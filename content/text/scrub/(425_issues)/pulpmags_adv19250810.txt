txjhe sun was setting the west-
f i  em sky was all gold and rose

the high mountains that encir-

- cled the bay had taken  a

shade of violet the white buildings of the
city of san asensio the vast cathedral with
its dome and campanile the opera house
the palace of justice the castle of old spain
the rows of tall houses and warehouses on
the quays were flooded with pink the
calm waters of the harbor far out into the
pacific reflected the brightness of the sky

already the heat of the day seemed more
bearable

on the bridge deck of the s s mizen

head mr cooper the second engineer sat
on the port side bunker hatch and smoked
his pipe and pondered

  how darned peaceful it all was how
calm how solemn almost and quiet and
how darned different from the mizen head
where nothing went right and there was dis-
cord and unpleasantness from first thing in
the morning to last thing at night

  from the galley there came the voice of
the cook talking with the steward-

  to look at him and hear him talk youd
think him a reglar man-eater till it come
to seein him in action an then youd know
him for what he is a wash-out

adventure

  hes weak thats what he is weak
said the steward an whats the result
look at the state the ships in

  no discipline said the cook

  ive had more trouble with the focsle
hands givin me lip about the grub this voy-
age than any voyage i can remember an i
been goin to sea now donkeys years

  a weak mans as bad as a bad man
said the cook in fack worse

  mr cooper frowned

  they were talking about the mate of
course a man hed been proud to think of
as his friend a man respected and liked
for three whole voyages and now despised
the cause of all the trouble aboard

  it was strange how that manner of the
mates-that man-eating manner as the
cook would pul it-should have helped him
carry things off his curtness his gruft-
ness his contempt for all those not up to his
standard of efficiency his cold anger had
made him feared no one had ever doubted
him no one had dared question either his
authority or his courage till now

  a penny for your thoughts mr cooper
the second engineer turned- his head
quickly

  the second mate a tall broad young
man with a florid beaming face and know-
ing eyes and a rather too patronising way of
talking was leaning with his back to the rail
smiling at him

  well mr mears what are you doing
  nothing just cooling off

  huh what from

  mr mears chuckled

  its bustin hot in the engine room and
it isnt hot on deck it never is is it you
engineers are always trying to make out you
have a worse time than anyone else on
board arent you

  and dont we said the third engineer
who had just come out on deck from the en-
gine room alley way dont we have a
worse time than any one else

  mr barker said mr cooper dry up
for the love of heaven

  the steward and the cook were still talk-
ing in the galley

  if you ask me whats the matter with
him id say hed got cold feet said the
steward hes yeller

  yes said the cook hes yeller i
seen a good deal o scrappin in my time an
ive seen fellers look like him when theyre
up against someone too big for them to

tackle scared an afraid to show it i
used kind of to admire him too but
now-lord

  talking about the mate arent they
said mr barker

  mr cooper nodded his head

  yes

  mr mears scowled and grunted

  pity they havent got something better
to do he said

  for some minutes no one spoke pres-
ently mr mears said-

  going ashore mr cooper

  mr cooper sucked at his pipe

  yes he was going ashore certainly
but the question was did he or did he not
wish to go ashore with the second mate
he didnt

  and so to avoid hurting the second
mates feelings he said nothing but con-
tinued to gaze dreamily as it were toward
the bridge of the vessel and the focsle head
visible under the lower bridge

  and then he saw the mate

he came out of the port side
saloon alley way glanced about
him nervously it seemed and
walked a few paces toward the
group by the bunker hatch as though
not quite sure what his welcome would be
he halted between the no  hatch and the
gangway and stood peering through half-
closed eyelids toward the bay and the open
roadstead and the steamers riding at anchor

  he was a lean square-shouldered man
not tall but strong and wiry his spare
hard face clean-shaven covered with tiny
wrinkles burnt a deep lan from exposure
to sun and wind was grave his lips were
pressed into a tight hard line his expres-
sion was grim and saturnine his eyes
were the eyes of a man who sees life as bitter
and full of disappointment even before
the disasters of the voyage when his author-
ity had been flouted and any self-respect he
mights have had destroyed he had made
few friends he was aloof and distant
taciturn slow in his movements like a cat
yet like a cat capable of intense activity
always he had been a mystery to his ship-
mates never more so than now

  mr cooper watched him intently and
considered

  he and the mate had little in common
days passed weeks even and they did not
see each other when they met they might
the miracle of the mission



exchange a dozen words or so perhaps no
more and yet he liked him

  he heard the second mate say suddenly
 to the third engineer

  yes thats true too weve been ship-
 mates him and me for three voyages and i
 know him no better than the day i first sav
 him why hasnt he ever said anything
 about himself whats he so quiet for
 why doesnt he try and be more friendly
 eh whats he afraid of us finding out
 eh he laughed his rather fat and oily
 laugh you wait one of these days youll
 hear something about the mate that ull
 surprize you

  something not to his credit eh said
 the third engineer eagerly

  the second mate grinned

  you wait he said

  mr cooper knocked the dottel out of his
 pipe against his heel

  talks cheap he said on your own
 showing mr mears you hardly know him
 do you

  i know him enough to know hes no
good anyhow

  hes good enough for me said mr
 cooper whats wrong with him eh

  the third engineer touched mr cooper
 on the shoulder

  look he said dont miss this
whatever you do

  bull mulligan the big deck hand who
 claimed that the heavyweight champion-
 ship of the world would have been his but
 for the booze was walking toward the gang-
 way

  he wore his best suit blue and rather
 tight in the chest and sleeves with a soft
 gray hat and was going ashore obviously

  the mate apparently had not seen him

  the second mate said

  heres whats wrong with him and
whats wrong with the ship too mulligan
hes so scared he darent say a word to him

 consequence is the hands do as they-

 well like

  mr cooper not quite certain what would
 happen but sensing trouble rose to his feet
 and advanced toward the mate and then
 in answer to mr mearss whispered appeal
 of wait man for the love of mike
 wait he halted

  mr mears a most unpleasant young man
 wriggled in an ecstasy of enjoyment

  the mate was standing between bull
mulligan and the gangway still peering

 over the wharf and the railway cars toward
 the sweeping roadstead and the red glow
 of the sunset and the distant hills

 all at once bull mulligan put his hand to
 his mouth and bellowed

gangway

 his voice matched his height and frame

 the mate pivoted swiftly

 mulligan nodded

 thats right mister i want to pass

 the mate said in his quiet way

 half a minute mulligan where are you
 going

 mulligan rested his hands on his hips

 where am i gain he boomed im
 goin  ashore is there any reason i shouldnt
 mister

 in comparison with mulligan the mate
 looked insignificant even puny the boxer
 was six or seven inches the taller of the two
 broader heavier by far his width of
 shoulder and the length of his arm was out
 of all proportion to his height so that he
 looked shorter than he really was

 the frown faded from his features he
 laughed

 mulligans reputation as a fighter his
 record as a professional in the ring against
 other professionals had made life easy for
 him aboard the mizen tlead no one in the
 focsle had dared to stand up to him it
 was his boast that not even the officers
 could make him do what he didnt want
 once hed made up his mind not to

 and though he had avoided trouble so
 far it seemed that at last he was in open con-
 flict with authority

 he stood leering at mr clarke his large
 head on one side his eyes screwed into two
 slits malicious and triumphant

 youre going ashore are yousaid the
 mate is that it

 thats it said mulligan im goin
 ashore

 i thought you were told to stay aboard

 the mates voice was low and his manner
 restrained yet every word he spoke carried
 clearly so that the cook and the steward
 ceased their talk and left the galley and
 stood with the second and third engineers
 and the second mate by the door of the fid-
 dley

 im not goin to stay aboard said mul-
 ligan not for you nor no one im going
 ashore you cant stop me

 he stepped back then and dropped his
 hands to his sides and waited


adventure

  the mate looked him up and down
casually as it were his face in the half light
grave composed stern

  by actual force perhaps not he said
all the same youre not going ashore
well then i am

  mulligan was growing angry

  you were told to stay aboard said the
mate youve been in trouble with the
police youve done no work for two days
you said this morning you were sick and
couldnt turn out you werent sick of
course if you were youre sick now go
forard and stay there

  mulligan said

  out o my way you djer hear me
out o my way or ill bust you one on the
jaw

  he brushed the mate to one side and
swaggered down the gangway

  the mate did not move

 my - said the second mate

would you believe it did you see that
did you thats what wevegot foramate
he walked to where mr clarke was
standing

mr cooper sorry that any man he called
his friend could show himself so weak yet
furious with the second mate followed him
the mate glanced over his shoulder
well mr mears he said

  i thought that man mulligan wasnt
to go ashore

  no said the mate mildly he wasnt
but hes gone what about it

  the second mate seemed taken aback
whats the sense in asking me that i
tell you mr clarke straight man to man
youve let us down all of us deck and en-
gine room mulligan treats you like dirt
dyou think we didnt see and hear what
he said its rotten thats what it is why
didnt you knock him down

  the mates lips twitched in a little smile
why didnt i knock him down why
should i

  why should you the second mate
spluttered because mulligan deliberately
disobeyed orders thats why he knows
now he can do as he likes youre afraid
of him

  am i said the mate quietly

  of course you are if you werent
youd have given him a smack on the jaw
mr cooper said gruffly

  youve got to be careful when youve
a man like mulligan to deal with hed

have eaten mr clarke and you know it
  the second mate laughed

  sure he would if hed had the chance
but would he hes a professional boxer
of course as good as any of em three years
ago i daresay good enough now in a free
for all-but whats that amount to if
youd hit him mr clarke taken a risk
for once as you ought to have done and
mulligan had tried any of his tricks hed
have had to tackle the lot of us see you
dont expect marquess o queensbury rules
aboard ship do you if a deck hand starts
rough-housin an officer pile on top of him
and kick his slats in thats western ocean
rules and good enough for any of us

  if youd been in my place mr mears
would you have hit mulligan

  hit mulligan said mr mears of

course id have hit him why the -

not mulligans a tough egg but hes hu-
man same as the rest of us isnt he

  there was a strange earnestness in the
mates voice

mr mears he said one
thing id like to ask you do you
really think i was afraid of mul-
ligan

  the second mate burst out furiously
youre afraid of him because he came
aboard drunk once and gave you some lip
you ought to have smashed him then but
you didnt youre afraid of him he knows
it and thats the reason theres been noth-
ing but-trouble aboard this ship since

we left new york

  the mate nodded then turneclon his heel
and walked slowly in the direction of the
saloon alleyway

the second mates face was flushed
say that settled him didnt it didnt
expect me to talk like that did he but
thats me all over im not scared if he is

the-little fool i hate a coward worse

than a pickpocket thats what he is a
coward

  mr cooper leaned on the rail

  was the second mate right or wasnt he
had the mate really been scared of mulli-
gan

  he remembered the expression in that
hard maghogany face the smile half
amused half ironical the little shrug of the
broad shoulders as mulligan had threatened
him he hadnt looked scared anyway
mebbe theres more in it than seems
the miracle of the mission



he said whatever the mate is mr
mears and i know him better than any
one else aboard this ship hes no coward
the second mate sneered

  shows you dont know him as well as
you think then anyway dont lets talk
of him he makes me sick

  mr cooper grunted

  mebbe you make him sick too mister
the third engineer laughed shortly
going ashore said the second mate
after a while

  mr cooper nodded

  yes and now once again he was
being forced to consider what his decision
would be did he or did he not intend
to go ashore with the second mate no
he didnt

  well go together eh said mr mears
any other night id be tickled to
death said mr cooper politely but to-
night its different

  different said the second mate and
the third engineer together

different said mr cooper stolidly
darkness had fallen the moon had not
yet risen nevertheless it was easy enough to
see that the second mate and the third en-
gineer were grinning broadly

  ive promised to pay a call on a friend
he said

  the second mate and the third engineer
broke into shouts of laughter

who is she said mr mears eh
when youve quite finished playing the
fool perhaps youll gimme a chance to ex-
plain i said id look in at the mission to-
night

  lord said mr mears thats the
weakest excuse i ever heard come on
mr cooper own up whats her name
im telling you the truth said mr
cooper the man whos running the
sailors mission here comes from the same
place i do i didnt know him back home

but hes a-good little man for a sky

pilot hes got a - tough job by the

look of things and im sorry for him id
be sorry for any man running a sailors
mission in a dump like this too he asked
me to come and see him tonight and have
a talk and i said i would

  well well said mr mears shaking
his head that i should live to hear of a
second engineer wasting valuable time at a
sailors mission would you believe it
youre a rum little beggar arent you

  not so rum as you are mister what
are you driving at

  you take up with such a - queer

crowd why dont you be sensible and
come along with me eh but you wont i
know youd rather be pals with men like
clarke and a sky pilot he laughed as one
who though annoyed yet tries to pretend
he is amused tell you what youll not
be dull anyway youll probably have quite
a jolly evening with mulligan

  dont get you said mr cooper

  the second mate laughed again

  from what they tell me mr cooper-
they bein the bosun and the third mate-
though how he knows beats me-from
what they tell me this bird mulligans got
a trick when hes well soused of dropping
into the mission whichever port hes in to
teach the merchant in charge where he be-
longs understand he doesnt hold with
missions mulligan doesnt he says its
his mission yunderstand to clean em up
im a bit of a reformer myself but i dont
indulge in it to that extent i must say if
mulligan gets busy when youre there mr
cooper dont you get cold feet plug
him one on the nose and see what hap-
pens

  ill have a darn good shot at it any-
how said mr cooper

  and then he saw that the mate was
on deck again leaning against the rail at
the second mates elbow smiling his half-
amused half ironical smile and for no
real reason mr cooper felt all of a sudden
uncomfortable as though he had been dis-
covered in something mean or not quite
honorable

 above the tinkle of a piano and
the voice of a man singing in a
rather high and feeble tenor an-
other voice deep and resonant
boomed out-

  stop it djer hear stop that noise
as though at a word of command the
music broke off abruptly

  mr cooper halted on the landing at the
head of a flight of stone steps outside the
rooms occupied by the sailors mission in
the house at the corner of the calle sala-
manca and the plaza de julio

  a man was peering through the half-open
door

  he turned

  mr cooper recognized him as an old


adventure

seaman employed by the mission as cook
and caretaker and storeman

  whats the trouble said mr cooper

  that fellers here again some day
therell be murder round here sure as my
names jones

  he stepped to one side and mr cooper
passed through the doorway and once more
ha ted

  the room was long and narrow lit by
electric light with four high windows all of
them open to the blue hot darkness one
overlooking the calle salamanca and the
other three facing the plaza here some
twenty or so seafaring men sailors and fire-
men sat on benches and chairs or stood with
their backs to mr cooper at the far end of
the room from the door was a low platform
with an upright piano and two men one on
his feet the other seated on a piano stool
both looking somewhat uneasy and staring
at bull mulligan who stood in the open
floor space between the platform and the
front row of benches and as mr cooper
watched he saw above the heads of the au-
dience mr simpson the chaplain to the
mission a little nervous lodking man with
graying hair and spectacles standing by
mulligans side apparently reasoning with
him the noise was so great it was impos-
sible to hear what he was saying

  mulligan who was obviously drunk was
laughing at him

  a man who stood on one of the benches
shouted

  good on yer bull thats the stuff

  some one tilted the bench and he fell
with a crash amid roars of laughter

  with no intention of interfering mr
cooper made his way slowly between the
rows of benches and a long table covered
with books and papers toward the far end
of the room

  whats that mulligan was saying
whats that mister

  he swayed on his feet and only saved
himself from falling so it seemed by grab-
bing the little mans shoulders

  youre spoiling the evening for every-
body said mr simpson

  that aint the truth on the face of it
said mulligan whats more the evenings
over those stiffs got to get back to their
ships if they dont mister leave em to

me ill clear em out pretty-quick

see me still keeping his left hand on
the chaplains shoulder he tapped his chest

with his right besh scrapper in san-
san francisco

  san asensio said a voice where
you think you are bull

  mulligan laughed and shook his head
well well-he seemed as it were
amused by his own befuddlement-that
splains everyzing dont it an me lookin
for market street an geary an kearney
an the ol barbary coast dance halls all
evenin ehl well well

  hadnt you better be going said mr
simpson

  thats ri said mulligan thats
why i got up i wouldnt slay no longer
place li this mister im goin where feller
can have some fun unstand but firs
all i wanna tell you this places poison
unstand run all wrong falsh prenees
wha you wanna tice spectable men in
dive li this for eh he flung his right
arm in the direction of the platform and
the singer and his accompani st wha
you wanna have couple pie-faced tom-cats
squallin hymns for eh

  not hymns friend said mr simpson
were rehearsing one or two songs for our
concert the day after tomorrow

  another lie said mulligan how you

it was sings he was hymnin hymns he was

feebly it was an im no frien o yours
neither see an now dont get excited
bad for you im goin i wouldn shtay
nother minute polluted amosphere im
gon smash that grinnin ape at the pianner
first

  mr simpson grabbed his jacket and held
him mulligan tried to free himself the
singer and the accompanist slid off the plat-
form and cscaped

  the audience shouted

  listen said mr simpson earnestly
listen to reason please

  this here place is too much like a prayer
meetin to please me said mulligan i
got a good mind never to come here again
it makes no difference to me whether
you come or not if you do come i insist
on your behaving yourself in a decent man-
ner the little mans face was pink i
want to help you but if you dont want to
be helped im powerless if youre intent
on making a beast of yourself youve got
all the city to do it in leave the mission
alone
the miracle of the mission



  mulligan rocked with laughter

  - if i wanna make a beast o my-
self which ive a good mind to smack your
face for sayn so ill do it wherever i
choose nex thing i spose youll tell me
i mustnt bring whisky here eh

  i certainly wouldnt permit you to
bring whisky here and you know it

  well how you gon to stop me eh
said mulligan i brought a bot in wi me
jus now you cant take it away neither
cause why its inside me again he
shouted with tipsy laughter and the other
men standing around shouted too any-
way im tired the way this ol missions
run if i hadn to go meet friend o mine
an if it wasn so late id show what i
mean wha we wan s a lil life an e-
cilemen prayins no good why not
gives a dance eh li this

  he grabbed the little chaplain around his
body with his big arms and yelled

  hi strike up a tune one o you stiffs
gives a it rag time me an the sky
pilots gon to dance

  and then mr cooper interfered
  mulligan he said cut that out

  he grabbed mulligans arm

  mulligan turned and glared he let go
his grip on the little chaplain

  its you is it the revren cooper
second engneer o the mizeti head his
lips parted in a wide grin showing yellow
discolored teeth another sky pilot eh
taken bad with religion are yer or what
im gon show you darn preachers you
cant take away the few pleasures we poor
stiffs got left were men we are not
anmals

  he thrust his face forward to within
a couple of inches of mr coopers and
scowled

  mr cooper stayed where he was he
hoped mulligan wouldnt see how scared he
was he said doggedly

  youd better clear out mulligan be-
fore theres more trouble you want the
police do you

  the police yah mulligan sneered
 listen fellers these pie-cans cant tackle
things themselves like other men they got
to send for the lousy police thats their
way o spreadin religion theyll feed yer
prayers an hymns an such-like slop in
buckets an then if you wont swaller the
dope its send for the police he grinned
at mr cooper here uttle man do yer

know what im goin to do to the police if
they come here do yer

no said mr cooper i dont but
do you know what im going to do to you
again mulligan who seemed to have sud-
denly grown sober thrust his face close to
his

  well boy what are you goin to do
eh

  this said mr cooper

  he lashed out with his right and hit
mulligan on the tip of his flat nose with all
his strength

  he heard a bellow of rage and then be-
fore he could make a move to guard him-
self before he realized quite what was bound
to happen mulligans heavy fist crashed
there was a hash like lightning before his
eyes a stabbing agony across his forehead
and he fell

  before he could stir mulligan pounced on
him he grabbed him around the neck and
dragged him to his feet and shook him

  you little swine he said you pukin
little swine

  mr cooper dazed and suffocated but
grimly determined not to show that he was
hurt raised his hands and clutched at the
deck hands wrist and tried to free himself

mulligan snarled and swung
him round his feet dragging the
floor boards

  the pressure on his throat was
intolerable he could not breathe he felt
that his senses were leaving him he
heard as at a distance screams of laughter
some one was saying

  let him be cant you you mulligan
you blackguard let him be

  and then the pressure on his throat was
relaxed and he was flung helplessly against
a table and collapsed

  he lay for a moment on the floor stunned
exhausted blinking at the lights above him

  when he raised his head mulligan was
dusting his hands lightly and grinning

  thats the style mr cooper thats the
way i treats sky pilots an such-like scum
now you go aboard an tell them brass-
bound stiffs what i done to you tell em
an ask what they got to say about it see
tell that ruddy mate but you done more
than hed do anyway you hit me if

i hadnt been in such a-good temper

tonight along o what ive drunk id ha
turned you over my knee an spanked you


adventure

like i spank my kid brother if youd ha
been a grown man mister you might ha
hurt me but next time you take any

liberties wi me-help you know who

i am im fightin bull mulligan heavy-
weight champion o the pacific ocean an
the atlantic an im out to shut down

these-missions that are makin the life

o poor seafarin men misrable im gon
now but ill be back tomorrer some
time see annot alone neither whats-
your-name - you simpson - you listen
you gimme a pain for two pins id push
the back o your head through yer glass
winders understand im fightin bull
mulligan i am an dont you forget it when
you say yer prayers

  mulligan jerked first one shoulder for-
ward then the other thrust out his chest
brought his hands up to a fighting attitude
made two or three sparring motions with his
arms ducked his head scowled stamped
his left foot grinned and walked out

  mr cooper scrambled to his feet

  are you hurt said mr simpson
n-no said mr cooper dont think
so heads on my shoulders anyway
the room was emptying most of the
men had already drifted out after mulligan
a few still lingered

  the cook and the steward of the mizen
head drew near

  mr cooper the cook said im proud
to know you ive not seen anythin half
as good as that punch o yours since jack
johnson fought tommy burns or that
bumboat woman at marseilles hit the sal-
vadors skipper youre all right you are
i tell you it takes some pluck to stand up to
bull mulligan but you done it

  the steward was pessimistic

  mr cooper im warnin you he said
you look out for mulligan hes bad
medicine

  i wouldnt have thought you had it in
you said the cook youre not what
id call a hercles are yer mulligan is
whats more booze dont seem to make no
difference to him he was half canned to-
night

  else mebbe said the steward you
wouldnt have got off so easy

  easy said mr cooper look at
my eye

  dont worry about that mister said
the cook i got a piece o steak aboard
thatll get that right in no time well

glad i lived long enough to see that punch
o yours good-night all

  an dont forget what i told you mr
cooper said the steward you look out
for mulligan soon as hes sobered up hell
want to just about half kill you

  when the last sailor had gone and the
door leading to the stairs was locked mr
simpson said in a tired voice

  mr cooper im afraid youve had
rather a tough deal

  mr cooper grinned

  i ought to apologize oughtnt i mebbe
if i hadnt have hit mulligan first thered
have been no trouble he chuckled all
the same im glad if you dont mind
mr simpson i dont its all in the days
work isnt it if i hurt him only half as
much as he hurt me ive done some good in
the world

  im not in favor of brawling of course
or fighting either mr cooper its against
my principles naturally turn the other
cheek you know but with mulligan its
different the little man sighed im
inclined to think mr cooper that you
saved us if you hadnt hit him when you
did and so to speak distracted his atten-
tion-yes as sound and as shrewd a blow
as i ever saw-if you hadnt done that he
and his friends would have given me more
trouble than they did

  they sat on chairs by one of the open
windows the arc lamps cast an orange
glow on the plaza de julio with its palm
trees and fountain and the crowd of men
and women strolling to and fro and the
clanging street cars to the left between
white buildings the lights of the shipping in
the harbor shone in the blue darkness the
big bell of the cathedral tolled the half
hour

  mr simpson put his hands to his worn
face

  im weary and heartsick he comes
here every night mulligan does on one pre-
text or another he says hell wreck the
mission ruin me drive me out of san
asensio

  hes nothing against you personally
mr simpson has he

  why should he have said the little
man why should he his hand opened
and shut on the window sill he looked
old and sick hes one of those men you
cant handle through ordinary means he
seems to have no decent instincts not
the miracle of the mission

ii

even sportsmanship i wanted to help him
he made mock of me yet how can i
biame him mr cooper when i think of
those men mulligan and his kind in a port
like this the prey of the scum of the earth
robbed by harpies male and female abused
debauched diseased god almighty i
feel- he raised his hand to his throat
i feel that im being choked i want to
do some good in the world and i cant
im useless

  mr cooper considered how little after
all he knew of the history of the man by
whose side he sat

  you had a church back home didnt
you

  did you ever go inside that church
mr cooper no you didnt how many
men did a few not many you and
the others you stayed outside i had a
church yes half empty a congregation of
women well-dressed well-to-do idle you
may say wherever one is theres the lords
work waiting to be done i dont know
my life was too easy too pleasant i was
soft and flabby in body and mind and soul

i grewself-indulgent i had neither am-
bition nor spirituality i degenerated

  the little man dabbed at his damp fore- 
head with a rolled-up pocket handkerchief

and then mr cooper my
eyes were opened there was
work that i should have done
that i avoided i might have
brought comfort to a dying woman and i
didnt she was one of those poor creatures
i considered bad her son a sailor home
from a voyage came to me after she was
dead and said things that hurt i saw my-
self as he saw me i knew-we neednt go
into that part of it now-i knew that if i
wanted to redeem myself i must take on a
mans work you understand i had to
do something that wouldnt be easy

  mr cooper all my instincts were to stay
where i was with my friends my church
my congregation my home my library
but i didnt dare i was afraid i heard
of this mission work among seamen and i
felt it was what i was looking for it was
its harder than i thought but its the
the right work for me i ought to explain
mr cooper at heart im a coward its
taken more out of me than you might think
to have to mingle with sailors seamen
firemen and such-like one of my great

failings my many failings was narrow-
mindedness i judged others by hard
and fast standards right was right wrong
wrong i was bigoted i hadnt learnt the
great lesson of charity id preached to the
well-to-do the respectable the sheltered
i hadnt met with sin in the raw no mr
cooper i wasnt one of those men who
can go out into the street and bring comfort
to sinners i hated sin i hated the sinner
i never saw i was a sinner myself mr
cooper i never realized that there are
worse sins than the sins of the flesh what
kind of a man would i be if i had to live in
a tramp steamer focsle worse than i am
now or better better perhaps why
yes better by far

  mr cooper i made up my mind when i
left home and came to san asensio that
id make a success of my work id do some
good in the world if i could id help
others to gain a little happiness id try
id learn the meaning of humility sacrifice
forbearance never so long as i lived would
i judge any man as id judged men in the
past ive tried my utmost-its not been
easy-and now after all this time im
faced with the consciousness of failure yes
ive failed failed badly the men have
no respect for me they laugh at me yes
its the truth laugh at me

  what they need is a-good kicking

said mr cooper

  no friend thats where youre wrong
no theyre good men at heart sound
likeable but they want teaching what
chance have most of them had mulligan
now what chance has he had

  id chance him said mr cooper with
a monkey wrench on the top of his blasted
head

  no mr cooper please thats not
right he needs instruction its igno-
rance mr cooper ignorance and to-
night when i ought to have been patient
with him i lost my temper im hopeless
youre not said mr cooper youre
doing fine

  i wish i could think so i need to look
at things from mulligans point of view
he thinks im interfering with his happiness
thats why he dislikes me you under-
stand he feels it his duty to make my
work here impossible if he can

  for a long time neither spoke then mr
simpson said

  i cant give in i cant


adventure

  he rose to his feet and stood looking out
of the window into the night

  i must find some way mr cooper to
teach mulligan his lesson there must be
something that will help me there is a
way surely

  mr cooper didnt stay very much longer
he drank a cup of coffee and said it was
time to be going

  he wondered dubiously as he walked
quickly across the plaza and down on to the
quays how mr simpson would deal with
mulligan when he next visited the mission
the little man talked of a way to teach him
his lesson the lesson mulligan needed was

a-good hiding from some one bigger

and stronger than himself and where was
that some one to be found not on the
mizen head anyway

  from early morning mr cooper had been
aware that his quarrel with mulligan was
known from one end of the ship to the other
he pretended that he did not care he
did care enormously

  he went about his work in the engine
room tormented by the knowledge that
the firemen and trimmers were smiling at
him and whispering

  he strained his ears to hear what they
said while showing no sign of interest

  once he heard the donkeyman say to the
storekeeper

  what in-s the good o buttin in

where hes not wanted he goes on doin
things any fool should have known better
not to an then when he gets a smack in the
eye-

  the storekeeper glanced quickly over his
shoulder ssh he whispered softly and
clattered up the ladder to the store

  the donkeymen turned once more to the
vise bench where he was cutting disks of
gauze wire to the shape of a joint for a
steam pipe

  they were talking about himself mr
cooper knew

  at dinner in the engineers mess room a
hot and unsavory meal the gruff old chief
growled at him

  mr cooper when are you going to be-
gin learning sense

  how do you mean sir

what right had you to go interfering
with that big deck hand last night you
ought to have had more sense you might
have known hed just about kill you
why should we knuckle under to a

swine like mulligan said mr cooper
hotly

  whos talking about knuckling under
you leave the deck hands alone-youre
not a deck officer another thing let the
sky pilot up at the mission do his own
dirty work youve been going to sea long
enough now to know you get no thanks for
doing more than youre paid to do dont
interfere with other people thats my ad-
vice try and follow it

  i may have laid myself open to a black
eye from mulligan said mr cooper
but im blessed if i see even now what else
i could do he glanced around the table
the faces of the third and fourth engineers
gave him no very great encouragement
any one else would have done what i did
he said

  the chief engineer grunted

  i doubt it not if they were sane any-
way

  mr cooper said no more he wished now
hed never met simpson he wished hed
never gone to the mission he wished-
after all was it fair to blame little simpson
for what wasnt his fault

  and then all the stubbornness in his na-
ture rose in revolt simpson was a friend
of his hed stand by him he didnt
care if he had to face fifty mulligans what
could mulligan do nothing

  mr cooper did not meet any of the
mates until he had finished his work for
the day

  and then as he sat in his own room
smoking a pipe wondering what he should
do with himself till bed time there was a
sound of quick footsteps and a knock at the
door

come in he said

  the second mate entered
before mr cooper could say
a word he broke into a shout of
laughter

  the hero he said behold the hero
the fighting man the conqueror of fight-
ing bull mulligan he flung up his right
hand toward the ceiling and placed his left
hand on his heart the hero the he-
man with red blood and a black eye

  dont be a blasted fool said mr
cooper

  the second mate dropped his hands to
his sides and chuckled

  i wont mr cooper youve taken ten
the miracle of the mission



years off my life gosh when i heard
how youd tackled mulligan i said to my-
self thats the man for my money
johnny cooper the man with the ko
punch in passing my lad ill remark
that mulligans nose is one of the juiciest
sights ive seen

mr cooper was not amused he said
rather grimly

 sit down mr mears be sensible or
 else beat it

 the second mate dropped on to the settee
 his plump and florid face very serious al-
 most too serious his wise eyes twinkling

 look-a-here he said whatever made
 you want to go getting mixed up in a scrap
 with mulligan for eh

 hes trying to wreck the mission

 let him said the second mate whats
 the odds the mizcn bead wont be lying
 in san asensio for ever soons this lighter-
 mens strike is over and we load our cargo
 well be away and the feller in charge of die
 mission ull get busy again if youd had a
 real reason for hitting mulligan i wouldnt
 mind-but you hadnt

 mr cooper felt that he did not like mr
 mears and never would he might be a
 friendly enough sort of man but there was
 a mean streak in him that spoilt him

 the second mate went on-

 if you let deck hands roughhouse you
 like that whats to become of the rest of us
 discipline and all that sort o thing eh

 mr cooper growled

 discipline theres- little aboard

 this packet so far as i can see anyway
 and what else can you expect with a
 mate like weve got

 whats wrong with the mate
 nothing said mr mears oh noth-
 ing only what you did last night or tried
 to he wouldnt dare and why not be-
 cause hes a coward

 there was another knock at the door and
 the mates voice said

 you there mr cooper

 come in mr clarke

 the second mate grinned sheepishly

 -the mate tight-lipped grim saturnine
 haggard glanced at him and nodded im-
 perceptibly almost

 mr cooper i feel like a walk ashore
 will you come

 you bet said mr cooper

 seems to me said the second mate
 youre more popular than id imagined

 you were i was just going to ask you to
 come ashore with me

  but you didnt said mr cooper

  hm dont want to make it a three-
some do you said the second mate

  no said the mate coldly no mr
mears you and i see enough of each other
in the ordinary course of events without
spoiling the evening for both of us

  the second mate grinned

  all right dont blame you mister
he turned to mr cooper who saw in his
expression a strange spite well mister
youll be able to put in a useful hour or so
hunting your pal mulligan

  whats happened to him

  been missing since yesterday afternoon
mebbe you scared him last night if you
see him fetch him aboard the two of you
ought to be able to manage him or if you
cant you better get the sky pilot from the
mission to lend a hand

  the mate said

  mr mears you talk a-sight more

thans good for your health get out
the second mate glared and then lowered
his eyes suddenly gave a shrug of his broad
shoulders and walked out

  mr cooper was puzzled but said nothing
when they reached the quay the mate
said

  if i dont get some exercise ill croak
lets walk

  they tramped in silence away from the
city out along the dusty road past white
villas and big gardens full of flowering
shrubs and trees into the open country
four miles to the point where the lighthouse
flashed its red-and-white light and the surf
thundered sluggishly on the rocks far be-
neath the full moon shone on the calm
waters of the pacific far out at sea there
showed the lights of a steamer bound south

  for the first time since they had left the
quay the mate spoke

  - its fine i tell you mister its

this kind o thing that makes you see how
little good youve done in the world and
how much harm you feel you want to
be better and never do wrong any more
thats how it gets me anyway

  mr cooper said nothing

  ive done a heap of harm in my time
the mate continued in his low deep voice
but theres this-ive paid for it yes

by- ive paid for it

  mr cooper was startled


adventure

 harm what harm had the mate done
 there wasnt a straighter cleaner more
 honorable man going to sea than he was
 there was only the one possible thing
 against him

 and suddenly though he knew he was
 doing wrong against all reason and com-
 mon sense he spoke of what was troubling
 him

 mr clarke he said you know what
 theyre saying about you on board dont
 you

 no said the mate staring out to sea
 what

 they say youre afraid of mulligan

 do they said the mate he did not
 even appear interested

 they say the discipline on the ships
 one to pieces because mulligan can do as
 e likes with you

 oh said the mate do you believe
 that

 mr cooper hesitated

 no i dont

 the mate nodded

 thank you he said

 after that he was silent again mr
 cooper decided he was even more difficult
 to understand than he had imagined

 the minutes passed the mate jumped
 to his feet

 lets move he said

 the big bell of the cathedral was
 striking nine when they reached
 the big square in the center of
 the city the plaza de san juan
 neither had said a word on the way back
 from the light house at the point they
 halted by the colonnade of the palace of
 justice

 care for a drink said the mate

 suppose so said mr cooper yes

 he wondered then what had become of
 mr simpson he felt a twinge of remorse
 he had abandoned a friend he ought he
 knew now to have stopped at the mission
 as soon as he came ashore and asked if
 mulligan had been there or if there was any-
 thing he could do

 i ought to go across to the mission and
 see if everythings all right he said

 the mission said mr clark what-
 ever for

 im afraid mulligan will have been there
 making trouble

 mister said the mate you let those

mission people look after their own affairs
take it from me no good comes from getting
yourself mixed up with parsons and reli-
gion

  mr cooper found himself out of his
depth the more he saw of the mate the
more perplexed he was the man was a
mystery

  and then while he hesitated not know-
ing what to say next he heard a chuckle of
unsober laughter and turning saw mulligan

  hullo you two hullo the depty
sky pilot an the mate look at em

  the mate grim and stern looking and
yet as mr cooper realized with a pang
physically a coward said-

  mulligan why werent you on board
today

  why said mulligan because i
didnt choose thats why he winked at
mr cooper ive got busness shore
here portant busness im gon bust
the mission unstan im gon there
to-ni i am to take that guy simpson an
welt the life out him unstan soons
ive had nother whisky im gon me an
some pals o mine he laughed if you
two ain don nothin in pertickler you bet-
ter come an see me wreck the joint

  youd better go back aboard mulligan
unless you want to get into trouble youre
making a nuisance of yourself im getting
tired of it

  mulligan rose on his toes and lowered
himself on to his heels he dug his hands
into his trouser pockets and grinned

  youre gettin tired are yer well
mister im not one o those men you can
bluff like you can the others see youve
got to treat me rough or ill treat you
rough thats the sorta man i am see
spose i gi you a shove in the face eh
whatll you do then get more tired or
what

  mr cooper glanced from one to the
other an arc lamp cast a glow on their
brown faces but whereas the deck hand
smiled easily as though sure of himself the
mate looked worried and anxious there
was an uneasiness in his eyes that seemed
to express the fear he felt

  a sudden shame swept over mr cooper
the mate had said out at the point that he
had done wrong that might be but he had
done no greater wrong than in letting the
focsle hands of the mizen head know he was
a coward he was smaller than mulligan
the miracle of the mission



of course and lighter yet so strong so
muscular and active that his disinclination
to risk a thrashing degraded him and put
him on a lower level than even mulligan
himself

  well said mulligan spose i gi you
a shove in the face

  he thrust his face nearer the mates

  the mate backed mulligan followed him

  two or three people had stopped in the
colonnade to watch

  spose i gi you a shove in the face
said mulligan once more

  it was then that mr cooper interfered
for the second time

  the mate was a coward nevertheless
he was his friend was he to stand aside and 
watch mulligan crow over him - no

  he abandoned all discretion and put him-
self boldly between the mate and the deck
hand

  mulligan he said you get to-

out o here beat it

  for a moment mulligan gaped at him and
did not speak it seemed from the gog-
gling expression in his eyes that he was too
amazed almost too stunned to be angry

  he laughed

  well my bantam i thought id settled
you last night for keeps i wont hit you
again no i guess i got more human-
ity

  he shot out his right arm the heel of
the palm of his hand caught mr cooper a
terrific blow under the chin jerked back
his head with a wrench that jarred his spine
and sent him staggering into the arms of a
man who caught and held him

  you try buttin in once more said
mulligan jus once an ill lick yer
proper

  thatll do mulligan said the mate
cut it out

  cut it out eh who ses so

  mr cooper put his hands to his neck
he felt sick and dizzy even now he would
have fallen but for the arm that supported
him	

  mulligan and the mate argued

  you say so do yer said the deck hand
im glad to hear it an now seein youve
said all you got to say im goin to round
up my pals an then im goin to turn ol
simpson out into the street an duck him
that little stiff wants to close the town up
he does well before he does ill close him
up tight an fast

  you wont said the mate

  mr cooper a little less weak and tottery
was amazed that he still stood his ground
he watched fascinated and a little awed
he himself could do no more mulligan
was too much for him too strong too
fierce

  and then he became aware that a stout-
ish elderly prosperous looking man red
faced clean shaven wearing evening clothes
with a white shirt front and a panama hat
was holding him by one arm and speaking
to him

  a friend of yours may i ask he
nodded toward the mate

  yes said mr cooper he frowned
and tried to think was it you who saved
me from falling im much obliged im
sure

  dont mention it please might i ask
your friends name

  mr cooper freed his arm he resented
the stout elderly strangers question just
as he resented the presence of a group of
grinning spectators but there was some-
thing in his voice and manner and look that
almost compelled him to give an answer

  his names clarke he said

  clarke said the stout man he looked
so mr cooper thought startled and almost
horrified

  the deck hand was laughing in the mates
face

  youve tried to bluff me all the voyage
well then i called your bluff last night
you climbed down didnt you youre no
good mr clarke youre a coward you
talk big an thats all an why ill tell
yer you darent youre yeller

  mr cooper heard the stout elderly gen-
tleman by his side gasp

  the mate and the big deck hand con-
tinued to stare at each other as though
neither dared withdraw his eyes

  the deck hand chuckled

  youre goin to prove yerself a better
man than me are yer you cant not
you were not at sea now mister you
picked on me from the start didnt yer

you were mate i was a poor-a b you

had the power didnt you or you
thought you had ive got it now you
know it too without layin a hand on yer
ive smashed yer why that misrable
little second engineers got more guts an
grit in him than you have an hes nothin to
boast about whether or no but you ive
i

adventure

 smashed yer see now jus you wait
 mister-ill prove it look here
 mulligan extended a knobby forefinger
 and prodded mr clarke on the chin

 you see thats what i think o yer

 youve done yer best to make life-for

 me aint yer now mebbe im makin

 life-for you im showin you up ive

 seen through yer mr clarke an ive got
 your goat

 there was an expression of agony in the
 mates face his teeth covered his lower lip
 he said nothing but did not give way

 mulligan puzzled it seemed by the mates
 continued inactivity went on

 youre no good mr clarke youre a
 yeller coward id rather be that little pukin
 sky pilot in the mission than id be you
 mister a thousand times djer get me
 he prodded the mate in the stomach
 the mate continued to stare straight at
 him

 the second engineer had a lump in his
 throat

 not only was the mate a friend he was a
 shipmate mulligan was trying to break
 him before strangers he was making him
 look small he was torturing him

 he wouldnt allow him he
 mustnt it wasnt decent

 the mate to be humiliated by
 a half-drunk deck hand

 he said

 mr clarke lets get out o here whats
 the use of stopping and arguing with a man
 like that

 mulligan snarled out of the side of his
 mouth

 shut up you djer hear mr clarke
 you stop where you are he laid hold of
 his arm mr clark i want you to hit me
 hit me as hard as you can goon ill let
 you

 his eyes danced with excitement he
 grinned he shook the mates arm

 go on mister hit me

 and then he swore

 -it didnt i know it didnt i

 say so you darent hit me

 the stout elderly red faced gentleman
 said in a kind of low drawl

 i bet he dare

 the mate turned his head and looked at
 him his face a blank

 the stout elderly gentleman said-

 well clarke how are you

  the mate said hoarsely-

  arent you making a mistake

  no said the stout gentleman im
not you know im not

  youre making a mistake repeated the
mate

  youre the man i used to know said
the stout gentleman you may have for-
gotten me but i havent forgotten you
no said mulligan an i aint sur-
prized neither who would

  the mate walked quickly to the stout
gentleman and drew him aside and whis-
pered in his ear he seemed to be pleading
with him

  mr cooper heard mulligan speaking to
him

  well he said what is it you touch
me again mulligan and youll wish youd
never been born

  spoke like a hero said the deck hand
thats the stuff bunk i got your num-
ber same as i got his he jerked his
thumb in the direction of mr clarke
same as i got simpsons ive got the lot
o you eatin out o my hand an now im
goin

  where to said mr cooper

   same as i told yer the mission
what harm has the mission done you
none but it soon will if that little tick
gets goin same as he wants to whatll
become of us poor seafarin men if he has
his way an spreads his religion sos theres
nothin to do in a place like this no booze
no gals nothin but hymns an prayers at
that - mission o his see hes an-
other thats always interferin with what
dont concern him im goin to make mr
moldy simpson know when its best for
him to get out an stay out

  and with that bull mulligan swung
round and swaggered away in the direction
of the calle salamanca and the plaza de
julio and the mission

  mr cooper disturbed and worried
turned to the mate but the mate was still
talking to the elderly stout rod-faced gen-
tleman in the shadow of the colonnade of
the palace of justice

  and thats how it was he was saying
just that

  more than twenty years
twenty-three said the mate
twenty-three the stout gentleman
nodded his head so it is so it is
twenty-three years you oughtnt to have
the miracle of the mission



done it why didnt you stay and face
things out

  i couldnt said the mate i was sick
of it sick of myself sick of every one else
you see i met his girl and his mother
that just about-well just about finished
me off

  and you went to sea

  before the mast ordinary seaman
then ab yeh now im mate of the
mizen head i climbed aboard through the
hawse pipe as they say and proud of it
im in the running for the next command
if-if i five this down

  live what down

  the mate gave a shrug of his shoulders
  didnt you see

  man why havent you more sense
  they call me yellow

  yellow and youve never shown them
  never why should i

  youre doing yourself harm in every
way possible its not fair

  the second engineer feeling that he was
hstening to what he was not intended to
hear turned and hurried in the direction of
the mission it was all very well this meet-
ing between the mate and his opulent look-
ing friend but if he stayed any longer
waiting mulligan and his gang would have
reached the mission and thered be trouble

  when he arrived at the comer of the
calle salamanca and the plaza de julio he
saw that there were no lights burning in
the mission rooms above the comer store
he halted and gazed at the dark windows
a sudden surge of fear swept over him
suppose mulligan and his gang had
visited the mission earlier in the evening
while he and the mate had been walking out
to the point

  he blamed himself he ought to have
had more sense

  the old caretaker who looked after the
mission appeared in the dark doorway

  jones said mr cooper wheres mr
simpson has anything happened

  no sir not that im aware of said
the old man he didnt show up tonight
hes sick so we didnt open the mission at
all im goin now to see whats wrong with
him an ask whether hell hold the concert
tomorrer or not

  and then he stumped off down the calle
salamanca

  mr cooper reassured turned and went
in search of the mate

once again after another long
hot day of hard work in the en-
gine room mr cooper stood in
the sailors mission near the plat-
form and talked with the little chaplain

  he was anxious

  therell be trouble he said i know
it

  even now the room was crowded with
men from the ships held up in san asensio
by the lightermans strike noisy and bois-
terous some of them half drank and out of
hand already

  therell be no trouble said mr simpson
he seemed strangely elated his face
showed no sign of agitation or uneasiness-
his eyes were calm

  friend he said since i last saw you
two nights ago ive seen the light yes i
was tempted i lost heart and courage i
became a coward

  but last night you were sick surely
said mr cooper quickly

  i was sick yes said mr simpson

  mr cooper was glad a weigh t was lifted
from his mind

  i was sick physically and mentally a
touch of malaria mr cooper that trou-
bled me far less than the despair that had
seized me i went down into the depths
but i fought my way up again and im here
once more healed and in my right mind
yes mulligan can do me no harm now
mr simpson listen to me mulligan and
his friends will be here tonight hes de-
termined to wreck the mission i know
that for a fact look at the crowd they
know as well as i do

  mulligan may come friend but he can
do no harm he can avail nothing against
the might of the lord ive erred-erred
grievously i permitted self to enter in
fear pride distrust i relied on myself i
thought of myself i distrusted myself
ive failed worse than ever before in my
life but now thank god thats ended
the way has been made plain to me ive
help that cannot fail

  mr cooper was out of his depth once
more perplexed startled

  help that cannot fail he said dully
you mean police protection

  he glanced doubtfully about the crowded
room and wondered what the sailors and
firemen present would do with the police
of san asensio if they tried to interfere
with them
i

adventure

no mr cooper said the
little chaplain not earthly help
but prayer ive been false to
my trust my faith my work in
everything by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving let your requests be made
known if tilings have gone wrong in this
mission if my thoughts are heavy with a
sense of failure the faults mine i lacked
faith whoso trusteth in the lord happy
is he you remember that mr cooper do
you also-they that trust in the lord
shall be as mount zion friend tonight
in this room youll see the might of the
lord made manifest either mulligan will
stay away or hell give no trouble if he
comes hell be taught his lesson through
some chosen instrument-

  mr cooper interrupted

  talking of instruments he said what
about this i dunno one better in a tight
place he produced from his pocket a
brass knuckle duster manufactured that
morning in the engine room

 no mr cooper no mr simpson
shook his head ill have no fighting
im afraid no longer everything will go well
with me

  mr cooper frowned the man was mad
of course he turned away with a shrug

 to his surprize he saw the second
mate and the third engineer enter the
room

 he dropped limply on to one of the
benches reserved for officers set against the
wall by the open floor space in front of the
platform and at right angles to the other
benches

  the second mate and the third engineer
came and sat by his side

  he greeted them with a nod

  the third engineer said-

  why did you slip off by yourself mr
cooper without telling us

  he said

  what are you two here for eh

  the second mates plump face twisted
into a knowing grin he winked

  for the same reason youre here for o
course theres not so much-excite-
ment in san asensio that a fellers going to
risk missing a riot is he mulligan and
his gang are going to raise cain and if you
dont believe me look at the mob here
when did you ever see a crowd like this at
a mission concert theyre here because
they know mulligans coming

  i wonder if hes arrived said the third
engineer

  mr cooper stared through the clouds of
tobacco smoke at the faces but could see no
trace of mulligan

  seen the mate to-night he asked pres-
ently

  no he was in his berth when i came
ashore whats this i hear about mulligan
hitting him in the jaw last night

  its not true mr mears whatever you
heard

  mr mears again winked and chuckled

  i was with him said mr cooper
mulligan didnt hit him

  the second mate didnt believe him he
knew he believed like every one else on
board the mizen head that mulligan had
given the mate a thrashing and what if he
did let him

  what earthly difference did it make what
a pup like the second mate believed

  mr cooper pondered

  tonight would see the end of the stran-
gest episode of his life the most trouble-
some and the most disquieting

  when ever before had he been thrown
into contact with three men so diverse in
their nature as these three the mate mr
simpson mulligan

  the mate who was his friend was a cow-
ard simpson who was his friend was crazy
they had the same enemy these two-mul-
ligan both were afraid of him the mate
let mulligan do as he liked with him with-
out raising a hand in his own defence
little simpson declared he had found all
the help he needed in prayer

  mr cooper was worried and restless
why was it he pondered that he should take
the troubles of other men so to heart why
was it he wasnt able to look at things from
a detached standpoint but must needs mix
himself up with what didnt concern him

  he was in no mood to talk he heard
against a background as it were of deep
voices shouts and laughter the second mate
and the third engineer talking

  if the mans as much a coward as all
that said mr mears its time to get rid
of him ive said so before but whats
the good of me saying anything im
only a second mate lord how i hate a
coward

  how can they expect to have any dis-
cipline on board a ship a ship like the
mizen head said the third engineer
the miracle of the mission



pompously with a mate who dont give

a-what the hands think of him

  i always did think there was something

-funny about clarke ever seen that

queer look in his eyes shifty i call it
and thats what he is shifty all through
the third engineer yawned

  wonder when this darned concerts
goin to start im sick of it its action i
craves action an plenty of it hullo
whats his nibs yapping about now eh
mr simpson so the second engineer sud-
denly realized was speaking he stood on
the platform and appealed for silence

  if you men will kindly be quiet at the
back there were ready to begin the enter-
tainment the first item on our program
is a song that we all know with a rousing
chorus that i want you all to sing he held
a slip of paper close to his spectacles the

name of the song is-

  mr cooper not in the least interested in
the name of the song or the concert or any-
thing except mulligan turned his head

  the long room right to the far end by
the door was jammed with men from the
ships in their faces he could see expec-
tancy and excitement the noise that had
died down for a moment rose again

  there was a shout of get on with it
not so much jaw you with the glass
winders

  mr cooper looked once more toward the
platform

  mr simpson stepped down to the level
of the floor a tall thin nervous young-
ster advanced and took his seat on the piano
stool another stouter and with pink
cheeks stood by his side

  the pianist played a few bars and then
glanced over his shoulder toward his com-
panion

  the stout pink-cheeked lad began to sing
and at once the audience yelled and
clapped and stamped their feet

  a hoarse voice from the end of the room
bellowed-

  thats enough light the binnacle boy

get to-out o there-sharp

  the music stopped

bull mulligan strode through
the narrow gangway between the
wall and the benches toward the
platform he seemed at a glance
sober sober and vicious his eyes were hard
his thin lips twisted into a sneer there

was a look of determination in his face
four of the toughest deck hands of the
mizen bead followed him grinning

  mr simpson who had been sitting in
an armchair by the platform jumped to his
feet

  sit down men sit down at once

  sit down yourself said bull mulligan

  theres a song just begun

  liar said mulligan its just ended

  he pushed mr simpson roughly to one
side strode on to the platform seized the
pianist by the collar and jerked him off his
stool

  the singer ducked as though afraid of a
clout on the head and scuttled away

  the audience continued to yell and stamp
their feet

  bull mulligan bowed and tapped his
chest

  now im in charge djer see you
know me bull mulligan champion heavy-
weight of the atlantic champion heavy-
weight of the pacific what i ses goesl
were goin to have a proper concert now
with fireworks to end up with this here
simpson person-he waved his hand to-
ward mr simpson who stood beside him
white-faced and agitated yet trying still to
smile-this here simpson is a washout
he turned his head and snarled simpson
if you paw me that way ill take you down
to the harbor an drown you shut up you
louse

  the second engineer of the mizen bead
had made up his mind whatever happened
to say nothing to do nothing what busi-
ness was it of his hed tried to tackle
mulligan twice and hed failed why try
again but now urged by some strange
emotion impossible to define afraid for one
agonized moment that little simpson would
burst into tears he rose to his feet

  mulligan he called abandoning dis-
cretion what the blazes do you mean com-
ing here like this you-swine

  mulligan glared at him with an expres-
sion of what seemed blank amazement 

  thought id taught you not to  inter-
fere with me you want to join simpson
here in a swim eh

  mr simpson said

  im not going to have you spoiling
everything mulligan  its not right he
spoke quietly but there was a note of
firmness in his voice that made mr cooper
wonder its not fair on us its not fair on


adventure

yourself youre doing evil in the sight of
the lord

  what else he said was lost in the sud-
den crash of discords as mulligan banged
both hands down hard on the keys of the
piano

  from all over the large room there came
yells

  get busy mulligan

  aint there goin to be- no coffee an
buns

  some one in one of the back rows of
benches hurled a book that skimmed mr
simpsons head another book followed
and burst an electric light bulb

  its a -shame said the second

engineer

  almost wish now i hadnt come said
mr mears hadnt you better sit down
mr cooper its not safe these fellers
carrying on like this-not safe at all
then why the-dont you do some-
thing to try and stop them said mr
cooper youre big enough arent you
no business of mine said the second
mate

  mulligan had climbed down from the
platform

  here you cooper or whatever you call
yourself heres where you get yours in
earnest im sick an tired o seein you
and im sick and tired of seeing youl
said mr cooper think im afraid of you
you big lump

  mulligan showed his teeth in a wide grin
listen will yer he said youll pay
for that you will you may pretend you
aint scared but you are sos he heres
another uiats goin to pay he thrust
mr cooper out of his way and planted him-
self in front of the second mate youre
scared too aint yer mears

  the second mate licked his lips and said
nothing he seemed suddenly incapable of
movement

  mulligan tore the hat off his head and
tossed it into the center of the room where
sailors fought for it

  stand up he ordered stand up
djer hear

  mr mears obeyed

  mulligan smacked his face with his open
palm

  thats for you lick-spitue

  mr mears blinked

  you lemme alone mulligan ive done
nothing to you have i

  youve done nothing havent yer
oh aint yer

  mulligan smacked him with his other
hand hard mr mears whimpered
lemme alone he said

  mulligan laughed and smacked him once
more

  the noise was so great it was impossible
to hear what was being said all over the
room men were yelling and screaming with
laughter men in the front rows of benches
were standing the men at the back yelled
for them to sit down and themselves stood
on benches to see while men who had been
standing at the back of the room in the first
place cursed these in their turn for block-
ing their view a bench toppled over and
fell two men began to fight and pummel
each other with their fists and all the
while little mr simpson white-faced sad
still trying to smile appealed for quiet and
mulligan the deck hand kept smacking
the second mates face first with one hand
and then with the other and begging him
to put his fists up like a man

  but the second mate looking dazed and
sick his plump cheeks purple made no ef-
fort either to defend himself or to attack

  mr cooper felt a profound disgust rise
up and choke him and this was the man
whod boasted what he would do to mulli-
gan this was the man whod said that
mulligan wouldnt dare do to him what hed
done to the mate

  and then he was aware of the mate him-
self speaking to mulligan

thats enough mulligan youd
better go back on board ship

as though the second mate was
now of no importance mulligan
rounded on the mate belligerently 
its come to a show-down at last has it
it has said uie mate go back on
board

  you talk a lot o rot dont you for a
grown man mulligan threw back his
head and roared all the while surveying the
mate through half-closed eyes

  the noise had died down once more
there was an almost breathless silence

  im going to knock you down said
mulligan with my fists

  are you said the mate i think not
the little chaplain said in a kind of me-
chanical way

  wait on the lord be of good courage
the miracle of the mission



  mulligan said the mate what bene-
fit will it be to either of us if we fight eh
it wont be a fight itll be a bloody slaugh-
ter again mulligan laughed seems like
ive struck heaven an a crowd o preach-
ers - what a ship can you beat it

the second engineer the second mate an
you all together why didnt they sign on
a bunch o real men for officers instead of
pickin up a pack o wet-nurses in trousers
will you take a lickin or not

  the mate shook his head

  what good will that do be sensible
mulligan where will that lead us
youre a coward mister thats what
you are there aint a man in the port o
san asensio but dont know you yeller
clarke they call yer make no mistake
if you dont clear out o this room in ten
seconds ill throw you out and then like
a referee in the ring he began to count
loudly clearly raising and lowering his arm
at each number-

  one two three four-

  there was a tense silence in the big room
feet shuffled but no one spoke

  the mate smiled

  nine said mulligan ten an out you
go sharp

  the mate held up his hand as mulligan
advanced on him

  right lets cut the fooling well
fight

  he began to take off his jacket

  mulligan waved his arms in the air and
screamed

  hes goin to fight listen will yer
bys hes goin to fight yeller clarkes
goin to fight

  go on bull knock the stuffin out o
the stiff

  rounds said the mate

  whats the good o you talkin o rounds
said mulligan you wont last moren
three seconds one punch an youre done
im champion i am i tell you one punch

have your-rounds if it pleases you-

three minutes each

  two minutes said the mate im
not as young as i used to be

  two minutes said mulligan dont
cry about it then one roundll be all you
need one punch down an out an then
you get thrown into the harbor along of old
gig-lamps an the second engineer

  well have a referee said the mate
  wholl ref shouted mulligan

 a yell from perhaps a dozen men an-
 swered him

 i will

 better let me said a quiet voice i
 understand it

 mr cooper turned and saw the elderly
 stout red-faced man who had spoken to the
 mate the night before in the plaza de san
 juan by the colonnade of the palace of
 justice

 there came a shout from the mizen
 heads cook

 why thats the earl how are yer my
 lord

 the stout man snapped at him-
 thatll do hold your tongue
 mulligan grunted

 aint you a friend o clarkes

 youll say mister when you speak
 mulligan do you hear said the mate
 some one called

 hell give the decision against yer bull
 sure as fate mind what youre doin

 it was this warning that more than any-
 thing mr cooper knew made bull mulli-
 gan agree that the stout red-faced man
 should be referee

 what the-are you yelpin about

 he said give the decision against your
 grandmother how can he there wont
 be no decision knockout in two punches
 thats me

 what about a timekeeper said the
 stout man

 mr simpson pink in the face his eyes
 gleaming behind his thick glasses worried
 undoubtedly yet with the bearing and de-
 meanor of a man who has faith in himself
 stepped forward

 its against all my principles he said
 to have anything to do with fighting in
 any shape or form but as im in charge
 here i think-i think it would be only right
 for me if i may put it like that to hold the
 watch

 bull mulligan eyed him sourly

 do as you - well please he said

 it aint important anyway seein theres
 goin to be but the one round hold twenty
 watches if you want to anything

 gloves said the stout man with a
 little smile what about gloves are
 there any

 bare knuckles said mulligan bare
 knuckles or nothin

 the mate nodded and glanced at the
 second engineer


adventure

  mr cooper will you be my second
please he frowned and seemed to be
looking for some one else he ignored the
second mate who stood immediately in front
of him and beckoned to the cook you
doctor youre the other

  the cook forced his way through the
crowd

  right he said im with yer listen
that guys a lord i seen him in new york
at fights an i seen him in london a lord
think i dont know him

  well i do hey where can i get a pail
o water an the loan of a towel

  the stout man was ordering the spec-
tators back

  give them room to fight gentlemen
no crowding please i want you to get
right back

  back yelled the crowd back right
back

  pushing yelling scuffling laughing the
sailors and firemen gave way till the space
between the platform and the front row of
benches was cleared

  the stout man said

  got any rope it neednt be very
thick but we must have something to mark
off the ring

  rope yelled the crowd rope
theres a rope in the kitchen store
cupboard said mr simpson will some
one fetch it

  the cook dragged up a chair

  mebbe well toss for corners mebbe we
wont this is ours till they kick us out of
it sit you down mr clarke an take it
easy till youre wanted

       the mate called to mulligan
mulligan get those heavy shoes
rlji of yours off well fight in socks
mr cooper roused himself from
a kind of daze

mr clarke he said you dont know
what youre tackling youre a lightweight
mulligans a heavy weve got to stop it
the referee turned and flashed a smile at
mr clarke

hes talking rubbish isnt he he said
hes talking rubbish said the mate
the cook uttered a yelp of astonishment
ls that straight my lord is it rub-
bish

  of course said the referee but who

the-are you calling my lord

  mr cooper spoke to the cook

  what on earth are you all talking
about

  the cook laughed and patted his shoulder
  miracles mister miracles

  mr clarke sat with his jacket tied by the
sleeves about his neck stripped to the waist
in the glare of the electric light his mahog-
any colored face seemed gray under the
deep tan he looked peakedjnd anxious
his tongue kept moistening his lips in his
eyes there was a deep anxiety

  mr cooper shivered though the heat in
the room was stifling

  the whole thing was absurd monstrous
how could a man as light as the mate hope
to avoid defeat

  i dont know about rubbish he said
heavily but im warning you mr clarke
youre taking on more than you realize
not only is mulligan heavier than you hes
younger youre forty-three hes twenty-
four its not doing yourself justice to go
into the ring with a man his age

  the mates thin features twisted into an
uneasy grin

  never you mind about me mr cooper
ive taken on something and im going
through with it

   the cook in his shirt-sleeves said
here mister you lay back in your
chair and take things easy see dont
talk rest an dont worry what mulli-
gans goin to do if what that referee ses is
true an it is true i bet youre worth
watchin

  two lengths of rope crossed the width of
the room from wall to wall two short
lengths of rope attached to these made the
ring there were no corner stakes

  the referee and he also was in his shirt
sleeves stood in the center of the open space
bounded by the ropes he raised his hands
high above his head and shouted in a deep
voice

  gentlemen unless theres some kind of
order kept therell be no fight under-
stand stop talking

and so before the biggest
crowd ever gathered together in
the mission to seamen at san
asensio mr clarke the mate of
the mizen head fought bull mulligan the
big deck hand

  the contrast in the size of the two men
was reflected in their demeanor the way they
fought their attitudes their expressions
the miracle of the mission



mulligan six inches the taller of the two
longer in reach heavier the younger by
nineteen years sober for once showed his
teeth in a grin his small eyes twinkled
he moved as one with no other thought in
his consciousness than to dash in and finish
the fight with one terrific blow the mate
seemed in comparison slow in his move-
ments almost sluggish depressed and wor-
ried desirous only of avoiding inevitable
defeat as long as possible

  from the moment the stout red-faced
referee smiling almost boyishly happily
said time mulligan rushed

  there was no finesse no preliminary spar-
ring no gauging his opponents strength and
condition the fight was his to batter
his enemy senseless to see him stretched on
the bare boards before him was it seemed
from his method of attack so easy that he
need take no precautions

  time

  he leapt from his chair light-footed and
rushed with a kind of grim ferocity he
drove his left at the head his right at the
body had either of these two savage
blows landed the fight must have ended
then and there as he had prophesied but
by some miracle of chance or luck-mr
coopers heart beats made him catch his
breath as he watched-the blows missed
the mate tilted his head in time to avoid
mulligans left he made a half turn and his
right skimmed his ribs the crowd yelled
he edged clumsily to the left mulligan
bored in without a pause brushed through
his guard and was on him jabbing half arm
blows at his body the mate obviously
scared obviously overpowered outfought
outweighed his mahogany face grim and
set grabbed the big mans arms and held
him

  leggo-you mulligan cursed him

  break away said the referee break

  they wrestled across the room he
tugged them apart

  mulligan he said dont hit in the
clinches

  mulligan flew at the mate at once
again his left missed his jaw a fraction
of an inch it seemed and the blow would
have found its mark his right brushed
the lobe of the mates left ear hard vicious
blows delivered with all his strength of
back and arm

  mr cooper shaking with excitement
crouched on the floor beside the cook

spectators also on their knees so that those
at the back could see pressed against him
he felt sick with apprehension and anxiety
at any instant the mate would be down
for the count and out-beaten only by
some miracle had he so far escaped the
punishment that must come the fight
could have but the one ending the man he
wanted to win the man who was proving
that whatever else he was he was no
coward would lose

mulligan followed him around

the ring - what a strong

- he was drink or no drink

he bored in on him slammed
hard half-arm blows at him jab jab jab
steadily gave him no rest left right left
right like a machine while all the while
the mate gave way blocked some of the
blows avoided others awkwardly and tried
in vain to hit the man whose big red fists
pounded him

  mulligans grin had vanished he was
angry the fight that should have ended
in the first ten seconds persisted mr
cooper could see from his expression that
his pride was touched this mate this
coward this yeller cur was still on his feet
he must at all costs finish him before the call
of time

  the gleam of cold fury in his small eyes
became an index to his thoughts

  he drove the mate into the corner op-
posite where mr cooper and the cook
knelt the light was in the mates face
he seemed dazzled bewildered at a loss
the dust rose in clouds the deck hand
led with his left at the body the mate
blocked the blow and tried to reach the deck
hands chin the deck hand brought his
right up at his jaw and shook him sent his
left in once more at the body broke through
his guard slammed his right at the heart
his left at his face the mate reeled back
against the ropes a man pushed him for-
ward again

  it was all over thought mr cooper all
over

  but again the miracle

  as the deck hands fierce right shot out
the mate ducked hit him in the body
and slipped past him into the centre of
the ring

  the deck hand his face grim and savage
his eyes blazing a red mark on his white
ribs wheeled


adventure

  time said mr simpson and the crowd
howled

  the mate dropped his hands to his sides
and walked to his corner steadily and sank
into the chair that the cook had thrust un-
der the rope he breathed deeply his lip
was cut and bleeding otherwise he showed
little sign of having lasted one whole round
with mulligan

  mr cooper flapped a towel vigorously to
drive a current of air into his face and hid
his despondency with an effort

  youre doing fine he said

  the cook was sponging the mates body

  couldnt be better he said you got
out the way that right o his all right didnt
you keep it up mister so far weve
managed splendid aint we youre what
i call a miracle

  how are you feeling asked mr
cooper

  not too bad said the mate hes too
heavy for me really i know

  mister said the cook he cant last
hes been boozin too hard to have much
stamina left you wait try for his wind

  neither of the three spoke again until
the referee said seconds out and then-

  time

  mind that right o his mister said the
cook an try for his wand

  once again the deck hand rushed he
seemed from his look to regard the mates
mere presence in the ring as a slight on his
powers as a fighter there must be no
further waste of time the fight must end
now the mate must be put out

  but again by some miracle of luck the
mate avoided mulligans fierce onslaught
he kept circling around just out of reach it
seemed moving his head back or to the side
once he countered with his right and was
short he hit mulligan a glancing blow on
the side of the nose blood trickled down
over his mouth mulligan hit him in the
body and they clinched once more once
more the referee dragged them apart

  fight on he said

  mulligan to all appearance bewildered
and confused his face crimson sprang hit-
ting with both fists the mate a slight
smile on his lips staggered him by a
straight arm drive with his left slid under
his arms jabbed him twice with left and
right and was out again untouched

  mr cooper banged the floor with his fists
and screeched advice which could never

have been heard in that tumult of shouting

  and by now he realized the character of
the fight had changed

  mulligan was no longer sure of himself
he was worried his nose was bleeding
he seemed reckless he had suffered pun-
ishment yet was ready to take any risks
however desperate if only he might win and
win quickly again he rushed wildly

  the mate took a hard drive on his right
shoulder gave way a step avoided another
drive by moving his head back and then as
mulligan followed up hard hit him first on
the nose then on the mouth with left and
right then on the chin with his left

  the look of anxiety of exasperation
in mulligans face became fear he was
alarmed no longer could he count on
victory no longer were the yells of ap-
plause for him only this man this de-
spised mate smaller lighter than himself
was his equal

  the mate seemd to have become another
man so changed were his methods

  mr cooper watching each movement in
delirious excitement found himself whisp-
ering

  lord but hes a fighter look at him
- just look at him

  and in a momentary lull in the shouting
the cook tugged at his arm and he heard
him shrieking-

  did you see that aint he a wonder
look at that footwork mulligan cant
touch him

  the round ended in a fierce rally with
both men standing up to each other and
punching hard and then clinching and
wrestling

  time said mr simpson

  the mate dropped his hands at once
turned and walked to his corner he
seemed no more exhausted now than at the
end of the previous round his nose was
bleeding as well as his lip on the deep
brown of his face there was a bruise on the
cheek bone the white of his lean body was
marred by red bruises yet he was from
his manner and the calm serene look in his
gray eyes no longer troubled by any doubt
but supremely confident of himself and his
ability

  mr cooper beyond speech once more
flapped his towel the cook sponged the
blood from his face and body

mister he said you got him goin i
do believe never have i seen anythin
the miracle of the mission



 like it in all my born days a miracle
 thats what it is a miracle

 seconds out said the referee

 mr cooper and the cook crawled under
 the rope

 time

 and now it was the mate who rushed
 before mulligan had left his corner he was
 on to him hitting as fiercely as the deck
 hand had hit in the first round it was
 difficult for the eye to follow his movements
 so swift was his attack

 before the mass of the spectators watch-
 ing had grasped what was happening be-
 fore mr cooper could respond to the cooks
 wild punch in his ribs mulligan was on the
 floor doubled up

 the mate stood back

 the referee began to count

 one two three-

 mulligan scrambled to his feet

 the mate rushed hit him with his left
 whipped in two hard drives with his right on
 the face

 again mulligan fell

 this time the referee counted six before
 he was on his feet

 he staggered toward the mate his face
 plastered with blood his eyes filled with
 horror and despair his lips parted in a
 snarl

 the spectators yelled incessantly

 the two men fought in a fog of dust

 mulligan was rushing again in turn like
 the bull of his nickname

 the mate met him with a straight left that
 shook him he came on once more the
 mates drawn back right shot forward
 swiftly mulligans head was jerked back
 as the fist reached his chin there was a
 crack the noise of the impact and mulli-
 gan lay on his back gazing up at the ceiling
 his body and legs twitching impotently as
 he tried to rise

 deliberately the referee counted the sec-
 onds swinging his arm up and down at each
 number

 eight nine ten

 he strode toward the mate seized his
 right wrist and held his arm up

 mr clarke mate of the mizen head
 wins

 the ropes snapped as the spectators
 swarmed into the ring

 mr cooper and the referee the cook and
 mr clarke were surrounded by a yelling
 mob

  good on yer mister good on
 yer

  deck hands and firemen of the
 mizen head tried to reach the
 mate no longer was he despised he had
 whipped bull mulligan the fighter the
 finest fighter going to sea he had smashed
 the strongest man on the pacific they
 wanted to shake hands with him and in
 their own rough fashion to show him they
 were sorry they had misjudged him had
 given trouble had made life hard for him
 to show too they were glad perhaps he
 has not done to them what he could have
 done what he had done before their eyes
 to mulligan

  get right back said the referee all
 the lot of you his round red face was
 beaming he laughed happily get back
 or therell be trouble

  the mate said

  wheres mulligan youll hurt him you

 fools

gradually the -crowd gave way the
mate walked across the ring to where mul-
ligan sat in his chair pale and exhausted
hes come to said one of his seconds
mulligan opened his eyes stared at the
mate and said-

  you licked me

  the mate nodded

  got anything to say mulligan he said
 sternly

  mulligan frowned he seemed to be
thinking

  yes mister i take it back what i said to
 you im sorry

  the mate grinned

  thats all right mulligan thats fine
 shake

  they shook hands

  mulligan said sheepishly-

  worst hidin i ever had in my life

  the mate turned away

  got my clothes he said he spoke
 curtly as though all at once he was ashamed
 of himself standing in the midst of the
 applauding admiring crowd he put on
 his shirt his collar and tie and jacket
 got my shoes he finished dressing in
 silence

  youre not going yet said mr cooper
 surely

  i am said the mate and id rather
 you didnt come with me see you later
 good night good night all

  the crowd made way for him clapping
 

adventure

 and he walked quickly looking neither to
 the left nor the right toward the door

  the spectators began to troop after him

  mr cooper sighed he wished the pate
had wanted him with him there were
questions he would like to have asked

  mulligan deserted even by his friends
was dressing he bent forward in his chair
and laced his shoes he rested his head on
his hand and seemed exhausted

  already the room was half empty

  mr simpson and the referee were talking
together by the platform the cook stood
a litue apart listening

  as mr cooper reached them he heard uie
referee say

  but werent you surprized he won
then

  no said mr simpson why should i
be

  but look at their sizes surely you
thought that man mulligan would beat
him

  friend said mr simpson from the
moment they stood up to fight from the
moment indeed mr clarke came into the
room i knew mulligan was beaten

  the referee grinned

  well youre a better judge of a man
than i thought any one not knowing the
facts could be this man mulligan you
know had a reputation in the ring a couple
of years back and would have done well if
hed been steadier and obeyed orders

  it makes no difference i knew clarke
would win the little man smiled then
and patted the stout red-faced referees
shoulder friend id something up my
sleeve as it were id something that was
better than knowledge of form or reputa-
tion id prayer

  the stout red-faced man looked bewild-
ered

  prayer

  yes i prayed that i might be helped in
my trouble mulligan had said he was go-
ing to wreck the mission i prayed that
the lord would aid me i prayed all the
time they were fighting that the lord would
give strength to the weak my prayers
were answered

  and you think said the stout red
faced man slowly thats how mr clarke
was able to win his fight

  im sure of it said mr simpson the
weaker smaller man won david and
goliath

  the red-faced man laughed rather diffi-
dently

  mr simpson i dont want to destroy
your faith in prayer or anything like that
but i think i ought to tell you that the
fight was a foregone conclusion before they
stood up in the ring together

  quite so from the ordinary point of
view mulligan should have won he didnt
though because the almighty was fighting
agaiast him

  mulligan should not have won you
dont know of course who that man was
who beat him

  mr cooper said

  the mate of the mizen head

  i daresay but he was more than that
he was the famous hammer clarke
what hammer clarke said the cook
gosh an me givin him advice
hammer clarke said the referee un-
defeated in the ring twenty years old and
the next challenger for the lightweight
championship of the world and a certain
winner and that mark you in the days
when championships were not as cheap as
they are now twenty-three years ago
that man you were watching to-night was
the finest fighter that ever stepped into the
ring he was taking a risk perhaps fight-
ing a man so much younger than himself so
much heavier but-well he had to he
asked my advice and i told him he must i
hadnt met him for twenty-three years not
since he disappeared but i knew him di-
rectly i set eyes on him last night in that
plaza de san juan im taking a trip
round the world and i reached san asen-
sio yesterday im waiting for the mail
boat

  i seen you often my lord years ago
said the cook i read in the paper youd
left england for slx months an now youre
here queer aint it

the stout red-faced mans eyes twinkled
i daresay it is queer my amiable friend
so is it queer you should call me my
lord he chuckled however lets not
argue will you smoke a cigar

  thank you my lord said the cook
ill keep it as a kind of souvenir

  theres one thing i didnt understand
said mr cooper why didnt mr clarke
challenge and win the championship

  he said if he did have to fight hed like
you to know all of you it would he said
explain things and youd understand in
penalty



his last fight he knocked his man out in the
first round-a blow over the heart i was
present at the ringside and saw it a hard
left on the point a right just over the heart
he went down for the count poor chap and
he stayed down hammer had killed him
yes nobodys fault an accident but he
never got over the shock thats the
story

  yes gentlemen ive backed a good
many boxers in my time ive seen every
fighter of note in the past forty years but no
one finer and cleaner and better than ham-
mer clarke that was his last fight the
other mans wife-she hadnt been married
above a couple of months i believe-was
almost demented she called hammer a
murderer at the inquest and told him shed
get him it was terribly hard on him he
wasnt to blame of course but he thought
he was he told the mans wife and his
mother the other mans mother that never
again would he fight or hit any one else as
long as he lived he never has he left
the ring gave up when the worlds cham-
pionship was his for the taking and disap-
peared to-nights the first time he ever
hit a man since the night he knocked the
other poor chap out and killed him and
now hes fretting because hes gone back on
his word a finer fighter never lived than
hammer clarke so you see mr simp-
son-the stout red faced man smiled-

though he beat mulligan it wasnt quite
like you thought it was was it

  but it was said mr simpson my
prayers were answered

  the stout red-faced man gave a shrug of
his shoulders and then laughed

  have it that way if you like mr
simpson but remember this you saw one
of the finest boxers in the world fighting
to-night

  mr cooper who had listened in bewilder-
ment found mr mears the second mate by
his side

  a sudden exultation swept over him he
said

  i knew the mate wasnt a coward i
said so all along

  acowardsaid the stout red-faced man
hammer clarke well tonights proved
that hes not hasnt it

  not to-night said mr cooper not
to-night but the whole of the voyage he
proved he wasnt a coward by being brave
enough to let us all think what we liked of
him rather than go back on his word and hit
mulligan

  mr simpson sighed

  the lords ways are beyond our poor
understanding maybe without my pray-
ers mr clarke wouldnt have been led to go
back on his word to-night and fight to save
me and my work

  maybe he wouldnt said mr cooper

hen the year was done in septem-
ber the month for caribou glenn
borden turned from the lost river
valley his trackless wonderland
world and journeyed south to cameron
post

  his was the north country vast and si-
lent yet teeming with the kindly creatures
of rivers lakes and forests who knew but
little of the ruthless destroying hand of
their big human brothers it was a land
of the cold of arctic winters beneath blazing
lights in the midnight skies and the steady
sunshine of long northern summer days

  on the little beaver near a runway bor-
den had cached a thousand weight of dried
caribou for the stern canadian winter

  the early hunt was completed by
canoe up a nameless river that ran toward
the pole and across a trackless wild he
traveled the grand ways of the worlds last
adventuring with the northwest police
headquarters one independent fur company
and the hudson bay company cameron
was the center of law and trade on the far-
thest fringe of the athabaska district

  young though glenn borden was men of
the borderland conceded him a wilderness
master where those less gifted in natures
secrets battled disadvantageously in the
limitless wild it was the discovery in him-
self of an unsuspected attachment for the
open and its little people hoofed monarchs
and lordly padding creatures that had led
him to purchase his remaining enlistment
time and resign from the royal northwest



police the captain at fort chipewyan
knew that the scarlet-coated watchers of the
trails had lost a wonderful scout and trailer
when borden hearkened to the call of adven-
ture in the open

   the reputation of his forest skill had fol-
lowed him into the new land far to the north-
west where the streams ran toward the
mighty mackenzie for all his rare nature
intuition he found himself still bound to the
world of men that was calling him in the
transparent days of the early autumn

  a score of men whose forest kinship was
easily distinguished by lean frames and wiry
muscles were gathered in the antlers the
one amusement place in cameron a half-
dozen card games were in progress glenn
borden was one of five players at a table
men played much in the antlers gambling
for amusement rarely for gain cameron
was far removed from the outside world and
a new face was conspicuous there to glen
borden there was one player the only
stranger in the game who impressed him
queerly

  among the visitors at the antlers who
were usually known to each other by quali-
ties that had to do with furs forest cunning
and skill with a rifle the border outlaw and
the city gunman types were noticeably ab-
sent

  borden seldom formed adverse opinions
of men hastily and was astonished to find
himself wondering if beneath the newcom-
ers suave manner he were a professional
crook a criminal or merely a card sharp
the token of the forest



  the game was not going well not that
borden greatly valued his losses the play-
ing was for amusement and the thrill of los-
ing was part of it money there were
things bigger than money most anything
in the north where single-handed skill and
individual courage counted most was bigger
than money he had repeatedly through-
out the afternoons playing detected the
stranger taking sly glances at bottom cards
and had observed the bluffing and the tricks
of the card cheat

  high cards and combinations of high
hands had a way of appearing all too fre-
quently the tricks of an ordinary gam-
bler would have evoked only disgust but
he felt vaguely that there was something
indefinably and positively criminal in the
heavy-faced stranger opposite him he
constantly anticipated crookedness in the
plays until the game for amusement became
to him a grim contest to uncover the real
character of the stranger the instinct of
the chase was strong in borden and he was
scarcely aware of the extent to which the
criminal suspect held his absorbed attention

   in the swift flight of the northern seasons
night came early illumined by a million in-
candescent candles in the sky borden had
quit the game in the afternoon under the
spell of an evil impression strangely drawn
to discover who and what the new player was

  in the beginning of the game which they
resumed he set traps to catch the player in
his cheating methods twice he had taken
the bait not in the open no one would
have guessed a deadly aversion toward
the stranger began kindling in his mind more
and more as the game progressed until he
was conscious of a warning suggestion not
to continue longer in the game another
circumstance arguing caution in the back of
his mind was the presence of a blue-barreled
gun beneath his right arm he was uncom-
fortably conscious of the feel of the gun he
was left-handed with it the free right and
trained left had more than once proved con-
fusing when confronting a law violator in
the police service

  he played on for a time keenly aware
that there were some things utterly forbid-
den on the northern frontier where straight
honesty and a wholesome regard for life
were never held lightly twice he attemp-
ted to quit the game but good sportsman-
ship and the insistence of fellow players
caused him to continue after a period of

indifferent playing he tilted his chair and
for a breath gazed at the big old-fashioned
office clock on the opposite wall the spi-
dery hands stood at eleven oclock and twen-
ty-one minutes i another nine minutes
he would quit the game it was the feel of
things he was apprehensive

  picking up the hand dealt him in an up-
ward glance over the top of the cards his
quick eye caught the bare flicker of white at
the level of the table there was a flash of
involuntary action as his right arm shot
straight across the table clattering a stack
of poker chips to the floor his iron hand
snapped down on the wrist of the stranger
he had seen what others in the game did not
suspect in an instant his tall form towered
above the players there was a powerful
upward surge of his arm lifting the player
clear off his seat and with a sudden twist
he shook a card from his opponents sleeve

  you are a dirty crook he held the
fellow a moment with his eyes the one
explosive accusation accompanied his side-
fling of the imprisoned hand who are
you where do you think you are

  borden straightened against the edge of
the table his eyes blazing but mastered by
a resentment and anger he did not suspect
his long right palm out remained extended
as if to ward back trouble while the left had
curved to the opening of his white caribou
blouse at his breast that practiced left
rested but inches from the blue-barreled
gun beneath his arm his incisive voice
cut the hum of voices in the room and there
was instant hush eyes centered the con-
fronting players borden did not stir so
intent was he on the figure backing away
what was his design

   he sensed the recklessness of the killer in
his malignant eyes it was the deadly qual-
ity he had confronted in the mad eyes of a
charging grizzly

   one two three four five even-spaced
the ticks of the big office clock on the
wall sounded the half seconds strangely dis-
tinct the backward-gliding figure sud-
denly brought up against a pool table a
dozen feet away

what happened in detail no
two of the onlookers would have
agreed upon particulars in the
clipped action escaped slow vision
possibly the two actors alone knew and one
of them would never tell borden saw the


adventure

hand of the stranger reaching swiftly be-
hind him but so sensitive to the move-
ment of that reaching hand was his own
practised left that at the opening of the
caribou jacket the arm of the stranger did
not flash up with a gun

  with the sharp pang of bordens gun the
thick figure against the pool table jerked
back from the hips as if he had received a
heavy blow in the face his right hand
jerked up then relaxed and a billiard ball
thudded heavily to the floor and rolled be-
neath the pool table a scarlet stream
spurted straight out from his throat at the
opening of his shirt collar he stood un-
certainly then by degrees slumped forward
bending lower and lower and without fall-
ing finally sprawled on the floor

  in the spell holding every man borden
drew back his repelling right hand he
gazed in amazement at the gun in his left
and yet he was clearly aware that there was
nothing unusual in the spontaneous flash of
the gun to his thought of danger often he
had killed game that way shooting instinc-
tively before the gun touched his shoulder
it was the automatic shot known to all ex-
perienced hunters

  a wave of unutterable regret swept him
he peered from the gun to the spread figure
beyond the card table breathing quietly the
breath coming and going more and more
slowly every instant with little catches be-
tween yes he recognized the lapsing in-
take and tired releases checked frequently
by long sighs much like a stricken deer
the man was going time without number
he had watched life going that way it was
astounding that every movement of that
swift-approaching quietness was only the
repetition of the departing life of all crea-
tures

  death in the north was no trivial thing
where men kept life often at such great odds
they had seen that is as much as unantici-
pating minds had registered they formed
no judgements not yet the shot red life
jerking out borden motionless gun in hand
and that-that which had been but was not
was tableaued before them that was all

  in a few minutes a man got to his feet
from beside the dark heap he slowly
wiped his hands then more carefully rubbed
something from the fingers of his right hand

  no-no he aint got one he wasnt
heeled he awkwardly announced his
eyes rested questioningly on borden for a

moment there aint a gun on him an
he wasnt packin a knife neither

  the men in the antlers could not say
when or how glenn borden had slipped from
the place when an hour later lieutenant
bell of the royal northwest police took
charge search revealed a deck of new
cards an assortment of many things in
pockets and an unsigned letter of intro-
ductiori recommending nat kirby to the
hudsons bay company at cameron no
one knew the man or where he had come
from they discussed the queer letter of
introduction

  not a twig snapped under his soft-mocca-
sined feet there was no betraying motion
of brush or limb-his woodcraft was too
practised for that-when glenn borden at
noon the third day after faced the un-
mapped land to the north and glided from
the vicinity of cameron

  lieutenant bell and the four men in the
station had made no move they were in
no hurry to pursue him he had made sure
of that three times that morning he had
stood long screened by dark spruces at the
edge of the stumpy opening his keen see-
ing had centered about the whitewashed
hudson bay buildings and the police head-
quarters close beside

  for an hour before he had left his hiding
place he had idled the time a glance now
and then for the town amused by indian
children playing almost at his feet he
had laughed at their droll mimicry of grown-
ups and then abruptly his low laugh was as
something choking him

  was it the sudden feel of what might go
around his neck on the scaffold that too
he had carefully thought out there would
be no scaffold for borden of the northwest
country neither would there be hopeless
years smudged by a number and herded by
rifled guards it was the sickening disgust
for the raw choking in his throat how
easily he could have avoided trouble quick
as the spring of the northern puma he could
have throttled his opponent at one move

  under the spell of suspicion he had flung
death from under his arm as he would
have killed a mad charging creature for
what over a few miserable dollars but
there would be no gallows with a chill of
remorse at the thought of that unmoving
figure sprawled like a great spider on the
floor he had turned to the beckoning land

  through the full afternoon and into the

night borden held due north he easily
found his way in the while veil of light that
a big early moon cast over the land he
boiled tea at one of his old camping places
not far from the arm of a lake he ate a
few little squares of fat pemmican and rested
beside the fire keenly conscious that there
was neither indian nor another white man
in all the land who could have covered the
distance so tirelessly had he traveled in so
short a time the open land was on his side

  by a swift understanding lhe had drawn
conclusions it would be ten days possibly
three weeks before the police would make
the first move to locate him it was clear
to borden that scout ross freeman whom
he had known at fort chipewyan was the
only man of the force at cameron who could
match woodcraft with him and freeman he
knew to be on an extended mission to the
south that accounted for the inaction of
the police those first three days when he had
remained within sight of the town they
would make one try to find him before
storms and cold ruled the land if freeman
returned in time

  the rustle in the grass and undergrowth
of the little friendly folk abroad and the
splash and subdued talk of waterfowl in the
lake came to him familiarly through the
night he wondered what ross freeman
would think when told that glenn borden
was a killer-it was an ugly word-and his
man to get

  in blanket and light caribou robe he
watched the golden rim of the early moon
disappear and the stars come bright step
by step he reviewed every move he would
make during the immediate days he had
become a living coordinating part of the
land he loved find him in a million square
miles of wilderness as long as he cared
to he could live in the forest as he had be-
fore he was assured that freeman would

fail unless-unless-

  the thought was disquieting it jerked
him wide-eyed unless he should voluntarily
surrender and return to cameron to pay
down for his folly he dismissed the impos-
sible suggestion and slept

the folk of the forest were
abroad early and borden wak-
ened to the raucous tumult of a
jay inspecting him from a bough
and the chattering of a red squirrel a few
feet away making friendly overtures from

a down spruce the morning sparkled with
life and the vigor of a land where the blood
tingles to the frost-sting in the clear air

  this was his world and he thrilled to the
companionship of his surroundings im-
agination peopled the woods with many
friends and gave a thousand happy tongues
to a voiceless land in those first wakening
hours that dark impending thing he was
fleeing cast no shadow on his spacious world

  only once nearing the close of that first
full day of his flight northward was he dis-
turbed by the fatal significance of the scarlet
deed that drove the first plunderer of human
life marked by his crime into the wilder-
ness with the certainty and swiftness of
the wolf he had crossed valleys and forests
avoiding lakes and the high ridges mid-
afternoon he sighted a dark solitary pin-
nacle a sentinel peak on the crest of the
western range the impulse was only a
whim to be sure a mere fancy

  he caught his liearings for a moment from
the landmark and then plunged into the
woods ten miles out of his course in an
unknown valley he had discovered a narrow
string of lakes with great beaver ponds and
a multitude of colonies the furs of the
hidden-away valley would yield a fortune
yet he had found increasing pleasure in pro-
tecting the harmless folk of beaver city
it had not been difficult to make friends
with them he would visit these paddle-
tailed sprightly friends again just to laugh
at their antics whistle them to him and
wonder at their quick recollection of their
big man friend

  resting on the end of a broad mud-plas-
tered beaver dam after making camp near-
by borden grew strangely conscious of a
great sympathy for the queer people of the
ponds how quickly they had responded
to friendliness they should never be
trapped if he could prevent what right
had human beings to exterminate them
he detested the thought of the ruthless de-
struction of such creatures had they no
rights to life and happiness that men ought
to respect then like a clap he was smit-
ten what right indeed what right had
he a killer to moralize on the inviolability
of life he felt his own red deed staining
the clean world about him

  the pleasure of the hour was turned to
bitterness and regret the glow of friend-
liness went out he felt his crime crowding
him out of his happy world he fled into


adventure

the night traveling long and hard beneath
the burnished sky bent on purging his soul
of dark remorse he comprehended the
moods of the forest was the very land
judging him

  during the miracle days of the late north-
ern autumn he swiftly executed his carefully
thought out plans there was a cabin on
a stream to the east that ross freeman and
possibly others of the northwest force might
discover the place should appear for-
saken not vacated meanwhile he would
be far to the west and north on an unknown
rib of the range he packed equipment and
supplies to his new home high beneath a
sheltering lava cap with a sweeping outlook
upon a hundred miles of forests ridges lakes
and streams

  when he had finished his work there was
no mark of his going on moss or leaf more
than the path left by the wild geese who had
scuttled south through the autumn sky

  moose and caribou were herding the
painted hills and valleys and all life yielded
to the whispering of winter he visited
a beaver dam to examine their progress in
thickening walls and anchoring willows for
food he read other signs of the forest people
telling him that the first big cold would
come late this season

  yes freeman would have some time be-
fore the storms for the game of hide and seek
he would try to play borden knew well
every trick of man hunting freeman
would fail then in the midst of his self-
sufficiency in a single night something he
could not identify began to work in his spa-
cious land or was it in himself that the
tragic change was taking place

  for a day he busied himself about his new
dwelling in the shelter of the cliffs vainly
struggling to free himself of a sensation of
loneliness a touch of the solitude of soul that
breeds insanity in uninhabited places at
first it was an uneasiness he could not place
in all the days of his woods life the land had
wrapped him softly but now he was lonely
and every pang of the forsaken was his

  the sky became a hostile thing the very
trees seemed changed and the little crea-
tures did not speak the bigness of his
world no longer thrilled but oppressed him
he was afraid afraid of what he knew
not a thousand voices that had called him
to look upon the glory of god by night
and day were dumb there was no glory
of night and day only unendurable silence

  two days and nights he was driven to the
open every moment he felt the land was
repudiating him for his violation of life
the land was beating him one night as
he gazed upon brassy stars that refused to
shine for him that first repellent thought
came again it twisted into his mind to
remain he would return to cameron

  he began moving southward and the fol-
lowing night built a lean-to among the twist-
ed pines in the lee of the last ridge of the
range overlooking the flat lands the
nights were freezing and the dark skies
seemed frowning with the pent fury of the
first big storm long restrained

  he awoke with the dawn was it the
world of the devil or of god that he looked
out upon from the heights it was as if
the land had suddenly heard the gurgling
catching in the throat of the dying and
astounded at the empty red-stained thing
on the floor was forcing him back

  he had no eyes for the panorama where
once every form and tint had been to him
as the fine face of a friend gazing far
across the timbered valley too distant for
ordinary vision his sight came to rest upon
the merest trace of a white vapor rising
above the green of the forest

  there was no waterfall at that point in
the lost river for a time he inspected
the clinging vapor above the river then
watched it dissolve leaving a stain against
the sky that he knew to be smoke ross
freeman was there it was as if he had
seen freeman nosing the ground like a
trailing dog he began making his way
across the valley and found relief from his
sense of bitter loss and regret practising his
wonderful skill searching for marks on earth
and leaf that not even ross freeman could
conceal from him

  that night he built his fire where a single
traveler had camped he read the story of
freemans searchings through another day
of growing chill and the whine of impending
storm he wondered why freeman did not
heed the mutterings of the big storm and
seek shelter or hurry south

          the next was a day of bitter cold
sh and of swirling charging blasts
jjgam from the north beating in the tops
ff f tjie bowing trees he had fol-
lowed freeman closely from vantage points
observing his woodcraft and comprehending
the difficulties of his search there would
the token of the forest



be short time to hide from the antagonist
who would soon test the strength of life in
the open and lock up every source of food
supply

  the flashing streamers of the aurora had
dissolved and the stars were going out when
glenn borden glided into the camp of his
pursuer he knew the mood of the coming
storm there would be little time to find
shelter and prepare for a siege he kindled
the fire and for a time watched the scudding
clouds in the long cheerless dawn not un-
til day did the muffled figure in the shelter
of the lean-to stir there was a long
moment of recognition when the officer
raised on an elbow with the apparition of
his man waiting by the fire

  come come ross it looks as if we
were starting too late to get out of this
borden swept the ugly sky with a gesture
we must get to shelter before that hits us
he added

  borden read the others confusion as he
stood beyond the fire suddenly the lines of
freemans face began working he extended
his hand and gripped bordens in a clasp
that conveyed the pity and wonder he did
not voice for a moment his gaze took in
the six-foot-two of rugged form and every
line of features that had only matured in
manly strength since he had known him at
fort chipewyan

  borden borden my- man what

made you do it stammered freeman he
saw the gray creeping into bordens face
what made you i mean what made you
comc in here like this he fell silent

  i have settled it began borden if
it will do any good they can hang me kill-
ing the body whats that ijjs words
came slow suppose ross something
should suddenly die something you couldnt
do without the life of it go out it was all
mine the free country he circled an arm
toward the darkened forest and now it
is all gone no no you cant understand
no one could understand if the trees
hated the sight of you and the stars cursed
at you and you were being choked by the si-
lence and-and crushed by the bigness of
the land then you couldnt stay out here
could you i have been a killer and now
i have killed a man and-

  there borden theres no use of
that kind of talk interrupted freeman
thats crazy talk glenn that wont
do you any good

  crazy i was never more sane in my
life i was proud of what i could do in the
woods no man could find me it would
beeasy to five in the open as i have the past
three years and now it is all a wreck and
unbearable

  in the sudden blasts that flattened the
fire they went about the preparation of the
morning meal each doing the many things
of competent woodsmen

  it was like a sickness on me resumed
borden i have been within calling dis
tance three days i felt better near you
it was never like that before

  freeman was astonished at bordens
story of the ease with which he had trailed
him through the cushioned woods

   in the shelter of the lean-to against a wall
of rocks with a high wind moaning through
the forest they had their first talk of the
shooting

  i had no thought of shooting him it
happened faster than you could think you
have hunted you know how you will
shoot from the hip or your gun come to
your shoulder and not know it that s how
it happened i had been thinking all the
time that he was a gunman or something
he had got on my nerves i guess

  it looks bad glenn he wasnt armed
not even a knife on him

  thats the queer part of it i thought
he was going to draw it is sure strange
that he wasnt armed

  what do you mean by strange why
should a man pack a gun or a knife about
town

  it was just the feel of things borden
shrugged i cant help but feel that it was
strange that he wasnt armed he threw
out a protesting palm there was cold
murder in his eyes thats all i know

  he cut his staccatoed sentences search-
ing the malignant sky he recognized the
pause in the air the crouching gathering
might before the rush of the blizzard

  you were going light borden glanced
significantly at freemans scraps of food
too light the blizzard will catch us it
may take weeks for a big early storm to
blow itself out  figured that you would
turn south or go on a hunt the first day i
struck your trail i havent enough to keep
us more than a few days

didnt think it would strike so soon
freemans permanent cache was a hun-
dred miles south at big portage he had


adventure

planned to back-track at once depending
on small game as he traveled

  they set swiftly about the construction
of a strong lean-to of poles and logs against
the rocks where freeman had made his shel-
ter for the night they had no illusions
about the frozen wrath that would soon
search the land it was a hundred yards
to the timber and there was fuel to be
dragged up while freeman scoured the
vicinity for dry wood borden hunted along
the foot of the ridge in the gale and through
the timber in a vain attempt to add even a
rabbit to their scanty supply of food every
sign of life seemed to have vanished

  the great bear and the flashing borealis
went out that night and an enormous vio-
lence took possession and began flinging
things about powdery snow particles
filled the air to suffocation the lean-to
only partly excluded the driving frost that
bit into their lungs with every breath the
fire was the object of their unremitting care
thirty-six hours was an unbroken night-
mare repeatedly bordens instinct of
direction and experience saved them from
freezing and from being buried in the drifts
that swept and piled about them they
fought every moment with the elements
their bodies demanding added fuel in the
contest

  on the fourth night the peak of the storm
seemed smiting them there were a million
snapping crashing cries of distress from the
forest and then the storm lulled for a time
once borden speculated on the chance of
reaching his caribou cache on the little
beaver but the venture seemed suicidal in
the morning the blizzard descended again
the frighlfulness of its mood somewhat mod-
erated they knew that white death for
the forest creatures would soon stalk in the
land

  in the succeeding days with hunger gnaw-
ing his vitals borden opened more and more
of his inner life his fine world of living im-
agination and ross freeman glimpsed his
humaneness toward all living things

three desolate days without
food freeman had been compelled
to remain most of the time in his
blankets the fellowship of suf-
fering drew them close borden had con-
structed a crude pair of webs and in the
steady roar of the storm bellowing down
from the ridge came staggering in with a

dry spruce his face was blistered and eye-
lids frosted together

  well have days of it no sign of a let-
up he replied to freemans usual inquiry

  theres a thing ive got to say began
freeman might as well say it now may-
be i cant after a while youll be here
when i am gone if this dont moderate im
feeling sick its the cold or something
it sounds foolish to talk this way but the
storm is getting into my bones and i feel
shaky inside and theres another thing
worrying me

  he did not look up

  whats the trouble well stick her
through borden dashed the frost from his
reddened eyes come through of course
we will just cheer up thats the thing to
do ross you dont know what a tough
old beast i have gotten to be i could
starve for a month like a wolf and then be
strong to hunt a bit of meat when the storm
quits dont worry thats the worst
thing you can do worry

  he was wholly unconscious of anything
heroic in forcing the largest share of food
even the last crumbs upon freeman giving
him his untiring strength and superb cour-
age and compelling him to remain in his
blankets while he struggled in the screaming
blasts to supply their fire

  not that glenn there are other things
bigger than just living if this is the last
camp its all right i have been in the north
too long to be afraid of going out it is you
and your trouble

  borden comprehended

  you have got your duty to the law and
a bigger duty to yourself dont worry
about me and ross if the blizzard doesnt
show signs of quitting tonight i have a plan
that may pull us through if i can work it
i have thought it out i dont under-
stand what you mean when you call your-
self a killer you have saved my life i
would have gone in the storm if you hadnt
come in you know that and now i
couldnt make one trip out there for wood
let somebody else go in to cameron with
you i wont how can i

   it is fine to say all that but i havent an
alibi i had no business to be carrying a
gun it came to me plain enough that af-
ternoon not to keep a gun on me

  you must go away glenn if we ever
get through this go away theyll hang
you and that will be another killing
the token of the forest



oh im sick of the whole business ill
never help lead a man like you to the gal-
lows law or no law his hollow eyes
gleamed beseechingly at his astonished com-
panion god knows that there are few
enough men who care for the beauty of the
woods or for gods creatures or for men or
anything but greed and getting i cant do
it he was pleading youd die right
here to save me and-and me going in there
to help hang you i cant do that

  after a while borden spoke

  i hate the thought of taking life but it
has come too late it is the thought of
shooting things its the kill idea that
makes men do it we think kill and then
some time a man just does it it has caught
me now and i am going to pay he lis-
tened a space to the full rage of the storm
pounding beyond the angle of the rocks
there is no other way even the woods
wont have me

  when darkness shut in with cold and
starvation the hour of a mighy fight was on
them borden remained steadfast in his
purpose to return to cameron and freeman
dismayed by conflicting emotions pleaded
with him to go away as soon as possible
freeman kept the fire the first part of that
night he was weak and ill and slept fitfully
while borden stood watch after midnight

  along toward morning freeman was
aroused by the piercing cold it was black
in the lean-to and the fire had burned to
coals stumbling toward the fire in a mo-
ment he realized that he was alone surely
borden could not have gone far it was
death out there in the path of the storm

  an hour after daybreak when borden
had not returned freeman began shouting
his name into the storm but as the day ad-
vanced he was possessed with the thought
that borden might have sensed the end of
the storm and had left he suffered less
from hunger but was compelled to fight off
a growing drowsiness that would have meant
quick death

  by the third day after bordens disap-
pearance he was too weakened to trust him-
self a moment in the clutch of the wind he
was digging out limbs from the heap of wood
borden had provided when he was startled
by a dull shout and glenn borden like a
great snow genie came plunging and sliding
down the piles of snow on his webs to the
entrance of the camp

  his face was grotesque in a halo of frost

and ice that had gathered on the wolf tail
about the parka hood peeling out of a full
pack alternately beating the frost out of his
garments and wringing freemans hand he
voiced his gladness at finding him safe it
was but moments until freeman dazed by
the cold and half famished was gulping hot
tea and tearing at a piece of dried whitefish
like a starving malemiut

  it was fifty miles to bordens cache on the
little beaver freeman had witnessed
marvelous feats of woodcraft and endurance
from chipewyan to the hudson bay and
knew the brave stories of undertakings
through storms when the hunger wolf
stalked in the land but this exploit left
him dumb with no sun to guide by day
or stars in the twenty hours of blackness
that was night borden hunger-weakened
had fought the blizzard without harm but
more astonishing if possible than his
heroic combat his instinct of direction
and the swift swing of his powerful legs
was the new spirit that was in him

  in some inscrutable way he had been born
anew in the storm he had gone out dis-
couraged the taking of a fellow mans life
on him like the spot of death he had re-
turned in the strength of his love of his won-
derland world

  it was a great fight and all the land was
on my side

  there was no mistaking the exultant ring
in his voice he recounted how the steady
gale had carried him true on his course and
how the freak cross-currents had helped him
on the return

  isnt it great

  he swung an arm toward the storm-flayed
forest

  why what what is great you dont
mean that freeman shuddered at the
twisting hissing storm it is raging hell
and it nearly got us great

  yes the storm it is great like a moun-
tain like the sea it is might like the
sweep of worlds through the sky and ross
listen it is my friend again i went out
afraid do you know what it is to have
fear every moment washing the red out of
your blood every drop of the red fear
driving hope and all the man out of you
as you slept i went into the storm afraid
to face my mistake like a man i was going
back because the land wouldnt have me

  out in the storm i made a promise it
was a thing i have thought of often but it


adventure

came to me clear and i received a token it
is the token of the forest and i am going
back because i will to go back i believe
that whatever happens at cameron will be
right

 he read incredulity in freemans face

  my friend a strange tiling happened to
me out there i know that it sounds queer
but it is what the forest would have me do
and i promised i ought never to have left
cameron a man cant run away from
himself when we are there ill tell you
all of it

he was tired very tired he
thawed frozen spots on his cheeks
with snow and then slept eighteen
hours freeman kept the fire
hourly replenishing his wasted strength with
small quantities of dried meat and black tea

  it was midnight of the fourth day after
bordens return when the sky cleared and
the stars came eagerly out theaurora
green fire-opal crimson burst into a thou-
sand penciled ligh ts in the sky the sudden
hush over the land startled the prisoners in
the lean-to

  in the morning they faced two hundred
miles of frozen wilderness the great storm
had swept the snow into heaps and where
the forest was thick it lay light and deep
once after an empty hour before leaving
the camp freeman spoke again

  glenn you havent a chance not the
shred of a chance in the courts i think you
know it and i wonder if you care some-
times i believe you are a bit off with this
talk about the storm and the woods may-
be the storm did help you god only knows
i cant see it perhaps men do hear voices
but i think they are only listening to them-
selves you came and gave me back my
life i can understand that

  borden stood fastening his parka at the
throat they were ready to start

  i have come to see some things clear as a
dream ross i have been an eager killer
i know the feel of killing the passion to
take life

  he held his smoking breath

  what are you saying the other
stood aghast is that the reason you came
north

  killing my hands red killing in my
eyes in my heart i know the feel he con-
tinued just to destroy that most wonder-
ful of all things life

   it was the self accusation of a strong fear-
less mind rather than the confession of a
conscience-cursed criminal

  i am going to take what is coming
to me

  for a day the whiplash of a storm hit
them and they laid over at big portage a
hundred miles from cameron

  living things began moving everywhere
from time to time they read the story of
tragedy in the snow overtaking the crea-
ture-people of the forest in the strife of the
storm beady eyes alone betrayed ptarmi-
gan on the snow caribou and moose were
a dull gray or were so rimmed with frost
that they appeared great ghosts down the
forest aisles

  they reached the out-fringe of civilization
following for miles the shadow of a single
sled trail made before the storm

  it was beyond noon when they rounded
a point in the timber on the frozen trail and
saw mirage-like against the green band of
the forest beyond squares of log houses the
hudson bay factory and the piercing flag-
pole before the royal police headquarters
their first impression of human life and
activity

  borden halted as if the sight of the tall
mast had born in on him a vision of prison
walls or that other strangling shuddering
thing his keen gaze swept the limitless
freedom to the north which he was leaving
possibly for the last time and then he re-
sumed the short gliding swing of the north-
ern trailer

  the silence of the grave lay on the post as
they entered trappers were on their lines
and the trailers were abroad again it was
a frozen day when even the malemiuts
curled in the snow only lifted their heads
sending up smoking breaths as borden and
freeman passed then quickly tucked their
frosty muzzles beneath their great wolf
tails

  they found lieutenant bell in his quar-
ters the big early storm had been the most
disastrous in his experience in the north
country and he was relieved at their escape
there was something more than a formal
welcome in the lieutenants sympathetic at-
titude toward borden he ordered hot tea
the norths ambrosia for all gala occasions
and explained that he was preparing to send
indian trailers into the northwest country
for them

  they had whipped the ice from their
the token of the forest



garments the lieutenant recounting the big
storms toll of life

  there is no use making so much of it
borden protested when freeman had de-
scribed his voluntary and timely appearance
at the camp that had saved him from the
blizzard and bordens wonderful fight
through the storm to keep them from
starving

  i am not expecting any favors for what
i couldnt help but do its no credit to me
that i am here a man doesnt know what
he might do when he steps too far it is
easy to think killing and to see life go out
like a lamp he ignored the officers attempt
to speak and then he does something
he can never undo it sounds foolish i
know but i did hear a voice in the storm
i gave my word and i am going to square
myself for killing--

  the lieutenant had signed him to silence

  wait interrupted the officer in an-
other day i would have had trailers search-
ing for both of you and theres the reason
he extended a long envelope toward the
wondering borden read it it came in
by the first mail team yesterday

  the document that borden unfolded bore
the impress of thfc government he read
the body of the communication it was an
offer of one thousand dollars reward for the
taking of one nat kirby alias two-spot
hogan dead or alive he was described
as a confirmed criminal and ex-convict
wanted for highway robbery and murder

  two weeks after ross freeman had been
sent north in search of borden the lieuten-
ant explained an indian had discovered two
guns a sheath knife and a thousand dollars
in currency cached in the dirt floor of the
cabin where the highwayman had been
sleeping

  i couldnt understand his being unarmed
that day was bordens single comment

  it was early night with the silvery veil of

the aurora folding and shimmering above
the white land when glenn borden and ross
freeman faced each other across the table
in freemans log cabin

  the token yes ross i am coming to
that but no man should carry a gun it
suggests shoot it means shoot it keeps
the kill idea uppermost any man knows
that nov i am more certain of the sign
the voice i will always believe that i did
hear it

  the morning i left you in the lean-to i
waited for daylight in the edge of the tim-
ber when it was light and i had traveled
down the wind less than a half mile i caught
the form of a deer through the storm he
was close a fine buck standing in the
thick shelter of a low-slung spruce before
i could think the rifle was to my face

  with the pressure of a finger the deer
would have died with a bullet through his
heart then it came a voice slow and dis-
tinct above the storm-

    you are a killer

  i glanced around there was only the
woods i felt the guilt of the damned i
was about to kill again i glanced through
the sights again we needed the meat
then the deer seemed to me to have as much
right to life as we do hunting things kill-
ing taking a life was there no other way to
live it flashed before me

  i dont know how it came about but i
promised myself the forest that beautiful
creature looking full at me unafraid that i
would never take life again it seemed that
the forest was telling me that i would win
back with food from the cache if i did not
shoot i lowered the rifle and in that mo-
ment the land was my friend again i knew
the storm would not hurt me and from that
moment i was given courage to face this ter-
rible mistake i will never kill again not
anything for me it is the token of the
forest

xr ear jldaibf

 r- i lad of eighteen has taken to
 a writing to me most appealing

a- letters-letters of a boy who has

- a great soul wakening within his

growing body he longs to be up and away
to sea having a deep taste for the open
waters and for ships he draws pictures
of ships on all his letters and draws them
well and with a pretty touch of boyish
pride writes beneath the sketches from
memory

  he has a job and one that pays well and
is not too hard work it palls him i can
understand that exceedingly well but his
parents do not nor can and he is evidently
their despair so you see that i am in
what might be a difficult position with the
lad saying that he wants a real friend

  i do not like to think of youths ardent
longings curbed provided that they be
honest longings there is too little spirit
of adventure amongst the boys i see about
me these days too many seem to wish no
more delectable life than that of serving be-
hind a counter-waiting subserviently on
their fellow men i was brought up where
most boys had some desire for piracy i
feel a severe responsibility in writing to this
lad he reads my sea-hungry verse and
my erratic tales and remembers them and
makes most delightful remarks

 i want to develop my character i
think i need it

  i would like to be very strong and
manly

  there are altogether too many leaders of
our boyhood today who do little but develop
a sissyfied form of what it pleases them to
call religion there is nothing so unselfish
as real manhood nothing more near akin
to the minds of the great prophets whose
lives were simple and whose souls coura-
geous it is a fine fact quite undeniable in
the light of my experience that there are
few if any men whose minds are not open
and indeed eager for what is really the right
thing

  i was recalling as dawn crept through my
little window this morning an evening at
sea very many years ago i was in the
springing flower of my young manhood and
excellently strong loving my limb power

and the life i led despite this latters hard-
ness and not infrequent monotony we
were bound for europe from this pacific
coast i had on the outward passage been
a bit of a young roughneck-nothing very
terrible but just a hearty curser and given
to those cheerful and unthinking blasphe-
mies that many boys and men drop into
often it was a sort of foam on lifes ale
a sign of in-held and perhaps unguided
virility

  in a foreign port i had lost a very dear
shipmate and it had a somewhat sober-
ing effect on me he like myself had al-
ways been an ordinary and healthy man i
loved him with that bright love that young
men have for one another one of the best
things on earth and a thing not much
spoken of because i believe it is one of
our most sacred and perhaps too rare
affections we had spent many and many
a long night-watch alone together beneath
the deep skies of mid-ocean he was a deal
older than i and i looked up to him wish-
ing i might have his unshakable laugh in
the face of adverse things he seemed to
glory in distress laughing at all hardship
and songfully defiant of the earths elemen-
tal wraths

  on the way homeward i toned down my
rough ways i was not converted or
any such thing but thoughtful having one
afternoon visited my pal in hospital to find
him on his knees we had never discussed
the thing called religion together i think
our talk was given more to ships seaman-
ship sea disasters and sea rescues-to dis-
cussing foreign places queer habits of hu-
manity and the ways of girls he had been
eleven years at sea i but two or three the
very things we discussed might have been
in a way described as our religion-for
mans life should be his religion his devo-
tion given boldly to it it seems to me one
needs neither church nor book nor teacher
to come near to the strange and inexpli-
cable presence of that something the pres-
ence of which all humanity is aware of to
some extent

  on the homeward run we had a man to
replace him an officer to take his place
for while he was an officer i was but an


the sea call



apprentice this fellow who replaced my
chum was i think as low-minded a man as
any i have ever met he was a short
pudgy coarse fellow brown-skinned and
hunger-eyed for anything scented with evil
he had been many years a seafaring man
perhaps following the sea because though
unaware of it her beauty influenced him
for good despite himself i do not know

  he had no morals or such trifling ones
that they did not matter as such he was
the sort of man to restrain whom laws are
made and jails are built probably nothing
else restrained him

  we became good friends for though i
did not have a great liking for him i was
always one to make friends with every im-
aginable sort of man i believe we arc too
given to choosing our friends and should
search more than is our habit into all
mens minds for every man has something
wonderful in him if we can find it noth-
ing on earth is rotten beyond repair rot-
tenness perishes allowing beauty to prosper
in its place though often it seems as though
beauty is overpowered yet i believe that
flowers will ultimately grow and hide for-
ever all dung-hills

  too many mens minds are like hot-
house plants their so-called religion a hot-
house grown product untried in the cold or
heat the wind and dust of the wide high-
ways of life in lifes great open filds a
man must have wide experience ere he is
fit to teach or to stand saying watch
me-i can show you dont you think so
ill say that life gives no man such a pre-
rogative

  id far rather have a son of mine come to
his ideal through something of lifes sin-
ning than have him grow up a dustless-
sandaled pharisee

  a few days ago a man who is looked upon
as one of americas great leaders of youth
said to me that he did not believe and that
nothing could make him believe that a man
might go down to the depths of vileness and
then come back and be just as good as
the man who had never fallen i forget
whether good was the word he used he
implied that one who had been far down
might never be in the sight of god or man
as fair and beautiful as the man who has

never befouled himself with our common
human errors

  thereby he damned his religion his god
himself and all his brother-men human-
ity will win against the very uttermost odds
as a hardy and valiant flower as a wind-
beaten tree that stands unflinching and
near to the divine on the edge of earths
snowline-ever endeavoring to ascend inch
and inch a little nearer to the heart of
light such a speech placed him with the
pharisees

  there are none so blind as those who at-
tribute to themselves the power and the
prerogative of judging other men are
there

  however i digress-which is a habit i
have like an old-time sailing-ship at sea

  we had been some four months or more
at sea sailing around the south american
continent and northward toward the eu-
ropean shores there was a night when
things went wrong the wind a whining
devil the sea an old black-mannered witch
the ship a shaken and distressed creature
reliant upon us to save her this little
man of the sea-ports and the sea-ways was
beside me and at something going in some
small way wrong where we toiled together
i let out a sudden string of oaths i remem-
ber the night so well the old sea-top that
rose threatening toward us and the dim
shapes of shrouds and spars above our heads
i remember too the brown face of the
sturdy little man who stared up at me his
eyes well discernible in that thickening
gloom of a stormy evening and better yet
his words

  bill he said im sorry you said that-
i bin respectin you all the voyage moren
any man aboard

  i still feel as sharp as ever the sting of
that reproach

  were i sending a son of mine to sea to-
morrow id far rather send him in the
companionship of that man who seemed
so evil than in the companionship of this
latter man who is by so many judged to
be so white-minded he would live to
dream a dream nearer to the truth for
which we are all of us seeking than would
any hapless lad led by the teachings of the
pharisee

liaisit

author of the nameless hunter plucks brokai parole etc

look on my face my name is might-have-been

i am also called no more too late farewell

rtarjhe snow was gliding down very
         silently and mysteriously impe-
         riously imposing a universal si-

- lence as if the witch of the

north had her finger on her lips and was
whispering hush while she chloroformed
the world with ice and cotton-wool

  the night was trying hard to be very
dark but could not because of the ghostly
glare of the snow yet you could not see
very far-not out beyond where the snow
reached on the mud-ooze of the estuary and
the thin glass-like ice since the tide went
out began not inland beyond the sea-
wall where the bent gnarled tamarisks
stood with their heads to the wind and their
arms held up in front of their faces not on
either hand along the snow slope of the
pebbled shore beyond

  hst listen what on earth was that

  a bark guttural hoarse full of an un-
utterable yearning came suddenly out of
the night on the lap of the icy wind and a
form long low indistinct and dark which
almost unnoticed had been silently canvass-
ing along the speckled sand of high tide line
as suddenly switched off all movement and
became as still as if the cold had all at once
stopped the action of its heart but it
was not that form which had barked

  the snow fell on and a curlew some-
where out on the mud-flats called dismally
cour-leep cour-ke as if it had heard the
sound and involuntarily got ready to fly

and to warn all other curlews hidden in the
night to get ready because of it

  then he bark came again quite close
now only just on the other or marsh side
of the sea-wall short sharp and mournful
not the bark of any dog one felt that felt
the indescribable mystery of wildness un-
derlying it

 and then something jumped up ap-
peared smudged a deeper dark against the
dark of the sky on the top of the sea-bank
and began trotting smartly up and down
whisking round at the end of its path and
returning again and again with a neatness
and a celerity that was characteristic

  and all the time the long low dark form
on the high tide line remained motionless
as if petrified and where it stood as if it
had chosen that one and only spot in the
whole scene purposely it harmonized so
exactly with the snow-mottled dark line
of seaweed that unless it moved it was en-
tirely invisible

  at last the something jumped down and
a little vagrant cloud-chased patch of moon-
light that came hurrying along the shore
caught that something and revealed it for
a moment clear as clear it-she was a
vixen

  at the same moment another something
took her place on the top of the sea-bank
and yapped and that something was
a dog fox her lover far away another
dog fox could be heard barking somewhere
on the marsh and at sound of it the first
fox snarled wickedly
the last trail



  then the vixen began nosing along high
tide line she knew that the sea who can be
generous in her gifts sometimes especially
after a storm often throws up free meals
there but this lime she found something
that she did not want for suddenly she dis-
covered herself face to face with the form
very long and low with absurdly short
sturdy legs a sinuous brown-black body
and a flat cruel head it was a polecat
the weasels and the stoats big cousin
doubtless he had been there on the same
errand as the vixen

  seeing that he was discovered the pole-
cat arched his back and bristling gibbered
viciously he did not trust foxes at any
time but foxes in love might be worse than
usual even and they were

  perhaps the vixen wanted to test her
lover perhaps she was a little above her-
self who can tell anyway with a wave
of her fine brush she crouched for attack
skirmishing as light as a rubber ball as the
polecat began to retreat towards the tama-
risks he was feeling distinctly uncomfort-
able

  next moment the dog fox joined forces
with the vixen and began leaping high in
the air as he sprang in and out snapping
and away again before you could wink
but he was dealing with one of the bravest
beasts in all the wild and at the fifth jump
he knew it

  striking as a snake strikes from an
arched loop to a flattened line the polecat
whose temper is proverbially bad at the
best of times got his bite home and when
the dog fox leapt back he took the polecat
with him pinned to his throat

   it is true that the vixens white teeth were
buried in the polecats flank but it would
take more than that to unlock the deter-
mined long beasts hold the vixen lost
her grip as the dog fox began spinning and
rolling for the polecat bites to make his
teeth meet and she never had a chance to
get it again

  without a sound something topped the
sea-bank stood staring for an instant and
then dropping on the shore side drew one
streaking reddish line towards the dog fox
it was the other dog fox he who had barked
the distant answering bark and he was not
one to waste his chances

  the polecat loosed his grip and galloped
away leaving them at it fighting like fiends
he passed the vixen on his way and she

got out of it she was several millimeters
too interested in the fight to trouble about
him and had not the slightest wish to argue
with him alone in any case

  he had gone perhaps three hundred yards
taking good care to hug the sea-bank and
line of evergreen tamarisks where were
holes and twisted root and wave-made
caves out of which no fox would care to
turn him when a noise rapidly approaching
him suspended his step twixt rise and fall
it was a mighty noise most alarming there
in that place with the magic of the snow and
the spirit of the estuary lying heavy over
all and it was an indescribable sound
the distant ruffle of drums which a king
gets on a visit a tropic rain shower on a
forest a southwest gale thundering through
an oak hangar what you will anyway
it was wonderful

  the polecat cocked one eye over his
shoulder on the line of retreat then stared
ahead with neck low

  it was dark in the sky at any rate except
when the moon flashed out like a search-
light that which came through the air
could be seen plainly it was as if a barn
was being hurled across the heavens low
down a black mass it was travelling
like the wind and with a noise like tempests
gone astray indeed it was a most amaz-
ing spectacle no wonder the polecat
cringed flattened

  in a breathless breath it was upon him
roaring whistling dazing above him over
him in another breath it was gone-
dwindling into the dark-the biggest
closest-packed flock of teal that ever you
saw the teal who of course are known as
the dandy diminutive wild duck all the
world over

if you tell a naturalist that so
many teal could fly together and
so close-packed as that-in a
huge solid mass bird almost
touching bird-he would perhaps smile
but if you told just one or two or it may
be several only old and experienced wild-
fowlers that they would not smile they
would believe for they know they have
seen it

  the polecats head shot up as the whiz-
zing rush of birds went and he listened
then he fetched round on his tail almost
treading on it it seemed and set off after
them at his odd sidelong gallop the


adventure

mighty sound of this passage had stopped
and so he argued must they

  came he soon to a low pebbly bar and a
big cove fed by an inlet through the bar
beyond the cove had many fingers and
they were rush-fringed the cove itself
was bearded with that precise marine grass
which tries to conquer most estuaries
and which not being learned i call wild
duck grass at any rate it is not zostera
marina i believe all the scene was white
and all the scene the cove the bar and
the lingers was alive crawling with teal

  it was at this point that the amazed
polecats mouth watered so much he had to
lick his ups but he lost not more than
long enough to get the geography of the
scene fixed on his brain before he got right
down to business i mean he seemed likely
to sink through the snow and vanish com-
pletely this wag because unlike some of
his relations fate does not choose to turn
polecats white in winter

  therefore his brown-black nondescript
uniform was conspicuous unless indeed he
chose to pose as a shadow of bush or grass
or whatnot and this was what he did do
with the result that somehow wonderfully
without you or i being able to notice it had
we been there without-and this was of
most importance to him-the many hun-
dreds of teal eyes noticing it that shadow
contrived to move itself one hundred and
fifty yards along that bar just below the
crest on the far side one hundred and fifty
yards to the gap where low down within
an inch of the trickling water it lay almost
among the teal without ever having given
itself away as anything more than the shad-
ow of some big stone

  then that shadow turned back again into
a polecat and shifted through half frozen
slush and water to the accompaniment of
noises like treading upon glass in less than
the tick of a second hand on a watch you
have to do that with teal even so they
did not wait they shot sprang straight up
as if fired from springs and simultaneously
the polecat only just managed to grab the
foot of one beautiful gold-spectacled red-
headed little fourteen-and-a-half-inch drake
and that only by leaping his highest possible
leap

  the death flutter of that drake-for the
polecat can slay quickly as a trained swords-
man when he likes-was drowned in the
cataclysmal roar of wings that followed and

ere it had quite dissolved high away into
the night sky he and his prey were lost
together among the reeds

  together they went from sight but not
alone as if the roar of wings-those
fastest wings of all nearly-had called it
which perhaps they had there appeared
over the edge of a dike a flat and dark
wedge-shaped head and eyes that as the
head turned gleamed anon unto the
head was added a shape long and so low
in the snow that it seemed to be gliding on
its belly it might have been the polecat
himself but it was not so fate must have
sent it for it was a polecat too and a lady
of that ilk

  one year and many months our male
polecat had sought for a wife and had not
found one polecats do not haunt every
field these days not every county one
year and some months this female polecat
had hunted the wild for a mate and never
a husband could - she find but she had
wandered far in the process far even for
restless beasts far even unto the flat and
wind-swept place at last neither knowing

  and neither knew even if she had
lifted her head above the dike five seconds
earlier she might have seen at least his tail
vanish even if he had paused just once
only to look round he might he would have
seen the glint of those eyes like wrist-
watches of soldiers who make a night at-
tack flash above the dike fate gave a
woggle to their lives and they did not
within a hundred yards of each other after
so long and neither knew

  the female shape came out and hunted
about along the inlet shore-she looked
like an ant from afar-as if she were a
hound questing then a well-marked
form low across the spotless waste she
turned away and the snow haze gradually
swallowed her up

  and even as she did so bells broke out
bells inland inland from some low marsh
church among bent gale-tormented trees
clearly beautifully through the silence
bells of the night both the beasts heard
it and stood listening with flat heads up on
long necks then the female went and the
couple that had been within a hundred
yards of each other within a hundred yards
after so long drew farther and farther apart
every instant perhaps fate laughed or
was it a red-throated diver crossing the
night sky
the last trail



  the polecat did not eat all that teal
it was his custom a bad tribal habit indeed
to nip a little and go elsewhere in defer-
ence to the snow however he took more
than that it is not quite clear whether
by the same token he like the mole and
some others was possessed of an astounding
appetite he certainly slew more than his
share as a beast about twenty-three inches
from sharp nose to bushy tail-tip

  for this reason therefore the polecat
did not reappear immediately after the meal
he cleaned first as a warrior specializing
much in subterranean warfare cleanliness
was with him more perhaps than most wild
things a religion and secondly he gained
or tried to gain some closer knowledge of a
thing unknown that ran about in the reeds
like a rat but not a rat

  this thing had ruby eyes and it was a
brown wedge when he tried to follow it
he would have sunk into the rotten ooze
if he had not learned how to throw himself
backward and if the ooze had not been
sheeted with thin ice that crackled atop
the tiling might have been a goblin by the
way it re-duplicated itself turning up behind
when it ought to have been in front and in
front when every sign proved that it must
be behind and by the way it seemed able
to run almost upon the surface of the very
water itself

at the end of half an hours
floundering the polecat discov-
ered three things firstly that
he was wet and cold-he clinked
icicles as he walked-and not so clean as
he had been secondly that he was not
nearer indeed it seemed not so near catch-
ing that thing or goblin or whatever it was
than he was at the start and thirdly that
he did not know from antediluvian relics
which was the way out of those reeds

  in another ten minutes he had more or
less got over the first problem bar the ici-
cles in another ten more by luck than
good judgment he solved the last and
the thing which was a bird name of water-
rail or officially rallus aqualicus  grunted
gibingly after him as if it were a bull frog
as he went but-and this is where the
shoe squeezed-that had given the female
polecat fifty minutes start of him at the
least and fifty minutes may be as good
as fifty hours in devious wanderings where
these beasts are concerned sometimes

  the polecat hugging the dikes and hol-
lows where the fingers of water crept inland
to the marshes maneuvered almost unseen
down to the shore of the inlet he put up
three lapwings-whose eyes must have been
miracles of keenness-which went away
complaining shrilly to all the night he
watched seven little spidery dunlin-at
least i think they were that precisc kind
of shore bird-running about on the mud-
ooze as if it were solid ground and was
deceived into mistaking them for wigeon
duck by a yodling call that they made
he crept up to a snipe running about in a
little pan of wet but the snipe had miracle
eyes like the lapwings too and dissolved
rasping into the night

  then he turned along the shore the wrong
way the way opposite to that taken by the
female it was an exasperating thing
because they were the last two living pole-
cats in that county and one felt now that
they would never meet and the race of
polecats must be doomed to die out in that
part for ever a watcher had there been
one would have been tempted to shout out

  the other way you fool the other
way

  but it was no good the idiotic beast
persisted in his course and everything
seemed all up

  and then it was that fate took a hand in
the game if it wasnt fate i do not know
what it was

  the polecat came to a grayish post
he had seen it for some time as he ambled
slowly along it had seemed almost as if
it had shone with a faintly luminous phos-
phorescence but perhaps this was fancy
anyway the wind was blowing from him
to it so he could not know the post
as is the custom of most posts-and there
were plenty - sea-washed and tottering
about-did not move at least it did not
move until he came to within about a yard
of it then it did

  he heard something whiz past his eye
and dodged if i may so put it before he
thought to it is a way they have to get
into in the wild if they desire to remain
alive acting first and thinking after then
he was two yards away i say was because
the dodge and the jump seemed to our eyes
almost simultaneous

  thereafter he turned and regarded that
post with a light in his eyes and found that
it had turned into a heron and he knew


adventure

that the whiz was made by its pointed beak
on its coiled spring of a long neck the
heron got up and flapped heavily on great
umbrella-like wings back to the place where
the polecat had come from and the polecat
after stopping apparently to think on the
miraculous escape of his eye from the
plunged assegai beak of the heron followed
it

  i fancy however that he judged the
herons observation height by his own low-
liness anyway the long-legged bird saw
him coming all the time although it did
not appear to and when he had got nearly
close enough-but it would have been
risky to tackle old friend heron anyway-
flapped away into the snowy night grating
cra-ankj cra-ankl in a voice like the
rattling of rusty dungeon chains as it went

  and the polecat struck the trail of the
lady polecat even as in his rage he made to
gallop after the great bird

  for about ten seconds he seemed to have
been struck by lightning

  then he flashed to wild excitement
running that trail with something of the
fury of an ant not mind you that he
really appeared to be following that trail
at all except in the hollows he kept about
forty yards to one side of it roughly but
that was because the invisible knives
which they called wind in those parts had
blown her scent to one side for that dis-
tance

  but there was only the high pressure
nearly bursting excitement that fairly oozed
out of that polecat at every stride to show
the amazing change that the striking of that
trail had made within him the obvious
proof of that change came when forgetting
the strict rule of hugging cover he made
to cut across the open space between one
stiffly rustling rced-choked dike and an-
other and met a man

  i wonder what he was up to there that
night of all nights

  that man was surprized when without
warning and for no reason that he could see
of course-how was he to know that he
stood bang across that magic trail barring
the way-a long low dumb dark beast
slid out of the rushes and the night and
started climbing up his leg he accused
it of trying to reach his throat which was
quite likely

  now that man had a gun of sorts a
-bore double-barrel muzzle-loader and it

was loaded but he could not fire at a beast
on his leg you see wherefore he kicked
and yelled and the beast slid down his leg
and made his teeth meet in the first thing
he could lay hold of it happened to be
the mans leg and the bites acknowledged
the fact with a howl that did more toward
frightening the polecat than any action
could have done

  next moment the man had clubbed his
gun and the polecat dropped with a thud
all consciousness knocked out of him he
came round in a second or two being only
stunned and found himself lying with his
mouth full of snow looking up at the man
skipping grotesquely ten yards away wrest-
ling apparently madly with his gun

  as a matter of fact that gun being a
muzzle-loader had taken advantage of its
owners diversion of attention for a moment
when he clubbed it to decant its caps and
without those caps or fresh ones fumbled
for in pockets with cold fingers it could not
be fired breech-loaders always do that
sort of thing-and half a dozen others-at
critical moments-as you may have noticed

it seems that animals hate to
have things pointed at them and
it is certain the loathe man to
stand still and aim perhaps it
is too suggestive of the cat tribe about to
spring anyway they become all suspi-
cion at once and mostly they remember
appointments elsewhere and so it was
with the polecat he quitted he could
not have feared the man very much or else
he would not have attacked him but all
his suspicions never very much asleep
were aroused by that attitude of aiming
and he vanished into the reeds in the snap
of a finger

  in the reeds he was rather useful because
he turned out of them quite a warm dry
bed she had made against the storm a
hare the man had found his caps by that
time and the polecat knew it the
thundering report that followed and the
squeal of the hare that followed that told
the polecat the facts and sent him the best
part of a quarter of a mile almost without
stopping but he held the trail more or less
all the same

  when the polecat did stop it was because
he had to caution was needed the
trail had led him to a farm one of those
long low crouched thatched collections
the last trail



of buildings that mark the marshland farm
where wind is always the prevailing factor
in life and shelter there is none

  the polecat did not much approve of
meddling with mans works a long and
bitter experience had taught him to stick
to the wilds and the wilder the wilds the
better but just then he would do any-
thing to please a lady nevertheless there
was no need to be a fool over the job and
his caution became extreme

  selecting the moment of a wild and roar-
ing snow flurry he peered through the lower
rails of the yard-gate and nearly dropped
in his tracks where he stood for a cream-
coloured beast hunched squat and gnome-
like was dancing it seemed with a snow-
devil by the icicle-festooned water trough
that beast was only a rat in fact but in
that scene with his slit ears stump-tail
and mange-patched hide he looked some-
thing much worse than is conveyed merely
by the word rat moreover there was
nothing in the polecats experience to pre-
pare him for cream-colored rats

  now the trail of mrs polecat led to the
water trough many trails lead to the lit-
tle unfrozen water to be found on such a
night wherefore the polecat held to his
way flat to the snow pressed into it almost

  as be slid between the lower gate bars
the polecat was aware of three noises at
once snatches as it were of sound in the
infernal dry howl of the wind one was
the resonant pealing of church bells again
and then another peal of laughter in the
farmhouse back behind the farm buildings
round the yard and the other the click of
the lowest bar of the gate which was loose

  he cursed that lowest bar of the gate
for the rat spun instantly on its stump tail
and sat hunched still silent and at atten-
tion perhaps that old rat knew that bar
clicked they are cunning enough for
anything

  the polecat froze in his tracks peering
through the falling snow and in a second or
two the rat gave three hops and was no-
where that is a way rats have but it
savors of magic all the same black magic
and evil

  the polecat crept on to the water-trough
sniffed where the rat had been making sure
that it was really a rat and not a gnome
in spite of its strange color and the lower
bar of the gate clicked

  the polecat did not spin about top

fashion as the lesser beast had done per-
haps because he was so long he darted his
head round and looked over the dark brown
curve of his own arched back one foot
he had in the air at the moment it remained
there except for that one screw of the
head he had not moved so much as a hair
and he found himself looking at the cream
rat at least if it was not he it equally
was not any rat of a legitimate rat color
and if dilapidation counts for anything
it was the very same rat

  you a human being would have shown
surprize this citizen of the wild showed
nothing behind his dark sharp brindled
weasely countenance who knows what
he thought

  but the rat was looking at him had seen
that twisted head on the long neck there
was a pretty purply light in the eyes of the
polecat that had gleamed as he turned
the eyes of the rat shone steadily like tiny
white-hot coals in three seconds and five
hops the rat was gone

  and the polecat took no notice apparent-
ly he drank a moment and continued to
decipher that trail it took all his time
it took him too once round that yard and
into a hay bin here its maker had slain
a mouse it led him through a little hole in
a door officially intended for the use of
cats only into a great black echoing void
that was the barn the barn had been full
of corn but all having been sold and carted
away two days before it was now empty
of corn not other things

  a young rat a legitimately colored brown
one this time lay on its back on the
floor barely cold its hand-like forepaws
tightly clenched something possibly an-
other rat made scraping noises high aloft
as one who climbs under press of a great
fear laboriously to the roof the roof
it seemed had many tenants mostly awake
and as the polecat cautiously followed the
trail circling the place he came upon first
a dead wood-mouse second a nearly dead
sparrow thirdly fur fur of a great whiskers
and claws he looked up and beheld it
glaring down at him eyes eyes only
floating in space but on a beam really
the eyes of a cat

  gr-r-r-r-r-rr phtt hurr-r-rl said the
cat

  the polecat said nothing like most of
the fighting breeds he was rather a silent
person he encircled the post that ran up


adventure

  to the beam three times as the owner of the
  trail had done and as it led away showing
  that the cat had been deemed too strongly
  entrenched agreed too and followed it

    it took him down a hole of awful twistful-
  ness in the floor and here he met face to
  face a stoat coming in the stoat was a
  kind of cousin of his but that made no dif-
  ference it rarely does

    the stoat grinned a horrible grin as if
 knowing what had to happen indeed
 there was no room for anything else there
 they fought it was a nasty wicked little
 scrimmage while it lasted each flew at the
 others throat the scientific rapier thrust
 behind the base of the skull which both
 used for dealing with their prey was no
 good here do rival fishermen slay each
 other with hooks

    one might have expected the stoat to go
 down almost instantly under the direct
 frontal attack of the polecat seeing that he
 was only about half the size of the latter
 but in a nimble tribe the polecat is one of
 the least nimble and the stoat one of the
 most the result was that the polecats
 jaws closed upon a stoat that wasnt there
 so to speak and the stoats little sharp
 canines upon a polecat that was being a
 polecat and of the weasel tribe he took the
 stabs of fire that proved the fact in grim
 silence

as a rule it was the stoats
custom to hang like a spanner to
anything upon which he had got
a hold but not this time he
just bit and was out of reach before the
 polecat got in a counter stroke he did it
again and again you could not have fol-
lowed his movements they were snake-
quick you could not even have told what
he was at all bristled out to twice his size
and swearing in the intervals but the
polecat could feel what he was at and
both animals-well smelt to blazes to put
it bluntly which was a tribal trick of them
something like a battleship dissolving into
its own smoke-puff

    next instant the stoat had twisted upon
 himself and was running for his life the
 polecat hard on his heels he shot out of
 the barn and across the rick-yard into the
 hedge where he went down like a sounding
 porpoise into a rats hole not large enough
 for the polecat to follow and the polecat
 after sniffing turned away to go back to

his precious trail and was just in time to
catch a glimpse of a creamish body and a
long whippy tail vanishing round a corner
of the big straw-rick

  i	think it gave him food for reflection
for he slipped to that corner to investigate
and as he did so the death scream of the
stoat muffled and choked came to his ears
from the interior of the hole they had
got him down there then cornered and
mobbed him the ruffianly old buck rats of
the place and there must have been many
for they would never have dared to tackle
the plucky little fighter else

  again the polecat paused to reflect

there seemed to be a-of a lot of scaly-

tailed vermin hereabouts and they were
wondrous bold too it almost appeared as
if his quick animal instinct had warned him
of something sinister about the place for
he stared sharply round and for a moment
seemed half inclined to retreat the lure
of love however was too strong for him
and he took the trail again which this time
led him into the cowsheds where a great
red bull anchored and lashed like a big
ship made the noises of several grampuses
and lunged at him ponderously as he passed
down the line of mangers

  he turned to show his teeth to the giant-
which was like his cheek-and stayed to
stare amazed for looking ghostly and un-
canny in the very last of a pale washed-out
rift of moonlight a creamy colored rat was
sitting upon the crossbeams that sup-
ported the cows chains and yokes it ran
along and up into the vaulted darkness of
the roof-arch after about ten seconds but
the polecat felt that that was only because
he had seen it and that as a matter of fact
it had been watching him all the time
he did not say anything of course polecats
seldom do but as he moved on i fancy he
was thinking just about as hard as a beast
like that can think

  out of the cowsheds and into the pig-
sties the trail ran and there the polecat
stopped dead there were noises in the
darkness besides the grunting and moving
of pigs noises of grim and bitter conflict
and as the polecat drew forward step by
cautious step they grew worse but for the
life of him he could not tell where on earth
they came from weird forms heard for
the most part rather than properly seen
some dark some ghostly white flitted from
his path as he stole on or stared at him
the last trail



with eyes like gimlet-holes of light from
beams from holes and unseen fastnesses

  they were the forms of rats all the rats
of the threshed corn ricks and the barns
gathered there because starving and i give
you my word there is absolutely no knowing
what starving rats will do everything bad
for certain

  these rats however were not fighting
the polecat was puzzled the horrible
sounds of a close-fought bitter fight con-
tinued and the still more horrible ceaseless
gathering of rats in every spot where he was
not continued too

  once a rat blundered past him in the dark
badly mauled and he smelt the blood and
he slew the rat squealed as his fangs
closed behind its neck and when he looked
up he found himself surrounded everywhere
by a ring of cruel sharp gleaming eyes in
pairs but when he rushed at them they
vanished only to come back when he
stopped

  all the time the noise of that furious
fight never ceased and all the time
coming in from outside he would hear the
pealing of distant church bells man it
seemed was happy that night which was
a good deal more than he was this
business puzzled him and the unknown is
always distasteful to a wild beast if not
terrifying

  in a lonely corner he found another rat
mobbed by its fellows but taking no notice
and crooning all alone to itself in pain
its brotherly comrades melted before the
polecat as he came rippling up but the
stricken one could not face him because its
head would not lift the things neck was
broken

  again he slew swiftly and as with the
last as swiftly hid the carcase away but
as he left it he heard those eyes the living
rats to wit rush in upon it with a ghast-
ly pattering like dwarfs of hyenas they
were most undoubtedly starving and by
the same token still more undoubtedly
very dangerous and he would have given
a nights hunting to be safely out of the
place but he could not find the trail of
his beloved it stopped at the foot of a
huge old-fashioned meal bin a very giant
of meal bins and beyond that though he
had cast forward and backward and in
every direction no sniffing of his could
carry it surely the rats could not have
eaten the whole animal up banish the

thought she would have put up a fight of
fights for one thing and something surely
if only fur would have been left for another

  and still the noise of terrible combat
somewhere unseen never ceased

  it seems never to have occurred to him
up to that point to look up this appears
to be a weakness that afflicts mammals
rarely to look up a strange fact too
seeing that for many of them at any rate
their chief terror comes from above it
was the frantic scratching of claws as if
something was vainly trying to balance itself
somewhere overhead that finally forced
him to lift his head and a rat fell on
top of him from over the side of the
meal bin

  it was quite white that rat or rather
creamy except where it was red and it
was already more than half dead bitten
through the neck with two clean fang-holes
and he had no difficulty in slaying it

  but why did he slay you ask why
indeed because he was a polecat i sup-
pose which is as good an answer as any
other why do some men arm themselves
and slay for sport not always and
nature had armed the polecat and he slew
occasionally but not often i dare to think
for sport

scarcely was that rat out of
action than a second incontinent-
ly tumbled upon him from above
and was despatched with clean
precision and practised promptitude not
that it would have mattered for that rat
had already two holes through his neck

  this grisly work however warmed the
polecat up it set his excitement alight
his blood burst aflame and when a polecat
when any weasel in fact begins to get
excited to see red things of a most hectic
nature are bound to happen they forget
themselves at such times but everything
within reach gets no chance of forgetting
them

sight a most amazing sight down there on
and over and among and in the meal of the
meal bin it crawled that meal it was
alive horribly animate with things meal
colored meal smothered tilings which ex-
plained the mystery of the cream- and
biscuit- and meal-colored rats and they
reared and they fought and they rolled and
they burrowed and they sprang at and
ran round and fell back from and in
about one case in twenty got up over
the side

  and they gibbered with hate and fear
and they squealed with loathing and pain
and they screamed in rage and death
and not all those things though all were
the same mealy color were rats either
one was not a rat it looked like a fer-
ret a big one parti-colored meal-colored
where it wasnt dark-brown black and dark
brown-black where it wasnt crimson

  it was fighting for its life that thing
having got in and getting no leisure to climb
out of that death-trap so were the rats
having got in and in the majority of cases
not being able to get out of that place
but even if the polecat had had his eyes
shut he would have known the name of
that other beast anybody who had not
a cold and it would have had to be a mighty
bad one would have known the name of
that beast too

  you could smell its name it was writ-
ten almost i had said in blue on the very
air for only a polecat could stink like that
and on purpose it was indeed the un-
doubted and exclusive smell in that land
of musteta pulorius the polecat but in
one point our polecat was ahead of us his
nose told him that he could add the words
female gender to that description and the
knowledge acted upon him like the touch of
a magic hand

  with a single flying leap he arrived at the
bottom of that great big bin unannounced
and grim and as he landed he set in to
slay even among the choking clinging
clogging meal he slew and fought and fought
and slew terribly ghastlily appallingly for
he was temporarily as mad as any hatter
and blind to the world for his trailing of a
night his quest of a year and a half had
come to an end at last

  for a bit however it looked to the dull
human eye at any rate as if the end was
like to be of the wrong kind and too sweep-
ing a nature for that great big bin was lit-

  erally alive with rats-starving rats des-
perate rats cornered rats old rogue rats
big father rats cannibal rats gaunt mother
rats young k-nut rats lean flapper
rats decrepit-very few of these-hoary
old rats crippled rats one or two hobbledy-
hoy rats and yea verily one blind rat-
almost all anxious to get out nearly all
failing in the leap and very much all des-
perate beyond the last shred of fear in their
desperation

  as for the female polecat she did not
seem to be able to get out either at least
not with all those rats there she must
continuously face and fight them they
would have torn her to pieces else and she
knew it but she did not know it when
she had gone in there to kill them

  even as it was there did not seem to
have been over much sanity and no pity
inside that great meal bin which was a
pitfall no less a fact by the way which
the farmer well knew but directly the
male polecat broke his neutrality the whole
thing seemed to go clean crazy in one whirl-
ing boiling tumbling revolving whitish
cloud

  a few rats managed to get out over the
side wounded fewer dying and fewest of
all whole some fell when they dropped
some crawled away to be eaten by their
kind some rushed off in the darkness
but by far the greater number failed to
make that leap good in the recking
dark and died in the choking meal fog
like well like rats and that is darned
hard too

  in the end as a storm dies that fiendish
combat died down in the bin there and only
silence and the horrible crooning mumbling
noise of a rat hard bitten and beset in a far
corner broke the fat full complaisant
grunting of the pigs at last even that
ceased and the pigs became as silent as they
ever would be

  but no polecats appeared no polecats
ever appeared the farmer found them
next morning surrounded by dead rats
one across the other-dead some of the
rats that had faced them that night had
already tasted poison and that was enough

  but verily-

  cruel is fate who makes who mars
who ends

  and that is why there are no polecats
in that county now and why too trtere
might have been

by arthur woodward

fjriquirrel - barking driving
the nail and shooting for
beef were among the most
popular shooting pastimes
among the early frontieis-men living on
the border line of civilization in old kain-
tuck and ohio

  in squirrel-barking the marksman selected
the bit of bark underneath the animal as it
rested on trunk or branch of a tree and en-
deavored to hit the bark at such an angle
that it would kill the squirrel by the shiver-
ing of the bark and concussion rather than
a direct hit

  driving the nail was the usual means of
testing the marksmanship of a man on the
border to do this an ordinary nail was
hammered into a tree for about two-thirds
its length the distance was generally set
at forty paces or one hundred and twenty
feet powder for the charge was poured
into the hand as much as would cover a ball
being considered about the right amount for
any distance under one hundred yards
the barrel of the weapon was well cleaned
and the ball placed in a greased linen patch
sent home with vigorous strokes of a stout
hickory wiping stick provident border-
ers generally carried two wiping sticks in
case of emergency

  a fair shot was one that struck alongside
the nail a good shot one that bent it but the
man who hit the nail plumb centre was con-
sidered an excellent marksman not infre-
quently two or three nails would be needed
before half a dozen men each had one shot
apiece the winners after the indifferent
shooters had been eliminated then tried out
for high place

  in the early thirties shooting for beef was
a popular pastime these particular shoot-
ing bees were held in late summer when the
cattle were fat and the marksmen would get
the most for their money

  the usual procedure was for some man
who owned cattle and wished to dispose of
a beef at a fair price to advertise that on
such-and-such a day a first-rate beef would
be shot for

  when the appointed day came around all
of the marksmen in the neighborhood gath-
ered at the designated spot and a subscrip-
tion paper was passed around stating that
mr so-and-so offers a beef worth twenty
dollars to be shot for at twenty-five cents a
shot then each person present who de-
sired to compete would put down the amount
of shots he desired each man had his own
target marked with a cross in the centre as a
bulls eye

  the winning shot won the hide and tallow
which was considered the first choice the
next highest got his choice of the two hind
quarters the third took the remaining
hind quarter the fourth took first choice
of the front quarters the fifth the remaining
quarter the sixth man not having any
beef to choose from was allowed all of the
lead in the tree against which the targets
had been placed occasionally some good
shot would win nearly the entire beef

  in speaking of these beef shooting matches
it might be of interest to state that there was
a story current on the ohio in the early days
regarding the famous-or infamous-boat-
man mike fink who because of his re-
markable ability with a squirrel rifle was
generally barred from such affairs being
credited the best shot or bang all in the
country

  however mike didnt let the matter rest
with his exclusion his price for keeping
out of a beef shooting was the fifth quarter
as the hide and tallow was called in other
words the first prize which in turn he gener-
ally disposed of to the nearest tavern keeper
for a gallon of fiery monongahela whisky
his favorite beverage

foreword

wiiever wants merely an eulogistic story of
the glories of the ionecr life in california
must not look for it in history and whoever is too
tendcr-souled to sec any moral beauty or significance
in events that involve much foolishness drunken-
ness brutality and lust must find his innocent in-
terests satisfied elsewhere but whoever knows that
the struggle for the best things of man is a struggle
against the basest assions of man and that every
significant historical process is full of such struggles
is ready to understand the true interest of scenes
amid which civilization sometimes seemed to have
lapsed into semi-barbarism it isof course impos-
sible to read this history without occasionally feeling
a natural horror ofthe crimes that for a while were
so frequent but ones horror is itself a weakness
and must give way for the most part to a simple
realistic delight in the jovial fortitude wherewith
this new community bore the worst consequences of
its own sins and after a remarkably short time
learned to forsake the most serious of them early
california history is not for babes nor for senti-
mentalists but its manly wickedness is full of the
strength that on occasion freely converts itself
into an admirable moral heroism-california a
study of american character-by joslui royce

         in a morning in the latter part of
         january  james marshall
         who was superintending the con-

- struction of a sawmill for captain

sutter in the wooded frontier of a remote
country called california walked half idly
along the ditch of the tail-race about a
foot of water was running in the ditch
something glittering on one of the spots
laid bare by the crumbling of the bank

attracted his eyes he thought it was an
opal a stone of no particular value and
quite common

  do you know said marshall a few days
later i positively debated with myself two
or three times whether i should take the
trouble to bend my back to pick up one of
the pieces and had decided on not doing so
when farther on another glittering morsel
caught my eye i condescended to pick it
up and to my astonishment found that it
was a thin scale of what appeared to be pure
gold

  once detected gold appeared to be any-
where everywhere the workmen mor-
mons and indians in sutters employ who
had previously noticed nothing now began
to pick gold up from under their feet filling
bottles and pouches scraping dust and nug-
gets from crevices a small boy washed
out fourteen pounds of gold in two days

  what surprizes me said captain sutter
is that this country should have been
visited by so many scientific men and that
not one of them should ever have stumbled
upon these treasures that tribes of indians
have dwelt in it for centuries and yet this
gold should never have been discovered i
myself have passed the very spot above a
hundred times during the last ten years but
was just as blind as the rest of them

not only had the keen-eyed trappers
stumbled across it blindly but gold hunters
in search of gold had crossed and recrossed
this wealth without seeing what they trod
upon nearly every exploration party that
entered the state passed over this ground

v
days of 

i

an able swedish mineralogist in the employ
of the mexican government was the guest
of captain sutter and examined the gold
fields himself without seeing the gold

  something of this mysterious elusiveness
persisted after gold seekers swarmed over
the land many of them expert miners and
geologists from all parts of the world the
best of these miners and scientists accom-
plished less than the loutish and ignorant
grubbers negroes dutchmen and drunk-
en sailors were proverbially lucky but at a
time when new diggings were being found
daily and for ten years afterward not
so much as one rich discovery was made
by a man of a high education as a miner or
geologist

  james marshall was the pathetic figure
that destiny most used and misused an
odd fate seemed to invest his careless words
with charmed luck for gold hunters when
the first of the miners came rushing up so
eager to dig on the very spot where gold was
discovered that they would have scraped the
ground from under the sawmill itself mar-
shall sent them haphazardly scurrying off
this way and that as the original gold-
finder his directions were accepted oracu-
larly they followed his carelessly pointed
finger and found gold

  marshall himself not only discovered gold
at coloma but at placerville one of the
richest of all the diggings and he was or
claimed to be responsible for the discovery
of gold in australia a man named har-
graves came to marshalls sawmill one day
for lumber and being down on his luck
cursed california bitterly

  see here my friend said marshall
half amused if you dont like this country
why do you come here nobody invited
you nolxdy will cry if you take yourself
off go home and dig for gold i warrant
you i could find the stuff in australia

  the miners were quite superstitious about
marshalls opinions hargraves in great
earnestness asked-

  do you really think so

  i am sure of it said marshall

  if i thought so i would go said har-
graves broodingly

  he went he discovered gold as a re-
ward the british government gave har-
graves  pounds and the australian
government gave him  pounds

  marshall was twice nearly lynched by
miners who thought he knew where more

gold could be found and would not tell
them for he pretended to knowledge he did
not have he found gold hard to get for
himself and heavy to hold he lived poorly
and forty years later died in poverty alone
in a cabin at coloma and he was buried
there within sight of the spot where he had
casually picked from the gravel the tiny
nugget that so permeated history with its
influence as to change the course of empire
the destiny of nations

         sometime somehow the gold
woud surely have been found
lshave filled the world with its
sngbtf fever but a favoring destiny
seems to have directed its discovery at a
time most fortunate for the united states

  england france russia and the united
states knew that mexico had only a
very weak hold over the spanish cali-
fornia and all of them plotted to aquire
the territory if they had suspected gold
the furtive chess-like maneuvering of the
diplomats would probably have become a
game played with armed men

  the discovery of gold was made almost
to the day a year after the decisive battle
which during the mexican war established
the americans in california as it was
just seven days after the american flag was
raised at monterey then the capital of
california a british man-of-war arrived to
take possession of the country

  the real wealth of california was un-
suspected the united states madehardly
more than a trivial show of force and won
the territory from one small part of this
territory during the next fifteen years a
billion dollars worth of gold was taken and
into it emigrants came by the thousands
and hundreds of thousands

  at a time when the worlds supply of gold
was scarce these emigrant miners with
pick shovel pan rocker and sluices each
year turned approximately two hundred
thousand pounds of actual gold not money
but metal into the united states this
gave those states an enormous commercial
power among the nations

  captain sutter and marshall had planned
with their men to keep the discovery a
secret

  legend has it that a small boy gave a
partly filled bottle of gold dust to one of sut-
ters teamsters who at the first opportunity
undertook to see if this stuff supposed to be


adventure

gold was really worth anything by offering
it to a storekeeper in exchange for brandy
the storekeeper was agitated word got
about from mouth to ear trappers and
traders in the neighborhood set off for
coloma

  vague reports drifted through the wilder-
ness and disturbed the lassitude of the
spanish village san francisco a hundred
and fifty miles away

  the thrilling news spread far and wide
world-wide it came at a time when farm
hands in the eastern states thought them-
selves well paid with  a month for work
from daylight to dark when  a day was
a good wage for a laborer when  a
year was a fine salary or business profit
when the man worth sioooo was well off
the man with  rich the news con-
firmed by official reports and letters told
of a land free to all comers where any
man with only pick shovel and pan could
gather gold pure gold by the handful

  the military governor of california on
august   reported to washington

  a small gutter not more than a hun-
dred yards long and two or three deep
was pointed out to me as the one where two
men had a short time before obtained
 worth of gold hundreds of small
ravines are to all appearances yet un-
touched the most moderate estimate i
could obtain from men acquainted with the
subject was that upwards of  men were
working in the gold district of whom more
than one-half were indians and that from
 to  worth of gold if not
more were daily obtained no capital is
required to obtain this gold as the labor-
ing man wants nothing but his pick and
shovel and tin pan with which to dig and
wash the gravel and many frequently
pick gold out of the crevices of rocks with
their knives in pieces of from one to sue
ounces

e these reports were widely cir-
culated translated the world
over discussed and believed
sober-headed people got the
idea that california was a place where gold
could be picked up like fruit in an orchard
and from all parts of the world men broke
into a stampede for the gold fields

  steamship companies sold thousands of
tickets when they had accommodation for
hundreds only families by the thousands

took to the covered wagons and streamed out
across the plains it is said that since the
crusades there has never been such a wide-
flung pilgrimage toward one spot and all
who went hurried desperately footprints
and bowsprits from every city and port in
the world pointed toward california-a
word of arbitrary coinage taken from an
ancient spanish novel in which it appearsas
the name of a fabulous island rich in gold
and precious stones and in many parts of
europe the only maps that could be found
did indeed show california as an island

  every class and caste from every nation-
ality almost from every locality was repre-
sented in the pell-mell rush that came
trampling across the plains and in the ships
where people were jammed and crammed
often on short rations usually sleeping on
planks for berths or the deck itself for
the most part they were a hardy assertive
lot the spirit of early california ad-
venturers was so well known that many sea
captains accustomed to ruling their ships
as they pleased refused the command of
ships carrying argonauts

  no no as one captain expressed it
save me from a ship-load of yankee pas-
sengers you will find that just as soon as
they recover from their first seasickness
they will hold a mass meeting on the
quarterdeck without deigning to ask the
captains permission and prescribe rules for
the government of the ship or perhaps they
will dispose the captain altogether and put
in his place a popular sailor taken from be-
fore the mast as their idea will be to run
the vessel on democratic principles so
excuse me from the command of a california
passenger ship

  men abandoned farms stores families
and started for the mines long emigrant
trains heading for oregon where great
tracts were offered to settlers abruptly
turned southward the famed exodus of
 almost depopulated many towns and
counties from missouri eastward indians
the desert cholera destroyed thousands of
emigrants but tens of thousands pressed on
over a rail strewn with the abandoned
household goods wagons bones of cattle

  many who did not join in the first rush
were later made feverish by the sight of
prodigious nuggets brought from california
and exhibited their value being compound-
ed by an admission fee crowds mobs
gathered to gaze upon this gold gold in
days of 



lumps bigger than a mans head the
french government purchased one such
nugget disposed of it by lottery and with
the proceeds sent thousands of frenchmen
to the mines

  almost anything that would float was
fitted out on the atlantic ports to carry
gold seekers steam boats paddle-wheel-
ers nearly flat-bottomed were taken from
lakes and rivers and sent around the hojrn

  seven hundred and sixty vessels many of
them rotten tubs cleared from american
ports in  and  loaded with gold hunt-
ers and rounded the horn most of these
voyages were made in the antarctic winter
some ships lay for weeks hove-to in storms
on the roughest passage of the globe all
were over-crowded nearly all came into
san francisco with food exhausted and
pumps working but they came in a
strange benevolence attended the argo-
nauts of the cape horn route not one of the
seven hundred and sixty vessels that put
out for california was lost

  it was popularly thought that the short-
est and easiest way to california was to
cross the isthmus and take passage from
panama transportation companies en-
couraged this opinion and directed the
stampede across what was then perhaps as
deadly a locality as any on earth

  the isthmus was so fever-infested that a
clause in each life insurance contract taken
out by an emigrant stipulated that the
policy was void if the insured spent the
night at chagres the port of entry all
travellers and goods had to be transported
part way up the chagres river in small
boats then packed by mules into panama
it seemed to be always raining there were
no hotels en route there was little food ex-
cepting such as emigrants carried with them
men slept in wet blankets on the wet
ground and died like sick dogs those
that lived did not always pause to bury the
dead

  the emigrants piled up in a restless
gambling quarreling mob at panama with
every man eager for the steamers that came
infrequently and which when they did come
could not begin to carry all the passengers
that held tickets many impatient to
reach california before all the nuggets were
picked over put to sea in small boats
others turned back disgusted and homesick
toward the states great numbers their
money exhausted by the expenses and

pleasures of panama were stranded and
could neither go on nor turn back like
flies in winter men died but from all over
the world other men swarmed to the
isthmus

san francisco was but little
more than a spanish village of
adobe bricks with a growth of
ramshackle buildings at the edge
of the bay where the few american traders
that dealt chiefly in hides and tallow re-
ceived and stored goods from ships that
discharged cargoes at improvised wharfs
and on the mud flats

  in the summer of  san francisco had
gone helter-skelter to the mines the
newspaper suspended editor and printer
had gone for gold store keepers shut up
shop tacking on the door the scrawl
gone to the mines the butchers the
bakers the candlestick-makers all went
the city was empty deserted when the
san franciscans began to drift down from
the hills again they found that their village
had become the port of adventurers from
every nation

  ships without pilots rode over the bar of
the golden gate and some were run
aground on the mud flats crews did not
always stay to furl sails but scrambled
ashore and made off for the mines an-
other crew could not be found for no one
wanted to leave the land of gold at one
time more than five hundred vessels that
had been abandoned by their crews lay help-
lessly at anchor some ships were run
aground and used for a time as store rooms
or lodging houses the shoveling down of
the sand hills went on and the hulk of more
than one vessel that rounded the horn now
lies buried a mile from the waterfront

  every class and condition of men and
women came and continued to come all
were eager excited restless reckless they
had to be clothed fed housed outfitted
entertained

  speculators sent cargoes upon cargoes of
merchandise goods were piled in the
streets and prices varied like the numbers
of a lottery wheel and almost as rapidly
flour was sometimes a dollar a pound and
at others times flour  lb sacks of it
were dumped into the mudholes to im-
prove the street along with kitchen stoves
and bails of tea or whatever else happened
to be heavy on the market a sidewalk

was made from montgomery street to the
mail steamer office with boxes of first-class
virginia tobacco containing  lbs each
that was soon worth seventy-five cents a
pound tobacco was at pne time found to
be the cheapest material for the founda-
tion of small buildings

  everything was a gamble prices and
values whirled soared fell rose again in
the autumn of  a citizen died insolvent
to the amount of  his administrators
were delayed in settling his affairs and real
estate advanced so rapidly that less than a
year later when all his debts were paid his
heirs had a yearly income of 

  the most conservative business was in-
tensely speculative for no one knew what
ship with what cargo would come on the
morrow and when goods came there was no
place to store them so auctioas were held on
every hand simultaneously at times all
day long often at night amid the smoky
flare of torches

  tents and houses grew overnight like
mushrooms lumber was at one time more
than a dollar a foot houses were made of
dry goods boxes muslin and canvas in
hotels the partitions were of muslin rents
were incredibly high any room twenty by
sixty feet would rent for  per month
desk room at the end of a counter was a
hundred dollars a month big buildings
brought a rental of  per month
bunks on an enclosed porch brought  a
week and in lodging houses space was
chalked off on t he floors for guests

  life was intense and changing no con-
tracts were made for more than a month
buildings were rented and money loaned at
ten per cent by the month thirty days
was a san francisco year and in that time
its people lived a full round year prop-
erty often changed hands twice a day and
in three years the city was burned five times

  each time thousands of men were ruined
but the smoldering wreckage was trampled
out by other men busily rebuilding their
city larger and more splendidly the work
of permanent construction went on through
all the hurly-burly of boisterous recklessness
and extravagance hills were tumbled into
the bay the pestilential marshes were filled
wharfs were built iron buildings were put
up only to collapse more dangerously than
wooden walls under the touch of fire bricks
were brought around the horn and the cost
of building with them was at first a dollar a

brick stone was brought from china and
australia to make stores that would stand
through a conflagration but did not

  it was a helter-skelter city bursting with
crowds the streets were littered with
empty cans bottles old clothes few men
owned baggage when a new garment was
bought the old one was thrown into the
street laundry was  the dozen big and
little at a time when a gutted market offered
shirts at  the dozen it was found
cheaper and more convenient to send laun-
dry to honolulu and even to china cross-
ing the pacific ocean twee to be cleaned

  the streets saloons gambling houses
were filled night and day with picturesqi
people strangers bumped against each
other and became partners before they had
told their names on every side were
bearded miners with the clay of the hills on
them wearing bright sashes and high-topped
boots revolvers and bowie knives were as
much a part of their dress as hats

  at a time when all men were armed and
dangerous a society of young hoodlums
mostly discharged soldiers a bit fantastic
of dress calling themselves hounds ter-
rorized respectable citizens levied contri-
butions on shop-keepers and robbed foreign-
ers and often they paraded the streets sing-
ing and shouting with abandoned women on
their arms the citizens were so preoccu-
pied with the whirlwind of speculation that
for a time these same hounds declared them-
selves to be the regulators of the city

  gamblers fastidious in clean linen dressed
in black without change of expression and
never a gesture of haste unless meaning to
shoot or stab sat behind heaps of gold
taking any bet from any man at any time
there was no limit excepting the last flake
of dust that the gambler had in his bank

  spanish californians mingled everywhere
with the crowds some of them poor others
richly clothed with high-crowned glazed
sombreros short jackets of velvet overlaid
with embroidery- wide sashes scrapes rows
of gold buttons down their slashed-bottom
trousers-with drawers showing through
the slash

frenchmen chinamen ka-
nakas gaunt plainsmen with eyes
narrowed from much staring into
the western sun which they had fol-
lowed half way across the continent trap-
pers in fur caps with long rifles in their
days of 



hands indians germans englishmen
jews every type and creed and race and
caste and class lawyers merchants team-
sters soldiers sailors judges men who had
served in congress preachers-some of
whom turned card gamblers and bartenders
while others worked as laborers or preached
like prophets in the very doorways of
gambling houses

  there were men who knew their classics
as a gambler knows his cards that shined the
boots of other men li this topsy-turvy
land where each scrambled for what he
could do scholars turned laborers and
ditch-diggers became capitalists count
raousset de boulbon of filibuster fame
who prided himself on royal blood admitted
that for a time he worked as a wharf laborer
there were southern gentlemen fire-eaters
in black hats with negro body servants
gamblers of ihe tin-horn stripe harlots and
a migratory flock of sydney ducks

  an observant traveller has written that
he was attracted by a large sign french
restaurant he found the proprietor was
a mulatto from louisiana who rented his
building from a jew employed a chinaman
as cook and a young austrian as waiter
at the table an irishman a scotchman and
a welshman were eating inquiry dis-
closed that the meat for the restaurant was
furnished by a dutch butcher the veget-
ables by an italian gardener the milk by a
portuguese and that a mexican woman did
the washing such was the cosmopolitan
congestion of the city and mining camps

  newcomers flocked in from the sea and
miners swarmed down from the hills ex-
citement and wealth gave impulse to every
form of excess there were generous vir-
tues and generous follies gold poured
upon the city and was passed from hand to
hand recklessly life was cheap and mur-
ders were unpunished in the first four
years there were twelve hundred murders
and but one conviction quarrels and
fights flared up through the crowds men
were killed nightly in the gambling houses
and the play about the table scarcely paused
at times men stood in the undried blood of
those who had died and went on betting

  but mostly all men were in moods of
rollicking good-nature a lucky miner
would shake the last dust from his pouch to
hire a band to play while he called up a
crowd around a barrel of whisky set out in
the street for all comers to drink his health

all were strangers in a strange land all
were free of speech free-handed and with a
kind of mirth jeered at discomfort comic
signs were stuck in the deepest mudholes

this street is not passable not even
jackassable

though during the winter rains horses and
even men drowned in these mudholes

  for months after the rush began there
were few homes merely shacks tents bunk-
houses where men slept barren lodging
houses a score of men to the room saloons
and gambling houses were the citys rendez-
vous and these beginning in adobe build-
ings and tents within a short time grew
into great barn-like rooms or circus tents
their floors laid with rich carpets their walls
glittering with costly mirrors or oil paint-
ings mostly of nude women

  the city gathered every exotic ornament
that a ship could bring from the orient or
europe orchestras played night and day
home sweet home was a favorite mel-
ody comedians jigged and sang women
danced to the thundering clap and stamp of
women-hungry men coarse women from
the foreign slums dainty daughters of sin
dangerous leopard-like women who had
played with princes and ruined them blood-
sucking and passionately reckless women of
all the races that have among them women
of rahabs calling came into the city and
also quietly in the more secluded parts of
the city gathered the home-makers wives
who had crossed the plains women who had
brought their hearth stones around the
horn mothers of the men who were to be
the sons of california the women beau-
tiful and wanton opened houses of carnival
women pretty as the proprietors could hire

men into the throbbing uncertainties of

anothers feet for standing room a woman
was a woman and where few had virtue
none were condemned

the center of the spanish town
of yerba buena changed but
shortly before gold was discov-
ered to san francisco was as is
usual in spanish towns the world over
the plaza a vacant wind-swept sandy block


adventure

of ground where caballeros left their horses
and wagoners halted their creaking carre-
las and on which stores fronted the
plaza remained through the turbulence of
san franciscos growth and many disasters
and under the name of portsmouth square
is still lhe plaza

  here in g mingled the miners and
merchants horses mules oxen wagons
heaps of goods were crowded on the plaza
venders hawked their wares candy pea-
nuts medicine native californians in
bright trappings with little bells jingling
rode by richly dressed women proud
of themselves though all knew them for
what they were swept along among men
who respectfully made way and other
women of the same caste in long skirts
or often in male attire rode by furiously
 spirited horses

  it was here facing the plaza that wash-
ington hall a famous or infamous house
of shameless women looked brazenly at
the public institute a stones throw away
where children gathered to school and on
sundays religious service was held and
side by side nearly encircling the plaza
the best known and largest gambling
houses flourished

  one of the most luxurious of these gam-
bling houses was the magnolia

on a july noon a horseman
showing all the marks of a far
traveler rode slowly through
the dusty streets and toward
the plaza

  the midsummer wind as usual whoofed
through the streets flinging sandy dust and
straw fibers all about with gusty hands as
if too taking part in the turbulent life
of the city men bent their heads into
it as they walked turned their backs against
it as they stood bartering together oc-
casionally new-comers had their hats blown
away and awkwardly gave chase

  the horseman had the complexion of a
brown biscuit and wore a heavy sombrero
with leather thongs tied under his chin
to hold the tent-like hat the ends of a
scarf bound around his head spanish
fashion whipped at the back of his neck
his jacket was of deerskin embroidered
with a bright design and intricately his
clothes were worn dirty a pearl-handled
revolver in a greasy holster hung at his
side at his right side which was not usual

a heavy short-handled whip dangled on
his wrist and he rode a california saddle
high of horn deep of seat with wide wooden
stirrups his eyes were narrowed as pro-
tection from the driving wind and sand
and one could not see their color a rifle
was in a scabbard under his knee and a
small roll of blankets was tied to the saddle
behind him his name was hales

  as he rode to the plaza he looked about
with calm interest there were lines of
men standing in indian file reaching up
the street for more than a block for
hours the men had been standing and
moving step by step toward the post-
office windows hales let his glance fall
here and there noticing the bustle the
queer mixture of men it was all strange
but he seemed hardly curious

  a strolling vender of candy passed near
hales leaned from the saddle

  do you know hubert lee

  hes out of town up to the mines
the vender raised a bag of candy but
hales shook his head and rode on he
sat erect in the saddle and picked his way
with care guiding his horse this way and
that by a touch of the reins to avoid people
on foot there were many men on horse-
back coming and going through the streets
most of them rode recklessly hawkers
cried their wares oxen bellowed in the
distance an auctioneers gong was being
beaten calling the crowd to bargain and
bid

  a storm of riders came round a corner
five or six young men with a woman
among them and bore down the street
they wore sashes some had colored rib-
bands faced on their coats their arms
flopped and they bounced in their saddles
as they rode some held to saddle horns
they rode without skill but recklessly
and whooped-

  out o the way-were hounds hounds
are coming

  the woman rode easily at their head
she was not laughing but sat with a kind
of watchfulness they lashed her horse
from behind and lashed their own to
keep up with her she was a skilful
rider they were trying to see just how
skilful

  some of the people in the street well out
of the way cheered her they knew who
she was the city was accustomed to less
harmful mischief from the hounds as
days of 



the escort of dona elvira they could have
stormed through the magnolia itself and
been heartily cursed by only those whom
they knocked over she was the prettiest
woman in the city every one knew that
particularly dona elvira herself

  out o the way greaser a hound
yelled and deliberately guided his horse
toward hales

  hales moving at a walk did not turn
aside it sounded and looked like a bad
joke and he was not in a mood for pleas-
antry

  then jerry fletcher a princely dandy
among the hounds lifted his whip on the
gallop and struck crying as he passed
ill teach you respect for-

  the blow had fallen on the sombrero

  hales with jerk of rein wheeled his
horse and sank his spurs into the flank
the horse leaped with plunging bound on
bound hales lurched forward in his
saddle seized fletcher by the collar reined
up sharply and fletchers horse galloped
from under him the dandified hound
fell sprawling backward into the dust

  down keep down there said hales
as his horse trampled restively near the
frightened fellow who had started with
painfully jarred joints to rise

  youll step on me i thought you was
a greaser fletcher cried

  and who are you asked hales with
rising anger and deepening frown to
raise a whip on a spaniard

  i was just playin having a little
fun-honest mister

  fun and strike a spaniard with a
whip asked hales with a kind of puzzled
wrath he knew the spanish californi-
ans down lie down there and keep
down

  under the menace of hales whip fletcher
sank back into the dust and looked wildly
about for his friends

  a crowd had rushed forward and gazed
watchfully most of the men well-pleased
to see a hound in the dust they eyed
hales wondering if he knew just what he
was about in angering this bunch of dandi-
fied assassins

  now he had turned his head and was
looking toward the parly of hounds that
having with difficulty checked their horses
were coming back but they did not ride
at a gallop

  elvira rode near flanked with young

 dandies that swore valiantly but made
 no bold movements hales sat with his
 hand on his hip turned backward toward
 the handle of his revolver his sombrero
 was pushed up they could see his face
 his eyes the deliberate steadiness of his
 gaze the hounds were not distinguished
 for personal bravery they hunted in
 packs they had a pack now but there
 was that in hales bearing which did not
 encourage quarrelsomeness

   what do you mean sir cried elvira
 wrathfullv her black eyes ablaze as she
 looked intently at him njistreating one
 of my friends i wont have it

   choose your friends with more care
 then said hales he neither touched
 his hat nor bowed

   jerry she asked jerry are you
 hurt

   yes-yes-oh i am hurt he whined

   get up dont lie there

   down said hales

   jerry sank back and stared imploringly

   what do you mean sir elvira de-
 manded this is outrageous who are

 you

 she was looking closely into
 im hales face brown lean covered
 with a stubbly beard the be-
 wildering elvira was herself now
 a little bewildered

   in a city where men were humble to her
 slightest frown there was at least a new
 sensation for her in the cool poise that
 was like mystery of this man it gave
 her pleasure to torment men she was
 spoiled insatiable restless with nerves
 in her lithe body always crying for excite-
 ment-an intriguing greedy woman warm
 soft treacherous

   why sir she asked altering her tone
 a little do you insult me

   hales looked at her as if the question
 was hardly worth an answer he had a
 way of looking steadily at a person before
 speaking

   you are mistaken if the object on the
 ground is dear to you my compliments
 madam take it off wilh you

   snickers and a few guffaws broke out
 from those that stood near she glanced
 disdainfully about to her the hounds
 were hardly more than grooms they might
 be more familiar than grooms and were
 at times companions of a sort but socially


adventure

her friends were such men as col nevinson
and monsieur max of the magnolia

  sir you are insolent

  madam in all courtesy i offer you
back your-hound you see he minds
well

  an intermingling of impulses stirred her
she dreaded the edge of his tongue and this
angered her but his nearly insolent com-
posure and purely insolent boldness fas-
cinated her besides she half liked the
steadiness in his eyes that had in it not
challenge but dominance

  why she asked with sudden softening
of tone and manner are you rude to me

  she was as supple in her art as a serpent
with its body he looked at her with a
peculiar scrutiny if he knew anything
of race she was spanish or partly so

  jerry fletcher like a furtive cripple
was trying to steal off some one in the
crowd shouted hes gittin away mister
hales reined back glanced down raised
his whip with a quick lunge he leaned
far from the saddle and as the lash fell
on fletchers head a bullet passed over
the saddle

  one of the hounds on horseback sum-
moning what boldness he could had put
his hand into his pocket and waiting until
hales head was turned fired with a derrin-
ger the bullet struck an on-looker the
crowd as if the report was an explosion
that sent them tottering backward gave
way turning and stumbling to be clear of
bullets

  hales with blow of spurs and jerk of
reins wheeled his horse and straightened
up gun in hand a hubbub of panicky
cries broke out from those who thought
themselves m line of fire but he did not
shoot

  elvira herself had struck down the derrin-
ger with one blow and with the second
lashed her riding whip full into the face
of the hound who cried out in pain cov-
ered his face with an arm kicked franti-
cally at his horse and rode off as fast as he
could go the other hounds followed
him

  madam said hales loosening the
thongs under his chin and lifting his som-
brero i thank you

  she answered with flippant coolness-

  he is such a poor marksman i knew that
he would hit some one else

 then you should have been more

careful madam for i see they are helping

some poor-off

  elvira laughed softly with head high
this man interested her she was not quite
sure that he pleased her but he was in-
teresting in a way

  i would like to know your name she
said

  again the steady look before he spoke
a moments questioning stare then-

  do you know hubert lee

  hubert lee why yes she said a
little doubtfully

  hubert lee was well known though she
did not know him she knew of him
her very good friend col nevinson and
hubert lee were not friends

  where can i find out about him i am
looking for him

  oh she wondered if his interest in
lee was friendly i dont think he is here
now he is your friend she was in-
satiably curious and incurably meddlesome
cunning a schemer of purposeless little tan-
gles anything for a moments excitement
and she enjoyed the sensation of being
clever you are looking for mr lee

  he nodded

  and your name she asked amiably
  dick hales

  oh hales dick hales-hales she
repeatedly slowly lowering her lashes but
keeping her eyes on him i believe i
know that name

  on the instant hales pressed his horse
almost to her side his look was intense
he demanded in a low voice-

  if you do madam tell me where
have you heard it i will pay-

  she was faintly startled there was a
quiet angered intensity in his manner his
gaze was searching

  there was a hales she began doubt-
fully like one who makes a timid step
where there may be danger that made a
famous name for himself during the mexi-
can war-why i heard of him even in cuba
he-

  hales lifted his hand in a gesture of in-
terruption and said sharply-

  that is not it you have known of no
one else never heard the name here-
here in san francisco

  i think i have she said lying readily
yes-she watched carefully as she spoke
searching his features for something to
guide her- i know i have there was a
days of 



man-she paused-a man who called
himself hales dick hales claimed to be
the officer who-

  her cleverness missed the mark in-
terest in what she was saying went out of
his face

  any man that wants it is welcome to
the name he said indifferently

  she could tell that his thoughts were far
off not on her not on what he was saying

  he touched his sombrero with a careless
half-military salute reined his horse about
and rode on to the plaza

  hmm-am said dona elvira gazing
after him with widened eyes it isnt a man
hes looking for hales dick hales-
ah-

  she made a sharp sibilant sucking sound
between her teeth as she smiled then
resentfully she recalled that he had not
appeared to notice that she was beautiful

in the center of the plaza was
a flagpole where captain mont-
gomery had raised the american
flag three years before and given
to the plaza the name of his ship ports-
mouth encircling this pole was a rough
corral within the corral were the horses
and oxen of traders

  men gathered about and bought and
sold stock they lounged against wagons
or the fence eying cattle they chewed
tobacco whittled bargained shrewdly in
tones of drawling disinterest

  hales rode near the corral reined up
looked slowly about he said to an idling
miner-

  whos buying

  the miner rubbed the back of his hand
back and forth across his bearded mouth
eying hales then slowly turning toward a
group of men shouted-

  hey ye danged swindlin yankee hoss
thieves heres a man with a hoss to sell
gather up an he to him

  men from many sides looked up and
moving slowly with an air of boredom came
toward hales examining him first then the
horse some on second glance were a
little surprized that he was not a spaniard

  there was a spanish brand on the horse
but not one american in two hundred knew
anything of brands excepting vaguely that
spaniards put them on horses americans
were contemptuously indifferent to greasers
and their customs

   a slope-shouldered coatless fellow with
 new broad suspenders that held his home-
 spun trousers well against his ribs studied
 the horse for a moment then looked away
 took out his pocket-knife picked up a bit
 of wood began whitding and said discon-
 solately

   ye might call that a hoss i reckon
 then with head cocked to one side as he
 eyed the horse from fetlocks to ears fifty
 dollars coin

   coin wasat a premium banks made
 good money exchanging gold pieces for
 gold dust

   everything as it stands said hales
 saddle rifle bridle blankets

   an hoss inquired the miner absently
 eying the rifle

   horse too

 hundred dollars dust said a voice
 what kind o rifle inquired the miner
 holding a piece of tobacco lefore his mouth
 as if whether or not he bit into it depended
 on the answer

   st louis 

   then its a danged good one i bet

  ever kill a bear with it

   no

   would i reckon heh

   the lean coatless man who was known
 as hank said wearily-

   were buyin a hoss-not a rifle
   dont be too sure said the miner
   hundred coin said hank

   voices began rapidly one-twenty-
 forty-fifty

   one-sixty said hank and went on
 whittling

   one-eighty

   that hoss said hank whittling slowly
 and pausing between words to see how thin
 a shaving he could peel is nigh lame in
 the left fore foot hes nigh wind broke
 i bet a pretty hes got saddle sore from
 the way he twitches hes no good as a
 hoss till hes fed three months and feed
 it is high but ill give two hundred an
 not a blamed cent more

   silence followed then the bearded
 miner stooped searched about for a clean
 straw examined it studiously stuck it into
 his mouth and said with unconcern-
 two-fifty pard

   youve bought a hoss a worthless hoss
 i reckon hank answered in disgust
 throwing aside his stick and returning the
 knife to his pocket
o

adventure

  its all yourn said some one
two-fifty asked the miner staring at
hales dust

  yes

 the miner drew a heavy buckskin
pouch from his pocket and went to a wide
board on two barrels where there was gold
scales he adjusted the scales

  here some o you fellers hold your
hats against this danged wind

  men sheltered the scales against the
thievish gusts of wind and the miner poured
in dust

  wheres your bag he asked looking
up at hales who remained in the saddle

  hales drew an empty buckskin pouch
from his pocket and tossed it to the miner
it was a pouch hales had made it had
never been touched with dust

  kinda lean an underfed this here sack
all skin like one o hanks bosses

  the miner poured the dust into it drew
the strings and handed it up to hales
who threw aside the reins as he dismounted

  he stood for a momept staring at the
row of gambling houses then without a
word with spurs clattering strode directly
toward the magnolia

  behind him the miner was saying as he
removed the rifle and looked at it with
satisfaction-

  now fellers gather up gather up all
i bought was a rifle heres a hoss for
sale saddle bridle blankets you know
any hoss hank offers two hundred for is
worth five thats why i bid bove him
an this here gentlemen is one of the best
hosses in californy

  i happen as how to know gentlemen
somethin about this hoss see that there
brand to you fellers it may look like a

picture of the-with the cramps like a

feller up to sacramento said that there
is the de soler brand-somethin they call
a cross in a circle they was a string of de
soler hosses up to sacramento just before
i come down they fetched three-fifty to
four hundred now just look at this here
hoss what am i bid hank he just said
two hundred so well start off with that
he dont care nothin about this rifle hes
buying a hoss two hundred an what
hank stooped for his piece of wood and
reached for his knife cocked his head and
walked half way around the horse as though
he had never seen it before then

  fifty coin

  other voices ran up the figures and the
miner urged them on up and up

the magnolia was a wide and
very long room rather low of
ceiling partly of adobe walls
partly of rough lumber a long
marble-topped bar ran across one end
near an end of the bar was a low plat-
form that belonged to the negro or-
chestra at the rear of the room was a
glassed-in balcony the floor of the bal-
cony was scarcely higher than a rather
short mans head and if a tall man
entered the balcony apartment or of-
fice as it was called his head would strike
the ceiling monsieur max who owned
the gambling hall did not care he was
a short man

  the magnolia and other gambling houses
too looked very much like the halls of war-
like barbarians who had plundered a luxuri-
ous people filling their rude shelter with
treasures some of the tables used for
gambling were of carved teak others of
rough lumber covered with blankets vel-
vet or baize before the tables were rough
benches above some of them were glass
candelabra above others lanterns

  the noon hour was the dullest hour in
san francisco life this being the low ebb
of revelry which lasted through the night
and reawakened in the afternoon

  when hales entered there were only
two or three gamblers sitting at their tables
and about these but a few men dabbled
with small sums

  he glanced about hardly pausing and
went directly to a table where a tall pale
man with a slight tread of a scar on his
temple sat alone idly shuffling his cards
it was said that stewart dawes nevpr
slept	v

  is your game open asked hales

  dawes gave him a steady searching look
answering quietly-

  certainly sir be seated

  deal said hales and remained stand-
ing

  the gambler moved his chair an inch or
two opened the drawer of his table and
brought out several stacks of gold coin
which he arranged methodically in the
center of the table with unhurried move-
ment he drew a derringer and placed it on
the table at his elbow then shuffled the
thin spanish cards dexterously he noticed
days of 



particularly that hales kept his eyes fast-
ened on the cards

  this man is a gambler said dawes to
himself presenting the cards to be cut

  hales cut them and squeezed the two
parts of the deck into alignment then
his hand as if absently touched his revol-
ver and came to rest on his hip palm
turned backward dawes touched his
derringer moving it half an inch

  their eyes met for a moment neither
spoke dawes understood that at the
first false move he would be shot without
warning the gamblers fingers with no
more tremor than a lifeless hand would
have shown drew off the monte lay-
out

  hales saying all of it dropped his
pouch on the bottom layout playing an ace
watching the deal with frank and menacing
suspicion

  he won

  he bet everything and a few seconds later
won again

  ah you are in luck said dawes
pleasantly my congratulations

  deal said hales

  dawes was a clever gambler but a
thorough gambler rather than a courageous
man and knew when it was wise to take a
loss and to deal fairly

  without a word and with an air of calm-
ness imperturbably dawes again opened
his drawer and drew out two large bags of
gold dust

  once more said hales

  he won

  how about trying just once more
dawes asked temptingly opening his
drawer

  no but ill be back you happen
to know if hubert lee is in town

  he is not unless he came today

  hales gathered up his gold sticking the
coins into the pouch pockets of his wide
belt and squeezing the bags of gold dust
into his jacket then he turned and went
from the magnolia walking with rattle and
clatter of spur rowels

  not a shade of expression crossed dawes
cool white face he quietly opened his
drawer estimated his loss returned the
derringer to his pocket touched the hilt
of the bowie knife in a sheath under his
coat then began shuffling his cards waiting
imperturbably for the next who would
come to try what fortune offered

m

about the same hour that
hales had reached the city the
martin oday out of new york
came in packed somehow be-
tween decks there came also five hundred
and twenty-three passengers among them
were three women two of whom were young
and beautiful the women had vanished
quickly from view

  the passengers in-a sort of bewildered
flurry were brought to a rickety landing by
boatmen who charged  per head they
were greeted by a loud-mouthed urging
from hawkers and barkers showers of busi-
ness cards fell about them and here and
there was lifted the enticing cry gold
gold gold heres where you get your
gold a hundred dollars if you guess the
ace sharpers fiddled with studied clum-
siness at cards spread on barrel heads

  of more interest than passengers to the
city was the fact that the martin oday
brought a huge mirror for the magnolia

  during the afternoon this was lowered
in a web of ropes from the ship to a lighter
on which monsieur max fretted in proprie-
tory excitement a crowd there were al-
ways crowds gathered to watch the crated
mirror brought ashore

  hales passing that way paused rolled a
cornhusk cigaret and looked on without
interest

a small fellow of sparrow-like alertness

and impudent cockney cast of face jostled
hales as he rushed by to slap the back of a
man standing near

  the cockney wore a cap that settled about
his ears with visor turned up like a shabby
coronet his coat was much too large and
the sleeves were rolled back over his wrists

  as he slapped the tall young man he
cried-

  i-oh johnny tyler were ere at
larst eh matey-o the marly hodays
bloomin ooker even if she was nymed
arfter me an shipmyte ill give it to yer
stryght-miss tesler likes yer johnny
if yer wasnt the right sort of bloke id

see yer in- i would wivout tellin of yer

that she likes yer johnny stryght

  john taylor regarded the cockney with
startled embarrassment and disapproval
he was tall very erect young and self-
consciously reserved of bearing at the
first glance of his face as he turned hales
 

adventure

felt that he recognized the boy as some one
that he knew but whatever it was that
had suggested a remembrance slipped away
elusively as a vague wisp of dream-thought
does when one gropes to drag it into
view

  there is no need sir said taylor
firmly for you to address me in that man-
ner or at all sir

  the little cockney grinned with un-
ruffled friendliness

  blimeme johnny yer a lucky bloke
ow now wot the-

  the cockney dashed off to where the
stevedores were lifting the mirror and wad-
ing about in the shallow water and mud

  young taylor had not been in the city
three hours and was increasingly bewil-
dered the city was not as he had expected
he was from boston this was like the
riotous camping place of nomadic bar-
barians

  the four months on shipboard had been
difficult enough but he had managed to
keep pretty much to himself among the
crowd of passengers that pressed his elbows
and tramped about the deck that strange
foreign gentleman mr tesla and his
daughter had been almost the only ac-
quaintances that taylor had made mr
tesla was the most important passenger
he of all on board had a stateroom to
himself as well as another for his daughter
and her attendant

  this cockney had been discovered as a
stowaway the mate bringing him to the
captain had dragged him aft and thrown
him down the stairs so that he fell right at
the feet of mr tesla and his daughter who
were just coming on deck she had been
very angry at the mate and insisted upon
taking the matter up with the captain
mr tesla a little bored had offered to
pay the stowaways passage and privately
did though miss tesla demanded that the
stowaway be given passage to compensate
for such mistreatment

  whats your name the captain had
asked

  martin hoday said the cockney
instantly i thought as ow i ad the right
on a-ooker as is nymed arfter me

  miss tesla was already bored by the
tedium of ship life besides her maid a
tall wellfavored but ominous looking
spanish type of woman there was only
one other woman on board and though

this was a very agreeable and pretty young
woman with the smallest of rosebud
mouths she travelled alone and permitted
men to be attentive to her there was
no doubt as to madame renaults caste

  miss tesla would not so much as look
even disdainfully at the sinful little french
woman nor at the men who did look at
her which was why she had shown favor
to young john taylor

  in the naive impudence of the small
cockney miss tesla had found much
amusement his comments delighted her
he was as full of meddlesome tricks and
self-assurance as a monkey

  one day in perverse curiosity she asked-
dont you think the french woman is
pretty martin

   er not by arf he answered rap-
idly out of his street-bred wisdom see
er mouf no biggern a mouse ole it
aint look out for them as as a little
mouf them as as little mouves is stingy

as- -

  john taylor had grown very much at-
tached to miss tesla but he had been ap-
pallingly shocked to discover that mr
tesla was the representative of a french
syndicate that owned an interest in many
gambling houses in san francisco taylor
had thought him a gentleman a refined
quiet intelligent gentleman-and he was
a gambler

  young taylor came from a rather proud
boston family a puritan family in which
there had appeared a most distressing
strain of wayward blood his own sister
who had married a young officer the son
of a wealthy family had become a notorious
woman and until she disappeared had
seemed actually to delight in creating scan-
dal it had all developed presumably
through a weakness for drink

  my brother who some years ago went
west and took up a farm said john tay-
lor one day to mr tesla wrote that he
was going overland to california i was
ready to take my bar examination but his
letter gave me the gold fever i dont
know a person there but i have a letter to
mr hubert lee who i understand is
prominent in the country he has lived
there for many years was a trader and
hide-buyer until he made a fortune in the
gold fields

  so said mr tesla with quiet inter-
est hubert lee it must be the same
days of 



gentleman he owns an interest in the
syndicate-

  so it was that john taylor who had very
strict ideas learned that mr tesla was
the manager of a big gambling syndicate

young taylor had promised
his parents that he would avoid
evil companions that had been
difficult enough on shipboard
but san francisco appeared to be a con-
gested city of mad ruffians outlandishly
unkempt it was impossible to avoid
them on the street villainous looking
strangers all armed stopped him abruptly
and knowing that he was just off a ship
demanded the news from home

  one boisterous fellow half drunk had
pressed him against a wall saying-

  just in hey after gold hey ill
show you young feller look here hold
your hand

  the man drew a buckskin pouch opened
it and grabbing taylors hand shook out at
least a tablespoonful of golden dust

  there you are salt that in a letter to
your ma californy gold plenty more
where this come from mountains of it
i just wanted to show you

  the man laughed recklessly crammed
the pouch into his pocket and stumbled off

  taylor as yet had not taken lodgings
he had looked about but the best he could
find was a canvas bunk in a second story
room utterly bare except for tiers of such
bunks for which the proprietor bruskly de-
manded eight dollars per night

  he had decided that he would have to
take such a bunk and had returned for his
baggage which he had left in a store near
the waterfront

  the mirror was being escorted up the
street by a swarm of men the little cock-
ney ran among them busily as if helping
to superintend

  as taylor went off hales looked after
him thinking

  -something about that boy fine
clean fellow-looks out of place in this city
since hubert lee isnt in town i suppose
ill have to look for that poor woman wher-
ever i can i dont think much of lee for
not taking her-not taking care of her
since he knew who she was i shall tell
him so he could have done that as well

as write me my- i almost hope that

i dont find her

john taylor picked up his
two heavy bags and struggled
back toward the plaza they
were leaden with the veight ol
books as long as he had good looks he
would not be lonely anywhere

  he stopped to rest his arms

  near-by two men were talking one was
sharply featured with a sort of nervous
good-nature and the look of a man shrewd
at business the other was a large man
tall rotund of body massive full and round
of face his voice was deep deliberate
sonorous he carried a heavy cane with
gold knob wore a black frock coat and
when he removed his wide-brimmed soft
black hat to wipe his forehead it was dis-
closed that he was as bald as a friar with a
fringe of gray reaching from ear to ear

  he was addressed repeatedly as judge
and except for the genial repose of his
countenance a tolerant kindliness in his
bearing he might have been taken for one
who was a bit pompous particularly as he
used flowing sentences and had a rather
formal maimer of address

  i cant lose judge my rents are going
up land is doubling every three months
as i explained to you yesterday i cant lose
sir the affairs of mortals are too un-
certain for a judicial use of the words i
cant lose 

  nothing risked nothing gained judge
sir we do not win heaven by shaking
dice with the devil

  said the shrewd man of business in
rather petulant raillery

  when i get my hands full of earthly
goods ill look out for heaven i am not
a thief i have merely used the opportu-
nity that fell into my hands i havent
hid from anybody what i have done and
am doing i would have been a fool not to
use other peoples money when i got the
chance now honestly dont you think
itvorth the risk

   worth sir is a term of vague import
the things that are worth while to me sir
are sound sleep a clear head ripe digestion
i would not undergo your anxieties for ten
times the gain that you anticipate

  but judge as a lover of poetry you
know that there is a tide in the affairs of
men which taken at the flood leads on to
fortune


adventure

  ah said the judge with freshened in-
terest tapping the ground with his cane
a money-changer with the words of a poet
on his lips is alarmingly suggestive of the
devil quoting scripture return to that
same poet and learn that he has most
fittingly called this fortune a blind goddess
careening over the world on a rolling stone
sir my fortune is of such modest propor-
tions that-

i fear not loss i hope not gain

i envy none i none disdain

  no yankee wrote that cried the man
of business with satisfaction you get
that poetry nonsense out of your head
poetry sir said the judge with ami-
able composure is to the soul as wine to
the flesh it warms and enlivens and sets
aglow-

  but the man of business waved his hand
in pretended disgust in which there was
no doubt true feeling and went away
hurrying

  the judge stood for a moment in broad
good-nature watching his friend rush off
among men who also rushed then he
turned massively and noticed taylor
looked at his bags on the ground at bis
clothes looked carefully at his face

  ah young man you have not been
long in our fair city you too i take it
come with the hope that yours will be the
touch of midas turning mud and sand
into gold what do you think of our city
it seems a babel or taylor added
hardly conscious of humor a shabby
babylon

  excellent said the judge looking
more closely at him will you sir join
me in a drink

  i do not drink

  the judge regarded him with mild
surprize-

  you do not drink why not

  i think i am better off without liquor
you have studied for the-ah-minis-
try said the judge slowly kindly

  no i was reading for the bar

  a lawyer ah the judge thought-
fully looked at taylor noting him in every
detail measuring him with the penetration
of one who for thirty years has heard the
searching confession of clients studied
jurors examined witnesses you have
friends accompanying you

i came today alone i wouldnt have

come at all but my brother is coming
overland

  and you have been studying for the
bar this is fortunate there is in fact
a professional matter upon which i would
value the opinion of a younger man than
myself will you accompany me sir
come with me right with me

  the judge spoke with cordial insistence
and bending with some slight effort and a
mild grunt he took up one of taylors bags
and started on his way

  they went about a block from the plaza
and came to stairway that led up the side
of a hardware store in a frame building
it was a rickety stairs and trembled under
the massive figure of the judge

  he led the way into a room that seemed
almost bare the floor was bare there
were two plain kitchen chairs a rough
table was the desk shelves were made
of boxes and on these shelves were many
books most of them bound in heavy echre-
colored sheeps skin they looked like law
books but they were not on one wall
was a large engraved portrait of daniel
webster his frog-like jaws set in an expres-
sion of stern truculence on another wall
was a portrait of chief justice marshall
sternly ascetic and intellectually aloof
the judge whose judgement of men was
excellent thought these two of the greatest
men that had ever been born in america

  there was a lamp with a badly smoked
chimney on the table and a muslin curtain
on a wire was drawn across the room for a
partition behind which were the sleeping
quarters for the judge and a small spanish
boy

  this boy mateo was about fifteen or
sixteen with a shy girlish smile who had
lived in the city all his life knew all the his-
tory and gossip of spanish families in the
vicinity and ran errands for the judge

  sit down sir said the judge and
added a few lines of poetry to the invita-
tion he weaved poetry through his con-
versation as readily as some men interlaced
their speech with profanity

  taylor lingered a moment running his
eyes over the backs of the books for a book
lover is as bad as a drunkard and at the
sight of what charms him goes to it hun-
grily here were names which taylor
though he thought himself pretty well edu-
cated knew only by the dimmest report
rabelais hudibras a norths plutarch
days of 



old english plays a ponderous and well-
worn bible shakespeare and a very familiar
name paradise lost

  the advisors of my youth the com-
panions of my maturity said the judge
with a gesture as if really introducing
the young man to the volumes but sit
down sir

  taylor sat down wonderingly the judge
put aside his gold-headed cane and stand-
ing with hands under his coat tails bal-
anced himself now on his heels now on
his toes and looked at the young man care-
fully

esir he began with sonorous
modulation you are newly
equipped for the bar and your
brain still gleams with the whet-
ting of text books i am an old and rusty
lawyer but not too old sir not too proud of
my gray hairs to put my ears to the lips of
a younger man and sir as one counselor
to another i seek a little assistance for
which sir- he drew a heavy leather wal-
let from under his coat tail and clinked it
on the palm of his hand-i shall readily be-
stow fitting remuneration

  taylor felt confused and doubtful he
liked this strange massive gentlemen who
had an old-fashioned manner of speech and
bearing but taylor for all the quite good
opinion of himself that college and family
tradition had confirmed could hardly see
why a person of age and evident experience
would care for any legal assistance from
a young man not yet admitted to the
bar but the judge was convincing tay-
lor listened absorbedly and forgot his
doubts

  sir the gentleman with whom you saw
me conversing on the plaza is a merchandise
broker instead of refunding to certain
english merchants the money collected for
their goods which he disposed of profit-
ably he has invested it in city property
his wealth grows apace

  he makes no secret of this speculation
he points out that he has merely taken ad-
vantage of an opportunity he acknowl-
edges his debt but he is so heavily involved
that to gather in the necessary cash for a
settlement would greatly injure if not
ruin his investments the english mer-
chants are taking what feeble means they
can being so remote from this unsettled
community to recover their property he

has asked me to assume charge of his diffi-
culty and relieve him of the pressure that is
being brought to bear to compel a settle-
ment now sir what procedure do you

suggest

  that he pay what he owes said tay-
lor whose ideas of honesty were simple and
rigid

  i see i see um-hmm there is much
money involved our fees would be quite
munificent

  no he is a thief however successful
i would advise him but not defend his
theft

  the judge nodded gravely

  ah i see i see and i am reassured
i felt that perhaps i had remained too old-
fashioned and was not up to the wrinkles
and quiddities of the day but the princi-
pals of equity and honesty are eternal i
advised him sir that his defense should
begin after his restitution i am delighted
that a young attorney should confirm my
elderly judgment further more sir in
this shabby babylon-a most excellent
phrase that- there is more drawing of
deeds devises conveyances contracts
more work suitable to a clerk than a
man of my years can take pleasure in
i am wearied every day by that sort
of work and there are so many cases
of doubtful merit offered for my consid-
eration that i would value value sir
the advice and association of a young
man for whose judgment i have the great-
est respect sir i invite you to enter into
a partnership with myself

  taylor flushed with excitement and stam-
mered-

  but i am not a lawyer-yet

  sir it is of course necessary at times to
know something of law in order to be a
lawyer any numbskull sir can butt his
head against blackstone a sufficient num-
ber of times to pass a bar examination
but the great essentials of a good lawyer
sir are honesty of judgment and love of
justice to which should be added a pro-
found reverence for the poets for mark
you sir in thirty years at bar and bench i
have never known an evil man or an un-
wise man to venerate the poets who sir
are men of god as surely as were the proph-
ets of judea sir your hand we now en-
ter into partnership as the legal firm of
deering and-by the way sir what is your
name


adventure

v

that evening there was much
excitement in the magnolia the
largest mirror in california it
remained the largest for many
months too was set into the wall behind
the bar

  the proprietor of the magnolia monsieur
max no one knew that he had more of a
name than that was a short tubby fellow
with a heavy black mustache tightly
crinkled at the ends he always wore a
wide red sash diamonds glittered on his
shirt front flashed from his fingers

  the negroes on their platform blared and
tooted the crowd gaped and craned across
the bar miners stared fascinated at unfa-
miliar bearded faces they knew for their
own

  some said this mirror had cost 
others scoffed a lookin glass like that
 be reasonable sir say 
californians figures were then as now large

  it was as if the toilers of babel had gath-
ered there the great room was packed
with people moving restlessly a film of
tobacco smoke hung over their heads
nearly all voices were low-pitched mum-
bling buzzing about the gambling tables
the crowd was silent except for an occa-
sional low exclamation from those that lost
or won the faint metallic staccato of soft
clinking was heard through the hum and
drone of voices for hundreds of men shuf-
fled and toyed with gold and silver coins in
their hands

  the streets without sidewalks and un-
lighted were nearly deserted excepting
saloons and gambling houses there were no
other places of amusement unless one went
among the chilean encampment where the
lowest of women owned by men lower than
themselves aided in the robbery often the
murder of those who came to them or
among the cribs and taverns of the water-
front lonely men that did not drink and
would not gamble entered such gambling
halls as the magnolia the bella union the
el dorado the verandah and a dozen
other houses where there were bright fur-
nishings a blaze of lights carpets music
people

  ragged miners and southern gentlemen
dignified mexicans and tipsy sailors sat to-
gether on the same bench at monte tables
other men of all classes stood three and

four deep reaching across to lay their bets
a curious invisibility seemed to hide the
clothes a man wore and beards concealed
many of the faces where all men were
strangers names were unimportant

  gamblers and lookouts were at all the
tables lookouts were needed when the
play was made by so many people

  an odd thing of the -s was that
these professional gamblers of the higher
caste were in manner and in dress as much
alike as if they were a trained and cos-
tumed brotherhood their hands were
white supple slim they were unemo-
tional aloof quiet of speech at all times
drank if at all sparingly they dealt faro
and monte under the watchful eyes of dan-
gerous suspicious men they dealt with
studied slowness and with studied uncon-
cern watched the cards fall there was sel-
dom the flicker of an eyelash whatever the
gold won or lost with sinister indiffer-
ence they seemed never to notice who was
playing against them or for how much but
they dealt with a revolver and often a
bowie knife too on the table at their el-
bows

a flare of voices rose sharp
with anger the next instant a
shot was fired frightened voices
broke out then there was a mo-
ments hush and pause all through the room
and as no more shots followed some men
surged toward the scene others merely
glancing that way went on with their con-
versation some players at distant tables
did not turn their heads the orchestra
with only a discordant note or two went
on with turkey in the straw

  martin oday by headlong squirming
pressed through the crowd and emerged
before a monte table where a tall gambler
pale expressionless except for a gleam of
eye and thinner line at his thin mouth
stood with hand to derringer on the table
before him and watched a drunken miner
with a hole in his breast being helped off

  the little cockney demanded rapidly of
the men about him turning from one to
another

  wots the muss i sy wots the row
the gambler attracted by the shrill
insistence of the cockney voice glanced
toward him the gaze lingered with pene-
trative searching for a moment but the
gambler disdained to speak then casually
days of 



brushing at a glint of gold dust on his dark
sleeve reseated himself and without a
glance toward any one began shuffling the
thin spanish cards

  make your bets gentlemen make your
bets droned his companion the lookout
indifferently

  i sy martin demanded a little sub-
dued by the gamblers eyes but insistent
on knowing what it was all about and
grasping at the arm of a man near him i
sy wots the row

  this man was hubert lee tall browned
clean shaven he wore a new broadcloth
suit freshly polished boots and a sombrero
he had been in california for years as the
agent trader hide-buyer for a firm of big
leather merchants in the state

  at the first news of gold he being used
to the country and to trading with indians
had employed a large number of them
profitably until rum sellers crowded too
close to the diggings but he had made a
fortune and invested heavily in san fran-
cisco property he was one of the impor-
tant men of the city with many enemies

  alter looking the cockney up and down
with a half-suspicious scrutiny lee grinned
broadly amused

  just in eh well youngster the gen-
telman that is being escorted off with a hole
near his heart lost two huhdred ounces of
gold in about an hour then had the bad
judgment to argue with stewart dawes
the same being the man that deals this
game if this fool dies he will be the second
that mr dawes has sent to the happy hunt-
ing ground within a month

  yer mean-yer mean men is killed like
that martin cried leaving his mouth
adroop as if to catch the answer

  lee good-naturedly tapped his own re-
volver thrust into a broad leather belt that
was studded with silver pieces

  in this country each man has to look
out for himself and if hes a quarrelsome
cuss he doesnt have to wait long to get
buried have a drink youngster

  i aint quarrelsome i aint

  martin called it quarle-sm but his
meaning was dear

  the busy bartender greeted mr lee re-
spectfully by name-

  i thought you were out of the city sir
i just went to sacramento for a day
said lee came down on a little schooner
just got in about sundown

  lee tossed a buckskin pouch to the bar
the bartender with an air of preoccupied
haste for customers were waiting took a
pinch of dust between finger and thumb
which he dropped into a dish on the shelf
behind the bar

  what could be taken between finger and
thumb though one mans finger and thumb
might be larger than another passed in
those free-handed days for a dollar

  i sy mr lee is there any gold left in
this bloomin country fr some of us fellers
wots jus come in

mountains of it mr lee affirmed en-
couragingly at the same time handing the
bag to martin so that he might for a mo-
ment hold a sack of real gold feel its weight
blimey its eavy as lead

  and some of it is soft as flour said mr
lee taking back the pouch -
 ow do yer get there i come to get
there i did an im in a bloomin urry
i am

  mr lee in an amiable mood explained
that a gold hunter first went to stockton or
sacramento from where he took his depar-
ture for the mines the fare to either place
was about three ounces of gold gold was
roughly  the ounce in san francisco
less at the mines the miner must have an
outfit of shovel pick pan-pans at one
time had been  but were now down to
 or  in the early days-about six
months before-even wooden washbowls
had brought as high as  a pick was
now  one must have blankets boots-
boots were  a pair-pans grub

  a man said mr lee with the careless-
ness of one who has thousands needs about
 to outfit right its hard work you
are not very strong

  ill do martin answered with assur-
ance

  it would be best for you to have a pard-
ner you need a pardner anyhow there
are indians they pot the lone digger with
half a chance mexican bandits are begin-
ning to frequent the trails the men who
had previously lived in california and re-
spected the spanish californians always
spoke of the spanish desperadoes as mexi-
cans i know two men that washed out
 in three days with a cradle

  wats a bloomin cradle

  looks something like a babys cradle
with a sieve in the bottom shovel in dirt
pour in water rock the cradle the gold


adventure

sifts to the bottom unless you make it
yourself a cradle will cost about 
and there is gold lots of gold anybody
can find it

  at that moment a man hurried up to mr
lee saying

  ive been looking all over for you lee
mr tesla whom weve been expecting
you know came in today ready to do busi-
ness its lucky you got in tonight other
people-you can guess who-are trying to
crowd you out of the deal they are over
to the bella union monsieur max is over
there too waiting

  lee and his friend walked off hurriedly

a tipsy miner of huge size arose
from a bench at a monte table as
the gamblers lookout tossed the
markers from a heavy bag of
dust and placed the bag among the banks
heap of gold

  the burly miner with an easy almost
cheerful air of unconcern shoved his way
through the encircling group and headed
for the door his legs were the least bit un-
steady in avoiding one man he bumped
into martin oday

  pardner old world dont seem big
enough for the two of us eh

  he paused and with tipsy deliberation
eyed the little cockney who wore clothes
intended for a man twice his size then said
the miner with drunken earnestness-
youve shrunk

  i aint i didnt dare grow big as you
lots o times i ad ter sleep in a barrel on
rainy nights an if yer too big yer get yer
feet wet im pertykular wiv my feet i am
the miner pondered the explanation
judiciously and seemed satisfied

  now take me-william burton thats
me im the biggest ass in this barnyard
full of big asses eight months ago i come
down from the mines with my stake gam-
bled lost sold my ticket to gel back to the
mines dug out another stake got as far
as sacramento lost it back to the
mines dug out some more started for
home got no home but i started any-
how got to playin here now broke
havent got any steamer ticket this time to
sell dont know how ill get back to the
mines but i got to go an dig

  let me go wiv yer

  bill burton eyed him with tipsy gravity
then admitted-

  you might be lucky but im broke-
as he spoke he fumbled about in his
pockets and drew out a flabby buckskin bag
squeezing it through his hand

  -all i got left just a pinch you
want to be my pard im bill burton no

-good broke

  yer all right im wiv yer

  i was in here on a ship when the news
hit-gold the whole crew jumped for the
mines made my stake three times
plenty more up there you furnish the out-
fit well go pards here-he thrust the
flabby bag at martin-all i got were
pards shake

  they shook hands settling the bargain
then burton started off suddenly hum-
ming

  i sy marlin ran after him i sy
where yer goin

  bed cant play cant drink cant
do nothing but sleep when youre broke
where you stoppin

  i aint found a plyce yet said martin
come on with me pard said the miner
and laid a forcible hand on marlin nearly
dragging him out of the magnolia and
across the plaza which on nearly the whole
of two sides and a part of the third was bril-
liantly fringed by the blazing and never
closed doorways of the gambling houses

  the lodging houses being full when bur-
ton heavy with dust came into the city
he had chanced upon a tent and carelessly
paid four ounces for a weeks rent it was
some four blocks from the plaza

  we bunk here he said and pushed
martin through the door

  burton lighted a lantern and hung it on a
nail he was too tall to stand upright and
moved about as if crouching lo spring on
somebody

  the floor and corners were littered with
odd scraps among which marlin with the
eager deftness of one who has pawed ash
barrels and alley rubbish rummaged he
found a broken flint-lock rifle a powder
horn a pouch heavy with bullets a de-
cayed rubber blanket a half sack of wormy
beans empty cans

  there was but one bunk burton flung a
bundle of blankets off it saying

  one thing we got blankets these are
mine i kept em for the ship give me a
dollar or something well flip to see who
gets the bunk the other fellow sleeps on
the floor
days of 



    i aint got no bloomin dollar said mar-
 tin cheerfully then added hastily re-
 membering that their partnership was
 based on his being able to buy the outfit-
  i dont sleep good on no bunk yer ave
 it billy i wont ave it i wont

   burton sat down yawning prodigiously
 he threw his boots one after the other
 across the room then tossed away his hat

    night little pard look out a rat
 dont lug you off-plenty of em big
 enough

   burton fell back on the bunk gave the
 blanket a swirl and though it fell in a way
 that only partly covered his body sighed
 deeply and almost at once began the regu-
 lar deep breathing of one who sleeps soundly

   gor blimey where the-bloomin

 -can i fin money i got ter ave it i

 ave

   martin waggled his head doubtfully
 five hundred dollars mr lee had esti-
 mated that in itself was wealth he was
 skillful in evasions and explanations but he
 knew that on the morrow whatever his ex-
 planations he would lose this big pardner
 if he did not have the money

   all that he had was the flabbily empty
 buckskin pouch which burton had thrust
 into his hand and now getting close to the
 lantern martin pulled open the mouth of
 the pouch and peered hard a few pinches
 of brilliant dust lay in the bottom he
 shook some of it into his hand and with in-
 quiring finger poked at the dust

   gold real gold the stuff that would
 buy anything yet he had seen so much
 gold piled about and carelessly handled on
 the gambling tables-stacks of it pouches
 of it-that for a moment he wondered how
 it could be so valuable

   he had hardly a vague idea as to what
 gold dust was worth but he thought it must
 take a lot to make 

   if a fellow was lucky at gambling-

 martin had never seen monte played before
 this night but he had quite readily caught
 on to the simple game

   martin weighed the bag thoughtfully in
 his small hand it was light very light

   heavy as lead he remembered saying
 as he held the well filled pouch of the ami-
 able mr lee

    he licked his lips and swallowed with dry
 throat as an idea trembled through his
 mind he moved closer and looked a little
 wistfully at his sleeping partner but he

also thought of stewart dawes the tall
pale cold gambler who had shot a man as
indifferently as he brushed the glint of gold
dust from his dark sleeve

  then he began to rummage among the
litter of rubbish in a corner of the tent and
his thin impudent pinched features had an
odd look of determination

vi

psfe night and day the magnolia
ran its games and bar and at
midnight though the crowd of
 loafers had thinned men still
hovered thickly about the tables

  in the city gold and silver coins were
plentiful though there were not nearly
enough for the commerce with the increase
of miners gold dust became even in the
city the medium of exchange as it was in
the mines where a gold coin was rarely seen

  when gambling with dust a man put his
bag on the table stated the amount of his
wager and the lookout placed a marker
against it if the player was unlucky this
bag would lie on the table until the num-
ber of markers showed that the entire con-
tents of the bag had been lost gamblers
by the weight in their hands were expert
at guessing the amount and value of the
dust

  heavy play was on at the table where
stewart dawes dealt the betting of two
men attracted the attention of many on-
lookers

  one of these was col nevinson a man
of middle age of striking appearance
smooth shaven except for a long black mus-
tache he wore a black soft hat black cut-
away coat and flowing bow tie and his
height was accentuated by a haughty erect-
ness

  he had reached san francisco in the win-
ter of  and was therefore an old-timer
no man had more diversified business in-
terests than nevinson he speculated au-
daciously particularly in the lumber trade
he owned the controlling interest in stores
throughout the mines had money invested
in gambling houses and city property yet
his chief interest was in politics when
california became a state he expected to
be united states senator he was domi-
neering generous with his friends high-
handed and regarded any man who op-
posed him as an enemy when he wanted


adventure

something he would have it or fight and
his wants were many

  he was almost constantly attended
some people said guarded by a slump-
shouldered cadaverous fellow by the name
of bruce brace who almost invariably held
his hands behind him

  now he stood beside the colonel but
did not at all watch the play he merely
looked vaguely about over the heads of the
onlookers his eyes were dull as if covered
with a sort of film and he stared here and
there with a seeming lack of interest in
anything

  oil nevinson was drinking heavily but
with no apparent effect beyond a slight
flush every few minutes a chinaman
came with a tray and bottle

  low conversation went on for some
man was saying that somebody had
just gone into washington hall ordered
the doors closed and had all the inmates
paraded a pretty dollar such sport would
cost

  col nevinson overhearing demanded-

  who is the fool

  nearly always he spoke with an air of
anger even to friends

  dont know colonel a fellow they say
that just rode in today made a winning
at somebodys table then went crazy i
guess

  stewart dawes glanced toward the tale-
bearer but said nothing

  at the other side of the table another
man of striking appearance was also play-
ing heavily and losing after a long run of
good luck he was a young slender span-
iard straight as a tent pole his name was
a proud one don jose roderigo velazquez
de sola except for the shadow of a smile
in which there was nothing pleasant his
face was a mask in two hours he had not
said a word

  the flicker of an impersonal smile hardly
relieved the cold hauteur of his face an
almost youthful face

  he was richly dressed his high som-
brero was overlaid with gold braid his vel-
vet jacket fronted with gold buttons
from the top of his right boot the handle
of a knife stuck up and slung from his
hip in a way that a spaniard seldom wore
a gun he carried a heavy ivory-handled
revolver in a greasy holster he wore
it low down on his tiiigh handle pointing
backward

near midnight martin oday
wriggled through the onlookers
and emerged at the elbow of the
spaniard

  make your game gentlemen said the 
lookout in a bored voice

  bets were placed martin did not catch
just what was the reason but dawes plac-
ing aside his deck moved his hand slightly
toward the derringer at his elbow and said
quietly to the spaniard-

  change your bet

  pardon sefior my bet eet was down
firs

  i said change your bell  and the edge
of dawes voice grew sharper his hand
moving nearer his gun

  the next instant he was looking into the
muzzle of the heavy colts revolver

  onlookers to right and left ducked some
going so far as the floor col nevinson
pressed back but did not dodge only
stewart dawes remained indifferently mo-
tionless as the smile on the face of the young
spaniard deepened and his voice softly as
a girls said-

  pardon senor i have not the wish to
change the bet you will plees deal

  dawes smiled coolly and with a move-
ment of wrist only turned his hand up
beaten he had made a bad play but he
was gambler enough to lose coolly

  the spaniard with a smooth quick move-
ment returned the revolver to its holster
and the little cockney gaped at him in open-
mouthed admiration

  i said col nevinson angrily though
speaking to no one in particular have
seen greasers whipped for less

  the spaniards eyes gleamed his lips
parted over teeth tightly clenched for a
moment as if too full of rage for words he
glared at nevinson bruce brace noticed
his slack body stiffened and the film seemed
to leave his eyes but his right hand re-
mained behind him

  where senor where did you see that

a spaniard wheeped where the span-
iard cried in furious excitement

  nevinson looked at him contemptuously
it was well known that nevinson did not
like greasers excepting of course dona
elvira eton

  i just came down from die mines a few
days ago and they tell of one of your dons
who was pegged out and soundly whipped
sir
days of 



 who senor the spaniard seemed al-
 most beside himself his voice had the men-
 ace of pain and anger do you know
 who did that thing

 bruce brace glanced expectantly toward
 the colonel but nevinson only said wrath-
 fully-

 who are you sir to question me

 -your soul sir what is it you want

 and you senor have you ever done
 that thing

 i said nevinson haughtily have
 struck whom i pleased and when

 ah the spaniard answered softly
 perhaps you plees now

 if i did you would have known it before
 this sir

 so then you do not plees ah

 aw make your bets gentlemen make
 your bets said the lookout

 martin oday from under his coat
 raised a heavy buckskin bag and cautiously
 edged it on to the table

 im playin the free spot wiv the gen-
 tleman ere he said gesturing with a
 thumb at the spaniard

 dawes glanced steadily for a moment at
 the small cockney his large cap awry his
 coat too large upturned at the sleeves his
 face underfed

 dawes said nothing there was much
 thievery in the city and nimble fingers
 pulled many a pouch from the pockcts of
 half-drunken miners with his eyes on the
 cockney dawes lifted the sack weighing it
 in his hand he glanced down without in-
 terest there was a rich sprinkling of gold
 dust on the mouth of the sack

 just under fifty ounces said dawes
 with expert carelessness

  ow much it wurf

 dawes stared penetratingly then again
 glanced at the sack-

 about eight hundred all of it on the
 tray

 martin nearly collapsed he had had
 no idea of weight or of weight translated
 into dollars

  arf of it arf of it he exclaimed
 anxiously

 the game is made droned the lookout
 laying markers against martins sack

 the cards fell in a moment the look-
 out swept the spaniards coins into the
 banks pile and shifted the markers to
 show that half of martins sack belonged
 to the bank

   oly eaven said martin looking up
reproachfully at the spaniard

  in a state of chills-and-fever tenseness
martin began to play against what re-
mained of his sack twice he had to bet
the last ten dollars allowed him by the look-
outs accounting but he won then he
kept on winning the spaniard lost nev-
inson lost but the cockney won until he had
the bag on his side of the table and some
gold coins in his hand at last desper-
ately for he was not getting anywhere by
small bets he risked the sack all of it on
the deuce

  the spaniard with his last dollar gone
lifted the band from his sombrero and with
no haste or irritation laid it on the table

  dawes picked it up idly examined it said
indifferently-

  fifty dollars

  the spaniard bet against the deuce and
lost martin won his eager hands scraped
in the gold gold pieces all of it he stuffed
his capacious pockets until they were
weighted with gold he had nearly nine
hundred dollars he crammed the buck-
skin bag into a coat pocket

  the spaniard glanced idly with a faint
suggestion of contempt at the cockney who
was clawing the gold pieces into his pockets
then rolled a cigaret neatly lighted it
and without a gesture or change of expres-
sion turned away

  just a minute said stewart dawes

  the spaniard turned with a flash of move-
ment but dawes hands were empty
though his right hand lay so close that it
touched the butt of the derringer from
his chair he looked up coolly without a
sign of what he meant to say

  greaser dawes began evenly the
next time you draw a gun on me shoot
because if-

  si senor with pleasure the spaniard
interrupted softly his dark eyes brightly
aglow he smiled slightly and stood mo-
tionless waiting

  dawes eyed him dangerously but being
a thorough gambler and patient for the
second time that night he realized that he
had been beaten this greaser was not like
others who could usually be humiliated be-
cause half the time they hardly understood
what was being said and knew besides that
they were unpopular with the crowd but
this fellow seemed ready for a fight with
anybody and if dawes memory served him


adventure

right the gun this fellow carried was very
much even to the holster like that of the
spanish-looking man who earlier in the day
had hit his bank hard dawes had the good
judgment to accept his luck however much
it hurt

  nonchalantly he cut his cards and began
shuffling

  there was hardly any one left at the table
to play the corpse-like bruce brace hav-
ing at last seen something on which his eyes
rested with interest had bent forward and
whispered to nevinson who instantly
stopped playing reassuringly reached under
his coat touching something there then
with brace at his heels pushed hurriedly
through the crowd toward the bar

  martin followed the spaniard and a few
yards from the table caught at his arm

  the spaniard whirled eyes narrowed
hand to hip but his hand fell away and his
eyes lost the glint of fierceness as he waited
but not as if likely to be interested

  i sy do yer need some chink matey
the spaniard looked puzzled and re-
peated doubtfully-

  chee-ink chee-ink

  blimey sure said martin jingling his
heavy pockets and grinning generously

  no senor i do not borrow from ameri-
canos

  but yer broke an sy i aint no
amircan-ho im henglish stryght i
been lucky you aint an i like yer
your pardon senor no with your
luck an a leetle cour-age senor-rthe bank
you would break eet you quect while
winning

huhn sy look ere i aint no bloom-
in ero but i sy-ill show yer wot i done
he nervously yanked at his buckskin
pouch dragged it from his pocket opened
it thrust it out

  look ere nothin but-

  it was dust all right just plain dust off
the street mixed with bullets which gave
ihe sack weight

  ah yes senor veree clevar you had
nothing to lose

  nothin to lose yer crazy that gam-
bler bloked ave shot me quickern ell
i was bettin me bloody life im hofferin
to loan-

  pardon senor no said the spaniard
firmly but in a reserved way friendly

  even as they talked together high voices
raw with anger came from across the room

  col nevinsons voice high pitched and
menacing could be heard-

  -you sir -your soul have inter-
fered with my affairs on every side-

  and you a forceful contemptuous voice
answered dont keep your affairs clean
enough to welcome having them looked
into do you

  -your soul sir apologize

  you sir can go to the-

  draw and defend yourself cried nev-
inson

  the words were not fully spoken before
shots rang out again and again and again

  men whooped in alarm and threw them-
selves to the floor under tables and benches
as shot followed shot

  then through the smoke two men were
seen standing upright-col nevinson and
bruce brace nevinson erect gun at his
side his left hand fumbling absently at his
right shoulder where he had been hit

  on the floor before the bar sprawled full
length face down dead with a gun that
still smoked in his fingers lay hubert
lee

  suddenly in the tense silence that fol-
lowed the reverberant crashing of the guns
monsieur max sent up a torrent of french

profanity and lamentation his voice
crackled his hands smote and clawed the
air and the crowd that rose from under
benches and reappeared through doorways
pressed in close to the bar and stared-not
at the body of hubert lee but at the great
mirror hopelessly marred with a star-like
blot almost in the center

  monsieur max abruptly stopped cursing
with a flourish he pulled a silk handkerchief
from his sash and grinning shouted tri-
umphantly-

  oh oh oh-pooh it is not for me to give

one - at ze twelve oclock tonight

monsieurs ze magnolia i sold him to ze
gentleman monsieur tesla it is for mon-
sieur tesla to do ze cuss words

vii

a few minutes later col nevin-
son appeared at the rooms of
dona elvira eton he pushed
by the negro girl who opened the
door and stormy with excitement and tri-
umph cried-

  ive settled with lee

  lee i didnt know he was in town
days of 



elvira exclaimed from the high-backed teak
chair where she had been reading a spanish
novel she did not rise but her dark eyes
widened with a moments look of pleasur-
able excitement as nevinson continued
striding toward her-

  it had to come he got me here-
touching his right shoulder as yet un-
dressed-but i put a piece of lead into his
heart

  nevinson with frowns and a manner of
angry tenseness together with some harsh
names for lee remained standing and told
of the encounter he mentioned too that
bruce brace had fired

  -brace missed hit the new mirror
thunder strike his soul that glass cost
money and now i mean to have an interest

in the magnolia by -- i get what i

want id told bruce not to draw-not un-
less i was down but when he saw me stag-
ger-touched here- he gestured at his
shoulder-he drew that gun of his no
bigger than a toy can almost cover it in
his palm he just grins when i laugh at the
thing-a toy yet hes done work with it-
two men good friend brace lee and i
had to have it out blast his soul dressed
like a greaser-that hat pah i thor-
oughly hated the man-

  elviras attention soon withdrew from
the colonels story shootings were very
common almost incredibly so at first
when she had come to the city to hear of
them had been exciting now the colonel
was being tiresome

  as with everything else she owned she
occasionally grew tired of him he was
valuable as a friend and generous toward
her in a way generous toward whomever
were his friends elvira knew or thought
she did all the strings to his rash explosive
character and could touch any at will ex-
cepting it seemed the one that controlled
his use of that offensive word greaser
nevinson appeared to hate everything
spanish excepting herself hubert lee had
worn a sombrero she had not known lee
at all no doubt he too would have been
generous toward her at any rate all men
were she thought of that other man
hales who too wore a sombrero and had
inquired for hubert lee

  nevinson strode here and there about the
room at times putting his hand for a mo-
ment to his shoulder he talked justifying
his grievances with a detailed recital of the

many things lee had done and tried to do
lee had shouldered him out of the deal to
buy the magnolia or tried to he had put
lee-blast his greaser soul-out of the
way

elvira laid her book aside and
picked up a silver-backed mirror
formerly her mothers also pre-
occupiedly she examined her face
her hair her pendant earrings she touched a
stray wisp here and there rubbed at what
appeared to be the beginning of a wrinkle
then laid the mirror aside or rather to one
side face up listlessly she began to roll a
cornhusk cigaret and leaned over a lit-
tle absently looking at herself in the mir-
ror

  elvira knew nothing of her father ex-
cept that his name was eton and he had
been english there the matter ended and
she was not curious but her mother had
been a remarkable woman understanding
the intricacies of a man-owned world and
was long and well known if not entirely
reputably in havana where many slave
ships outfitted for the long dash to the
gold and ivory coast and such as escaped
british gunboats brought back profits to
share-holders the mother spoke english
fluently about the only scholastic require-
ment she imposed on elvira was that
tongue the reason being that as senora
eton said the english and yankee are such
men as give give give-if the woman is
beautiful

  among much eke that was priceless
though hardly scholastic the mother had
taught elvira that the only things worth
while to a woman were her beauty other
peoples money and that men should be
kept underfoot-where they belonged

  this remarkable mother had been blessed
with courage as well as with wisdom
smallpox crept into the city terrifying
everybody senora etons face was irrepar-
ably blighted then the redoubtable woman
who had taught her daughter to live
showed her how to die quite calmly with
a mirror in her hand as if from it receiving
the fatal sentence senora eton drank a
glass of poisoned wine and so departed
from a world where according to her simple
beliefs a womans face was more to be
valued than her life

  the news of gold in california at the
time regarded as a spanish country had


adventure

reached havana when elvira was ready to
leave the city she had lost favor with cer-
tain persons of municipal importance and
an immediate departure was if not neces-
sary at least desirable she had been ac-
companied by tota a pretty negress who
spoke spanish only and by an odd scoun-
drel who went under the name of ferdinand
he was some sort of spaniard but could
make himself understood in almost any
tongue

  this ferdinand was a broad-chested
shaggy - headed but beardless rascal a
world wanderer who had done everything
been everywhere-on slave ships in the-
atrical troupes as musician and performer
with robbers ashore and afloat and in many
prisons in his youth the officials of cadiz
had clipped his ears the better to know
him if they should meet again frenchmen
had branded his shoulder and sent him to
the hulks but as he said this was no place
for a man of a roving nature so having
filed his chains in secret he departed head-
long into the water at night and was re-
ported drowned

  it would take more than water appar-
ently more than rope to end his life

  in havana one afternoon elvira at-
tended by a rather elderly military person-
age sat on a balcony to witness the hang-
ing of a half-dozen rogues executions fas-
cinated her and at that time they were
something of a holiday event in havana as
formerly in london and paris the prison-
ers were being brought to the gallows in a
wooden cart drawn by oxen one of these
was a powerful fellow who though his
hands and feet were tied stood upright
against the wooden railing of the cart joked
with the crowd and sang snatches from a
witty ballad about sweet mistress hemp
who had a ready caress for good stout
men

  dont let them garrote that man said
dona elvira to the important personage
who at the time was very much interested
in pleasing her

  he was a gallant man this official with
much authority he wrote a dozen words
on a small pad taken from his pocket and
gave the paper to an orderly a few min-
utes later amid the noisy joyof the crowd
ferdinand was led away reprieved

  later elvira accompanied by the offi-
cial visited ferdinand in his small cell
where he was ironed to the wall learning

what she had done for him he fell on his
knees before her called her an angel and
swore that he was persecuted only because
he was an honest man and the world was
full of rogues there was even then a
vague good-natured insincerity a kind of
twinkling in his tone that interested her
and caused even the official to smile toler-
antly

  my poor man how could you sing on
your way to death

  queen of angels only evil men fear

death

  elvira learned from authoritative sources
that he was a thorough rogue and some
said that he was not a spaniard at all but a
basque he sang well and could play any
stringed instrument that was ever placed
into his hands but his most distinctive
accomplishment unless it was that of break-
ing prison was that of knife-thrower he
had once traveled about europe with
mountebanks going from fair to fair at
ten paces he could send four knives rapidly
one after the other into a playing card and
sink the steel of each an inch or more into
solid oak

 at this time dona elvira had money
and friends of importance she was pleased
to slip a little gold and a few smiles here
and there among certain persons who looked
after the welfare of the city and though a
notorious rogue ferdinand passed from a
reprieve to a pardon

  at first she tried to make a sort of house
servant of him but though always or
nearly always cheerful he was untamable
she did not grow tired of him so much as
almost afraid of him he was enigmatic
talkative but in a way that she could not
penetrate secretive he never asked her
for anything and more than once he gave
her money-as if trying to pay his debt
she did not dare ask how he got it always
he spoke of her as the good dona al-
ways he was respectful even at such times
as she in a passion might call him a thief
and gallows fruit and he would greatly
frighten her by his steady stare and rapid
speech that ran inflectionally all in a breath
from humbleness to menace and back again
she was relieved when he occasionally dis-
appeared and she was always pleased to
see him when he returned yet frequently
she had anxiously thought of denouncing
him to the authorities for she did not
understand him but knew that he was
days of 



dangerous he spoke spanish even with
a slight accent as he did english and
french she felt that he ought to be more
of a grateful slave than he was

  but elvira had been very glad that he
was at hand when she wished to to leave
havana he too was ready and eager to
reach california

  they had no sooner got to san francisco
than ferdinand with a guitar over his shoul-
ders and a knife in his belt set out for the
mines he returned shortly without cal-
louses on his hands and with much gold in
a little while he was off for the mines again
returning soon california he said was a
great country he placed a sum of money
in the good donas hands and asked her to
buy for him a certain portion of this won-
derful land naming the place-an old
spanish ranch-not far from san fran-
cisco ferdinand could not read nor write
he was very insistent about this ranch
whatever it cost he said that he would get
the money she even visited the rancho
and found it an isolated and rather dilapi-
dated place

  she inquired what on earth he could want
of it and learned that ferdinand was or at
least said he was preparing a home for his
old age this being about as near the truth
as anybody could ever get out of him

  she had as usual with anything like busi-
ness turned to col nevinson in the matter
of buying this ranch and he always put
himself out to accommodate his friends

  elvira also thought california a great
country but she did not look so far forward
as to see old age old age like her own
death was something of which she would
never let herself think

  she restlessly craved excitement her
instincts were if not dramatic at least
theatrical always hidden at her breast
she wore a dagger of pretty workmanship
one that on occasion she had drawn the-
atrically but never used in certain moods
it pleased her to see men shrink before her
blazing eyes and that gleaming sliver of
steel she had been tempted to try this on
col nevinson but he was too a good friend
too entirely hers to risk losing besides she
hardly thought that he would shrink she
spent her idleness in reading spanish nov-
els revengeful of plot through which women
moved artful and unforgiving with jeweled
daggers worn secretly

  even here in san francisco where there

was little to buy and much gold she was
wasteful of money but resourceful very
resourceful for instance at a time when
the city was bare of furniture she had been
able to get nearly all the furnishings she
wanted-the kings palace would hardly
have supplied her with all that she wanted
at least for any length of time-through
col nevinson who bought the stuff from
the captains and caretakers of the crewless
ships out on the bay

now having lighted a second
cigaret dona elvira sat back
blew the smoke upward and with
slumbrous-eyed disinterest lis-
tened to col nevinson

  -i found out that he was telling here
and there that i brought her to califor-
nia-

  her who elvira asked quickly with
something of jealous alarm who are you
talking about

  ann hales

  oh she sprang up alert interested
sensitively ready to be jealous

  oh what demanded the colonel
bruskly what do you know of her
nothing my colonel but somewhere
-oh quite vaguely-it seems i have heard
-that name havent i i wonder where
lee told two or three persons by god
sir ill call any man to account for lies
about me or woman sir or woman she
bed about me too

  what did she say my colonel

  elvira watching his lips as if to catch the
words before she heard their sound stroked
tenderly at his coat collar her fingers
touched something moist she jerked her
hand back then hastily rubbed her fingers
on his sleeve she felt a pleasurable slight
shudder and for a moment hardly listened
to what he was saying but looked intently
at the moist red stain she had touched

  why sir she said-or at least that
blasted greaser of a lee claimed she said
that i i sir brought her to california
she happened to be on the ship that was
all i swear to-i wont swear to anybody
sir i simply state the truth she was on
the ship true i had known her before
but i had nothing to do nothing at all with
bringing her to california or with what hap-
pened to her after she got here no sir
ah said elvira inscrutably

  col nevinson looked at her suspiciously


adventure

  why do you say that ah

  ah no reason my colonel what hap-
pened to her after she got here tell me
more of her where is she now

  there is little to tell she was married
to a man she did not love an army officer
who left her much alone-with good rea-
son too any man would soon have left
her she was crazy

  ah-ah continue my colonel dear
what became of her where is she now

 fire and - woman you are not

jealous

  i jealous of who no no i like
romances to read them-to hear them
tell me more this husband of hers what
of him may he not come to california too
-looking for her-for you

  he is dead-not that i would care
col nevinson added quickly giving one end
of his mustache an upward twist i did
not bring her she had gone to the devil
long before drank i soon lost sight of
her here

  so fickle you men elvira murmured
playfully but now where is she

  why do you care

  when i read a novel i read to the end
even the dull ones my colonel

  she went from bad to worse and is
now in some sort of lodging house sydney
woman keeps it i hear down by clarks
point she was for a time in washington
hall got thrown out of there col
nevinson shook his head as he said it
wretched indeed was the woman who must
fall lower than the lowest of those in wash-
ington hall

  and she was beautiful once

  once yes i should say she was but
never a good woman never her husband
was killed during the war and-

  ah perhaps thats how i have heard
the name there was much in the news-
papers at one time-i read of it in havana
-about a captain hales who fought a duel
between the armies yes yes i remember
he was a scout and-

  at any time it rather irritated col nev-
inson to hear other men praised and with
an abrupt finality he said-

  all i know of him is that he was
killed

  but many men have been reported dead
that lived and everybody comes to cali-
fornia what if he should appear asked
elvira slowly but thrilled

 i dont take a step backward from any
 man sir

 i wonder- elvira murmured think-
 ing of the dark horseman

 you what

 i wonder is he dead are you sure
 she got a pension he was a captain
 but not-this a little contemptuously-
 of a military family leather merchants
 lee was a hide buyer here in california for
 the firm somehow he found out who she
 was that she was here-and meddled

 -his soul

 i see said elvira

 what do you see he asked sharply
 many things my colonel hubert lee
 may have sent word east to her people-

 to the husbands people i mean and-

 what are you talking about why
 would lee do that anyhow

 oh to make trouble for you dont
 you see supposing just supposing the
 husband should come

 let him come

 ah- admiringly or seemingly so-
 you fear no man

 no man sir

 but women ah she asked teasingly
 you-yes of course he said twisting
 one side of his mouth into a sort of smile
 meant pleasantly

 where is she this ann hales where
 did you say

 why do you care she is nothing
 may i not be curious

 the place is called the red lamb so
 lee said he told a fellow that the fel-
 low told me i dont know

 red lamb what a name and i am
 curious you say she was once beautiful
 she was yes no doubt about it
 she was once

 and rich her husband was rich
 rich family now

 very rich very so i heard he said
 without interest putting his hand to his
 injured shoulder

 and this husband was he handsome
 colonel what did he look like

 never saw him

 the name hales colonel is it a com-
 mon name in this country

 why the- are you so full of ques-
 tions

 i am curious i have nothing to do with
 myself but be curious hales is a common
 name colonel
days of 



  there are hales in the east lots of
them

  it is so common then that-ah you
dont jump when you hear it

  jumpl jump no i dont jumpl not
when i hear any mans name

  not- at times with playful malice
she struck the chords that made him ex-
plosive-when you know he is dead
whats the matter with you tonight
how dare you woman say a thing like that
to me

  ah- humbly-pardon my colonel
i but played come we will sit over here
close together and you shall tell me about
this woman you once loved when she was

pretty

  no he said a little soothed but still ir-
ritated no youre in one of your woman-
ish moods tonight im going to a doctor
she went to the door so graciously with
him was so soothingly tender that he was
tempted to linger

  dont my colonel remember when
your elvira has been naughty and teased
she kissed him with the clinging insistence
of a woman who means to be loved whether
or not the man is willing and he broke
away good-naturedly saying-devil
elvira pushed the door closed and stared
cxcitedly at nothing-

  devil i am and can call the dead
jealous ah-ah of him ho what a fool
to think it with him i can do anything
and for as long as i want but senor dick
hales-ah rich very rich and handsome
what a fool she must have been total

  yes dona-yes said tota entering
anxiously

  elvira picked up the mirror and looked
into it as she spoke-

second time the senor dick will be more
polite i warrant you and she that hales
woman was once beautiful i wonder
blonde or brunette i forgot to ask

bill burton slept late and
awakened hungry but late as
it was martin huddled into a
lump under the blanket still
snored the big miner shook him out of
the blanket martin awakened with grop-

ing gestures pawing about him to make
sure that he had not merely dreamed of
winning from stewart dawes table

  he tried to tell burton about it but bur-
ton was hungry interested in the story but
more interested in beefsteak and eggs
having gold winning or losing it was an
old story to him

  burton taking strides as if he wore seven
league boots instead of cowhide led the
way the little cockney with repeated
rushes tried to keep by his side but could
do hardly more than follow with a sort of
hurried-stumbling over the rough ground

  from somewhere thin piercing cries
reached them burton stopped with a jerk
his heels planted at the edge of a bank down
which he was ready to jump he turned his
head all about curious uncertain trying to
tell from where the sound came

  wots up

  dont you hear it

  blime ow yer goin elp earin of it i
ear a baby squallin

  burton turned and walked uncertainly in
the direction that martin pointed and after
a few steps stopped

  thats a baby sure wonder whats the
matter with it

  bellyhake said martin as if he knew
about babies

  down here somewhere

  burton went forward with an air of awk-
ward caution as if not quite sure whether
or not he ought to go then pointing with a
gesture of discovery at a lean-to affair of
pine boards

  in there

  the baby wailed as if in the pain that is
greater than death

  whats wrong you reckon burton
asked peering hard as if sure that martin
was better informed about babies than him-
self

  its sick

  burton swore in vague protest then went
close to the lean-to bent his head listened
he raised a fist that could have smashed in
a barrel hesitated knocked timidly he
stepped back quickly as if a little afraid of
what he had done

  with scrape and tug the ill-fitting door
opened and a woman peered out

  her hair was down her back she was
young but her face had the weariness of
hard work and privation her gray eyes
stared anxiously the baby continued
	adventure

with wail on wail she held a wet cloth in
her hand her dress was torn worn dirty

  from within the shack a mans voice
 now weak but suggesting a powerful voice
 diminished by sickness asked-

  who be it hetty

  what you folks want she asked doubt-
 fully with the harsh nasal inflection of the
 backwoods

  maam we aint wanting-we just-
maam is there anything us fellows can do
who be it hetty what he be wantin
of us

  the baby screamed scream on scream
 ezekiel these folks ask if they can help
 usens she said blankly incredulous

  yes maam thats sure it burton
 affirmed loudly

  the voice of ezekiel proclaimed as if to
 a congregation

  the merciful man doeth good to his own
 soul then in weak eagerness- ask
 em in hetty vite em right in

  she stepped aside nervously glancing
 about the small rude shelter and burton
 crouching as if to enter a low cave came in
 with embarrassed slowness

  a thin gaunt man of powerful bony
 frame lay on two boards placed on boxes
 his eyes were dark and sunken he was
 bearded like a young prophet one thin
 blanket was his covering the baby amid
 some clothing in a crate waved tiny fists
 and with eyes tightly shut yelled as if in
 fury at the injustices of this world

  just look at that little dickens said
 burton admiringly

  my good man is powerful sick the
 woman answered

  neighbor you do look pretty peak-ed
 friend answered the sick man it is
 the punishment of the lord

  hes a preacher said hetty wistfully
 glancing toward him then abruptly-
 were methodist

  you look-hard up too the miner

 blurted

  the rev ezekiel preble with passionate
 fervor answered-

  he that is greedy of gain troublcth his
 own house

  he lay on his back and could not move
he was full of fever but filled too with the
deep inner fire that has inflamed prophets

hes a powerful good man the woman
muttered anxiously looking at martin i
in the midst of the babys crying the
preacher pitching his voice as if from a
pulpit explained-

  i come to califomy drawn more by the
lust of harlot gold than by a burnin to do
the work of gadamighty and in a
tone of approval added his wrath has
visited me

  whats you needs a doctor neighbor
the mother had stooped to the baby
lifted it but the baby continued to scream
beating the air with its fists

  i endure suffrin for the sin o covet-
ness

  hes got bowel trouble said the wo-
man swaying the baby up and down

  i aint seen a baby in five years bur-
ton told her that is not a real one in-
dians have babies up to the mines

  the wrath has descended on my son
droned the preacher

  babies aint no right to suffer said
burton

  the poor is hated even by his own
neighbors but the rich hath many friends
said the preacher

  christians ort o be pore mrs preble
put in helplessly not hanker after vani-
ties

  all go unto one place all are of the dust
and all turn to dust again

  ezekiel she protested timidly

burton asked

state but they lit out fer the mines yester-

  maam- burton was edging backward
toward the door-heres some money-
little pard shell out an that aint all
neither therell be some folks up here to
help you pretty soon

  he ducked backward and out and hur-
ried off toward the plaza

half-known heroes

by charles nicholls webb

h half-legendary half-histori-
cal their careers only handed
down by word of mouth a host of

- minor traders trappers voya-

geurs coureurs du bens and prospectors
move through the story of the old north-
west those who left the most complete
chronicles of their wanderings were either
too modest to be just or too romantic to be
veracious

  ordinarily men of action are not writing
men when like captain john smith
they take their pens in hand it may be
reluctantly and under pressure or solely for
the sake of publicity

  many of the legendary figures of the
northwest intrigue us by the veil of mys-
tery they wear there was wolf hunter
graham whose exploits in southwestern
wisconsin were of the sort to make a group
of corner-store patriarchs cackle rather than
stir the interest of a student of history he
was merely the mighty hunter to whom the
pioneers chose to attribute every remark-
able feat of marksmanship that came to
their attention similarly paul bunyan
the lumberjacks myth may have started
out as a normally constituted but somewhat
unusual woodsman in point of strength or
performance

 greasy reed was a story-teller-a
mighty liar rather than a mighty hunter-
and as such his fame is handed down he
lived so close to our own times that there
are men now alive who sat in his cabin and
heard his monstrous tales of hunting-
stories of impossible feats invariably fol-
lowed by the modest declaration and it
want a good day for huntin neither
the old munchausens favorite attitude
was to lean back in his chair with eyes
closed and head resting against the wall
his youthful hearers would slip out of the

cabin one by one leaving the old fellow
talking away to an empty room

   back still farther lived the trader grant
who gave his name to a river and a county
of the state of wisconsin and the story of
whose life is fragmentary even in the legend
for instance he is said to have owned a
lead mine or rather a cache containing an
enormous quantity of lead for which pros-
pectors have searched unsuccessfully many
times

  the story goes that he traded with the
indians particularly in southern wiscon-
sin and so impressed the savages that they
thought he possessed supernatural powers
grant is said to have worn a copper kettle
close to his head under his cap and on one
occasion is supposed to have owed his life
to this peculiar habit of dress he was over-
taken by a band of hostile indians the
leader of which brought his tomahawk
down upon his head with all strength the
only immediate result of the impact was a
metallic sound and the astounded indians
threw themselves on the ground with the
exclamation manilaul

  ever afterward the indians regarded
the trader as a god exactly as they
had regarded the explorers radisson
and groseilliers in the seventeenth cen-
tury

  who grant was and where he came from
is not known b w brisbois writing for
the collections of the wisconsin historical
society thinks he may be identified with
a canadian trader of scottish descent
cuthbert grant who led a ragged army of
woodsmen in the fighting between the fur
companies that however is merely conjec-
tural his name is perpetuated by a river
and a county but history does not furnish a
single corroborated statement regarding his
career

author of south west and north the star goes north etc

  i l was sitting with lawtonon the
  veranda of the club when cap-
  tain tubbs came along with the

  - malay thus i had a personal

and perhaps a bit irritated insight into this
end of the story and the remainder came
to me afterward from lawton and other
sources

  old tubbs took off his helmet and
mopped his hairless skull then jerked a
thumb at the hulking brown figure behind
him the malay was still standing

  lawton he said ive brought a boy
for you never another like him he
speaks no english wants to go into the
hills with you best quartermaster i ever
had

  lawton looked young and was not he
looked gentle and was not he looked lazy
and was not all the same his gray eyes
were wide apart and he was slow to believe
ill of others and he was very new to borneo
he could speak a little low malay no dyak
he looked at the standing man not small
and trim and dish-faced like most malays
but a shaggy and scowling figure

  i am going up into the hills said law-
ton slowly with tuan thorsen we are
not smuggling we have government au-
thority at the same time the hill country
is never very safe do you wish to go as my
own man serving me

  yes said the malay the one word i
leaned forward a bit heated

  is that a proper way of speaking is it

the custom to remain standing in the pres-
ence of your master and other white tuans
the brown fellow looked at me with his
scowling glance captain tubbs cleared
his throat and spoke up rather anxiously

  give us a chance you chaps he dont
mean anything by it his way thats all
hes not one of your crawly kind but he
wont lie

  if i hire you said lawton you will be
faithful to me

  yes said the malay

  do you know the hills

  yes and the sea i have been a
nakhoda

  this put a new light on it the persain
word is applied by the malays to one who
both owns and navigates his ship a title of
much respect just then thorsen strolled
out on the veranda and halted in astonish-
ment at sight of a native standing instead
of sitting thorsen was a big fellow burly
and yellow-haired laughing most of the time
though seldom with mirth he had a heavy
hand with every one beneath him

  is this a sultan coming to visit us he
sneered sit down you dog

  the brown man scowled at him and did
not move lawton held up a hand

  one minute thorsen im taking on
this boy hes an odd type but faithful
maybe said thorsen were not
going on a tourist jaunt with a bodyguard
of rajah brookes soldiers are we no
were going where they use sumpitan darts


brown kurvenal



on whites you got to make the brown-

respect you or its all up

  this man will respect me said lawton
now you have full charge of every one else
so suppose you leave my own servant to me
if you think hes disrespectful you need not
speak to him if he inspires the other men
with insolence ill dismiss him i think
youll find they will be a little afraid of
him

  youre crazy said thorsen ask any
one if im not right huh

  he poked a thumb at me and i nodded
  youre right

  lawton lighted a fresh cigaret and smiled
in his lazy manner

  im stubborn he said and i know
a man when i see one come here malay
the brown man stepped up to him and
looked him in the eye

  you are engaged tuan tubbs will ar-
range the terms with me your name
inchi la-uddin

  i give you another name it is kur-
venal so was named an ancient warrior
very faithful to his lord it is a name of
honor

  allah reward you tuan i am no mans
servant but yours

  i think that is true said lawton
you may go

  kurvenal looked us all in the eye with a
sweeping glance bowed his head slightly
and stalked away even captain tubbs
looked a little uneasy since the mans inde-
pendence was very marked here at the club
thorsen called for a drink and dropped into
a chair

  youll regret it he said

  perhaps agreed lawton lazily i
think not

  thorsen had been a long while in borneo
but had never been able to manage things
on any very large scale until now though he
knew the dyak country better than most
and had been where no other white men ever
penetrated he had the strength of four
men in his splendid body and lawton was
lucky to get him as a partner

  lawton had been in sumatra then up in
yunnan where he made quite a pile he
came to borneo thinking to turn it into a
fortune the chances were good as he
stood very high with the government cam-
phor and gold dust he must turn in of course
but there were other things thorsen could
get them if any man could now that he

had capital and trade goods with which
to operate

  i wondered and others wondered how
the two men would get on together and con-
cluded they would make a go of it not
every man got on with thorsen but lawton
had a quiet way of being blind to irritating
things and was not the type to interfere
where he did not know the country he
had given thorsen full charge of affairs at
least temporarily the only danger was lest
thorsen might come to have a contempt
for him missing the steel beneath the calm
poise

  no one could blame thorsen for distrust-
ing the malay this kurvenal was utterly
unlike most of his race-an outcast perhaps
he was very square and powerful with a sul-
len scowl and a peculiar shaggy appearance
nor did he chew betel paste for his teeth
were white and firm he never spoke ex-
cept when addressed outside prayer hours
and had absolutely no respect for any one in
word or look not that he was deliberately
insolent it was simply a natural indepen-
dence never a good thing in a country where
white men are accustomed to being treated
as demigods and exact such treatment

  so the two partners got off up-river and
no word came from them for a while

ii

it is a fallacious belief of young
women and stay-at-homes that
good folk do no wrong novels
foster this notion and cinemas
religiously nourish it a character is la-
beled good or bad and never departs from
that line except for godlike causes pish
and tush you and i know better only
a poor angelic weakling would ever be like
that and kurvenal our brown kurvenal
was far from a weakling

  two days after the party left the boats
behind and plunged into the hill country
kurvenal bringing up the rear of the line
with lawton disappeared and did not re-
turn for a matter of two hours when he
appeared he was carrying a small pottery
jar and there was a dark stain on his sarong

  so youve been killing and looting
asked lawton chiefly in jest

  yes said kurvenal

  eh lawton now saw thestain on the
silk to be blood is this true

yes said kurvenal and gave him the
adventure

pottery jar this holds something more
precious than gold tuan

  lawton examined itfound it to contain
a dark sticky pastta horrible odor and
frowned	

 whaln

  cure for the poison i hat these infidels
use it is impossible to buy it from them
so i took it no one will pursue us by
allah

  lawton did not like the implication but
said nothing thorsen remained ignorant
of it

  they were going through the higher
jungle heading for the hills with plenty
of dyak bearers they followed a native
runway through the forest a worn groove
of a path knee-deep in most places with
here and there a little mound of stones or a
dyak signal all this while kurvenal served
lawton impeccably a perfect servant in all
ways except that he never cringed he
knew the forest and hill country spoke
dyak fluently and was of high value to
the entire party

  he did not get on with thorsen there
was no surface collision because thorsen
had far too much sense but evidently he was
irked by the malays independent manner
it did not spread among the other men how-
ever they seemed afraid of kurvenal
this surly shaggy malay so different from
most of his flat-faced race so thoroughly
acquainted with their language and customs
and country inspired them with a species
of terror lawton heard them saying that
upon him was a curse and he himself
divined a certain tragedy in the man some-
thing at once piteous and terrible as if
kurvenals surly independence were but part
of a fight against some impending doom

  still lawton told himself all this was no
more than fancy and pushed it aside from
his mind he lectured kurvenal and the
latter remained entirely respectful toward
thorsen in his own fashion but so far as
possible avoided the big blond leader

  thorsen was heading for a definite point
trying to reach a certain village of golong
dvaks whom he knew once there as he
explained they could pick up a lot of hard
camphor immediately and send it back by
their learers to the trading post on the river
then he and lawton would go on to where
they could find some stones lawton agreed
in his quiet way he was quite content to
leave everything to thorsen and remain a

colorless nonentity so long as the expedition
got results

  all this changed however when they
reached the golong village

  it was sunset their escort had been
hammering a brass gong ever since day-
break at intervals and all day long gongs
had been sending answers from the hills a
queer clang of sound reverberating over the
jungle lifting and thinning into echoes car-
rying code word that not even thorsen could
interpret by this time the entire country
for a hundred miles around knew that white
men were coming to the golong village for
prying eyes can see and thundering gongs
can speak and there is no privacy in the
hills

  rovally welcomed for the sake of thor-
sen formerly known here they filed into the

golong village by this time lawton was
accustomed to the large houses built of
iron-wood poles and the notched logs by
which one climbed to the entrance when
the biggest house was turned over to the vis-
itors he took one of the rooms and told kur-
venal to unpack his things the leeches
had been bad that day and lawton had
kept his puttees sudsed with carbolic soap it
being impossible to avoid the climbing hor-
rors otherwise and now he wanted a change
of clothes instead of obeying kurvenal
vanished and did not comei back until the
morning he did not lie he had been drunk
and disreputable

  lawton was taken aback by this absolute
frankness before he recovered thorsen
came striding up with big news so that he
dismissed kurvenal for the moment nor did
the matter come up again for punishment
events followed too swiftly

  two hill men out here to see us said
thorsen abruptly a hint of excitement in
his blue eyes better come out they
musnt think im alone it might cost me
my head later

  lawton nodded and went with him out-
side the long-house in the open space for
councils the old men were squatted and
with them two visitors two brown hill dy-
aks tattooed and grinning each carried a
long snmpilan or blow-gun with a tiny sheaf
of needle shafts whose poison would kill at
a touch bow and arrows and long painted
shield and two knives

  the two white men joined the part
there was much eating and little talk un-
til at length one of the old men began to
brown kurvenal



jabber and the visitors made response
the two were ill at ease like any country
folk come to a city for this golong village
was a city indeed being not merely one
long-house but many houses of all kinds
talk went on and while lawton could make
nothing of it thorsen could a sudden low
word broke from the big man

  my sainted aunt he said his eyes
gleaming it cant be true

  he jumped up and went into their abode
and came back with some gifts beads and
mirrors and a pair of knives the two dy-
aks received these and talked more freely
and excitement grew upon thorsen talking
with them lawton waited and smoked
patiently until at length thorsen turned
to him

  they want one of us to go with them
they say a white man was up in their coun-
try for two years got sick and died he
had collected stones all kinds get that
he left the lot behind him they think
theyre devil-stones and will trade them
gladly chances are it was some dutch-
man from the other side who was on his own
escaped criminal perhaps anyhow if its
true we have a fortune ready to hand

  how far from here

  three days they say off in the hills
our friends here dont know much about em
it may be all a stall to get a white head of
course theyd like to have this yellow
hair of mine to stick around a shield
thorsen laughed if we both went theyd
take heads and trade goods too if i go
and you stay theyll be scared to touch me
for fear youll come and burn em out ill
make friends with em in three or four days
and then everything will be fine theyll
not dream of touching us then

  lawton nodded he understood how
thorsen would make friends he would
impress himself and his power strongly on
the dyaks until they would be mortally
afraid of him and it was of course the only
thing to do it were folly to be squeamish
out in these hills where the authority of the
dutch sepoys of the british flag of rajah
brookes men were equally lost and un-
known here each long-house domiciled
from four to twenty or more families and was
a law unto itself the smoke-dried heads
of men were trophies tokens of authority
and prowess and craft while wealth amount-
ing even to god-head was in green jars old
green semiporcelain jars chinese traders had

fetched to the islands in the days of kubla
khan these dyaks were savages a white
man was safe among them only if he reached
their sense of fear first and foremost and
not always then

  youre taking long chances going alone
to investigate this thing said lawton
slowly

  sure not half so long as if we both
went though and youre taking chances
enough remaining here im not trusting
these golong chaps any too far

you want me to lay low i suppose
yes theyll bring in hard camphor
soon enough theyve sent out gong mes-
sages about it already you can trust that

-surly malay of yours on the trading end

of it he knows his business i will say and
he can steer you itll come from the low
country i suppose these folks havent
much to do with the hill tribes except to
get heads thank heavens ill have no
more leeches all dry upland country
ahead

  when do you leave

  iu find out

  thorsen gave his attention again to the
palaver lawton watching and listening
decided that he rather liked the general at-
titude of these hill dyaks they were sav-
ages but they were curt and direct knew
their own minds being simple folk with
very simple ideas of right and wrong and
even simpler notions of outside power
their god lived in a green jar they made
no secret of how well thorscns crinkly
blond hair would go on a shield because
they thought every one else would have
the same envy of it presently thorsen
looked around at his partner

  going now in five minutes ill jump
up and go with them see get my rifle and
tell those two boys of mine to come with the
packs i have everything else ill need
send for you if the game looks worth while
lawton nodded he rose negligently
and strolled off into the long-house then
snapped orders at thorsens two favorite
men these hasily caught up packs and dis-
appeared after ten minutes the two hill
dyaks suddenly rose to their feet and asked
if thorsen wanted to go with them now
this moment it was cleverly done they
thought to catch him unawares and they
looked blank when the blond giant heaved
to his feet and took the rifle lawton handed
him and set off on their trail they were


adventure

already going and going fast the two
bugi boys fell in at thorsens heels then
all five vanished along a runway leading
into the trees

  the disappearance was sudden lawton
as was his habit smoked on and said nothing
seeming quite unperturbed he wondered
how thorsens hair would look decorating
a shield it was long yellow-red hair with a
decided wave crinkly after it was stripped
off the head would be none the less a trophy

  the old men slunk away the talk was
over lawton remained alone presently
he saw a hulking figure approach it was
kurvenal the surly malay came and sat
down beside lawton it was hard to tell
whether he was insolent or subservient he
drew out a tiny chinese sleeve-pipe filled it
with a pinch of tobacco and lighted it

  i saw those two men tuan lawton he
said abruptly they come from a place
called api gujong it is a section of the
hills yonder very rough and savage avoided
by all other natives allah upon them

those infidels are- their long-houses

are scattered all about the trails are closely
set with traps and having no fear of such
natives as live in this village their men are
often away on the other side of the hills
hunting the bugi folk

  lawtons eyes opened in astonishment at
this long seech

  and how do you know so much about
these infidels kurvenal he demanded

  the dark sullen eyes flashed to his

  because once i was a slave among them
tuan i got away and i swore to return
some day and pay my debts now tuan
an army could not overcome those dyaks
of api gujong many rifles could not get
into their country or reach their houses
one tap of the brazen gong and they would
rush to defend the runways and none could
force entrance so cleverly are those ways
defended

  yes said lawton wondering a little
at the inward excitement of the brown man

  but you and i alone tuan could bring
death and destruction upon those infidels
and gain a rich loot from it by allah i did
not want them to see me i kept hidden
i know all their runways in this direction
and how the traps are set and i have the
little jar of poison antidote i can take you
to their first long-house by night so that you
can come upon it unawares and slay them
all and take their gold-dust and young girls

what an army can not do you and i can do
in the name of the prophet on whom be
jjeace we can show these hill rats how men
fight

  you have vengeance to seek said
lawton

   may fixe be upon me but not sharnel-l
shall take a heavy price

   i have none to each man his own cus-
tom kurvenal it is not my custom to de-
stroy folk without cause furthermore you
eat my salt and take my pay so that you
can not do this thing until i set you free
that will not be soon because tuan thor-
sen has gone with those men of api gujong
and if we make war upon them they will slay
him

   kurvenal filled his little pipe and emptied
it with four puffs

   as allah liveth tuan i think you are a
fool he said gruffly

  few white men would have stood either
the words or the lone in which they were
uttered lawton smiled

  by all the ninety-and-nine beautiful
names of- i agree with you he respon-
ded lazily still why think you it is so

   tuan thorsen will put a bullet into you
if it is worth while or will bring about your
death in other ways said kurvenal bluntly
it has happened before this when he and his
partners have found something very rich

   that will do said lawton an edge to
his voice you will not talk about tuan
thorsen in that manner again you
may go

   the shaggy malay rose and departed

   lawton smoked at his ease his brain busy
with the warning he had just received it
was not a new thing to him one or two
men had given him hints he now realized
before he started out with thorsen twice
had the latters partners died on previous
occasions and men remember these tilings
so lawton had really gone into the game
with his eyes open knowing how some
people felt sorry for him and it made him
smile a little

   more surprizing was the new light thrown
upon kurvenal by the slavery story and
lawton thought the malay had possibly
worked very hard to be taken on this expedi-
tion certainly the man craved vengeance
upon the hill dyaks and was not to be
blamed the manner of his vengeance
however would be a bloody one and law-
ton frowned at the thought he must not
brown kurvenal



let the malay make use of him in this man-
ner as for thorsen much would depend
on what was found if the hoard of stones
proved to be a true story then there might
be trouble in the air one could not be too
careful

ill

  ijfn hard camphor came in a good
deal of it from the lower country
around and a little gold-dust
some bird of paradise skins and a
good deal of other stuff none of it interest-
ing to lawton under kurvenals guid-
ance he traded for everything offered pick-
ing up a few small diamonds but none of any
value he had a commission from a scien-
tist in singapore for one or more of the sa-
cred green jars at any price but these he
could not buy at mention of them kur-
venal smiled sardonically

  i know where there are two tuan he
said if you are not a fool we might get
them by tomorrow they are sacred jars
married to each other gods dwelling in them
and each is half the height of a man to re-
deem them the api gujong people would
bring many diamonds much gold-dust
they would lose anything on earth rather
than those jars

  as you have said returned lawton im-
perturbably i am a fool and therefore we
will leave them alone

  kurvenal snarled an oath and said no
more but one day as he sat smokingin
silence he looked up at lawton and asked a
strange thing

  tuan when i came to you and you gave
me a name you said it had been the name of
a warrior faithful to his lord it is not an
arab nor a persian name where lived this
man

  in a far land called lyonnesse said
lawton

  curious he outlined the tale of the knight
of lyonnesse laying somewhat of emphasis
upon the piteous and devoted kurvenal and
changing the whole to accord with the men-
tal vision of the man before him when he
had finished the malay nodded

  you did well to give me that mans name
though by allah i would have used my
sword where he failed his master was a
fool he should have taken the woman
if he had married her after the setnanda
fashion of our people the king could have
nothing to say about it a mans honor

is a different thing in different lands how-
ever

  you are fond of calling people fools
said lawton

  the other nodded in surly fashion

  why not it is true as allah livelh
four people out of five are fools they know
not how to do that which they do the man
who knows and does may well term them
fools when i put my hand to a thing i do
it four other men vacillate and call upon
allah and look aside and wonder that the
thing goes amiss may the angel leave
them in-

  lawtons eyes gleamed in admiration
here was the gospel of efficiency preached as
eloquently as he himself had ever preached
it he rather hoped to see kurvenal in ac-
tion not knowing that his hope would be ful-
filled with no great joy to himself sooner
than he thought

  on the sixth day after the departure of
thorsen the brazen gongs spoke from the
hills after long silence it was no message
for the golong people though these trans-
lated it and gathered in groups looking out
tothe hills and sent forth parties of warriors
nor would any tell lawton what it was
about kurvenal finally unearthed the se-
cret from one of the bearers a man compre-
hending the distant brazen clangor lifting
through the hills and brought the word to
lawton

  the api gujong men have sent off a
party to seek heads and this is a warning
to all folk telling how the runways arc
guarded by traps and how no visitors are
desired which way that party goes is
not said probably against the bugi peo-
ple on the other side of the hills toward
dutch territory so at least runs the
word though it may be a lie

  lawton thought little of it that same
afternoon however returned one of the two
bugis thorsen had taken with him

  the man came late in the afternoon an
hour before sunset and was escorted by two
of the village hunters he was exhausted
from rapid travel and could only hold out
a bamboo section to lawton then tumbled
over in a faint from which other men re-
vived him lawton opened the sealed bam-
boo joint by splitting it and there fell out a
hurriedly scrawled note

  come quickly as possible with one or two men
no bearers needed chance for huge cleanup here
but must have help most of local men leaving


adventure

today on raid bring shotgun and packet of
rockets	thorsen

  lawton communicated the contents of
this note to kurvenal then turned to the
recovered messenger and questioned him
tuan thorsen had sent him in all haste
yes all was well they were at a long-house
on a hillside above a rice paddy a rich place
with many young girls in the upper room
and many heads the dyaks had guided
him part of the way and had given him a
safe conduct by gongs yes he could
lead tuan lawton back there and some
dyaks would meet them on the morrow

  let us go and winnow the wheat from
the chaff said kurvenal to lawton and
went to the veranda of their own house
lawton balanced his camp chair and lighted
a cigaret the shaggy malay squatted on
the iron-hard bilian poles and fastened his
eyes on lawtons face

  now tuan there is truth in some of this
tale he said abruptly for when i was a
slave in those hills i heard of a white man
dwelling among the folk i know this place
to which tuan thorsen has gone it is the
second village or long-house one meets go-
ing from here what says tuan thorsen
come bringing one or two men he knows
you would bring me so he plans to kill
you and me both at one stroke

  lawton was startled nonsense such
talk is folly

  wise men regard folly sometimes that
bugi hunter is a liar he had no safe
conduct for that is not given and he could
not have come part of the way by himself
for there are traps and he would not dare
face them he came with some api gu-
jong ment and these are waiting near at
hand this is a trap and i tell you not
to go

  i do not accept orders-i give them
said lawton coldly it may be the man
has lied but this is no trap tuan thorsen
has no reason to kill me as yet therefore
i go to join him though i will be very
watchful we leave in the morning

  so it was arranged said kurvenal with
sardonic humor for the messenger to get
here this evening they know you will not
start before morning tomorrow night you
will reach the first village and unless you
are first slam they will kill you there

  cease this talk of killing said lawton
coldly you are led into madness by your
hatred of these api gujong folk later it

might be so but not yet do you wish to
go with me tomorrow

  i do not growled the malay

   lawton stood up and left him and ordered
two of his men to be ready with the things
thorsen had desired brought theyfroum
leave at full daylight with the bugi and this
meant at five in the morning

  a clamor of voices brought lawton out to
the notched log at the front of his dwelling
with the first light one of the village chiefs
was there furiously angry and others were
coming while lawton found his own men in
consternation and disarray to his angry
questions one came forward to serve as in-
terpreter and explain

  the malay has vanished tuan he ex-
claimed he has taken your spare rifle
he has stolen a very fine old sumption and
a bag of darts from this chief and some food
he has also taken that little jar of his and
they say he was drunk last night

   tell the chief said lawton that i will
make good his loss

  he desires permission to pursue the ma-
lay tuan he must have gone down the
river

  let him go in peace ordered lawton a
little bitterly tell the chief that i will
repay all that is missing and more

  so the matter ended except that lawton
remained very angry and hurt over it all
he had somehow believed kurvenal to be
not only faithful but a little devoted to him
the value of the stolen articles would be bal-
anced by wages due the man this and
the abrupt leave-taking did not matter so
much as what it would lead to

  lawton knew very well that the malay
had not gone down the river he had start-
ed into the hills to work out the vengeance
his heart craved and with the first dyak he
slew there would be a storm of wrath let
loose upon lawton and thorsen more-
over lawton was angry with himself be-
cause he had misjudged the man and had
stuck to his guns against thorsens advice
for now he must endure taunts and to en-
dure these from thorsen was no light
matter

  there was no delay because of all this
however breakfast over the three natives
assumed their loads and started the bugi
hunter in the lead the other two following
lawton brought up the rear with his rifle
as they left the village a gong thudded
behind them its irregular brazen beat
brown kurvenal



booming up in long cadences and then
was silent again

oddly enough this little inci-
dent effected lawton very power-
fully it was too much like a
message to thorsen it was a
message of course telling of his departure
and yet it gave him a helpless feeling a
man any man starting off into those hills
of the api gujong was worse than helpless
behind him boomed those gongs and ahead
of him and far into the dim high distances of
the hills telling all the world about him
where he was going what his errand was
all the power of the while man and his
weapons was set at naught by those bits of
sounding brass so that the dim shrill mut-
ter of them was like ironic laughter from the
throats of savage gods lawton felt all this
 for the first time with an overwhelming
sense of his own littleness and then he
was swallowed up in the forest with his
three brown men following a runway worn
nearly knee deep with the sharp green
walls of the forest to right and left and the
world forgotten

   this queer sense of oppression was per-
haps akin to loneliness kurvenal was
strongly noted in his absence so much for
personality however gruff

   hour succeeded hour and gradually the
trail wound into higher country the for-
est became thinner other runways were
crossed more than once but nowhere had
lawton seen a living creature save a few
animals and the winged things overhead
he was uneasy over having met none of
the dyaks twice they came upon traps
and the bugi hunter had missed the first
only by inches rather it had missed him
the hidden bowstring twanging viciously
and the poisoned barb whistling as he
frantically ducked a wild pig saved them
from the second dashing along the runway
ahead of them and springing the hidden
snare so that a spear darted down from
above and transfixed him squealing the
bugi cut his throat and brought him along
for dinner

  so came noon the four halted for an
hour beside a bubbling little stream and
cooked the pig lawton heard no more
gongs alarm from the hills the meal
finished he was smoking quietly to one
side when from the screen of verdant
brush there stepped a dyak warrior fix-

edly gazing at the party

  like most of his kind when m the open
the man was hesitant trembling ready to
fly at the first movement one of the na-
tives came forward a little and addressed
him he was armed with shield and bow
and quiver a sumpitan over his shoulder
a bag of darts at his side and his rectangu-
lar shield was tufted with human hair he
looked from lawton to the interpreter and
ventured a few words

  he has come to guide us tuan said the
interpreter

  we are ready take up the loads

  the three obeyed they set off after the
dyak and he disclosed a runway they had
not previously seen a winding closely over-
grown trail between walls of green and ap-
parently little used lawton brought up
the rear with the coming of this guide
all had readjusted itself and he lost his un-
easiness at once in the course of the ensu-
ing hour the guide three times checked
them and led them past traps which other-
wise had taken toll two pits and one trigger-
spear cunningly hidden

  now they came to a steep hillside rather
open of trees but thickly cloaked by giant
ferns twenty and thirty feet in height and
among these the trail zigzagged as it worked
to the crest of the hill to one of these
sharp turns the little dyak warrior trotted
sharply wheeled and was hidden from sight
behind him followed the bugi and the two
bearers as lawton came to the turn he
heard a sharp cry from the men he halted
peered forward saved himself at the very
brink of a ragged and lightly covered pit
into this the three men had fallen headlong
while the dyak guide had vanished in the
forest

  lawton flung himself backward stood
swaying an instant to recover his balance
from the pit rose a sharp medley of voices
and then the bugi tracker came into sight
climbing on the other two he came head
and shoulders out of the pit scrambling
then from the trees leaped a sharp twang
and the man fell back with an arrow trans-
fixed in his breast

  lawton needed no telling to know that he
was a lost man yet he could see no enemy
he flung up his rifle waited eyes flitting
among the giant ferns from his right
came a slight sound and he whirled as he
did so from the other direction there silently
soared a net it fell about him fairly and


adventure

was drawn taut he went down lost his
rifle in the frantic but vain endeavor to clear
himself and then struggled as the net closed
about him after a minute he relaxed hav-
ing got both hands to his belt and lay mo-
tionless

  half a dozen little dyaks poured down
around him they looked in at the pit edge
and laughed then surrounded the captive
white man poking fingers at him chatter-
ing among themselves two others joined
them eight in all

  then like a flash of light lawton moved
he had been resting preparing desperately
making ready for his sole chance the
knife slid from its sheath and slit the net
with one slash from waist to knees leaving
his arms free another slash and he was
free to the shoulders he seized his auto-
matic

  they were already hurling themselves
upon him with shrill cries but so swiftly had
he moved that he won the game barely
a club sent him staggering yet he whirled
and opened fire the heavy reports of the pis-
tol shattering the daylight lifting sullenly
to the hot sky two of the men fell-a third
the others leaped into the brush and van-
ished lawton freed himself from the net
picked up his rifle went to the edge of the
pit and called his two men

  a spear whistled passing between his arm
and his body he fired twice in response
so they meant to kill him now that they
could not capture him a stab of pain
through his arm and as the rifle fell he stag-
gered from the shock an arrow hung there
barbed head gripped to the bone he seized
if fiercely and tore it loose despite the sick-
ening pain then a slight prick in the hand
another he looked down and saw two of
the tiny blowgun darts in him and knew he
was poisoned and would die quickly

  he reached for his automatic again took a
backward step plunged into the pit

iv

no sooner had lawton van-
ished than a dyak came leaping
forth arrow set on string and
darted to the edge of the pit the
pistol cracked from below and the dyak
flinging up his arms fell a victim among his
victims

  the others learned caution they came
out all four of them grinning and laughing

well they knew lawton would die before
long when they could have his head for the
taking and those of the others as well one
of them produced from a wrapped bundle a
small gong of brass evidently a chinese
trade gong of heavy metal hanging from a
long cord a man held this up high while
the owner struck it with a short wooden ba-
ton the sound lifted sharp and reverber-
ant and it was not hard to guess they were
signaling the village how all had gone well
with their mission

  the man holding the gong lowered it as
the message was done suddenly it escaped
from his hand and his fingers flew to his
throat the striker stared at him then
whirled about and about like a stricken cat
clawing at one armpit the other two dy-
aks leaped to their feet but two shots rang
out from the thicket of ferns and they fell
forward and lay quiet beside the one who
had held the bell and who lay gasping out
his life the bell-striker now stood motion-
less feeling the place under his armpit where
the poisoned dart had gone in he was
doomed and he did not even stir as the shots
rang out but stood wailing hopeless

  from the suddenly waving ferns stepped
forth the figure of kurvenal rifle in hand

  here were six dead dyaks one rattling
and fast dying and one on his feet to the
last came the shaggy malay grinning and
pulled out his knife the dyak made no
effort to fight did not try to draw either his
long fighting knife or his little sharp behead-
ing knife he stood and looked in kurven-
als face and recognition suddenly leaped
in his eyes

  yes dog it is i said kurvenal and
plunged the steel into him the dyak
pitched forward across his dying comrade
coolly kurvenal wiped his knife replaced
it picked up the slit cords of the net and
then leaped forward to the pit-edge

  tuan lawton are you able to move
then catch quickly quickly

  he flung the cords over made fast the end
of the draw-string to a tree and leaned at
the edge peering down presently he leaned
farther and reached lay down and reached
caught hold of lawtons hand and tugged
he came to his feet and lawton rose over
the edge and stood there staggering in the
hot sunlight among the giant ferns law-
ton was deathly white his head was swim-
ming horribly everything was going round
and round and he could only just realize
brown kurvenal



that kurvenal had shown up to save him
a frightful laugh broke from him and he
held out his swollen hand and arm now
turning black

  poison no use

  he found himself speaking to the empty
air the malay had disappeared law-
ton turned reeled lost his balance and went
down with a crash and his senses fled

  out into the sunlight crawled the two
coast men kicks and all and as they came
erect kurvenal appeared and looked at them
with his surly gaze he was carrying his
little jar

  go and find water and see that you come
back soon he said you will die unless i
save you leave those loads here

  they left the packs and hurried away
kurvenal went to lawton pulled the latter
into the shade of a fern leaf and opened up
his jar he spread the brownish contents
thickly on hand and arm and bound it up
then he examined the ragged arrow wound
in lawtons other arm this had not been
poisoned but none the less kurvenal tied
it up with some of the brown salve then
took out his little pipe and smoked

  presently the two men came back bring-
ing water kurvenal wet the bandages
about lawtons head poured water between
his lips and settled back to regard the two
brown men with his scowling look he ges-
tured toward the pit

  what message did that bugi bring you
from tuan thorsen

  none responded one

  kurvenal took the fine sumpitan he had
stolen from the village he set one of the
tiny darts in the biow-pipe and lifted it
toward the suddenly terrified men

  speak or die he said without emotion

  nay we speak both cried out together
and one continued he bore word that we
were to fear nothing that we were not to be
injured whatever might befall tuan law-
ton

  i thought so said kurvenal grimly
and ye said nothing but came in silence
pigs harken in the name of allah with
out me ye are lost to return to the village
safely is not possible for you are coast men
and do not know the ways of the hills and
cannot avoid the traps go forward you
cannot since these api gujong men have
already slain tuan thorsen

  that drove terror into them and their
eyes strained at the figure of lawton

  he is not dead said the malay to-
night he will bum and cry out in agony
and we must bind him hand and foot to-
morrow he will sleep tomorrow night he
will waken and demand food and be himself
except for weakness now if ye do not
wish to obey me go if ye stay there will be
no changing of minds else ye die quickly
nay we stay inchi la-uddin they
said in unison

  good i have a rifle ye bore a gun
and there is the rifle of tuan lawton
gather the two and guard them take
that net and of it make a sling in which to
carry tuan lawton take the sumpitans
and all the darts of these dead men for we
shall make a great killing with them ere the
night is past take your packs also then
follow me i will destroy any traps
those two men were no cowardly weak-
lings or they would never have come this
far from the coast they were of some
sea-dyak tribe by nature pirates and kill-
ers and the malay wakened the terrified
souls in them knowing themselves good
as dead anyway they decided to put their
trust in kurvenal his manner impressing
them with its perfect confidence so they
made ready as he ordered prepared a ham-
mock-like sling from the net and from vines
and in this placed the senseless lawton
when they picked him up they had a stag-
gering burden but they made no complaint
and set out after the shaggy malay

  kurvenal knew what he was doing and
was fairly certain of his ground the brass
gong had sent to the nearest long-house a
message of success and this had no doubt
been relayed on to thorsen another two
days away at the main settlement the
first group dwelling was not far distant and
probably most of its warriors would be
away it would be quite unsuspicious and
kurvenal had no idea of letting any alarm
be sent out by gong

  the afternoon was wearing along when
the two bearers found him waiting for them
in a tiny hillside clearing they gratefully
set down their burden and flung themselves
to earth but the malay regarded them
dourly

  ye do well to obey he said

  that is true returned one you are
a tuan of much ability a tuikhoda

  we need a roof to shelter tuan lawton
tonight

  true nakhoda inchi


adventure

  my name is kurvenal he said it
takes the place of my galar my name of
manhood if ye can not twist your tongues
to it no matter half an hours travel
from here we come to a long-house of the
api gujong folk whence came those men i
slew i go ahead ye follow my magic
shall clear the dwelling but it is advisable
that ye wait here until the sun has fallen
then hasten on and gain the place ere full
darkness comes is it understood

  it is understood nakhoda they said

  kurvenal investigated their packs and
took several of the rockets thorsen had
ordered no doubt for the purpose of ob-
taining impressive effects with these and
lawtons briquet or cigaret lighter he gath-
ered up his weapons and strode away along
the trail and so was gone among the trees

his progress was uneventful
he came upon more than one
trap and sprang them and went
on smiling grimly for there was
little about the ways of these hill folk he had
not learned presently he came into sight
of the long-house and crouched watching
it was a large structure on a sloping hillside
kurvenal was a hundred yards from it on
the upper side the ground between being
cleared and on either side to a like distance
behind it however was a much larger
clearing where the ground was level for a
space before dropping again and here was a
rice paddy the rice now all waving green
and silver-blue in the setting suns glare

  from the huge curved and thatched
room of the long-house was going up a
steam of light smoke so kurvenal knew the
women were crouched over the fires cooking
the evening meal out before the place
were numbers of old men and a few war-
riors not many girls were fetching water
from a stream close by in calabashes and
gourds and woven containers

  kurvenal made ready his rockets very
carefully knowing enough about such
things to aim them as he wished the
old men awaiting the arrival of the raiders
with lawtons head were watching the for-
est impatiently on th veranda of the
house above the notched log kurvenal
could see a large brass gong suspended
being down-wind he settled himself to
smoke and wait

  presently the sun was under the western
trees and already the swift shadows were

stealing along the forest now kurvenal
waited no longer he scratched the briquet
until the string of tinder was in a glow went
to his first rocket and touched it off with
a hiss and a roar the streaming serpent of
fire smashed directly amid the group of old
men before their wild yell had ceased
there was another hiss and the second
rocket shot forth

  it drove straight into the opening of the
long-house something kurvenal had not
figured on for he did not want to burn the
structure however the rocket dropped
through the poles of the floor and burst
on the ground underneath the building in a
stream of blue and red balls there was a
squealing and scattering of pigs a shrieking
of women a shrill panic-scream of children
and old men from the front and back
streamed the occupants of the place crying
that the devils were come out of the forest
upon them the various rooms vomited up
their occupants everything was abandoned
in frenzy of terror

  kurvenal smiled grimly to himself and
moved to his last rocket as he had fig-
ured the panicky stream of fugitives was
pouring for the closer shelter to the left
here some of the old men and warriors
checked them tried to get some order into
them and then hissed and roared the last
devil heading directly for them in a stream
of sparks striking down one or two of
them shattering among the trees in a wild
burst of colored fire that was too much
warriors and old men alike fled and the en-
tire population of the long-house streamed
away into the far recesses of the forest

  the malay knowing that none had
paused to watch strode out across the
open space to the big structure he went
through it carefully pushing aside the mats
before each family compartment food was
cooking work half done everything aban-
doned midway he came upon no living
creature yet found what he sought two
green jars wrapped in mats in a room to
themselves

  he brought them into the first chamber
and stood them in the corner each jar half
the height of a man then he settled down
to make a full meal from the prepared
food darkness came and found him on
the veranda where he took the big brazen
gong from its standard and thrust it into
the thatch overhead after a little came the
two men with their burdens and the voice
brown kurvenal



of kurvenal bade them advance without
fear finding him here and the dyaks
vanished gave them new awe of him

  he had them bring lawton into the com-
partment where the two green jars stood
then sent the weary men to collect food and
rest he himself dared not sleep he knew
what would happen later on after the moon
rose he sat by lawton and tended him
and presently bound him hand and foot
gently yet firmly for fever and delirium
were getting in their work

  from lawtons supplies kurvenal pro-
cured a tremendous dose of quinine and
forced it down the white mans throat re-
newed the dressing from the little jar and
waited the quinine forced a sweat and
temporarily produced results the malay
left the chamber and found the two men
asleep he opened up their burdens got
out siimpitans and darts and two rockets
and with these and the other blow-pipes
found in the place arranged his defenses
then he settled down to smoke and watch
the dark edges of the forest upon his lips
a grim smile of anticipation

  by allah there will be a blood payment
taken this night he muttered licking his
lips then they will go away for a while
and i shall go too and settle a little more of
the debt it is evident the warriors are
all gone so the second long-house will also
lie undefended except that tuan thorsen
will be there unless he is dead well i can
sleep tomorrow and work tomorrow night
and come back here afterward

  it was hard to keep awake for he had put
in a long day already yet he managed it
the moon lifted slowly over the encircling
trees and kurvenal made out flitting
shadows at the edge of the clearing he
went and shook the two men awake and
instructed them what to do and where to
find the weapons awaiting them they
stole away the ironwood poles of the floor-
ing creaking a little kurvenal leaving
them the rear was posted in shelter on the
veranda with two blow-pipes and many
little darts ready to hand carefully placed
that he might not set finger on the poisoned
end in the darkness inside he could hear
lawton beginning to toss and moan with
the wearing off of the quinine

  from the first conception of his plan
kurvenal had counted on this moment
he was a malay his faith was the creed of
islam he lived simply and without pretense

he meant to kill and that was all there was
to it as he watched the creeping figures
come stealing in upon the long-house to see
if the devils had departed he grinned de-
lightedly they must not come too close
lest they stab up through the biuan poles
of the flooring but he waited until they were
crowding in before giving the signal

  then it was lawton who gave it in a
sudden wild piercing cry of delirium the
dyaks froze in terror-only for an instant
one after another cried out as the blow-pipe
darts flickered and bit fast as kurvenal
and his two men could send the needle
shafts horror and fright took hold upon
the crowd as those tiny missiles of death
streamed in upon them doom in every
scratch they flooded back broke went
shrieking for cover of the forest again and
through die darkness now tenfold more ter-
rible in their full brilliancy hissed and
roared two devils of flame

  on the heels of this leaving behind him
explicit instructions for the care of lawton
kurvenal seized the food and weapons he
had prepared and he too vanished into the
dark forest

v

jgsrj- all that night and late into the
following day kurvenal traveled
jjgl like a madman going fast and
 far among the api gujong hills
knowing all this district from long and
bitter experience he made use of certain
secret runways which were not guarded by
traps and ran without fear then being
close to his destination he curled up and
went to sleep and remained in slumber
until moonrise

  wakening he took up his journey fin-
ished it in an hours time and came to the
second long-house where he had once been a
slave where thorsen presumably now was
having no time to waste kurvenal lifted
his rifle and plumped two bullets into the
structure at the proper angle to rake the
upper room where the young girls were shut
at night then he waited

  screams shrieks an affrighted outburst
of voices and then an outburst of terrorized
figures speeding in all directions for the
shelter of the forest not knowing whence
had come those two shots five women in a
clump came running directly for the malay
when they were ten feet from him he


adventure

stepped into the moonlight and leveled his
rifle

  stop he said in their own tongue
you remember me do not shout or i
will kill you now come on into the shad-
ows here quietly remember if you cry
out you die

  they were quick to recognize him again
and came forward in trembling fear and
horror kurvenal had been looking for
tuan thorsen but saw no signs of him

  where is the white man with yellow
hair he asked of the women

 we do not know he went away yes-
terday four of our men went with him
 the malay grunted angrily he took off
his tattered sarong removed the few gar-
ments the women wore and with these
twisted strips of cloth bound four of them
firmly neck to neck so that the four were
allin a chain the fifth he set out in full
sight and ordered her to wait there she
obeyed trembling thinking he meant to
kill her

  by this time some of the dyaks were re-
turning from their flight-warriors these-
to see if the long-house was safe again
kurvenal lifted his rifle and fired at them
he continued firing killing them relent-
lessly in the moonlight then sending his
bullets along the edge of the forest where the
fugitives lurked until his magazine was
empty he pointed the rifle at the un-
bound woman

  go yonder gather a great load of food
and bring it bring also the green jar that
is in the inner room behind the red mat
set fire to the thatch as you come if you
fail to do all this i shall kill you like those
others if you do it you shall go free

  the shivering woman obeyed ran across
the clearing to the long-house and darted
inside after a little she came out again
staggering under an enormous burden for
the wrapped jar was half the height of a
man in size voices leaped at her from
along the edge of the forest but she made no
answer making her way toward the malay
a sudden yell pealed up as there mounted
a red glow and a crackle from the long-
house then bowstrings twanged the
arrows searched the woman in the moon-
light so that as she came to kurvenal she
reeled and pitched forward and died there

  the malay divided her burden among his
four captives he had no time to lose now
thorsens absence worried him and he dared

not remain here any longer it being no part
of his plan to let these dyaks learn just
yet his identity the more mystery in
this deadly blow the better he must go
and let them rescue what they would
though he regretted not having taken care
of their brass signal gong

  march he ordered the four women
and as they went forward kurvenal had a
last glimpse of the great long-house in the
moonlight flames were crackling at one
corner of it and a long billow of smoke was
wavering up along the curved roof a dense
cloud mounting into the sky a laugh
curved his lips as he threw away his empty
rifle and drew lawtons pistol and plunged
along the runway after the four captive
women

  allah upon them the infidels are pay-
ing he said exultantly still he had a
long way to go and with the women could
not go very fast

  at almost the same moment when the
malay was opening fire upon this long-
house back in the other house lawton
came to his senses all that day he had
slumbered in deep sleep carefully tended by
the two men there had been no return
of the dyaks to their home for now they
were convinced that devils occupied the
place and they had scattered in the hills
what remained of them

  lawton felt quite himself but very weak
he lay for a little trying to think where he
could be a fire flickered slightly and he
saw woven mats realized that he was in a
long-house he remembered now that
kurvenal had come at the last minute
he tried to call out but his voice was very
weak as it sounded the mat across the
doorway waved and the two brown men
entered they came to him and raised him
up and gave him hot broth from before the
fire lawton drank and questioned them

  they told him where he was everything
that had happened it was hard for him to
understand his mouth was thick with
fever every joint in his body ached intol-
erably the effort to comprehend made his
head swim he drank more broth and then
fell asleep

  with morning he wakened again con-
scious of his weakness quite clear-headed
he was unable to stand but at his order
the two men lifted him out to the veranda
where they gave him food and drink they
took the brown paste from his hand and
brown kurvenal



cleansed him and he found himself in good
shape except for his weakness two pin
pricks showed on his hand no more
out here in the hot morning it was very
pleasant

   a breath of air struck sometimes across
 the clearing and the sun was revivifying
 through any crack of the thatch overhead
 the sunlight poured down in a tiny insuffer-
 able ray white-hot as iron until the bilion
 poles steamed to the touch in tiny streamers
 of mist the sunlight was like molten
 liquid working through all tiniest crevices
 burning hot intolerable

   that morning lawton heard very distant
 gongs the two brown men heard them
 also but could not interpret the message
 those thin clangorous beats came from
 the long-house attacked and burned by
 kurvenal the previous night for the dyaks
 there had rescued their brazen voice half
 of the morning they sounded now dying
 away now swelling a little on the breeze
 sending a terrible and fateful message across
 the hills

  those dyaks did not know who had
smote them but they could guess and called
upon their gods also upon their brethren
of all this lawton knew nothing however
 since neither he nor his two men could
interpret the brazen voices

   it made lawton uneasy that his pistol
 was gone with kurvenal strength was
 slowly coming back to him in another
 day or two he would be largely himself he
 thought later in the day he walked about
 the long-house and examined those two
 green jars with interest in case of need
 he might even have used his automatic
 though as yet a rifle was beyond him
 there was no need however for lawton
 had no suspicions

   he saw the huge figure of thorsen appear
 suddenly at the edge of the forest and come
 toward him and his one feeling was of huge
 relief he did not know what kurvenal
 had evoked from the two brown men who
 were now sound asleep somewhere inside
 the house with the fever still tormenting
 all his members with his brain still gripping
 at feathers he was incapable of remember-
 ing clearly he only saw thorsen felt a
 surge of joy pass through him realized that
 this was his partner a white man every-
 thing else escaped him then he saw the
 four dyak warriors behind the giant blond
 and could have laughed to note the obvious

 fear in which they stood of thorsen three
 were lithe young men the fourth was a
 thin stalwart old man gaudily adorned with
 beads and feathers the two knives at his
 belt in large carved wood sheaths and the
 shield on his arm tufted with dark human
 hair

  these four did not want to approach
the long-house and halted thorsen turned
and urged them on and from the gestures
lawton conjectured they wished to wait
for him at the edge of the clearing they
had clearly picked up some apprehension of
the place perhaps from its very silence for
the bodies of the dead had disappeared long
since thorsen broke into violent speech
but at this instant lawton dragged himself
partly upright and lifted his voice

  hello there glad to see you come
along

  thorsen whirled and stared at him
blankly for an instant cut his tirade short
and then slowly came forward the four
dyaks lost no time in retreating and disap-
peared at the green verge of the forest
thorsen walked in toward the veranda
came to the notched log mounted it as
nimbly as any dyak and stood staring

  by grog this is a surprize he exclaimed
at last why the blighters told me you
were dead said youd been scuppered by
a party of raiders from some other village
i was on the way to see about it

  eh lawton frowned trying to think
collectedly no one of the men was the
guide well no matter you can ask those
two men about it theyll know sit down
and enjoy life im a bit groggy with fever
was poisoned getting all right

  lawton dropped toaseat thorsenglanced
around swiftly his sharp blue eyes stabbed
in all directions his attitude was one of
poised and tensed alertness of suspicion
yet he could not retain suspicion of this
pallid and weakened man before him

  want a smoke he asked craftily

  lawton shook his head and laughed

  fever still spoils the taste thanks call
those two men theres food in plenty

  thorsen sat down cross-legged he
picked from the floor a carmine mangostecn
large as a grape-fruit and tore it open
crushing the pulpy red fruit into his mouth
thirstily then he wiped his lips he had
not shaved for two days he drew out
cigarets and lighted one his sharp eyes
boring into lawton


adventure

  wheres everybody he demanded

  i dont know lawton frowned a
little i found myself here last night-
must have been here a day or so the two
men said kurvenal had found the place de-
serted they talked about magic and blow-
guns but i was too flighty to understand
very much there hasnt been a dyak
around here oh yes-i got your note
thats why i came

  it was an effort for lawton to think he
still needed hours more of sleep

  wheres kurvenal now asked thor-
sen narrow-eyed

  i dont know havent seen him
thorsen puffed at his cigaret a moment
then rose and stepped into the long-house
whence his voice presently lifted as he wak-
ened and addressed the two natives he
was gone for some time lawton relaxed
drowsily and was nodding when thorsen
came back to the veranda

  you go in and get to sleep said thor-
sen youre- in bad shape well stop
here until morning ive had a hard time
of it since yesterday somethings gone

wrong with those-men who came with

me it was the gongs this morning you
heard em cant trust those dyaks a
minute

  there was an odd predatory glare in
thorsens eyes a fixed intensity vaguely
alarming to lawton he came to his feet
passed a hand across his forehead remem-
bered

oh what about the stones find em
thorsens lips curved in a smile and he
took from his pocket a bulky leathern sack
there we are plenty for both half

a dozen fine sapphires -knows where

they came from certainly not from around
here the rest are diamonds and look like
first quality stones ive got to trade
rockets for em ive made those dyaks be-
lieve there are spirits shut up in the rockets
and setting oue off will protect em for a
couple of months from the forest devils
youve got a few left fortunately ill
have a palaver with my four dyaks tonight
and pay em up think that scowling
malay will be back

  he should be said lawton

  thorsen took his arm and helped him in-
side back to the pallet of mats there
lawton dropped down and was asleep
almost at once thorsen looked down
at him laughed a little and returned to

the veranda he called the two men and
talked with them at length then left them
to watch and flung himself down to sleep
until sunset

vi

toft lawton woke to semi-darkness
roused by a thudding sound it
came aan- he sat up recog-
nized the sound of a brazen gong
thorsen had found the gong belonging to
the place and was striking it

  in the mud fireplace flickered a tiny fire
with food beside it lawton ate and drank
remembered everything he was quite
clear-headed now though weak in body
too weak for any exertion or sudden effort
the sound of the gong had ceased but he
heard thorsens voice from somewhere out-
side rising he pushed aside the mat at
the entrance of his partitioned chamber
and went out to the veranda

  dusk was gathering on the veranda
he saw the two brown men staring up at
him lying there with rifles ready a dozen
feet away out in the open thorsen sat
beside a small fire the gong at his side
speaking in the dyak tongue lawton
saw four shadowy figures gradually steal in
from the edge of the clearing and recog-
nized the skinny old chief with the hair-
tufted shield these were thorsens four
guides and they were very hesitant and
fearful for some reason perhaps those
gongs speaking in the morning from their
own village telling of rifle fire and the de-
struction caused by some unknown white
man had been a bad thing for thorsen
they saw lawton standing on the veranda
and cried out amazedly thorsen looked
around and grinned well he knew that
lawton did not understand the dialect

  there was much rapid speech finally
the four dyaks came to the fire and took the
rockets from thorsen handling them in
much awe until they realized there was no
danger then thorsen fired one previ-
ously prepared and at the hiss and roar
at the wild flight of the starry wonder into
the heavens and the burst of colored lights
the four dyaks dropped everything and
fled with cries of terror

  they returned presently foot by foot
under the persuasion of thorsen being as
much in awe at the appearance of another
white man as at the rocket they had
heard lawtons voice when they arrived
brown kurvenal



with thorsen but they had seen nothing of
him for at sound of his voice they had re-
treated precipitately now they stared
wondering what it all meant thorsen told
them as soon as they hunkered down facing
him

  the people of this long-house have fled
because that white man whom you see
caused them great fear and slew some of
them and drove them into the forest now
take the gong whose voice they will all
recognize and send out to them the message
i will give you

  the four looked at one another they
were still in terror over that streaming spirit
of fire trailing up to heaven yet here
beside them were other such spirits bound
and captive subject to them certainly
they had suffered no scathe and they had
many gifts there in the bundles after all
they could well afford to obey this white
man the old chief looked at his shield
and then looked at thorsens untrimmed
yellow-red hair more red than ever in the
firelight with its decided crinkly wave it
was evident he was thinking how well that
hair would look when set in his shield
thorsen laughed harshly

  try it and i will loose one of those
spirits and let him take you up to the sky
now come to the gong and send the message
i give

  the thin old chief grinned at having his
thoughts read and moved forward he sat
beside the gong on its standard and not
liking the stick thorsen had used took a
heavy striking stick from his waistband
he struck the gong again and again re-
peating this threefold call several times
the shuddering vibrance lifted and eddied
and floated away among the trees this
was doubtless a call to any of the folk within
hearing

  tell them that they may return to their
home tomorrow an hour after sunrise with-
out fear said thorsen

  he was puffing a cigaret comfortably and
darted an ironic glance at the figure of
lawton who did not understand the
gong beat and beat until the chief paused
and thorsen gave more of his message

  say they will find here the men who
have caused them all the trouble and they
may take their heads and afterward they
will have peace one of these is a white
man the other is a malay that is all the
message

  the gong boomed and sang in an irregular
cadence of beats when it was silent thor-
sen gave the old chief a cigaret and rose

  you will come for me here before sunrise
when the sky turns red i and two men
who bear my things will go with you to the
village of the golong people is it well

   it is well said the old chief

  he and his men gathered up their things
and melted into the night thorsen came
up the notched log to the veranda and
laughed at his two men there

  go prepare food and keep quiet he said
in the dyak tongue then turned to law-
ton you saw everythings all right
feeling better

  much thanks

  lawton noted that the two brown men
vanishing inside the long-house had taken
the firearms with them he himself had
been unable to find any weapon except
native ones he could not use a sumpitan
and the spears were heavy

  well have a bite to eat those dyaks
will make some sort of fitter in the morning
to carry you well have to get off think
your malay will be back then

  if hes not ill wait for him said
lawton

  dont be a fool we cant wait its
nip and tuck whether we get out without
a scrap anyhow

  ill wait said lawton

  the other shrugged and fell silent pres-
ently one of the men returned with food and
water fresh roasted meat that put new life
into lawton

  through it all he was not deceived he
had not understood the dyak tongue and
he could not foretell what thorsen intended
but from the moment he was shown that
bag of stones he foresaw his own doom
now he had no doubt the note had been a
trap and thorsen had sent the other dyaks
to kill him he could sense the lies in
thorsen could feel the enveloping air of
deception

  dimly he wondered at it had lawton
been himself he would have laughed at the
other man would have ensnared him in his
lies and then smashed him pitilessly and
without mercy he had intended as much
at the first sign of treachery now he
was helpless and thorsen could crush him
with one hand yet he did not instead
thorsen was falsely bland trying to lull
him into security preparing some devious


adventure

trap such unnecessary care was curious
and rather fascinated lawton at the
same time it gave him a thrill of hope
kurvenal might return and would not be
deceived if only the malay had not
taken his pistol

  the two brown men brought fruit stink-
ing durians and rich mangosteens looking
like cricket balls thorsen ordered them
to stand watch and watch all night warning
them against allowing dyaks to creep in
and stab up between the iron-wood poles of
the flooring lawton knew this watch was
kept against the return of kurvenal as
well and smiled scornfully if the malay
did come he would not walk blindly into
any snare	

  youd better have some quinine said
thorsen when the meal was done ive
got about twenty grains here knock the
fever out of you tonight so youll be first-
chop in the morning ill get it for you

  thorsen rose went into the building
called to the men to bring water a
subtle thrill coursed up lawtons spine a
queer admonitory shiver something wrong
here something wrong thorsens voice
told him as much or had the fever left
him still light-headed feather-brained and
imagining things

  here we are old man thorsen re-
turned with a gourd of water and some
white powder in a folded leaf put it
down then tumble into bed and tomorrow
well be off a good days jaunt will take
us back to the village

  right lawton took the gourd and
leaf packet then turned to the entrance
better lake it the last thing good night
old chap pleasant dreams

  thorsen grunted something inarticulate
he lowered himself to a mat and lighted a
cigaret and stared off into the darkness for
a long while then he stiffened slightly and
tossed away the end of his cigaret and
sat tensed a distant sound was stealing
across the night

  by day there was something eerie about
such a sound here in the savage forest and
hills far from civilization or life the thin
reverberant clangor of those gongs spoke
eloquently of primitive ages when men
hung up a sounding stone and struck it
with a club as may be seen today in the re-
fined jade treasures of china by night
that sound was different it stilled the
squawk of flying foxes and the shriek of

night birds it hushed the forest and hillside
and floated out with tenfold uncanniness
lifting and echoing in a tense clear brazen-
throaled mutter carrying easily over the
miles

  for a little thorsen listened to it frown-
ing wondering what the devil they were
saying from that other long-house perhaps
it was some word to his four dyaks perhaps
not he had no means of knowing per-
haps it had something to do with the rocket
he had sent up with a helpless shrug he
rose at length and went into the long-house

  he came to the room lawton occupied
near the two green jars in which thorsen
took no interest the little fire was flick-
ering out but by it thorsen could see the
empty gourd of water the empty leaf
packet lawton stretched out on his mats
face down to one side was a half-eaten
calabash of rice thorsen looked at the
prostrate man uttered a softly sardonic
laugh and turned away

  no need to bother any more about you
he observed pleasant dreams thats
a good one that is anybody who cant
tell quinine from arsenic ought to have
pleasant dreams

  thorsen turned in and slept

vii

in the grayness of dawn kur-
venal left his four women cap-
tives no longer joined neck and
neck but each with her wrists
securely tethered about the bole of a small
tree and himself stole forward to the edge of
the clearing

  his instinct of caution was that of an
animal but he had definite grounds for it as
well he had heard gongs the previous day
and had heard gongs during the night and
he had four captives to tell him what those
gongs meant it were as well not to inquire
too closely into the persuasion used by
kurvenal for after all he was a malay and
a believer in allah and these captives of his
were but women and infidels mattering
neither in this world nor in the next

  kurvenal wanted the information and he
got it he knew the people of this long-
house would return to it within an hour or
so he knew other dyaks were here who
had sent out the message while some of the
raiders had returned from across the hills
and were scattering out to catch the white
brown kurvenal





men and every one else he knew in
short that his best hope of life and liberty
lay in immediate flight without a moments
pause being otherwise engaged however
he disregarded the danger

  he had thrown away his rifle and now had
only the pistol lawtons pistol he saw
the old dyak chief with the hair-tufted
shield and three other dyaks emerge and go
to the long-house forth from this came
thorsen followed by the two brown men
this showed kurvenal clearly enough that
lawton must be dead yet he had to make
sure he cursed fiercely because of his
lost rifle with the pistol he dared not
risk a shot at thorsen at such a distance
he had left his blow-pipe behind with the
other native weapons he was helpless

  he watched the dyaks the two coast
bearers and thorsen all file off toward the
far side of the clearing toward the runway
leading back to the golong village thor-
sen fingered something bulge in his coat
pocket as he went the eyes of kurvenal
glittered joyfully when he saw that the long-
house was not burned and the burdens of
the men included only food and weapons
he had still a chance of safety he stole
swiftly back to where he had left his cap-
tives uraied their hands hooked them up
by the necks made them take up their bur-
dens of food and the green dragon-stamped
jar and sent them onward to the long-house
in the clearing he himself followed last
it was not yet sunrise

  kurvenal drove his four captives to the
veranda of the long-house and made them
sit down then bound them firmly hand and
foot and gagged them he sent a swift
glance around the clearing saw no one
knew that when they arrived the dyaks
would come slowly and cautiously and so
turned into the long-house he dreaded
what he would find there but went directly
to the place where the two green jars and
lawton had iain

  he drew aside the mat at the opening and
looked in the dim light he saw the two
green jars stripped of their coverings but un-
hurt a half-emptied calabash of rice lay
by the dead fire on the mats lay the figure
of lawton face down

  as allah liveth he is dead muttered
kurvenal tuan tuan lawton

  lawton moved suddenly sat up stared
at him unblinkingly

  you i thought they had come-

  they have gone as lawton rose
the malay surveyed him with that sullen
scowl and nodded good you can
travel i have work to do and a talk to
make when i finish we must go quickly
by the prophet destiny hangs upon a hair
this day here is your pistol again
lawton took the pistol and holster then
he touched with his foot the calabash half
filled with rice

  empty this out that animals may eat it
or birds but let no man touch it

  the malay stooped and gathered up the
calabash curiosity in his eyes he took
it outside and dumped it at the edge of the
rice paddy then he returned to where the
four women sat on the verandah and sev-
ered their bonds

  one take that gong he said pointing
and go sit on the ground and call men to a
talk with me say that i have in my hand
the green jar you brought also the two
green jars that live here one of you go
inside and bring out those two jars and set
all three of them here at the edge of the
verandah so men may see them one of
you go find food for all let none think to
escape lest you die by the devils that fly
flaming in the air

  terrified of him as well they might be
the four women obeyed humbly enough
kurvenal had slept a little during the night
and was fresh he smoked his pipe until
one of the women brought him food law-
ton appeared feeling quite himself and
curious

  you say tuan thorsen has gone

  he went before dawn with your two
men and four dyak warriors kurvenal
devoted himself to the food and pointed
eat you will have need of it

  lawton sat down he asked no ques-
tions though curiosity filled him one of
the women was beating the gong intermit-
tently while the three green jars empty and
gleaming in the light stood above the
notched log the sun was not yet over the
trees but level beams pierced these and
touched everything with dancing gilded
finger tips

  where did you throw the rice

  behind by the paddy said kurvenal
you supposed i had left you

  no why should i

  the malays eyes gleamed a little he
was gratified by lawtons simple trust

i thought myself a fool for not leaving


adventure

you and going when i heard what those
gongs had said he observed reflectively
but now as allah liveth i am not so sure
dishonored life is not sweet and is ill-nour-
ished irving honor and life man fights
you must fight tuan thorsen when we
reach the golong village we shall not be
far behind him or at least you will not

  and you asked lawton brows going
up in surprize the malay shook his head

  is not the fate of man known to god
alone

  more than this he refused to say and
fell into sullen silence lawton rose pres-
ently and looked out toward the rice paddy
and saw a great hornbill lying dead there
he shook his head at sight of the bird and
smiled a little

  arsenic or quinine well no matter
i shall settle with thorsen tonight if all
goes well except for this arsenic trick id
let him go now i shall kill him

  he came back to the veranda he found
kurvenal and all four captive women now
sitting out in the open waiting and from
three points in the forest wall men were
slowly coming forward converging upon the
group these were all warriors kurvenal
looked up at the white man and spoke in
malay swiftly

  stay there tuan let them see your
pistol threaten not them but the jars

  lawton understood now and smiled
softly

  the warriors came forward a score and
more sumpitans ready with poison shafts
in place arrows on string knives out some
recognized the malay all saw lawton
standing over the jars the weapons were
gradually put away now kurvenal began
to speak and lawton could easily guess the
drift of his speech from the reactions of the
dyaks their frightened glances these
men would have laughed at threats directed
at them but it was their precious and brittle
wealth standing in peril their dragon-
marked gods their jars of antiquity im-
memorable

  lighting his little pipe and speaking very
calmly kurvenal told of having satisfied
his vengeance as they could well under-
stand and described the power of the devils
who aided him and the white mans devils
by whose aid he had captured the three
green jars they could understand this
too he had intended to destroy the jars
and would still do it at the fust hostile

  movement otherwise they could have
the captive women back and the jars also
at a price

  one of the chiefs made answer to this
and spoke anxiously for the safety of the
jars he would buy them gladly but the
women were of little importance kur-
venal nodded to this and demanded a litter
for the white man fresh meat an escort of
six warriors and other men to carry the
jars and fitter

  one bullet will destroy all three he
said if we reach the golong village in
safety you may take away the jars if we
meet with trouble on the way i destroy the
jars the answer is in your hands

  the terms were accepted instantly the
warriors laid aside their weapons and sent
calls into the forest women appeared and
old men children not a few coming forward
kurvenal had the jars lifted out into the
open and stood over them with lawtons
pistol lawton protested that he could
travel afoot but the malay only smiled
grimly

  nay tuan we must make speed to
reach the village ere dark and you must
not reach there weary and exhausted for
when we get there you will fight tuan
thorsen

true i shall kill him said lawton
did you notice the chief who was with
him tuan asked the malay an old
man thin with fine weapons he of the
shield tufted with human hair

  yes

  when i was a slave that chief owned me
i want to meet with him again by the
koran the book of blessings i shall make
him eat of his own flesh before i kill him
we go to a hot vengeance tuan

  there was little time lost for the dyaks
were cheerful very eager to get rid of tliese
strangers and very eager to earn back their
precious ancient jars a long message was
sent out on the gong and women made
ready a plaited hammock and the three
green jars were very solicitiously wrapped
in mats and green rattans against the jour-
ney the hammock was thickened with
more mats and was slung on a long pole
and all was ready

  now kurvenal came to lawton

  all is prepared tuan i will keep your
pistol a little while until we get to the vil-
lage fear not these men will not hurt
you while i am behind those jars but i
brown kurvenal



see you are not afraid have i done all
things to your liking tuan

  yes said lawton curious why
do you ask it is not your habit to care
overmuch

  true said the other but you have
given me an ancient and honorable galar a
name of manhood greater and older than
other names and i desire to make it good in
your eyes allah further you will you
get in

  lawton got into the hammock it drew
tight and most uncomfortable but at least
saved his strength he wondered at the
singular spirit of this dark malay and
smiled to himself at thought of what a
name had accomplished yet there was no
amusement in his smile he divined some-
thing piteous and groping in the man
something indeed akin to that other and
more ancient kurvenal and he thought
about it until he fell asleep to the swing of
the hammock

vih

half an hour before sunset an
hour or less before darkness

  the village was a scant quarter-
mile away and kurvenal halted his
dyaks two men from the village had met
them and were now standing watching fear-
ful marveling lawton got out of his
hammock and kurvenal spoke to him
curtly

  go to the village with those two men
i must wait here until you are safe these
infidel dogs would yet take our heads if they
dared take the pistol for i have a knife
and a club

  lawton took the pistol the malay
stood over the three green jars knife in one
hand and club in the other

  can we not go together

  no they would like a white head
if thorsen is there slay him i shall come
quickly

  lawton glanced at the squatting dyaks
and it seemed to him obvious that they
would not risk their precious green jars at
the last moment he turned motioned to
the two men from the golong village and
strode down the runway there would be
no surprizing thorsen he knew dramat-
ics would be all very nice but they seldom
came to pass in real life and by this time
the whole story of kurvenal and the green

jars and their recovery would be bruited all
over dyak land gongs must have been
busy that day no it would be a straight
walk-in and resort to bullets between him
and thorsen

  the village opened out lawton strode
grimly on among the scattered houses look-
ing to right and left for thorsen his two
men his four dyaks he saw nothing of
them the people greeted him without
astonishment emotionless grave in their
bearing it was hard for him to realize
that he had been away only days not weeks
presently he came to the long-house given
over to him and thorsen he saw their
men grouped about the entrance heard their
cried of greeting and delight

  where is tuan thorsen he demanded
since they understood malay

  they looked blank

  he has not returned tuan is he not
with you

  presently kurvenal came running eager-
ness in his scowling face his white teeth
flashing as he ran he had got away from
the dyaks easily enough after all since they
wanted only to take their green jars and go
he broke into a storm of speech and lawton
was forced to realize that the incredible
was true his own bearers the village
chiefs all told the same tale all showed the
same surprize at kurvenals insistent que-
ries thorsen and his party had not come
and had not been heard from

  hunting accidents of the trail parleys-
there were a dozen things to explain thor-
sens delay and yet none of them satisfied
lawton kurvenal he could see was wor-
ried the malay said nothing but sat
in sullen silence that night the chiefs
came and talked many folk wanted to
trade there was hard camphor waiting
and some gold dust and other things were
coming lawton told them that he would
trade for everything on the morrow so the
gongs sent out this message to the jungle
dyaks and the long-houses down the river
telling of the palaver and trade that would
take place on the morrow

   it seemed a trifling incident this message
of trade clanging out and yet upon it hung
life and death-aye and fortune

  the night passed uneventfully with
morning lawton was more himself bathed
and shaved and dressed in fresh garments
strength was rapidly coming back to him
and all his old alertness of brain still no


adventure

sign of thorsen the three men and the
four dyaks had dropped from sight

  all that morning lawton hung upon sus-
pense waited tensely thinking every mo-
ment to see the yellow hair of thorsen
blinking in the sunlight through kur-
venal he did a great deal of trading many
folk having come in and toward noon he
suspended all business until later in the
day at his request the village chiefs sent
out men to watch for thorsens approach

  after the noon meal lawton went to
sleep he was wakened two hours later
by kurvenal and sat up hastily

  tuan thorsen he has jome

  the malay shook his head yet his dark
eyes gleamed with singular fires

  no tuan two hill dyaks have come
in to trade

  tell them to wait until morning
kurvenal ignored the order from be-
neath his sarong he took an object and let it
fall on the mat leside lawton

  they brought this to trade tuan
lawton picked up the leathern bag and
suddenly recognized it here in his hand
was the very bag thorsen had displayed to
him the bag holding rough diamonds and
sapphires no need to open it lawtons
fingers could feel the stones under the
leather

  a trick he exclaimed and came to his
feet buckling on his belt and holster then
opening the holster so that he could get at
the automatic easily this is a bag thorsen
showed me here is a trick to see if lam
in the village

  allah -done knows said the malay
gravely come and look at those two
dyaks

  lawton followed him swiftly outside
in the clearing quite alone and for some
reason avoided by the village folk sat two
hill men squatted over their weapons they
stared up at lawton in stupefaction they
had not expected to see him here of all men

  and on his part lawton stopped short
returning the stare one of the pair was a
lithe warrior the other was a chief a thin
man old yet stalwart bearing very hand-
some weapons at his side a rectangular
shield tufted with human hair the chief
who had been with thorsen

  afterward lawton realized just how
singular his action was he had fully
determined to kill thorsen a treacherous

and murderous scoundrel and to kill him
without pity now it came to him like a
shock that thorsen was a white man after
all had been his comrade there was
something deep and terrible rising in him
compelling his hand almost without his own
volition so that he snatched suddenly at his
pistol

   it was all swift in the flash of an instant
lawton fired just as the old chief was
rising and fired to kill the bullet swept
the dyak off his feel hurled him backward
and dropped him in a crumpled heap dead
the second warrior had already seized his
strung bow he twanged the string and
again two shafts in the sunlight lawton
felt himself shoved violently knew one
shaft barely missed him he saw kurvenal
whirl around and fall wordless then he
shot the second dyak so swift had it all
been between two bullets

  the violent tumult and commotion in the
village subsided there was nothing to
fear in the sunlight stood lawton un-
hurt beside the body of the malay and out
in front of him lay the two dead dyaks all
the village understood perfectly why those
api gujong men had thus been slain it
was well done

  lawton dropped his weapon and knelt
turned over the shaggy malay for one
moment he found those dark eyes meeting
his and an unwonted smile touched the
brown face

  the name-of honor tuan said kur-
venal and died that instant

  quietly lawton let the limp clay down to
the dust again and rose he understood
everything now-why thorsen had not
come what had detained him everything
he walked over to where the dyak chief
lay crumpled up across his own shield and
with his foot kicked the thin aged body
aside in this action showed lawtons
real self for a moment it was a callous
thing to do perhaps thus to kick away the
dead shell of a man

  the shield on which the chief had fallen
lay blood-spotted in the sunlight tufted
with human hair all that hair was not
dark however some hair had been freshly
added the skin pressed in tighdy among the
rattan withes of the shield and this
newly added hair was a rich golden shade
a ruddy yellow crinkled and a little curly

  lawton turned away
ld man cal rhodes staggered
under a smashing blow in the
mouth shaking his grizzled head
in a vain attempt to clear his sight
so that he might yet pound the bloody face
that loomed before him but he was done
for that last crushing blow had broken
him and he sank slowly to his hands and
knees in the soft damp soil little old man
knight swayed on his feet gazing vacantly
down on his larger foe it had been a bit-
ter bitter fight-the result of an old quar-
rel between these backwoods neighbors-
and contrary to local custom they had
fought it out clean old man tom had
said quietly-

  no guns or knives cal

  and cal had agreed mrs tom had
watched old tom go down to the field
with many misgivings calling after him
he aint to be trusted tom that
cracker aint and sides hes biggern you
better take yore pistol god made guns
and knives to make all men the same size
but efn yall cant fight like gentlemen but
has to use yore fists why dont come home
lessn ye whip him old tom had just
shaken his head and now as he looked
down on his enemy he spoke again quietly
through his battered bleeding ups

  i whipped ye fair cal and ye know i
did but ye fowt well lets call it quits
old man cal raised his head with a great
effort for a moment his lips moved with
no sound and his swollen eyes burned with
a savage hate then

  all right tom ye whipped me fair
let the har go with the hide

haope

dawdm

not

   they shook hands and little old tom
 picked up his coat and walked slowly off
 toward his cabin under the big live oaks
 for a long time thereafter cal rhodes sat
 staring off to the west across the bare field
 and the charred pine stumps

   the preacher leaned across the pulpit in
 his earnestness that bright sunday morning
  the heart is deceitful and wicked above
 all things who can know it thats my
 text friends and ye all know its true i
 dont know whats in yore heart and you
 dont know whats in mine god knows
 and sees may he find no malice in any of
 our hearts this mornin if yell turn to-
 and calvin rhodes with unhearing ears
 gazed beneath shaggy brows at old tom
 in the pew across devising a way-devising
 a way

   two years passed old man cal paused
 in his plowing and again stared out across
 the little field again he saw himself
 beaten whipped by a smaller man in a fair
 fight and he spoke aloud

   ill have revenge on ye tom knight

 -ye ifn its the last thing i ever do i

 hate the sight of ye i hate yore name
 from far away toward the cypress swamp
 came the distant cry of a hound cal
  rhodes stopped the hounds baying was
 growing steadily nearer and the old man
 forgot his grudge

   by jingo thats zeb allisons rowdy
 and hes a-bringin a deer out across the
 ridge as sure as im a foot high

   there was no time to go to his own house
 for a gun and he bethought himself of the
 knight cabin

ioi


 adventure

  ill get tonis the old- might as

well let him think im peaceable like til i
get my chance

  he arrived at his neighbors out of breath
mrs tom met him at the door

  why howdy cal come in she beamed
shore glad yeve decided to let bygones be
bygones toms down to the mill house
a-grindin cane

  cant come in thank ye maam panted
old man cal jes wanted to borrow toms

and i thought maybe as how i could cut
him off

  shore agreed mrs tom here it is
a-settin behind the door hope you git the
deer and efn ye do bring us a quarter as
were plumb out o meat

  old man cal noticed that the gun was
loaded as he ran when he reached the
hog-pasture gate rowdy and the deer had
passed and he sat down on a log to get
his breath

  might ha knowed i couldnt a killed
nothin with his gun anyway the old
skunk he exploded his failure to get a
shot fanning his hatred

  a sudden idea seized him he rested a
few minutes and then returned to the field
where he unhitched his mules and started up
the lane to his own cabin arrived there he
went to a cupboard and took down his old
xwder horn and pouch of shot craftily
he peered from the window to be sure that
no one watched

  an hour or two later the gun stood in its
place behind the door and cal rhodes
shifted uneasily on his feet as he said

  no maam i didnt git thar in time
thank yall anyway

 spring came old man tom plowed
his corn and played in the evenings to little
tom on his banjo and calvin hearing
little toms whoops of pleasure at the old
darky song would shake his fist in the
direction of the sound and go inside wnar
i dont have to listen to the old skunks
voice

  a lank cracker boy on an ancient moth-
eaten mule pulled up in front of cals
cabin

  heard the news he shouted to old
man cal who was coming up the lane from
feeding his hogs tom knight dropped
dead this evenin-jes all of a sudden
heart failure i reckon

  what screamed old cal it cant be

-it mustnt be i dont believe it i-

  the cracker boy addressed the group in
front of the post office

  i never see the like of the way the old
man rhodes carried on when i tol him
why he must have actually got to love
mister knight he shore did take on
they buried old tom knight from the
little backwoods church calvin rhodes
by request of the knight family served as
pall bearer with his last look at old
toms weatherbeaten face now so still and
white he cursed silently at the fate that had
robbed him of his revenge and went home
to brood alone death had cheated him
there was nothing he could do

       a year passed little tom

         shouldered the farming valiantly
and the widow knight as be-
fitted her heroic breed took up
the lighter chores old cal tilled his little
field it could be seen that he had aged
from his stooping shoulders and the way he
would absently stop in his plowing to
stare vacantly into thin air came another
fall from far across the ridge floated the
faint quivering cry of an old hound calvin
rhodes heard and shouted to little tom in
the next field

  get yore gun son and come a-runnin
that old pieded dog o zebs a-comin with
a deer little tom came a-runnin
eyes bright with excitement

  hurry up mister rhodes hell cross
by the hog-pasture gate he puffed handing
the old muzzle loader to cal old cal hur-
ried as best he could and together they
crouched in a pine thicket it might have
been the same buck that broke again into
the clearing-old cal fired-

the preacher drew a large hand-
kerchief from his shabby coat

  friends he said were here
today to pay respect to our beloved
brother calvin wetherbee rhodes he
was a good and kind man with malice
toward none his death is a great loss to
our little community his was a noble
forgiving spirit may we all learn from him
the spirit of forgiveness

  and little tom in his fathers seat
sniffled softly and whispered-

  pore mister rhodes- i shore wonder
what made that gun sound so uncommon
loud and bust thataway
  iln the sixteenth century when
  according to the solemn pro-
  nouncement of the lord chief

- justice of england the killing

of an irishman was not a legal crime the
flower of irelands manhood took flight to
the continent to escape bitter persecution
for a full three centuries that flight held
and historians gave it the colorful name of
the flight of the irish wild geese its
penniless adventurers either died on the
field of battle under alien flags or lived to
garner fame as admirals ambassadors field
marshals scholars or physicians in every
court of europe

  it was not until the dose of the seven-
teeth century however that the first of the
proud clan of the dillons spread his rebel-
lious pinions and winged eastward to the
sanctuary of hospitable france another
dillon it was who led his regiment of the
mad irish brigade at fontenoy in  a
celtic cross marks the high tide of that bat-
tle where his impetuous onslaught turned
a french disaster into a glorious victory
when news of it came to king george it
wrought from him the cry-

  accursed be the laws that deprive us of
such subjects

  clare dillon one and a half centuries
after his kinsman had rendered that great
service to france rode along the crude high-
way that after crossing four mountain
ranges from cape haitien on the north
skirts the sea to haitis capital on the
south there were but three gold louis in
his purse but as he caught the glint of the
blazing september sun on the roofs of port-

au-prince the gay chorus of a parisian
music-hall ballad was on his lips on the
white road a cloud of dust appeared that
moved steadily towards him wild high-
pitched cries marked its advance the
market-women frantically urged their heav-
ily burdened donkeys to the edge of the
road and no longer flung back to him their
soft-voiced bon jour bon papa to his
cheery greetings

  vive le president vive general charle-
magne the cries took form

  abreast of the arche de triomphe on the
outskirts of the capital shabby and un-
kempt where tropical suns and tropical
rains had flaked off patches of paint and
left it the bare and leprous mockery of an
arch clare dillon reined in his native pony

  on came the column of dust ragged
barefooted peasants capered before it with
simian antics and shrilled incessantly at the
top of their lungs the sun struck blinding
shafts of silver against the drawn sabers of
the mounted escort in its midst the black
ruler of haiti slouched in an open victia
now and then his hands jerked upwards
a shower of sous and centimes danced in
the sun and the half-starved peasants flung
themselves recklessly under the hoofs of
the mounted escort and fought for them

  clare dillon watched the bizarre specta-
cle with eyes that danced with merriment
he had landed in the north six months be-
fore and this was his first glimpse of the
capital in the primitive interior he had
heard weird tales of the giant strength of
president charlemange in a country where
few were strong of his implacable cruelty to

adventure

his foes and princely generosity to his favor-
ites his secret worship of the sinister voo-
doo cult the amazing contradictions of the
palace life over which he ruled with iron
hand

  he singled him out a giant black in
cocked hat tunic of vivid crimson with
triple row of decorations and orders epau-
lettes and broad sash of gold lace and at
the same moment his keen sea-blue eyes
were caught by a sinister contrast a peas-
ant whose shirt hung in ribbons on a gaunt
emaciated frame was stealthily edging his
way through the turbulent crowd that
hemmed in the victoria a bare machete
swung in short menacing strokes at his side

  clare dillon struck his spurs into the
flank of his native pony straight for that
sinister figure he rode one of the guards
galvanized into panicky action leveled his
pistol a bullet tore through his sleeve and
burned like the searing edge of a lance
thrust straight on he held his startled
pony and the peasants broke before him in
panic

  the gaunt peasant profiting by this
diversion had swung his machete upwards
clare dillons right hand froze about the
uplifted wrist and twisted it with a grip of
steel the machete clattered on the road
and the ragged black stood dazed at the
side of the victoria his right arm hung
limp at his side broken above the wrist
with the quickness of a panther for all his
bulk president charlemagne was on his
feet and whipped his heavy saber out from
its scabbard the would-be assassin fell
under its blow like a stricken ox his head
split in two as a man would cleave a coco-
nut above the mad tumult he lifted his
booming voice in passable french

   monsieur it seems that i owe my life to
your quick wit these slovenly guards of
min sleep while they ride your name
monsieur

  clare dillon at your service monsieur
le president i come from mirabelais
where i was lately engaged in the logwood
business

  a wry smile creased the otherwise mask-
like face the black eyes gleamed sardon-
ically for a brief second then went lifeless
as though carved of black obsidian flint

  the business of logwood can hold little
promise to you monsieur dillon i have
need of white men of your strength and wit
you will be in the capital for a while

  i have come in search of employment
and with letters to monsieur gaston leroy
from mutual friends in paris

   ah a sudden glint of interest flickered
in charlemagnes eyes my compliments
to gaston leroy have him escort you to
the palace in the morning and i will receive
you after the parade of my palace guard
au revoir

  the motley cavalcade rattled on out
from the fringe of the awed crowd a peas-
ant woman crept and knelt in dumb de-
spair over the dead body at the side of the
road a gold louis spun in the air and fell at
her feet clare dillon rode on his left arm
wet with the trickle of blood and his re-
maining fortune the less by one-third the
music-hall chorus was back on his lips

  it had always been thus with the breed
of the irish wild geese

when the maddest of his
pranks had cost clare dillon his
commission in the french navy
it was more than sudden caprice
that had turned his wings to haiti of all
the dillon tradition he had treasured most
the story of colonel odonnell dillon the
soldier ancestor who had been as brilliant
in the field as he was gay and debonnair in
the court of the great napoleon

  colonel dillon had sailed overseas with
general le clerc son-in-law of napoleon
in that futile and tragic campaign whose
objective was to save to france the richest
gem of her colonial empire the island of
haiti yellow fever had claimed him as its
victim along with thousands of napoleons
veterans

  clare dillon had sailed with brave
dreams he had pictured himself as the
lord of a plantation whose acres would be
white with cotton and aromatic with the
flavor of the coffee berries that had such
vogue in france

  there he would live in feudal splendor
served by an arm of black retainers until
he had accumulated a fortune and then-
paris a fortnight in haiti had erased the
brave dreams he had found that in all its
ten thousand of square miles there was not
a plantauon that the garden of the tuileries
could not have held that its cotton and cof-
fee grew semi-wild along its ruined roads
and in its uncared-for fields the logwood
boom was at a sensational height when he
landed at cape haitien and he had
breed of the wild geese



invested all his money in it out in the log-
wood areas of the north he had worked like
a galley slave lived the primitive life of the
hills and had seen the deflated boom wipe
out his last hundred louis yet he had two
gold louis the haunting memory of a music-
hall ballad and the unconquerable gaiety
of his race

  he found gaston leroys house on the
slope of the rampart of hills that rose from
the sea from its wide verandas stretched
an incomparable panorama of beauty in the
great semi-circle of the bay the green of the
hills the glory of the tropical skies

  the wound in his arm had proved to be
but a scratch a plunge into the outdoor
swimming pool into which cold water from
the hills flowed all day long an admirable
dinner and a choice wine had worked their
magic he spoke impulsively-

  tell me my dear friend what can i find
to do here

  slim and elegant of figure with snow-
white mustache and imperial that lent dig-
nity to hooded black eyes and aquiline
nose monsieur leroy might well have been
a court gallant of the second empire it is
to his credit that he was as fiercely proud of
his haitian blood as he was of his french
a patriot in a black republic that teemed
with graft and intrigue gaston leroy was
a unique product

  you were but lately an officer of the
french navy

  yes and i would be one now but for the
foolish remark of a young british guards-
man on leave in paris answered clare
dillon

  he toyed with the long stem of his wine
glass for a moment before he went on

  i saw fit to dash a glass of just such ex-
cellent wine into the face of that young
guardsman he had spoken slightingly of
a young irish actress who was then the toast
of paris true i had met her but once
for ail i know she may have been the light
of love that his careless remark painted
but she was a beautiful woman and an
irish one at that of course there was a
duel the next morning and i wounded him
in his sword arm before it had barely begun

  all would have been well had not a
stupid minister of marine published but the
week before a drastic order forbidding the
honorable practice of dueling i had to re-
sign or face a court martial and the notori-
ety of that duel might have been distasteful

to the young lady so here i am the pen-
niless scion of a long line of soldiers and sail-
ors and as helpless in business as any babe
he laughed softly and with him gaston
leroy such a youth was dear to the ro-
mantic leroy

  you did what any french gentleman
would have done the older man hastened
to assure him today you did my presi-
dent a signal service already you have
shed your blood for haiti and i in all my
fifty years have not done that and now
he dropped his voice to a discreet pitch i
shall speak quite as frankly for i know you
will honor my confidence

  to my friends monsieur dillon he
went calmly on i am a haitian gentleman
of french descent who makes a comfortable
living as a shipper of coffee to havre to
president charlemagne and a trusted few i
am the chief of his secret service you can
well understand that with his life in daily
jeopardy of the knife or the secret poisons
his enemies brew in the hills it is vital that
i should keep my true position a secret
the blue eyes that always held a smile
were now glowing in a twinkling clare
dillon had found himself on the threshold
of the adventure that was salt to his life
revolutions plots and counter-plots the
mystery of the hills and jungles of this land
that held so much mystery and tragedy
were jogging his elbow

  i will be greatly surprized my dear
friend said gaston leroy if president
charlemagne does not find tomorrow good
use for your courage and training even
now in the north from which you came
nord alexandre is plotting to put himself
at the head of a new revolution his agents
are in our midst the tenure of our rulers is
precarious at the best and nord alexandre
is a black tiger

  but one of our long line of emperors
kings and presidents has lived to serve out
his term of office in our hundred years of
history you can do much to help me make
charlemagne the second exception mon-
sieur i offer you a toast to the health of
the president and to la belle france

the sun was blazing pitilessly
down on the dusty sliadelcss
champ de mars the next morn-
ing as the two men watched the
review of the palace guard by its black
ruler barefooted clad in heavy woolen
io

adventure

uniforms of blue and red the guard swung
past them clare dillons practised eyes
watched them with a wonder that he found
hard to conceal some were armed with
modern french carbines others with ger-
man mausers still others with ancient flint-
locks one in the front rank proudly shoul-
dered the stock of an old musket while his
covering file grasped its lock and barrel

  brutish of face a company of yokels in
ill-fitting uniforms they shambled along
while the gorgeously appareled band played
the stirring strains of uie haitian national
air la dessalines

  the review at an end they approached
charlemagne who towered above all on the
field save the young frenchman

  ah monsieur dillon tell me in all
your european experience have you ever
seen soldiers to compare with mine
boomed charlemagne

  never have i seen their like monsieur
le president was the truthful answer

  gaston leroy coughed discreetly

  you hear my friends

  charlemagne turned with a dramatic
sweep of his arm to the group of gaudily
uniformed officers it was clearly evident
that the ready answer of this young french-
man who had but the day before saved the
life of their chief had made a happy im-
pression

  all of the capitals society and its diplo-
matic set were present when the two en-
tered the reception room of the palace in
the wake of the presidential party the
men were in uniform for the greater part
the rest in evening dress necklaces of
pearls and diamonds flashed on the bosoms
of the women clare dillon saw that many
were as fair as the women of any european
court regardless of their color they had in
common the native graces of france the
frocks and tongue of france and all its
gaiety of speech

  of all the women there was one of a dark
and piquant beauty whom he singled out
of that amazing gathering gaston leroy
caught the target on which his roving eye
had rested

  you must meet madame eckermann
my friend she is an austrian the wife of
the richest german in the island he is a
prussian pig and a most detestable one but
you will find her charming

  it was clare dillons first meeting with a
white woman in haiti and his spirits soared

to her gay badinage he was oblivious to
all but the mischievous play of madame
eckermanns black eyes and the charm of
her brunette beauty when a stiff ramrod of
a man joined them

  my husband monsieur dillon the
young gentleman who saved the presidents
life yesterday she presented him

  clare dillon on the instant found him as
distasteful as he had found her adorable
cold gray eyes that had in them the cruel
play of knives stiff pompadour of a sandy
hue a squarely shaped head on burly shoul-
ders in short to the young frenchman he
was the perfect type of prussian that he
instinctively disliked with all the vigor of
his gallic blood herr eckermann bowed
stiffly and murmured his compliments in a
guttural french that bore a curious lisp

  as she moved away on her husbands arm
madame eckermann said over her shoulder

  i am at home to my friends always on
fridays at five monsieur dillon

  this time the duel of blue eyes and black
was of far different import

  as the reception drew to its end an aide-
de-camp bore clare dillon off with much
ceremony from the knot of haitians who
voluble with repeated drafts of champagne
were exchanging lively rallies with him
charlemagne came straight to the point
when the aide bowed himself out of the pri-
vate suite

  monsieur dillon hector charlemagne
does not forget those who do him service
nor- and the black flinty eyes struck with
sudden fire-does he spare his enemies
only a week ago the admiral of my fleet
stripped of his insignia of rank paid the
penalty for treason before a firing squad
monsieur i offer you the command you
will have the rank and pay of the highest
admiral in frances navy your answer
monsieur

  had he stopped to analyze his impressions
of what he had seen and heard of either
branch of the haitian service clare dillon
might have declined the surprizing offer
but he was a sailor and here was a navy
that he could mold and shape to his hearts
desire he was a fighter by inheritance and
instinct and haiti was a cockpit of peren-
nial revolutions he was penniless and the
post carried emoluments far beyond his
most sanguine dreams that day too a
pair of black eyes had intrigued him im-
mensely but above and beyond all he
breed of the wild geese



was of the breed of the irish wild geese
and his hand shot up in smart salute

  monsieur le president i am proud
to accept the command with which you
honor me

  bienl i have need of you admiral dil-
lon our friend gaston leroy will make
you acquainted with the state of the fleet
he will make all the arrangements in my
name au revoirl

  as he passed down the alace steps into
the blinding white heat the picture of the
only haitian man-o-war that he had seen
flashed before his mind she was a slat-
ternly gunboat at anchor off cape haitien
the day he made that port a draggle-tail
of a vessel she was an affront to his sailors
eyes a stench in his nostrils

  low in the scales as the haitian army
was honeycombed with graft and incom-
petency he knew that navy ranked im-
measurably below it yet his eyes were
smiling and the gay chorus of the music-
hall ballad was on his lips for all that was to
be changed if youth and the traditions of
the french navy counted for aught

        those were hectic days that
followed for the haitian navy
in truth was a corpse to be gal-
vanized into life in all a squad-
ron of four gunboats obsolete waifs of
england and france it had been bought
by corrupt agents who had made a pretty
penny with their juggled accounts so far
its only service had been in the transport of
ragged troops to coastwise destinations and
in ineffective blockades at which the gun-
runners thumbed their noses

  its machinery was decrepit its bottoms
and hulls foul its rigging disreputable its
batteries lacked breech-plugs or sights and
its ammunition was generally defective
its sullen half-starved crews were on the
point of mutiny easy targets for the over-
tures of the revolutionary agents

  charlemagnes summary shooting or exile
of its ranking officers had removed a danger-
ous factor but when admiral dillon broke
out his four-starred flag on the flagship the
crelc-a-picrrot his squadron was at its low-
est ebb of morale and efficiency

  guided by gaston leroy he worked like
a pirate captain of old to remedy the ruin
that he found from obscure warehouses
he daily unearthed tons of supplies ord-
nance and equipment that were restiug there

until they could have een sold to the first
bidder from six bells in the morning until
eight bells in the afternoon he drove his offi-
cers and men to the limit of their endurance
and spared himself the least of all it was a
herculean task and back of it lay the lash
of the menace of the revolution that was
fast shaping in the hills

  it went forward under untoward handi-
caps that often were sinister a heavy
block crashed down from the upper rigging
on the very day he took command and
missed him by a foot a sharp-edged mar-
linspike lodged in the deck at his feet two
days later and when he stepped ashore that
night a pistol shot sang past his ears the
after gangway of the flagship carried away
one morning as he set his foot on it and
plunged him into harbor waters where tri-
angular fins cruised eternally in the quest
of food

  it was a full fortnight before the secret
agents that gaston leroy had placed on
each of the ships as petty officers could by
the judicious plying of the fiery native rum
ferret out the barefooted malcontents who
were acting as the tools of nord alexandre

  one by one they paid the penalty before
the firing squad at dawn on the mud flats of
dessalines field

  yet for all the success of the agents they
could not trace the mischief back to the
central head who was working in the dark
for nord alexandre his tools were too il-
literate too inarticulate to be of service in
that direction the ragged volleys of the
firing squad that now followed swift on the
heels of every act of sabotage however
cleansed the once ragged crews as effectively
as paint and water had regenerated the
ships

  then came the day when the squadron
steamed out of port-au-prince in well-or-
dered column for a shakedown cruise to mole
st nicholas to the north at ten knots it
steamed without breakdown of machinery
and without mishap along those sea-leagues
of the notoriously poorly lighted coast un-
til it dropped anchor in the bay where once
the navies of great britain france and
spain had in their turn ridden

  boat drill the landing of armed parties
on the sandy beaches the crack of mauser
rifles  the improvised ranges and end-
less inspections filled the fortnight there
then blundering sadly at first the squadron
steamed back to its base maneuvering from
io

adventure

line into column from cruising formation
into battle approach with the four-inch
guns and the six-pounders blazing away in
target practise at the battered hulks that
lined the coast until even its admiral
beamed genially on the crews that now
adored him as their gros mane chef

  the sun was setting in gorgeous pag-
eantry of color on the isle of gonave that
lies athwart the entrance to port-au-prince
bay when the squadron steamed decor-
ously in and came smartly to anchor the
saluting battery of the crete-a-pierrot barked
out the national salute to the coal-black
ruler of the black republic as admiral
dillon went over the side to the shrill pip-
ing of the boatswains mate he recalled that
it was friday and that on friday madame
eckermann was at home to her friends
at five

  he had found time before the squadrons
departure despite those days of feverish
preparation to enter into the social gaiety
of the capital with infinite tact the born
gift of camaraderie and unquenchable
spirits he had already taken his place in it
as befitted his exalted rank and the prestige
of his years in france

  despite the fact that charlemagne was a
black there were few of his color whose
social aspirations could win an entree into
the gay parties that found the cercle belle-
vue the maison leroy or the home of
madame eckermann their favorite rallying
grounds

  of that small circle of whites the diplo-
matic set and those of the haitians who
were of european descent herr eckermann
so clare dillon had early found was rarely
present business trips along the coast and
into the interior in the interests of the ger-
man banking firm that he represented
meant prolonged absences the roads were
but trails passable only by horse in the dry
reasons and the coastwise vessels were few
and far between

  already clare dillon entertained a shrewd
suspicion as to the true nature of many of
those trips but he had shrugged his shoul-
ders with true gallic indifference and his
growing intimacy with the charming aus-
trian wife of the german banker soon be-
came the talk of the capital

  his call the afternoon on which the
squadron returned however proved to be
his last for several days there were long
and secret conferences at the palace between

himself charlemagne and leroy and other
unavoidable happenings that he could not
control a full fortnight of this held and it
was then that madame eckermann piqued
beyond endurance by his seeming neglect
took the field

  he was busily scanning the charts of the
harbors on the western coast in the cabin of
his flagship late one afternoon preparatory
to a plan of blockade in the event of nord
alexandres declaration of war when ma-
dame eckermann appeared unannounced
at his door

  it was a daringly unconventional thing
for a woman in haiti to do and both knew
how the tongues would wag ashore there
was no evidence of surprize however in the
graciousness of his welcome boredom had
seized him that afternoon and thoughts of
the pretty austrian had more than once
slowed up his work he was in the mood for
merry prattle over a glass of iced cham-
pagne and the welcome of his sea-blue eyes
speedily quieted her evident perturbation

  she had ceased her charming chiding of
his neglect and was in the midst of the
piquant story of the last dance at the cercle
bellevue when the cabin darkened as
though a blanket had dropped over the open
air ports a gust of cold wind shot through
a great drop of water splashed through one
of the open ports thunder crashed like a
salvo of big guns across the darkening sky
stabbed the blinding flash of tropical light-
ning

clare dillon hastily placed
his half-emptied glass of cham-
pagne on the table apologized
and raced up on deck back of
the rugged slopes of fort nationale a huge
black cloud had formed beyond those
slopes lay the broad acres of the plain of the
cul-de-sac a storm barometer that never
proved derelict was fort nationale when
shrouded in cloud he knew that across the
dusty plain at its back a tropical storm was
driving with the speed of a torpedo toward
the capital

  not until dawn did that tropical storm
with sheets of rain lashing against the flag-
ship in relentless fury with appalling thun-
der and terrifying flashes of lightning give
up its mastery

  in the cabin a frantic distraught woman
cowered and wailed stricken by the drama
that the storm held for her panicky with
breed of the wild geese



fear of that night of mad storm and the fury
that herr eckermann would visit upon her

  on the quarterdeck of the crete-a-pierrot
admiral clare dillon paced at dawn with
steady tread his gig was rounding up to
the starboard gangway and he turned to go
below for madame eckermann when he saw
a disreputable shore boat coming alongside
in its stem sheets was herr eckermann
crouched as though to spring aboard the
moment his craft touched the gangway
with a curt order to the officer of the deck
not to allow any one on board until he gave
the order he went below

  oh he will kill us both clare gasped
madame eckermann

  i think not was the cool answer
certainly i was not born to die at the
hands of such a prussian pig as for you
my dear you are far too charming for such
a fate come my dear you must meet him
with your head up a word from you if he
dares to lay his hands on you for this most
unfortunate accident and i have knowledge
enough of his mysterious trips from the cap-
ital to give herr eckermann the choice of
three tilings deportation to his motherland
a whitewashed cell in the penitencier na-
tionale or a firing squad on dessalines
field

  his keen eyes were on her as he delivered
this theatrical ultimatum suspect though
herr eckermann was there was far too
much lacking in the secret dossier of gaston
leroy to warrant any step that would
bring a german cruiser bristling into port-
au-prince harbor

  it was a chance shot delivered on the spur
of the moment but it went home he saw
it in the black eyes that went wide with
mingled terror at the threat and relief at
the belief that she held in her hand a weapon
that she might use if worse came to worst
meanwhile her hands were busily flitting to
her hair smoothing out her crumpled frock
then with a great sigh she said

  iwillremember iam ready now cherid

  on deck once more with the haunting
chorus of the music-hall ballad on his lips
clare dillon strode to the starboard gang-
way

  welcome on board herr eckermann i
am indeed honored

  to this insouciant greeting herr ecker-
mann had but a spluttered storm of teu-
tonic invective to offer as he clumsily
mounted the gangway

  you will suffer the loss of your flag for
this monsieur dillon he raged as he
reached the deck

  pardon me admiral dillon if you
please came the unruffled reply

  herr eckermann took a menacing step
forward his face was purple

  by what right dare you entertain my
wife overnight on this swine of a warship
he bellowed

  stop where you are or ill have one of
my blacks flog you off the ship you have
insulted my ship i will attend to that
later you may be sure the words came
cold and minatory but you nor any
other pig of a prussian or man of a decent
race may not insult a woman on a ship that
flics the flag of the haitian navy

  herr eckermanns mouth opened but
caution froze the words that his lips framed

  pierre sylvio

  two sailors stepped out of the knot of
curious onlookers their hands at salute

  escort this man back to his boat
shove it off and if he attempts to return
you will sink it vile

  herr eckermann now silent as the grave
moved chastened away between the two
blacks the native at the crazy oars of the
disreputable shore boat menaced by the
drawn cutlasses and the vivid creole pro-
fanity of pierre and sylvio shot away at
frantic speed five minutes later the im-
maculate gig of the flagship with admiral
dillon and madame eckermann seated be-
neath its awning of striped red and blue
passed it halfway to the shore

  of course the story spread like wildfire
through the cafes where all of port-au-
princes leading citizens gathered at noon
for their aperitifs from there it found its
way to the palm-shaded houses of the villa
district and in the palace the black despot
of haiti chuckled grimly at it the jour-
nalists of the capital always on the gut vive
for a piquant story found in it an inex-
haustible source of discreetly veiled humor

  the arrogant domineering herr ecker-
mann had never been popular in the capital
this sunny frenchman of irreproachable
manner and debonair carriage who had
worked his wizardry on the decaying hai-
tian navy had long ago captured its fancy
the social creed of the capital had ever been
an amazing contradiction of stiff conven-
tions and outrageously loose ones

  from the incident magnified with every


adventure

telling emerged three salient points herr
eckermann was the butt of an audacious
frenchman between the charming aus-
trian and him there existed an idyllic ro-
mance and no man could with impunity
insult even his own wife on the deck of a
haitian warship while admiral dillon was
in command

  the more significant fruits of madame
eckermanns unconventional visit to the
crele-a-pierrot followed while the affair was
still a nine-day sensation clare dillon
was entering the grilled gateway of gaston
leroys house at night when one of the
eckermann servants covertly handed him
an envelope that bore a faint distinctive
perfume he hardly needed to glance at
the slanted signature of the note to know
that it was a message from madame herself
a moment later he and leroy were bent
breathlessly over its startling news

  herr eckermann goaded to a violent out-
burst by the publicity of his discomfiture
had struck her twice and had threatened
her with further violence if she left the house
before his return from a trip to jamaica the
next day at noon

  humiliated beyond endurance and thirst-
ing for revenge the proud austrian dis-
closed the secret of the jamaican trip it
was the beginning so she warned of exten-
sive plans to run guns and ammunition
through the haitian ports to the forces
massing in the north under nord alexandre

          it was their first definite knowl-
          edge that eckermann was the

guiding genius behind the threat-
r enc revolution gaston leroy
struck his clenched fist against his knee
his black eyes were blazing but his words
came slow and measured

  without arms nord alexandre is help-
less for all his bombastic threats if we
can capture the ship with which eckermann
will try to run his guns through we will see
that revolution wither away like a palm
tree struck by lightning we will also make
it impossible for eckermann to place his
foot on haitian soil again except at the risk
of his life he is the brains of the revolu-
tionary faction and he is its money bags
if it is a german ship that he has char-
tered in jamaica and we seize her broke
in clare it will mean very uncomfortable
relations with germany will it not
germany answered leroy is even

now crowding us for a substantial payment
on the last extortionate loan she forced on
us i must persuade charlemagne to pledge
to her without delay enough of the coffee
revenues for the year to make that pay-
ment this is a bumper year and should
amount to not less than eighty thousand
pounds that would go far towards ap-
peasing her insatiable appetite

  yes of a certainty if eckermanns gun-
runner should be a german ship and we
confiscate her cargo it would precipitate a
delicate situation if we do not seize her
nord alexandre will be pounding at the
gates of the capital within a fortnight after
he has its arms and ammunition

  then we are fairly between the devil
and the deep blue sea  laughed clare

  you find it a delightful dilemma le-
roy observed dryly well the die is cast
tomorrow i send word by the jamaica boat
to larraque my agent there he will track
herr eckermann and give us timely warn-
ing of the gun-runner and its port i think
it will be gonaives for that is a railhead
and always an important link between the
revolutionary armies and the coast

  and i said clare dillon will have
steam ready at a minutes notice thank
heavens gaston the squadron is fit to
tackle any german ship from the kaisers
flagship down

  he broke into the rollicking chorus of a
parisian music-hall ballad and then filled
the glasses before them

  to the haitian navy and destruction to
any ship that flies the flag of our ancient
foe

  they drank the toast standing gaston
leroys eyes were dark and somber with
forbiddings and clares aglow with the bat-
tle-call of the irish wild geese fighting as
always under an alien flag

  charlemagne acquainted with the new
turn of affairs swung his whip under its
lash the haitian senate rushed through a
law that pledged forty per cent of the cof-
fee revenues to amortization of the german
loan that action he well knew would go
far towards softening any reprisals that
wilhelmstrasse might adopt should ad-
miral dillon take the unprecedented step of
seizing a german ship and confiscating its
contraband cargo

  meanwhile the efficient net of gaston
leroy made daily hauls day by day fa-
miliar faces were no longer seen on the
breed of the wild geese

hi

streets in the cafs and in the market-
places of port-au-prince the net was no
respecter of aristocrat or peasant the posi-
tive identification of herr eckermann as
the head of the revolutionary movement
and the thorough search of his papers had
provided the necessary clews out on the
drear sand-flats of dessalines field ragged
musketry volleys took toll of the leaders
the gates in the gray walls of the peniten-
cier nationale closed on others while a for-
tunate few were granted the privilege of
exile inexorably the brown and black
hands drew in the net

  out in the harbor clare dillons squadron
strained at their leash for word from lar-
raque in jamaica for a fortnight leroys
men worked day and night and then came
word from larraque

  the capital was still plunged in darkness
when the squadron steamed out for its
blockade stations to cape haitien and
porl-de-paix on the northern coast went the
dessalines and the hyppolile to mole st
nicolas went the christophe to gonaives
headed the cete-a-picrrot and at dawn the
four-starred flag of admiral dillon whipped
out from her mainmast head

three days later the ham-
burg-american liner marcoma-
nia stood boldly in at noon
into the mangrove-lined harbor
of gonaives the rumble of her anchor
chains and the cloud of red rust from the
hawse-pipe through which they ran had
barely died away when a boat shot out to
her from the crete-a-pierrot

  it needed only a cursory inspection of the
boarding officer carried out despite the
vehement protests of the burly captain to
bare the brazen masquerade of cases and
boxes that were packed to the brim with
arms and ammunition for nord alexan-
dres blacks back of that startling visit
and search were the cutlasses and pistols
of the boarding party and back of them the
potent threat of the crele-a-pierrots star-
board battery with its crews at the guns

  back to the capital went the contraband
of war by one audacious stroke admiral
clare dillon had armed the poorly equipped
troops of charlemagne and up in the hills
nord alexandre waited vainly for the rifles
without which he could not begin his cam-
paign

  then came a lull in the storm but to

clare dillon it meant that the kaiser in
far-off berlin was closing his mailed fist for
a dramatic gesture had the gun-runner
been a craft of insignificant tonnage the
seizure softened by charlemagnes pledge
of the coffee revenues would doubtless have
ended in haitis apology following the in-
terchange of diplomatic notes but the
mar comania was the queen of the great
fleet of german liners that plied the carib-
bean and a reserve auxiliary cruiser of the
high sea fleet

  except for short dashes out to sea for tar-
get practise the crele-a-pierrot lay at an-
chor off gonaives decks cleared for action
steam up waiting for the next move of the
kaiser the rainy season was on over
the low mangrove-lined shores heavy mists
hung at dawn and at sunset miasmatic
fever-breeding

  the sanitary condition of the town was
deplorable clare dillon exhausted by
strain and incessant labor was one of the
first victims of the scourge of malaria that
fastened upon gonaives daily rains that
drenched him pitiless suns that burned him
had finally exacted their toll

  gaston leroy found him a pitiful wreck
of his old self when he boarded the flagship
with despatches and the latest news from
the capital of the still abortive revolution

  an hour later he had clare ashore in the
home of the chief of the gonaives arrondis-
sement where the change from shipboard
life and efficient care would go far towards
his recuperation

  the change was already working for the
better when a sleek german cruiser stood
boldly in the harbor and came to anchor a
scant thousand yards from the crcte-a-
picrrot to clare dillon shaken with fever
and pale as a ghost came the stern ultima-
tum that the captain of the cruiser the
panther had delivered

  surrender within an hour or i will blow
you out of the water ran the challenge

  it transformed clare dillon from a fever-
shaken convalescent into a dynamic sailor-
man deaf to the protests of gaston le-
roy and the scandalized nurse and to the
accompaniment of blithe badinage he
forced them both to help him into the full
uniform of his rank at breakneck speed
they drove to the landing place where the
crete-a-pierrols gig was still in waiting as
he stepped into the stern sheets and took the
tilier-ropes clare dillon shouted gaily


adventure

  at the gonaives club at eight tonight
gaston we will celebrate you and i and
all gonaives with us

  on board the flagship he found the crew
on the verge of panic swiftly he wrought
order out of chaos with orders that came
fast and clean-cut as machine-gun fire
they were far the reverse however of the
decisions he had long dreamed of his
witless engineer had allowed the fires to die
out without steam with which to maneu-
ver it was stark suicide to fight the panther
with its superior gunfire and armor at close
range

  severe as the blow was he accepted it
with characteristic nonchalance and the
black officers and crew worked like mad-
men under the spur of his incisive or-
ders and the blue magic of his smiling
eyes

  there remained but ten minutes of the
ultimatum and clare dillon had all but
completed his audacious plans from stem
to stern from maintruck to keelson the
crele-a-pierrot had flowered out in the col-
orful bunting reserved for gala occasions
her decks were wet and odorous with kero-
sene the covers had been whipped away
from the powder magazines at the foot of
the mainmast lay the red and blue battle
flag made fast to signal halliards

dusk was coming to the harbor
on swift wings when f the flag-
ships bugler sounded the shrill
clear notes of abandon ship
off to starboard the menacing black muz-
zles of the german cruiser were trained on
the gailydressed haitian gunboat on her
decks the german boarding party was fall-
ing into ranks

  with the last thin note of the bugle the
crew of the crete-a-pierrot moved in perfect
discipline over the sides into the boats
waiting at the gangways and beneath the
outswung boatbooms on the quarterdeck
admiral clare dillon lifted his cocked hat
in siler t farewell to the men whom he had
molded from a mob into a smart man-o-
wars crew

  as the boats shoved clear and made for
the beach that was lined with all of gona-
ives he walked briskly forward at the
foot of the mainmast he halted to the
short steady strokes of his arms the battle
flag moved up to the peak of its hoist a
bundle of red and blue one sharp tug it

broke clear and whipped out to the sea
breeze in defiance to the enemy

  and now with steps that were unsteady
and slow clare dillon posted himself over
the opened hatches of the main battery
magazine forward in one hand he held his
watch in the other the muzzle of a loaded
revolver swung in uncertain circles it was
only by a supreme effort that he could keep
his feet

  as the minute hand ticked to the hour
mark the revolver flashed like an over-
ripe melon the crele-a-pierrot opened up to
the terrific explosion the crashing salvo
of six-inch guns from the panther whipped
up futile geysers of green water where only
the mastheads of the crete-a-pierrol and a
welter of wreckage marked her anchorage
at the main the red-and-blue battle flag still
waved in defiance

  true to his appointed rendezvous gaston
leroy was at the table he had reserved
for dinner at eight at the gonaives club
there were two covers on the table and two
champagne glasses beside them to the
friends who trooped in serious of face and
yet thrilled with pride over the glorious end
of the crete-a-pierrot gaston leroy could
offer no more than a silent nod when the
sun had set in a riot of color over the grave
of the crete-a-pierrot it had been to him
as though all the color of his life had died
with it

  the heavy stamp of feet on the stairs be-
low and a chorus of raucous laughter woke
him from his sad reveries into the quiet
club-rooms trooped the captain and staff
of the panther in white uniforms and pith
helmets swords clanking at their heels
behind them came herr eckermann with
his cold gray eyes flushed with elation

  it was halfway through his cheerless din-
ner that gaston leroys brooding eyes saw
herr eckermann rise unsteadily to propose
a toast the big hand of the german cap-
tain caught him by the arm and the banker
collapsed drunkenly in his seat then with
uplifted glass brimming with champagne
the panthers captain boomed out in his na-
tive tongue

  gentlemen the kaiser hochi

  of all the haitians in the room gaston
leroy alone was on his feet he had
caught a quick familiar tread mounting
the stairs on his face was the imprint of a
bewildered incredulous joy

  into the room gone silent again under
breed of the wild geese



the german insult strode admiral clare
dillon his full-dress uniform was wet and
bedraggled his right arm was in a sling of
dirty muslin his eyes glowed like burning
embers out of a face that was ashy pale
with the proud heads-up tread of an ad-
miral of the fleet and with superb insolence
in his level gaze he passed the stupefied
germans and joined gaston leroy short
gasps of amazed disbelief broke the silence
and more than one superstitious haitian
swif tly crossed himself with trembling fingers

  gaston his voice came in a whisper
a glass of wine and be quick my dear
friend how i made my way ashore from
a bit of wreckage to which i had clung is a
nightmare i only know that a peasant
woman found me on the beach helped me
to her hut and between the two of us we
managed to bandage my arm and side
you must pardon this deplorable toilet

  the whisper tailed off into thin air as he
gulped down the glassful and speedily re-
filled with the litheness of a schoolboy he
leaped from his chair to the table his free
arm ripped away the bandaged loop from his
right arm with the glass held high above
his head he cried-

  vive haiti death to all prussian swine

  his voice rang dear as a bell over the
awakened tumult of haitian cheers to that
intrepid toast the old insouciant smile
was back on his face and his eyes were
dancing it was only for a brief flashing
moment he held that pose but it was to live
long in the crowded memories of gaston
leroy a sudden pain twisted the smiling
face the glass fell from relaxed fingers and
shattered in a crumpled heap he crashed
to the floor

  with trembling fingers gaston leroy
tore open the collar of the blue tunic they
came out wet with the blood that gushed
out from beneath the bandage that had
slipped from over a gaping wound

  splinter of boat that went in there
clare dillon whispered faintly

  for a moment his sea-blue eyes rested
fondly on gaston leroy one convulsive
shudder and the soul of one more audacious
lovable irish wild goose had gone on its
last light gaston leroy kissed the damp
brow reverently and straightened up with
a dozen swift strides he was squarely before
the captain of the panther his arm shot
out to full jength like a rapiers thrust

  go his voice rose in shrill rage go
or by all that i hold holy the men of gona-
ives will tear you limb from limb and toss
you to the sharks in the harbor that you
have defiled

  there was a sinister menace in that
pointed arm a deadly challenge in the ring
of black men and brown that had formed in
triple ranks about the germans there was
cold truth in that threat and the germans
rose their swords clanked at their heels
as they turned and left but not a hand was
on its sword hilt

  once more gaston leroys arm shot out
like a rapier his fingers fastened like hooks
of steel on herr eckermanns throat the
fear of death was in the cold gray eyes of
herr eckermann but the german officers
stalked stolidly on

  you ilerr eckermann will not go with
your friends said gaston leroy in a voice
that had suddenly gone cold i have kept
a rendezvous tonight with a gallant soul
that fought its way through hell to keep it
with me you will keep a rendezvous to-
night

  it will be with a keen blade or with the
muzzles of a firing squad or for i am in a
generous mood you may drink one glass be-
fore we start for that rendezvous there is
a drink that we brew in the hills you
should know it well for nord alexandre is
an expert in its use it is pure white which
you are not it is without odor which you
are not herr eckermann i think you will
choose it for it kills even more quickly than
a knife or a bullet come for i have other
work to do your choice

the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

tt was in june  that we routed the french

  at dcttingen in bavaria we had been without
food or fodder for many a day and as soon as the
french broke leaving open the road to hanau the
army forgot the enemy in its eagerness to reach its
base of supplies

  my nag was in such a plight that i was left be-
hind and in the night came upon a french officer
and killed him after a long-drawn fight i relieved
him of a fine sword rings gold buttons and other
booty then australian marauders our allies set
upon me badly wounded i lay out in the marshes
until a party of our own men found me and carted
me to hanau

  a physician named gulf took me into his house
and cared for me in exchange for one of the rings i
had taken from the frenchman when the army
marched out of hanau i was left lichind for i was
still very weak some days later i was discharged
although i was in no state to travel and the doctor
would have robbed me of my last gold button had i
given him the chance

  at a near-by tavern i met a youth viscount bar-
net who had deserted his post because he wished to
reach england in a great hurry an estate awaited
him there but he was without funds and in debt
he suggested that i let him exchange my booty for
money lend half the sum to him and that we travel
together to the coast this i agreed to do although
gulf cursed me for a fool and went so far as to oiler
me a commission in the army of the pretender
charles stuart but i cursed him back and left his
house

  we started the viscount and i in the frankfort
diligence but were held up by a scouting party
which tried to slaughter us for the officer knew tliat
barnet was a deserter we were almost beaten
when a party of horsemen that i had seen at gulfs
house came to our rescue they cut down the
scouting party and rode away no sign could i find

  the bold dragoon copyright iqs by leonard b

nason

of barnet until i reentered the diligence and found
him hiding beneath a bale of goods

  do you owe those men money i asked

  well not money but something of the sort
said he and then would speak no more but held his
peace chewing upon his fingers

hen we reached frankfort we hired horses to
continue our journey a fortnight later we
put up at an inn near brussels where there were
many english officers one of them picked a quar-
rel with us and the viscount killed him he es-
caped leaving me to defend myself as best i might
until knocked down and sorely beaten

   awoke in a stable midden the viscount was
there and helped me mount my horse and away
but i was so weak and bruised that i could not sit
my horse and fell off very soon barnet left me for
he was in grave danger agreeing to meet me at the
sign of the gaper in the town of williamstadt

  next day i found that the viscount had taken my
last penny and i had to beg my way afoot to the
seaport there i found an english boat whose
skipper first took me later to the sign of the gaper
where i was told the viscount had sailed the week
week before for england and then aboard his vessel

   i slept so soundly that  awoke only when we were
well out to sea on board were the six travelers
who had saved us from the scouting party they
disclosed themselves as agents of the pretender and
their leader asked me to serve with them when i
stoutly refused i was given until we reached the
coast to agree to his proposal or die

  when we hove to however we were set upon by
gagers and soldiery and i escaped in the dark the
near-by villagers were in arms because a local tavern
keeper had been taken by the press gang and forced
to enlist after being embroiled with them for half
a night i broke away and made my way across the
moor until a coach overtook me and i climbed into
the rumble-tumble i slept soundly until the
coach was halted by a highwayman i hid by the

ii
the bold

roadside my sword still lying in the rumble-tumble
until the coach drove off then i leaped out of hiding
and took possession of the highwaymans loot one
man who had tried to resist sprawled unconscious
and unnoticed in the middle of the path

   having relieved the highwayman of his ill-gotten
gains i helped him to mount with the toe of my boot
and sent him on his way

t set about reviving the man who lay in the road-
way and found him to be none other than my
viscount his excuses for having played me so
many scurvy tricks were so convincing that i be-
lieved him we went to an inn where we found the
passengers of the coach bewailing their losses at
once the viscount denounced me saying that i was
a confederate of the highwayman and had upon me
all the booty when this was found to be true i
was assailed and thrown into a dark stable and
locked in but the landlord who had found my
sword in the rumble thought me to be an agent of
the pretender he set me free and i quickly took
the road to london

   there one night i fell in with a party of young
bloods and set them to flight after killing one of

- -it was of two minds whether to
        cram my sword down his throat
        or to go at once to mrs brockhurst

- and acquaint her with the whole

story finally i decided to hold my peace
perhaps we would all perish on these dreary
waters and the estate revert to the crown
for lack of heirs

  indeed such a solution of the thing seemed
very probable the gale continued to in-
crease the ship rolled fearfully and stood
first upon her bow and then upon her stern
so that a man could not keep upright

  the water no longer whispered and chat-
tered along the sides but hammered and
beat and hammered like a kingsmessenger
with his sword hilt the water came down
into the berth in great quantities so that
very soon it was almost mid-leg deep on the
floor

  once i struggled out on to the deck but
it was perishing cold sleet and snow drove
across the ship like myriad javelins and the
sailormen hurried by with anxious faces
the sea was a moor no longer but range
after range of mountain peaks their tops
white and foaming like the pyrenees capped
with snow i have faced death many times
perhaps as much or more than most men of
my age but never did it seem so distasteful
as on that winter sea where all was cold
and gray and horrible

  there came a day when the wind went
down somewhat but the sea was still very
high i left the viscount rolled in his bed
covering snoring heavily and went on deck

dragoon	

them with my sword a friend of the dead man
stood his ground and having disarmed him i found
that once again i had viscount barnet at my mercy
he made haste to tell me that the man i had killed
the honorable george brockhurst was heir to a
rich estate in the americas to make amend for
all his ill services he suggested that i cross the at-
lantic with him he would impersonate the hon-
orable george and claim the estate which we would
then share equally to this i agreed for nothing
seemed to await me in england save starvation

  passages having already been secured on board
the gull we lay safe below and avoided the officers
who were seeking us the first day at sea we found
two women passengers aboard the widow of the
honorable george and an attendant she too was
going to america to claim her late husbands estate

  she was young and pretty and i spent much time
with her which sorely vexed my viscount for he was
afraid she might cheat him out of the estate i told
him that it was hers by right and that for all of me
she might have it

  his eyes glittered as he retorted-

  one death got me this estate-another may keep
it for me

i had not been there very long before i
espied the cabin door open and mrs
brockhurst came forth and-joy unspeak-
able-alone at once i was at her side and
she turned with a glad cry

  oh i have been so frightened the last
few days that terrible storm and it
was so dark in there

  she came quite close to me and perforce
must take hold of my arm to steady herself
against the motion of the ship we went to
the rail and i held her very tightly so that
she should not fall over and we stood thus
a long time watching the leaping of the
waves once or twice she sighed gently and
looked up at me

  now we of the mounted forces are ever
told that ours is an arm of opportunity
that cavalry that sees its moment of ad-
vantage and hurls at that instant the full
shock of its attack upon the enemy horses
thundering swords waving and men shout-
ing must be irresistible so then seeing
my moment of advantage i held the fair
lady a bit closer and proceeded to implant
a chaste kiss upon her cheek at that she
struggled a bit but not too hard then cast
down her eyes looked at me again and
having no use for the kiss that i had given
her returned it to me again

  ho there bellowed a vulgar voice from
over our heads below there i say

  i looked up startled and very confusedly
stepped away from the lady the master
of the ship stood at the head of the ladder
that went to the helmsmans place and
ii

adventure

peered down at me when he saw that i
perceived him he beckoned me

  could you step up here a moment sir
he called and with a great deal of wonder-
ment i went after seeing maud-i could call
her that now-into the cabin and having
kissed her hand at parting

  i had never been in this part of the ship
before the platform or poop deck i be-
lieve they called it was over the cabin roof
and was very lofty forward i could see
the whole stretch of the deck and beyond
the ropes and the masts the mountainous
waters into which our ship crashed and
threw up fountains of white water two
men stood straining at the helm and one
peered over the stern at something with a
perspective glass

  here said the master taking the glass
from the other man and holding it out to
me have a look

  i adjusted the glass and peered through
it but could see nothing but waves

what is there to be seen i asked
here said the other man whom i re-
membered was the man we had first seen
on the vessel and who was one of the
officers

  here and he pointed the glass for me
sure enough there was something there
i thought at first it was a stick floating
but after a time when i had steadied the
glass and looked more carefully i perceived
what it was

  why tis a ship i exclaimed

  a french ship added the master look-
ing at me very hard

  well what then i cried for there was
a feeling in the air that boded me no
good what is the idea of showing me
this ship

  why this answered the master she
is a french ship and we have had her in
sight since daybreak she was visible from
the masthead black against the rising sun
and now as you see she can be seen from
here when we alter our course a point or
two she does likewise

  how does this concern me

  if she comes up on us which she will do
i shall expect you to speak to her master or
whoever is in command and see that he
hinders neither my voyage nor harms my
ship nor my goods

  are you crazy man i asked him in
astonishment you rave what weight
can i have with a french captain

  are you not a french officer asked the
master meaningly

  the man was drunk or else i was crazy
my head reeled and i staggered and took
hold of a rope to steady myself the
swaying and tossing of the accursed vessel
was more pronounced on this part of her
and was increased by the height of the poop
above the deck

  so what with the effect of my long stay
in that pesthole below decks and the blow
of the masters question and the heave of
the deck i was taken ill and must perforce
seek the rail when i had somewhat re-
covered myself i turned to the master
and asked him weakly enough what he
meant

  did you not come aboard said he

bearing a french sword i have seen
enough of them before for i carried many
a soldier back and forth from france to
scotland during the fifteen i was but a
lad then but i remember and i have
seen them since many of them when
i have been in brest and not only
that but the next day after you were
come aboard who should come out but
a boatload of soldiers looking for a french
officer

  i groaned so the picinino had gotten
me into more trouble

  i am an englishman i said a dra-
goon of ligoniers i got that sword at
dettingen do i look like a frenchman
is there anything about me that suggests

a- dirty shoulder-shrugging eyebrow-

lifting hand-waving monseer is there
is not my speech as good english as your
own

  if yonder ship comes up on you i
cried i will do what i can to keep them
off your decks if i am able to stand but it
will be with my sword and not with my
voice any command of mine would have
as much weight with a frenchman as yours
with these waves moreover we are not
at war with france

  that will not stop him from plundering
my ship any more than it stopped the
french and english killing each other at
your battle of dettingen well there will
lie nothing to do but try our heels and if
that fails then we must have a brush with
him

  then he turned to the other man and
gave some order touching on the manage-
ment of the ship
the bold dragoon



i went directly down into the
berth and took the picinino
down from its peg

  sword said i i think there
is a curse upon you you have brought
me nothing but bad luck since the day i
found you and i have a good mind to be rid
of you

  but when i drew the blade from the scab-
bard and felt the balance of it and noted
what excellent springy steel it was and how
well it fitted my hand and what good pro-
tection the heavy basket hilt gave to the
wrist i quite forgave it

  if this frenchman lays us aboard i
said i will have need of a good friend like
you

  what are you muttering about de-
manded the viscount rolling his head at me
sleepily

  did you know that we were at war with
france i asked

  i heard no talk of it before we left
london why

  theres a french ship in pursuit of us

  be-to it said he i hope they

kill us all go away and let me sleep and
he turned his face to the wall

  i got a leather bucket and some rags and
made shift to dry out the berth for the
water slopped about very much and was
quite deep it took me the better part of
the morning but it was better than lying
groaning in my bed after i had eaten i
felt better and the master of the ship came
down and asked us if we had pistols

  upon my saying we had none he went
away and came back with two for me
and a heavy cutlas for the viscount who
had no sword the sea is going down
fast said the master and we may yet
show this man a clean pair of heels but
still we may not so look to your weapons

  that night the lady appeared and doris
being yet indisposed we had a long visit
the frenchman was still in our wake and
by now the entire ships company knew of
him if he came up with us on the morrow
then surely we must have a fight and i
thought it best to go into it with a clear
conscience

  so then sitting close beside the lady and
holding her hand she calling me hugh and
i calling her maud i told her the entire
account of our purpose in going to the col-
onies and a full history of all my dealing
with the viscount save only that i did not

tell her it was i who had killed her husband

  to my surprize she did not weep or cry
or do any of the things that a woman might
do in such a time but sat silently for a
little while

  i had thought of something like this
she said at last i was not aboard here
a great while before i found out that the
viscount was traveling as the honorable
george brockhurst you know that our
marriage was a secret one and i have been
using my own name so that the people of
the ship did not know that my name was
brockhurst too

  i have known him all these years you
see for a liar and the son of a lying house so
that i thought at once of villany as for the
estate i knew nothing of it i but thought
we were going to america perhaps george
was to surprize me with the news of it later
and i will tell you more it was geordies
intention to give this viscount the slip and
to that end he had not told him the proper
date of the sailing but has secured passage
for us both and said nothing

  ah i cried i see now why the vis-
count was so surprized to find that the hon-
orable george was to sail so soon and had
not told him so but why did he write to
flanders for the viscount if he did not
wish to take him with him

  he never wrote the viscount found it
out and posted with hot haste to lay hold of
geordie and say that he must take him to
america with him or he would lay him
in jail for the debt my husband owed him
but what shall i do now have you any
thought how i shall proceed

  that said i we shall see when we
have come to land meanwhile be of good
heart for i will think of some devise yet
then i besought her to be very careful for
the viscount was a desperate man and would
murder her if he got the chance but i
assured her i will keep my eye upon
him

  and if there is a fight you will be care-
ful wont you for my sake hugh

  that i will i said and with that i left
her

  yet another day we held upon our course
while the sea became calmer but the
frenchman stayed with us and gained so
that now he could be made out without a
glass the gull had four small cannon
two of a side and two wall pieces on the
forecastle and likewise on the platform


adventure

before the great cabin these were cast loose
and the cordage cleared from about them

  the pikes lhat stood about the masts
were taken down and laid handily about the
decks powder was brought up and every
preparation made for a desperate struggle
a huge copper was filled with water and
heated to be poured upon any one at-
tempting to scale our decks for my part
i had up the picinino and ground its edge
and overhauled the pistols the captain had
given me the viscount came out of his
sullenness enough to come up on deck and
assist with the preparations and indeed
seemed to be quite cheered at the prospect
of action

  at sunset i was upon the after deck with
the master of the ship looking toward where
the darkness was already hiding the french
vessel who hath not seen at the far edge
of a wide heath a door suddenly open
letting out a flash of light from the fire
within and then shut again such a flash
of light came to us across the darkening sea
and then after some little time the dull
crash of a gun

  we looked over the side but could not
see where the shot went for it was too dark
i scarcely think it came as far as our ship
for we were quite distant from die french-
man

  if it comes on to be dark said the mas-
ter and the clouds will cover that -

moon we may yet show monseer a trick

  the night indeed was dark and the cold
of a sudden became frightful the sailors
cried to each other that there was ice
about and with this new terror i was like
to give up the ghost great mountains
they told me of ice came floating down
from the north floating and floating and
peopled with strange and horrible beasts
bears and tigers and wolves and whatnot
and if a ship ran upon one of them it was
her death

some time in the night there
was a great creaking of yards and
groaning of cordage and the ship
heeled over tremendously upon
my going up i found all calm and the sailors
coiling down the ropes again they said
they had gone about and were now on an-
other course intending to throw the french-
man off the track a trick they could not do
before because of the bright moon of the
preceding nights

  the next morning i leaped eagerly on
deck to see if we had indeed shaken off the
frenchman but alas there was a great fog
upon the water so that from the door that
went into our berth i could not see the
mast in the middle of the ship

  all day we lay in this fog the sails
flapping and the yards creaking dolefully
while the master and the crew hung over
the side listening and listening

  what do you expect to hear i asked
them

  the sea breaking on the ice we would
fire guns and tell by the sound if there was
ice about but it might bring the french-
man down upon us

  it was bitter cold so that i took no
pleasure in being on deck nor any in the
viscounts company who was leaning over
the bulwarks with the rest i had hoped
that maud might come out but there was
no sign of her nor had i seen her since
i had first told her of the frenchman i
went therefore into the berth and lay
down and so spent the day and after sup-
per went to sleep uncomfortably enough in
that stinking hole under my wet coverings

  i awakened suddenly flat on my back on
the floor of the berth there was something
soft under me that squirmed mightily and
then i knew that i had been cast from my
shelf and had fallen upon the viscount
there was a tremendous crashing and
thumping against the side and a wild shout-
ing on the deck

  off my head said the viscount in a
smothered voice it is the ice by the
feet of paul

  at that we both struggled on deck for we
slept fully dressed because of the cold
here all was dark and wet the dripping
sails hanging to the yard and a dank cold
about the men were shouting terribly
and there was an echo from the mist that
came back at us a hundred fold

  an echo indeed it was the ice there
was a black something against our side
grinding and rubbing and long fingers
searched above us in the rigging so that
ropes and blocks and spars kept tumbling
upon the decks all was the wildest con-
fusion and the fearful clamor would strike
terror to any man i care not who he might
be

  my first thought was for maud and i
leaped up the steps to beat upon the cabin
doors and acquaint her with her danger
the bold dragoon



but as i stood upon the last step i heard
a shout from the black wall against our
side the words were french that i knew
although i did not know their meaning
i stood transfixed a block tumbled from
aloft and nearly brained me but a great
yellow eye rolled up at me and then rolled
back it was the cabin window of another
ship

  to arms i roared to arms the
french are upon us tis a french ship

  i called at my loudest and leaped down
into the waist but none paid me any heed
i ran from one to the other but they were
all so mad with terror of the supposed ice
and the black night that i might as well
have sung them a catch for all the heed they
paid me

   stopped then and thought what to do
that was no echo that shouting from the
blackness the tones of it were different
it was louder than the clamor on our ship

and i thought that there must be silence
after a time for the men would lack breath
to howl

  here i stumbled upon the viscount trying
to light a lanthorn with a portfire at once
i seized the portfire from him and dashing

to one of the guns that had been ready
loaded since the day before i applied it to
the vent flame leaped from the muzzle
in a wide sheet lighting up the high bul-
warks of the frenchman her masts and
spars all tangled in our own the wreck of
torn sails and the seamen standing with
open mouths looking down at us

  to arms i bellowed in the silence
after the explosion to arms god save
the kingl

if there had been a clamor be-
fore a tumult ensued that would
have outshouted all the lunatics
in bedlam all was a deep
blackness so that no man could see beyond
the length of his arm and men ran about
crashing into the masts and falling down
the ladders some tried to fire the guns
others ran to the racks about the masts or
fumbled on the decks for pikes

  a man with a deep voice bayed for some
one to kindle lanthoras while for every
word that was shouted on our deck those
on the deck of the french ship shouted two
the french being given to a great deal of
noise when any emergency arises the
masters of both ships would have cast off

and gotten away into the inky fog but the
yards of the two were so locked and tangled
that there was no separating the ships

  i rememlered that there was a wall piece
or falconet on the forecastle of our ship
and i ran thither and trained it down into
where i supposed the frenchmans deck to
be and fired it the llame showed me little
beyond ropes and masts and a few men
running with great speed but there were
shrieks so i suppose  had caused some
damage

  i also saw that the frenchmans bul-
warks were much higher than ours but that
from where i stood a crossing might be
made into the other ship where any fight
that we were to make must be made since
he could fire down into us and butcher us at
will

  as i turned to descend the ladder there
was the most terrible explosion that i have
ever heard the entire side of the enemy
ship was one vast sheet of flame he had
fired his broadside into us happily the
frenchman had not depressed his guns or
else he could not lower their muzzles
sufficiently to sweep our decks for most of
his shot flew straight across our ship and so
into the sea one of them found a mark in
the mast where we found it the next day
and another wounded two men who both
cried out lustily that they were dead and
there was a great rending of wood but not
much harm

  i went down into the waist and at that
moment some one on the frenchman lighted
a great fire of some sort or other so that
they could see what they were about this
also gave us some light by its reflection from
the sails and i contrived to find the viscount
and the master of the ship whom i told to
gather his men and we would launch an
attack on them from the forecastle for
this i was heartily cursed and told to mind
my own business

  the viscount however seized my arm

  lead on he said i care even less for
fighting than i do for sailoring but where
you go i will follow and by reason of this
speech i forgave him many things

  we mounted the ladder to the forecastle
again whence we could see down into the
frenchmans decks they had a fire blaz-
ing in an iron basket in the mid part of the
ship and by its light we could see them
massing with all manner of pikes and wea-
pons and before we could cry a warning


adventure

they had tumbled over their bulwarks and
were down upon our deck like so many
bugs our people had meanwhile fled aft
and taken position on the after deck before
the great cabin so that the french must
climb the stairs to come to them

  let us load this barker i shouted
to the viscount and we will stir them
up a bit

  there was a keg of old iron and nails and
broken stuff ready to hand and another
of powder under a cloth we had these
out and loaded the wall piece and then
turned it inboard on its swivel

  have a care i said lest we let some of
this iron into our own party

  be-to them said the viscount and

fired the piece

  then while he reloaded it i skipped across
the forecastle to the one that stood on the
other side and warmly received with it a
number of the enemy who came charging
forward to see who was firing into their
rear a deal of howling from the after
part of the ship told me that our iron-
mongery had not gone amiss

  it began to look as if we would shortly
have the decks cleared of the french they
being taken in both front and rear and un-
able to get on to the after part of the ship
where our company were the fire basket
on the other ship blazed high and lighted
the desperate conflict where the french
were trying to gain the poop

  we could see a blade flashing and the
men on the upper deck plying their pikes
like watermen poling a flatboat the mas-
ter of the vessel cried on his men and now
and again discharged a blunderbuss or some
piece of ordnance equally as heavy into
the mob in the waist these on their part
thrust upward with their pikes and howled
like a pack of wolves and hacked with their
swords but it was of no avail they could
not make their way up the ladders

  now having loaded the pieces on the
forecastle again a lengthy job because of the
darkness we fired them once more into the
frenchmans backs after this they began
to lose heart and some few fell back and
essayed to climb into their own vessel
which they finally did and we saw them no
more

  suddenly the fire on the french ship
went out leaving us all in panting darkness
the tumult of the battle aft died out first
into confused cries and a hurly-burly of

shouts which i suppose were cries for lights
and then at last into complete silence

  now the viscount was upon one side of
the deck and i the other and i heard him
call out suddenly

  bancroft they mount the ladder ha
then scratching sounds and grunting so
that i knew he had closed with some one
now i had come out of the berth without
any weapon thinking we had fallen upon
the ice and i knew that the viscount had
none either

  i remembered to have seen a short bar of
iron that was some part of the ships fur-
nishing close at hand and after fumbling
i found it and then listened for the sound of
some antagonist

  the darkness was as impenetrable as a
wall of stone i could hear grunts and
straining and the scuffling of feet across the
deck and i knew the viscount must be
holding his own so i moved toward the
ladder that came up on my side of the
deck

  as i did i thought i heard another sound
very soft and stealthy there must be an-
other man there that moved when i did
and sought to pry a knife into my ribs

  then as i thought what to do i smelled
a familiar smell one that brought back to
me a thought of flanders and of encounters
there in the darkness on wet nights such as
this i smelled a smell of wine and onions
and of a skin long unknown to water and
holding my breath and hearkening in a
moment i heard a whistle of breath very
carefully let out thereupon i raised up
my arm and hewed down with the bar with
all my strength he squeaked whereat i
struck again and after that there was no
further sound

  at the same moment almost came a
most horrid scream from the viscounts side
of the deck so that i knew one of them was
down but which it was i could not tell

  i have thrust the portfire into his eye
said the viscount and pistoled him with
his own weapon have any come up your
side

  one i replied that will shortly go
down again head first

  listen said the viscount we could
hear a soft creaking and slight sounds from
the ladder but when we moved quickly in
that direction the sounds retreated and we
could hear them scurrying aft like so many
rats
the bold dragoon



all was quiet for a little space
and we imagined both sides to be
catching their breath then of a
sudden there was a faint pistol
shot that seemed to come from the farther-
most part of out ship but low down near
the water

all this time i had been frantic with anxiety
concerning maud and where she had been
taken and if it was to a safe place and the
thought was in my mind that she might
have fired that pistol from a cabin window
but at the sound of the report there was a
tremendous howl from the after deck and a
great splintering of wood then cries of con-
sternation

  they have boarded us from the stem
by the bones of god cried the viscount
and at that we both rushed down the ladder
and sped aft

  in the darkness i ran full tilt into a gun
and sprawled across it to the deck where i
lay for some time wondering if i had broken
my leg or not at last i made out to rise
and putting out my hand to assist me i
felt a half-pike which i seized and by its
help stood upright

  there was a great deal of pistol firing
going on and exulting yells that never came
from english throats so i feared that the
battle went but ill the fighting had come
down from the after part into the waist and
steel clashed and feet stamped all about me
it was so black and the thought that the
fight was going against us so horrible that i
became quite sick at heart while i was at
my wits ends what to do the fight was
suddenly over i heard a few cries for
quarter the scamper of running feet and
then silence

  a voice cricd in french and some one
came over the side after that bearing lan-
thorns and began to go about the decks like
so many glow-worms i did then a very
foolish thing for i set myself in the shadow
of the mainmast and when any one went by
me i let him have some of my pike about a
foot or so of it there would be from time
to time a sudden wild clashing of swords and
some yelling but even this died down at last
and meanwhile i had disposed of some few

  had i stayed there i might have killed
them all off one by one or been discovered
and pistoled but i was consumed with a
fever of curiosity regarding maud and i set
forth very cautiously to work my way aft
to go up into the great cabin and see how

she had fared and protect her if possible
from the french

  i had gained the foot of the ladder in
safety and was wondering how high the pile
of corpses was that i could feel blocking it
when up from the door that went into our
berth came a number of men with a lant-
horn

  we stopped and looked at each other
while a mans heart might beat twice
then one snapped his pistol at me with a
loud cry and i thrust down into them with
my pike another hacked at me with a
sword and at the same instant i think three
or four must have leaped upon my back
for i fell head first into the clump of men
below me and what with them all beating
me about the head i had not any sense of
what took place thereafter

chapter vni

of our captivity

 thought at first that it was raining
but struggling upward through the
depths of pain that weighed upon me i
found that some one was trickling water on
my face i rested on this discovery for a
while and then essayed further enlighten-
ment and after a good deal of effort i dis-
covered two things that it was the vis-
count that poured water upon me from a
sponge and that i had but one eye that
would open and it but a little

  my head was just upon the point of
bursting and every bone in me burned as if
it were red hot so i lay as quietly as i could
and wondered whether to be glad that i was
alive or sorry that i was not dead a
little later i tried to speak and found there
was some things over my mouth that inter-
fered with speech which upon my reaching
out my hand to remove i found were my
lips prodigiously swollen

  lie down said the viscount in my ear
and let your mind be at peace we have
been taken by the french and you have
been beaten like an old sack but a piece of
good fortune has befallen us that bids fair
to make up for all our bad luck

  maud i asked after a great deal of
effort

  maud repeated the viscount maud
maud is safe enough i promise you

  thereupon i slept or fainted or some-
thing of the kind i never knew which


adventure

  i came to myself again later in the day
my head still aching tremendously but much
improved and my mind a good deal clearer
i opened my one eye and could see that it
was late in the day and that there were a
great number of men in the upper parts of
the masts repairing the damage of the col-
lision

  there was a great deal of new rope and
new timber where the yards had been
strengthened so that i guessed the work
was nearly complete i staggered to my
feet and crept onto the breech of one of
the guns which gave me opportunity of
looking about

  the after ladders that went up to the
great cabin were all hacked and cut and the
doors of the great cabin sagged outward on
their hinges their panels all splintered
across the deck from me some french sea-
men were rubbing brooms about and an-
other one was going about picking up half
pikes and pistols from where they were
scattered high and low

  there was no sail set upon the vessel and
she had rolled into the hollow of the waves
and was wallowing there like a sow across
from us at some little distance lay the
french ship a much larger one than ours
having six guns to the side and a figurehead
of samson rending the lion she had sail
upon her but those on the mainmast were
set against the others in such a way as to
hold the vessel stationary

  she had gone around to the other side of
us from where she had been during the fight
to prevent i suppose our drifting down up-
on her there were a number of french-
men about our decks their noses red and
tiieir faces all pinched and blue with the
cold but i saw no englishmen i began to
fear that they had all been butchered the
french paid me no heed save to scowl evilly
at me now and then but indeed i suppose
i was more an object of pity than of anger

  by this time i was near perished with
cold and i was intending to go down for my
great coat when i perceived it lying on the
deck where the viscount had cast it over me
while i was struggling into it the viscount
himself appeared and beckoned me to go
forward with him

  we went down into the crews quarters
and here i found seven other men that i re-
membered had been of our company and
seven or eight french seated about a bra-
zier or fire basket over which one of the

number was cooking the french stood
about in a half circle all armed to the eyes
and scowled at us

  now then said the viscount the
french captain who is not really a captain
but a lieutenant has said that we should
have something to eat and after that we are
to be taken to our berths and that so long
as we behave ourselves we will have two
meals and plenty of water each day and be
allowed an hour for excercise but that at the
first sign of disorder he would clap us all in-
to irons

  the englishmen all of whom bore hurts
upon them made no answer but huddled
closer about the brazier the viscount sat
down beside me

  how is the bold dragoon now he asked
merrily

  well i am better but that is not very
well after all how does it happen that you
are spokesman for the french

  aha laughed the viscount that
was a master stroke now listen and all
that has taken place will be made clear
firstly i have a goodly knowledge of
french having lived on the continent
several years and having moreover known
a number of french gentlemen in england
so then the battle having gone against us
i tripped very nimbly to where the captain
of the enemy a very bearded man was giv-
ing orders in a great voice and surrendered
myself into his hands

  then i informed him for the purpose of
their better protection that there were la-
dies aboard and suggested that he put a
guard at their door having very graci-
ously received my surrender he went so far
as to not only bestir himself for the safety of
the widow brockhurst but to see that there
was not a general massacre of all the pris-
oners indeed he is a very good sort that
frog eater

  we put up a-fight on the poop deck

a very confounded fight and would have
made a successful stand if they had not out-
numbered us i have heard went on the
viscount that the other ship is the arche-
vcque de rennes a privately owned ship with
a license to prey upon enemy commerce
and much stronger than we

  the french captain thought they had
collided with the ice as we did but finding
that we were english they had leaped
aboard of us with no semblance of order
or command the fire basket which was
the bold dragoon



kept ready kindled for night operations was
lighted and the captain arrived to take
charge of affairs on our ship they lost
a great number of men by the stairs and
when he saw he was making no headway
the french captain ordered a number of his
men back into their own ship which were
those we saw scrambling up the side again

  these men got out a boat and rowed
around under the stern where they climbed
up to our cabin windows by the scroll work
broke them in and having burst through the
cabin doors came upon us from the rear
which naturally put an end to the fighting
yes but what became of maud

  the viscount clasped his knees and rocked
back and forth on the seamans chest on
which we sat

  that was the best of all he said this
archevtque de rennes is bound for a good
long cruisc the captain took our cap-
tain and maud and her attendant spirit
doris into the french ship where they
could have more comfortable quarters i
gather he had an eye for congenial company
for he expects to be gone a year

  and what happens to us

  why we are to be into louisburg at
once

  then how are we in any better case than
those on the other ship with a chance of rot-
ting in some prison for the next two or three
years

  ah but we will be ashore in the ameri-
cas while they will be at sea and when the
cruise is over will go back to bordeaux
which is her home port so we will have
no more of troublesome claimants for our
estate

  how are we to claim it ourselves
that said the viscount is something
that must be devised

         one of the frenchmen came in
at that moment and inquired of
the viscount our names and sta-
tions on the ship which the vis-
count gave him and those of the crew the
mate had been killed and likewise the gun-
ner and all the other men of worth in the
ships company so those-that were left were
but common seamen the captain who
had a slight wound had been taken into the
french ship

  there were then five seamen and the two
of us making seven and we were taken on
deck and thrust into a hole from which some

of the cargo had been taken and having
thrown us down a few rags to cover us
against the cold the cover or hatch was
slammed on and we were left in blackness

  it was for this that we were waiting
said the viscount they took some of the
cargo from here and transhipped it not to
make room for us but because they had
need of it i suppose

  i made him no answer for in addition to
the pain of my bruises i had a heavy and a
broken heart there was that poor girl
alone and friendless a prisoner of war and
probably lost to me forever if i had had
the chance to say farewell to her to speak a
cheering word it would not have been so
bad but to part so tenderly and then never
to see her again was almost more than i
could bear

  if i had suffered when we were in the
berth and could go upon the deck when the
spirit moved us and breathe gods fresh air
and walk about at will how much more so
was i tormented in that black hole through
all those weary weeks it was wet and
fearfully cold and the air was quite un-
breatheable for the hatch would only be
taken off in fine weather which due to the
season and the fact that we had come into
the stormy latitudes was very seldom

  we slept all together on the deck huddled
close for warmth like sheep and put what
little covering we had over us in the
morning so cold and stiff would we be that
we could scarce rise during the day we
walked about and played hide-and-seek in
the darkness to keep life in our hearts and
warmth in our bodies but this was miser-
able enjoyment for the deck was so low that
we could not stand upright and the ship
rolled and pitched so tremendously that the
only way to be safe from being flung against
the side and grievously bruised was to lie
on ones back and even then it was very
hard to stay in one place

  sometimes we talked of escape and had
many plans for seizing the ship and sailing
it into a friendly port the seamen were
for the most part willing jolly fellows al-
though there was one sullen dog who would
take no part in our talk but sat cursing by
himself all day bemoaning the fact that he
had no tobacco our principal plan was to
seize one of the guards when he was bringing
our food and wrest his pistol from him but
this was not very feasible since whenever
the hatch would be opened several days


adventure

supply of food and water would be lowered
down and none ever came into our dungeon

  we thought of another scheme when we
should be on deck that each one of us should
seize the frenchman that stood nearest him
and possess himself of his enemys weapons
and then gathering ourselves into a band
make ourselves masters of the ship how-
ever on our first day on deck it was easily
seen that this could not be done

  we were kept together in a close group
with at least ten frenchmen about us all
very heavily armed and with ferocious
beards who kept wetting their knives in
on their palms and examining the locks of
their pistols with a very bloodthirsty air
throughout the time that we were above
decks

  the french lieutenant stayed upon the
poop deck very resplendent in a dark blue
coat with red facings and much gold lace
which was surprizingly bright for a priva-
teersman however when he came down
into the waist upon some matter of ship i
saw that the sleeves of his coat were a litue
overlong and that it fitted but poorly about
the shoulders so i judged that it had not
been made for its present owner

  it was at this time to my very great dis-
gust that i noticed this officer to be wear-
ing my picinino and upon his perceiving me
looking at it he rattled it very vigorously
at this discovery i could have wept and in-
deed it upset me more than the knowledge
that i would probably neversee maud again
in this life

  the torture of the noisome dungeon the
cold and the uncertainty of our fate was bad
enough but all this time the thought of that
poor girl was on my mind and i would lie
awake and wonder where she was and if any
harm had befallen her and if she were well
kept on that cursed ship

  i had no fear of hurt coming to her from
any of the french for they are a very gal-
lant race and not given to insulting un-
protected females moreover doris could
handle any of them and indeed would have
cast them all into the sea had they put any
slight upon her mistress but there were
fearful storms that raged for days and
supposing one of our cruisers came down
upon the frenchman and there was a battle
and the frenchman should be sunk what
then would become of maud these were
fearsome thoughts and kept me awake for
many a long night

  it was a long long time that we lay in the
belly of that ship all our plans of escape
came to naught for one day one of the sea-
men suggested that among us there was no
man capable of navigating a ship and that
we could not compel the french officer to
sail her for us for he would not know
whither he was taking us and he might sail
us into a french port in spite of all

  it was very shortly after this discovery
that a great storm came upon us far worse
than any we had had before the ship
rolled far down upon one side and then back
upon the other tumbling us to and fro so
that we could not sleep nor sit nor stand
nor do anything but fly from side to side
like peas in a rattle

  moreover our water keg was overset in
the darkness and all our water ran out and
none knew of it until some one cried out that
he was smitten and found that the empty
keg was rolling about and had rolled into
him we were in there then without water
an unbelievable time a most terrible time
and suffered thirst and hunger and misery
unbelievable

  we could hold no conversation with each
other because of the thunder of the seas
upon our decks and a man could not lie
down and wait patiently for the coming
of death because of being hurled about so
the water began to pour down upon us
from the hatch which had been broached
by the seas and in a very short time we
were as wet as fish

  we shouted and called but none paid us
any heed indeed i doubt if they heard
us at last there was a most terrific crash
a veritable roar of thunder the water came
in through the hatch in sheets and a wild
wailing cry came down to us from the deck

  the next moment the hatch was torn off
bodily and a white face appeared at the
opening a man called to us something
that i could not understand for i have no
french for all i have fought against them
for a goodly time but very shortly a ladder
was thrust down and we managed to struggle
up it to the deck after great effort and many
sore falls it was high time for the water
in that black hole was well over our knees
and all our bed covering was afloat in it

  when i had come upon the deck i seized
hold of a rope beside the viscount and
steadying myself as well as i could against
the motion of the ship which leaped and
plunged like a fractious horse i looked
the bold dragoon



about me -to see if there was any sign of
encouragement

  this is a terrible storm i cried in the
viscounts ear

  it is that he agreed but i have no
care how it blows

  are you mad i cried what do you
mean do you want us all to perish in
these wintry seas

  no he answered but i think that no
matter how the tempest rages or the waves
leap they leap just as high and the peril of
death is just as great where that brock-
hurst woman is

  what has she done to you i cried in
rage

  she would take my estate from ine he
answered

  whereat so great was my disgust that i
looked about for another rope to cling to so
that i might get away from him but there
was none near

  oh it was a fearsome sight that hungry
sea snow fell heavily swirling and twist-
ing and hissed in to the ocean the wind
blew with tremendous force and the ropes
moaned and shrieked as if they were in
as great terror as we enormous billows
reared their heads alongside the vessel and
shook their white locks at us and bellowed
and then lay down again and shoved the
vessel with their shoulders every now and
then one would leap aboard with a most
awful roar and curl across the decks

  the first one of these so frightened me
that i let go my hold upon the rope and so
was carried off with the rushing water and
hurled against the side of the ship it was
a mercy that i was not carried into the sea
but as it was i had a great number of new
bruises to add to those i had received after
the battle which were scarce healed and
the salt water getting into my cuts stung
most exquisitely

  after that i clung to any handhold i
could find and held my breath whenever
one of those gray lions of the sea sprang at
me the murk was so thick that one could
not see but a little ways beyond the vessels
side just far enough to perceive the first line
of billows and farther than that was just a
gray wall out of which came roarings and
hissings such as never mortal man heard
before

  in a little while the viscount came down
to where i was and putting his mouth close
to mine cried

  they have brought us up to help save
the ship if you wish to live lend a hand
at the ropes we are lost in the tempest
and are very near our death hark

  i listened and between the gusts of the
wind a faint sound of guas came to me at
regular intervals-berrooml boom berroom

a fight i shrieked at him

   tis the sea beating upon a
cruel shore he answered me
 tis the pounding of the waves
upon rocks whither we are driving madly
and if we can not keep her off we must all
perish

  then he was gone sliding down the deck
and repeating his words to the other english-
men where they clung to rope and spar

  no battle had ever half the terror of that
wild storm in battle a man has at least
a weapon to protect himself his enemy is a
man such as he and as fearful and if one is
wounded the soft ground is but a little way
but here at sea there is no defense the
waves roll on and on like charging columns
of horse and there is no stopping of them
nor any thought that this must be the last
for there are no more the seas are full of
them and one goes by to give place to a hun-
dred and there is no surrender nor any
fate but to go down beneath those cold gray
seas for miles and miles and miles and be
devoured by the fearsome monsters lurking
there

  so all that day we had a weary time of it
going now this way now that hither and
yon and the thunder of the sea upon the
land growing ever louder in our ears the
rushing wind would blow stronger and carry
it from our ears so that we would think we
were at last getting away but then there
would be a lull and the sound would be
nearer and have an exulting note in it as if
those hungry billows saw their prey already
within their grasp

  some of the french were doing what they
could to bail out the hole where we had been
but finding this impossible they had made
shift to repair the hatch and cover it over
with cloth to keep the ocean out of that
place as for me i was hounded about
the decks and when a rope was put into
my hands i pulled on it then after the
day was advanced i was put to bailing
water out of a kind of well with a bucket
on the end of a long rope this was a
heart-breaking back-rending task for there


adventure

was nothing to hold on to to secure ones
self against the heaving of the ship

  when night came upon us it was as if a
black cloth had been dropped over us the
howling of the breakers was continuously in
our ears now a terrifying most appalling
clamor so loud that a man could not hear
any other sound

  shortly after this as if by common con-
sent every one ceased doing whatever task
he was upon and let fall rope sail or bucket
and took to his prayers the lieutenant
went into the cabin and came out with some
religious picture which they carried onto
the forecastle all in a group and having
knelt down they elevated the picture and
let the ship take its course

  having no one at the helm she very soon
turned broadside to the sea and the main-
mast being weakened by a cannon shot in
it during the battle fell over the side with
its gear after that we scraped once or
twice on the sand and then were lifted high
on the sea and carried forward a great way
where the water cast us down as a wrestler
casts an adversary so that the back of the
ship was broken

  then the sea whooping and charging in
from the darkness thundered down upon
us and carried all those in the forepart of
the ship to destruction for we could hear
ihem shriek even above the wind and the
thunder of the seas

  the viscount and i and the british sea-
men not being of the religion of those who
were masters of the vessel had gone into the
after part of the poop to make our peace
with god and this part being higher than
that other was somewhat out of the path of
the seas and would be safe until the ship
should be broken in pieces

  in a very little while it was dark the
viscount and i managed to clamber down so
that we might enter the great cabin for we
thought to find some shelter there during the
night the doors that had been broken in
during the battle had only been patched and
never really put in a state of strength and
the seas that now made a clean sweep of the
deck at every surge were foaming through
them and splashing about the floor

  there were three smaller cabins that led
off from the main one and i thought with a
pang that maud had lived in one of them
and i hoped that she might be safer than i
was at that moment

  it was very cold in there and the water

was quite deep so we lost all hope of shel-
tering there until daylight even if the ship
should last that length of time the vis-
count had kindled one of the hanging lan-
thorns with his steel and as he took it down
to carry it on the deck i saw what caused
my heart to know its first joy since since the
talcing of the ship by the french my pici-
nino hung from a peg and i took it down and
belted it on with a glad heart just what i
should do with it in that time of shipwreck
and deadly peril i did not know but the
feeling of it upon my thigh gave me a great
deal of encouragement

  we splashed out with the lanthom and
when we were come to the deck found that
both ladders were gone so that we had to
get to the poop by clambering up the side of
the ship not a difficult feat since the vessel
leaned very much shoreward

  now what to do asked the viscount
we are still alive but that is the most
that can be said i wonder how far off the
shore is

  i can not see a thing i answered but
the snow and the blackness and the gallop-
ing waves i doubt if there is any one left
on the forecastle see the ocean is halfway
up the mizzen and we have not been able to
see the deck since she struck

  what are those sailors croaking about
asked the viscount pointing to where the
seamen stood in a group their heads togeth-
er i went over to them and they told me
that one of them was familiar with storms
in those latitudes and that we were prob-
ably come ashore upon the coast of new
scotland and that we had struck at slack
tide

  he said that when the high tide came it
would come with a rush and overwhelm the
ship and if we would make a raft we might
win to the shore on it we set about mak-
ing one at once but there was nothing that
we could get at to make it with the men
were able to haul up two broken masts or
yards and made some attempt to lash them
together but what with the cold and the
continuous breaking of the seas over the
deck and the black darkness for the
viscounts lanthom had been put out as
soon as we had gained the poop we could
make no headway and so the attempt was
given up

  i wonder i did not die amidst the horrors
of that fearful night we were wetted
through and through by the breaking of the
the bold dragoon



seas the cold was terrible and the part of
he deck under the bulwarks that was a
little sheltered against the waves was very
quickly filled with the driving snow ex-
ceeding wet and uncomfortable

  a man meets his fate in gods blessed
daylight with a light heart but it is ill wait-
ing to die in the fearful blackness of the
night with a howling storm and hungty
waves bellowing and the surf thundering
beyond the wall of darkness

  i think some of the seasmen died during
the night but of that i can not be sure the
viscount and i huddled beneath my great
coat and sang lustily to keep ourselves alive
the night seemed endless we sang three
ladies from france lango lee and a
great many songs of the camp which he did
not know but could carry the chorus we
sang and sang with the taste of the salt sea
in our mouths until our throats were very
near to cracking

  i remember that at this time i bethought
me how thirsty we had been in our dungeon
but upon coming out of it we had felt no
thirst nor had i had any drink for a long
time but it did not bother me i suppose it
was from the continuous wetting of the sea

  of a sudden the viscount gave a cry

  look he shouted the day comes

  it was even as he said we could see a
grayness in the night and the lower side of
the deck was visible with the body of a man
washing to and fro in the water there there
were three more all close together in the
corner behind the helm but whether they
were alive or dead i could not tell

  the ship moaned and cried and we could
hear timbers crashing and the hungry water
lapping in the cabin under us i tried to
stand but could not being so stiff with the
cold and indeed i had no great desire to
rise being very comfortable where i was and
having a pleasant warmth begin to steal up-
on me with a most enticing desire to sleep
at this time i was very close to death al-
though i did not know it at the time but the
sea that had nearly been the end of me was
my salvation

  the deck gave a sudden lurch under us
and then came away from the far side of the
ship like the crust of a pasty from its dish
i caught hold of the upper side of the bul-
wark and felt the ship lift under me just as
a great mountain of a wave leaped down
upon us i was very near strangled and
torn from my hold and then i felt another

  

great heave upward my head came out in
air for a second and i saw huge waves and
a great many timbers sticking up out of
the sea like swimming dogs and then i
went down again

  i could think most clearly all the while
and i knew that if i could get hold of one of
those timbers i should be saved for it would
keep me above water at that moment
something struck me a fearful blow in the
side which i instinctively caught hold of
and found my head above water nor did it
go under again before i could get the
water from my eyes another wave dashed
over me and i was compelled to let go but
whatever it was that held me up did not go
from under my arm and in a moment my
head was free again i shook my head and
then opened my eyes

  the viscount was looking directly into
my face he was upon one side of a great
spar and i on the other and his hands were
locked in the collar of my coat so that
we both hung across the spar the water
rushed over my head again and i have no
recollection of what transpired after save
that at times i could breathe and at times
i was strangled i know that often i felt
ground under my feet but each time i was
swept away and could not come up on the
land

  after a long long time i discovered that
i could breathe freely and that the sea broke
over me no more then i have a dim re-
membrance of trying to get to my feet but
being bound down by something of falling
down into the shallow water a great many
times and of battling with some one but
it was very indistinct like a poorly remem-
bered dream and i can not be certain of
what did take place

chapter ix

of the quests ending

there was a very pleasant warmth
about me and a feeling of security i
held my breath for a time for i feared at any
minute the sea would clash over me and
strangle me but it did not and i heard
some one moving and smelt a very strong
smell of fish when i heard the crackling
of wood i opened my eyes there was a
vast maze of ropes over my head that i
thought must be the wreckage of our masts
but after i had puzzled at them for some


adventure

time i perceived them to be nets such as
fishermen use there were oars there and
cages and a great many things that i did
not know the use of

  i tried to lift my head but could not be-
ing too weak and then i essayed to turn
upon my side but that was likewise impos-
sible at this a very red-faced man heavily
bearded came and looked at me with con-
cern and having propped up my head
poured a great quantity of burning liquid
very pleasant to the taste down my throat
and then left me

  i awakened several times after that and
each time was treated to a dose of the hot
liquor and finally was able to stay awake
and even to call out weakly at this the
red-faced man appeared and another as like
him as two peas and the first one asked me
with a very strange accent how i found my-
self

  very well i replied where is this
place

  why this is cape cod he answered
right nigh chatham

  is this in french territory

  the bearded man laughed very heartily

   no taint he said

  then i inquired die time of day and was
told it was about eight in the morning

  why i havent been here very long
have i i asked i came ashore about
daylight

  the two men laughed some more at

this

  ye been here a week young fellar
said the second one an i shouldnt

wonder if ye stayed here the rest o the
winter

  after i had chewed this in my mind a
while i asked the man to tell me in full how
he had found me and where i was and if
there was any hope for others in the ships
company

  well now said he speaking with such
a strange accent and with so many uncouth
words that i could scarce follow him it
come on to blow quite a spell back there
was a lot of wind and the sea was pretty
rough and come up way over the marsh
il blew off and on for more than a week and
then come on to snow

  about the second day of the snow i
went down to see if the tide was gettin up
fer if it got too high it might take me an the
shack fer a cruise it was quite a ways up
the beach and i pulled a boat i had there

out of the way of it then this old fellar
come down that night and said twas so
thick the people had give up hope of seein
any ships that day and had gone home he
lives to chatham where they make quite a
piece out of what the sea brings em in the
way of wrecks now obediah you tell the
rest on it

  the other man grinned in an embarrassed
way

  why taint nuthin he said i
stayed here that night bein the storm was
so high and early in the mornin i took a
turn along the beach for if any ship had
come ashore during the night thered be
bits of her floatin about well i seed sure
enough there was one and she wouldnt be
much use either for she was all broken to
bits there was a few kegs and a lot of
broken timber but nary else till i come
on you and that other fellar under a
yard

  here he pointed and i turned my head
and there on mattresses on the floor were
the viscount and the french lieutenant the
first asleep but the second with his eyes
open although he did not understand a
word for he had no english as i after-
ward found out

  he had liis hands all twisted up in your
collar where hed grabbed holt and the wa-
ter had spun you around and like to cut his
wrists off the two of ye was caught across
the yard and that was probably what saved
ye that other feller how he come ashore
i dont know fer we found him in the snow
and he was all frost-bit when we lugged him
here we been down to the beach every
day fer a week but nobody else come ashore
alive there was some that we laid out in
the snow till come spring and the ground
gels soft and then well bury em

  what did you ligger on doin with that
sword there that load of iron would drag
a whale under

  i looked where he pointed and saw my
picinino very rusty but still unbroken
standing in a corner

  as long as that was saved i cried i
have no care for anything else

  ye nigh killed that other fellar that
sword swung around so it cut him all to
bits i looked again at the viscount and
found that his head and face were badly
cut and indeed it must have been from
the picinino swinging about and striking
him
the bold dragoon



the viscount came to himself
some time later and was very glad
to find himself alive he and i
told the two men that had res-
cued us how we had come to be upon the
vessel and who the frenchman was the
viscount conversed with the lieutenant in
french and said that the lieutenant felt
that he was very near death and requested
us to send his watch and the buttons from
his uniform to his mother in paulliac near
bordeaux

  he had been washed over the side after
we were indeed the men on the forecastle
had lived throughout the night thinking us
all dead even as we had thought them but
when the ship was broken up they must
have all perished

  the officer said that he had climbed up
the foremast and lashed himself to it and
had so come to land where he remembered
wandering in the snow indeed he was ter-
ribly bitten by the frost and his hands and
feet were quite black after a lingering a
while in great pain he died and was taken
out to wait until the ground should be soft
enough to bury him

  the viscount had had his foot crushed by
the yard falling upon it on the beach so we
perforce stayed with the two men until he
could walk which was very nearly two
months

  the two men who lived in the hut were
fishers one named obadiah hallet and the
other benjamin sprague we had two
mattresses to sleep on spread upon the floor
and plenty of salt fish to eat so that by the
time we were able to go i had grave doubts
but what i should sprout fins

  has it occurred to you asked the vis-
count one day when he could hobble about
a little how happily things have befallen
us

  it surely has i agreed who would
have thought that the picinino would have
stayed with me all that time and not burst
its fastenings or to go farther back who
would have dreamed that i should ever get
it back again from the french

  that cursed sword to - with it

do you see these new scars it made those
while i was holding your silly head above
water can you think of nothing else but
that sword

  aye i said sadly i am wondering
what has become of maud

  confound the man he roared by the

feet of timothy i think he is quite daft
and has lost what few brains he ever had
do you know what brought us here in the
first place do you remember why we left
england

  it was something to do with an estate
was it not but i think we have small
chance of getting it now that the papers are
all lost

  hear him who said the papers were
lost i am not such a lack-wit as you are
did i not forsee perils upon the deep and
the danger of shipwreck and thieves
look here he reached into his bosom
and drew out a leathern case all twisted and
cracked from the sea water

  our honest fishermen had opened it
said he but they found that it contained
naught but a bar of wax so they put it
back again he drew out a great lump of
wax flat like a plate and looking very much
like a thick book he had worn this under
his clothes and now that i thought upon it
i had remarked a fullness to his chest on
several occasions

  the frenchdesired it of me he con-
tinued but i told them it was a sacred
unguent from st nicholas of bari in italy
so they left it me

  what is all this wandering speech
about i interrupted

  hand me that knife

  i passed him the knife and he began to
very carefully peal and cut away the wax
after some time i saw what he was about
he had the papers regarding the estate in
that block of wax was not that a happy
thought he cried i sealed them up
the day before we came from england and
they have come safe and dry through the
battle and the wreck and very soon when
i am able to walk i shall be a rich man
 shall

  well of course so shall you for you
have helped me

  this he said carelessly but i marked his
lips tighten and a shift of his eyes and i
thought in my heart that there was dirt
about to be done and made up my mind that
i would be the one who would do it

  affairs took on a brighter turn now we
had come ashore in the latter part of decem-
ber indeed i think it was the day before
christmas and during january and febru-
ary we stayed with the fishers the viscount
burning to be away but forced to wait
until he could walk


adventure

  he had found that boston the port to
which we were bound was but a few days
journey to the north but we were forced to
wait through march till the roads were
passable but when april came it was im-
possible to hold him any longer

  was it not the greatest of luck said he
to have that wonderful storm that would
blow that ship all the way from canada
to the coast of new england and then cast
her away right where we wanted to land
truly he cried my fortune has changed
at last

  as soon as the road would permit travel
we engaged a carter who made weekly
trips to boston to take us up with him
we said farewell to the fishers and would
have paid for our entertainment save that
we had not a shilling between us and so
told the two fishers but they showed no
surprize i doubt not but what they knew
it as well as we having gone through our
clothes when they had them off of us to dry

jus the journey was a long one
       taking the better part of a fort-
       night and we lay each night in

  ---- the cart at last we were come

into boston so called after saint botolph
and it is very like a town in england we
inquired for an inn and the carter said that
the bunch of grapes was a good one and
showed us the way thither

  it was after dark and there were few
people on the streets when we were come
to the inn we went into the common room
it was high and long with benches around
the sides and a great cloud of smoke
there were a great many men in there and
one stood on a stool and harangued them

  whos for adventure he cried whos
to go to the north and smoke the rogues
out like woodchucks out of a hole step
up and sign the scroll and strike a blow for
king and fireside

  he went on to tell of the generous pay and
the opportunities for advancement and that
arms would be furnished at the governors
expense and all the rest of the blandish-
ments of a recruiter while we stood at
the outskirts of the crowd a man plucked
me by the sleeve and requested speech of
me

  you are a likely fellow he began i
knew it the moment you came in the door
even if i had not seen your sword that was
made to drink blood with will you have

a glass of wine and then shall i put your
name down

  not so fast i told him i have no
desire to go back across the sea again hav-
ing but newly come ashore tell me are
we really at war with france

  yes a ship from england brought us
the news the morning

  well i have done enough of fighting in
france for a while

   why this is not for fighting in france
he cried but in canada we must suc-
cor the garrison at canseau it is but a
short sail along the coast it is a very rich
place and lightly held and i have heard
he said winking that the young ladies
there are very handsome

  no said i not just now i have
other matters that must be looked to first
and anyway i have no desire to be a com-
mon soldier again a little of that goes
a great way when i want to starve to
death i will do it comfortably in a ditch
and not in the army moreover i am but
lately home from flanders and i expect
to come into an estate

  if you should change your mind said
the other man ask for sergeant withington
and  will see that you are taken care of
lets break away from this crowd
said the viscount and see about getting a
bed and something to eat

  we then inquired for the landlord and a
man in a white shirt and coatless left a
group that were discussing something with
great animation and came over to us

  well sirs said he with no great cordi-
ality

  we would like a bed my good man
said the viscount and something to eat
and a bottle of your best if it could be
had in a hurry we would like it the better
for we have been all day upon the road
the host looked at us up and down and
across he had very small gray eyes and
a long face and seemed not a whit impressed
by the viscount i felt that he could not
be blamed for the viscount was dirty and
bearded and his coat hung upon his breast
for he had cut off the buttons which were
of silver and given them to the carter for
bringing us to boston i suppose i was in
little better case the landlord got a can-
dle from the wall and peered at us by its
light

  any baggage he asked speaking down
his long nose in a most curious way
the bold dragoon



  why we have been shipwrecked said
the viscount and lost everything we
owned

  its customary to pay in advance in
such a case said the landlord

  why we have no money answered the
viscount but that need not hinder our
getting food and lodging for i am the
nephew and only heir of matthew tuppcr
of whom perhaps you have heard

  the landlord did not seem the least im-
pressed

  i knew of him he said nodding he
has been dead some time then he looked
at the picinino very hard ye beant
from the highlands be ye he asked look-
ing at us out of the corner of his eye and
making a round o with his mouth as though
he had said something very smart

  why no i answered him what
makes you think so

  about twenty year back when i was
younger and more foolish than i be naow
a passel o young fellers come here with
swords like that un and i give em bed and
board but they lit aout withaout settlin
they didnt git very fur and i had em put
in the stocks they was runaway high-
landers they was and i aint never trusted
a man from scotland sence

   you can put us in the stocks if we dont
pay the viscount broke in

  that wont put any money in my pocket
thats been paid aout for yewr vittles

   but i tell you that as soon as i see the
solicitor or lawyer that handles my estate
i will have plenty of money dont you
believe i am mr tuppers nephew

  yew may be i dont know thar was
a young sprout in here last week wanted
credit fer a pipe o wine when i wouldnt
give it to him said he was governor shir-
leys son i believed him he didnt
git no credit though i believe yew
yew may be a rich man but yew caint
git anything in this haouse without yew
pay fer it in advance

   be -to you then said the vis-
count ill come back here tomorrow and
buy your old tavern and put you out into
the street

   taint for sale cried the landlord after
us as we went out

  we stood helplessly in the street after
this and the viscount chewed his fingers
and cursed me

   if it had not been for that doubly cursed

swofrd again we might have gotten supper
and perhaps a bed

  the sword had nothing to do with it
said i it was our own fault lets go
back to the carter perhaps hell let us
sleep in the wagon

  so we went back to where we had left the
carter after some difficulty in finding the
place and found nothing save a number of
carts and empty wagons we crawled
into one of  these and covering ourselves
with some old sacks passed a very uncom-
fortable night having had nothing to eat
all day

with the coming of dawn our
spirits rose again this was the
day that we had come all these
weary miles to see the day for
which we had braved a debtors prison the
traitors rope and the perils of the wintry
ocean we washed in a horse trough and
did what we could to make each others
apparel presentable

  the viscount examined his papers and
scraped bits of the wax from them they
were now rather frayed and worn with
places here and there where the ink had
run but were still readable they were
all there but he kept them in his hand for
a moment in their leathern case

  i wish said he that you would leave

that-sword behind for it has brought

us nothing but ill luck since the day we first
met

  where would i leave it i asked him
we may have to sell it to buy food
little fear he replied

  he stood a moment and then started off
according to the scroll of the will the origi-
nal was in the possession of one james
huckins on cornhill and to this place we
inquired our way

  when we had found the place there was
no one there and we hung about the street
for three or four hours until a clerk came
and took down the shutters this one told
us upon inquiry that mr huckins did busi-
ness up one pair of stairs and that he would
not arrive until ten oclock this meant
another weary wait and at last a little
vinegar-countenanced man skipped out of
a carriage and went up the stair

  that is he said the viscount we
had best wail a while and then go in
now he continued looking slyly at me
there is a plan i think i should tell you of


 adventure

do you not think thehonorable george
brockhurst should have his companion or
secretary carry his papers for him and wait
without until summoned

  why yes i agreed heartily that
is just the thing i will do it gladly

  the viscount somewhat surprized that
i did not object handed me the leather
case containing the scroll of the will and
the scroll of the parish register and the let-
ter from the agent in london

  now when i call to you you shall come
in and present me the papers

  i understand said i

  then the viscount went up the stair
i drew out the papers and examined them
especially the letter from the loudon agent
at the top of which was the honorable
georges signature although it was the
viscount who had written it there the ink
of this had run so that it might be anything
and i was much pleased at that fact

  maud i said to myself for thy sake
i am blackening my countenance and put-
ting mine honor to blush but  believe it is
for the right then i slapped the hilt of
the picinino and strode off up the street
after a goodly time i went back to the
place where i had left the viscount and up
the stair

  there was a small room within cluttered
with rolls of paper and great books be-
hind a desk sat the vinegar-countenanced
man looking very bored and opposite him
the viscount chewing his fingers and quite
red and embarrassed

  why here is the man now he shouted
as i came in where have you been
guzzling ale ill warrant what do you
mean by going off when i directed you to
wait

  i looked at him very coldly

  i crave your pardon said i but i
have business with mr huckins if this be
he and i regret that i have not the pleasure
of your acquaintance

  are you mad he shrieked give
me my papers i paid him no heed but
advancing to the desk handed the papers
to the lawyer

  if you will have the goodness to examine
these said i you will see that i am the
honorable george brockhurst heir to the
estate of matthew tupper deceased and
as for this man here i know nothing of
him save that he is some poor demented
wretch

  the lawyer examined the papers care-
fully i see that there is a place here for
a signature but the signature is unreadable
hmm very strange indeed both of you
lay claim to the estate but it would seem
that the one that hath the papers is the
rightful heir how is it that you appear in
such disreputable fashion

  i was shipwrecked i said

  i have told all that cried the viscount
this man is an imposter why he is my

servant-him i told you of him did

i not

  i think this gentleman here has the right
of it the other said nodding to the vis-
count for he told me he had the papers and
left them with his servant both of you
may be lying there is no way to tell

  he continued at some length to my great
discomfort questioning us shrewdly and
our stories agreed perfectly save that we
both claimed to be the honorable george

  i believe it to be a case for wiser heads
than mine said the lawyer at last and
if there were enough of an estate to pay the
costs i should turn it over to the courts
however we will have in the legacy and
mayhap we can come to some agreement
he went into a closet while the viscount
and i looked at each other with slack jaws

  then the lawyer returned bringing with
him a small wooden box which he placed
upon the desk and opened

  you must know said the lawyer
that mr tupper beggared himself to send
whichever one of you is his nephew to the
university always hoping that his fortunes
would mend he did not intend to die as
earlv as he did be that as it may when
the estate was settled and the debts satis-
fied this is all that was left

  then he opened the box and took out a
silver box for snuff a chain and a seal ring
this he put down on the table and added a
pair of silver buckles quite badly tarnished

  perhaps you can come to some agree-
ment said mr huckins but i must re-
mind you that i am a busy man

a long long time we stood
i feeling very foolish and shamed
i had thought to seize the estate
myself and then find maud by
hook or crook and tell her that it was hers il
she would but come and take it but there
was no estate after all

  give my share to the poor or throw
the bold dragoon



it out of the window i said and went
down the stair

  now where cried a voice i turned
and there was the viscount at my shoulder
no hard feelings he said smiling we
have lost and let us forget it i intended
to lay the blame on you say that you
were the viscount and that i was hugh
bancroft if anything went wrong and we
were detected it was for that reason i
gave you the papers so i hold it not
against you that you tried to steal the
estate it would not have worked you
know as we wandered off up the street
we have been seen too much together and
there would always be the chance that the
captain of the gull who was taken into the
french ship would arrive and expose you
how are we to eat i inquired

  the viscount seized my arm in a grip of
iron

  roast me in - he whispered in

awful tones look

  just below us was a shop and at the hip-
ping stone a gorgeous carriage a lady
stepped on the stone and so into the car-
riage the two footmen leaped behind
quickly the lady might come out of that
shop lightly she might step into her coach
but not so quickly and not so lightly but
what i should know her it was maud
brockhurst

  sold cried the viscount his lips white
sold she has beaten us to the legacy
after all back to that lying lawyer back
i say and well have the truth though we
drag it from his lying throat

  not so fast i said not so fast i
went on to the shop the viscount at my
elbow and scraping after the coach

  who was that lady that just drove off
i inquired

  the man turned with a smile that
changed to a look of disdain when he saw
our ragged clothes and bearded cheeks
who are you he demanded

  we are poor shipwrecked mariners i
informed him and the lady looks like a
relative of mine

  ah he said why she is the wife
of my lord dudley she were on her way
from england when the ship she were in
were taken by the french ilis majestys

ship lion fell in with the french ship and
she were rescued and brought here very
ill from seasickness and so her case came
to the notice of my lord dudley and he
fell in love with her and married her this
day week

  her husband was killed in flanders
you say

  aye at dettingen and manys the tale
she can tell of his battles the honorable
george brockhurst were his name and she
expected to be taken into her husbands
uncles house but he died a bankrupt a
long time back and she had nowhere to
go then he went into his shop and banged
the door

  i looked at the viscount

  and now i asked

  he chewed his fingers

  i think i will call upon the lady maud
he muttered not looking at me but across
the street after all she is an old school-
mate of mine and may have her husband
find me a competence

  i chewed this in my mind and would
have struck him but i refrained

  for a long while said i i have won-
dered whether you were a very brave man
or a very great scoundrel and now i know
you are neither but a poor sop of a man
that i would not soil my foot with kicking
then i turned my back upon him and
went up the street at my best pace clanking
the picinino on the stones when i came
to the turn i looked back the viscount
was going in the direction the coach had
taken limping slightly from the hurt he
had gotten in the wreck

  so here was the end no money no
estate and no maud a husband who
had died in flanders forsooth well i
still had a sword and knew a use to which
it could be put i turned down the next
street and up and then down and finally
found my way back to the bunch of grapes
i found sergeant withington

  sergeant i said stepping over to the
table touching the matter of this ven-
ture to canada if there is still an oppor-
tunity to join then here is a sword that is
weary of being worn with civilian attire
and i slammed the picinino down on the
table so that the glasses rang

the end
author of the cmemari

n the passenger list he was just
w teague a quiet young fellow
a cableman and on his way to his
first foreign station he had a
round piuk-and-white baby face and was
still in his teens a clean domestic odor of
kitchen washing-soap and bread and butter
persisted about his person despite the strong
lift of the biscayan breezes he had a split
projecting front tooth that pushed his upper
lip out ever so slightly and this peculiarity
when he opened his mouth to ask his naive
boyish questions seemed to emphasize his
innocence his youthfulness to an extraor-
dinary degree

  as wilberforce teague surveyed the
mighty gray lion-couchant of gibraltar
from the deck of the small hall liner his
heart sank within him a curious sinking
feeling resulting from his first definite con-
tact with the great outer world the first
realization of his own absolute non-impor-
tance before the broader vista of a different
world as dimly comprehended in the swarthy
upturned faces of the bumboatmen the hub-
bub of strange tongues the leonine rock and
the low green hills of spain a long way off
to the north and west across the scintillating
blue of the bay

  yet within a short six months teague had
grown as much at his ease as the most blase
of his fellow exiles on the rock wilberforce
teague was the son of a yorkshire country
parson a kindly country parson completely
possessed with and surrounded by the pro-
verbially large family

  teague was a mild and unassuming young
fellow and his manners and education par-
took more of the parsonage than the college
variety the only occasion on which his
mother had seen him really excited had been
once when he took off his coat and bared his
slim arms to fight a huge and hairy carter
for brutally thrashing a horse in a country
lane not a hundred miles from kingston-
upon-hull

  the carter had jeered at the boy in his
breezy yorkshire way and pushed him not
too brutally in the mud whereat mrs
teague good soul had wiped the mud from
her sons clothes and mother and son had
gone home to tea at the rectory the son pro-
foundly dejected at this crowning insult to
his budding adolescence and the mothers
heart singing silent pteans of joy at these
signs of incipient manhood in her boy this
sudden injection of romance into her quiet
later days

  teague loved all animals especially
horses and dogs the mute nobility of
horses appealed to him almost as much
as the pally humanity of his sealyham
terrier

  and after six quiet months at gib the
great day arrived for wilberforce teague
the great day of his leap from comparative
obscurity into fame into the controversy
of two countries and the headlines of two
continents any man less earnest and less
honest of purpose would have turned back
halfway but not teague

  that modest young man possessed a



bullfight

perry cfaatfos chandler
the bullfight



curious consistency of character a strange
constitutional obstinacy doubly strange in
one of his seemingly plastic easy-going
nature it was impossible for teague to
turn back once he had set his hand to the
plow-or to his signature the beginning
of it was the bullfight at linea or to give
that place its full name linea de la con-
cepcion the town that has grown up on the
old spanish military lines of perpetual siege
across the neutral territory from gibraltars
north front

  on sunday september th in the plaza de
toros of linea the renowned espada rodrigo
robles robclito assisted by his splendid cuadriua
will kill six magnificent bulls of the insuperable herd
of the marques de lands prices one peso in the
sun two pesos in the shade

  so the bills read and teague reading
them decided that he had better go and see
a bull-fight just to be able to say that he
had seen one he went with jones and
walker the latter his particular chum the
glittering bespangled matadors stride in to
the lively strains of the machaquito march
and teague immediately feels himself in
another world in another age

  the president of the bull-ring the alcalde
of linea tosses the keys of the ring down
from his seat a mounted picador catches
them deftly in his cap and hands them to
robles who strikes a theatrical attitude as
he makes his small set speech then the
military band breaks into the quickstep of
the spanish national anthem the cuadriua
of the renowned robles distribute them-
selves about the ring and the crowd oils
perfunctorily

  they are bored with these formalities
and want to see the bull dead silence as
the low wooden gates of the arena barrier
swing inwards to make as lane to that
other gate set in the stone of the ringside
a wooden gate set in an arched culvert
of the stone a gate that opens to let out
the first bull just as it will open six
times that hot afternoon to let out the six
superior bulls of the marques de larios
one by one

  let them out from dark blindness into
the glare of the sanded arena to be
baited and tormented in the dazzling sun-
light and through their agony back to
the glazing-eyed blindness of death again
the culvert gate closes the barrier gate
closes the circle of the arena is made
complete

- hum of excitement as the bull
walks unsteadily into the light
of a sudden the bull spies the red
cape of a capeador his head
goes up as he canters toward the mark
then down goes the head the canter be-
comes a charge the capeador runs and vaults
easily over the barrier the bull frisks play-
fully before the spot where the man disap-
peared then turns to charge a new enemy
a hum of talk the wine sellers and other
itinerant vendors who ply their trade in the
narrow space between stone ringside and
wooden barrier raise their wares and their
voices to the tiers of faces above them

  teague and his friends buy three bottles
of the cheap red wine teague is enthusias-
tic all the glamor the romance of spain
seems to enter into his genial soul with
the noise the sun the colors and the wine
ah the preliminary cape play is over and
for the first time teague notices the horses
backed against the barrier in a pitiful circle
of six around the ring

  he cannot see a great deal of the horses
for they are absurdly small animals and the
picadors who ride them with their legs
sheathed in stiff leather to the thighs seem
such big fellows by comparison a cape-
ador plays the bull nearer and ever nearer
to one of the horses this is teagues first
bull-fight

  bull-fights are so common in that part
of the world that nobody has troubled to
explain to teague just exactly what a bull-
fight is he had always imagined it to be
some sort of a dodging business between the
matadors and the bull he grows intensely
interested as the bull paws the ground a bare
six paces from the horse

  surely now there will be a pretty playl
poor teague is due for a sad disillusionment
why doesnt the picador loose the reins and
canter his horse proudly away from the
barrier and into the center of the ring where
it will have ample room to maneuver the
picador raises his stout wooden lance the
point of the lance is blunted against pierc-
ing too deep into the bulls hide teague
is breathing hard and the perspiration rolls
in big drops down his smooth pink cheeks
he is most painfully engrossed in the spec-
tacle before him and the bull charges

  the lance slides harmlessly over its glossy
back its long curved horns go down to the
very ground its head is under the horses
belly then the tremendous head shoots


adventure

savagely up so great the strength in that
heaving neck that horse and rider are lifted
in air dear off the ground there must be
some mistake here thought teague this
was surely an accident and not to be
considered as part of the play and he
groaned dismally at the incredible thing
he had seen

  the bull shakes its horns free and the
horse falls on its side the picador falls to
barrierward of his steed leaving that sadly
disembowelled object still between him and
the wrathful bulk capeadors run up boldly
enticing the bull away to another part of the
arena some assistants run in and lift up
the fallen picador he points at his horse
and an animated conversation ensues

  they are arguing as to whether the horse
is worth sewing up for another round in-
forms jones who has seen many bull-fights
one of the assistants kneels and appears to
be conducting a minute examination of the
horses interior the horse raises a pathetic
head of terror-stricken eyes sideways from
the sand it seems to be mutely appealing
to all those people against further prolonga-
tion of its agony

  all this time teague is scarcely able to
breathe so great is the emotion within him
the kneeling man finally draws a short knife
with which he puts tie horse out of its
misery by a stroke somewhere in the head
teagues blood seems boiling with indigna-
tion so obsessed has he been with the
cruelty of the spectacle that he is spared the
sight of precisely a similar thing happening
on the distant side of the ring

  he has been warned against making any
show of his feelings he has been told that
the spaniards strongly resent any criticism
of the national sport if these hyper-criti-
cal and super-civilized ingleses didnt care
about bull-fights then let them stay away
from them that was the spanish point of
view it appeared that two horses would
be sufficient for that bull he had nasty
horns and even decrepit cab-horses are
expensive when they cant be patched up
again

  the batideriueros come up with their ban-
der ill as wooden darts with barbed metal
points and covered with gaudy paper stream-
ers the play is pretty something sport-
ing about this for the banderillero must
play the bull into charging from close range
directly at him and at the precise moment
when the horns seem about to touch him

step lightly aside and plunge one or if he can
both his darts into the bulls cogote the
hump behind the neck

  one of the men succeeds in placing both
his darts in the charging bull well and truly
placed on top of the hump a rare feat
the crowd ols tremendously they are
now seeing something really artistic walker
and jones applaud loudly teague applauds
less loudly he appreciates the sporting as-
pect of the thing but his thoughts are bitter
with the recollection of a certain dying
horse

  ensues more capeador play the bull
now feels the strain of half an hour of unin-
terrupted chasing and charging he paws
the ground less proudly and there are times
when the red cape shoved into his very nos-
trils merely bores him into turning his shag-
gy head the other way

  rodrigo robles stands silently apart he
is the master matador of all spain he be-
longs to the rings of madrid barcelona and
seville but condescends to kill a few bulls
at linea and algeciras during the winter
and at his own price he makes a sign to
one of the attendants who immediately
hands him a straight rapier-like sword

  robles draws the blade and bends it in his
hands he approaches the palco of the
alcalde and removing his small cap bows
ostentatiously to that gentlemen and to the
ladies seated to right and left of him he
raises his naked rapier high in air and hold-
ing it thus paces rapidly around his side of
the ring bowing to the crowd shrieking
down at him

he has a second who is prob-
ably as good a man with the bulls
as he is but robles has decided
to kill the first bull himself he
will allow his chief assistant the second one
this is the moment of his supreme glory
he walks like an athlete and he is one
through the tight silk stockings can be seen
every muscle of the legs as he steps in short
springy jerks over the sandy arena in his
swaying stride is written all the glory and
all the arrogance of spam his face is dark
andalusian brown inscrutable moor and
intelligent latin blending in his slightly
supercilious features

  when he smiles his white teeth flash
against the contrast of his swarthy face but
he is not smiling now he is about a serious
business and on the results of the next few
the bullfight



minutes the whispering crowd will be as
ready to condemn in no uncertain condem-
nation as to hail him master matador of
spain robles throws his cap to an assis-
tant he arranges the glistening pigtail of
his hair as carefully as any woman he
covers his sword with his red cape

  a capeador has played the tired bull duti-
fully to within ten paces of the master
robles walks up to the animal and holds
the cape before its nose the shaggy head
droops to the ground the matador deliber-
ately jerks the animals head up with the
cape-covered flat of his sword and the bull
makes a feeble protesting charge of about
two yards but its head comes up and
robles has attained his object-to inject an
appearance of action into these last few
seconds of the play

  he stands directly before the bull leaning
slightly to the right withdrawing the sword
from the cape and extending the blade over
the bulls head as though about to give it an
accolade but he is really judging the su-
preme moment ah he has the spot-a
fleshy spot over the left horn he places
the point of the blade tentatively over the
spot he rises on his toes he extends his arm
up and the blade flashes down down down
its entire glittering length lost in the brown
body of the victim the bull has started at
this sudden pang of lightning invading its
vitals but robles has allowed for that he
steps lightly aside withdrawing the red blade
from the body as he does so the stricken
animal stumbles over its forelegs stupidly
slumps over on its side and dies

  within ten seconds it has ceased to
breathe and in another minute it is stiff its
sturdy legs sticking out before it it is a
perfect kill through the heart pandemoni-
um breaks out among the audience scores
of the straight-brimmed spanish hats sail
into the ring from all sides cigars silver
pieces hats appear all over the sandy arena
the lesser members of the cuadrilla pocket
the cigars and the money the hats are re-
turned whizzing unerringly through the air
each hat appears to find its legitimate owner
by means of some subtle and mysterious sign
language not to be understood by gross
nordics

  there is an etiquette about all this
robles struts unconcernedly around the
ring only if the president or some other
prominent man in the audience has thrown
his hat into the ring robles has noted it

and he condescends to return that particular
hat with his own hands

  an attendant runs in with a glass of iced
wine another offers the great man a ciga-
ret robles sips the wine takes two puffs
at the cigaret and motions for the entry
of the next bull

  so died six bulls and fifteen horses that
sunny andalusian sunday all the bulls
were not so lucky as the first for some-
times the sword misses the heart and enters
the lungs to be sent spinning back high in
the air with a spurt of blood at the bulls
next breath and that of course must
make dying very painful

  one of the bulls was so full of vim and
so annoyed at one of the banderillos that he
pursued that gentleman as he leapt the
barrier the bull projecting his tremendous
weight of bone and brawn over the five-foot
barrier after his tormentor that indeed
was a sight to see por inside that barrier
are always a host of people guardia civiles
soldiers policemen itinerant vendors lot-
tery ticket sellers and what not

  the guardia civiles are all picked men
reputed the bravest men in spain but
they ran just as everybody else ran when
bull number five leapt the barrier that day
they shouted they panicked they jammed
in fighting-mad jams in the narrow passage
way they crawled and they vaulted into the
arena some were not so quick as the
others came a loud shout from somebody
in the audience immediately above the bull
of the leaping propensities

  there is a man under the bull being
gored to death

  a gloomy chorus of wo from ten thousand
throats a wail of ays of mi madres
a rustle of ten thousand standing up of
alarms and excursions and rushings to
and fro one toothless leather-faced old
muleteer old enough to be the father of any
person in that audience did not wail or
panic

  one grim-faced old man-and rodrigo
robles robles and the old muleteer
tumbled over the barrier together there
are about six places in the barrier where
gates may be opened into the ring a sign
from robles to an attendant and one of
these gates is opened the matador takes
a firm hold of the bulls tail but he is un-
able to move the animal from its horrible
preoccupation of smashing its horns into
something on the ground space is very
adventure



limited so the old muleteer stands before
the bull a bare pace from the plunging head
and speaks to it

  the bulls head comes up and the old
man places his two hands under its mouth
and exerts a gentle backward pressure
robles tugs at its tail the bull under-
stands they want him to back up he
backs and the next moment is pulled and
thrust through the gate and back into the
arena a man stands up from the ground

  he climbs to the top of the barrier to
exhibit a miracle to the audience the coat
and shirt are torn from his back a bare
white back without a scratch upon it the
bulls horns had plunged to right and left of
his body tearing every scrap of clothing
from his back but leaving him untouched
he is a soldier of the local garrison he is
trying to say something the crowd ask
each other-what is he saying the
soldiers words are passed around the ring
with roars of laughter the soldier is com-
plaining that now he will have to explain to
king alfonso the meaning of this torn uni-
form

  the spirit of comedy enters into the au-
dience some hundreds of pesetas are
thrown into the ring they are carefully
gathered up and presented to robles that
gentleman takes a bill from his own pocket
and adds it to the sum he runs over to the
hysterically grinning soldier on the barrier
presenting him with more real money than
that fortunate fellow would receive in pay in
five years

  the two are shaking hands the great

robles the confidant of princes and a com-
mon soldier tumultuous cheers tragedy
comedy the lordly condescension of the
peoples hero-and so back to drama and
possibly tragedy again spain and the
very essence of it hypocritical and mock-
heroic arrogant cruel to the point of sav-
agery but with the saving grace of humor
the genius for generosity and the manly
virtues of high courage and the disdain of
death-and life-through it all

wilberforce teague
meditated long and deeply on
bull-fighting in the silence of his
room in gibraltar that night his
mind was in a turmoil could such things
be possible in a civilized world it was not
only the actual cruelty of the bull-ring that
obsessed him but the atmosphere of the

whole thing the blood the wine the glaring
sun the mute agony of the slaughtered
horses the cruel dark faces of the men the
drunken orgies and blatant women in the
little cantinas of linea glimpsed fleetingly
on his homeward way

  the sum of the whole produced in him a
feeling of depression unlike anything that he
had ever fell in his life before and so he
pondered long into the night until his mind
evidently made up on some definite point
he got up from his bed and seating himself
at a small writing lable he began to write

  the gibraltar chronicle the semi-
official two-page news sheet of the town
appeared the following afternoon as usual
in the middle column of the back page was
an extraordinary announcement so ex-
traordinary indeed that the editor had
seen fit to append a few words of his own
to it

  we have received the following announcement
with a request that it be inserted at our usual ad-
vertising rates much against our will we are there-
fore compelled to insert it at the same time reserving
the liberty of cautioning mr teague against taking
the steps he indicates we would advise mr teague
against trying to reform the world but most strongly
do we advise him not to attempt reforming spain
much as we admire the spirit that moves him

  this was followed by

an open letter to senor rodrigo robles

       my very courageous sir

   the undersigned was a spectator of the bull-fight
at linea yesterday his first bull-fight while fully
capable of admiring the better and more manly
aspects of this sport permit me to say that i
consider the inclusion of broken-down decrepit
cab-horses in the ring placed there for the obvious
and only purpose of being gutted to a painful
death does not accord with the finer side of the
play and certainly not with spanish chivalry as
i have been led to understand it on this mon-
day september th being in my right mind and
positively declining any reward or emolument i
challenge you to let me kill the last bull in the corrida
advertised for next sunday september nd per-
mitting me to act as one of your capcadors for the
killing of the first five bulls in order to gather a
little necessary experience as it were but with
one condition there must be no horses for this last
bull if i am to kill it my desire being to demonstrate
that the inclusion of the horses is as unnecessary as
it is cruel

yours very admiringly

wilberforce teague

co the exiles mess

  south barrack road gibraltar

  teague was ragged unmercifully by his
colleagues when they saw this but he
merely turned his smiling pink-and-white
baby face to all their chatfing on tuesday
the bullfight



the spanish language newspapers of gib-
raltar as well as the papers of linea and
algeciras appeared with a spanish trans-
lation of teagues challenge

  on wednesday the announcement was
copied in the madrid dailies and on thurs-
day every newspaper in spain held the in-
sulting challenge of the inglesevery rag
from cadiz to barcelona and from malaga
to vigo caricatures accompanied teagues
defiance in the madrid papers caricatures
of an alleged typical englishman a
lanky man with drooping mustaches and
flowing side-whiskers a top hat and a
monocle depicted in the act of subbing a
bull in the hind quarters with a phenome-
nally long sword

  teague was on the noon to  p m
duty every morning at six a m he donned
his football shorts and took a run along the
south road to its end in the cliffs before the
governors cottage then back again
past the lighthouse at europa point and
down the long slope of the europa main
road into the alameda then back along
the line wall and up the grueling grade of
scud hill up and ever up literally climbing
a steep hill at a slow jog trot up the long
flight of stone steps slowly one at a time
in order not to strain his interior anatomy
and so back to a cold bath at the quarters
and a rub-down with embrocation by the
faitliful walker

  after duty in the evening he repaired to
the slaughter house on the north front
there some experts in the art of slaughter-
ing cattle obligingly demonstrated to him
the exact spot behind a bulls left horn where
the matador places the point of his blade for
the kill through the heart also the proper
angle of thrusting on thursday after-
noon mr hyatt the superintendent sent
for teague

  whats all this i hear mr teague
said he in the cold distant voice that his
men knew and dreaded remember the
company expects its employees to behave
like gentlemen now dont let me hear
any more about this bull-fighting rot

  teagues heart sang with glee as he
emerged from the presence he had feared
the extraction of a promise but instead had
not been required to say a single word
that same night teague received a visitor
none less than rodrigo robles himself
robles was all smiles

  splendid exclaimed he my own

press-agent could have done no better we
shall fill the ring to overflowing of a sure-
ty you shall kill the last bull without
horses you say why certainly mr
teague and you are sure you know just
how to kill a bull

it is not necessary to dilate
upon the further conversation
of wilberforce teague and rod-
rigo robles suffice to say that
newly printed posters on friday told the
world that mr wilberforce teague an
esteemed member of the british community
of gibraltar overcome by the well-known
sporting instincts of his race and positively
without pay or reward of any kind would
act as a capeador in the cuadrilla of the re-
nowned rodrigo robles and would kill the
last bull with his own hands

  sunday came with it came excursion
trains from bobadilla into algeciras so
by the small steamers across the bay to
gibraltar and from thence to linea by cab
came the crowd excited mobs from se-
ville from granada from malaga and even
from far-off madrid all the country vil-
lages of southern andalusia sent contingents

  tommy atkins arrived in companies and
half regiments decked out in red parade
uniforms and white pith helmets jack
tars and soldiers made long thin lines of
red and blue against the sunday-suit browns
and blacks of an unprecedented audience of
spaniards

  the ring which holds easily thirty thou-
sand people was filled to overflowing a
panic-stricken superintendent heard at the
last moment that the under-the-legal-age
teague was bent on carrying through hrs
challenge the superintendent was morally
responsible for teague both to the com-
pany and to that young mans parents
but it was too late

  teague had gone early to linea and was
even then decked out in the borrowed trap-
pings of a capeador only a shade less mag-
nificent than the great robles himself the
faithful walker was allowed to attend him
which gave that gentleman the privilege of
a place on the barrier and the right of entry
into the arena at such times as teague
should need him

  the band blared and the crowd yelled it-
self hoarse as the brilliant band of matadors
marched into the ring but there was an
undercurrent of keen enmity toward the


adventure

foreigner who sought to bring the national
sport of spain into disrepute

  teague took the first bull as it entered
at a rush he held his red cape out over
his right arm low to the ground the bull
charged and the cape was removed to uie
opposite point of the compass as teague
wheeled lightly about on his toes wheeled
but never moved from the place of his
stance

  the bull turned and this time he came at
the legs the wheeling silk-stockinged legs
had caught his eye as the downward
charging head seemed about to sweep those
legs from under the man the legs disap-
peared they hopped most unaccountably
over the left horn of the animal to a posi-
tion so close to the charging mass that
teague was able to slap the huge body re-
soundingly as it flew past him the con-
cussion of the rushing air nearly blew
teague over

  a roar of approval from the immense
throng even the most experienced cape-
adors do not stay so close to the bull for
two consecutive charges robles beamed
his pleasure por todos los santos but he
would engage this cool-headed ingles as a
capeador on the strength of that play alone

  the bull felt the slap and turned in his
stride he evidently wished to see who had
inflicted the insult of a slap on an insuper-
able bull of the marques de larios

  he wheeled and came at teague at short
range the third charge in less than ten sec-
onds this sort of following-up of charge
after charge has been known to rattle even
the best matadors that is why there are
usually about six of those gentlemen the
idea being that they shall take it in turn to
play the bull giving each man time to col-
lect himself before his turn comes round
again

  this time the bull came with a plunge
ihat almost unnerved teague almost but
not quite for the bull came at the cape
the cape was removed and the animal flew
by so close to the man who had not even
troubled to move his legs that he could smell
the beasts breath coming hot off the sand

  another capeador took the next charge
and robles and his men came up to tender
congratulations but teague had an ob-
ject in taking more than his fair share of the
capeador play

  he wished to take no part in the killing
of the horses and therefore would take more

than his part in the other play so that no-
body should be able to accuse him of shirk-
ing or cowardice

  the first bull was killed in twenty min-
utes the second and third took about
half-an-hour each whenever the capeadors
started to play the bull toward the horses
teague left them on these occasions he
took up a position of solitary state near the
barrier conversing with walker

  all sorts of remarks were flung at teague
out of the seething sea of faces above him

  hark at em he said once to walker
do you know what they are saying
walker knew but shook his head he
knew more spanish than teague but he
feigned ignorance

  well said teague i know what
theyre saying theyre saying i am a
sissy for not wanting to see the horses
killed

  he smiled they called him worse names
still for there are finer grades of sarcastic
imprecation in the spanish than in any
other language under the sun words
frankly that have no equivalent of transla-
tion even in the filthiest english teagues
testing that afternoon was a mental test
every bit as hard as the physical one

  came bull number four twenty-five
minutes for him then bull number five
and so to the last bull it is ever the un-
expected that happens while the mule
team made its long curves in the sand where
the mules dragged out the dead bull and
horses a tremendous shouting broke out
from a certain section of the audience

  don tancredol they cried suerte de
don tancredol

  the shouts were taken up by other sec-
tions of the crowd and soon the whole ring
rang with don tancredol moreover it
seemed they desired el ingles to perform the
feat

  robles ran over to where teague and
walker chatted by the barrier he spoke
a few hurried words to walker who inter-
preted to teague teague understood
he informed robles that he was ready for
the don tancredo act or anything else the
audience demanded

  many many years ago in spain lived a
middle-aged gentleman named don tan-
credo this gentleman was not a patron
of the bull-ring indeed it is said that bull-
fights bored him and one day having
heard his friends extolling a certain great
the bullfight

 

matador of those times to the skies don
tancredo rudely interrupted the talk to in-
form those friends that though lacking the
wind to chase bulls around arenas on hot
sunday afternoons and though getting on
in years nevertheless he tancredo would
face any bull alone and unarmed in the cen-
ter of the ring and would continue facing
that bull until the bull grew tired of looking
at him or alternatively until it killed him

  tancredos challenge was accepted he
bravely took up his station alone and un-
armed in the center of the ring where he
stood on a small pedestal no higher than a
footstool

  the bull after entering the ring charged
straight up to the daring man but tancredo
stood as still as any statue and the animal
after sniffing at his legs walked disdainfully
away don tancredo escaped with his life
and in bu -fights ever since that time the
stierle de don tancredo the luck of don
tancredo has been reenacted hundreds of
times

the assistants raked the
sand into an even surface and the
ring was cleared a capeador
placed a low footstool in the exact
center of the vast space a circle that seemed
unaccountably large to teague now that the
last man had left the ring a bugle blew
the gate opened for the sixth time that after-
noon and the last bull came blindly forward
into the sunlight

  he was a tremendous animal a king
among the bulls his horns stood out a
full foot on each side of his shaggy head and
then curved wickedly up to the skies for
another eighteen inches ending in two ra-
pier points

  a most unusual bull for he kept his head
high instead of smelling at the ground as
most bulls do when entering the ring a
whisper went through the files of the audi-
ence a whisper that shivered nervously
along the sea of faces

  men grew gloomy and women counted
their beads for the spaniard with all his
faults does not like to have his afternoons
entertainment capped with the killing of a
brave man the whispering resolved into
a murmur of words

  wot are they syeing queried a tommy
just out from aldershot of the artilleryman
at his left the artilleryman had been at
gib many years theyre sayin hes a

bad bull sonny a herd leader thats
why he keeps his head up theyre sayin
hes a bull what looks when he charges

  the tommy ruminated on this informa-
tion for a space then

  its a -shime returned he hotly

thats wot i sye a - shime they

done it a purpose the low-down murderin
blayguards they kep that bull back a
purpose ter murder this feller from the telly-
grafs id like ter start a murderin some on
em now

  stow that talk brown came the order
from a sergeant the tommy was the pos-
sessor of a stentorian voice he was also
the possessor of an empty bottle which he
held in his right hand punctuating the in-
dignation that consumed him by waving it
about in the air

   ere mate go slow with that bottle
protested the soldier on the right of the
bottle waver as he spoke the bull charged
straight at don tancredo teague teague
tried to close his eyes but found that he
could not a fearful fascination had kept
his eyes glued to the brown mass of the bull
from the moment in had entered the ring
for he stood facing the point of its entry

  blinded by the sudden glare the animal
had walked aimlessly about near the barrier
for the interminable space of nearly one
minute during that appalling minute
teague had made one definite decision he
knew the bull must make its charge sooner
or later and he had decided that whatever
happened he would stay standing where he
was

  in order that there should be no doubt
about accomplishing this he had resolved to

close his eyes he might die but they
should never be able to say that he had
moved a wonderful calm swept over him
at this glorious thought the honor of eng-
land of the whole race was in his hands
and dash it all-it was safe teague was
a singularly clean-living clean-speaking
boy he had never cursed in all his young
life a feeling of ineffable abandonment
overcame him and then when he saw the
beginning of that charge the bulls glaring
eyes directed straight at him followed by
the flicker of the tail the playful almost
skittish way it pranced about on its short
incredibly active legs as it took note of its
objective and finally the lowered head as
the huge mass came straight at him-his
eyes refused to close
 e

adventure

    in that moment a tommy with a voice
  like a drum arose from the place where he
  sat at a right angle to the direction of the
  charging bull he threw an empty wine
  bottle with all his force at the bull and he
  threw a terrible shout of defiance after the
  bottle a general defy to all bulls bullrings
  spaniards and spain

     the bottle fell short but rolled it at-
  tracted the bulls eye and the voice attract-
   ed his ears so that he wheeled within six
  feet of tancredo teague to investigate this
  other presence in the ring the bull sniffed
  at the bottle and then cantered up to the
  barrier whence that blast of a voice had
  come bull raised an inquiring head to the
  red-coated men above him the tommy
  stood up and harangued the bull comedy
  again entered into the audience

    strictly speaking the tommy should have
  been arrested and bundled ignominiously
  back to gibraltar but nobody seemed to no-
  tice the discrepancy

     ef yer touch a air of is ead bellowed
  the tommy to the bull ill come dahn
  there and pluck the dirty eart aht of yer

    the spaniards did not understand but
  were quick to see the humor of the situation
  in fact they roared with laughter one
  would have thought they understood every
  single word as indeed they did gather the
  meaning

    yuss ill come an jolt yer with me
  bagginet yer dirty dog

    he produced tie bayonet and drew the
  short blade glaring about him to see if any
  spaniard in all that crowd would be willing
  to gainsay him but the crowd was con-
  sumed with waves of mirth

    sit down and shut up there brown
  came the cold voice of the sergeant

    private brown sat down but he had ac-
  complished more than his wine-fuddled
  senses knew the bull turned his head
  along the line of the red-coats had any-
  body there anything more to say no he
  wheeled suddenly flicked his short tail con-
  temptuously in tie face of the british army
  and cantered lightly back to don tancredo
  if you have not seen seven or eight hundred
  pounds of bone and brawn canter lightly
  then you have not seen the andalusian bull
  in action

     the bull drew up before teague advanced
  two paces and sniffed carefully at his stock-
  inged legs then he walked around those
  legs legs as still as stone and sniffed at the

backs of the calves this was the supreme
test of nerve to see what sniffs before
you is bad enough but to feel that sniff be-
hind you when you can not see when you
must not move a limb-that is the very cul-
mination of the limit for a bull is just as
likely to charge from the back as from the
front and though teague could not see a
breathless audience saw the bull walk slowly
away

  arose a tremendous shout bastal
enough robles decided that it was
enough and gave a sign his men sprang
over the barrier don tancredos luck
was in a capeador had to pinch teague
in the legs in order to induce movement in
those limbs

and the baiting of the last bull

began without horses as per
agreement it was a great fight
the bull was remarkably strong
he refused to stop chasing the capeadors
in one brief moment of bovine glory he had
everybody in the ring including the re-
nowned robles over the barrier or squeezed
in the little refuges around the ring the little
wooden refuges built against the barrier
where a thin man may squeeze himself but
where the bull can not enter

  teague approached robles as his fellow
capeadors made miraculous jumpings and
escapes from the now infuriated bull in an-
other part of the arena

  banderillas said teague pointing to
himself

  the capeadors were getting very tired
playing the restive bull all the time without
the diversion usually provided by the horses
and teague desired to take the bull himself
for a few minutes to help them out

  mind warned robles this one has
wide horns

  it appeared that every bull had some pe-
culiarity this one had wide horns very
well teague would watch them he played
the bull with his cape for seven consecutive
charges the animal was plunging too much
for the banderiua play the bull must be
brought to a temporary standstill before the
placing of the darts can be attempted

  the audience applauded tremendously
at the spectacle of one man taking the bull
for such a prolonged period such a thing
was unknown in the etiquette of the ring
but the tired capeadors needed a rest and
were not worrying about etiquette just then
the bullfight



teague was getting his second wind the
long running exercise of the previous week
now began to tell his legs felt most aston-
ishingly lithe and strong beneath him

  the audience went crazy this was real
sport-one man wearing a strong bull down
by his own unaided efforts

  and that was precisely the idea teague
wished to convey-that horses were unnec-
essary and that the men should wear the
bull down by their own efforts the bull
was standing still now then he started
charging again a series of charges pullings-
up wheelings and charges again not once
did teague take the shelter of the barrier
although the crowd freely invited him to do
so he pretended to run for the barrier
turned in his stride and let the bull chase
him for half the circumference of the ring

  such a thing was unheard of in all the an-
nals of bull-fighting for almost any bull
can catch the fastest runner and here was
a running man giving the bull a chance to
do it but teague ran faster than the bull
and finally the animal gave it up he re-
fused to chase teague any longer teague
flung his cape to an assistant he took two
banderillas and drawing himself up to his
full height paced toward the panting bull

  he extended his arms above his head a
battderilla in each hand he walked to
within seven paces of the bull and stopped
the bull had had a slight rest and decided
that another charge wouldnt do him any
harm he charged it seemed the horns
were about to close on the motionless body
of the man when as in one movement
hands came sharply down legs hopped
lightly aside-and the bull went flying past
trying to shake off the two darts shivering
in the huge hump of his back

  the crowd yelled its approval of the per-
fect banderilla play robles second came
forward to place a pair of darts he suc-
ceeded in placing one the crowd groaned
capeadors came up to take the bull for a
space forty minutes had passed since the
bull came into the ring not counting six
minutes of the tancredo prologue robles
spoke to teague

  the people are clamoring for the death
of the bull said he

  i will kill him now give me the sword
replied teague

  be careful warned robles he will
charge when you least expect it in his pres-
ent state he is far from worn out

   

  but teague insisted

  give me the sword said he i will tire
him thoroughly myself and then kill him

  shrugging his shoulders robles walked
away the kill is the supreme test of the
master matador and as all the swords-
mans attention must of necessity be con-
centrated on the correct thrusting of his
sword there is always the second or two
when he must take his eyes off the bulls
forelegs it is only in the tensing of the fore-
legs that the imminence of a charge may be
detected teague had rested he now
took the play of the capeadors and played
the bull to a complete standstill

  throwing his cap on the ground as he had
seen robles do the previous sunday he
signaled for the sword raising the naked
blade high in the air he bowed stiffly to all
four quarters of the ring a better actor
than teague would have seized this mo-
ment for a little acting for a series of exag-
gerated facetious bowings to the crowd

  if not much of an actorteague was avery
brave young man for in order to bow to
the fourth side of the ring he turned his back
to the bull the whole essence of the bull-
fighters safety first is to keep his face to
the bull it takes nerve to turn the back on
the bull even for a second

  teague was standing a bare five yards
from the bull when he bowed to that fourth
point of the compass and he turned his back
on the awful curved horns for nearly ten sec-
onds the spaniard notes these things
spontaneously and a loud roar of applause
went up this disdain of the bull appeals
intensely to the crowd

  and even as the roar went up into the blue
sky so it ended as suddenly in a babel of
excited shoutings and cries of warning for
the bull had chosen this moment to charge
his angry eyes looking straight before him
had caught the inviting aspect of something
definite to vent his fury on the fury that
had kept him chasing flying feet and red
capes for the best part of forty minutes

  and he saw a gaudy pair of matadors
pants as their owner bowed stiffly to the op-
posite side of the ring a nice cushion-like
object to charge at something definite to
hit after all this chasing of disappearing
objects

  teague felt a concussion as though he
had been struckby a speeding automobile
most unaccountably he found himself re-
volving rapidly up in the air he hit the


adventure

sand with a thud fortunately the bull had
charged for the purely bovine purpose of
tossing but robles had been watching
and as the bull wheeled to sniff at the dis-
comfited teague the matador laid on its
tail with all his power capcadws rushed
up to assist him in this tug-of-war

  the bull turned savagely on this new inter-
ruption teague got up slowly picking up
his sword and cape from the sand he
stretched his limbs and rubbed himself at
the point of contact with the bull and it
appeared that no bones were broken

  a roar of laughter swept the audience a
very friendly mirth interspersed with ribald
remarks pertaining to the human anatomy
from long lines of cheering tommies the
generous robles spoke to teague

  surely the senor felt unnerved after his
terrible experience he robles would kill
the bull teague insisted that he teague
would settle with the bull once more he
advanced on the animal the bull was now
thoroughly exhausted the noble head hung
down the slavering mouth almost touching
the sand there was no luster in the once
fierce eyes

  teaguefclt asurge of pity sweep over him
the herd leader had fought a brave fight
why not then let him go all he wanted
was to lay down in some dewy pasture and
rest in the morning he would be leading his
herd again as good a bull as ever

  a malar i kill him roared the crowd
teague knew that if he did not kill the bull
somebody else would very quickly do so
he felt no fear as he advanced to within a
yard of the lowered head no fear only
aversion then by all that was just and
fair he would kill this brave beast properly
there should be no further prolongation of
the agony no missing of the mark no false
thrust through the lungs and the aston-
ished audience saw the slight figure of the
man with the sword walk up to the very
nostrils of the bull robles swore an oath
of admiration beneath his breath carayl
-but this was a man teague placed the
point of the sword over the correct spot

  he stood high on his toes over his victim
and with a prayer in his heart that the thrust
might be straight and true and with his
whole attention on the correct angle of the
kill forty degrees from over the left horn
to the heart he thrust with all his might
the bull started forward as the blade passed
through its mighty heart shivered and

  lurched and teague who had not moved
placed his left hand almost caressingly on
the top of the shaggy head

  its all right old chap thats the last
of all your troubles he found himself
muttering

  he felt more bitter against the whole busi-
ness of bull-fighting in that moment than he
had ever felt before he drew the sword
from the shuddering body and walked slow-
ly away when he looked back the bull
was stiff on its side

  thank god he breathed robles and
his men ran up to offer congratulations but
teague was only able to offer a limp unre-
sponsive hand to their warm handclasps
the crowd was in a frenzy such a kill had
never been seen before

  the best matadors usually effect their
kills under a tremendous strain of tense re-
pressed excitement but here was a man who
placed himself between the very horns of the
bull and languidly fondled the animal as he
slew it teague was only able to return a
diffident bow to the hoarse clamorings of the
audience and he and walker made a quick
retreat to the dressing-room of the capeadors

a thoroughly flabbergasted
superintendent had mr wilber-
force teague on the mat early the
following morning

  there is a man due for furlough in aden
said the superintendent and i have de-
cided to send you to relieve him you will
sail on tomorrows p  o boat that is all
mr teague

  suez aden mombasa zanzibar dur-
ban-it was all the same to teague any
of the companys stations was good enough
for him anything to escape the memory of
that hectic sunday afternoon in linea

  but if you ever go to linea-and watch
your wallet when you go it is a rough town-
and put the question you will find a score of
men ready to enlighten you on the way
teague fought the bulls that sunday after-
noon especially the last bull with many
exaggerations and a lot of local color thrown
in after the spanish fashion

  it is a pity teague failed to reform bull-
fighting they still use horses in the ring
but it is a dying sport the latest reports
from spain would indicate that association
football is rapidly displacing the plaza de
toros and the corrida as a popular holiday
diversion

  -------it was two oclock in the after-
noon the intermediate passenger
liner penguin now in her new
- york dock was to sail for cristo-
bal via port-au-prince at three captain
john mcguire a lean lithe tanned little
man stood on the saloon deck for years
captain mac as he was called had been
master of the hawk of the same line but
the worn old freighter being laid up for re-
pairs he had volunteered to relieve the pen-
guins commander who had requested six
months leave of absence the little captain
was leaning upon the rail casually watching
longshoreman transfer three small kegs from
the pier to the ship

  an armored motor-truck had backed up
to the skids that bridge the gap between the
pier and a large square port in the ships
side armed and watchful men stood on
the pier by the skids and other armed
men were stationed on the ships main deck
at several points between the skids and the
strong-room a longshoreman had come
up with a hand-truck the first keg was tilted
upon the truck and the man propelled it
down the skids to the ships main deck port
passageway along this fore-and-aft passage-
way to another that ran athwartship where
the longshoreman paused and peered closely
at the deck ahead

  how bout that bunker plate ahead
there he asked is it on tight

  one of the armed guards tested the brass
coal-bunker plate in the deck with his foot

  all right buddy come on he said

  the truck went ahead clanged over the

  bunker plate and halted before the specie-
locker here stood sam heidleman the
ships purser he copied into a note-book
the markings on the keg then waved the
longshoreman to trundle it into the locker
which was a small iron-walled room with a
massive iron door the keg was tilted
from the truck and the longshoreman went
back to the pier for another the second
and third kegs were likewise brought aboard
the penguin checked and placed in the
strong-room the purser closed the iron
door placed a hinged iron bar or hasp
across it and secured the bar with a pad-
lock then he signed a receipt and gave it to
the guard who had been responsible for the
kegs till their delivery aboard ship

  thats that a pleasant voyage to you
purser said the guard and made his way
ashore

  purser heidleman climbed a ladder to the
saloon deck where he found the captain still
leaning upon the rail

  species aboard capn said the purser

  captain mac nodded

  a passenger was leaning on the rail some
ten feet aft of the captain the passenger
was a big black-browed man with sharp
stabbing black eyes and a harsh mouth he
had been watching the loading of the three
kegs now he straightened turned slowly
stared boldly at captain mac then at the
purser

  find your quarters satisfactory mr
taber inquired the purser pleasantly

  the black-browed man grunted some-
thing that sounded like hr-rumph swung




adventure

slowly on his heel and marched off down the
deck

  who is that feliowasked the captain
looking after the man

  name on the passenger-list is taber-
nelson taber thats all i know about him
sir except that hes a through passenger to
cristobal he reminds me of a bulldog
hes got that air agreed the captain
he seems the kind of man who would hang
on to a thing once he clamped his teeth on
it

  thats the way he strikes me too
about the specie-what have we this
time

   gold coin sir three kegs of it three-
quarters of a million dollars oro americana
in all

  panamanian gold balboas i suppose
yes sir from the philadelphia mint
well have your assistant stand by the
locker till we leave the pier

   hes there sir

  thats right tell the second mate to
make an entry in the logbook -specie
aboard 

   ill tell him sir

  the purser went forward and captain
mac went down the passenger gangway to
the pier there he met mr barnes the
chief engineer

  never knew it to fail complained the
chief never why is it that coal-heav-
ers have to get drunk on sailing day why
do they have to pick that particular day
here it is within an hour of sailing and im
three men shy

    thats the way it happens said
captain mac read this i got it half an
hour ago

   the chief took the telegram that the cap-
tain handed him it read

   can not sail in penguin am sending substitute
mate hope he will do put my clothes on pier
please	williams

  thats from the man who was chief mate
in this ship cxclaimed captain mac he
went ashore this morning to say good-by to
his people he hadnt signed on when he
left i suppose he found a better job
did you take the mate he sent you in
his place

   yes there was no reason why i shouldnt
take him he looks like a good man
shattucks his name

  shattuck hmm dont think i know

im well i have to scout around for some
coal-heavers capn

  grumbling and shaking his head the
chief went toward the street

  in a few minutes he returned grinning
and after him trailed three tough looking
men carrying straw-covered suit cases and
canvas sea-bags

  i was lucky he shouted to captain
mac i picked up three pierhead jump-
ers right outside the pier and to his men
come on boys get aboard and sign on
youll find the commissioner wailing for you
in the messroom

  he herded them up the crews- gangway
and into the ship

the big pier was crowded with
longshoremen porters baggage
men passengers and friends of
passengers trunks were being
carried aboard over the after skids and low-
ered into the hold hand baggage was being
carried up the passenger gangway by sweat-
ing porters the rails on this side of the
ship were lined with excited people and
there was a press about the upper end of the
gangway

  captain mac on the pier looked at his
watch then he made a motion to the third
mate who was watching him from the wing
of the ships bridge the third mate dis-
appeared and a moment later the passen-
gers were startled by the roar of the warning
whistle three times the whistle sounded
and as the last blast died a white-coated
porter began to go the rounds of the decks
crying all ashore thats goin ashore
friends ashore please the pilot was on
the bridge and a man with a white and a red
flag was standing on the end of the pier a
single fall had been made fast to the upper
end of the gangway and longshoremen
stood on the pier in readiness to haul the
gangway away from the ship when the word
should be given the crews gangway had
been put upon the pier and longshoremen
were unrigging the cargo skids and nets

  a taxicab suddenly rolled out upon the
pier with a great honking of its horn it
had not yet come to a full stop when its door
flew open and out popped a plump blond
red-cheeked little man whose clothes were
all awry and whose soft velour hat was
crumpled down over one ear

  hy wait a minute he cried excitedly
here i am wait a minute
three kegs of specie



  several porters ran to the plump mans
assistance they took a trunk from the
running board of the taxi and two suitcases
from within and started aboard with them
the little man paid the taxi driver showed
his tickets to the assistant passenger agent
on the pier and followed his baggage up
the gangway

  whew he puffed smiling to the pas-
sengers grouped on the gangway almost
missed it gosh that would never do i
been waitin twenty years for this trip
captain mac came aboard made his way
to the bridge and nodded all right to the
pilot the gangway was lowered to the
pier the third mate at a word from the
ilot put the engine-room telegraph on
alf speed astern a bell jangled far be-
low and a moment later the twin propellers
threshed the water the vessel began to
gather stern-way and the whistle shrieked
its coming-out-of-slip warning the pen-
guin backed out into the busy east river
was swung and pointed and began to work
its way down-stream through the traffic

   look there capn said the pilot point-
ing forward over the canvas weather-cloth

   in the ships bows leaning so far over the
rail that it seemed a miracle he did not lose
his balance was the plump little man who
had nearly missed the sailing he was in-
terestedly watching the vessels stem slicing
the dirty river water nearby stood mr
shattuck the chief officer at his station by
the anchors till the ship should pass beyond
the narrows he seemed to be talking to
the plump passenger perhaps he was cau-
tioning him not to lean too far over the rail
the pilot chuckled

  recognize the type capn mac a
little two-by-four business man taking a va-
cation-or maybe hes just retired first
time hes ever been away from home hes
probably shipped the wife and kids off to
stay with some relative this is to be his
one big adventure ill bet you a box of
good cigars that ive sized him up to a t
how about it settle the bet when you
return from this voyage

  you ought to give odds protested
captain mac i might just as well hand
you the cigars and have it over with but
ill call it a bet just to show im a sport
capn parks

  thats the stuff if there were more
sports like you capn mac id never have
to buy any smokes

at eight bells that night the
chief mate made his nightly re-
port to cyptain mac on the
bridge

  alls well about the decks sir

  the captain nodded

  i found a passenger a big sour looking
guy-taber i think his name is-hanging
around the main deck by the specie-locker
added mr shattuck i told him no pas-
sengers were allowed on that deck

 what did he say

 he said hr-rumph and turned his
back on me and went above hes a
grouchy bird that one

 he seems to be agreed the captain
ive noticed him

 the mate said good night and went to-
ward his room

  captain mac stepped to the bridge rail
restedjhis arms and chin upon the upper edge
of the weather-cloth and gazed down upon
the deck below the promenade deck there
was no moon and the deck was dark and
shadowy lighted dimly here and there by
the standing deck-lights the air was cool
few passengers were about the decks
though now and then a couple arm in arm
passed under the bridge and around the
wheelhouse stamping in the manner of
landsmen aboard ship in the social hall a
waiters orchestra was making a sort of
music

  two men had halted by a deck-light just
abaft the bridge they had their heads to-
gether and were talking earnestly and in low
voices the third mate whose watch it
was came up beside the captain put his
head over the dodger and looked down at
the two men he snickered contemptu-
ously

  you know those two dont you capn
he said

 the captain looked hard at the two men
for some seconds

  i think ive seen them about the pier
he said at last theyre company detec-
tives arent they

 they think theyre detectives that
chunky one is kelly the head detective
he thinks hes the real thing because he
wears a derby hat and pancake shoes and
because he catches a longshoreman stealing
a couple  pair o socks or a can o sardines
out of the cargo the other one donohue
is worse than kelly hes a detective part
of the time and cargo-checker the rest


adventure

  well i guess they do their best

  oh yes i guess they do their best
capn and theyre harmless they mean
well theyre aboard here because of that
shipment of gold specie theyve been
telling the other passengers that theyre
wealthy mining men going to look over their
mines in colombia dont they look the
part

  captain mac smiled

  a man came along the promenade deck
from aft and as he came within range of a
deck-light captain mac saw that it was
taber the surly passenger taber brushed
by the two company detectives and was
about to pass on when kelly the chunky
one reached out and clutched him by the
arm

  say taber i wanta talk to you-
began kelly

  taber turned slowly his gaze fastened
upon the hand that held his coat sleeve
kelly released his grip and stepped back
tabers eyes glittered in the faint light and
his swarthy face slowly twisted into a mask
of fury

  listen you he snarled stay away
from me you and your partner dont
come near me dont look at me dont
think of me if you speak to me again ill
chuck the pair of you over the side i know
what im after and im going to get it i
always get what i go after get wise to
yourself while your health is good do you
understand

  he reached out clutched kelly and dono-
hue by their coats and dragged them to
him

  but i know somethin- began kelly
trying vainly to release himself

  keep it to yourself youre two brain-
less fools and if you dont keep your tongues
between your teeth somebodys going to
cut your ears off you dont know what
youre up against this time they gave
you a job thats too big for you if youll
take my advice youll make a nice little
pleasure trip out of this and get back to
your job of pinching bohunk longshoremen
as quick as you can whatever you do
dont interfere with me if you get in my
way or attempt to block my plans so help
me ill break you in pieces

  he shoved the two detectives from him
and marched off

  aw go to- growled kelly when

the big man was beyond hearing

taber halted by the rail just
forward of the bridge he stood
with his hands behind his back
his soft black hat pulled low over
his eyes looking out over the inky water

  tough egg whoever he is commented
the third mate to captain mac he sure
took the wind out of kelly and donohue
wonder what he meant by all that

  i dont know what he meant answered
captain mac but what he said is worth
making a mental note of

  around the front of the wheelhouse came
the plump blond man who had nearly
missed the ship his hands in his pockets
and a big cigar in his mouth he halted be-
side taber and looked up at him

  ive been all over the boat and i think
ive made myself known to everybody but
you i believe in being friends with every-
body dont you

  hr-rumph answered taber folding his
arms across bis chest and turning half-away
from the talkative one

  of course i have a card here but you
couldnt read it in the dark my name is
dumphries george w if you ever lived
in brooklyn youve seen my ad-brook-
lyns best butcher thats me ive
been a butcher for twenty-five years i
started with a string of frankfurters and
now ive got a string of stores ha-ha
dumphries every word carried to cap-
tain mac and young mr carlsen the third
mate indeed so high-pitched and carry-
ing was the cheerful butchers voice they
could not have shut their ears to it had they
tried

  you lose capn or rather the pilot
wins youll have to look him up and give
him a box of cigars when we get back to
new york now watch taber squelch
brooklyns best butcher said carlsen

  but taber did not try to squelch the
butcher instead he suddenly seized the
others hand and shook it heartily he ac-
cepted a cigar and a light and teetered
contentedly on his heels while george w
dumphries rambled on with his cheerful
monologue

  i always promised myself this trip i
retired a month ago and last week i sent
the old lady and the children to her sisters
in pennsylvania i want to see a bit of life
while im still-well middle-aged i want
to taste that barbancourt rum they make in
haiti and drink some absinthe in panama
three kegs of specie

and maybe ill kind o look the girls over
in colon-im not so old eh

  he nudged taber with his elbow and the
surly man surprized the watchers above by
throwing back his head and loosing a laugh
it was a peculiar laugh and an unpleasant
one it started slowly and low with a sort
of rasping grunt gathered volume till it
became a roar a hollow mirthless roar then
ended abruptly it was the kind of laugh
a lion might give as it gathered itself to leap
upon its fear-stricken prey

  but there was no trace of fear in the
merry lilt of plump little dumphries laugh
it rippled on long after tabers fearsome
roar had been carried off by the breeze

  lets go to the smoking room and see if
we cant start a little game suggested
dumphries small stakes just enough to
make it interesting or if you feel reckless
well make it something worthwhile say
fifty-cent limit and he added as if at
an after-thought the old ladyd give me
the very dickens if she knew

  arm in arm they went off the big snarly
man and the cheerful little one

at midnight captain mac

went to his room closed the door
and was preparing to turn in
when there came a sharp knock
and an excited voice cried

  hey capn open up

  come in answered captain mac

  the door flew open and donohue the
taller of the two detectives put in his head
he was plainly in a mental flurry and was
with difficulty maintaining a semblance of
professional calm

  come quick capn were going to
make a pinch oh i forgot-maybe you
dont know who i am me and kelly are
company detectives the company sent
us aboard to look out that nobody got away
with that gold specie kellys got an eye on
a suspect already hes a slick one kelly is
he knows this guy were gonna pinch im
merely on suspicion inquired the cap-
tain you cant do that i wont allow
it we have to be careful or the company
would be swamped by lawsuits

  oh dont you worry about this capn
we aint takin no chances kellys got the
goods on this guy i dont know all lies
got-kelly aint the kind o fellow to tell
his business to everybody-but you can
bet hes got enough dope to make a pinch

besides we gotta take the bull by the horns
aint no sense in waitin till this guy gets
away with all that specie

  i dont think we need worry about that
he isnt likely to break down the door of
die specie-locker steal over a ton of gold
and hide it in a secret compartment of his
suitcase how many times have you heard
of a ship being robbed of its specie
captain mac put on his uniform coat and
cap and prepared to follow donohue

  we-ell i guess i aint never heard of it
at all admitted the detective but this
guys one of these here super-criminals
kelly was tellin me about him

  who is the man

  kelly give me orders not to say he
dont want it to get around yet you see
we was sittin in our room a while ago
kelly and me and the room-steward comes
to the door and asks us did we want any-
thing kelly made up his mind just like
that-snap-and told the steward to go get
this guy and tell him we wanted to see him
on important business and then he sends
me to get you to make it legal you see
kelly figures that well get this guy in the
room between us and force a confession out
of im third degree stuff dyou get the
idea

  i think youre way off your course an-
swered the captain following donohue from
the room

  just the same if you give us permis-
sion capn well either get a confession or
knock this guys block off

  captain mac as they stepped out upon
the unlighled bridge deck collided with
some one in the darkness and a gruff voice
said

  whats up capn i heard the loud
talking and thought maybe you were having
trouble with one of the sailors

  oh its you is it mr shattuck -
began captain mac but donohue full of
enthusiasm and excitement cut in
suspected criminal aboard mate were
gonna make a pinch

  oh said the chief mate an uncertain
note in his voice er-perhaps i had bel-
ter go along with you

  the three descended to the promenade
deck walked aft rounded the smoking
room and were about to start down to the
saloon deck when the captain happening
to glance into the smoking room through
an open window paused


adventure

  there was a card game still in progress at
a table in one corner facing captain mac
were taber and the little retired butcher
three other men were facing in the other
direction dumphries was grumbling and
fretting about his cards but taber who
had before him several high stacks of chips
seemed to be in what was for him a good
humor for on his swarthy face was an ex-
pression that approached near to a smile

  such luck came dumphries high-
pitched voice i havent had a decent
hand in the four hours ive been sitting
here

  taber glanced up his gaze traveled out
the window and came to rest upon the party
standing in the glow from the smoking
room he sat up straight and the near-
smile left his face as he looked from cap-
tain mac to shattuck then to donohue

  i have to go below he said rising
suddenly count my chips and give me
the money later im in a hurry just
thought of something

  donohue a puzzled look on his face was
rubbing one cheek thoughtfully

  well lets go below to kelly he said
but he didnt seem in the hurry he had been
in before seeing the party in the smoking
room

  they descended to the deck below and en-
tered the saloon-deck passenger quarters

  the stateroom occupied by kelly and
donohue no  on the starboard side of
the ship was called an outside room be-
cause its window looked out upon the open
deck but its door opened upon an inside
corridor that ran lengthwise along the ves-
sel as the party entered the corridor from
one end they saw two men coming along
beneath the dim night-lights from the
other end and as the two came near they
proved to be taber and dumphries who
had evidently gone forward and come below
through the social hall and dining saloon
the five men came together just outside
no  taber with not the slightest
hesitation halted and openly watched
donohue as he tried the door

  huh the doors locked muttered
the detective

  he rapped on the door with his knuckles

  no answer

  thats funny said donohue knocking
again this time louder then he called
hey kelly open up its me dono-
hue

  he must be asleep said shattuck
when again there was no answer

  the lights lit remarked captain mac
pointing to the glare that came through the
scroll-work high up in the partition

donohue stepped back to
look at the light and as he
did so he saw for the first time
that taber and dumphries had
stopped and were watching him he
seemed bewildered and embarrassed and
his mouth hung open with doubt

  i dont get this he muttered shaking
his head

  you dont get what asked captain
mac

  i dont understand-well somethin got
twisted thats all

  he thumped on the door with his fist but
there came no answer

  taber stepped forward brushed donohue
aside bent and looked through the keyhole

  something is wrong capn he growled
to captain mac

  mister shattuck said the captain
find the saloon watchman and get his
pass-key

  the mate left and in a few minutes
returned with the key he unlocked the
door and threw it wide captain mac en-
tered first then came taber and the others
shattuck last

  careful warned the captain dont
step in that

  he indicated a dark pool on the floor
then pointed across the room to something
lying half on the floor and half in the lower
of the two bunks

 kelly gasped donohue hes-
hes-

  dead-of course cut in taber cant
you see the knife sticking out of his back
the foo-

  he broke off crossed the room and slipped
his hand under kellys body to feel if there
was heart action

  dead sure he growled straightening
up murdered hr-rumph

  kelly was in a kneeling position the lower
part of his body resting on the floor and the
upper part on the ljerth his fingers were
gripping the bed clothes as if he had
clutched them as he fell

  there was only one door to the room
the murderer must have locked the door
after him and taken the key with him as he

fled the shade was drawn over the win-
dow and when captain mac went to open
the window in order to air the room he saw
that it was secured with a catch that could
be opened only from within

  taber was looking down at the bone-
handled knife that protruded from beneath
the dead mans shoulder blade the big
man seemed puzzled and several times he
glanced questioningly at donohue

  all you have to do now capn he said
with a side glance at the lean little ship-
master is find out who killed him hr-
rumph

  captain mac pursed his lips thought-
fully and turned to donohue

  donohue who was this suspected crim-
inal that kelly sent for just before you
called me

 what what you sent for a-a
suspected criminal demanded taber
i knew- say who did you send thats
the thing who did you send

  he was a room-steward said the de-
tective im not sure which one i didnt
get a good look at him he knocked at the
door and kelly opened the door and spoke
to him im pretty sure it was the man
who takes care of this room though

  and who did you send him for asked
captain mac again

  donohue opened his mouth to speak but
closed it again and an anxious uncertain
look passed over his face directly before
him stood taber and the big man was
frowning at him so threateningly that the
detective faltered and mumbled unintelli-
gently

  its not who he sent for its who he
sent rumbled taber thats the thing
we want to know

  but i want to know the man that was
sent for insisted the captain

  i tell you-

  mr taber im in command of this
ship captain macs voice was like
chilled steel i will do my best to get to
the bottom of this thing and if you insist
on interfering ill have you confined in your
room i want to know the man whom
kelly suspected of being a criminal the
man that he sent for just before he was
murdered

  taber made no answer but his threaten-
ing gaze  never left donohue for a mo-
ment

  i-i dont know who it was faltered

the detective i-i think maybe kelly
made a mistake

  mistake is right agreed taber i
tell you the thing to do is find the man who
was sent on that errand

  he turned slowly and studied each of
them in turn his black eyes stabbing and
probing and his heavy brows knotted in a
thoughtful frown the retired butcher his
eyes wide with the horror and his mouth
hanging open was standing by the doorway
just inside the room by his side stood
shattuck the mate captain mac was in
the center of the room taber was stand-
ing on the far side of the body sprawled half
across the berth donohue was in the cor-
ner at shattucks right

  that knife now said taber we
might find somebody that knows who it
belonged to-

  there was a sharp click the electric
bulb overhead glowed red for a tiny fraction
of a second then went out the room be-
came pitch black there came the sound
of cautious feet moving across the floor

  from somewhere sounded a hoarse gasp
then a short high shriek of pain

the light clicked on and shat-
tuck the mate was seen to be
standing by the light switch with
his hand upon it otherwise the
five men were standing in exactly the same
places they had been when the light went
out

  that cry - the window exclaimed
dumphries

  with surprizing agility he leaped to the
window sill and clambered through cap-
tain mac sprang also to the window but did
not climb through instead he put out his
head and looked up and down the deck
donohue came and looked over his shoulder

  dumphries was bending over a man who
lay in the waterway by the rail about
fifteen feet from the window as dumph-
ries moved to one side they saw that the
man on deck was a white-coated steward

  stabbed in the throat called dumph-
ries over his shoulder hes not dead
though

  donohue climbed through the window and
dropped to the deck he looked fore and
aft then went to the rail and looked over-
side

  why-why its impossible he ex-
claimed where did the man go who did


adventure

the stabbing the nearest passageway is
fifty feet away we had our heads out that
window two seconds after he yelled the
man who did the stabbing didnt have time
to get to a passageway or to climb in
through one of those windows the waiter
is about fifteen feel from any window and
couldnt have been stabbed by somebody
reachin out its like a man bein stabbed
in the middle of a desert with nobody
around

  is the knife there asked captain
mac

  no answered dumphries

  the heads of passengers awakened by
that piercing shriek were being put out
windows along the side of the passenger
quarters and excited questions were flying
back and forth two sailors came running
from forward and the saloon watchman
came from the dining saloon

  donohue bent over the wounded man

  why its the man kelly sent-its the
room-steward he cried

  the two sailors picked up the wounded
steward and carried him off and the watch-
man went to rouse out the ships surgeon

  captain mac turned away from the win-
dow and faced taber who had not moved
the surly man was staring down at kellys
body with a dumbfounded look on his face

  what now asked captain mac and
then following the big mans gaze the
knife the bone-handled knife he cried
its gone

  sure it is growled taber thats
what im trying to figure out-where did
it go

  but you were standing right here-

  sure i was standing here looking
at it

  and you dont know where it went

  no i dont

  i think said the captain firmly ill
have to call a couple of men and have you
searched

  you neednt call any men search me
yourself no objection here-

  he held his arms shoulder high as cap-
tain mac ran his hands over his clothes
the knife was not on tabers person
shattuck helped captain mac search i he
room and donohue and dumphries came in
while they were doing it the detective
swore hotly when he heard about the disap-
pearance of the knife

  somebody grabbed it when the light

went out thats what he said how did
that light come to go out anyhow

  they all looked at shattuck

  i dont know who put it out said he
i switched it on

  we-ell its a queer case grumbled
donohue

  he bent his head and stared down at the
body of the man who had been his superior
and friend and when he faced them again
his eyes were hot with anger and his jaw
was square with sudden resolution there
was defiance in his voice when he spoke
and it seemed to be directed at taber in
particular

  ill tell you one thing though im
gonna get the man who killed old kelly-
or ill know the reason why

  the reason why may be a piece of cold
steel growled taber

  thats all right ill take that chance
maybe i aint the best detective in the
world but i aint a fool either you can
call me a cheese detective if you want but
nobody can call me a quitter i aint sayin
what i know but i gotta idea in my nut and
im gonna follow it up he patted his
hip pocket and the guy that tries to
work on me with a knife is liable to get his
front collar button blown through the back
of his neck you can pass the word around
to your friends taber

  captain mac started and glanced quickly
at taber what did donohue mean
was he implying that taber had something
to do with the murder of kelly that re-
mark should receive some earnest thought
decided the little shipmaster

  taber appeared entirely unconcerned
shattuck was studying the fire and collision
instructions framed and posted beside the
doorway the retired brooklyn butcher
was staring at the dead man with a morbid
curiosity and with the horror of one who
has always led a quiet peaceful law-abiding
life

  well gentlemen said the captain ill
hold a sort of inquest at ten oclock to-
morrow morning ill expect you all to be
there in the social hall

  they filed out captain mac shut and
fastened the window stepped outside and
shut and locked the door

  dumphries who had a stateroom all to
himself politely offered to share it with
donohue but the detective firmly shook his
head taber greatly to captain macs
three kegs of specie



surprise made a similar offer and the de-
tective after some thought accepted they
murmured subdued good-nights and went
toward their respective staterooms

 as captain mac made his way to the
bridge there were so many questions tum-
bling about in his head that he did not know
which to attempt to answer first

  who had murdered kelly who was the
man kelly had sent for donohue knew
but wouldnt tell because taber had mo-
tioned him not to why did donohue
obey taber and at the same time dono-
hue had been defiant toward him what
was there between them who was taber
anyway

  there were other questions who had
attempted to murder the room steward and
why how had he been stabbed while on
the open deck with no one near had the
knife been thrown perhaps thought the
captain but what had become of the knife
and what had become of the other knife
the bone-handled one that kelly had been
killed with had taber somehow dis-
posed of it ah there was taber again

  taber was friendly with dumphries but
surly toward every one else still he had
offered to share his room with donohue
and donohue had accepted tabers offer
in preference to harmless-appearing little
dumphries was donohue trying to gather
evidence against taber was taber plan-
ning to murder donohue

  all these questions and many others
remained unanswered as captain mac
rolled into his bunk and closed his eyes

shortly before ten the follow-
ing morning the stewards passed
the word throughout the passen-
ger quarters that all passengers
were requested to assemble in the social
hall they were not slow in obeying the
request rumors had been flying and
curiosity brought the passengers quicker
than a peremptory order backed by force
would have

  the meeting strictly speaking was not
an inquest the passengers seated them-
selves or stood about the captain who
quickly gave them an outline of the events
of the night before the passengers buzzed
but became silent and attentive as the ships
surgeon testified that kelly the detective
was dead-had been killed by being stabbed
several times in the back with a sharp-

pointed weapon probably a knife the
steward pietro shapiro his name was was
badly wounded but would probably re-
cover his wound was not exactly a stab
it was more of a slice a sharp-edged weapon
having passed across his throat from the
side missing the jugular vein but partly
severing a neck muscle having lost much
blood he was in a comatose stale the
surgeon would not commit himself as to
when he thought the steward would be able
to answer questions

  at this point captain mac addressed
them

  now it may be that some of you have
information that would partly or entirely
clear up this mystery if so i should be
grateful for your assistance in bringing the
murderer to justice

  an abundance of information came from
the passengers but when sifted it proved to
be of little value one woman had seen
a suspicious-looking man prowling about
at ten oclock or a little before no she
could not identify him in fact she had
seen only his back and that from quite a
distance another had heard a low-voiced
conversation outside her room but had not
been able to make out the words-of
course she added quickly i didnt try to
do that an uncertain old man said that
he had seen two men talking together
about midnight or maybe it was only about
eleven-thirty he had risen for a drink of
water and happened to glance out the
window one of the men had on a white
jacket must have been a waiter or stew-
ard the other well he did not know
couldnt be sure anyway seemed like the
other man was big with broad shoulders
like-like-the old man looked around-
like mr taber

  i was in the smoking room playing
looker with mr dumphries and three other
gentlemen from eight to after midnight
growled taber without even turning to face
the faltering old man

  well nobody was being accused-taber
neednt get sore on second thought the
broad-shouldered man of the night be-
fore might have looked more like the
chief officer what was his name-shat-
tuck

  shattuck shook his head and spat dis-
gustedly out a port

  was the man in uniform well maybe
the old man wasnt sure did he have on a


adventure

uniform cap seems like he did or no was
he bare-headed now well-

  the old mans wife reached out for him
and he retired in confusion

  captain mac dismissed them with thanks
if the meeting was not really an inquest
its finding was of as much consequence as
such findings usually are nothing of im-
portance had come to light a man had
been killed and another wounded by a per-
son or persons unknown the mystery was
still a mystery and since there was not even
a likely clew not even a suspect seemed
destined to remain so

  of one tiling captain mac was certain
at the bottom of it all were three kegs of
gold perhaps poor kellys talk of a master
criminal had not been so wild after all

  donohue seemed to have become sud-
denly knowing and hopeful as if he had got
a glimmer of light where captain mac had
failed as the captain left to go above he
saw that the detective had cornered the be-
wildered old gentleman and was plying him
vigorously with questions while big taber
beside whom stood round red-cheeked
little dumphries looked on with frowning
disapproval

  the combination of donohue taber and
dumphries seemed past all understanding
captain mac was a tough two-fisted fight-
ing man but not a detective it seemed
that the most he could do would be to
make a full report to the authorities upon
the vessels arrival in port

jjwj the days passed while the pcn-
guin steamed steadily on her
southerly course she passed wat-
ling island and entered crooked
island passage left castle island astern and
rounded whitehorse point and entered the
gulf of gonave just one hundred hours
after leaving new york they had lamenline
light abeam and since it is against the law
of haiti to enter any port of the black
republic between the hours of  pm and
 am they were forced to drop anchor
outside the port-au-prince harbor-buoy

  it was a beautiful night and nearly all of
the ships passengers were on deck some
leaning on the rails and watching the star-
tracked surface of the bay as they talked
others in groups of deck-chairs beneath the
awnings port-au-prince and the hills be-
hind loomed in the dark like a giant christ-
mas tree loaded with twinkling lights

now and then a charcoal fire blazed red in
the wooded hills to the southward then
died

  a group had gathered on the forward
end of the promenade deck just beneath
the bridge round-cheeked little dum-
phries was telling them of the trials and
tribulations of a brooklyn butchers life
and his clear voice carried to captain mac
on the bridge

  oh theres plenty of work to the butcher
business for years i stood behind a
counter from early morning till six oclock
at night twelve on saturdays to look at
me little fellow like i am you wouldnt
think i could wrestle big fores and quar-
ters around hang them-on hooks in the box
take them down and throw them on the
block and chop them up but i can hard
work but i had my fun too sometimes
on sundays id take the old lady and the
kids to prospect park and put the kids on
the swan boats how the little geezers did
enjoy it or sometimes wed go to the
island

  now the old lady and the kids are out
in pennsylvania and im here glad to
be here too im going to have a good
time first time i was ever away from
home alone im no rounder you under-
stand but im no mossback either and i
havent forgot how to step out just wait
till we hit old colon-eh taber

  he laughed as he had a habit of doing on
the slightest excuse his laugh was catch-
ing however and the others laughed with
him at nothing and loudest of all laughed
taber his lions roar booming out as if at
some great joke the others became sud-
denly silent there was a strange threat-
ening note in the surly mans laugh and
only care-free little dumphries seemed not
to mind it in his sprightly way he went on
to tell them of how he had earned the right
to call himself brooklyns best butcher
- a native fishing boat slid silently by its
patched and dirty sails standing out for a
while in the glare of the steamers lights
then it was gone

  say did you see that exclaimed
dumphries

  some of them had noticed the fishing
boat others had not

  just think went on the butcher a
boat like that could come alongside this
ship at night after everybody was asleep
and nobody would know it couldnt it
three kegs of specie



  the men on watch would see it put
in one of them

  oh are there men on watch all night
when the ships at anchor like this

  oh yes

  how many men

  well im not sure mr dumphries
but- heres the chief officer ask him
mr shattuck who had been passing was
stopped and the question was pul to him

  well theres always a quartermaster
on watch most of the time on the bridge
the mate told them if the gangway is
rigged out hes there then theres a sailor
who acts as assistant to the quartermaster
then theres an officer on watch youre
liable to find him any place in freight
ships they usually turn in and sleep but in
passenger ships they have to be up and
around youll usually find him at the
gangway or on the bridge or in his room
or maybe swapping lies with the purser or
engineer or whoever happens to be awake
then there are the men below decks the
engineers gang

  but they wouldnt know if a boat came
alongside

  not likely unless they happened to pick
that time to sneak above for some air

  it wouldnt be so easy as i thought
then said dumphries thanks mr
shattuck

  youre welcome said shattuck and
passed on

  an hour or so later captain mac came
upon taber shattuck and donohue talking
together on the saloon deck donohue
caught the captain by the sleeve and
stopped him

  im after em capn he said enthusi-
astically the guys that killed poor
kelly i mean there was one guy did it
but some others mixed up with him youd
be surprized at all the information i been
pickin up since that night i get a little
bit here and a little bit there then i piece
it together till it looks like somethin i
havent got what youd call brains but im
a pluggin sort of a biscuit

  why do you know he went on i can
tell you how that murder was committed
and all about it

  you can exclaimed captain mac
what dyou mean asked shattuck
leaning forward

  well i can tell you everything but who
did it

  hr-rumph snorted taber derisively

  ill tell you how it was theres a big
criminal aboard here a super-criminal like
kelly said and hes got a gang with him
i cant tell you who he is yet i aint cer-
tain that i know for sure anyway kelly
thought he knew but maybe he had the
wrong guy in mind anyway kelly was
on his track and thats why he was killed

  do you mean this master criminal did
it asked captain mac

  no-o i dont think so i think one of
his gang did when the room steward went
to look for this big crook he happened to
come up with one of the gang do you
know where mr so-and-so is sir asks the
steward what do you want him for
asks the other guy mr kelly the com-
pany detective wants him answers the
steward he does does he what does
he want him for asks the other guy i
dont really know sir says the steward
but i did hear im say somethin about
pinchin im he told me to keep my
mouth closed sir and i hope you wont let
it go on

  well as soon as he gets away from
the steward this guy comes below peeks
in kellys room sees hes alone and sticks
a knife in his back you see this guy
dont know that there are two of us de-
tectives aboard and he thinks hes savin
so-and-so by croakin kelly theyre after
three-quarters of a million and wont let
anything stand in their way hes in such a
hurry to get out of his room that he forgets
to take the knife with him and about
that knife - darn if i know where it
went to

  and why was the stewards throat cut
asked taber

  well maybe the steward happened to
come along and look in the window and
maybe he got frightened and didnt know
what to do and while he was standing there
this murderer came along and tried to kill
him so he couldnt put us on the track

  and then what did the murderer do-
sprout wings and flutter away asked
taber sarcastically

  well i told you there was some things
i havent figured out yet but im on
the trail dont you worry about that i
might go stumblin along and fall down
once in a while but ill get there in the end
i expect to have the goods on this guy
within twenty-four hours


adventure

  the police are investigating rumbled
taber

  wise cracks dont make any impression
on me retorted donohue complacently

  thats right donohue do what you
think is right said captain mac

  waste of time i think said shattuck
why not let the people ashore worry about
it

  aw let him alone put in taber sourly
hell wind up by getting his liver carved
or his head cracked then hell be satisfied

gsgis caff ain mac left them and
made his way below to the main
deck on a soap-box before the
door of the specie-locker sat a
seaman a navy colt belted to his side
the captain had given orders that the lock-
er be constantly guarded while the ship was
in port and that the officer of the watch pay
it frequent visits

  the seaman rose quickly as the captain
advanced

  everything all right asked captain
mac examining the padlock on the door

  yes sir all right answered the sailor
touching bis cap aint seen nothin sus-
picious sir nobodys been around but
some coal-heavers and i chased em in short
order the lazy bums they was just tryin
to hide out on the water-tender then i
hadda tell a passenger that he wasnt al-
lowed below here

  a passenger

  yes sir a big bloke with a mouth like a
bulldog he just growls at me and goes off
mad if he wasnt a passenger and me a
sailor i think id a took a poke at im
sir

  keep everybody away from this locker
i mean both passengers and crew they
dont have to use this passageway keep
them out you can sit down and smoke
your pipe if you want but keep your eyes
open

  thank you capn ill keep my eyes
peeled all right

  captain mac returned to the bridge
where he met the third mate who was about
to go on watch

  keep an eye on the specie-locker mis-
ter the captain told him and dont be
afraid to call me if you want me

  yes sir answered the third mate and
went below

  at eleven oclock captain mac turned in

as he would have to be up early to take the
ship to the wharf all night alert able
men would be on watch the ship was in
a harbor of a country policed thoroughly by
u s marines and native gendarmerie and
the captain fell asleep scoffing at the idea
that any number of men no matter how
clever or how well-laid their plans could
successfully plunder the penguins strong-
room and get away with over a ton of
specie

  it was still dark when he awoke or
rather was awakened by voices on the
bridge just forward of his sleeping room

  no cant sleep ate too many o them
bananas we got from that bumboat i
guess this was mr shattucks voice
thought i might as well get up anyway i
want to call chips pretty soon and shorten
up on the anchor then i want him to
knock the wedges off the hatches so we can
begin to open er up soons the crew is
called you might as well turn in and get
a couple hours sleep mr simms the old
girl dont need two of us on watch at the
same time ill take er

  youre welcome mister shes all yoursl
me for the hay

  footsteps sounded outside the captains
door as the second mate passed on the way
to his room the chief mate could be
heard descending the bridge ladder

  the captain sat up the radium-dial
clock at the foot of his berth said it was two-
tliirty oclock he hoped mr shattuck
wouldnt take in too much anchor chain
though shattuck seemed an experienced
officer he had been in the penguin but five
days and the captain wasnt sure of him
an inexperienced mate could very easily
make the mistake of taking in so much
chain that the flukes of the anchor would be
turned up out of the bottom allowing the
anchor to drag a ships anchor is a tricky
thing

  thinking he had better look to the short-
ening up of the anchor chain himself cap-
tain mac arose and dressed he went be-
low through the social hall and saloon and
came out upon the port side of the saloon
deck where a gangway had been rigged for
the pilot and doctor when they should come
out at six oclock on the upper platform
of the gangway beneath a shaded drop-light
stood the quartermaster on watch

  where did mr shattuck go quarter-
master asked the captain
three kegs of specie



  he went below about fifteen minutes ago
sir he probably went to take a look at the
specie-locker he told me to stay here
sir-not to move

  thats right

  captain mac waited about ten minutes
but as the mate still did not come on deck
the captain started below as he neared
the bottom of the ladder a narrow inclosed
ladder with an abrupt turn halfway down
he saw that the main deck lights were out
wondering he felt his way along the
dark fore-and-aft passageway toward the
thwart-ship alley that led to the specie-
locker

  there were no passenger quarters on the
main deck forward in the bows was the
sailors forecastle and aft beneath the poop
was the firemens forecastle the fire-room
fiddlcy and engine-room trunk were arnid-
ship separated from each other by the alley-
way into which opened the specie-locker
far below were the fire-room and engine-
room and part way along the sides of the
latter were reserve coal-bunkers that ex-
tended forward to beneath the thwartship
alleyway

  it was the corrugated surface of a bunker
plate beneath his feet that told captain
mac when he was at the intersection of the
two passages he felt his way around the
corner and opened his mouth to call to the
guard at the locker but he did not call
instead he crouched low on his toes his
wiry body tensed and one hand stretched
out before him

  crouching there tensed his every sense
alert it seemed to him that he had his
fingers on the very pulse of the ship and he
heard sounds that he had not heard con-
sciously for years from the engine-room
came the monotonous clack and thump of
a pump and the drone of a motor from
the fire-room came the clanging of slice-
bars and shovels and the clatter of an iron
bucket being dragged over floor-plates the
ash-hoist was clashing and banging as it
lifted ashes to be shot into the bay by the
ejector somewhere steam was escaping
these are the sounds that cause passen-
gers sleepless nights but that a steamship
man hears no more than a traffic policeman
hears the roar of the traffic

  all these sounds came with startling dis-
tinctness but closer almost within reach
of his outstretched hand there was some-
thing else-breathing the strained jerky

open-mouthed breathing of a man who is
trying hard not to be heard

  the little captain moved forward very
very softly a few inches and crouched
lower ready to spring one hand feeling
before him the other clenched at his hip
ready to strike out as soon as he was sure of
direction and distance

  again he edged forward and cautiously
described an arc in the darkness with his
outstretched left hand it took iron cour-
age and tight-reined nerves to feel about
like this in the darkness for an invisible op-
ponent perhaps for a man who had already
committed one murder and attempted an-
other a dangerous reckless criminal who
would stop at nothing

  he heard the rustle of clothing and at the
same time his finger-tips brushed against
cloth captain mac leaped and swung his
right fist in a short arc heard it plop into a
soft yielding stomach and a whistling gasp
as the breath was driven from the others
lungs the unknown went down and the
captain anxious not to let him escape fell
on top then a light flashed in his face
blinding him and something hard crashed
against the back of his head there was a
shower of red white and blue stars an
agonizing stab of pain in his head and he
collapsed unconscious

he seemed to come floating
up out of a vast black pit the
darkness lightened to gray and
forms began to take shape about
him words came to him from a great

distance cut the-thing easy now

thats it got away with it eh
yep clean away how about capn
mac is he coming out of it yeah help
me lift him up no let him lay on his
back thats the best way-never set a man
up when hes hurt

  captain mac wrenched himself into full
consciousness and forced himself to sit up

  now youre all right capn said a
voice just a crack on the head thats
all

  the man bending over captain mac was
an assistant engineer some feet away
stood shattuck the mate he was briskly
chafing his wrists to start the circulation of
blood near him on deck lay several
pieces of manila cordage and a handker-
chief that had evidently been used as a gag
taber stood near-by in one hand an open
io

adventure

pocket-knife an oiler and two firemen
stood gazing curiously from the starboard
end of the alleyway

  when the captain turned and looked
toward the specie-locker he saw that the
door swung open he reached up caught
the assistant engineers hand and raised
himself to his feet

  yep its gone capn said the engi-
neer in answer to the captains questioning
look

  all three kegs are gone sir put in
mr shattuck they got clean away
with it

  the captain went to the locker and
looked in it was indeed empty

  but they cant have got off the ship he
said unbelievingly

  they did just the same theyre gone
and so are the three kegs of specie

  you mean that they got clean away from
the ship its not possible

  oh yes it is insisted shattuck
theyve got a schooner a three-masted
tops schooner and they sent some men
alongside us in a small boat didnt you
see that topsl schoonerlaying off there
toward arcadins reef

  no i didnt

  well she was there just the same i
saw it as i came down from the
bridge

  i saw it too capn put in one of the
firemen a big-chested man with a blue
bandanna bound about his head

  so did i added the other

  the captain looked at them they both
wore dungaree trousers and sleeveless un-
dershirts and each had a grimy sweat-rag
knotted about his neck they both were
covered with a coating of coal dust

  how did you two come to see it asked
the captain

  we was up on the topside trimmin the
ventilators sir answered the one with the
bandanna it was a big gray schooner
with three masts we seen er in the moon-
light

  did you see the small boat

  we saw it when it pulled away sir
with the blokes in it pullin like blazes but
we didnt think nothin of it

  she was a motor schooner put in shat-
tuck i heard er making out while i was
hanging here with my hands tied to a beam
overhead with this noreast wind shoving
her on and her motors going for all theyre

worth she must be making between fifteen
and eighteen knots by now they must
have had the anchor a-weigh and when the
boat came alongside with the kegs they just
hooked her aboard and cracked on full
ahead

  no chance of us catchin er said the
engineer if shes makin as much as you
say she is	

  what became of the guard asked
captain mac looking around

  the docs puttin a coupla stitches in his
head answered the engineer somebody
smacked him on the nut i had a coupla
men help him up he aint hurt so
bad

  it was me that found you you know
he went on i come up from below and
saw the lights was out so i got a flashlight
and looked in the fuse-box and saw that
somebodys pulled a fuse i put another
one in and when the lights went on i saw
you layin there on your back and in front
of the specie-locker i saw the sailor what
was on guard and mr shattuck was triced
up with his hand to a beam and a gag in his
mouth then this gent comes along-in-
dicating the scowling taber-and we cuts
the mate down and i sends a coupla men
up to the doc with the sailor

  the captain turned to shattuck

  how did it happen mister

  i dont know capn the mate shook
his head and spread his hands with a help-
less gesture i came down about two-
thirty to see if everything was all right
briggs the sailor was sitting there on the
box and when he sees me he gets up-and
then the lights went out i heard briggs get
cracked then about four guys jumped on me
and one of em gets a strangle-hold from
behind so i couldnt yell then they triced
me up and puts a rag in my mouth and i
could hear em knock the padlock off the
door with a maul one of em had a flash-
light and he flashed it around while they
were rolling the kegs to the crews gangway
door and into the boat then you came
along but i couldnt yell and warn you on
account of the gag they downs you and
gets away thats all i know

  which side of the ship was the boat on
  the starbrd side sir

  hmm then the quartermaster didnt
see it

  i dont see how he could but we can
ask him
three kegs of specie



       captain mac looked at ta-
ber the big man was silent and
sullen and in his dogged way
seemed to be pondering deeply
and how about you mr taber asked
the captain

  well

 how did you come to be roaming
around at two-thirty in the morning

  i was just roaming growled taber
  any explanation

  nope none at all capn

  im afraid i must insist i dont know
what you have to do with this affair but
im certain youre mixed up in it some way
for i meet you at every turn always
youre near-by when something happens if
you refuse to make a full explanation right
here and now ill have to turn you over to
the authorities at cristobal

  do that capn said taber entirely
unconcerned

  he seemed too occupied with his thoughts
to pay much attention to anything else
he suddenly looked up however and
barked-

  how about that schooner-can she get
away

  not a chance answered captain mac
she hasnt a chance in the world shell
be captured inside four or five hours

  her being a topsl schooner ought to
make it easier put in shattuck i dont
think there are more than half a dozen
topsl schooners in the world and they
wont have any trouble recognizing her
oh that may be just a false rig said the
captain they may be making her back
into a regular fore-and-af ter right now and
they could paint her a different color inside
a few hours but that doesnt make any
difference the marines will hold every
schooner they get their hands on no matter
what her rig or color

  captain mac and mr shattuck left them
and vent above to the saloon-deck where
they stopped and questioned the quarter-
master still standing by the gangway on
the port side

  no sir said the man i havent seen
any boat or any schooner the way were
layin i cant see over toward arcadins and
i couldnt see a boat come alongside the
other side of the ship anyway

  have you seen any one on deck asked
the captain

  well i saw that big gentleman with the

black suit and the black hat pulled down
over his eyes then that little fat feller
that tells everybody about what a good
butcher he was in brooklyn he was out a
little while ago wearing a bathrobe and
slippers-said he didnt feel good and
couldnt sleep he went around to the
other side and i didnt see him any more
thats all sir i guess-oh no whats-is-
name-donohue the company flatfoot was
lookin out his window a while back just
before you came down from the bridge and
mr shattuck stopped and talked to him as
he went by i heard donohue say oh
ill get im dont worry about that the
bracelets are as good as on his wrists now
im gettin closer to im all the time then
mr shattuck said something low and went
below

  captain mac turned to shattuck

  what did donohue mean-that he ex-
pected to capture the man who murdered
kelly

  shattuck snorted contemptuously

  yeah the poor nut cant forget that hes
on the pay-roll as a detective

  maybe hes not so stupid as you think
hes persistent at least

  humph snorted shattuck again
leaving the mate standing by the gang-
way with the quartermaster captain mac
went above to the wireless room on the
bridge deck aft he roused the operator
who was drowsing in a chair before his ap-
paratus and told him to get in communica-
tion with the port-au-prince radio station

  phrase the message any way you want
said the captain inform the commanding
officer of the american occupation that this
ship has been robbed of three-quarters of a
million in gold coincontained in three small
kegs we suspect that it has been put
aboard a gray three-masted topsl schooner
which was lying somewhere between the
outer harbor buoy and arcadins at two-
thirty this morning ask him to take
whatever measures he thinks necessary to
recover the specie and capture the robbers
the operator was surprized and curious
but dared not ask questions and silently
scribbled the message on a pad

  very well sir ill send it immediately
captain mac was very thoughtful as he
left the wireless shack the impossible had
happened the ship had been plundered
of her specie in spite of his conviction that
it could not be done he felt certain that




adventure

there were men aboard the penguin who
were connected with the robbers per-
haps the ring-leader himself was aboard it
was maddening to think that he had had his
hands on one of the gang and had not been
able to capture him and he had not so
much as a glimpse of a face to console him
he had seen no one neither had shattuck
or the guard or the quartermaster or any
one else whom he could trust to aid him
taber bewildered him entirely and he knew
not what to think

day was breaking now going
to the bridge the captain took
the binoculars from their box and
swept the surface of the gulf the
off-shore breeze was freshening and a fleet
of native boats was skimming toward
gonave island a brown-sailed sloop was
putting out from behind lamentin point
and two more were coming from the
haitian navy yard but nowhere within
range of his binoculars was there a schooner
with square topsails or otherwise she had
a good start he reasoned and by now must
be nearly twenty miles on her way to the
windward passage even so there would
be small chance of her eluding the airplanes
that would be sent after her from port-au-
prince

  mr shattuck came out upon the fore-
deck and called up to captain mac

  im going to shorten up now capn
  all right nine fathoms mister

  nine fathoms sir

  he started toward the forecastle-head
shouting for the carpenter as he went

  hey mr shattuck come quick
cried a voice murder dead-dying-
who-what talk so i can understand
you you woodenhead thundered the big
mate who was murdered and where
is he

in his room panted the quartermaster
that big man with the black suit and hat
found him mr donohue the detective
you mean that donohue has been mur-
dered

  yes sir the big passenger told me to
call the doc and i did

  well-

  shattuck hesitated

  you go forrd and shorten up mister
ordered captain mac im coming be-
low myself

  another man murdered donohue this

time who next moaned captain mac
as he made his way below to the saloon
deck passenger quarters

  but donahue was not dead nor was he
even badly wounded he was on the oper-
ating table in the sick bay and was hotly
cursing his ill-fortune not in being wounded
but because he had not seen the man who
had attacked him

  donohue had not heard of the robbery
taber for some reason that donohue did
not or could not explain had been up all
night and his continual coming and going
had made the company detective restless
after talking through his window with
shattuck he had returned to his berth
and tried to sleep he heard some one in
the room and thinking it was taber he
twisted about to speak to him his half-
turn probably saved his life a knife de-
scending slid off his shoulder-blade and
ripped a six-inch gash in his back the
would-be assassin had lost his knife and to
hinder the rise of donohue he had tossed
on top of him the bedclothes from the
berth above and so made his escape un-
recognized taber entering the room a
few seconds later foimd donohue trying to
stop the flow of blood with a torn sheet and
had helped him to the sick bay a few doors
along the corridor then the big passenger
had sent the quartermaster for the captain
or one of the officers

  what became of the knife asked
captain mac

  here it is capn answered taber as
he handed the captain a wooden-handled
clasp-knife that had an inch or so of its blade
broken off

  the ships surgeon was bending over
donohue who stripped to the waist lay
face down on the table

  the point of the knife broke off and is in
his back just beneath the skin exclaimed
the surgeon

  he began to probe in the wound with a
pair of tweezers

  now this wont hurt you donohue-
he began

  rats snapped the detective gripping
the table edge you aint talkin to a

kid

  well then itll hurt like- answered

the surgeon angrily hows that

  better im a tough potato-dig away
doc

  tabers eyes glinted for a moment with
three kegs of specie



admiration then the disgruntled look came
again to his face

  hr-rumph he snorted then after a
pause donohue youd be a good detec-
tive but for one thing-youre dumb
blah retorted donohue youre not
so smart as i thought you were im
dumb and i know it youre dumb and dont
know it and wouldnt admit it if you did
keep still donohue warned the sur-
geon and to taber please dont talk to
him till this is over

  you had better leave the room mr
taber put in captain mac we ap-
preciate your help but youre a bit too
officious for a passenger

  taber shrugged snorted and passed out
of the sick bay

captain mac left immedi-
ately after and turned to go for-
ward as he passed dumphries
room the red-cheeked little butch-
er put his head out the window

  how is he captain

  who

  mr donohue is-is he all right i
mean will he live

  hell live how did you know about
him mr dumphries

  why i saw mr taber helping him to
the doctor and i guessed

  terrible isnt it captain he went on
i was so upset all night that i couldnt
sleep this man this murderer whos
aboard who is he going to attack next
why at this very moment he may be plan-
ning to murder you or me

  why you asked captain mac

  no reason i hope im just-just up-
set thats all im dreadfully nervous
im not used to things like this i wish i
had stayed at home

  he swallowed nervously

  i hope mr donohue isnt going to die
  oh no he isnt badly wounded
  thats fine

  dumphries gave a long sigh of relief as
the captain passed on

  the sun was up now and the stewards
had come from below and were hurrying to
get the corridors cleaned before the passen-
gers should begin to come from their
rooms on deck the boatswain and his
men were washing down they looked
curiously at the captain as he passed and
whispered between themselves the news

of the mornings happenings had spread
quickly as ship news always does and on
each tongue was the same question-
what next

captain mac declared a sort
of martial law aboard the pen-
guin six reliable seamen in
watches of two men each armed
with short heavy billies were to patrol the
fore-deck poop-deck and the two passenger
decks day and night as long as the vessel
was in port-au-prince and while she should
be crossing the caribbean to cristobal
the assistant purser freight-clerk and as-
sistant chief steward were to patrol the
passenger quarters including the dining
saloon social hall and smoking room and
they were given a loaded navy-type revolver
to pass from one to the other as they
changed watches the chief engineer de-
tailed three junior engineers to stand watch-
es on the main deck

  when the penguin went alongside the
wharf at six-thirty the captain ordered the
purser to place in several places aboard
ship a notice saying that none passengers
or crew were to be allowed ashore the
quartermaster at the gangway was told to
allow no one off the vessel unless accom-
panied by an officer and by arrangement
with the officer in charge of the american
occupation a united states marine was
stationed on the wharf to see that no
one got by the quartermaster there was
much grumbling aboard particularly among
the passengers but the order stood kel-
lys body was taken from the ice-box in
which it had been placed and sent ashore
to be embalmed and shipped to new york

  the entire haitian navy was putting
out from the navy yard to search for
the gray topsail schooner the fleet
consisted of lindependence erstwhile
american yacht with a personnel of eleven
natives commanded by three white men
two marine corps airplanes had passed
overhead shortly after six

  it came to light that others than mr
shattuck and the two firemen had seen
the gray schooner a fireman who was
to go on watch at four oclock had risen
beforehand to scrub some clothes the
washroom was used continually during the
day he explained and it was much easier
to scrub alone at night than when the room
was crowded with men scrambling for
adventure

water for steam and for pieces of un-
watched soap while scrubbing he had
glanced through a port-hole and had seen
the schooner in the faint moonlight also
he had seen the pulling boat leave the
penguin headed for the strange schooner
but had thought nothing of it at the time
there had been four men in the boat he
thought but wasnt sure he had not
seen the kegs the boat had been too far
off when he noticed it and he repeated that
he had hardly more than glanced at it
then resumed his scrubbing

  dumphries the brooklyn butcher too
had seen the schooner

  i dont really know what a schooner is
he told captain mac but this was a big
boat with sails and had two or three masts
-i didnt think to count them she was
either gray or white im not sure which
selling meat over a counter doesnt train
your eyes to pick out the colors of ships at
night- gosh i wish i was back there
he added with a comical twist of his head

  but how could you see the schooner
which was off the starboard quarter when
your room is on the port side asked
captain mac

  eh well ill tell you you see i
started to get a drink but instead of going
to the fountain in the saloon i got mixed
up and came out on the other side of the
ship to tell you the truth captain i get
lost every lime i leave my room im not
used to ships you know-

  i understand mr dumphries

  caplain mac quickly discovered that
there was no further information to be had
the passengers offered many suppositions
many solutions built upon the adverbs
perhaps and maybe but nothing that
the captain thought worth following up

  many of the women passengers were in
a state of mind bordering upon hysteria
several of them refused to leave their
rooms and one having locked herself in
shouted through the door that she was there
to stay till something is done though she
offered no suggestions as to the accomplish-
ment of that which she wanted done
some of the male passengers were frankly
apprehensive others were bolstering their
courage with loud threats and denuncia-
tion directed against the unknown assassin
several of the bolder spirits had even of-
fered themselves to the captain to patrol
the corridors and decks

  he thanked them but refused their
services saying that the trouble wasnt
lack of men but lack of information

  keep your ears and eyes open and come
to me the minute you come across anything
you think suspicious he told them
you can be of more help that way than
by standing around with guns in your
hands and try to keep the others calm
that butcher for instance hes been
blathering around all morning and hes
got half the women scared silly

rw the two airplanes returned
to port-au-prince before noon
their report was startling they
had not been able to discover
the gray schooner they had searched the
entire gulf of gonave but had seen noth-
ing larger than native sloops the aviators
thought that perhaps the schooner had
slipped into some inlet or into the narrow
channel behind cayemites island where it
would be partly hidden by trees it was
decided that in the afternoon the planes
should thoroughly search the coasts of
the gulf

  the penguin her port-au-prince cargo
discharged sailed at four oclock the
planes had returned and reported that they
could not find the mysterious schooner
though it seemed almost impossible the
schooner must have in some way slipped
out of the gulf they said and was now either
in the caribbean or headed northward to-
ward the open atlantic lindependence
also had returned to port with no news
the port-au-prince radio station had al-
ready broadcast a request that all ships
keep a lookout for the schooner and the
news of the robbery had been cabled to
new york

  the next morning after breakfast long
after the penguin had rounded cape dame
marie and been put on the course that
would take her across the caribbean to
panama captain mac went below to the
room occupied by donohue and taber
donohue was there alone his breakfast
had been brought to him and he was now
dressing awkwardly because of the band-
ages about his body

  donohue what do you know about
taber asked the captain abruptly

  donohue shook his head

  cant tell you that capn id like to
honest but i cant

asm
three kegs of specie



  you mean you refuse to tell me
we-ell i dont like to put it that way
i like you capn mac and id like to come
clean and tell you all i know but i cant
matter of what you call professional ethics
if you get what i mean i aint tryin to
be smart or anything like that capn
but i just cant tell you thats all

  this darn things got me dizzy he went
on with a gloomy shake of his head im
hangin on the ropes

  but youre not going to give up are
you

  no not me im goin to get the
guy that killed kelly if it takes ten years

but who the - was it he mused

it wasnt- he broke off leaving his
sentence unfinished

  wasnt who prompted the captain
never mind i come near sayin some-
thin i dont want to say

  captain mac left with a feeling of resent-
ment it seemed that he the master of
the ship was not considered worthy of the
confidence of a two-by-four detective he
told himself bitterly still perhaps dono-
hue was really sincere when he said that
he had not the right to confide in any one
perhaps there was some good reason why
he shouldnt disclose tabers business
aboard the penguin the captain liked
the unpretentious persevering detective
in a way and his anger faded quickly

  he went to his room and sent for the
surgeon and when the latter appeared
asked him-

  that man shapiro the room steward
who was stabbed-can he answer questions
why no sir not possibly hes semi-
unconscious and part of the time delirious
and ill be greatly relieved when hes off
my hands and in the colon hospital

  all right doctor thats all said the
captain wearily

  this was a disappointment indeed sha-
piro could he talk could give the name of
the man whom kelly had sent him for
and that man according to donohue was
the mainspring of the plot to steal the pen-
guins specie also he was doubtless the
murderer of kelly who had been about
to arrest him the attempted murder of
shapiro fitted in nicely with this theory
which seemed logical to the troubled cap-
tain but with shapiro unable to talk the
little fighting man felt that he had run
against a wall

  peace prevailed aboard the ship as she
steamed across the caribbean the special
watchmen were alert and expectant the
officers made frequent rounds but nothing
happened the tense feeling of apprehen-
sion among the passengers subsided dono-
hue as persistent as ever continued his
tireless questioning of passengers and crew
he still seemed hopeful but at times there
came a baffled expression to his face
dumphries soon got over his spell of nerves
and was again his merry self interested
in everything and making a nuisance of
himself by asking countless questions about
the ship and her crew he seemed especial-
ly interested in what the crew did while the
ship was in port this is all new to me
you know he would explain and when
i get home my friends are going to be asking
me the same questions im asking now and
i want to be able to answer now for
instance how long is this ship usually in
cristobal before she leaves again for new
york

  always at dumphries side was taber
the surly passenger and he seemed as in-
terested in some things as was the little
butcher though captain mac ever watch-
ful observed that taber appeared to pay
more attention to the questions asked by
dumphries than to the answers given

the penguin docked at cristo-
bal in the morning of the third
day after leaving port-au-prince
before allowing the passengers
ashore captain mac suggested to the canal
zone police authorities that they detain
taber they decided that taber should
be held as a material witness and a detec-
tive approached the big man as he waited
at the gangway placed a hand on his arm
and spoke in a low voice

  the big man turned looked at the repre-
sentative of the canal zone police frowned
thoughtfully for a moment then looked
at captain mac and gave a short grunt-
ing laugh then he nodded and went
quietly down the gangway

  the hatches had been opened and bag-
gage and cargo was being lifted from the
holds and swung to the pier the passen-
gers were streaming off the ship and min-
gling with the crowd on the pier a special
train had been run out on the pier for the
convenience of those who were going inland
or to the pacific side of the isthmus
adventure

  captain mac was pleased to hear that the
schooner had been captured but his satis-
faction faded when he learned that not one
but at least a dozen schooners were being
held in different parts of the world some
of them at impossible distances from the
scene of the robbery they were vessels
of all types colors and sizes it seemed
from a reading of the newspapers the purser
brought aboard that the principle result
of the search was a controversy as to what
was a topsail schooner one writer stoutly
asserted that a lopsail schooner was merely
a schooner with topsails and pertinently
asked if a schooner with topsails isnt
a topsail schooner then what is it for
three days the papers had been featuring
the story and all the way across the carib-
bean captain mac had been deluged with
frantic radiograms

  a representative of the u p and several
reporters of the local papers came aboard
asked questions made notes took pictures
of the ship of captain mac of donohue
to his delight of the specie-locker with its
door open and two men lying in the passage-
way to represent captain mac and the
guard and a man triced up by his wrists
to an overhead beam to represent mr
shattuck they were disappointed when
the captain and the mate refused to pose
personally for lliese pictures the captain
begged off saying he was not proud of his
failure to prevent the plundering of the
locker while shattuck refused point-blank
to be photographed at all in any position
triced up by his wrists or otherwise in
fact the latter became so incensed that he
punched a photographer in the jaw and
would have smashed the camera had not
captain mac interfered

  well let em keep away from me
snarled the mate i dont want my pic-
ture taken-if i did id go ashore and have
it taken right i dont want anybody

chasing me around the ship with a -

camera

  the reporters and photographers grinned
good-naturedly and went on with the
business of getting news as if nothing had
happened

  the next morning the purser brought
captain mac a cablegram from the owners
the captain glanced through it then read
it aloud

  penguin to be converted into oil-burner
at balboa shipyard pay off crew in full

and secure them transportation to new
york retain master chief mate chief en-
 gineer chief steward full instructions and
specifications follow

   that means that well haul out in the
 stream as soon as we finish discharging
 cargo he mused and a shipyard gang
 will take us through the canal to balboa
 an oil-burner eh well we must keep
 up with the times i suppose

 four days later the penguin
 her cargo all out was towed to
 an anchorage in the harbor the
 crew had been paid off and
 were to leave for new york on a ship that
 was sailing later in the day in the after-
 noon a shore boat look them each with his
 dunnage ashore the chief engineer went
 along to check them aboard the steamer
 that was to take them to the states

   the penguin was now like a dead thing
 her boilers cold her crew gone she was not
 the live pulsing ship she had been a few
 days ago those who were left aboard
 felt suddenly lonely they were glum and
 silent when they sat down that evening to
 eat the dinner the steward placed for them
 on one end of one of the long tables in the
 dining saloon

   the chief engineer came back from ashore
 and look his place across from the captain
 at the table

   did you get them aboard all right
 asked captain mac

   all but three the - gorillas

 guess i did pretty good at that answered
 the chief

    all but three eh

   yeah three of the pierhead-jumpers i
 signed on at the last minute in new york

 they got away from me in cristobal and
 beat it across the railroad tracks into colon
 theyre beachcombers at heart anyway
 those three bums they loafed all the way
 down and we had to boot em into the fire-
 room in lime for every watch thats
 how those two happened to see that schoon-
 er- they were loafing on the topside
 that was only a stall about trimming the
 ventilators

   oh were they two of them

   sure and the other one is the gink
 who said he was in the washroom he
 was probably snooping around the passen-
 ger quarters looking for something to
 steal
three klgs of specie



  hmm murmured captain mac

  so the three pierhead-jumpers were the
same three who had seen the topsail schoon-
er and they preferred to remain in colon
rather than go as passengers to new york
at the companys expense this knowledge
started a new chain of reasoning

  when specie is to be shipped the infor-
mation as to its route and time of shipment
is kept secret as long as possible ad-
vance information is not easily to be got
and the specie thieves who stole the pen-
guins gold must have watched every ship-
sailing for weeks the three firemen
reasoned the captain were doubtless mem-
bers of the gang the three men whose
places they had taken had been bribed to
stay ashore or waylaid or given drugged
hootch to drink in some speak-easy this
had been done as soon as the gang learned
that the specie was to be shipped in the
penguin and the three firemen members
of the gang had waited on the wharf to take
their jobs when the call should go out for
pierhead-jumpers as it was bound to do
these three men then were members of
the gang

  ami taber-

  the chief engineer here broke in on the
captains thoughts

  that grumpy big passenger they took
off here as a material witness-what was
his name taber thats him well i
saw him on front street this after-
noon

  you did

  yep he was strutting along like he
owned the town i didnt speak to him
i wonder how he got out i guess they
couldnt get anything on him or else hes
got friends higher up funny how he had
his nose in everything that happened he
stands in with the cops anyhow whoever
he is

  captain mac started sudden under-
standing flashed to him taber the three
firemen donohues refusal to tell who
taber was he had it now-no there was
a link still missing several links in fact
who killed kelly for instance and
who-

  say capn whered you get that stunt
asked the chief looking wide-eyed across
the table

  eh

  whered you get the idea of putting red
pepper in your coffee

  oh-i-i do that sometimes mr
barnes answered the captain weakly

  but it seemed that the little man did not
care for his coffee after all and left without
drinking it

  queer duck the old man commented
the chief to mr shattuck who had been
listening but saying nothing

  yeah

  a bad hombre to run afoul of though
said the chief shaking his head i was
talking about him today to donohue the

detec-

  donohue shattuck looked up quickly
where is donohue

  hes staying at the washington hotel
waiting for that fellow shapiro to get well

enough to talk

  how is shapiro

  he was pretty bad but hes getting bet-
ter now donohue says that little butcher
who was always asking fool questions hes
at the washington too

  is he shattuck seemed to have lost
interest well its a nice place to stay
the washington better than this blasted
ship thats sure

s captain mac spent at least
an hour in the main deck alley-
way by the specie-locker he sat
there on a box rolling and smok-
ing brown-paper cigarets and thinking
fitting new links to the chain his mind was
forging till the sun went down and the swift
tropic night came then he rose and went
above there was a buoyancy in his step
now and a sparkle in his eyes the chain
was nearly complete even to the explaining
of the mysterious disappearance of the
schooner

  the generators not being run the ship
was now forced to rely on oil lamps for
illumination the storage battery lighting
system was to be used only in an emergency
mr shattuck had hung an oil lantern over
the stern and was now running another up
on the jack-staff halliards forward satis-
fied that the lantern was secure and burning
properly he came upon the fore deck and
called up to captain mac on the
bridge-

  you dont mind if i go ashore now do
you capn

  certainly not go ahead mister are
you going near the washington hotel

  well i can if you want me to


adventure

  i wish you would i want you to de-
liver a letter for me to donohue the com-
pany detective

  all right capn said shattuck willing-
ly then i suppose well go to the coal dock
first tiling in the morning to discharge our
bunker coal

  most likely theyll have to get the
coal out of her before they take her in the
shipyard well probably go to the coal
dock about six oclock

  thats what i thought sir well til
be back aboard in plenty of time

  a half-hour later mr shattuck with the
chief steward went overside down the
jacobs ladder and into the small motor
boat made fast at the bottom mr shat-
tuck started the engine and took his place
beside the tiller

  you wont forget my letter mister
called the captain from the wing of the
bridge

  no sir ill deliver it answered the
big mate as the boat sheered out from the
ships side and headed for the cristobal
docks

  captain mac brought a deck-chair out
upon the bridge deck and began to roll and
smoke rigarets the chief engineer came
up after a while and perched on the rail
with his back against the weather-cloth

  theyve offered ten thousand dollars re-
ward for the arrest of the gang and the re-
covery of the gold he said and the com-
pany has offered five thousand for the man
who murdered kelly its in the papers
hmm well thats all right

  yeah for whoever gets it dyou think
anybody ever will

  i certainly do

  well maybe it wont be you or me
though capn

  hm answered the captain

  mr barnes went below to his room about
eleven oclock but captain mac remained
in his deck chair upon the bridge colon
bay was gray with moonlight once the
captain heard the pul-put of a motor and
saw a small boat headed across the bay
he looked at it through the binoculars but
it wasnt the boat he was expecting the
boat he was waiting for would contain men
in khaki and wide-brimmed hats-canal
zone police

  now whats wrong with that donohue
he muttered glancing at his watch didnt
he get my note

midnight came and still
donohue did not show up with
the police one oclock two
oclock then there came the
sound of a motor boat putting out from the
shore it was headed for the penguin and
soon captain mac saw through the binocu-
lars that there were five men in it he could
not distinguish their features but he could
tell by their dress that they were not police-
men the boats motor was stopped when
the craft was about two hundred yards off
oars were put out and the boat pulled
quietly to the ship it was made fast to
the jacobs ladder and the five men making
as little noise as possible came up one by
one and captain mac heard them coming
along the saloon deck toward the ladder
that led up to the promenade deck and the
bridge

  he slipped into his room snatched a
loaded revolver from the shelf above his
berth and returned to the bridge the first
of the men was already on the starboard
ladder coming up the captain turned
quickly to the port ladder went halfway
down and crouched there

  he saw the five men shadows in the
gloom beneath the bridge awning go to his
door softly open it and peer in while one
of them flashed a light

  hes not here said a low voice
thats funny

  maybe he went ashore said another

  mmm maybe

 or he might be hiding somewhere
aboard

  no i dont think so said the first
voice i guess he went ashore looking for
donohue

  yeah i guess he did wed better make
it snappy come on

  captain mac swiftly descended the lad-
der to the promenade deck entered the
social hall and went down the companion-
way to the saloon deck and ran aft to the
ladder that led down to the main deck pas-
sageway where he paused he could hear
the men coming along the oilier side of the
deck he leaped down the inclosed ladder
and went quickly along the passageway to
the place where the thwart ship alley inter-
sected it the crews gangway door was
open and the passage was lighted dimly
with moonlight there were a number of
oil barrels at one side and he slipped behind
two of them and crouched low
three kegs of specie

  the five men came through the alleyway
from the other side of the ship and halted
at the bunker plate a few yards from the
door of the specie-locker

  ill go forrd and get a light tackle
said one and well hook it to a beam and
haul em up one by one

  thats right this voice carried a note
of authority the rest of us will go down
and roll em out under the hole

  the bunker plate was lifted off and the
four men followed one another into the hole
their shoes clanging faintly on the iron rungs
of the ladder as they descended

  captain mac chuckled to himself he
started from behind the barrels but the
thud of a boats nose against the ships side
caused him to pause he ducked swiftly back
into concealment some one was coming up
the jacobs ladder from overside

  the newcomer did not continue up to the
open deck but stepped into the gangway
port and for a few seconds was putlined
against the sky he stood there bent for-
ward evidently listening then he came
with long silent strides to the bunker hole
where he stopped bent low and listened
again from below came the muffled voices
of the four men

  the man straightened and scratched his
head in puzzlement he looked slowly
about him till his gaze came to rest on an
oil barrel that lay on its bilge he gripped
the barrel by both ends and tugged at it
it was apparently full or nearly so for it
took all his strength to twist it about and
start it rolling slowly toward the open
bunker hole

  he checked the barrel as it neared the
bunker hole and seemed to compare the
size of the circular opening with that of the
head of the barrel he gave a short grunt-
ing laugh then rolled the barrel so that one
end partly covered the hole and taking hold
of the other end heaved mightily

  a shout of inquiry came from below but
it was cut off as the barrel slid tilted up-
right and became tightly wedged in the
hole its bilge being just large enough to
keep it from going through into the bunker

  a perfect fit grunted the man

  captain mac had been watching all this
with great interest he remained quiet
waiting to see what next would happen

  the man suddenly swung about and faced
the darkness forward it was the man who
had gone after the tackle returning when

he was about fifteen feet away he stopped
suddenly and peered intently through the
gloom at the man by the bunker hole
something glinted dully in the lalters
hand

  who is that demanded the man by the
bunker hole

 who is who me im the mate

what i want to know is who the-are

you he cautiously approached a few
steps oh taber now what the-

say what the-are you doing aboard

here

  never mind i want to know what
youre doing up so early in the morning
shattuck i want to know what your busi-
ness is

  oh you do well you got a lot of crust
asking me what my business is my busi-
ness is being mate of this ship thats what
it is were going alongside the coal docks
in a few hours and i got up early to rig
some of the life boats in

captain mac behind his bar-
rel was throbbing with excite-
ment here was another link in
the chain shattuck he also
had come aboard the ship shortly before
sailing the other chief mate had been
bribed to stay ashore and to write the letter
suggesting shattuck as a substitute shat-
tuck was a member of the gang

  im mate of this ship shattuck was
saying and its my job to be up and about
when theres work to be done whether its
early in the morning or early in the night
now how about you

  hr-rumph grunted taber and then
after some thought well i guess thats
all right ill tell you who i am im a
government detective we heard there was
a plot to steal that specie and the case was
given to me i guess youve heard of me
my names doyle nelson taber doyle
there was a note of pride in his voice
they call me blacky doyle

  o-oo- shattuck let the tackle he
had been carrying slip from his shoulder to
the deck blacky doyle yeah sure i
heard of you

  i guess most everybodys heard of me
said the big man proudly thats why i
cant travel under my right name i always
work alone donohue knew who i was but
i made him promise to keep his mouth shut
donohues a well-meaning sort of a fellow


adventure

but hes dumb-he almost spilled the beans
a couple of times

  i was working on this case all the way
down from new york he went on they
kind of put it over on me there in port-au-
prince though while i was keeping tabs
on the leader the rest of the gang was down
below getting away with the gold but i
just kept after the leader-i knew hed lead
me to it after a while i admit i fell for
that stall about the schooner but i wasnt
the only one

  what dyou mean-stall

  why dont you see there wasnt any
schooner that was just a story they made
up to throw us off the track they just
rolled the kegs along the deck and let em
drop into this reserve coal bunker then put
the cover on and then when they came
out tonight im right behind them in an-
other boat i was puzzled at first but when
i found out that they were down in the
bunker why i simply put that barrel over
it ha-ha wasnt that rich

  yeah thats rich agreed shattuck
stepping closer to doyle

  and the schooner gag-that was what
i call clever-

  the big detective broke off in the middle
of his sentence he tugged at the revolver
he had replaced in his pocket

  you said you saw the schooner too-
he had the weapon half out but he was
too slow shattuck had started a swing
with a limp black object that he had taken
from his pocket the blow seemed no more
than a slap yet doyle went down as if he
had been hit with a capstan-bar shattuck
did not attempt to strike again he knew
that another blow was unnecessary

  sure i said i saw the schooner mut-
tered shattuck looking contemptuously
down at the unconscious detective did
you just think of that youre a fine dick
you are you big mutt

  the mate had struck so swiftly that cap-
tain mac had not had time to interfere
revolver in hand he now rose from behind
the barrel shattuck had his back turned
and was tugging at the oil barrel wedged
in the bunker hole the little captain
walked quietly to him and put the revolver
against his side

  we wont take that barrel out of there
yet mister he said calmly

  shattuck jumped then caught himself
and half-turned

  oh is that you capn he said you
frightened me i just caught this guy here
snooping around and when i asked him
what he wanted-

  cut it snapped captain mac ive
been watching and listening for half an
hour i know all about you

  shattuck sidled closer the revolver was
pressed against his side it was held awk-
wardly stiff-armed had the captain known
more about firearms he would have stood
off at a little distance shattuck wisely
surmised that he was dealing with a man
who knew little about the handling of a
revolver

  well then he said assuming a beaten
air i guess the games up you got me
capn-

  he swung quickly his fist struck the

captains wrist and sent the revolver spin-
ning off in the darkness he swung again
this time for captain macs jaw

        but captain mac was in his
own element now he was much
more dangerous without a weapon
than with one he stepped inside
the arc of shattucks swing and his own
right fist dug into the big mates stomach
and continued on up till it crashed against his
chin shattucks head went back as a short
hook caught him on the side of the jaw and
spun him half around he fell on his side
on the deck and rolled over quickly to get
clear captain mac leaped after him but
tripped on the tackle and by the time he
had kicked himself free of the entangling
rope and blocks the mate had gained his
feet and had his blackjack in his hand cau-
tiously feinting for an opening to land his
wicked weapon he came toward the little
captain

  captain mac made as if to spring drew
quickly back let the mates swing go by
and chopped down with his fist at the side of
the others neck the mate swung back-
handed and the blackjack slashed across
the captains face

  one side of captain macs mouth lifted
in a leering fighting smile he worked in
close to the mate and his lean body seemed
to be made of steel springs as he bent and
twisted ducked or rolled with the big mans
frantic blows his fists swung and jabbed
and hooked at a dazzling speed and each
blow was directed at a vulnerable spot

  shattuck now knew that he was up
three kegs of specie



against a past master in the art of rough-
and-tumble lighting try as he would he
could not land his blackjack squarely the
little man moved too fast struck too quick-
ly and always the mates heavy swings
were a fraction of a second too late one
moment captain mac was out of reach
hen he was to one side or in close driving
short shock punches to the mates heart
or chin

  a gash had been opened above the mates
eyes and the blood partly blinded him he
began to back bent low his left arm pro-
tecting his face and his right hand still grip-
ping the blackjack his heels struck some-
thing and a quick glance told him it was
captain macs revolver

  all right capn i quit he grumbled

  captain mac nodded shortly and stepped
back

  shattuck tossed his blackjack to the deck
pulled out a handkerchief dabbed at his
bleeding forehead and let the handkerchief
fall seemingly by accident to the deck
he cursed stooped as if to recover the
handkerchief and as he straightened he had
in his hand the captains revolver

  he fired from the hip but missed and
aimed to fire again captain mac leaped
to one side then to the other a bullet
ricocheted off a beam and sang wickedly
past his head he dove for the oil barrels
along the side of the passageway but real-
izing that they offered only temporary pro-
tection he swung about with the intention
of throwing himself headlong at the man
with the revolver

  shattuck leveled his weapon and sighted
calmly then as his hand squeezed the
grip a shot crashed from the open gangway
port

  shattucks shot went wild he clapped
a hand to his hip darted a glance toward
the port then turned and started at a
shambling run in the other direction

  dont run you-murderer cried a

voice stand still or ill shoot your legs
from under you

  shattuck stopped one leg buckled under
him and he fell upon his side

  donohue  cried captain mac what
are you doing here i sent you a note
but i know now that shattuck didnt
deliver it

  i just came from the hospital and ive
had a talk with shapiro hes dying and
he confessed hes one of the gang shat-

tuck killed kelly thinking he was alone
then tried to kill me when i got too close on
his trail wheres taber

  hes been asleep answered the cap-
tain shattuck put him asleep with a
blackjack but hes coming out of it now
two canal zone policemen had come
through the port after donohue one of
them bent over shattuck

  broken hip i think said the police-
man straightening but dont worry old-
timer youll live to hang

  captain mac turned to donohue

  but who stabbed shapiro shattuck
was in the room with us

  i know it that was an accident sha-
piros being stabbed shattuck wanted to
get rid of the knife so he snapped out the
light grabbed his knife and threw it out
the window shapiro was outside lookin
in and the knife struck him in the throat
it was a big heavy knife you know

  the captain quickly told donohue of what
had happened aboard ship

  donohue nodded

   i kind o figured the gold was still aboard
here when i saw the gang start out all day
ive been watching them and waiting for
the doc in the hospital to send me word
that shapiro could talk when the gang
started out taber came after them and i
hung around the hospital taber was so
darn bull-headed that he wouldnt take any
cops with im-said he couldnt wait for
em and anyway he said he always works
alone smart onion

  captain mac picked up the tackle that
shattuck had brought from forward and
hooked it in a beam over the barrel a
rope strap was passed around the barrel
and the tackle hooked to it then the four
men tailed onto the running part and
heaved lifted the barrel out of the bunker
hole and swung it clear

  out of the hole came three men they
were the three firemen who had said they
saw the schooner the gray topsail schooner
that had been merely an invention of their
leaders mind they were grimy with coal-
dust and sweat and all were breathing
hard for they had been hanging to the
vertical iron ladder and straining lo shove
the oil barrel out of the hole they lined up
silent downcast and were disarmed and
handcuffed by the two policemen

  theres another one still down there
said captain mac


adventure

  donohue grinned

  sure i know it he shouted into the
bunker come on you we know youre
there

  feet sounded on the ladder a head
appeared then shoulders and out of the
bunker climbed little dumphries

  well gentlemen and here we are he
said

  he looked at doyle who was grumpily
nursing his aching head

  o-ho he said so you are a dick
after all i suspected you at first but later
i thought i was mistaken especially when
i lost track of you in colon well he
pursed his lipsthe breaks were against me

donohue had his revolver
trained on dumphries stomach

  hand over your gat butt
first he ordered be careful

  dumphries gaze was level and calm as
he looked at his captors and he smiled as
he took a small automatic from his pocket
and handed it to donohue

  you worried me a lot donohue he
said we didnt know you were a de-
tective till after-after somebody killed
kelly and that somebody was worried
too i can tell you as a detective youre
like a bull in a china shop but you manage
to get where you are headed for

  youre under arrest brooklyn barney
scheff said donohue and i warn you
that anything you say will be used
against-

  just so ill say no more

  captain mac was staring wide-eyed

  do you mean to say this man is one of
the gang he exclaimed

  hes the leader said doyle hes one
of the cleverest crooks in the world i
knew him by sight but donohue didnt
and i made him promise to lay off and not
arrest him till i gave the word i knew
there was a gang and wanted to bag em
all scheff is the man kelly sent for and
the steward went to shattuck who went
off half-cocked he thought kelly was
alone

  remember how dumphries - scheff
rather-climbed out the window when the
steward was stabbed on deck well he
knew that shattuck had thrown the knife
out the window and he guessed the rest
thats why he was in such a hurry to get
out he kicked the knife overboard

  well said captain mac dumphries is
the last man i would have suspected of be-
ing a member of the gang he was so good-
natured and timid

  humph snorted doyle hes one of
the cleverest crooks in the world i tell you
he can play the part of a minister or a
banker or a hard-working bookkeeper on a
vacation just as well as he played the part
of a retired butcher

  itll give me a rep catchin him mused
donohue

  say cut in doyle i want to tell you
right here and now that im in on that
fifteen thousand reward

  kellys family snapped donohue
the reward goes to kellys family i got
a better claim on the reward than anybody
else and captain macs got a better one
than you so where do you come in
donohue looked to captain mac for ap-
proval and the little fighting man nodded
vigorously

  the reward goes to kellys family re-
peated donohue firmly

  well thats all right agreed the big
detective after a moments thought and he
growled im not a bad guy

  the three firemen and scheff were or-
dered into the largest of the three boats
shattuck his hip broken by donohues
shot was helped down to them one of the
policemen followed the other was to stay
aboard to guard the three kegs of gold still
in the bunker till they should be sent for

  big doyle paused with one foot on the
jacobs ladder

  i still dont think youre much of a
detective donohue he growled but if
i took hold of you i might be able to make
something out of you if you want a job
 real detective job i can fix it up for you
vlaybe you and i could pull some big stuff
together what dyou say

  gosh thats what i been wantin for
ten years said donohue joyfully ill
take you up on that

  they went down the jacobs ladder and
into the boat

  the policeman who was to stay aboard
smiled to captain mac

  well capn and what do you get out
of it he asked

  we-ell i dont know answered the
little shipmaster rubbing his cheek thought-
fully darned if i know he repeated
and grinned back at the policeman

camp

fiie

ameetmbpface

   our camp-fire came into being may   with our june issue and since then
its fire has never died down many have gathered about it and they are of all classes
and degrees high and low rich and poor adventurers and stay-at-homes and from all
parts of the earth some whose voices we used to know have taken the long trail
and are heard no more but they are still memories among us and new voices are
heard and welcomed

   we are drawn together by a common liking for the strong clean things of out-of-
doors for word from the earths far places for man in action instead of caged by cir-
cumstance the spirit of adventure lives in all men the rest is chance

   but something besides a common interest holds us together somehow a real com-
radeship has grown up among us men can not thus meet and talk together without
growing into friendlier relations many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts
and guidance many a close personal friendship has our camp-fire built up between
two men who had never met often has it proved an open sesame between strangers
in a far land

   perhaps our camp-fire is even a little more perhaps it is a bit of leaven working
gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand-
ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood
he seeks few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing eo many
and such great extremes as here and we are numbered by the hundred thousand now

   if you are come to our camp-fire for the first time and find you like the things we
like join us and find yourself very welcome there ia no obligation except ordinary
manliness no forms or ceremonies no dues no officers no anything except men and
women gathered for interest and friendliness your desire to join makes you a member

during our discussion of the
hough-henry matter one com-
rade who had not known or
chanced to hear of jesse chis-
holm used his name in a supposititious gen-
erality that seemed only such to us without
any direct reference to jesse chisholm but
some of you seem to have made a different
interpretation and have risen stanchly in
jesse chisholms defense

  i do not think that among those who
knew him he needs any defense but i cer-
tainly do not want to leave uncorrected
any false impression that may have arisen
from anything prinled in our magazine
perhaps the quickest way to remove any

such impression is to give first a letter from
joseph b thoburn secretary of the okla-
homa historical society who as he himself
states it is not a party to any controversy
in this matter and is merely interested in the
correct statement of facts as they were as
you will see from his letter he is not
acquainted with camp-fires custom of
hearing opinions on all sides of a question
listening to them as opinions only and
forming its final judgment after considera-
tion of all of them

oklahoma city oklahoma

  my attention has just been callcd to the communi-
cation of w f g in the camp-fire of novem-
ber th  in which the writer asserts without


	adventure

corroborating evidence that one john s chism of from texas by a mr thompson but sold to smith
denton county texas was the originator of the mccord  chandler northern men in the indian

chisholm trail and not jesse chisholm who has
long been credited with having left his name to that
famous wilderness highway since you have given
place to this direct definite statement unsup-
ported by evidence of any sort to substantiate
it will you kindly permit by way of reply a
very brief outline of the earlier history of the
chisholm trail and the means by which it came
to be so named

in the latter part of the spring of  the fed-
eral garrisons of fort smith ark and of forts
washita arbuckle and cobb ind ter abandoned
those posts when threatened with attack of superior
forces of the seceding states the fort smith gar-
rison marched to fort washita thence the two
united marched up the valley of washita river to a
point opposite fort arbuckle where the garrison
of that post joined the column continuing its
march toward the northwest it halted near the site
of the present town of minco in the northern part
of grady county until the arrival of the garriosn
of fort cobb the entire force was under the
command of col wm h emory who employed
black beaver a very noted delaware indian
leader to guide the column through to its desti-
nation at fort leavenworth the route traversed
was in a direction slightly east of north it crossed
the arkansas river at the mouth of the little
arkansas where the city of wichita kansas has
since been built

  during the civil war the indians of the wichita
caddo and affiliated tribes lived at the mouth of the
little arkansas as refugees as they had adhered to
the union at the outbreak of that struggle with
them lived jesse chisholm a mixed-blood trader
a cherokee by birth but a member of several other
tribes by adoption a more honorable and upright
man never won and held the confidence and respect
of every one who knew him or with whom he had
dealings in the early spring of  when it was
apparent that the great war was drawing to a close
jesse chisholm and james r mead a white trader
loaded their wagons with goods for the indian trade
and started for the washita country on a trading ex-
pedition in doing so they merely followed the
faint traces of the trail made by the column of re-
treating federal troops nearly four years earlier
other traders afterward followed the same road
which they called chisholms trail this was
in the spring of -more than two years before
the first herd of cattle was driven through from
texas to abilene

while w f g is doubtless honest and sin-
cere in his belief that john s chism or chis-
holm for that was his real name protests to the con-
trary notwithstanding drove the first herd through
to abilene it is at variance with the facts there
arc hundreds of others who think as he does-all
upon the same hearsay evidence the cattle trail
from texas to abilene was the realization of a dream
of one joseph g mccoy an illinois cattle feeder
fifty years ago mccoy published a book in which
he told the details of the ealrly history of the over-
hind cattle trade in this book sketches of the
cattle trade of the west and southwest on page
 appears the following statement

  the first herd that arrived at abilene was driven

nation and by them driven to abilene however
a herd owned by colonel  w wheeler wilson and
hicks all californians en route for the pacific states
was stopped about thirty miles from abilene for rest
and finally disposed of at abilene was really the
first herd from texas and broke the trail followed by
other herds

  in addition to the foregoing evidence i have the
word of the late w p addington of oklahoma city
who year after year drove the chisholm trail him-
self and who was a friend and neighbor of john s
chisholm that the latter had nothing whatever to
do with the naming of the chisholm trail more-
over i have in my possession a letter from the late
colonel c c slaughter dean of trail drivers in
which he states very positively that the trail was
named for jesse chisholm i have no desire to take
issue with people from texas who are mighty fine
folks and who know or ought to know about such
matters but this is one in which oklahoma history
is at least as much concerned as texas history is and
in its last analysis the facts must be determined
upon credible evidence rather than hearsay however
popular and long current the latter may be-joseph
bthoburn secretary oklahoma historical society

est there should be any doubt of the
-i intended meaning of the original state-
ments the meaning which we in the office
got from them the maker of the statements
himself comes forward to wipe out any other
interpretation that may have been made

paris texas

  i have been informed that certain statements
made in an article in your magazine printed
during the course of the hough-henry discussion
have been taken as a reflection upon a real jesse
chisholm

  will you kindly make known the fact that in writ-
ing this article nothing of the kind was intended
the jesse chisholm of the book seemed to me of the
same class as tasie lockhart mcmasters jim na-
boiirs and others appearing in the book-that is
people who were created by hough for the purposes
of the book lockhart mcmasters and nabours
are all texas surnames but i never considered that
hough was using these names as denoting real people
or for the purpose of introducing real people either
from texas or the indian territory into a work of
fiction

  i regret very much that application of anything
in the article has been made to a real person-of
whose existence i was unaware-and thereby the
feelings of others hurt there was certainly neither
intent or purpose to cast reflections upon any real
person and i trust no one will again use any thing
in the article in this way because it was not written
with any real person in view but dealt with the char-
acters of the book as unreal and creations of the
author-w f g

d ead the following from a comrade
himself an old-timer of the west who
knew jesse chisholm intimately and prized
his friendship

carthage missouri

  jesse chisholm for whom the trail was named
the camp-fire	

was bom in the year  in the old cherokee coun-
try in east tennesec his father ignatius chis-
 iiolm son of john d chisholm the last hereditary
chief of the cherokees was of scotch dcscent and
was a half-brother of the maternal grandfather of
ex-united states senator robert l owen his
mother was a member of the noted rogers fami-
ly of the cherokee nation and an older sister
of tiana rogers the cherokee wife of general
sam houston

jesse chisholm was one of the most interest-
ing characters on the western frontier for thirty
years before his death he came west at an early
age and joined the western cherokees in arkansas
liis mothers brother john rogers being one of the
leading chiefs of that band this was years before
any of the cherokees settled permanently in the in-
dian territory and many years before the migration
of the main body of the tribe from their old homes
east of the mississippi

   he was with the war-party of tah-chec or
dutch a noted cherokee chief on its expedition
against the wacos on the brazos in  he was
of venturesome disposition and lived for a time with
the cherokees of texas he was first mentioned
as an interpreter by colonel henry dodge of the u
s army on his visit to the village of wichitas in 
in his later life he was said to be able to converse
or talk sign with fourteen different tribes through
the medium of sign language his services as an inter-
preter were frequently in demand by army officers
and indian service officials

 j n the early s he had a trading-post not far from

   where the old california trail crossed the south
 canadian later on prior to  he had a ranch
 and trading-post at council grove on the north
 canadian a few miles west of the present oklahoma
 city he took little or no account of liis hereditary
 tribe relationship as he had been made an adopted
 member of the wichita tribe

   when the wichitas went north to kansas at the
 beginning of the hostilities in  jesse chisholm
 went with them for more than six years the wich-
 itas remained encamped at the mouth of the little
 arkansas where the city of wichita is now

   in the spring of  jesse chisholm loaded sever-
 al wagons at ixavenworth kansas with goods and
 supplies and started on a trading expedition to the
 wichita country how thorough was his knowledge
 of the country between the little arkansas and the
 washita and how unerring were his instincts as a
 path-linder and a trail-maker is shown by the fact
 that years later the engineers who surveyed the line
 for the rock island r r southward from wichita
 seldom left the trail made by jesse chisholm more
 than a few hundred feet on either side such was
 the beginning of the historic chisholm trail

a portrait made from a photograph taken of
him at leavenworth in the fall of  shows
him as being tired worn out sick and physically a
mere shadow of the splendid man he had been a few
years before he had just returned from a long
hard trading trip a year and a half later april
th  he died as the result of accidental poison-
ing at his trading-post on the north fork of the
canadian of cholera morbus caused by eating bears
grease that had been poisoned by being melted in
a brass-kettle

  one account fa as it that he was buried near the
banks of the north canadian in what is now
cleveland county and another that he was buried
near the north canadian river in the north-
west part of what is blaine county his grave
is said to be unmarked perhaps you can help
us locate it

jesse chisholm was reputed to have been
prudent and frugal in his habits as a trader and
scrupulously honest in his dealings with other men
whether white or indian yet such was his charity
and generosity that though he conducted a prolit-
able business for years he never amassed a great
store of wealth it was said of him that no man be
he white or red ever came to jesse chisholm hungry
and was not fed or naked and was not clothed lie
subscribed to no creed save that of an inherent love
for his fellowman that he died universally la-
mented by all the indians who liad known him anil
deeply mourned by liis adopted fellow tribesmen of
the wichitas caddo and affiliated bands would
scarcely state it all for he had been a true friend
and a loving brother a wise counselor a just and
fair-minded arbiter and an honored patriarch among
them during years which had been filled with sorrow
and trouble

  jesse chisholms creed was depart from evil
and do good seek pcacc and pursue it or in his
own words

  i dont know anything about the bible i dont
lake any stock in preachers but the great spirit
has implanted in every mans breast the knowl-
edge of right and wrong i never wronged any man
i have done good to my brethren all my life and no
man ever went from my camp hungry or naked i
liavc been a peacemaker among my brethren and i
leave all of the future to the great spirit alone who
sent me here

  the old chisholm trail-and the story in all of
its wealth of detail has not and never can be written
its characteristic scenes are gone forever-r t
greer

in another letter from mr greer is
- some information that all by itself estab-
lishes jesse chisholm solidly enough as the
man after whom the famous trail was named

   i have just been informed by one of the committee
appointed by the governor of the great state of
texas to investigate the matter of who it was that
blazed the chisholm trail-whether it was col

john s chisum or jesse chisholm after thorough-
investigating the matter the committee have de-
cided that that honor belonged to jesse chisholm of
indian blood and not to col john s chisum
american

now that this matter is cleared up and
jesse chisholms real character and
accomplishment set forth in unmistakable
terms by those in position to know the
facts can we not go a little further and as
mr greer suggests see whether among us
we can gather data that will locate definitely
the final resting-place of this old-timer of the
west who has sent his name down in the
history of our country

here is something interesting
to add to our collection of infor-
mation on the bow and arrow as a
weapon it becomes easy to real-
ize at least in a general way what massed
archers meant as riflemen machine-gunners
or even as artillery

washington d c

  one of your contributors asks some questions and
gives some information about the release used by
various archcrs mentioning four different types as
the number of possible variants in addition to
his four there are two others one used by a tribe of
africans by which the whole hand is used in draw-
ing the bow-string and the release accomplished
with the aid of a u-shaped piece of thin board cov-
ering the palm and the second a release used by
the turkish soldiers and apparently inherited from
the professional soldiers of the byzantine empire
in this latter form the string is drawn without bend-
ing the fingers the arrow lies across the first three
fingers and is held by a silver or agate ring on the
thumb which is held tightly pressed against the
base of the forefinger and the release is accom-
plished by spreading the thumb and fingers ac-
cording to sir ralph payne gallwey who has made
a study of the subject this release gives an increased
range of many yards in flight contests pope says
his indian used the mongolian release

  according to the same authority the ranges ob-
tained with the turkish bow with flight arrows not
war arrows are indeed remarkable he quotes a
verified record in london of  yards with records
from contests in constantinople marked by monu-
ments on the archery grounds of from  to 
yards the turkish bow was a very complicated
affair it had a wood corc of three pieces with a
strip of horn on the inside and the outside built up
of small pieces of sinew held together by a flexible
glue and then covered with a thin piece of leather
or cherry bark the string was of sixty strands of
silk with sinew loops at the end the bow itself
was reflex that is when unstrung it bent into a
nearly complete circle in the reverse direction the
war bow had a pull as great as ico pounds although
the usual pull was  for what he calls the light
bow

  the english long-bow shot a heavier arrow with
an extreme range of less than  yards usually
 but was far easier and cheaper to make and
probably had as great hitting power at close ranges
i seriously doubt if it is possible to find any date for
its introduction anywhere as it is the natural de-
velopment of the bow after its first discovery and
use any boy who plays with the bow and arrow
will develop it in a comparatively short time its
advantage was its simplicity and speed and ample
hitting power at the battle-rangcs of the day in
which it was used this hitting power is not now
appreciated patritius an early writer on military
affairs says of it an english arrow with a little
wax put upon its head will pass through any ordi-
nary corselet or cuirass

  sir john smith writing some time in the latter
part of the sixteenth century is quoted as saying
archcrs being good direct their arrows with a
great deal more certainty being within eight   
to eleven scores of yards than any musqueteers
or harquebuseers however good they may be can

do in a much nearer distance i will never doubt
to venture my life among eight thousand good
archers    against twenty thousand of the best
musqueteers

  the same authority says that the archcrs could
stop armored mounted troops and that the arrows
falling from above were nearly as effective as those
at point-blank ranges and describes the terrible
effect of archery fire on attacking troops he as-
cribes the superiority of the long-bow over the cross-
bow to the speed attained in firing and consequent
ability to smother the enemys fire

  as an example take crecy the archers were
drawn up in a herse or hearse or rather in two
one on each flank this herse had a front of sev-
enty or seventy-five men and a depth of forty men
pope says he can fire the long-bow so that he has
seven arrows in the air at one time and that he be-
lieves it possible for an especially skilled archer to
have ten the shaft is supposed to be three feet
long it would be quite possible then to fire twelve
hundred lineal feet of arrow for each front man say
four feet of front in fifteen seconds all except the
two front ranks would probably fire at an angle of
 degrees to obtain a plunging effect apparently
those ancient writers who wrote of the hail of ar-
rows were right also consider that the average
distance was less than  yards and the arrows
were nail-headed armor-piercing affairs that could
be seen coming and yet not dodged

  i agree with captain john smith that it must
have been hard on the nerves one quite under-
stands what happened-alfrkd buehl

           state highway camp
           erie michigan

in the circumstances i think
there can be no objection if this
comrades letter is heard without
his name at the end of it here
at the office all our spare copies and all our
exchanges go to hospitals or prisons it
isnt much trouble or expense to do this
why cant we all of us do it oftener

  i have had a longing to throw a stick into the
camp-fire for a good many years so hope you will
let me sit in this once

  i read mr e r parrys letter about placing a
copy of the magazine under tamerlanes tomb but
i placed or rather caused to be placed hundreds of
copies in a living tomb-the states prison at jack-
son michigan

  when i was sentenced there three years ago there
were but a very few magazines in circulation there
but as i was given a job in the chaplains oflke and
library i persuaded the chaplain to form a maga-
zine club and to head the list with adventure which
has always been a favorite with me and believe me
i devoured the first copy that came in

  i am out on temporary parole to the state high-
way department along with about  other men
earning  per day putting in concrete roads at a
cost to the tax-payers that is at least  less
than a private contractor would charge i hope
that the time will soon come when every man con-
victed of a crime in the united states will be given
the same chances to make good that the governor
the camp-fire	

of this state and warden hulburt of jackson have
given these  men from the prisons of this state

  there is honor among thieves and michigan is
proving it every day men are men even if they
have traded their name for a number as i did in
 so in closing i will only sign my number
which i wish you would omit but in case any of
my camp-fire friends have books that they are
tired of i know that two thousand men would
thank them if they mailed them to the state prison

         once a woman reader a mother
r -iffrt protested against gordon youngs
use of the word whore in a
story and i defended his use of
it he uses it again in the serial begin-
ning in this issue but the fact that this
makes only twice in the eight years he has
written for us seems sufficient proof that
he uses it only when real need justifies

  in eight years of writing for adventure in writing
of harsh hard men and often of the women who
entangle their lives i have used the word but twice
it appears in days of  where i believe it is the
only word under heaven that would make col
nevinson strike as he does the dona elvira and that
blow must be struck in just that way or the story
falls the sequence and plot follow that word and
blow like a row of falling dominoes

    ore perhaps than most persons certainly far
more than persons who do not write i hesitate
to use often the word whore because as it stands
regarded now it is a word of power imagery finality
the language has too few of such saxon vividity
strong potent vivid words by misuse and thought-
less frequency become futile mere badinage as
hell is now a word for vaudeville jokesters and
the once anathematic damn mere slang on a
flappers tongue

regarding the opinion of your friend that
too much attention is given in the story to
women of ill-fame i can only say that i deal always
in complicated plots usually of turbulent or at least
emotional violence but whoever will take the
trouble to look closely at that sort of woman when
they appear will always find that their purpose is
that of a definite contrast i think the preacher in
that house of harlotry is probably the highest bit of
drama i ever got to one cant make a strong man
convincing unless there is something against which
he can pit his strength or a man nobly convincing
unless he towers above the ignoble san fran-
cisco and california of that day was a land of such
black-white contrasts take a specific and obvious
instance as when the miner is having his leg cut off
in mrs gubbins cabin and she the noblest of pure
pioneer women stands unshrinking before an oper-
ation at which the doctor shrinks-all this while
from afar through the night may be heard the
revelry with the other sort of women those
women are there though they of course have their
minor plot-places worked in to seem to justify their
presence not to show themselves but to show the


character of mrs gubbins through whom i tried to
pay a fitting tribute to the women-our kind of
women as the miner calls them-of 

  people who read or at least most of them dont
seem to realize that we who write-nearly all writ-
ers except youngsters who soon learn to do likewise
-plan rewrite change this build up that work for
carefully designed effects and whether or not these
effects arc pleasing or displeasing they are not ob-
tained by accident or inspiration one reader
may not like this aspect of a story another that and
in so far as this or that aspect fails to please any
particular reader though it be impossible to please
all difficult to please many the writer has failed of
his purpose and must accept blame he must stand
or fall ly what he has succeeded in doing not by
what he has tried to do he must use what judg-
ment he has but accept the readers decision as
final-however much he may choose to solace him-
self with such little phrases as being too good for
the public and going over the heads of the
groundlings-gordon young

 as the former occasion brought only
many letters endorsing the maga-
zines attitude on the use of the word in
question and as adventure has through its
nearly fifteen years of existence stead-
fastly proved its clean intent no repetition
of the defense seems necessary on its second
occurrence beyond stating our general posi-
tion that lip-morality and real cleanness do
not always coincide and that ignorance
and ignoring do not create or safeguard
cleanness

  as to having such women appear at all
in days of  this is a story of cali-
fornia in the mad wild days of the gold-
rush they were part and parcel of life in
that time and place no picture ignoring
them can be complete or real for they were
woven almost inextricably into ail the
threads of existence and occupied no back-
ground position under mr youngs han-
dling they are merely part of the setting and
minor cogs in the machinery of the storys
development if under his handling they
had even once been presented with a figura-
tive smacking of lips or squint of eye if they
had even once been given place for their own
sake if mr young had anywhere failed
to handle them with utter cleanness this
story would not have reached you in its
present form but you have never known
mr young to smudge a story with sex-
appeal and he does not do so in this one

  there are good women too in this story
and somewhat more of love-interest than
is usually found in our fiction as you
know women of any kind and the love-
element play small part in our pages so
far as possible we avoid stories containing
	adventure

any considerable amount of these elements
but sometimes there comes a story like
days of  that you would not be at all
willing to lose because of their presence in
it also stories constantly ignoring the
existence of one-half the population would
become a bit monotonous-and unreal
and mr youngs story is too living and
powerful a picture of one great stage in our
countrys development-

  i cant go on it is to laugh it is
pleasantly amusing that an editor should
feel a need-and there is a need-of apolo-
gizing for what is really a very very moder-
ate dose of entirely respectable women in
one story in his magazine it is amusing
also though not so pleasantly so that ad-
venture which has always kept itself whole-
some and decent should feel called upon to
defend the entirely non-salacious appear-
ance of some non-respectable women in one
of its stories while into our best homes is
freely received through most of our best
magazines fiction written largely by this
recipe for nine-tenths of the story enter-
tain the reader with a girls adventures in
the sex game and then in the hurried remain-
ing tenth register high morality by showing
that by the skin of her teeth she got away
with it and didnt fall after all

  those other magazines that brazenly
make plain their sex-appeal and depend
almost wholly upon it for their sale are at
least honest they are not hypocritical do
not enter the home in moral disguise to teach
immorality but our best magazines
many of them-bah an adventure writer
may use the word whore twice in eight
years but there are no adventure writers do-
ing wholesale pandering for pay or subtly-
or otherwise-broadcasting lax sex morality
at so much per broadcast

  it is a shame that days of  should be
introduced with any such discussion the
whole sex question being so very minor a
matter so far as it is concerned im not
given to praising our stories at camp-fire
but here is one built on so big a scale that
sex and the above discussion of it will be
forgotten in the reading

  and were trying an experiment its
customary for our writers in the case of a
story with historical setting to give camp-
fire an idea of the actual facts upon which
it is based pointing out deliberate varia-
tions for fiction purposes in this case
gordon young has gone further and gives

not only the particular reference but many
quotations that enlarge and make more
vivid our picture of the times they are
properly definite foot-notes to the text but
rather than impede the flow of the story we
have them at camp-fire instead so far as
space permits you can read them before
or after the story according to your taste in
such matters they will i think be found
more interesting if read afterward and will
not then betray any of the storys plot in
advance

  it is a remarkable circumstance that out of a
fleet of  vessels from american ports that sailed
around cape horn to san francisco in - not
one was wrecked or sustained any serious disaster
on the long and tempestuous voyage yet this
fleet was largely composed of old vessels that had
long been regarded as unseaworthy and in many
instances had been condemned but which had been
patched up and pressed into service again to meet
the exigencies of the occasion many and many a
ship entered the golden gate with pump which
had been almost constantly manned to keep it
afloat and many and many instead of coming to
anchor were run directly upon the mudflats of mis-
sion bay where they ended their sea-going days by
being transformed into storehouses hotels or board-
ing houses    it is an interesting circum-
stance that every one of these vessels entered the
harbor of san francisco and found an anchorage
without the aid of a pilot it is none the less singu-

established was there a single wreck to record of

  bancroft in california inter pocula p 
seq supplies this description with detail the
character of the typical gambler of the flush times is
one of the queerest mixtures in human nature his
temperament is mercurial but non-volatized
   supreme self-command in his cardinal
quality yet except when immersed in the intricacies
of a game his actions appear to be governed only
by impulse and fancy on the other hand his swift-
est vengeance and cruellest butchery seem rather the
result of policy than passion    he is never
known to steal except at cards and if caught cheat-
ing he cither fights or blandly smiles his sin away
suffers the stakes to be raked down without a mur-
mur treats good-humorcdly and resumes the game
unruffled united with the coolest cunning is the
coolest courage he is as ready with his pistol as
with his tooth pick but he never uses it unless he is
right then he will kill a man as mercilessly as he
would brush a fly from his immaculate linen   
he accustoms nimself to go without sleep and if
neccssary can go for several days and nights without
rest  he deals his game with the most
perfect sang froid and when undergoing the heav-
iest losses there is no trembling of fingers or change
of expression    his brightly polished weap-
ons are always at his elbow ready for immediate
use  he is studiously neat in his habits
and tends to foppishness

  the rocker or cradle appeared at the mines
within a few weeks after the discovery of gold its
invention or at least introduction is credited to a
georgian miner who happened to be in the neighbor-
hood hittell in his resources of california de-
scribes it at length p  seq it bears some re-
semblance in shape and size to a childs cradle and
rests upon similar rockers the cradle-box is about
forty inches long twenty wide and four high and it
stands with the upper end about two feet higher
than the lower end which is open so that the tailings
can nm out on the upper end of the cradle-box
stands a hopper or riddle-box twenty inches square
with sides four inchcs high the bottom of this
riddle-box is of sheet-iron perforated with holes
half an inch in diameter the riddle-box is not
nailed to the cradle-box but can be lifted off with-
out difficulty under the riddle is an apron of
wood or cloth fastened to the sides of the cradle-
box and sloping down to the upper end of it across
the bottom of the cradle-box arc two rifflc-bars about
an inch square one in the middle the other at the
end of the box the dirt is shoveled into the hopper

the cradler sits down beside his machine and while
with one hand with a ladle he pours water from a
pool at his side upon the dirt with the other he rocks
the cradle    the man who rocks a cradle
learns to appreciate the fact that the golden
sands of california are not pure sand but are often
extremely tough clay a hopperful of which must lc
shaken about ten minutes before it will dissolve un-
der a constant jxiuring of water many large stones
are found in the pay dirt such as give an un-
pleasant shock to the cradle as they roll from side
to side of the riddle-box are pitched out by hand
and after a glance to see that no gold sticks to their
side are thrown away but the smaller ones are left
until the hopperful has been washed so that
nothing but clean stones remain in the riddle and
then tie cradler rises from his seat lifts up his
hopper and with a jerk throws all the stones out
the water and the rocking are both necessary
without the water the dirt could not be washed
and without the rocking the dirt would dissolve very
slowly and the gold would most of it be lost   
the cradle is cleaned up two or four times in a day
the cleaning up is done by lifting the hopper taking
out the apron scraping up all the dirt in the bottom
of the cradle with an iron spoon putting it into a
pan and washing out the dirt so that only the gold
will be left    the great difficulty in mining
with the cradle is that the sand will pack or make
a hard mass on a level and the gold then is lost so
long as the cradle is in motion the dirt does not
pack but when the rocking ceases the mass hardens
in a few minutes-p  seq

a word from stanton c lap-
ham in connection with his story
in this issue he speaks a good
word for the men who frequent
the open places

lagrandc oregon

  out of years of experience and observation of
men in the open places it is my judgment that the
most humane class of men in die world are among
thoee who have hunted much who love adventure
and have lived near to the heart of things in the
great out-doors-stanton c lapham

following camp-fire cus-
tom colonel frank e evans
rises to introduce himself on the
occasion of his first story in our
magazine i had known him back around
 when we were both working in con-
nection with the original american legion
organized as you will remember by our
camp-fire later i lived for nearly a year
within about six inches of him without
either of us knowing it a new york apart-
ment house

  you may remember that the wilson ad-
ministration did everything it could to blot
out that american legion of ours-called
general leonard wood up on the carpet for
backing us up to the fullest extent he could
	adventure

called off the staff officers he had assigned for
almost full-time duty with us called oft
commander crank who was actively work-
ing with us for the navy and of course
refused all aid or sanction at a time when
the army did not have even the addresses
of the trained men it had discharged a
list of men trained in trades and professions
needed in war-time was apparently unheard
of i drew up one to the best of my poor
ability and several of general woods staff
at governors island took it and developed
it into something worth while i remember
that the idea was so untried in our army
that these officers to be sure of perfect
accuracy called in the non-coms to be sure
of such distinction as-i think i have it
right-the difference between blacksmith
and farrier the navy and marine officers
interested enlarged it to cover their arms of
the service

  our  members were cross-indexcd
according to their qualifications in that list
as well as to firing-line experience or fitness
when despite the active backing of ex-
presidents roosevelt and taft elihu root
three ex-secretaries of war and three of the
navy the steady opposition of the wilson
administration finally stopped the growth of
the legion it refused even to take over the
valuable records and indexes of our mem-
bership that valuable piece of machinery
-which general wood called the most
practical step up to that time taken for
national defense-had from the beginning
been placed at washingtons disposal if only
washington would use and develop it but
most all the big influence back of us could
accomplish was after the legion had ceased
active work and only after repeated efforts
to get the wilson administration to allow
us to file our invaluable records away in
some of their cellars or attics

  after we had leen drawn into the war
in the utterly unprepared condition the
legion had striven so hard to change i
learned by merest chance that our bureau
at washington had been working a hundred
or two clerks for months on the legion
records as a means of getting hold of men
for specialized needs and that three or four
other bureaus were wailing their turns
our legions work has proved a hundred
times worth doing but it would have proved
still a hundred times more valuable if wood-
row wilson and secretaries daniels baker
garrison et al had helped it to a natural

development during four precious years in-
stead of doing all they could to hinder it
we paid the price in american lives for our
unpreparedness the american legion
developed fully and in time could have
saved some of those lives probably even
as it was it saved some american lives by
advancing our preparations one little step
along the way

  the war taught washington its lesson
nowadays it does itself what once it would
not even allow citizens to do for it

  and when we went into the war colonel
evans then a captain assigned to duty in
new york remembered the legion phoned
me found its records were in washington
used by others and then asked for dupli-
cates they too were already in use but
werent there any records of any kind left
for the marine corps to work on well there
were the original applications of members
from which the records and indexes had been
made could he have than of course
and inside an hour a truck unloaded a
bunch of husky marines in our office and
away went those dusty bundles of applica-
tions filed in our office because there hadnt
been any other place for them

  yes camp-fire can be proud that its
own old american legion did serve the
country after all and that its name has been
handed over to the newer and greater organ-
ization

  and now im meeting colonel evans
again at camp-fire and glad to see him

   and a line concerning his story

naval war college newport rhode island

   as one of the latest recruits to report to the
camp-fire i am following custom with a few re-
marks after leaving princcton before my class
graduated in  due to a lack of coordination with
the faculty i served with co m st wisconsin in
the spanish war i then after having already put
in a year doing police work for the milwaukee sen-
tinel joined the staff of the old evening sun in new
york covering the cup races between the colum-
bia and shamrock running a football column cov-
ering police headquarters for three months and
general reporting i then entered the marine
corps as a sccond lieutenant in january 

a fter two and a half years at sea in the med-
itcrranean west indies and south atlantic
station i did a tour of one year in the philippines
and returned to the united states in time to sail for
panama in december  when we sent a brigade
there to protect panama after its secession from
columbia as the treaty required that the united
states keep the isthmus open for transit johnny
poe the old princeton star went down with us and
the camp-fire

he came back to regale princeton reunions with some
characteristic stories of his adventures with the
leathernecks in  i was retired for physical
disability but remained on duty for two years as
captain of the marine corps ritle team in 
i was a member of the palma rifle team which won
the palma trophy in canada and in  of the
american rille team which won the olympic
match at bisley england

  when the war broke out i managed to qualify for
return to the activc list and sersed with the sixth
marines over in france in   did a two-year
tour in haiti one of the fruits of which is my story
in this issue

  going back over my career i would say the high
spots of color were on the relief expedition to
martinique following the eruption of mt pele
when we were driven out of st pierre by a minor
eruption witnessing the famous marathon race of
the olympics in  belleau woods in june 
and an airplane flight that carried me over tortuga
island the famous pirate stronghold on the north
coast of haiti then over christophes famous cita-
del and his old palace at sans souci in may -
frank e evans colonel u s marine corps

t n  president simon sam of haiti fled the

  country after having looted the treasury gen-
eral firmin then controlled the revolutionary forces
in the south of haiti and in the north his rival
nord alexis was in control

  firmin had in command of his squadron of three
gunboats admiral killick a mulatto of english ex-
traction unusually well-educated forceful efficient
and courageous his flagship was the crete-d-
pierrol named after a famous battle between the
blacks and the french in 

  killick seized the hamburg american liner
marcomania which attempted to run guns through
gonaivcs to the rival revolutionary force in the
north he was ashore sick with fever in gonaives
when the german cruiser panther steamed in with
the ultimatum that the crelc-d-pierrot surrender
within an hour or be sunk killick dressed
boarded his gunboat dressed ship opened his
magazines and sent the crew ashore he had gone
out ready to fight but his captain had during his
sickness let the fires go out and he found himself
unable to steam or maneuver

  as the hour expired and the panthers landing
party formed on deck killick tossed a lighted cigar
into a magazine and the crete-d-pierrol blew up
historso was washed ashore clad in full-dress coat
and was buried in the place-d-armes with full
military honors on the spot where dessalines de-
clared haiti an independent nation on new years
day  that is the basis of the story-f e e

         in connection with his story
in this issue a few words from
percy charles chandler inci-
dentally the story gives a very
good picture of what a bull-fight is really
like

havana cuba

  as regards the the bullfight i have tried to
obtain the facts as they actually occurred-it hap-
pened some years after i had left gibraltar-but so



far my efforts have not met with success the
great war supervened and of all the men i knew
during my three years on the rock there is not
one left there now who can tell me about the cable-
man who fought the bulls in linea that this
actually did occur there is no doubt for many of my
colleagues have seen the matter referred to in the
newspapers they remember it as i myself do in
a casual way-p c chandler

at a january camp-fire h r
laudermilk asked the comrades
for an explanation of a phe-
nomenon he saw in sterling
colorado february  a beam as
from a searchlight ascended from every arc
and incandescent street light for several
hundred feet bright and distinct bluish
thin enough to see the stars through
two below zero on the street a slight breeze
from the northwest no clouds no moon
he had found no one who could explain or
had seen such lights elsewhere a num-
ber of comrades have written in

detroit michigan

   my experience with these lights is almost identi-
cal to that of mr laudermilk have seen them but
once and never heard of them before nor since

  it was in hardin montana about five years ago
i arose at about four one january morning to catch
an early train and beheld a spectacle identical to
that described by mr laudermilk from every
street light in town there was a beam of light about
a foot in diameter extending straight upward for a
distance of probably two hundred feet the tem-
perature was about ten below the sky clear and a
little frost flying in the air

  i have never heard any authentic explanation of
this phenomenon but i have an idea that it is prob-
ably caused by reflection from the frost in the air i
hope some one will come forward with the proper
dope on this question-r l asbury

chicoutimi p q canada

  wliile i am unable to explain the cause of these
shafts of light i have witnessed the same pheno-
menon on three different occasions twice last year
and once this in chicoutimi province of quebec
canada

  on the three occasions mentioned the temperature
was way below zero and there was a mist or fog-
j e ardron

pueblo colorado

  while i have never raised my voice in the camp-
fire previous to this time i take great interest in
what is said there

  i have spent a good portion of my life in sugar
city colorado and have witnessed this phenome-
non not once but literally dozens of times the
explanation seems to me to be very simple and i
think it will cover the case in question

  the beams may be seen whenever two conditions
arc fulfilled and these are a clear night and a coat
of snow the lights in all these small western
towns are equipped with shades that concentratc a
good part of the light on a point directly beneath and

mm
adventure



the snow acts as a reflector sending a beam like that
of a searchlight far up into the night sky

   it is a beautiful display and from outside of town
it looks like an anti-aircraft nest

  does this explain it mr laudermilk-hugo
rodeck

hibbing minnesota

  up here it is a very common sight in the winter
to sec the same tiling but it generally occurs when
the thermometer is around  to  below zero and
the air very still at such times above every arc
light in town a shaft of light about  feet high
perfectly straight and still and about the width of
the cover above the arc light reaches alove each
arc but in the town where the white way lights are
no such thing occurs only above the arcs at such
times when you get under the light the frost par-
ticles shine in the air like dust in a sunbeam in a
room in summer and if the moon is full or nearly
so there will be a cross with the moon in the
center and each side of the cross will lie as long and
of the same intensity as those extending above the
arc light but if a breeze springs up the lights above
the arcs disappear they dont fade but just go
out as if a switch were turned off

   these lights do not shine for just a few minutes
but shine all night providing the air is still and the
weather very cold and they go out when the gray
of dawn appears at such times when the sun
comes up two of these shafts of light will be seen one
on each side of the sun somewhere around  or 
feet on each side of it these are sun dogs

   i imagine the frost in the air is the cause of the
lights above the arcs and the cross on the moon and
the sun dogs too but i may be wrong and maybe
some of our camp-fire comrades can give us some
more information on it but as mr laudermilk
said he had never met any one who had seen the
phenomena  just had to write and tell him that it
is nothing new we see it so often that we pay no
attention to it but i cant say i have ever seen it
when it has been only  below zero because that
cant be called real cold weather and this only
occurs when it is real cold-george edwards

   p s when you get within a block of the arc the
light cannot be seen but at two blocks it is very
plain

regina sask canada

  this is a very common phenomenon in this part
of the world making a very pretty effect as we
have a large number of street lights it is especially
effective on the long straight streets with street
railway lines and lights down the center if one
stands in line it looks like one thick beam

  do hot know what causes this but my opinion is
this i have noticed that when the effect is at its
best the air is full of very fine particles of snow
this can plainly be seen around the lights the
manifestations usually occurred after a relatively
mild spell followed by sharp frost  to  below
zero i think is causcd by the moisture in the
upper air being frozen and falling as fine snow the
refraction causing the beams-edwin j bi-anciie

phe same phenomenon was witnessed by
jean clare of walkersville ontario
canada during the winter of  or 
at fort d a russell wyoming this
comrade enclosed a newspaper clipping

with a february  news despatch from
calgary describing the same phenomenon
as seen at that place the night before and
stating that weather experts attributed it
to the exceptional lightness of the air and
its total freedom from moisture-laden dust
particles

nphe fairly common occurence of the
phenomenon seems established but we
seem still to lack a final scientific explana-
tion will some of the weather scientists
among us give us the answer

a few weeks ago a w payne
of the department of middle
american research tulane uni-
versity wrote us for a copy of
mr colemans camp-fire talk on the ruins
of peten and later we received the following
interesting letter of thanks written from his
universitys honduras expedition in the
field i very particularly hope he will as
he says tell us more about the mayas
most of us know something of them but
nobody knows much and wed like to hear
from one of those who know most

  as one of us has recently challenged the
civilization of rome as inferior to those of
china carthage and india an examina-
tion into another old civilization is timely

puerto cortes honduras

     many thanks for your note of march  with
enclosed clipping of the letter to adventure for which
i asked i just happened down to the coast in
time to get the letter

r colemans letter is most interesting
but i would like to call to his attention the
extensive exploration and archeological study un-
dertaken in the maya area since  which prob-
ably has escaped him would refer him to the
publications of the peabody museum harvard
university the biologia centro americana the
archeology of which was the-work of mr alfred
maudslay of london publications of the carne-
gie institution of washington of the smithsonian
institution and of others

   the ruins of the formerly stupendous civilization
of the mayas which are found in northern honduras
northern and eastern guatemala yaeatan british
honduras and the southern states of mexico are
more than stupendous interesting amazing
or whatever terms you wish to apply the eng-
lish language lacks proper words to use this de-
partment was organized less than a year ago to
undertake further research i should say simply
research for despite the good work that has been
done in this area the amount of time applied has
never even scraped the surface of this field some
day americans of whatever nationality will wake
up to the fact that here we have an archeological
the camp-fire

field surpassing in many minds the interest and
possibly value of the various fields now being ex-
ploited and receiving press and public attention

  though less than a year old at this writing we
have three expeditions in the field one of explora-
tion entirely en route from lower vera cruz state
into guatemala yucatan and british honduras
the second botanical alone starting a two years
field program in the stale of tobasco mcxico i
am now in honduras making a rough preliminary
survey along various scientific lines to open the
way to bringing down a large party after the rainy
season of next fall

prom mr colemans brief description it is im-
possible to say just to which of the numerous
ruined maya cities he refers so far however i be-
lieve more than four hundred ruin sites have been
put on the map of guatemala and yucatan and
as he says some of these and near the pcten region
also far overshadow the ruined cities of copan
quirigua and palcnque the former is in north-
eastern honduras the second in southeastern
guatemala the third in the state of chiapas
mexico not very far from guatemala

   as to this being an uninhabited country it can be
said that many descendants of the formerly great
maya empire now live there but have been so op-
pressed by centurics of white men they wisely fight
shy of the latter their huts gathered in towns of
a half dozen at the very most are hard to find
when found the inhabitants iorcwarned have
usually taken to the bush until the disturbers shall
have left but few white men have met and held
converse with them

   i would lie inclined to scout the reports of finds
of old skulls with teeth inlaid with diamonds will
say however tliat in the maya area teeth have
been found incisors with inlaid jade or jadeite discs
the skill with which this was accomplished was
marvelous moreover dentists of the present day
who have examined these few finds declare the
most marvelous thing is that the teeth did not de-
cay they have said that should a modern dentist
try such a thing the teeth would decay and the
discs fall out yet the mayas had neither iron nor
steel with which to make instruments for this work

wiiile this department is to undertake all
manner of research work in the countries
from texas to colombia archeology is to the lay

mind of course the most interesting section some
day id like to find time to tell adventures readers
something of the mayas who long preceded the
aztecs also most likely the original peruvians and
bolivians whom we are now incorrectly wont to call
the incas who arc credited with the possibility of
being the first discoverers of the zero and placc-
value-position in mathematics without which the
latter can not exist who were such great astrono-
mers as to have perfected a calendar at least a
thousand years before christ which was better and
more exact than any used in the world at the time of
the conquest when the maya empire bad long
fallen into decay and practically vanished as such
who were very likely the devisers of poured con-
cretc construction using a lime mortar in place of
cement as their temple and pakice ruins still show
whose chief religious city was a mecca to which
flocked pilgrims from as far south as panama at
least and as far north as the states as objects
found in a sacrificial well at this city now called



chichen itza show who were engineers theolo-
gians experts at government artists architects
road builders painters and exceptionally skilled in
medicine to list but a few of their attainments
and finally whose origin and dates are shrouded in
impenetrable mystery and whose highly developed
system of hieroglyphic writing is still unreadable
and has stumped many fine brains

  is it any wonder that one waxes so ravingly en-
thusiastic over such ancients as to so unduly pro-
long a short letter of thanks

what about the maps we run
along with such of our stories as
seem to profit by them in clear-
ness and interest they had as
a general idea the strong approval of all of
you who voiced opinion but here in the office
weve been debating several questions con-
cerning them and you the readers are the
only ones who can settle those questions
well be glad if youll tell us how you feel
about them

 shall we use more of them or fewer
sometimes the names on the maps havent
seemed to us sufficiently legible shall we
lake enough more space for the maps to
make all details clearer where are they
most needed and welcome-with historical
stories or with ordinary stories whose geo-
graphical details are determined by the au-
thor alone which do you like better-
maps showing the location of the stories in
relation to the rest of the world or maps of
some particular part in which much of the
story centers

  of course its difficult to generalize since
each story is more or less a case in itself but
well be glad to have any and all opinions
that will guide us in making the maps suit
the greatest possible number of you-ash

  reply by mr whileaker-there arc several
kinds of filters that arc used to purify water the
water in the oil field is in most cases drinkable with-
out being filtered the oil wells usually are from
about  to  feet deep some of these wells
are ruined by salt water seeping into them the
wells that furnish the drinking water in these com-
munities arc very seldom over one hundred and
fifty feet deep so do not come in contact with
the petroleum or crude oil except where the water
well and the oil well are very close to each other

  a simple water filter for domestic purposes is
sometimes made by slutting a piece ol sponge in the
bottom of a funnel or the hole of a flower pot and

then placing above this a layer of smooth stones
then a layer of coarsc sand and above this a layer of
pounded charcoal three or four inches thick an-
other layer of pebbles should be placed above the
charcoal to prevent it from being stirred up when
the water is poured in this filter requires occa-
sional cleaning by the replacement of the charcoal

  another method consists of a couple of flower
pots one above the other the lower one is fitted
with the sponge and filtering layers above described
and the upper one with a sponge only the upper
one should be the larger the lower one the stronger
so as to hold the upper pot the two pots thus
arranged are placed upon a three-legged stool with
a hole in it through which the projecting part of the
lower sponge passes and the water drops into a jug
placed below the upper pot serves as a reservoir
and its sponge stops the coarser impurities and thus
the filtering layers of the lower one may be used for
two or three years without being renewed if the top
sponge be occasionally cleaned

first aid in the tropics

how to keep healthy in the jungle

  request-i intend to prospect around in some
latin-amcrican countries and would like to know
what to take along in my lirst-aid outfit and how to
use it especially remedies against fevers disentery
and snake-bites if you know some books on this
subject will you kindly recommend them to me-
george swncis detroit mich

  reply by dr fordyce-i am sending you here-
with a copy of my booklet on taking the place of
the doctor which gives you general ideas on first-
aid and outfits for tropical use i would add a
a quantity of quinine in -grain capsules and some
of the sun cholera tablets

  ordinary care of health the purification of all
drinking water protection against insects which
carry disease and proper clothing is all that is
needed but nowhere is strict attention to hygiene
and disease prevention so necessary as in the tropics
and the penalty is always at hand for neglect
things which affect disease especially in the tropics
are sunlight humidity insects impure food and
water

  tropical sunlight is more potent than in temper-
ate zones not alone because the perpendicular rays
make the intervening protective layer of atmosphere
relatively thinner but also because this results in
greater intensity of illumination in any exposed
area

  it was long thought that actinic rays which arc
chemically active were the only ones which do harm
but in reality the most harm comes from the long
heat waves than the short actinic waves so keep out
of the sun as much as possible from  to  oclock
do little work the-natives take their siestas
around noon when the sun rays are the strongest
if living in a tent have an extra fly over it to help to
keep the suns rays out smoked or neutral tinted
glasses help against the intensity of light and if one
must be in the sun the helmet and spinc-pad arc
necessary the sun helmet should be of cork not
pith-which melts in a rain-and should have double
tcrai

  the helmet is a wide felt and then another wide
felt hat on top of that the vertical rays of the sun
get lost between the two hats the spine-pad is
a quilted affair like a flat-iron lifter on the outside
is brown flannel and inside a gaudy orange-colored
fabric to intercept the actinic rays it is eight to
ten inches wide and shaped to button down the
back wear a silk handerchicf about the neck as
the spine and back of the neck arc the most vulner-
able to the sun

while the sunlight has a great deal to do with
the maintenance of health in the tropics yet
there is another factor-humidity a temperature
of  degrees is not so exhausting but along the
coast where one sweats in streams at  or  de-

grees it is most depressing in the highlands the
nights arc cold down to  degrees at  feet
altitude with a noon temperature of  degrees
acclimization is undoubtedly obtainable by healthy
whites from the temperate zones in the tropics but
colonization of lowlands with much humidity by a
white race is regarded as impossible by all modem
authorities

  one more thing in the way of equipment i wish
to call attention to in considering the maintenance
of health in the tropics and that is the so-called
cholera belt which is merely a woolen band worn
about the abdomen at night to prevent chill chills
in the temperate zones result usually in no more
than a coryza or cold in the head but in the tropics
-look out-it means intestinal troubles

   practically all of the fevers in the tropics are in-
troduced into the human body through food or the
bites of insects foods should be cooked all water
should be boiled furiously for five minutes and then
cooled in a felt-covered canteen or desert water-bag
in a breeze or it can be rendered safe by chemical
means by using the halazonc tablets mentioned in
the first-aid booklet for protection against mos-
quitoes or flics have your tent or house screened with
cloth or wire  to  meshes to the inch if on the
trail a head net is desirable and some people like to
use the repellants such as bamber oil composed of
oil of citrorfella one and one-half parts kerosene one
part and coconut oil two parts

attention to a well-balanced diet is needed

    beri-beri for example is due to a deficiency in
vitamines so to offset it we eat yeast dal and alia
and fresh vegetables and avoid polished rice
some people do nothing in the way of drug taking
to prevent malaria when in a known malarial coun-
try but rely on prevention of mosquito bites and if
they do get the disease then they begin active treat-
ment others take the quinine preventative con-
sisting of  to  grains once daily in the evening
an hour before dusk and on a full stomach which is
protective within a limited period

  one should take a hot bath daily and never sleep
on the ground-the air mattress is good or use a
cot or hammock the lightest jaegar wool under-
wear is essential to prevent chill in the shade or in
the breeze or at dusk for diarrhea the well-known
sun cholera tablets should b in travelers kit

could get several pounds of the raw material

  any information you can give me about turquoise
will be appreciated very much if this letter is sent
to adventure please withhold my name

  thank you a thousand times for any bother i may
cause---
ask adventure



reply by mr harriman-nevada mines mighty
little turquoise according to lapidaries who are
among my friends the main supply among jewel-
ers here comes from mineral park arizona a few
miles east of chloride tiffany of new york city
has a mine near silver city new mexico from
which be takes a supply now and then closing the
mine between bites as it were he may not tajce
out any turquoise for several years

  i have no means of knowing what value is placed
upon turquoise mines of nevada but venture the
assertion that no wholesaler would make any very
large offer for one

  the southwest gem  jewelry co  west th
street los angeles handles turquoise the price
per pound runs from  to  the quality
most used is that for which they ask from s to
