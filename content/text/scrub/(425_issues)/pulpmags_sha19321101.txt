enjoy better health

in your mouth-in every normal mouth-
millions of bacteria breed among them
are frequently found the dangerous germs
associated with colds catarrh and sore
throat

  your common sense tells you that the
cleaner you keep the surfaces of your mouth
and the more bacteria you kill the less
the danger of infection

  twice-a-day gargling with listerine is a
simple pleasant formula for maintaining oral
health

  the moment listerine enters the mouth it
begins to kill germs when the liquid is ex-
pelled after gargling it carries with it millions

of bacteria swept from mouth and throat
surfaces

  remember that although it kills germs full
strength listerine is pleasant and safe in
action contrast its safe action with that of
untried mouth washes so harsh they damage
delicate membranes

the five chameleons

from the private annals of the shadow

as told to

maxwell grant

the reply came in a mocking whis-
per from unseen lips a cold pause
followed then the sinister voice re-
peated its taunting statement

i am the shadow i bring you
doom hawk forster

the cornered crook could only stare
in terror hawk was facing the
shadow dread avenger whose name

chapter i

a squealer dies

the shadow

 the hoarse frightened cry came from
 a man who cowered beside the wall of
 the little room his beady blinking
 eyes were staring wildly at a tall form
 clad in black

 yes i am the shadow
 shad-a


the shadow magazine

brought fear to the hordes of the un-
derworld-even to the overlords of
crime

  to such rats as hawk forster a
meeting with the shadow occurred only
once in a lifetime the cringing gang-
ster knew the verdict that now awaited
him

  death

  the shadow tall and mysterious
garbed in black cloak and slouch hat
was a stern inexorable figure his
countenance was obscured by the up-
turned collar of his cloak and the tilt-
ing slope of his dark hat

  hawk forster blinking nervously
could see only the glow of two pene-
trating eyes that shone from unfathom-
able depths those eyes were the sign
of doom

  a single arm extended from the folds
of the black cloak the gloved hand
held an automatic the muzzle of the
gun was trained upon the huddled gang-
ster

  the setting of this strange scene was
the squalid room of an old hotel an
open bag upon the floor showed that the
gangster had been about to leave a
doorlike window with the dim rail of a
small balcony beyond showed the path
by which the shadow had entered to
surprise the fleeing man

  you fear death the shadows
voice was ironic you killed two men
in cold blood but you fear death your-
self so i shall let you live-the sud-
den hope that came in forsters eyes
ended with the next words-for a little
while

  the crook chewed his puffy lips his
face had turned white plis eyes were
pleading

  the shadow laughed again-the same
sardonic laugh that had announced his
presence here

  murderer though you are he de-
clared you have a cowards heart
three nights ago you killed two men

and fled you were recognized the
police have been searching for you
they could not find you

  but i the shadow learned where
you were hiding now the police have
learned of this place they are on their
way here soon they will arrive
hawk threw a frightened glance to-
ward the heavy door it was his only
way of escape yet he dared not move

  the shadow laughed the plight of
this trapped killer pleased him

  but unfortunately resumed the
shadow the police do not move as
swiftly as the shadow knowing that
you might be planning an escape i came
here to hold you for them cowards
such as you do not belong to the
shadow so you may live-with one
goal the electric chair at sing sing
no no gasped hawk no

let me go ill-

  his words were interrupted by
sounds from the hallway outside the
room a heavy fist pounded on the
strong door hawk forster knelt in
quaking silence

  open in the name of the law came
through the door

  the muffled command went un-
heeded hawk forster shuddered as he
crouched against the wall afraid to
move the shadow silent as a statue
made no attempt to force him

  sharp blows resounded hawk for-
ster turned his face toward the door
he could see the stout wood quiver
from each blow again he faced the
shadow in the center of the room

  hawks pasty face was pitiful he
knew that he could expect no mercy
from the shadow yet he held one fur-
tive hope

  let me go he pleaded if you
do ill tell yes ill tell what even
you dont know ill give you the lay

on the biggest game-

  he stopped as the shadow laughed
the menacing automatic seemed en-
dowed with life as it moved slowly for-
the shadow magazine



ward the flowing eyes were livid
hawk forster was learning the menace
of the shadow to the full

  to the shadow hawk forster was
just another rat of the underworld
time and again the shadow had
trapped creatures of his ilk they al-
ways pleaded for mercy-offered to
squeal to barter with the shadow to
save their own worthless skins the
shadow had a way of dealing with
them

  you will squeal his voice was
a harsh weird whisper squeal then
tell me what you know that i do not
know speak 

  the words were a command they
offered no conditions the shadows
voice meant doom with no escape

  hawk forster knew it but his fear
of the shadow made him speak
against his will he squealed while the
battering at the door continued its
mighty tattoo

  its a big game gasped hawk
theyve been layin low until it was
ripe now its all set but before they
start theres one guy thats due to get
his r
be quick

  the shadows command was terse
and low as hawk paused to lick his thick
lips and stare in terror toward the
slowly yielding door

  dan antrim-forster was gasping
what he knew-dan antrim the law-
yer hes crooked mixed up with the
racket hes a double-crosser thats
why hes goin to get his its cornin

from a guy that he thinks is-

  the words became a terrified squeal
as the cowardly gangster saw the door
bulge inward under the impact of a
mighty smash hawk threw his arms
before his face the shadows left
hand struck them down his burning
eyes were close to hawks hideous dis-
torted countenance

  who is after antrim 

  ill tell you cried hawk a guy

i used to know-long ago hes given
me the lay hes cornin here-to new
york-to get-

  before the miserable man could con-
tinue the door was lifted bodily from
its hinges and hurled into the room it
had yielded unexpectedly as it fell
two men sprawled headlong upon it

  the shadow never forgetting his
purpose here moved swiftly and si-
lently in three long rapid strides he
was by the window there he turned
for one quick parting glance

  hawk forster was pouncing for-
ward the shadow saw the reason in
front of one of the men who was clam-
bering from the flattened door lay a
gleaming revolver

  the rising man was detective joe
cardona ace of the new york force
his gun had shot from his grasp when
he plunged in with the door

  that revolver meant salvation for
hawk forster the inrush of the po-
lice had ended the shadows oppor-
tunity to hear what hawk knew now
the menacing figure had departed and
hawk saw his chance to thwart the men
who sought to capture him

  hawks clawing fingers closed upon
the revolver up came the weapon be-
fore cardona could reach it with a
futile clutch the second detective was
raising his gun too late hawks finger
was on the trigger of the revolver the
gangsters puffy lips were snarling their
triumph

  as hawks finger moved a shot re-
sounded it did not come from the gun
that the murderer had grabbed in-
stead the report issued from the bal-
cony outside the window

  the shadows automatic had spoken
hawks last chance was gone the re-
volver dropped from his hand as the
shadows bullet shattered his wrist for
a split second the men  the floor
formed an unmoving tableau

  hawk forster was staring at his use-


the shadow magazine

less hand joe cardona was sprawled
forward at the end of a hopeless effort
to seize the gangsters arm the sec-
ond detective was stupefied as he rested
on one knee none noticed the curl of
smoke that weaved inward from the
opened window

  hawk was the first to act despite his
bewilderment he shot out his left
hand to seize the gun cardona was
wriggling sidewise to gain the weapon
the other detective had his opportunity
and used it he fired twice over car-
donas back

  hawks mad spring ended in a twist-
ing slump the rat-faced gangster fell
sidelong and rolled upon his back his
bulging eyes must have fancied that they
again saw the black-clad figure of the
shadow for terror came over hawks
face as he coughed out inarticulate
words

  cardona heard the utterances but
could not understand them he did not
know that the dying man was trying to
complete an interrupted statement that
hawk forster on the rim of the be-
yond was squealing then the eyes
closed the rat-faced gunman was
dead

  joe cardona his revolver regained
scrambled to his feet and looked about
the room his companion sprang for-
ward to look at the dead man

  where did that shot come from
growled cardona somebody clipped
him right when we needed it most
wasnt any of us--

  he paused as his gaze took in the
opened window cardona motioned his
companion back toward the doorway
while he himself slipped along the wall
and approached the blackened casement

  true the single shot had saved car-
donas life but had the man who fired
it intended to aid the detective or hin-
der him cardona had seen shots like
that go astray through strange twists
of luck

  while his brother officer now wary

covered the window cardona stepped
boldly to the balcony all appeared
dark outside deep fog blanketed the
street

  peering down into the gloom car-
dona made out a balcony on the floor
below then there was a drop to the
street a swift agile man could have
escaped that way

  through the fog a street lamp
showed the sidewalk below the bal-
cony a uniformed policeman dashed
into the lamplight staring upward evi-
dently he had been attracted by the
sound of the gunfire

  cardona shouted down to him the
patrolman recognized the brusque voice
of the detective the most widely known
of all headquarters men

  any one down there demanded
cardona

  no came the officers reply

  look under the balcony

  no one there

  send for the wagon then weve
got a dead one up here

  the policeman hurried away toward
the patrol box at the corner cardona
peered downward then shrugged his
shoulders and went back to look at the
body of hawk forster

  in the patch of light upon the side-
walk a splotch of blackness appeared
it wavered there while a man emerged
from a spot beside the dark wall of the
old hotel	

  the darkness disappeared as a tall
form flitted across the street and merged
with the misty light through the thick-
ness of the fog resounded the tones of
a weird chilling laugh

  joe cardona viewing the body from
the window heard that laugh it awak-
ened a responsive chord in the detec-
tives mind his forehead furrowed as
he caught the faint echoes of sinister
mirth

  the laugh of the shadow

  cardona knew that laugh it had
the shadow magazine



come to his ears at other times when
he had been miraculously saved from
death at the hands of evildoers to
cardona the weird merriment brought
enlightenment

 he knew now that he had been
brought here by the shadow he
knew the source of the telephone call
that had told him where hawk forster
wanted murderer could be found

  a quiet voice had spoken to cardona
over the phone-not the voice of the
shadow but cardona had cause to
believe that the avenger of crime em-
ployed trusted subordinates

  the shadow he had spotted cap-
tured and thwarted hawk forster the
killer jt was one more token of the
shadows relentless war against crime
another blow struck in the cause of
justice joe cardona understood and
thought that he knew all

  cardona was wrong he did not
know that hawk forster was a rat who
had tried to squeal that the murderer
had known the schemes of more potent
crooks and had been about to blab
them to the shadow when the detec-
tives made their premature entrance

  cardona suspected nothing only
the shadow knew that some great
crime was brewing yet he had gained
only an inkling from hawk forster
before circumstances had forced him to
make a rapid exit

  danger threatened daniel antrim a
lawyer who dealt with criminals when
that danger struck it would mark the
beginning of rampant crime

  vile plans were under way with
hawk forster dead none but the
schemers themselves knew what the
details were

  only the shadow could meet these
enemies of the law to do so he must
learn both source and nature of the con-
templated crime which hawk forsters
sealed lips could never tell

  could the shadow uncover the plot
wherever it might be brewing

chapter ii

man with a mission

  the trim yacht vesta was plowing
smoothly through the mild blue waters
of the gulf stream upon the rear
deck beneath a widespread canopy sat
four men dressed in suits of cool
pongee

  glasses clinked in their hands often
their conversation was broken with ri-
bald laughter the four appeared a
typical group of pleasure-seekers with
nothing more to do than enjoy to the
fullest the luxurious life of tropical
seas

  there was a definite ease of equality
about these men each seemed to pos-
sess poise and leadership in action
manner and deportment they were
much alike yet in facial appearance
and physical proportions there were no-
ticeable differences

  the difference became particularly
evident during a peculiar ceremony
which the men performed they were
drinking to the health of each in turn
-apparently a regular procedure one
man would keep to his seat as the other
three stood and lifted their glasses

  to george ellsworth those drink-
ing the toast first recited in unison the
best of luck and health

  they drank and sat down plopping
their empty glasses before the man
whom they had toasted

  fill them up butcher fill them
up

  the one called george ellsworth com-
plied his manner was characteristic of
his nickname butcher he was a
big bluff fellow some forty odd years
of age his face was full his lips
jocular his fat beefy hand gripped
the bottle and filled the glasses

  then ellsworth rose and two others
got to their feet with him the fourth
of the group remained seated

  to howard best came the chant
the best of luck and health


the shadow magazine

  down went the drinks down plopped
the glasses

  your turn to fill them deacon said
butcher

  solemn-faced and taciturn howard
best silently filled the glasses his white
scrawny hands tense he was the so-
ber-miened member of the group the
sobriquet of deacon fitted him like a
slipper he appeared years older than
butcher standing next to the huge
man deacon looked very lean and with-
ered

  to maurice exton the best of luck
and health 

  thus chimed the third toast and
after it the jocular order

  pour it out major dont be stingy
with the bottle

  maurice exton-the one called ma-
jor-was a medium-sized man in his
late thirties his hair was black his
features sallow a neat mustache that
matched his hair adorned his upper lip
a vandyke tipped his chin his
shoulders were erect and had a mili-
tary bearing he filled the glasses with
steady hands

  then came the toast to the fourth
of the group

  to joel hawkins the best of luck
and health

  after the passing of this last toast
there was momentary silence

  then deacon turned to joel hawkins
and said

  dont forget the glasses ferret
theres another one coming up

  thats right replied ferret with
a wry grin did you think i forgot
joel hawkins leaned forward with a
shrewd gleaming grin short stoop-
shouldered so as to almost appear de-
formed the name of ferret was apt
the mans eyes peered sharply through
partly closed lids handling the bottle
with his face on a level with the glasses
he seemed to be measuring each drink
so that all would be exactly the same
major picked up his glass and stood

while the other three followed him to
their feet

  to david traver he said in an
even voice

  to david traver came the chorus
the best of luck and health

  the men drank this final toast more
slowly their glasses swung down one
by one

  as they resumed their seats they
looked about with satisfaction

  well weve remembered judge
declared butcher

  judge has remembered us said
deacon quietly

  the conversation took a new turn
now that the strange formality had
reached its end

  new york in the morning the end
of the trail announced butcher with
a broad smile all on deck at seven
we want to take a look at the statue
of liberty

  let the old gal take a look at us
cackled ferret

  its all the same to me said major
what im thinking about is the few
bottles that we might carry in judge
would appreciate hearing our toast
when we see him

  deacons the boy to lug in the grog
said ferret cunningly he could pack
it under his coat theres plenty of
room around that spindle shape of his
lend him one of your coats butcher
why worry about it questioned
butcher like enough judge will have
a houseload of booze in over the
canadian border no use monkeying
with the custom men if we can help it
theres sense in that declared
major you know i dont like to take
foolish chances there are enough big
ones it was a great load off my mind
when we spotted that plane off the
florida coast the crew figured we
sent in our full liquor supply then
theyve been educated to it ob-
served deacon
the shadow magazine



  the important thing now resumed
major is to split up after we land
handshakes at the dock the best of
luck-for the future

  and no tears from you deacon
said butcher i thought you were
going to bust out crying when we made
that overboard heave down in the carib-
bean--

  forget it butcher growled ma-
jor forget it deacon has forgot-
ten it that reminds me ferret-
youre the one that has some forgetting
to do

  major is right ferret seconded
deacon

  that letter writing-major shook
his head in disapproval-it wasnt
right ferret

  but hawk was a pal of mine pro-
tested ferret looking around the group
he wouldnt squawk anyway i only
told him-

  we talked that over before said
major well drop it now im think-
ing of to-morrow ill get you a time-
table ferret as soon as we reach new
york the first train out of the big
town will be the best we want you
to drop in on judge ahead of the rest
of us

  all right returned ferret in an
annoyed tone leave it to me
major

  ill leave it to you major spoke
emphatically but remember youre
one in five the interests of the gang
come first you may have some idea
of your own get it out of your head
-until afterward therell be plenty of
time later on were all going to be
independent after a while

  remember it echoed deacon star-
ing solemnly at ferret

  butcher chimed in with a warning
growl

  that ended the discussion butcher
chewing the end of a havana cigar
called for the steward and another
bottle was brought to the table after-

ward came dinner then an ocean eve-
ning that ended with the men tottering
singly to their cabins

  faces were weary and solemn when
the men gathered in the morning as
the vesta nosed her way through the
outer harbor standing by the rail the
four watched the outgoing liners and
stared toward the staten island shore

  butcher seemed half groggy and less
jocular than usual deacon was quiet
and silent but that was not unusual
major said very little but bore himself
with the poise of a veteran ferret was
the quietest of all yet his glance was
furtive and his manner restless

  with various delays in order it was
late in the afternoon when the vesta
had finally docked and the four men
had passed the customs officials ashore
the departing passengers shook hands
with the stern-faced captain of the
yacht the vesta was due to clear for
another port within a few days

  deacon entered a taxicab alone
butcher drove off in another major
and ferret remained the latter grinning
as he loooked along the avenue that
bordered the water front major left
him for a moment to return with a
time-table

  your train leaves grand central at
midnight he said ive marked it
here telephoned a reservation for
you go get some dinner take in a
show but be sure you pull out on the
whirlwind limited jet me

  i get you answered ferret with a
grin so long major ill be seeing
you later

  ferret stepped into a cab and rolled
away he went directly to the grand
central station there he picked up
his railroad and sleeper tickets he fol-
lowed majors advice about obtaining
dinner but afterward ferret went to
a telephone booth and consulted the
manhattan directory

  his first finger ran along one of


the shadow magazine

the front pages of the book it stopped
at the name of antrim ferret noted
the address he closed the book and
his eyes gleamed wickedly he had
found his entertainment for that night

   major was right there were five of
them the predominant interest of
the five was a common interest but
ferret-more than any of the others-
had an interest of his own he did not
intend to let it pass the others would
never know

  there was plenty of time remaining
before midnight a stroll on broad-
way first then he could take the path
he wanted leave it to luck if luck
came his way he would meet it

  thus it was that shortly after ten
oclock ferret hands in pocket ap-
peared on a street some blocks north of
forty-second street sauntering toward
the apartment where daniel antrim
made his home

chapter iii

ferret talks business

   beneath the light of a street lamp
ferret stopped and reached into his in-
side pocket he drew forth a crum-
pled envelope from this he extracted
a much-creased letter

  the note as ferret opened it re-
vealed a crude scrawl with a roughly
traced diagram in the center of the
page ferrets avid eyes swept through
the writing as though they were merely
refreshing themselves with knowledge
that was already deeply embedded in the
mans memory

  the letter was the work of a man
who could spell but crudely ferret a
quick keen reader touched important
statements with his finger tip and
smiled cruelly as he read them

   i have bin watching a sins you wised
me up about him  i got into his plac
whil he was out one nite    this
drawing showes the lay  in the desk
he kips the dop on the gys he is dubbel-

    crosing    solly bricker    centter
     keeping mum becuz of what
 you rote    phony key behynd haul
  raddiater   	hawk

   the final word formed the signature
ferret digested every statement in the
letter he paid particular attention to
the diagram which bore such marks as
big room back door raddiater
and desk

   then ferret tore the letter into tiny
fragments he strolled on through the
dark and tossed the pieces to the breeze
they fluttered away in all directions

   sneaking craftily ferret reached the
front door of an old apartment build-
ing the inner lobby was dimly lighted
he entered and turned toward a flight
of stairs at the left ascending to the
third floor

   at the end of the hall were two doors
-one at the corner on the left the
other on the right but a dozen feet
from the corner

   there was a light beaming through
the glass transom of the doorway on the
left ferret grinned

   he stared suspiciously at the door
on the right the transom above it was
black that was sufficient

   ferret looked back along the gloomy
hall seeing no one he advanced to a
radiator at the extreme end of the
hall he stooped and fished beneath
the radiator a key glimmered in his
hand

   ferret was looking intently at the
key he did not observe the white face
pressed against the transom at the right
some one was watching him but fer-
ret did not know it silently the stoop-
shouldered man unlocked the door at the
left and entered

  he was very cautious now-more
stealthy than he had been in the hall
where his footfalls left a slight sound
he was peering into a lighted room
from a small entry in the far corner
he observed a stout bald-headed man
seated at a desk
the shadow magazine



  ferrets lips curled in hatred as he
noiselessly closed the door behind him
from his hip pocket he drew a short
stub-nosed revolver

  he crept forward like a preying cat
until he was no more than six feet away
from the bald-headed man then a
sneering chuckle came from ferret

  the stout man whirled quickly in his
swivel chair his red bloated face be-
came a livid purple his body trem-
bled his bulging startled eyes caught
the upward nudge of ferrets revolver
instinctively he raised his arms

  ferret cold-eyed harsh-faced and
unmasked stared directly at his quarry
the venomous hate in his eyes did not
seem to impress daniel antrim

  the lawyer stared back at ferret
wonderingly evidently he did not
recognize the man who was threatening
him

  what do you want he demanded
suddenly

  i want to talk to you growled fer-
ret with a leer

  who are you questioned antrim

  the reply was an outburst of cackling
laughter

  who am i quizzed ferret did
you ever hear of a man named joel
hawkins

  antrim shook his head slowly

  well thats who i am joel hawk-
ins  ferrets laugh was frigid and
youre dan antrim the lawyer the
double-crosser

  a startled look came over antrim
for a moment he trembled then he
became steadier and assumed the air of
a man who is ready to play out a des-
perate bluff

  youre wrong he said all
wrong youre mixed up lets take
this easy now put down that gun-

  and let you pull another double
cross nix

  i never double-crossed anybody
in-

  you never did different growled
ferret

  he gave a forward thrust with his
arm and shoved the gun almost against
antrims ribs

  slide back that chair ferret or-
dered ill show you the goods thats
what ill do

  covering antrim who was pushing
himself away from the desk with his
feet ferret yanked at the bottom
drawer of the desk it jerked open
and ferret pulled out a stack of papers
he did this mechanically watching an-
trim as he worked

  with quick short glances toward the
contents of the drawer ferret found the
envelope he sought it was marked with
the name of bricker

  with one dexterous hand ferret
shook some folded papers from the en-
velope he gave a swift look at them
then gazed suddenly at daniel antrim

  the expression on the lawyers face
told everything ferret had not had
time to notice what was on the papers
but antrims unrestrained fear showed
that he knew his bluff had failed fer-
ret chuckled

  i dont have to look any more he
declared i know youre a double-
crosser youve pulled it on a lot of
people theres one thing im not go-
ing to tell you just yet-that is how i
found out wait until you hear

  his voice trailed into another laugh
he lifted the receiver from the hook
of the telephone on the desk with his
gun elbow on the top of the mouth-
piece ferret dialed a number with his
left hand

  antrim wild-eyed was watching
trying to learn the number that ferret
was calling

 who-who- he began in a

stutter

  im calling a fellow who has a lot
to learn declared ferret hell find
it out-now


the shadow magazine

  his eyes were gleaming with a men-
ace that made antrim remain unprotest-
ing a query came over the wire fer-
ret spoke

 that you solly    good
   listen im giving you a
straight lay    dan antrim is
double-crossing you    yes the
lawyer you thought he was ok
well he isnt

his desk    youll be just in time
to see him get whats due him   
im going to plug him but he wont be
dead ill leave the second shot for
you dont forget to grab the stuff you
find 

  ferret was listening shrewdly he
heard an excited oath across the wire
he hung up the telephone

  solly is convinced he said to an-
trim with a grin hes coming here
when he gets here its curtains for you
dan antrim

  ill make it worth while gasped
the lawyer lay off this let me

go ill pay you-

  pay me

  ferrets cold tone was intense with
hate he shoved his body close to the
lawyers form and snarled a terse mes-
sage into daniel antrims ear a look
of complete stupefaction spread over
the lawyers face ferret stepped back
leering

  you get it now

 you-you-- gasped antrim

  yes grinned ferret you didnt
figure i would be around did you
well youll never know how i got
here

  he stepped across the room and
waited covering antrim from the
farther door

  all im going to do is plug you
once he said still grinning then

ill leave you for solly you and the
papers on the desk

  that back door of yours is going to
make a nice way out for me antrim
i unlatched the front when i came in
solly wont have any trouble none at
all none at all

  the two men were motionless now
antrim slumped was breathing heav-
ily ferret leering wore a fixed ex-
pression on his crafty face it was a
a strange scene-especially when viewed
from the transom of the apartment
door

  for there a man was peering with
one foot poised on the radiator his op-
posite hand clinging to the side of the
doorway this man looking from the
hallway had silently witnessed each
move in ferrets trapping of daniel
antrim

  the peering man serious-faced and
broad-shouldered dropped from his
perch with the lightness of a cat and
stood an instant in the hallway he
turned and crossed to the half-opened
door on the other side he hastened
into a dark apartment and closed the
door a few moments later he was at
a telephone

  a quiet voice answered him it spoke
only a single work that word was a
name

  burbank

  vincent calling declared the man
at the telephone in a low tense tone
man in antrims apartment cover-
ing him with gun has telephoned
evidently expecting some one else
stand by call in three minutes
harry vincent agent of the
shadow stood by in the darkness i le
had been stationed here to watch de-
velopments at daniel antrims the
man to whom he had just spoken was
burbank harry knew while he
waited that burbank was communicat-
ing his message to the shadow

  he called the number again once
the shadow magazine



more came the quiet voice of burbank
this time it carried an order

  prevent action by antrims enemy
hold him there

  that was all quickly harry hung
up the telephone and slipped from his
darkened apartment he approached
antrims door and carefully turned the
knob the door yielded

  harry had not waited to take another
look through the transom he held an
automatic firmly in his right hand
pointing it through the narrow opening
of the door he saw the positions of
the two men virtually unchanged

  ferret gloating had his eyes on an-
trim the lawyer was staring at the
man who covered him

  it was a tense moment for harry
vincent but he had experienced more
difficult ones in the service of the
shadow his course was plain and he
followed it

  stepping into the entryway he let
the door swing easily behind him it
stopped before it was fully closed
without waiting for the noise to be no-
ticed harry spoke in a brusque deter-
mined tone

  drop that gun he ordered one
move and youre dead

  ferret knew the words were meant
for him he knew too much to let
them pass unheeded his hand did not
move as his eyes turned to note the
automatic in harry vincents hand

  ferrets fingers unclosed mechan-
ically his own revolver clattered on
the floor

  turn this way commanded harry
hands up back against the wall
ferrets gloating turned to a hunted
furtive glance sullenly he did as he
was told he stared straight into the
barrel of harrys automatic

  daniel antrim recovering his wits
arose slowly and approached his desk
harry did not stop him antrim fum-
bling in a drawer was hunting for his
gun

  harrys firm unyielding method did
not allow ferret a single inch of lee-
way but as harry watched he noticed
something that suddenly brought uncer-
tainty ferrets furtive eyes were
changing the lids half closed and the
pupils gleamed through the narrowed
slits

  it was startling that this should hap-
pen when harry held him helpless and
antrim was also rising as an enemy it
came as an instant warning to the man
at the door

  in a twinkling harry saw that an-
trim was producing- a revolver ferret
could be his quarry now harry knew
that danger had arrived

  pie swung instantly toward the door
behind him as he did a huge hand
caught his wrist and wrenched it down-
ward an arm already swinging
brought the barrel of a revolver flash-
ing toward his head

  harrys instinctive dodge diverted the
terrific blow its intent was to crack his
skull instead it clipped the side of
his neck

  that was sufficient harrys auto-
matic fell from his nerveless fingers he
slumped unconscious to the floor of
the entry

  solly bricker had arrived

chapter iv

the man of the night

  the moments that followed the fall
of harry vincent were thrilling ones
ferret daniel antrim and solly
bricker were the principal actors in an
exciting scene the supernumeraries
were a quartet of hoodlums who had
followed solly into the apartment

  daniel antrim heard the scuffle at
the door his revolver was in his hand
as harry vincent fell instinctively
the stout lawyer swung to meet the new
menace his bloated face was blue with
excitement

  antrim was between two enemies


the shadow magazine

ferret unarmed and solly a formi-
dable foeman seeing the surge of men
in the doorway he sensed that a third
real danger lay there

   ferret shrewd in spite of his predica-
ment began to move cunningly the mo-
ment that antrim turned away he
was swift yet cautious as he sank to
the floor and extended a furtive hand
toward his gun

   it was not only fear of attracting an-
trims attention that withheld ferret
it was also uncertainty regarding solly
bricker ferret knew that the notori-
ous gang leader might shoot first and
inquire afterward

  solly himself had need of prompt
action his arm was down following
the blow that he had delivered to harry
vincent his men were in back of him
blocked from action by their leaders
body

  solly coming up with his gun in-
tended to cover antrim until he knew
how matters stood but with the law-
yer wildly springing to an attack solly
was forced to act quickly

  antrim was about to fire solly his
body turned could not beat him to the
shot the gangster dropped away and
his men inspired by their leaders ac-
tion scrambled back into the hallway

  had antrim been capable of pressing
his advantage he might have broken the
attack for the cards were momentarily
in his favor but the lawyer a poor
handler of a revolver did exactly what
solly had expected him to do he fired
at the spot where the gang leader had
been not where the enemy was now lo-
cated

   the lawyers first bullet crashed into
the wall a full foot above sollys shoul-
der his second shot was even wider
of its mark

  now came sollys reply from the ris-
ing automatic the gangsters shot was
close it whizzed by antrims body just
as the lawyer realizing his former mis-
take was lowering his gun toward solly

    had the duel remained in the hands
  of these two men the next second of
  action would have decided the outcome

 daniel antrim had his finger on the
  trigger solly bricker was ready with
  his next shot each had gained a sure
  aim their shots were about to be
  discharged simultaneously

    but neither had reckoned with fer-
  ret sliding toward his revolver the
  stoop-shouldered man with the crafty
  eyes was watching the participants in
  the exciting affray

    even before they fired their first
  shots he saw that neither would be con-
  cerned with him

    ferrets cunning glide had turned to
  a quick movement

    he was up with his gun at the crucial
  moment his finger tightening on the
  trigger a loud report and daniel an-
  trim toppled sidewise just as he was
  about to fire

    so short was the time between fer-
  rets shot and the imminent outcome of
  the duel between antrim and solly that
  the latter had no time to alter his aim
  his shot followed zimming just above
  the head of the crumpling lawyer

    ferret waited no longer with a
  wicked chuckle he dived for the door
  that led to the rear of the apartment
  he had decided this conflict just as he
  had threatened to do he had wounded
  antrim and left the rest for solly
  with the echoes of the gunfire resound-
  ing through the apartment it was time
  for him to be on his way

    solly did not notice ferrets de-
  parture this man-he did not know
  ferrets identity-had saved his life
  antrim crumpled on the floor was try-
  ing his best to raise himself to a firing
  position solly bricker showed him
  no mercy

    thrice the gang leaders automatic
  pumped leaden carriers of death into
  the writhing form daniel antrim the
  double-crosser lay dead and motionless
the shadow magazine



when solly lowered his pistol and strode
to the desk

  he snatched up the documents that
lay there his quick scrutiny revealed
that they referred to him they be-
trayed antrims plans to have bricker
brought to justice-because solly had
refused to enter into a compact with
the crooked lawyer

  antrim had never threatened but
from the moment that solly had re-
ceived ferrets phone call he had been
suspicious that fact had accounted
for his prompt arrival withhis mob

  cursing solly spat at the dead man
on the floor then recalling the begin-
ning of the conflict he turned to the
door through which his four gorillas
were appearing

  get that guy exclaimed solly
the one i knocked cold drag him in
here

  the gang leader thrust the incrim-
inating papers in his pocket and
watched as the hoodlums lugged harry
vincent to the center of the room their
victim was still senseless

  prop him up two of you ordered
solly the others stand guard one
at the front door one at the back
were going to scram

  harry his body twisted crazily was
spreadeagled by his outstretched arms
his form was held upright between two
sullen-faced mobsters his head was
leaning face downward the side of
his face and neck showed the mark of
the blow that solly had delivered

  stalking forward solly clenched his
left fist and brought it upward brutally
he struck harry forcibly on the chin
and the helpless mans head flopped
back solly leered at the pale ex-
pressionless face

  hes out declared the mob leader
out cold thats because  hit him

i knock em cold weve got to scram
no time to waste hold him-ill do
the rest

  he stepped back and calmly leveled

his automatic at harry vincents heart
with cool indifference solly placed his
finger on the trigger and prepared to
viciously end the life of the shadows
operative

  it seemed certain doom for harry
vincent two gangsters were clutch-
ing him an armed man was at each
entrance solly bricker was about to
fire

  no one moved as solly took deliberate
aim the man at the rear exit was
peering through the doorway the man
on guard at the front door interested
in the craftsmanship of his leader had
turned his head to watch solly

  five mobsmen-all armed and un-
scathed harry vincent weaponless
and unconscious

  these were odds that solly bricker
liked a million to one in his favor
so he thought

  but solly was wrong neither he nor
any of the watching men saw the long
black shadow that projected itself upon
the floor it started from the hallway
and above it loomed the man himself-
a tall silent figure clad in black cloak
and slouch hat

  the shadow was present

  had the mysterious arrival relied
upon a single gun had he acted in
haste or had he yielded a sound to tell
of his presence he could not have saved
the life of harry vincent but the
shadow never erred

  each of his black-gloved hands
clutched an automatic with smooth
certain motion he nudged the pistol in
his left hand against the body of the
man at the door and pointed the right-
hand gun directly at solly bricker
both pistols spoke together so that the
two shots sounded like one of terrific
volume

  the first shot eliminated the man at
the door he dropped forward a
wound in his side the other shot
struck sollys forearm just above the


the shadow magazine

wrist and plowed on into the gang lead-
ers body

  the shadows right arm was ex-
tended his left held dose to his body

  his left hand moved forward from
the recoil of the  the gun barrel
now rested squarely on the crook of his
right elbow

  the left-hand gun spoke again with
perfect aim its bullet clipped the man
at the opposite door before the startled
gunman could recover from his surprise
the watching gangster went down

  as the left hand drew back the right
whirled and the two automatics were
covering the men who held harry vin-
cent 

  one against five-yet the shadow
had turned the tables in one quick sec-
ond a perfect marksman every one
of his timed actions led to another
three shots each calculated had dis-
posed of three enemies the other two
were in the shadows power

  here entered the element of uncer-
tainty sollys last two retainers were
neither cowardly nor brave they were
toughened gang fighters who liked to
shoot down helpless victims at the same
time they were men who believed in
fighting as the best means of self-
preservation

  they realized nothing of the
shadows strategy they only knew
that they were in a tough spot as men
who had never given mercy they ex-
pected none each with the same
thought-knowing that they were two
against one-let go his hold on harry
vincent and swung his revolver toward
the menacing form in black

  the shadow had two bullets for
them his left-hand pistol spouted
flame as a quick shot flattened the nearer
gunman but the attacker on the
right was a graver menace he dropped
to the floor as harrys body fell he
was behind the crumpling form and
his revolver was coming up

  the shadow fired his bullet grazed

the gangsters left shoulder as he
hunched away from danger an inch
lower and the shot would have told
but an inch lower would have made
harrys form the target

  the gangsters right hand swung up
in front of harrys body the man
pressed the trigger once-twice-

  but the hasty shots went wide the
shadow too was moving he was
coming forward swiftly just as the hand
appeared forward and to the right-
missing the area covered by the re-
volver

  the shadows left arm stretching far
and low delivered a shot that prevented
a third bullet from the gangster it
clicked the top of the revolver barrel
and ricocheted to the wall beyond

  instinctively the gangster drew away
and in that action he displayed his neck
and shoulders above harrys body the
shadows right hand acted

  that finished the conflict a single
shot from close range was delivered by
the hand that never failed the bullet
paralyzed the mobster as it took him in
the neck along the spine the last of
the shadows enemies sprawled face
downward on the floor

  the shadows automatics went be-
neath his cloak a long stride and he
was plucking harry vincent from the
floor distant shouts were coming from
the hall the shadow employing amaz-
ing strength lifted harry and carried
him through the rar door of the apart-
ment

  when two policemen dashed into the
apartment a moment later they found
solly bricker and his crew sprawled
out with the body of daniel antrim

   solly like the lawyer was dead the
shadows timely shot had reached his
heart after clipping his extended fore-
arm

  from the fire tower which opened
on a small courtyard behind the apart-
ment a body appeared as though
the shadow magazine



suspended in space it was harry vin-
cents form supported by the invisible
figure of the shadow then the car-
rying figure showed in the filtering
light like a black phantom of the night

  he was bearing his companion away
to safety suddenly the shadow
stopped he set harrys form against
the wall his figure loomed over the
unconscious man like a protecting
guardian his black cloak masked
harrys presence as completely as if it
had been blotted out by night

  the light of an electric torch ap-
peared a policeman attracted by the
shots was entering the alley he
neared the fire tower uncertain of
his surroundings lie turned and his
flashlight gleamed directly upon the fig-
ure of the shadow

  the policeman was dumfounded his
revolver in his left hand his torch in
his right he might have killed the
shadow but he never gained the ad-
vantage

  the shadow dropped forward catch-
ing the policemans wrists twisting
powerfully he whirled the officers body
in a circle

  the revolver and the flashlight shot
through the air in opposite directions
the policeman landed on his back and
rolled over twice stooping the
shadow raised harrys body and car-
ried it swiftly toward the street

  the policeman momentarily dazed
saw his flashlight shining on the ground
he leaped for it and flashed it back and
forth it located his revolver he hur-
ried toward the street-with many sec-
onds lost

  the patrolman looked up and down
forty feet away he saw a man halfway
in the door of a parked automobile the
policeman raised his revolver and ran
shouting in that direction

  the man emerged from the car and
stood awaiting him the policeman
stopped short he was facing a tail
man immaculately clad in evening

clothes the man blocked the door of
the car the officers flashlight shining
beyond showed thick darkness within
the vehicle

  what is the trouble officer

  the gentleman spoke in a quiet voice
the policeman was immediately im-
pressed by his importance the con-
trast between the swift activity of the
shrouded figure in the alley and the
quiet bearing of this individual was
obvious

  not for one moment did the officer
suspect any connection between them
but he figured that this man might serve
as a witness

 a man got away from me back
there declared the policeman waving
his gun toward the entrance of the al-
ley did you see him which way
did he go 

  i saw no one was the quiet re-
sponse

  the policeman stared down the street
toward the corner he decided that his
attacker must have dashed in the op-
posite direction pursuit now would
be useless

  the officer felt that his duty was up
in the apartment building not knowing
that others of the police had already
entered by the front door

  all right he said gruffly sorry
to have bothered you chief it youre
driving away and see any one that
looks suspicious better get to the near-
est policeman

  that is exactly what i shall do

  the officer turned and hurried off to-
ward the apartment house the tall
quiet-faced man watched until he had
disappeared from view then with de-
liberation he reached into the car and
lifted a black garment that lay there
revealing the helpless form of harry
vincent

  the black cloak swished a slouch
hat settled on the tall personages fore-
head with a soft uncanny laugh he
stepped into the car the motor purred


the shadow magazine

rhythmically the car rolled along the
street

  the automobile turned the corner
and headed toward broadway the
driver was silent and almost invisible-
little more than a mass of blackness

  the shadow was taking away his
rescued underling the whispered
laugh reechoed through the car for the
shadow had conquered the fiends of
the underworld

  but harry vincent still senseless
had not yet told the story of the con-
flict the shadow had not learned that
the lone instigator of the wild affray had
escaped

  ferret had gone the shadow un-
able to tarry in daniel antrims apart-
ment had gained no inkling of the
mans departure

chapter v

ferret is pleased

  riding westward on the whirlwind
limited a man in the club car was idly
noting the headlines of a detroit news-
paper the train was speeding through
the michigan countryside the man
who was reading divided his time be-
tween the scenery and the paper

  it was ferret-he who bore the name
joel hawkins leisurely well-attired
he appeared no more than a new york
business man bound for the middle
west

  ferrets eyes gleamed the mans
placidity turned to craftiness as he
noted a certain headline over a new
york news item

gangsters war in new
york apartment

  the account referred to the affray of
the previous night eagerly ferret
scanned the details a puzzled frown
appeared upon his forehead

according to the report a mob of
gunmen had invaded the apartment of a

lawyer named daniel antrim there
guns had broken loose the lawyer had
been slain by the mobsters it had de-
veloped into a shooting party of mag-
nitude-a battle which indicated the
warring of rival factions

  when the smoke had cleared away
the police had entered to find four men
dead and two wounded one of the
dead was daniel antrim the attorney
another was solly bricker notorious
gang leader

  in the latters pocket the police had
discovered papers that showed antrims
handwriting these documents con-
tained evidence incriminating solly
bricker of many misdeeds

  it was evident that daniel antrim
had conducted negotiations with vari-
ous criminals otherwise he could not
have established facts that were entirely
unknown to the police-facts which
manifested themselves in the papers
found on solly bricker

  it was supposed that solly had come
to antrims to discuss affairs of mutual
interest evidently sollys gang had
been lying low in the hallway outside
the apartment the lawyer and the
gang leader had come to guns instead of
terms	y-

  sollys henchmen had rallied to his
rescue but antrim wise to the ways
of gangdom had relied upon a crew of
his own the result had been the end
of solly and his crowd

  there was sufficient proof that men
had escaped from the place daniel
antrim could not have accounted for
five enemies single-handed all indi-
cations showed that he had been put out
of action early in the melee moreover
the dead and wounded were all of sol-
lys outfit	

  a policeman eiering the rear of the
apartment while his fellows were com-
ing in through the front had encoun-
tered an escaping man the officer had
failed to stop the fugitive thus it
was positive that at least one man had
shad-  a
the shadow magazine



made a get-away from the premises
others might have gone before

  ferret wondered the amazing re-
sult of the fracas seemed incredible
the one escaping man-that must have
been the fellow whom solly cracked at
the door ferret had seen the man go
down completely out

  had he come to life and accounted
for the gangsters single-handed that
seemed to be the only answer

  ferret read the account again and
again he threw the paper aside and
stared unseeing from the window

  after all what did it matter the
affair was for the best daniel antrim
was dead-and the blame lay on solly
had the gang leader gotten away the
police would now be looking for the
lawyers slayer as it was they were
seeking among gangsters who were
known to be inimical to solly bricker

  a satisfied smile curled over ferrets
lips he had gone against majors in-
structions he had walked into a tough
spot looking for personal revenge when
he should have been serving the five
chameleons

  he had stepped away in safety and
the others had shot it out ferret had
started something with which he would
never be connected it was work that
he iked he had done well in new
york

  now his opportunity lay far away
unmixed with affairs in new york he
could pursue his intended task he
grinned as he thought of major his
companion would never know of fer-
rets unscheduled activity in new york

  ferret bore the air of a man who has
squared accounts he picked up the
newspaper again and rested his finger
on the name of daniel antrim a
fiendish sneer came over his face

  then realizing that persons might be
watching him the stoop-shouldered man
dropped the journal and walked back to-
ward the dining car

 shad-a

  the longer ferret considered the sub-
ject the- more pleased he became with
his own immunity at times he had
qualms fearing that major might read
the account of the gun battle and per-
ceive some connection between it and
ferret but he soon dismissed these
thoughts as ridiculous

  when the limited reached chicago
ferret obtained a local newspaper and
perused a fuller account of the new
york affair the chicago journals were
always ready to play up shooting
matches that took place in manhattan

  the chief concern of the new york
police he read appeared to be directed
toward the future the affair at an-
trims might mean the beginning of ex-
tended feuds

  taking another train in chicago fer-
ret proceeded westward he was com-
ing to the ena of his journey far away
from new york it was late the fol-
lowing afternoon when the train ap-
proached the stop of middletown junc-
tion that was ferrets destination

  he alighted at the platform of an
old station the short branch line run-
ning to middletown was no longer in
operation a bus had replaced it

  ferret took the bus and half an hour
later the vehicle stopped on the main
street of a prosperous middle western
town ferret stepped off and consulted
a paper which he drew from his pocket

  he asked no questions here suit-
case in hand he sauntered along the
main street he walked by a block of
modern construction made up of new
buildings all connected into one tojorm
the pride of middletown

  ferret noticed a marble-fronted bank
in the middle of the block a larger
bank occupied the farthest corner here
ferret turned right and crossed the
town square

  he had never been in middletown be-
fore yet he knew his way perfectly
on the opposite side of the square he
entered the beginning of a residential


the shadow magazine

district and within a few blocks he
turned up the walk to the front door
of a good-sized house here he rang
the bell and a maid quickly appeared in
answer

  ferret handed her a card that bore
the name of joel hawkins he in-
quired if mr traver was at home the
maid responded in the affirmative and
conducted ferret into a small parlor
she returned later and led him to the
door of a room near the back of the first
floor

  ferret entered and grinned a man
was seated at a desk going over a
stack of mail he was a man past mid-
dle age of strong physique and stern
face his thick hair was gray and he
carried himself like a prosperous man
who held a high position in his com-
munity ferret closed the door

  hello judge he said

  the man looked up sternly

 you are mr hawkins he in-
quired

  ferret taken aback by this could only
nod

  you wish to see me came the
question

  yes-er-mr traver said ferret

  a broad grin appeared upon the gray-
haired mans face he arose and walked
over to ferret he shoved out his hand
and ferret accepted it with another grin

  glad to see you ferret said judge
in a pleased tone major wired me
that you would be here first you made
good time have you been behaving
yourself 

  yes lied ferret

  he met judges cold questioning
stare the other man appeared satis-
fied ferret was inwardly relieved
major might be shrewd but he could
not compare with judge this man
despite an expression of benignity that
cloaked his countenance was one who
could not be easily deceived

  sit down invited judge

  ferret obeyed

  we shall not go into details to-
night declared judge there will be
plenty of time-after you have ac-
climated yourself to middletown but
remember ferret this is a small city
it has its own ways and you must ac-
custom yourself to them middletown
is not new york

  the comparison was an apt one
though judge did not realize it it made
an immediate impression upon ferret
who was fresh from his new york ad-
venture

  judge still speaking quietly rang a
bell the maid entered

  mr hawkins will remain for din-
ner announced judge

  ferret was thinking wondering
what lay ahead in middletown judge
was his leader a man whom ferret
feared and obeyed

  his inability to foresee the future
made ferrets mind swing to the past-
to the last day on the yacht when they
had drunk the health of judge-to the
instructions given him by major-to
his defiance of those orders and the
resulting fight at antrims

  judge was finishing his work at the
desk and ferrets thoughts were miles
away his half-closed eyes were pic-
turing the wounded form of daniel an-
trim the menacing figure of solly
bricker-

  then into ferrets mind came spec-
ulation over the strange outcome of the
fray it was a matter that had trou-
bled him ever since he had read the
first report in the detroit newspaper

  who had brought the battle to its
strange ending who could have en-
tered to deal death and destruction-
then to escape before the police arrived 

  as though endowed with clairvoyance
ferret was visualizing some one in back
of the grim game at antrims-a figure
of power and of vengeance as judge
began to speak ferret brought himself
back to his surroundings and the mo-

the villains

butcher

   here they are-five men of crime
so great so subtle that many patient
uncomplaining years have been spent
preparing for the evil ferret and
butcher and major and judge--all of
whom are employed in the bank of
which judge is president and deacon
gloomy as befits one of his profession
as the undertaker who has come into their very thriving community

    all are men well known in their city all of them are respected per-
forming their tasks to the satisfaction of their clients looked upon as
the guiding spirits of their little world what insidious plan is lurking
behind their efforts for what is all this planned how will they strike

    there is a theme that furnishes the most thrilling experience the
shadow has ever had at no other time has this strange creature of the
night come so near to his doom and never has he had such a thrilling
triumph

udge

deacon

major

mentary vision faded from his mind
ferret was laughing at his own fears

  yet in that moment he had been near
to the truth safe from gangdom safe
from the law ferret could not be free
from a man who knew both-yet
worked with neither

  crafty though ferret had been his
escape and his new environment could
not remain unknown to the shadow

chapter vi

the work begins

  weeks had passed since ferret had
come to middletown despite its loca-
tion in a thinly populated region of the
middle west the city was used to stran-
gers and it was an easy matter for a
newcomer to become accepted there

  ferret had learned this living in a
downtown rooming house he had made
many acquaintances and was now a set-
tled resident moreover he had a job
-one that presented attractive possi-
bilities

  ferret was a teller in the middletown
trust company the bank situated in the
center of the block he had noticcd on
his first day in town he represented
the first of a new group of employees
who had slowly been engaged during a
minor reorganization of the banks staff

  on this particular day ferret was
busy at his window conducting himself
in typical teller fashion ferret looked
back and forth with sidelong glance
and grinned as he sat behind his win-
dow

  a depositor approaching the window


the shadow magazine

mistook the grin for a pleasant greet-
ing and waved his hand in a friendly
manner

  hello mr hawkins

  good afternoon responded ferret

  with the customer gone ferrets grin
continued he looked to his left where
the other tellers window was located
a small sign by the grated window bore
the legend

mr ellsworth

  ferret glanced at the man behind the
window ellsworth was a new teller
here he and ferret had become but
recently acquainted as far as middle-
town knew but the big bluff face was
one which ferret knew well george
ellsworth-known to ferret as butcher

  across from the barred windows was
a desk that bore the sign

mr exton
cashier

  there was major seated at the desk
discussing a loan with a local business
man major made a good banker fer-
ret decided he might have been a
cashier all his life as far as observers
were concerned ferret and butcher
tellers were capable ones but not so
effective as major the cashier

  yet the three could not compare with
the austere individual wrho was now en-
tering the private office in the corner
he was the banker par-excellence

david traver
president

  judge looked the part he was built
for that position he was the most
outstanding bank official that middle-
town had ever boasted no wonder
ferret thought judge had been here
for a long while rising in the affairs of
the community

  the rest of the bank workers were
local talent chiefly girls their posi-
tions were of a clerical nature the

other officials of the bank excepting
judge were men of small caliber who
depended entirely upon the wisdom of
the president who had brought success
to their local enterprise

  the doors of the bank were closed
now it was after three oclock busi-
ness had not been heavy and it took
ferret only a short while to finish up
waving to butcher as he passed ferret
left by the front door of the bank the
old watchman opening the big gate to
allow the tellers passage

  on the street ferret nodded cor-
dially to several persons he passed
people were friendly in middletown

  ferret sauntered past various stores
and turned the corner as he came to the
downtown end of the block he glanced
at the sign upon a plate-glass window
it read

middletown
funeral parlor

  a man was standing behind the win-
dow he had a gloomy melancholy air
his face pale in contrast to his black
frock coat he was wearing a pointed
collar with a black bow tie his ex-
pression was ministerial he seemed
content with his environment

  wrapped in his thoughts the under-
taker paid no attention to ferrets side-
long gaze ferret laughed to himself
as he continued up the street the man
who presided over the middletown fu-
neral parlor was none other than dea-
con

  ferret was chuckling with admira-
tion if judge made the ideal bank
president deacon was certainly unsur-
passed as a funeral director ferret re-
membered the day-not long ago--when
deacon had made his debut here

  the funeral parlor had been for sale
deacon had arrived in town to look
over the business situation he had
immediately arranged to purchase the
place
the shadow magazine



  now howard best was the new mid-
dletown undertaker he had started in
enterprising fashion a shipment of
modern caskets had arrived in town to
replace the antiquated coffins which had
made up the former stock

  ferret lounged along the street and
finally reached the house where he lived

  he was to dine at the home of the
bank president others would be there
and after dinner ferret expected a most
important discussion

  it was six oclock when ferret
wended his way to the residence of da-
vid traver the bank president was a
bachelor who lived alone he had
made it a habit to invite certain of his
employees and associates to dinner on
occasion to-night ferret respected
under the name of joel hawkins
rubbed shoulders with some of the elite
of middletown

  one man in particular engaged his
interest that was harvey bronlon
who was the most important man in
middletown

  bronlon had become a great factor in
the life of the community that was
apparent from the conversation that
passed between him and judge during
dinner-conversation to which all
listened with intense interest

  there are great days ahead for mid-
dletown mr bronlon declared judge
in an impressive tone

  bronlon nodded his massive head a
huge bulk of a man he looked like an
overfed lion he stared about the
group with eyes that peered solemnly
from beneath overhanging eyebrows

  if middletown is progressing he
said such capable men as you are to be
thanked for it mr traver

  no said judge shaking his head
in a kindly manner a bank merely
reflects the prosperity of the people and
adds to the stability of the community
it is a man like you who possesses en-
terprise that brings progress

  bronlon seemed pleased by the com-
pliment

  so far he declared rather proudly
my foresight has been realized when
i built the big central block a year ago
every one doubted its possibilities look
at it now mr traver every footage
of front is occupied your bank is
there the county national holds a
corner we have the largest store in
town two restaurants an undertaking
establishment-

  he waved his hands to indicate that
his property was all rented

  remarkable forethought mr bron-
lon observed a guest i have often
wondered where you have gained your
keen knowledge of the future

  there is nothing remarkable about
it replied bronlon in a somewhat
modest tone first i have my own
plant and other business as an index
we are employing more men than ever
at the canning factory up there we
have had but one difficulty in the past
strikes

  several persons nodded their heads
reminiscently

  strikes gentlemen continued the
manufacturer threatened the progress
of middletown in the past it was not
until i solved that problem that this
community became assured of the
prosperity it now enjoys my bonus
system was the solution

  the workers are satisfied now
some one inquired

  satisfied and loyal asserted bron-
lon within the next few months a
large annual bonus is due them by
agreement i hope to please them by
declaring it in advance

  all present knew that harvey bron-
lon was speaking correctly the number
of employees at his large factory had
increased to more than three thousand
all residents of middletown and the sur-
rounding villages he had large inter-
ests in other enterprises he had


the shadow magazine

established the bonus system in some
of these

  moreover bronlon due to his posi-
tion in the canning industry furnished
the outlet for farm products through-
out the entire region he was coming
to that very point in his discussion

  middletown he said is the natural
center for this region i saw its pos-
sibilities when my business was develop-
ing we have a key city here and i
have done my best to make it thrive
middletowns population is not large
compared with other cities but its im-
portance is tremendous when you con-
sider it the center of a definite area

  all nodded in agreement harvey
bronlon had painted a striking picture
of the conditions that existed here he
had neglected the negative side of his
story however

  other towns which had formerly
shared laurels with middletown had
been stifled in their growth they like
the rural sections were dependent en-
tirely upon the key city harvey bron-
lon had assumed the position of a feudal
lord holding sway over an extensive
region

  the dinner had drawn to a close
bronlon arose and shook hands with
judge he announced that he had an
appointment for the evening and left

  judge accompanied him to the door
bronlon walking heavily and leaning
on a stout cane a chauffeur stationed
outside saw his bulk in the doorway
and pulled up in the limousine

  without the officious industrialist
the party at judges home had paled
most of the guests were men who
sought to curry favor with harvey
bronlon they had come because of
him they were leaving now because he
had gone

  judge beaming iti a friendly man-
ner shook hands one by one as a
man in good standing with bronlon he
was also a figure of importance in mid-

dletown but he alone could not hold
the throng

  at last all that remained were judge
major butcher and ferret deacon
was absent the new undertaker in
middletown had not yet gained suffi-
cient prestige to be a guest at one of
the bank presidents exclusive dinners

  there was nothing to excite comment
in the sight of a bank president conduct-
ing three of his employees to a study in
his home once there judge eyed
them calm

  we begin to-night he said quietly

  to-night asked major

  yes said judge with a smile i
begin perhaps you begin also not
just as you have expected

  whats up questioned butcher

  delmar is coming here within an
hour

  they were surprised at judges state-
ment roland delmar was the head of
the county national-the largest bank
in middletown the middletown trust
company was a small institution com-
pared with the county national

  whats he coming here for asked
butcher

  you will see said judge

  major alone nodded he looked at
judge and smiled perhaps if deacon
had been present the solemn-faced man
would have smiled too-although dea-
con was sparing with smiles

  do you see that door asked major
when we hear the bell ring the three
of you go in there you can listen
then i wont have to tell you so much
afterward

  it means were going to- began

butcher

  judge stopped him

  yes he said deacon and major
have been doing night work some that
you expected other that may surprise
you that is all you need to know just
now butcher let the rest come-
from delmar

  the topic changed ferret listened
the shadow magazine



keenly and his shrewd eyes looked from
one man to another to-night was to be
the beginning for the others per-
haps but not for ferret he dated the
beginning of his new career with that
night in new york

  ferrets eyes gleamed as he smiled
none of his companions had spoken of
the death of daniel antrim the case
had not been mentioned in recent new
york newspapers that ferret had
bought

  no one ferret thought could know
one iota of his connection with the death
of the crooked lawyer police and gangs
alike were in ignorance who else mat-
tered 

  ferret did not know of the shadow

  the shadow knew

chapter vii

the shadow ponders

  at the very moment when ferret in
middletown was fancying that the af-
fairs of joel hawkins were of little in-
terest elsewhere a brain in uptown new
york was thinking of ferret

  the scene was a windowless room
furnished with bookcases filing cab-
inets a desk and a single chair there
were lights in the room but each was
centered on a different object

  a green-shaded bulb threw a circle
of light upon the desk other smaller
incandescents glimmered their rays upon
the cabinets and the bookcases

  the center of the room was dark and
spectral only the edges were il-
luminated the floor was heavily car-
peted in jet black the walls showed no
opening despite the fringing lights
not even a shadow could be seen upon
the sable floor

  yet there in that weird gloom some
one stood the sole occupant of the
mysterious abode was an invisible be-
ing who seemed a part of the thick
blackness in the center

  for this aas the shadows secret

place of consultation the books in
the shelves were funds of information
that covered the specific subjects which
intrigued the shadow the filing cases
contained full cross-indexed informa-
tion on persons and events which had
concerned him

  one portion of a bookcase was closed
by a metal panel its smooth surface
bore no lock yet only the shadow
could open it

  behind that sheet of steel were spe-
cial books that the shadow guarded be-
yond all else they were his secret
archives-amazing volumes from which
his annals were prepared

  the presence of the shadow mani-
fested itself when a long black arm
reached out as though from space a
white hand opened the drawer of a fil-
ing cabinet another hand came into
view upon one tapering finger shone
a strange mystic gem-the girasol or
fire opal which was the shadows only
jewel

  th girasol glimmered with deep
crimson that sparkled and changed to
a rich purple as the hand of the shadow
stopped upon a file that bore the letter
a the hands disappeared carrying
a paper into the darkness they reap-
peared by the table

  here the unseen eyes of the shadow
began a study of important data in the
case of daniel antrim it was not the
first time that this subject had gained
the shadows interest flis delving
into the affairs of the defunct lawyer
had been a laborious process 

  the morning after the affray at an-
trims harry vincent had awakened to
find himself in his room at the metrolite
hotel he had sent a complete report
of the event to the shadow

  it had begun with harrys observa-
tion of an unknown man creeping down
the hall it had ended with the blow
that flarry had received from solly

  this had given the shadow an


the shadow magazine

inkling of the affair yet until now
the man in black had not possessed the
fund of knowledge necessary to draw
conclusions in the case

  the reports on daniel antrim had
been assembled tediously by the
shadows agents all data had reached
headquarters in this room

  back at the filing cabinet the
shadow brought out another paper from
file f this when placed upon the
table showed the name of hawk
forster memoranda concerning such
a small-fry gangster had not been ac-
quired easily hawk forster had
thrived as an underling with many
mobs

  a low laugh came through the gloom
above the light it echoed with a hol-
low tone from the walls and ceiling
reverberating it seemed to die away
at the floor as though absorbed by the
thick blackness there

  the shadows hands were out of
sight then they reappeared at the
metal panel which fronted the case of
archives

  here the hands moved back and forth
lightly touching portions of the panel
their motions were like those of a mes-
merist and with their action the panel
responded in mysterious fashion the
metal barrier melted downward into
the floor itself

  small lights within the uncovered
section of the bookcase showed a row
of black-bound books from each shone
a date inscribed in gold numerals

  the shadows hands drew one of
these volumes from its special place
book and hands vanished then came
into view again beneath the table lamp
the hands opened the book

  the girasol gleamed above parch-
ment pages each contained its record
-not printed but inscribed in perfectly
engrossed lettering the preparation
of these pages had been the work of a
painstaking recorder

  the hands turned the leaves until th 

reached the spot that they required
there a forefinger traccd a paragraph
the action was slow and deliberate

  the hand was lifted the book was
closed it was replaced by those same
hands among the secret archives the
automatic panel came upward and
closed the opening

  the shadows record books were not
only accounts of what had happened in
the past they served as a guide for
the present and an index to the future
here by exacting research the
shadow had gained an inkling of some
strange work that was afoot

  by a process of keen elimination he
had cut down the associates of hawk
forster to one whom he could in some
manner identify with daniel antrim

  to-nights work had been a check-up
of his labors in his secret archives
which told of all that he observed and
knew the shadow had found the key
to the affairs of certain men

  the room seemed lifeless as the
shadow pondered his mind was bridg-
ing a gap of time from the past he
was determining the future

  minutes rolled slowly by then the
white hands came from the folds of
the cloak and appeared upon the table
the fingers of the right hand penciled
these words upon a sheet of paper

  they - have but one possible purpose

     the time and method of operation

  depends upon the place    the choice

   of place is restricted   

  the writing ceased the shadow
moved away from the desk his left
hand appeared beside a bookcase that
continued up to the dark ceiling

  the hand touched a hidden switch
from a cylinder on the top edge of the
bookcase a mammoth map of the
united states unrolled itself until it cov-
ered half the surface of the wall

  the eyes of the shadow were study-
ing the illuminated chart at last the
the shadow magazine



inspection was ended the map rolled
upward in response to the shadows
touch

  back at the desk the hand inscribed
a list of places visualized from the map
these were considered by the hidden
eyes

  the hands tore the paper into frag-
ments a name on each piece it ar-
ranged them slowly choosing each one
with care until the task was satisfac-
torily ended at the top of the list ap-
peared the name of middletown

  the hands of the shadow had done
their work the eyes of the shadow
had seen the result now the voice of
the shadow whispered through the
room he was talking over a telephone
located somewhere in the darkness

  mysterious instructions were going
over the wire to burbank the shadows
competent aid they were spoken in a
terse low-toned voice the meaning of
the cryptic sentences were clear to the
man at the other end

  the shadow was arranging his affairs
in new york he had a mission some-
where else-and the name of middle-
town was uppermost the ways of the
shadow were mysterious the activities
of the shadow were many therein
lay his penchant for method

  the shadow though he stalked alone
would never call a truce in his war with
the underworld he relied upon his
subordinates to carry on the lesser work
when duty demanded his presence else-
where

  what he had uncovered now only
the shadow knew but with the de-
lays that had impeded progress there
was no time for a preliminary survey

  the shadow had spotted middletown
as a place where crime was brewing
it would be his own mission to go there
-not the task of a subordinate

  the hand of the shadow wrote its
last notations-a series of tabulations
that referred to certain operatives
there appeared the names of harry

vincent and cliff marsland two bold
adventurers who served him

  following them was the name of rut-
ledge mann an investment broker
whose office was the clearing-house for
the routine work of the shadow

  last of all came clyde burke the
newspaper reporter whose services
could be pressed into duty at the
shadows bidding

  these operatives were in new york
ready to spring to action should their
master need them they were pre-
pared to go anywhere at any time in
response to the shadows orders

  through the connecting line of bur-
bank through detailed instructions
mailed to rutledge mann the shadow
could thwart the underworld in many
places at once his faithful yeomen
were weapons like his automatics

  conflict lay ahead the shadow
dark mysterious and unseen was go-
ing forth to strike no one would know
of his presence until he struck his
territory was everywhere his resources
were unlimited

  the hands of the shadow appeared
before a filing cabinet in the corner
they drew forth the bottom drawer in
response to a secret mechanism all the
drawers of the cabinet extended-in
steps the tops of these projections
were covered with a solid surface

  the black cloak swished as the
shadow strode up the stairs that he
had formed the same action that had
opened the cabinet raised an invisible
panel in the wall poised before this
secret exit the shadow laughed while
the notes of his mirthless tone still clung
within the room the panel dropped and
the stairs slid mechanically back into
position in the cabinet

  the lights went out when the motion
was complete the room was in total
darkness even then the sound of that
mysterious laugh continued a fading
echo

  the shadow was on his way to the


the shadow magazine

distant city of middletown where at
that very moment crime and death were
stalking

chapter viii

judge decides

  fkkkkt was the first to hear the bell
he signaled to his three companions
who were conversing in judges study

is that delmar he questioned

  judge nodded he motioned toward
the door ferret major and butcher
filed away and entered a dark closed
passage that led away from the study
they were out of sight when the maid
arrived to announce roland delmar

  two minutes later a kindly white-
haired gentleman entered the study

good evening mr traver he said

  good evening mr delmar replied
the man whom his hidden companions
knew as judge

  roland delmar sat down wearily he
looked across the desk toward judge

  there was a marked contrast between
these men despite the fact that they
were about the same age delmars hair
was snow-white his face was worn
he was a man who had lost enthusi-
asm in life he was on the decline

  he might have been a lesson for
judge whose gray hair and deep-fur-
rowed face showed the marks of time
with a few more years the contrast
might be ended but judge made no
comment either concerning his visitors
appearance or his purpose in coming for
this conference

  delmar seeing that he must open the
conversation began with an effort he
braced himself noticeably and abruptly
came to the point of his visit

  the county national bank he said
is facing a terrible crisis mr traver
i have come to discuss the matter with
you

  i am surprised to hear that mr
delmar responded judge we have
been experiencing an excellent period
with the trust company perhaps-if x

may presume-the fault lies in a lack of
progressiveness within your organiza-
tion i have been injecting a new spirit
into my own business it might be a
good plan for you to do likewise

  we are losing confidence declared
delmar in a tired tone you must
admit mr traver that although busi-
ness conditions are good in middletown
there is a certain failing in the sur-
rounding communities middletown has
been drawing heavily upon the rest of
the territory

  middletown is progressive

  do you think so mr traver i
have been here for many years and in
the present condition i see prosperity
on the surface only considering the
entire district of which middletown is
the center i would say that the area is
merely readjusting itself-not progress-
ing

  our bank is showing a steady in-
crease in deposits declared judge qui-
etly	l
of course mr traver responded
delmar that is because you are serv-
ing middletown alone where expansion

is evident-

  quite the contrary mr delmar
interposed judge we are experienc-
ing a tremendous development of our
out-of-town accounts

  that goes with what i have said
declared delmar everything is com-
ing into middletown tradesmen are
bringing their businesses here the
farmers cannot bring their farms so
they are establishing their bank ac-
counts in this community

  which helps your bank as well as
ours

  hardly so mr traver you know
as well as i how the middletown de-
velopment began middletown spread
our bank-the old man spoke proudly
as he remembered days gone by-be-
came powerful throughout the county
by mergers and expansion we estab-
lished branches in every community
the shadow magazine



there are many smaller bankc hat still
remain all are dependent upon the
county national as it goes they go

  then middletown began to contract
it had reached out with the tentacles of
an octopus it drew its arms in again
and brought in all that it desired our
branch banks-the smaller banks which
rely upon us--are nothing but sub-
offices they are not supporting them-
selves we keep them merely for the
convenience of our depositors

  judge nodded in agreement delmar
taking this as a sign of understanding
and sympathy continued

  the founding of your bank the
middletown trust company he stated
was a healthy sign middletown could
use two banks smaller than the county
national you have never established
branches but now people have com-
menced to neglect the branches they
come directly into middletown to find
business here

  we at-the county national are get-
ting a share of the deposits you at the
trust company are experiencing a su-
pernormal growth every new out-of-
town depositor in the trust company
was formerly a depositor in the county
national or one of its subsidiaries
you are exaggerating mr delmar
said judge nevertheless there is
truth in what you say i can tell you
the answer the middletown trust
company has adjusted itself to meet ex-
isting conditions it is living in the
future not the past the county na-
tional bank has not adjusted itself it is
still trying to support past conditions

  i agree with you declared delmar
solemnly but i still insist that the
present is not normal in competing
with the county national the middle-
town trust should establish branch of-
fices of its own-

  but you have said interrupted
judge with a smile that branch offices
are not profitable

  let me finish begged delmar

you should establish branch offices or
we must eliminate ours

  now you have it agreed judge
that is the solution mr delmar

the solution yes said delmar
wearily but it is unfortunately a dan-
gerous solution to attempt it at this
time would mean disaster mr traver
why

  i have come here to tell you why
first because we have lost so many
depositors that our withdrawals have
reached the status of a possible run on
the bank second because harvey
bronlon has ceased to give us our share
of his business

  those two causes may be linked
mr traver you know that bronlon
is the leading spirit of this entire re-
gion his action injured us its result
-the favoring of the middletown trust
as bronlons bank-is likely to ruin us
let us hope not said judge quietly
ordinarily continued delmar with
a touch of pride the county national
would not fear this condition but
there is a third reason mr traver
which i feel that you should know i
am telling it to you in confidence
judge nodded as one banker to an-
other delmar seemed at ease as he
proceeded

  we have suffered an unexpected
loss he declared in a tragic tone
money has been stolen from our bank
i cannot state the exact amount i can
only say that its many thousands

  a look of consternation came over
judges face

  i know this amazes you mr tra-
ver said delmar nevertheless it is
true you will be more amazed when
i add that we have not been able to
trace the method of the removal even
though money has disappeared since we
discovered it was going

  judge seemed to share roland del-
mars worry now he looked at the old
banker in amazement


the shadow magazine

  when did you first discover it
questioned judge

  last week declared delmar we
put a man named wellington on the
job apparently a clerk in our bank
he is in reality a shrewd investigator
wellington is cautious he believed
to-day that he could find something

  he has a clew of some sort but has
not mentioned it he said that would
be bad policy to-night however he
guarantees success when he left my
home as i was coming here he started
directly for the bank

  he is in there alone

  no that is only for a short while
i have sent hubert salisbury my chief
cashier to join him wellington sug-
gested that he would like to have a
trusted man there

  you trust salisbury

  implicitly mr traver he is to
marry my daughter martha hubert
is an honorable young man mr traver
-the very symbol of honesty and reli-
ability i trust him as if he were my
own son

  i understand said judge this
worries me mr delmar it worries me
extremely

  i thought you would appreciate my
difficulties said delmar eagerly that
is why i have told you everything i
wanted you to see the trouble-so that
you would understand when i asked
you this question can you under the
circumstances be ready to assist the
county national in the emergency which
confronts it

  i am sorry mr delmar said
judge sadly in the light of what
you have just told me i could not pos-
sibly lend the aid of my bank

  roland delmar sank back in his
chair with a deep groan

  you appreciate my position said
judge how can you ask me what
you have you have admitted that the
county national has lost money through

some unknown channel to fill up the
empty space you would like me to sup-
ply you with funds-to make up for
your neglect suppose the leak should
continue-where would my bank be 
no mr delmar that is out of the
question

  you cant refuse me exclaimed
delmar hoarsely do you know what
this means the county national will
be forced to close its doors that will
he a blow to the whole financial struc-
ture of this region the run will be on
your bank mr traver as well as on
mine

  we shall be prepared for it de-
clared judge dont forget mr del-
mar that should your bank fail the
middletown trust will offset heavy
withdrawals with new deposits

  were not going to fail if i can help
it declared delmar with a sudden
grimness we have enough assets now
to withstand tremendous withdrawals
but should the rate increase or confi-
dence be entirely lost we would face
the emergency that i have asked you to
prevent

  and which i cannot attempt to pre-
vent added judge firmly further
discussion is useless mr delmar
roland delmar arose a broken man
he made one final plea

  i am going directly to my home he
said if you should change your de-
cision-

  i shall phone you said judge in a
kindly tone suppose mr delmar
-he seemed to have a sudden change of
thought-that i think this over and
call you within an hour there is a
chance-a slight chance-that i might
alter my decision

  ah-through harvey bronlon
  perhaps

  with this slight reviving hope ro-
land delmar walked from the room ac-
companied by judge the latter saw
his visitor from the house

  turning he rushed swiftly back to
the shadow magazine



the study he pulled open the door
and admitted his three companions to
the room

  you heard it all r he whispered
  the men replied with nods

  major said judge tensely go
down and get deacon right away he
is at the funeral parlor tell him about
wellington being in the bank-that
young salisbury is there too theres

only one thing to do-

  i get it said major listen-

  he gripped judge by the shoulder
and spoke in a quick low voice

 you remember-i told you-the
first night in there-majors terse
words were bringing nods from judge
- wanted to be safe-just a precau-
tion-deacon said something about a

frame-up-

  go to it interposed judge but
use good judgment im counting on
you and deacon this is a ticklish situ-
ation from what delmar said this
man wellington may be smart we
have to take it for granted that he
knows too much act accordingly
major nodded he swung about and
left the room ferret and butcher
somewhat perplexed looked to judge
for an explanation they got none

  instead judge motioned them to sit
down then in a quiet methodical
tone he began to outline the work they
were to do

  ferrets eyes gleamed as judge un-
folded his plan butchers plump face
showed a brutal grin judge was ex-
plaining a crafty scheme that con-
cernefl the affairs of roland delmar
and the county national bank

chapter ix

mad murder

  a man stopped at the side entrance
of the county national bank he rang
a bell and waited until the metal door
was unclosed he was facing a watch-
man who stood with gun in hand the

watchmans flashlight beamed upon the
visitors face

  hello mr salisbury said the
watchman

  he slipped his revolver back into its
holster and nudged over his shoulder
with his right hand

  hes in there said the watchman
in a low voice waiting for you mr
salisbury

  the heavy door closed behind the
men the watchman led the way into
the main room of the bank it was dark
and salisbury pressed the watchmans
arm a man was approaching through
the gloom

  leave us in here said salisbury
we want to look around a bit and talk
together alone understand

  yes sir said the watchman mr
delmar told me that

  as the watchman started back to-
ward the corridor that led to the side
door hubert salisbury advanced to
meet the approaching man

  they spoke to each other in whispers
then salisbury conducted the other to
a small office at the side here he
turned on a light and sat down at a
desk facing his companion

  hubert salisbury was a clean-cut
chap not more than twenty-five years
of age although his poise and business-
like look marked him as a manure man

  huberts companion-wellington-
was considerably older he seemed to
be a rather slow and dull-witted in-
dividual  but that was affected an ex-
perienced investigator wellington knew
the value of self-effacement alone
with salisbury he quickly dropped his
sluggish attitude

  youve found something ques-
tioned salisbury

  yes declared wellington at
least i think i have i figured this
whole proposition mr salisbury that
watchman of yours makes his rounds
on a rather methodical sort of schedule
it wouldnt be difficult to slip one over


the shadow magazine

on him-provided that you knew his
ways now theres only one method
that could be used to get a line on him
thats to be in here keeping a watch
of your own

  it sounds logical nodded salis-
bury

  well said the investigator the
dough has been grabbed at night who-
ever has been doing it has been mighty
clever studied the vault and been
looking over the whole lay no ordinary
crook

  so ive been laying here on watch
myself more than that ive been fig-
uring how it would be possible to get
in here

  i cant say ive had any luck-ex-
cept that ive picked the one place where
it might work downstairs where all
the safe-dejjosit vaults are located
thats where i want to look

  but thats impossible exclaimed
salisbury that was built as a strong-
room-right in the foundations of the
building youre wrong there welling-
ton-

  im not saying im right inter-
rupted the investigator im only say-
ing that ive studied this place from
the bottom up theres nobody here
outside of mr delmar and yourself that
could know enough about the place to
slide in and out ive eliminated the
employees

  i work this way a thing is being
done how could it be done well
in this case the only system is in and
out by some mighty clever method fi-
nally i hit the idea that the places that
look the weakest might be the strongest
and the places that looked the strongest
might be the weakest

  the mans tone was convincing
while salisbury appeared doubtful he
was nevertheless forced to agree that
wellington might be logical in his as-
sumption

  you think that some one began
salisbury has direct access here-

  i think more than that interposed
wellington i think that this whole
place is a running ground i figure that
some crook-maybe more than one-is
so sure of himself that he can walk in
and out of here any time he pleases

  i wouldnt be surprised if a guy
should walk in here right now and poke
an automatic under our noses

  salisbury shifted uneasily the
idea sounded fantastic nevertheless it
was cause for alarm he looked to-
ward the door of the little office

  with unfeigned apprehension he
arose and opened the door he looked
into the big dark room perhaps well-
ington was right salisbury almost
fancied that he could discern a stealthy
figure moving through the gloom

  what do you propose to do he
questioned

  start a search together rejoined
wellington promptly i dont want to
do it alone i cant cajl the watchman
thats why i wanted you here to-night
ive been suspicious lately-too suspi-
cious to search the way i want if i
had you with me keeping watch i
might le able to get somewhere

  salisbury standing by the door
nodded his agreement wellington
arose and walked over beside him

  ive got a couple of guns said the
investigator tapping his pockets grimly
im going to shoot if i see anything
that looks funny

  now suppose we work it this way
im starting downstairs alone ill have
the light on-just looking around like
ive looked before

  you come down in a few minutes
ive been up here all evening and i just
might run into something for a starter
thats why ill go first youve got a
gun

  a loaded revolver in the bottom
drawer said salisbury pointing to the
desk

  good said the investigator ill
the shadow magazine



go ahead you get your gun and join
me

  wellington left the room and ad-
vanced stealthily through the darkness
salisbury drew a key from his pocket
and unlocked the desk drawer he
raised a pile of papers opened a wooden
box and reached in for his revolver

  to his surprise it was not there hu-
bert salisbury stroked his chin he
was sure that he had put the revolver in
that drawer more than a month ago
he always kept the drawer locked

  had he taken out the revolver or
had some one removed it salisbury
remembered what wellington had said
about persons being in the bank

  this was something that the investi-
gator should know salisbury decided
it might be a minor clew--nevertheless
it was of value

  salisburys revolver was a  of a
special pattern with his initials on the
handle if they should locate it he
would be able to identify it immedi-
ately

  it was time to join wellington leav-
ing the desk salisbury started across
the floor of the banking room he felt
a slight reluctance about joining well-
ington unarmed then he realized that
the investigator had two guns and
would probably provide him with one

  nearing the head of the stairs salis-
bury stopped short

  from below came the report of a re-
volver wellington had said that he
would fire on suspicion had he en-
countered some one

  without hesitation salisbury shouted
and dashed down the stairs he to-
tally forgot that he was without a
weapon

  the room below was lighted turn-
ing the foot of the stairs salisbury
nearly stumbled over the body of a man
he looked about excitedly for welling-
ton the room was empty-save for
the huddled form

  in consternation salisbury stooped

and raised the victims face it was
wellington-dead

  the investigator held no weapon but
on the floor several feet away lay a re-
volver hubert salisbury like a man
in a trance leaped and seized the gun

  he looked everywhere about the
heavy-walled room and stared through
the iron grille work behind which the
safe-deposit vaults were located had
the shot come from there-and had the
revolver followed it

  realizing his dangerous position sal-
isbury turned and dashed up the stairs
at the head he confronted the gleaming
torch of the watchman

  get help exclaimed salisbury
call the police while i wait here some
one has killed wellington

  the watchman hastened away leav-
ing salisbury peering down the stair-
way the watchman had not heard the
shot it was salisburys shout that had
brought him here

  cautiously salisbury crept down the
stairs again and stood there peering
around the corner over wellingtons
body he turned quickly as he heard
men at the top of the stairs

  the watchman was coming with a
middletown police sergeant with a
sigh of relief salisbury stepped toward
wellingtons body and leaned against
the wall as the others arrived

  t dont know who killed him he
said in a tense voice i heard the shot
and i rushed down--

  with solemn face the police sergeant
plucked the revolver from salisburys
hand he glared suspiciously at the
young mans pale face the sergeant
examined the weapon

  this is the gun that killed him
asked the sergeant

  yes replied salisbury

  where did you get it 

  i found it here-on the floor i
picked it up-salisbury suddenly be-
gan to realize the unusualness of his


the shadow magazine

   i dont know who killed him
he said in a tense voice i heard the
shot   

story-because i thought some one
must be here the shot must have
been fired by some one-unless well-
ington killed himself-

 you have a gun of your own in-
 quired the sergeant

 no said salisbury weakly i was

unarmed-

 yet you ran down here

 yes

  the sergeant looked at the weapon in
his hand salisbury looked at the
weapon an astonished gasp came from
his lips it was his missing revolver

  that-that is my-

  salisbury stopped as he was blurt-
ing out his discovery gripped by sud-
den apprehension he could go no
further but the sergeant catching his
tone prompted him

shad-a
the shadow magazine



  what were you saying he quizzed

  denial was useless salisbury
though realizing that he was placing
himself in a hopeless position was
forced to rely upon the truth

  that looks like my revolver he
gasped

  yes

  the sergeants eyes were quizzical as
he looked first at the man then at the
weapon

  h s he said noting the initials on
the handle

  he broke open the revolver and saw
the one fired chamber he looked about
the room he could see but one answer
to the situation

  you say you were unarmed he an-
nounced to salisbury you came down
here because you heard a shot you
pickcd up the gun and started up again
where did you meet the watchman

  just above the head of the stairs
admitted salisbury

  yes  queried the sergeant you
didnt expect to meet him did you 

  no

  hm-m-m declared the sergeant
you might have been on your way out
young fellow the watchman says you
sent him to get us lucky he found us
right outside the door of the bank-
before you had time to get away

  get away echoed salisbury

  yes replied the sergeant firmly
youve told your story salisbury it
doesnt go with what ive seen here
those stairs are the only way in and
out of this place theres the dead
man youre here with your own gun
and theres no question about it-this
gun killed wellington

  the sergeant made a motion to two
policemen who had followed him they
stepped forward and seized hubert sal-
isbury who sagged limply within their
grasp

  im arresting you for murder de-
clared the sergeant

  all went black before hubert salis-

 shad-a

burys eyes the facts seemed all
against him innocent though he was
hubert salisbury knew that the burden
of this crime would be laid upon him

chapter x

ferret displays craft

  ferret nudged butcher as the two
men stole along the gravel path outside
the secluded home of roland delmar
the big man stopped

  hes in that room whispered fer-
ret indicating a lighted window on the
ground floor im going to watch
you stay here

  the window was partly opened ap-
proaching it ferret crouched in the
darkness then slowly raised his head
and peered within

  roland delmar was seated at a desk
his face haggard staring absently at the
wall

  while ferret watched the telephone
rang delmar arose eagerly from his
reverie and went to answer the call at
a table in the corner

  yes yes ferret heard him say
ah mr traver have you been able
to change your decision    what
is that     i see  

  his voice ended wearily as the banker
listened to the other speaker then a
fiery light came into delmars eyes-a
spark of antagonism

  i see your game traver he ex-
claimed you want me to go to the
wall youre going to ruin our bank
   no  i dont believe
you

  his sudden indignation died and he
became almost pleading in tone

  maybe im wrong mr traver he
said im very nervous-you must ex-
cuse my outburst but what am i to
do it means the end for me--

  a startled look appeared upon del-
mars face as he heard some subtle sug-
gestion

ytou mean that he demanded do


the shadow magazine

i understand you correctly you cant
mean-he was almost whispering-
you cant mean-but you may be
right-

  with an abrupt motion roland del-
mar hung up the telephone ferret
watching the old bankers profile was
astonished by the change and surge of
emotions that passed over it he won-
dered what happened

  one moment delmar seemed fuming
and defiant-another he became pitiful
in expression ferret could not under-
stand

  it was in one of his moments of
hopelessness that delmar walked to his
desk opened a drawer and removed a
revolver he stood dazed as he held
the weapon in his hand

  the banker stared into the muzzle
and made a gesture as though to raise
the gun to his head then with a fierce
ejaculation he brought the revolver
down upon the desk muttering to him-
self he strode about the room like a
warrior ferret still wondered

  a new mood seized delmar he be-
came calm and decided he sat down
at the desk and picked up pen and pa-
per ignoring the revolver he began
to write

  ferret edged away toward butcher
he whispered the news to the big man

  call judge he said tell him just
what i have told you-everything that
delmar has done since he called ill
keep watch

  ferret went back to the window
delmar was writing slowly but steadily
he finished a small sheet of paper and
laid it aside there was a rap at the
door carefully delmar laid several
sheets of paper over the revolver

  come in he said

  a girl entered the room ferret
recognized her as martha delmar the
daughter of the old bank president
ferret had often seen her in middle-
town tall trim and attractive the

girl bore a marked resemblance to her
widowed father

  when she entered the room martha
was wearing a coat and hat ferret
dropped away from the window and
crouched in the darkness listening

  whats the trouble daddy came
the girls voice

  trouble roland delmar laughed
nervously nothing darling noth-
ing

  ferret peered through the window
and saw martha studying her father
with a worried air

  i was going out the girl said but
if you are not feeling well i can re-
main

  run along said delmar with a
wan smile dont worry martha
your old dad is all right

  martha came over to the desk and
kissed her father then she turned to-
ward the door and made a parting re-
mark

  i shall be home early

  as the girl left the room ferret
heard a sound beside him it was
butcher the man had made a tele-
phone call from a drug store down the
street and was back with his report he
drew ferret away from the window

  heres the lay he whispered
judge is clever he tried to put the
suicide idea into delmars noodle
thats why the old gent took out his
gun

  i get you said ferret

  but he didnt make a go of it con-
tinued butcher now hes worried
about what delmar is writing he
wants to get hold of it thats up to
you ferret

  leave it to me said ferret grimly

  the best stunt would be to plug the
old man now added butcher but
not unless it could be made to look like
suicide thats what judge told me

  besides that judge is waiting to
hear how major and deacon are mak-
ing out so heres the gag
the shadow magazine



  if the phone rings it means that all
is o k you can go the limit if it
doesnt ring in ten minutes try to get
the stuff hes writing anyway get
me

  i see judge is going to call here
when lie hears from the others-

  right 

  ferret sneaked back to the window
he saw delmar still writing now on
the second page the old man com-
pleted his work and carefully read over
the data he then laid the papers aside
with a sigh

  he uncovered the revolver and held
it in his hand thoughts of suicide were
beyond delmar now he looked at the
gun in contempt

  the telephone rang roland delmar
laid the revolver on the desk he went
to the table to answer the ring

  hello he said hello-whats
that    no    you must
have the wrong number  

  delmars back was toward the win-
dow and his attention was occupied
ferret recognized the signal

  the moment that he heard delmar
questioning ferret knew the call was
the fake one from judge it meant that
he could take any risk

  the papers were on the table the
revolver was beside them ferret went
through the window

  he was barely on the floor when
delmar turned seeing the invader
with his eyes toward the gun on the
desk the old man showed surprising
alacrity he sprang forward to grasp
the revolver but ferret beat him to the
weapon by a foot

  delmar slipping swung wide with
one hand while the other sought to
catch ferrets arm

  the two men were almost upon one
another as delmars head came for-
ward ferret with calculating skill
pressed the revolver close to delmars
temple and fired

  the bullet entered the bankers brain
roland delmar toppled to the floor
calmly ferret drew a handkerchief
from his pocket and wiped the handle
of the revolver he stepped around the
desk to where delmar was lying and
placed the gun in delmars outstretched
hand

  ferret did not forget the note which
delmar had written but instead of
seizing it and fleeing the crafty little
man deliberately pushed the papers side
by side upon the table and quickly read
the writing

  on the first page ferret read this
accusation

  to the state bank examiner

    the affairs of the county national
  bank have reached their present precari-
  ous situation because of a deliberate plot
  on the part o a man unfriendly to our
  institution

    i accuse david traver president of the
  middletown trust company of having
  furthered this plot i positively believe
  that the strange removal ofunds from
  our institution is connect  with the
  scheme to ruin the county i itional bank

    i am sending you this letter so that
  you may have full information in advance
  because of my inability to prevent the
  terrible crisis which is now impend-
  ing-

  the letter was continued on the sec-
ond page ferret picked up the incom-
plete sentence and read as follows

  i have contemplated suicide and even now
  am not sure that i can withhold my de-
  sire to end my own life my pride sus-
  tains me but it may weaken

    it may be that the county national
  bank has been robbed by some employee
  in whom we have placed mistaken trust

    i have not neglected my duty on this
  point through mr wellington the in-
  vestigator and mr salisbury my chief
  cashier i have sought to learn the truth
  of the matter roland delmar

  butcher was hissing from the win-
dow it was time to be going the
big man could not understand why fer-
ret was tarrying there was a servant


the shadow magazine

on the third floor of the house and the
shot must have been heard

  come along exclaimcd butcher in
a low voice grab those papers

  ferret picked up one sheet he
hastened to the window and sprang out
to join butcher together they scur-
ried across the dry lawn and scrambled
over a fence

 what were you waiting for
growled butcher

  i was reading the old mans let-
ter replied ferret

  why read it  youve got it havent
you 

  part of it

  butcher stopped with a low ejacula-
tion

  what you left some of it-

  i brought the first page with me
said ferret calmly there were two
pages i left the second

  we cant go back growled butcher
angrily now youve done it fer-
ret 

  yes ive done it said the crafty
slayer ive left a paper with delmars
own signature-in his writing-saying
that he was going to bump himself
off

  butchers growl turned to a gasp of
admiration

  you did that ferret

  i did was the reply wait un-
til judge sees the page i took wait
until he hears what was on the other
sheet

  ferret was chuckling as they reached
a car which they had parked some
blocks from roland delmars home he
had done this job as well as judge him-
self could have done it

  roland delmar was dead-and the
written sheet upon his desk would bear
testimony to the evidence that the old
banker had slain himself

  more than that it seemed to place the
blame for the troubles of the county
national bank upon some unknown
member of his own organization

chapter xi

 - the bank crash

  the middletown newspapers were
splashed with glaring headlines sen-
sational developments in the affairs of
the county national bank were of tre-
mendous importance in the entire re-
gion

  on the same night that roland del-
mar the president of the institution had
committed suicide hubert salisbury
the chief cashier had slain the investi-
gator who was seeking to learn the
cause of disappearing funds

  the link between the actions of the
president and the teller was found in
delmars note that sentence it may
be that the county national bank has
been robbed by some employee in whom
we have placed mistaken trust was
damning in itself

  the fact that delmars statement
added that salisbury was working with
wellington was taken as further proof
of salisburys falsity

  it seemed obvious that salisbury had
slain wellington because the investiga-
tor knew too much the very circum-
stances of the killing bore that out sal-
isburys story was thin yet he per-
sisted in it

  the local police were quizzing him
and were doing their best trying to
break down his statement

  it seemed doubtful that salisbury had
premeditated his crime more than
likely wellington had mentioned some-
thing that had shown salisbury his
thefts would be uncovered if the in-
vestigator remained alive so he had
slain wellington in cold blood

  the startling revelation that the
county national had lost a large
amount of money brought a surge of
excited depositors to the doors of the
bank and all its branches the bank
officials declared that the institution was
sound and could meet its obligations
but under the circumstances they could
the shadow magazine



gain no financial aid in time to avert
the run

  so heavy were the withdrawals that
every one expected the institution to
close its doors yet for a while the
county national held out amazingly
well it called in all funds and paid
off depositors in full

  one hope was support from harvey
bronlon had the feudal lord of the
territory come to the aid of the stricken
bank withdrawals might have stopped
but bronlon refused to help

  with that announcement two days
after the trouble had begun the county
national closed its doors its branches
crashed with it and the lesser institu-
tions dependent upon the central bank
failed also

  it had required a total lack of con-
fidence to accomplish this for a great
percentage of the depositors had been
paid in full before the doors were closed

  the middletown trust company was
the only bank left in the entire region
those who had saved their money from
the county national crash were waver-
ing then with a general rush they
began to deposit their money in the
trust company

  at the same time doubtful persons
were withdrawing their money the
volume of business was tremendous
ferret and butcher were deluged with
work at the tellers windows major
was busy at his job and over all the
benign countenance of judge was there
to promote confidence

  the gray-haired bank president an-
nounced emphatically that deposits were
exceeding withdrawals and upon the
heels of this announcement harvey
bronlon declared that he had complete
confidence in the affairs of the institu-
tion

  this brought the situation under con-
trol the people who crowded the trust
companys office were there to put in
money-not to take it out

  for middletown was a most prosper-
ous community and the crash of its
oldest bank was laid directly to the
fact that many thousands of dollars had
been taken from its treasury hubert
salisbury was denounced as the culprit
the police tried to force a confession
from him

  thus did middletown enter into the
most exciting period of its history when
the great bubble of expansion and in-
dustrial development threatened to
burst with the collapse of the staid old
county national bank

  but the inexhaustible funds of the
middletown trust company proved well
that this newer institution was capable
of serving the needs of the district

  it was during the first days of re-
adjustment that a gentleman named
henry arnaud registered at the darth-
more hotel the huge modern structure
that had been financed by harvey bron-
lon there were many visitors to mid-
dletown and this man was merely an-
other guest at the new hotel

  yet henry arnaud was of unusual
appearance tall quiet of demeanor
and deliberate in action he wore a
countenance that never changed in its
expression

  on the day of his arrival in mid-
dletown he might have been seen watch-
ing the crowds surging into the county
national bank which was destined to
close its doors shortly afterward

  two days later henry arnaud ap-
peared among the throng of persons who
were transacting business at the middle-
town trust company there he pre-
sented a travelers check of one hun-
dred dollars denomination ferret was
the man at the window and while the
teller was comparing the signatures on
the check henry arnaud watched him
with piercing eyes

  as ferret looked up henry arnauds
keen gaze faded ferret saw nothing
surprising in his appearance

  all right mr arnaud he said


the shadow magazine

glad to cash this for you will you
be in middletown long

  i expect to be here for several
weeks replied arnaud

  glad you will be with us a while
said the teller pleasantly come in
any time consider this your bank
while you are here how will you have
the money 

  a fifty a twenty and the rest in
tens suggested arnaud

  ferret counted out the amount ar-
naud walked away from the window
then turned back he noted that ferret
was busy with another customer and
that a line had formed by the window
so arnaud stepped into the shorter line
by butchers window

  let me have change for this ten
please he said to the second teller a
five and five ones-

  butcher complied with the request
he started to place the ten-dollar bill
at the left of the window then swung
his hand over to the right and dropped
it there

  pocketing his money henry arnaud
strolled from  the bank he walked
leisurely along the block studying his
surroundings he came to the down-
town comer and turned up the side
street stopping to look in different win-
dows

  his slow purposeless gait eventually
brought him to the funeral parlor

 here henry arnaud chanced to
glance up in the window he saw the
tall mournful form of deacon garbed
in his habitual black

  deacon was staring out into the
street as henry arnaud gazed at the
new undertaker the eyes of the two
met

  each studied the other momentarily
with expressionless face then henry
arnaud strolled onward and the brief
meeting ended it was scarcely more
than a passing glance yet each of the
participants retained an indelible im-

pression of the visage that he had just
seen

  deacons face clouded it became
more solemn than before his eyes
staring across the street visualized the
countenance that he had seen

  instinctively deacon was wondering
about that passing stranger he won-
dered what the impressive visitors pur-
pose was here in middletown

  the faint trace of a smile appeared
upon the thin straight lips of henry
arnaud as the tall figure stopped before
another window he was picturing the
face of deacon

  the chance encounter was of vital
moment to each man not a word had
been spoken not a sign given still
two keen intellects had been at work

  deacon looked the part of an under-
taker to perfection nevertheless ar-
naud had suspected some other reason
for his presence here arnaud in turn
had all the appearance of a chance
passer-by yet deacon had seen a dou-
ble purpose in his approach

  returning to the darthmore hotel
henry arnaud purchased copies of the
evening newspapers he retired to his
room and looked from the window sur-
veying the main street of middletown
his gaze wandered over the city and
he seemed to be locating certain spots
for future interest

  seating himself arnaud began a
study of the newspapers they told of
the latest developments in the financial
crash of the county national bank

  henry arnaud finished his reading
produced a small pair of scissors and
carefully cut out the latest clippings
he added them to a pile of other items
that he took from an envelope in his
pocket

  the entire collection formed a com-
plete history of recent events in mid-
dletown arnaud quietly reread the ac-
count of the murder in the bank

  he noted the sensational story of
roland delmars death with h was a
the shadow magazine



facsimile reproduction of the note that
had been found upon the bankers table

  this henry arnaud laid to one side
he studied it again then stared from
the window his keen eyes seemed to
be weaving their way through the
buildings that lay below seeking- to learn
secrets hidden within solid walls

  from his pocket arnaud took a wal-
let he extracted a wad of bills it
was not a thick packet but as the man
laid each bill aside in turn the value of
the fund became apparent

  the first bill in henry arnauds bank
roll was a gold certificate of ten-thou-
sand-dollar denomination then came
a second and a third five thousand-
dollar bills followed then a dozen inter-
mingled hundreds and fifties

  arnaud drew a few of the latter from
the mass and replaced the rest in his
wallet he counted the amount that he
had retained-five hundred and fifty
dollars in all he thrust these bills in
his vest pocket as one would deal with
small change

  now he brought forth the modest
sum that he had obtained at the bank
he counted this money carefully a
fifty a twenty two tens a five and
five ones

  after making a note of the serial

numbers he rolled the crisp notes and
slipped them in another pocket of his
vest

  again henry arnauds eyes were
peering from the window he was en-
grossed in thought and as he stared a
soft laugh echoed from his lips it was
a strange weird laugh

  arnauds left hand was resting on
the window sill upon a finger glim-
mered an ever-changing gem-a trans-
lucent stone of fading and renewing
hues it was a rare girasol-unmatched
in all the world

  had deacon heard that laugh had
he been here to note that sparkling mys-
terious jewel his suspicions would have
been justified he would have known

with certainty that henry arnaud was
indeed one whose presence he might
well fear

  for henry arnaud was the
shadow

chapter xii

the shadow hears

  the middletown trust company had
proven its stability in recognition of
that fact a grand testimonial dinner was
in progress at the darthmore hotel

  listed as the guests of honor were
david traver and harvey bronlon
these two worthies were seated at the
head -table all during the banquet
judge smiling and confident had been
talking to bronlon whose heavy over-
bearing countenance had shown re-
sponsiveness

   even now as the speaker was intro-
ducing judge as david traver harvey
bronlon was nodding in commendation
of something that judge had said

  standing judge smiled benignly as
those present rose to their feet and
joined in a tumultuous outburst of ap-
plause

  when the wave of enthusiasm had
ended the throng sat down judge in
a quiet easy voice beganhis speech

   as he warmed to his topic there was
breathless interest judge was swaying
this crowd bending all before him
nods and murmurs of agreement
greeted his statements

  and now gentlemen he said in
conclusion i am going to mention
two incidents that may remain with
you as a lasting impression this morn-
ing a certain gentleman-j udge paused
and glanced toward bronlon-entered
my office and stated that he was ready
to deposit drafts on new york banks
to the amount of three hundred and
fifty thousand dollars

  here applause commenced handclap-
ping burst forth everywhere judge
still smiling waved his hand toward
bronlon and the uproar increased at


the shadow magazine

last it ended as judge raised his hand
for silence

  then said judge the same gen-
tleman told me that he had changed his
plans about the distribution of a bonus
to his employees he said that he had
intended to deliver the bonus within the
next few weeks but he had now de-
cided to wait for another month at least
so that he might draw the money from
an outside source and thereby keep as
much money in middletown as pos-
sible

  applause began again but subsided
instantly as judge raised his hand for
silence

  perhaps said the gray-haired man
you would be interested to know what
i replied to-mr bronlon i said ex-
actly this the middletown trust
company is an institution that serves
middletown it has gained the confi-
dence of the citizens and it will always
retain that confidence our resources
are such mr bronlon that i would sug-
gest you pay the bonus now pay it to
people who live in middletown with
money drawn from the one bank in
middletown 

  a marked stillness hung over the
room while judge waited for the effect
of his words to be fully impressed
upon the listeners

  as a result judge declared i
am pleased to say that to-morrow the
bonus money goes out with mr bron-
lons pay roll it is a yearly bonus gen-
tlemen

  let me add that should mr bronlon
care to draw ten times the amount of
that bonus money the middletown
trust company would be pleased to sup-
ply him with it

  the diners were on their feet shout-
ing their approval judge stood ac-
knowledging the storm of praise cries
came for bronlon

  the manufacturer rose to his feet
new applause burst forth and when

bronlon extended his hand for judge
to grasp the wild enthusiasts leaped
upon their chairs in mad approval

  it was half an hour afterward when
judge finally managed to shake himself
free of the last admirer he made the
plea that he was tired that he was stay-
ing at the hotel for the night he
reached the lobby and started toward
the elevator

  on the way he encountered one more
man howard best the undertaker
shook hands with david traver presi-
dent of the middletown trust company
deacon and judge they called them-
selves on occasion-but not during this
public exchange of greetings

  as judge entered the elevator he
slipped his hand in his pocket-the same
right hand that had just been clasped
by deacon before the door of the ele-
vator closed some one stepped into
view from an obscure corner of the
lobby and entered the car also it was
henry arnaud

  judge stepped off at the fourth floor
henry arnaud continued upward he
left the elevator and went to his room
there he opened a suitcase then ex-
tinguished the light

  the dim glow from the street lights
below was not sufficient to reveal his
form henry arnaud was invisible in
the darkness and singularly enough
there was no audible token of his pres-
ence except a faint swish that lasted
for only a few seconds

  the door of the room opened noise-
lessly the light from the hall was
blotted out then the door closed
blackness alone remained henry ar-
naud had become the shadow

  on the fourth floor judge had en-
tered a room alone but he had scarcely
closed the door before other men ap-
peared to join him

 major butcher and ferret had been
 waiting there they began a low and
 eager discussion there was no chance
 of being overheard for this room was
the shadow magazine



 the center of a suite and judge had
 entered it through a short inner hall

   great work judge congratulated
 major great work you pulled it
 over swell

   i knew i would get them from the
 start responded judge i saw the
 way you fellows were taking it how
 did you like that handshake with bron-
 lon at the finish

   a knock-out said ferret

   the best part judge said butcher
 was the way you worded it about
 bronlon and his bank drafts if you
 should be questioned about that you
 can go back to your statement bron-
 lon offered to put in the money-thats
 all you said

   of course declared judge you
 know this bonus proposition has been
 the one thing weve had to worry about
 the state examiner has been letting us
 alone because we were doing so well

   he was there to-night-i talked with
 him afterward-and he took the bait
 better than any of them he left town
 after the banquet convinced and satis-
 fied

   so were all set now ferret ex-
 ulted

   the bonus declared judge will
 account for just about all that we can
 take there will be profits after this-
 but we are going to be working in a
 circle its going to be a question now
 of easing ourselves out of the picture
 how will you work it judge
 asked butcher

   i think said judge that it will not
 be long before david traver will re-
 ceive an offer to assume the presidency
 of a prominent eastern bank so at-
 tractive an offer that he will be forced
 to resign-much against his will-the
 position which he holds here in mid-
 dletown

   you think you can work it through
 bronlon asked major

   certainly replied judge in the

   meantime the expansion of the mid-
 dletown trust company with the estab-
 lishment of branches to replace those
 of the defunct county national bank
 will mean a shifting of cashier and tell-
 ers their departure will be unnoticed
 theres going to be a blow-off some
 day said butcher in a worried tone

those numbers-

  certainly said judge sagely but
it will be long deferred when it ar-
rives the successor of david traver
will be the one who is holding the bag
you know how these discoveries are
they always set them closer than the
time they actually happened

  right agreed major

  ferret shifted uneasily in his chair
he was glancing toward the little hall-
way that led to the outer door butcher
noted his action

  whats the matter ferret  he
asked

  thought i saw something said the
stoop-shouldered man it looked like
a gleam there in the little hall

  too much bill counting declared
butcher seriously ive gone goggle-
eyed this past week guess its getting
ferret too

  ferret was moving back into his chair
he was grinning at butchers remark
it made light of his alarm

  all right said judge quietly set-
tle down now and listen things look
normal so we will start the carry on
saturday night handle the bulk then
-maybe some on sunday the rest
can wait a week

  in case its needed in the meantime
observed major

  yes continued judge with a nod
deacon is ready he has been using
the hearse nights disposing of those old
coffins he put up for sale he has sold
only a few of them-it is a wonder he
has managed to do that with the high
prices he is asking

  yes observed major its odd
how a little detail like that can make


the shadow magazine

 trouble i was talking to deacon about
 it the other night he had to dodge a
 couple of customers i think he has
 about half a dozen left not counting
 those he sold to bronlon-which he
 hasnt delivered yet 

   baron bronlon declared judge
 with a slight smile thinks of the wel-
 fare of his subjects-even to the point
 of buying coffins at a bargain price so
 that they can get them at cost when they
 die he certainly rules this part of the
 country

   which suits us perfectly said
 major

   now that is settled resumed judge
 with the air of a chairman at a meeting
 are there any other matters

   yes said butcher look at this
 came out in the final edition to-night
 i hope it doesnt get in the morning
 newspapers

   he picked up a newspaper from a
 table in the corner and pointed out an
 item near the bottom of the first page

   hm-m-m said major the girls
 trying to make trouble

   he took the newspaper from butch-
 ers hands folded it carefully and
pointed to the heading

fiance innocent miss delmar
claims

   read it suggested judge

   major read

     declaring that hubert salisbury held
   for the murder of h j wellington is
   innocent of any crime martha delmar
   has announced that she will fight against
   his conviction to the finish the girl
   now living alone in the home where her
   father died stated her intention this after-
   noon

     the evidence against hubert is cir-
   cumstantial said miss delmar the po-
   lice have made no effort to get at the
   truth of the killing if they would look
   for further clews they might find proof
   that hubert is innocent

     miss delmar added that she cannot ex-
   plain her fathers suicide she declared
   that she was present while he was writing

  the note found on his desk beside his dead
  body at that time he appeared to be
  tired but not morose according to miss
  delmar

    in addition to these statements miss
  delmar claimed that the police had re-
  fused to let her call in the aid of out-
  side investigators in connection with the
  wellington murder she appeared to be
  indignant over the matter

      i intend to press an investigation was
  her final statement i want to uncover
  the real murderer i have addressed an
  appeal to the shadow hoping that he
  will aid me in this work but have been
  unable to learn where he can be
  reached 

  the shadow questioned butcher
who is he

  some fellow supposed to be in new
york replied major with a short
laugh they say he knows all about
the gangsters and fights them with their
own methods the girl is crazy thats
all shed better wait until christmas
and send a letter to santa claus
ferret and butcher joined in the
laugh judge however seemed serious

  its no laughing matter he as-
serted the girl offers no evidence
but she is on the right track dont
forget that we must not belittle any-
thing that may mean danger

 but this talk about the shadow

- protested major

  it may be fact said judge seri-
ously i am not surprised that you
three have not heard of the shadow
but i have he has created quite a stir
within the past few years while you
were away

  he operates chiefly in new york
but his name was suggested in connec-
tion with a big clean-up that took place
in chicago middletown is a long way
from new york however i dont
think we have much to worry about
here-

  he suddenly thought of his meeting
with deacon in the lobby reaching in
his pocket judge extracted a folded
the shadow magazine



sheet of paper the others watched him
as he opened and read it

  deacon slipped this to me an-
nounced judge look at it

  he handed the paper to major who
held it so that butcher and ferret could
also peruse the writing

 watch out for a man named
henry arnaudwere the words he
is staying at the darthmore looks
suspicious have seen him twice and
found out his name to-night

  ferret was so intent in scanning the
message from deacon that he forgot
all about the darkened hallway by the
door he had been looking in that di-
rection every few minutes

  had he glanced there now he would
have seen the door open slowly and
then close again but the action was
silent and passed unnoticed

  what will we do about it asked
butcher

  well said judge ill leave that
to major you three are going out
shortly call the hotel from a pay sta-
tion major ask for the number of
henry arnauds room get that for
a start

  right said major ill start along
in a few minutes

  this is more tangible than the
shadow declared judge deacon is
shrewd he sees much but says little
he is handicapped at present it
would be unwise for him to check
on this man arnaud and he knows it

  twenty minutes later major stopped
in a drug store near the hotel and
called the darthmore he smiled as he
heard the clerks reply a minute later
major met ferret and butcher outside
the store

  we can forget that fellow arnaud
he said he checked out nearly half
an hour ago leaving town on the bus
to catch the eastern limited he had
his ticket with him-the clerk said he
might be reached in cleveland thats
where hes going

  the three men parted each had
the same thought deacon and judge
shrewd though they might be were
overapprehensive deacon was worried
about henry arnaud judge was con-
cerned about the shadow

  why worry  arnaud had gone from
middletown the shadow had not
come to the city thus reasoned the
three

  they were wrong little did they
suspect that henry arnaud and the
shadow were one person-who was in
middletown that night

  henry arnaud had gone because the
shadow had heard

chapter xiii

the shadow speaks

  it was midnight martha delmar
was alone in her boudoir reclining in
an easy-chair she was trying to read
a book the effort proved unsuccess-
ful she laid the book aside and her
eyes wandered to the table where two
framed pictures stood

   one was a photograph of her father
the other of her fiance roland delmar
was dead hubert salisbury was in
jail awaiting trial on charges of rob-
bery and murder

  marthas face was sad but as she
stared tearfully at the pictures a look
of defiance came over her countenance

   she had suffered much this girl since
that tragic night every friend in the
world had deserted her even her re-
lations-all distant cousins-had ignored
her the rich of middletown had felt
the failure of the county national
bank in retaliation they had ostra-
cised martha delmar from their society

  two reasons alone kept this brave
girl in middletown one was the recol-
lection of her father the knowledge
that he was innocent of any wrong the
other was the plight of her lover for
hubert salisbury had  friend beside
herself


the shadow magazine

  bitter thoughts surged through the
girls mind strongest of all-for it
was most recent-was the thought of
her foolhardiness in giving an interview
that afternoon a reporter had baited
her that she might express her bitter-
ness for all the town to read

  why had she revealed her secret
thoughts martha chided herself for
the great mistake she thought of her
wild appeal-her statement that she
was anxious to call upon the shadow
for aid

  the shadow on her last trip east
martha had heard of that mysterious
man she had heard his voice in fact
over the radio but like most of the
public she had merely supposed that
she had been listening to an actor

  yet the voice had haunted her and
when people had talked of the shadow
martha had listened they told amazing
stories of the shadow-a personage
clad in black as dark as the night itself
who matched the guns of criminals with
the sword of justice-who triumphed
over the hordes of gangland

  she recalled a small adventure in new
york on the outskirts of greenwich
village a man had accosted her and
had tried to seize her pocketbook her
cries had brought another man on the
run

  if the shadow were only here in
middletown martha sighed as she
realized the hopelessness pf that wish
the shadow could not be everywhere
superman though he might be

  how could she expect him to come
here even though great crime might
be rampant his great work lay in
new york

  perhaps the shadow might lend ear
to her plea if she could only reach him
but that lone paragraph printed only a
few hours ago would go no farther
than the region about middletown it
would bring her only ridicule-not the
help for which she longed

  martha sighed wearily she was
very tired but she could not sleep be-
cause of worry she extinguished the
reading lamp and the room was dim
except for the glow of a single shaded
lamp in a far corner martha lay her
head against the back of the chair and
turned her half-closed eyes toward the
open door

  her eyes opened wide and a sud-
den chill swept over her yet in that
sudden qualm she was unable to make a
motion or resort to a single cry

  standing in the doorway was a tall
figure clad in black his long cloak
was flowing from his shoulders a
slight fold revealed a dash of its crim-
son lining his head was bent forward
and his face was invisible for he wore
a broad-brimmed slouch hat turned
down over his eyes

  yet martha fancied that she could
see the eyes-glowing burning eyes that
gleamed from strange featureless
depths the girl shuddered who was
this strange apparition

  then came amazing revelation one
name surged into marthas mind
whether this personage was actual or
a being of her imagination there was
but one who he could be

  the shadow

  unconsciously marthas lips formed
the name her unspoken words could
not escape the keen eyes that watched
her a low-whispered voice responded
it came from under the huge black hat

  yes i am the shadow

  martha breathed a sigh of relief the
whole fantastic situation became real
she felt no fear the presence of this
unknown master of the dark inspired
confidence the girl knew that she had
found a friend

  i have tried to seek you she said
quietly but i did not know where
you could be found

  i am found where i am needed
responded the sibilant voice

  i have need of your help declared
the shadow magazine



martha beseechingly i have great
need you know what has happened-
here in middletown

  i know

  the man i love-the girls voice
broke-is under arrest-for murder
he is innocent came the shadows
words

  my father continued martha is
dead he-he was a suicide

  he was murdered

  the shadows calm emphatic tone
made the girl sit up in her chair wild-
eyed she stared questioningly toward
the black-robed figure in the doorway

  slowly the shadow
advanced until he
stood in the center
of the room tall and
imposing his arms
folded before his body

  you must not fear
the truth he de-
clared in a low even
monotone i cannot
change the past i can
control the present i
can alter the future

  martha nodded in
understanding

  your father wrote
a note before he died
said the shadow

  yes replied martha i have it-
here

  let me see it

  the girl arose she felt no fear the
presence of the shadow was a realiza-
tion of her hopes she went to the dress-
ing table opened the drawer and
brought out a sheet of paper

  she turned directly toward the
shadow and approached him she was
almost face to face with the apparition
in black when she stopped still she
could not see that hidden countenance

  a black-gloved hand came slowly for-
ward it took the paper from marthas
hand the girl saw the gleam of the
shadows eyes he returned the paper

  i have seen a copy the shadow
said it tallies with the original

  it was written by my father said
the girl they say it proves he was a

suicide-

  it proves that he was slain de-
clared the whispered voice

  martha sat down in the chair and
looked at the paper the shadow spoke
his words a virtual answer to the ques-
tions that were running through the
girls mind

  the first paragraph declared the
shadow is not indented the second
paragraph is yet the
writing shows care
and method it proves
that this is only part
of your fathers mes-
sage it is the last
page the first sen-
tence is the continua-
tion of a paragraph
that began on the page
before

  martha read the
words i have con-
templated suicide-
and realized instantly
that the shadow had
struck the vital point
 there was at least
one other page continued the shadow
only this one was found some one
took the remainder of the message he
wanted the death to be declared suicide
-to cover murder

  martha delmar nodded strangely
enough she had recovered quickly from
the shock of learning that her father
had been murdered the thought of
suicide had wounded her the fact that
roland delmar had actually resolved to
live came as a comforting thought

  there have been two crimes in mid-
dletown said the shadow i am
speaking now of murder those re-
sponsible for your fathers death are
the ones who also killed wellington and

  harvey bronlon in-
dustrial giant of his neighbor-
hood whose factories bring
wealth to many is he marked
to be the victim of the five
chameleons will he fall
into the trap


the shadow magazine

placed the blame upon hubert salis-
bury

  the voice paused thoughtfully

  but those are not the only crimes
murder was but incidental to the plot-
ting that has reached this city these
men of crime have not yet completed
their evil work i shall thwart them

  the voice was sinister its shudder-
ing tones awed the girl yet despite
the uncanniness of the scene she knew
that the shadow was a friend that
fact banished fear

  i shall turn their crimes against
them announced the shadow accent-
ing each word with sibilant emphasis
the truth shall be learned-and the
innocent shall not suffer

  martha could see the glowing eyes
she knew that the menacing glint was
only meant for the foes of justice to
her the eyes gleamed with warm friend-
liness

  be patient said the shadow
justice shall prevail

  the girl realized that the shadow
was about to leave she felt a sudden
panic-a fear that she would lose his
protecting influence

 you are going-

  yes

  you will return

  yes

  slowly the shadow drew the black
glove from his left hand to reveal the
long white fingers martha stared in
amazement at the resplendent gem
which she saw its marvelous changing
hues were reflected clearly even in the
dim light

  this girasol said the spectral voice
is the symbol of the shadow few
have ever known its significance you
are one

  he who wears this stone-like which
there is no other-is the shadow no
matter what his guise may be he is the
shadow tell none what i have told
you

  i understand said martha breath-

lessly i shall remember no one
else shall know

  as the girl stared at the gem she
lost all sense of material forms about
her the effect of the glowing jewel
was hypnotic

  the figure of the shadow seemed to
melt into darkness the white hand
disappeared only the changing girasol
with its hues of ultramarine and crim-
son sparkled before her eyes

  the impression was fading the
glorious gem was melting away martha
reached forward to clutch it her hands
closed on space as the colors no longer
remained

  the girl looked about her she was
alone in the room her eyes had re-
tained the impression of the wavering
colors and she had fancied that the
shadow had remained

  now all was like a dream only the
paper in her hand stood as proof of the
shadows presence had she imagined
the singular conversation which had
taken place

  it was possible that such was the
case yet martha could not dismiss the
semblance of reality

  she was sure that the shadow had
been in this very room she believed
that he would aid her she felt posi-
tive that he would return that soon
again she would see the mystic gem

chapter xiv

the shadow learns

  although the county national bank
had ended its career as an institution
there was still a great deal of necessary
work going on at the main office in
fact on this particular night workers
had been on hand until almost twelve
oclock

  now only the watchman remained
patroling his rounds in his usual slow
and methodical fashion there was
little chance that any one would at-
tempt to enter this defunct banking
house and the sluggishness of the
watchman indicated his tendency to-
ward mere routine

  high above the floor was a balcony
that extended around the outer edge of
the main room here were situated the
clerks working quarters a row of
adding machines bore testimony to the
size of the staff that had once worked
there a heavy grated door barred the
top of the stairway at the balcony

  hardly had the heavy tread of the
watchman died away before a tiny light
appeared upon the balcony the light
shone near a corner and it indicated
that some one had entered one of the
balcony windows that opened upon a
narrow alleyway at the side of the bank

  the entire balcony was grated and
the top of the grating ran along a series
of crossbeams the light climbed up-
ward along the grating it went out as
an invisible figure squeezed itself be-
tween two beams then the unseen
prowler descended the grating until he
hung suspended above the floor of the
banking room

  there was a dull plop as the invisible
form dropped lightly from the balcony
the light reappeared for an instant
then vanished

-the shadow was in the county na-
tional bank

  the only token of the mysterious
ones presence was the occasional flicker

of the light which appeared unexpect-
edly in various places the keenest
listener could not have trailed the prog-
ress of the shadow

  his light showed in the little office
where hubert salisbury had talked
with wellington it beamed upon the
huge vault and the shadows black-
gloved hand appeared before it the
entire floor was subjected to a thorough
inspection

  the watchman going on his rounds
heard nothing that attracted his atten-
tion when he approached the light
went out and all was still within the
large room

  at last the light appeared downstairs
there it showed on the floor-on the
exact spot where wellington had been
found dead the light swept along the
walls

  when it again reappeared it was up-
stairs once more in salisburys little
office there beneath a tiny circle of
light a hand-no longer gloved-ap-
peared and began to write

   hubert salisbury-story correct

   wellington suspected truth-but did not
   know

  bank entered by careful plotters
  vault shows signs of expert work in open-
  ing it

  drawer in salisburys desk has been
  opened by a special key revolver re-
  moved evidently as a precaution for- the
  future

   only possible egress through room be-
   low man entered listened to conversa-
   tion between s and w murder com-
   mitted gun left

  the paper disappeared the light
went out a slight swish told that the
shadow was leaving the office again
his torch illuminated the downstairs
room there it began a thorough ex-
amination of the floor

  as clearly as if wellingtons body
had been lying there the shadow pic-
tured the scene when the investigator
had died his flashlight moved along
t

the shadow magazine

  the dusty floor looking for hidden
  clews

    it reached the side of the room where
  the grating of the safe-deposit com-
  partment made a corner with the wall
  itself there it gleamed upon a smooth
  solid panel

    this was the spot that the shadow
  sought all other portions of the wall
  were alike but here a broad panel was
  bisected by the last vertical bar of the
  grating

     the shadows light was on the floor
  and along the wall the hand now
  gloved tapped the panel it sought
  everywhere for some secret contrivance
  it found nothing but smooth surface

    the light went out the shadow was
  pondering in the midst of stygian
  gloom his intuitive mind had declared
  that there must be some entrance here

    wellington had hinted that fact sal-
  isbury had said but the police ridiculed
  the idea searchers had examined the
  room they had not even suspected
  anything amiss

    the shadow knew that something lay
  on the other side of that wall he was
  considering one fact was it possible
  that the only way of forcing this bar-
  rier lay from the other side

   a plausible possibility with no
  means of operating from this room no
 one could discover the opening but
 that also meant a disadvantage it
 meant that should any one enter here
 and close the way behind him he would
 have no means of exit

    a low eerie laugh sounded in the
  darkness the shadows light showed
  on the smooth panel then turned and
  shone upon the upright pickets of the
  metal barrier these were divided by
  a horizontal bar at the center

    the black hand gripped each lower
  post in turn starting with the wall and
  moving away after a short space it
  started backward along the upper tier

    these upright bars were square iin
  shape one set at a slight angle

twisted a trifle under the powerful
grasp hidden eyes observed that the
lower portion of the post-below the
horizontal rail-did not respond to the
twist the bar was in two sections

  carefully the shadows hand tried
the lower portion of the post it would
not twist nor would it move up or
down then the hand went back to the
upper portion and turned it so that it
was exactly squared with the lower

  the hand gripped the lower post and
pressed upward there was a response
the lower portion went up the bot-
tom part of the upper post was hollow
slightly larger-not enough to be no-
ticeable to the eye-it allowed reception
of the lower post

  what appeared to be a solid bar was
in reality two sections the upper must
be set just right in order that the lower
might operate the shadow had dis-
covered the subtle secret his action-
the short upward stroke-forced a
mechanism in the thick horizontal bar
the entire panel on the near side of
the grating swung inward from the bot-
tom

  it was suspended from a rod hinge
at the top so closely did it fit that even
a thin blade could not have pried be-
tween the edges of the secret door now
with the barrier swung loose the
shadow placed his hands against it and
drew it upward it was nothing but a
thin metal facing

  behind the panel the shadow dis-
covered a solid wall of stone this bar-
rier refused to budge the shadows
light pried everywhere

  from beneath his cloak the shadow
drew a long slender blade of steel it
glittered as the hand thrust it into a
crevice between the next panel and the
stone barrier the blade curled as the
hand used it to probe the thin space

  a click sounded the stone barrier
yielded to pressure it moved back-
ward the shadow was in a pwll
shad-a
the shadow magazxne

compartment he found a projection
on the inner side of the swinging panel
and pulled it firmly shut

  the glowing eyes observed a metal
bar that corresponded to the special
post on the grating in the outside room
the shadows light revealed a passage-
way he stepped beyond the stone
barrier and pushed the bulwark back
into its place

  then he discovered the barlike catch
which his probing blade had released
the whole scheme of entry was now
apparent

  the passageway had been built in the
foundations of the building its solid
stone wall had a removable section
which could be drawn backward in a
groovelike track in place with lock-
ing bar in position this portion of the
wall was unyielding

  even if the metal panels had been re-
moved from the downstairs room of
the bank no evidence would have been
uncovered to show the operation of the
stone wall it was an amazing con-
trivance of ingenuity yet simple be-
cause it had been built in with the
foundation

  where did the passage lead 

  the shadow took a straight path
through the dark into a veritable cata-
comb hollowed in the very base of the
building that formed this modern city
block the passage ended in a stone
barrier many yards away from the
opening leading into the county na-
tional bank

  here the shadow in total darkness
found a portion of stone wall that drew
backward his hands prying here and
there discovered a catch that operated
another panel

  quietly the shadow slipped through
the opening he waited in silence for
a few minutes then turned on the rays
of the torch

  he was in the basement of the mid-
dletown undertaking establishment-a
room that could serve either as a storage
shad-a

place or a temporary morgue stacks
of coffins stood at the sides of the room
a large sliding door in the farther wall
denoted an entrance to another com-
partment

 the shadow laughed the sound
that emerged from his hidden lips filled
the air with a convulsive shiver that
stifled itself within the stone-walled
room

                       t

 the shadow was gone back the
way that he had come once more his
seeking light glimmered through the hol-
lowed passage he stopped at a spot
halfway along the lengthy corridor
here he found another portion of the
wall that bore the features of a secret
exit

  the black-clad man drew back the
wall he discovered a panel similar to
the one that he had used when he had
effected his first entrance into this
strange catacomb he pressed a lever
and made his way from the corridor
carefully closing the opening behind
him

  his flashlight guarded carefully
showed him that he had reached a down-
stairs room in the middletown trust
company it was similar to the room in
the county national bank

  but here there was no grating the
side of a doorway formed the edge of
the secret panel and the shadows keen
inspection soon found that the upper
molding of the doorway moved to the
left allowing the right side of the door-
way to move upward thus releasing the
panel in the wall

  with this knowledge at his disposal
the shadow extinguished his torch and
moved silently upstairs there was no
watchman prowling through the bank-
ing room satisfied that he would be
free from interruption the shadow re-
moved a black bag of tools from his
cloak

  he began to work upon the vault
as he progressed he seemed to dis-
the shadow magazine

cover certain peculiarities in its con-
struction it was not long before the
master hand completed its work the
vault stood open and the shadow en-
tered

  the tiny flashlight bobbing here and
there showed plainly that judge had
not exaggerated the resources of the
middletown trust company vast quan-
tities o bills of all denominations were
stacked in their proper places

  the shadow began a patient exam-
ination at times his light went out
and he remained silent in the steel-
walled cavern then his inspection be-
gan again

  in one compartment of the vault the
shadow discovered stacks of crisp new
bills he took- one bundle and slipped
it beneath his coat then he gave his
attention to another place where older
bills were bundled

  here the shadow discovered a few
certificates of one-thousand-dolfar de-
nomination he took some of these
and added others of five-hundred-dollar
denomination completing his extrac-
tion with notes of one-hundred-dollar
value he made up a total sum of thirty
thousand dollars

  directly upon the remainder of the
stack the shadow placed three bills
which he brought from his own pocket
-each a gold certificate for ten thou-
sand dollars

  a steely laugh sounded low within
the vault and the metal walls flung
back the sound as though they too were
laughing the figure in black emerged
and very softly closed the door of the
vault

  hundreds of thousands of dollars had
been at his disposal had the shadow
chosen to rob the vault he had taken
only a small quantity of new bills-a
petty trifling amount

  but he had used this opportunity to
provide himself with change for the
thirty thousand dollars that he had left
within the vault

  one more task remained on the
back of a deposit slip the shadow was
writing a brief message-using a foun-
tain pen he placed the written sheet
in a small envelope and reached through
one tellers window to drop the envelope
in a convenient spot

   the shadows soft laugh sounded
sibilant as the mysterious man made his
way back to the secret panel in the
room downstairs he opened it and
again reached the underground passage
he turned his steps toward the under-
taking establishment

  reaching the morgue in the cellar
the shadow went through the farther
door and stole upstairs until he stood in
the silent gloom of a funeral parlor
here he discovered a hall that led to a
rear door

  the door itself was double-locked
the shadow with the aid of an oddly
shaped key not only picked the locks
but relocked the door from the outside
after he had stepped into the alley

  here he stood in a blind driveway
into which hearses and delivery trucks
could be backed the alley was dark
and deserted the form of the shadow
was invisible as it moved toward the
street

  to-night the shadow had learned
the innermost secrets of the strange do-
ings which concerned five men in mid-
dletown-the five chameleons

  in all his actions he had been cau-
tious he could have departed leaving
no possible dew to the fact that he had
been within the walls and vault of the
middletown trust company

  yet the shadow had chosen to leave
signs of his visit he had taken a la-
beled pile of bills he had left notes
of large denomination in place of
smaller he had put a sealed envelope
where he knew it would surely be dis-
covered

  what was the purpose of these ac-
tions

  only the shadow knew

chapter xv

judge gives orders

  it was saturday morning business
was progressing nicely at the middle-
town trust company judge in his lux-
urious office was quietly reading the
newspaper accounts of last nights great
banquet

  major entered the office and judge
looked up maurice exton cashier
smiled at david traver president
major closed the door behind him the
two men were where no eavesdroppers
could possibly hear what their conversa-
tion was

  still reading the headlines eh
judge questioned major great
stuff all right

  i am just as much interested in the
absent news replied judge as in the
news that is present there wasnt
much space for anything but the ban-
quet  martha delmars statement was
not picked up by the morning newspa-
pers

  thats good

   stability said judge with a smile
that has been the keynote to-day i
have been watching the customers ma-
jor you have been busier than either
ferret or butcher

  tellers dont make loans grinned
major thats the cashiers job go-
ing great guns to-day judge cash go-
ing out-securities coming in thats
the racket from now on

  yes said judge thoughtfully its
very good youve been doing it well
major

  all short loans declared major
giving them more than they asked for
most of the borrowers were hit when
the county national crashed they
wont be able to make the grade when
the notes are due

   well have lots of securities to dis-
pose of agreed judge i think ill
send you to chicago major when the
time comes transform the stocks and

bonds into yellowbacks then bring
them here

  yellowbacks in-greenbacks out
said major with a smile

  exactly added judge that will
make it worth while during the waiting
period-when i am looking forward to
that eastern presidency

  its a marvel judge declared ma-
jor a phony gag to build up a gen-
uine reputation the greatest idea ever
-and its gone over in a big way
nodding judge glanced through the
glass partition and saw four men en-
tering the bank they were stalwart
fellows carrying revolvers in holsters
strapped to their sides

   bronlons special police said judge
come for the pay roll and the bonus
money i can see the armored car out
in the street your job majorv

   this transaction completed on a quiet
saturday was of tremendous size
bronlons weekly pay roll was a matter
of close to one hundred thousand dol-
lars including as it did pay rolls for
lesser businesses with which the great
financier was associated

  the armored car had called a week
before and had taken away that sum
for distribution now in addition the
bonus money was going out it
amounted to a months pay in all
nearly half a million in cash was to
leave in the custody of those four stal-
wart men

  yet this immense transaction was
merely a matter of routine stacks of
crisp bills were ready in the vault a
final check-up alone was necessary
judge went back to his newspaper

  when bronlons men were gone
major reappeared in judges office
wearing a troubled look judge glanced
questioningly at his subordinate
whats the matter he asked

  five hundred dollars short de-
clared major in a serious tone i
cant figure it i made it up with an-


the shadow magazine

other package of bills but it worries
 ff
me

  probably a mistake yesterday

  not a chance judge i dont make
mistakes that bronlon dough was
set-and i had all the packages checked
numerically one right out of the
middle

  judge shrugged his shoulders

  you can straighten it major he
said youve handled this perfectly
to date

 i know it responded major
thats why i dont like it right after
we close for the day im going to go
over everything if i find that packet
in with the other money i can
straighten all my figures but still i
wont like it

  we can stand a little adulteration
said judge with a smile

  sure declared major but its not
a good idea ive kept the scale ad-
justed to a hair until now im not
worrying about the amount-its the
fact that bothers me five dollars five
hundred or five thousand-its all the
same 

  ill go over things with you said
judge this is the final check-up
major to-night and to-morrow night
will change matters from then on your
job will be easy

  yes monday will put us where we
want to be

  major went away and judge occu-
pied himself with other matters twelve
oclock arrived the bank was closed
judge waited a while in his office
then arose to go in search of major
he met the straight-shouldered man at
his own door and major pushed him
back into the office

  look at these he exclaimed in a
low tone look judge look

  he placed three gold certificates in
judges hand the gray-haired man
stared at them in amazement each
was for ten thousand dollars

  where did you get these queried
judge in a tense tone

  in with the big bills declared ma-
jor i was checking on that five-hun-
dred-dollar error i looked among the
big bills first just to make sure that
the packet wasnt there i nearly
dropped dead when i saw these
judge

  is there a deficit-or too much

  no it tallies perfectly but
judge i didnt know there could be
one of these in middletown-unless
bronlon had it thirty thousand bucks
-in three perfectly good bills three
of them judge thats what knocks
me a ten-thousand-dollar bill com-
ing in through butcher or ferret would
be reported right away tell me-how
did these here bills get in with the big
notes 

  judge shook his head in perplexity

  we can use them he said but
i agree with you that it looks danger-
ous take it easy major go out
there quietly and bring ferret and
butcher in here just a little confer-
ence you know were closed for the
day and the clerks wont see anything
unusual about it

  major nodded and went away he
spoke to butcher and the big teller pre-
pared to visit the presidents office
major gave the same instructions to
ferret the stoop-shouldered man
nodded and waited idly in his cage in
no hurry to obey the order

  while he was standing there he noted
an envelope that lay upon the floor be-
side his stool he picked it up and
saw that it was sealed

  ferret was opening the envelope as
he walked across the floor to judges
office he entered the door and joined
the other three men he stopped short
as he saw the bills lying on judges desk

  ten grand each he exclaimed
where did those come from judge

  through a tellers window said
judge seriously butcher doesnt know
the shadow magazine

anything about them it is evident that
you never saw them before either
golly gasped ferret if i had

been handed one of those-

  he shook his head and pointed to
major indicating that the cashier would
have known about the matter immedi-
ately

  this beats me declared major
the only way i can figure it is that
some one got into the vault-last night
per-

  dont be absurd major responded
judge if any one had entered more
than five hundred dollars would be miss-
ing people dont crack vaults to leave
ten-thousarid-dollar bills

  the three men stood facing him all
bewildered judge smiled in a confident
manner

  dont worry he said this only
means that it would be unwise to wait
longer to-night you will all be here
finish the job then do not wait until
sunday everything goes out you
meet deacon first major tell him
about this then butcher and ferret
will arrive later

  everything out said major

  all but the securities corrected
judge they wait

  we still have a nice surplus said
major with a broad grin weve
got the cream but there will be milk
right along

  ferret losing interest in the turn
of conversation glanced at the envelope
in his hand he ripped it open and
drew out the folded deposit slip he
opened the piece of paper and stared
at the reverse said there in neatly
inscribed letters was this message

  you began too soon you should have
  forgotten daniel antrim your mistake
  has been made all plans are doomed to
  fail the shadow knows

  a startled exclamation came involun-
tarily from ferrets lips the stoop-

shouldered man realized his error the
others were staring at him

   ferret in alarm made a move to tear
 the sheet of paper but as he drew
 away major reached forward and
 plucked it from his hands glaring
 major held the paper for a moment
 then passed it to judge while he con-
 tinued to watch ferret

   listen judge ferret began turn-
 ing his head away from majors glare

 let me tell you-

   he leaned forward to point to the
 paper about to frame an explanation
 for the facts that it mentioned ferrets
 words died suddenly on his lips the
 sheet at which judge was staring was
 perfectly blank

   whats the idea questioned judge
 abruptly look at this major-you
 too butcher theres nothing here
 come clean ferret whats the mat-
 ter with you

   ferrets shrewdness served him well
 he could not understand why the writ-
 ing had vanished but the fact that it
 was gone gave him his chance he re-
 lied upon a half truth to serve him at
 this critical moment

   there was writing on it judge he
 said words written right there-on

 that piece of paper-

   what did it say demanded judge
 sternly

   it said something like this replied
 -fwt as though recalling the words
 something like this all your plans
 will fail the shadow knows thats
 exactly what it said judge

   the sincerity in ferrets eyes was
 convincing majors glower ceased
 these four had talked of the shadow
 last night yet ferret could not have
 brought up that name on the spur of
 the moment

   judge major and butcher thought
 alike all three knew that they in-
 dividually would have been startled had
 they read the words that ferret had just
 repeated aloud


the shadow magazine

  judge was holding the paper to the
light ferret was momentarily trou-
bled but judges inspection brought
no results no trace of the writing re-
mained judge placed the paper upon
the desk he looked from one man to
another

  there is a chance he declared
that some one of our group might plan
to double-cross the rest of us there
is always such a chance but i do not
consider it likely

  all of you have everything to lose
and nothing to gain there are games
in which one may profit at the expense
of others this game is not of that
type there are five chameleons-
and enough profit for fifty

  all nodded their agreement

  where did vou find that paper fer-
ret

  in this envelope was the reply on
the floor in the tellers cage

  judge examined the envelope care-
fully he placed it with the blank de-
posit slip

  unless you have lost your mind
ferret he said this note is significant
it means that there is a menace-close
by it means that some one has entered
here

  how much do you think he knows
questioned major anxiously

  very little replied judge sagely
if he knew much he would not reveal
himself he wants to make it appear
that he knows more he has tried to
work on ferret as a starter he has
too much to learn

  however we may expect danger to-
night be ready for it be sure when
you come that there is no one hidden
here use every precaution-at both
ends tell deacon major

  i shall be at harvey bronlons i
am relying upon you three-and dea-
con if any of you should suspect any-
thing be sure and let me know before
it is too late

  i think i see the scheme in back

of this some man-the one who calls
himself the shadow-wants to worry
us

  he lias worried me asserted ma-
jor hes started me thinking judge
im going to come out with it straight
im not accusing ferret of a double
cross all i think is that ferret has
been making some slip if he has let
him talk right now

  a shrewd gleam came into ferrets
eyes

  look here judge he said i see
it different theres only five of us
know this lay all right i get a phony
note its got me fooled you saw that
when i read it i swear i read what i
told you

  who sent that note well if you
want to know whats right in my mind
now ill tell you theres four people
who might have left it where id find it
im not accusing anybody either im
just telling you what might be

  judge sitting with folded hands
nodded wisely he studied ferret
closely then looked squarely at major
finally he glanced at butcher then he
raised his eyebrows and all knew that
he was considering deacon at last
judge spoke

  i see the game now he said em-
phatically it has worked so we will
end it already major suspects fer-
ret in turn ferret suspects some one
else-perhaps major butcher and i
have said nothing but we are won-
dering too

  you see the damage that has been
created we are five chameleons-
who have worked as one no one can
defeat our plans-except ourselves dis-
sension and mistrust can ruin us are
we going to let it

  not on your life exclaimed ma-
jor youve hit the spike square
judge put it there ferret

  major thrust his firm hand across the
desk and ferret seized it with a grin
the shadow magazine



butcher was nodding his approval all
suspicions had vanished judge beamed
approvingly

  be early to-night he said its
up to you three-and deacon forget
everything else work together

  all three nodded in agreement judge
dismissed them with a wave of his
hand the tension was ended there
might be danger for some unknown per-
son but they were ready for it

  when the three had left the office
judge sat alone he was thinking
hands still clasped of to-night he was
thinking of the shadow for judge
shrewdest of the five chameleons who
had adjusted themselves to extraor-
dinary circumstances was acknowl-
edging the shadow as a foe that did
exist

  sitting there in his office the perfect
picture of a bank president judge was
analyzing with the mind of a master
criminal

  what did the shadow know it did
not matter how much he knew if his
knowledge was merely sufficient to be
of use to him to-night there could be
but one wise course for him to take

  judges eye swept over the floor of
the banking room he studied the door
the windows the offices and the vault
his face gleamed and his thin lips
hardened in a curving smile

  judge had heard of the shadow-
the master who worked alone judge
too was a man who worked alone
these others were his tools

  the shadow was ready to match his
skill against five let him try to-
night 

  for these five chameleons were not
five of a kind in reality they were
four-and one

  the others were the four judge
was the one

  the shadow and judge one against
one

  but judge would have four to help
him

chapter xvi

the four prepare 

  major and deacon were together
standing in the melancholy room that
served as morgue and storeroom they
were conversing in low tones as they
discussed this evenings plans

  they were a rare pair these men
both were true chameleons major had
the bearing of an army officer he
played the part of a bank cashier to per-
fection he could bear himself with
distinction in any community

  deacon possessed a different type of
adaptability his habitual solemnity
was a part of him his ministerial air
his somber personality-both granted
him an immunity from suspicion he
filled his present role to perfection he
was the best funeral director middle-
town had ever had

  although the keen mind and per-
sonality of judge towered above these
men deacon and major as a com-
bination were virtually the equal of
their chief what one lacked the other
possessed

  where butcher relied upon bravado
and ferret upon intuition major and
deacon both excelled in cool delibera-
tion and resourcefulness they were
the ones who had engineered the su-
perb killing which had been laid upon
hubert salisbury

  ferret and butcher had disposed of
roland delmar effectively but ferret
had run into luck and he had succeeded
in spite of butcher in comparing the
two jobs both major and deacon felt
that they possessed a superiority over
the two lesser chameleons

  now in the basement of deacons
undertaking establishment they stood
in the dim light deacon with arms
folded major with his back braced
against a stack of new caskets deacon
was listening intently to majors dis-
course on the matter of the note which
ferret had received


the shadow magazine

  ferret is o k declared major
the question is-did he tell us all
that he saw on the note theres no
use bringing up the subject again id
just like to have your opinion thats
all

  deacon was thoughtful for a few
moments then he spoke in an ex-
pressionless tone

  judge is right he stated the
shadow-whoever he happens to be-
picked on ferret as the most susceptible
of our crew but judge overlooked one
important point and that makes me
agree with you-that ferret read some-
thing he hasnt told

  lets hear it deacon

  it seems very plain to me that
note was placed in ferrets cage the
shadow expected that he would find it
there and open it when alone when
the message faded ferret would be
puzzled

  ferret would say nothing-but he
would use his head the way the
shadow wanted he would form the
very opinion that he admitted he
would suspect that one of us-probably
yourself-had planted the message
there that would mean that one of
us-ferret-would be looking for a
double cross

  that sounds reasonable deacon
but the shadow evidently wanted
ferret to keep his thoughts to himself
that bears out your idea major there
was something in that message that fer-
ret hasnt told

  you think hed double-cross-

  easy major said deacon sooth-
ingly youre falling now ferret
wouldnt double-cross us he couldnt
but he has surely done something-
and that is why he became suspicious of
you

 he told you-

  ferret didnt tell me anything but
i remember the day we came into new
york you told ferret to head for
middletown with no byplay on the way

i believe that ferret ignored your ad-
vice 

  i see exclaimed major admiringly
he thinks that ive wised and am try-
ing to needle him

  you have the idea now but the
truth of the matter is probably that fer-
ret pulled something in new york the
evening that he was there the shadow
picked up the trail he found ferret
working in the bank so hes watch-

  yy

ing

  watching ferret

  possibly perhaps he is watching
the bank he must have been in there
last night he might have been clever
enough to get into the vault

  ah said major thats where he
was working on me playing me
against ferret trying to shake the
whole works i see it deacon i come
in and talk to judge i say theres
something phony ferret is called in
he has read the note and is keeping
mum when he hears my palaver he
thinks that im trying to hang some-
thing on him-

  thats the way it was intended
said deacon

  ferret is pretty dose to butcher
observed major thoughtfully

  and you and i are pretty thick
returned deacon

  which makes it announced major
a good scheme to split the brains and
the brawn of the five chameleons into
two factions ferret speaks his piece
to butcher i speak mine to you
right

  well that game is queered de-
clared major in a satisfied tone but
what i cant figure is why those big
bills were left there i see the idea
of the five hundred being gone that
may make trouble later but the switch

of the big bills-

  just to keep you guessing declared
deacon if you hadnt been so care-
ful in your accounts you wouldnt have
the shadow magazine



noticed the five-hundred matter if you
had seen those ten-thousand-dollar bills
first

  i guess youre right deacon

  i know im right said deacon in
a positive tone at the same time i
figure this shadow is still in the dark
he got into the bank-but i dont see
how he could have found our under-
ground channel if we run into any
trouble to-night its going to be in the
bank

  then you and i had better be to-
gether

  no declared deacon emphatically
ih have to be here ive got to be
ready for my delivery men its up to
you and ferret

  hm-m-m said major that
makes the shadows game look mighty
smooth you think id better take
ferret

  absolutely butcher is a big clown
hell be a good guard here but i
wouldnt have him sneaking into the
bank thats out of his line ferret is
a neat worker

  youre right deacon well so far
as im concerned ferret is o k i
dont care what he did in new york
it cant be changed now and weu have
to make the best of it

  as for ferret i know hes all
smoothed he spoke his piece to-day
and we shook hands so its all set

  with the campaign fully decided the
two men changed their subject

  judge will be up at bronlons de-
clared major youre sending out that
shipment of coffins to-night of course

  yes i told you the truck was com-
ing im sending some in the hearse
too

  well that puts judge at the other
end great since were doing two
nights work in one weu have to move
right along ferret and i will grab
the cash you and butcher can load it
then well separate ill see ferret and
butcher on monday-judge too

  and you can all stay away from
here thank you responded deacon
ill be glad to have it over the un-
dertaking business is getting too good to
suit me

  youre like me deacon laughed
major either one of us could do
good in a legitimate line but why try
it when theres a hundred thousand
apiece in this racket 

  maybe more observed deacon
yes agreed major judge is a
square shooter hes wise too hell be
sitting pretty after this is past ready
to hold down a real bank presidents
job

  deacon held up his hand for silence
some one was approaching through the
adjoining room a moment later
butcher and ferret came into the
morgue

  everything all right asked major
sure said butcher we locked
the door after us ferret was watching
he can spot anything

  weve arranged the system de-
clared major you and i work the
bank ferret

  a grin spread over ferrets face he
held no animosity toward major in
fact it was evident that ferret wanted
to establish himself in his companions
good graces ferret enjoyed all jobs
where stealth and cleverness were con-
cerned

  youll be on watch butcher con-
tinued major at this end deacon
will be with you

   ill stay in here

  no said deacon upstairs ill
be with you at first ferret can let us
know when he and major get back
then we can take turns stowing away
the goods some one has to keep on
the job upstairs i think it would be
best for me to pack you watch-and
tip me quick if the drivers come then
you can take my place while i stall with
them

 v

  all right agreed butcher

  ready then said major briskly
he glanced at his wrist watch its
eight oclock time to go

  the drivers will be here just before
nine said deacon

  just the right time responded ma-
jor

   in again out again laughed ferret

  all set the question came from
major

  the coffins first remarked dea-
con

  thats right said major come
on line them up

  butcher started toward a double stack
of polished coffins at one side of the
room he started to lift the end of
the uppermost casket

  psst hissed deacon not those
those are the new ones they did their
work the old ones are for to-night

  he indicated a stack of dusty coffins
at the other side of the room butcher
strode in that direction

  suits me he said with a grin
these are lighter those other babies
are tough ones

  he grasped one end of a coffin and
major took the other deacon and fer-
ret joined in the work soon a row
of caskets stretched across the floor
and deacon signaled that the work had
been completed

  come on said major to ferret

  the man of military bearing opened
the panel in the end of the room he
and ferret entered the passage major
lighting the way with a flashlight the
panel closed behind them

  all right said deacon

  butcher went through the door to-
ward the stairs deacon looked care-
fully about him he made sure that
everything was as he wanted it then
with an air of satisfaction he followed
the path that butcher had taken

  one minute went by then another
something moved at the side of the

room the top of one casket was
pushed slowly upward it was the very
coffin that butcher had started to lift
when deacon had stopped him

  the lid was balanced high now and a
figure was emerging from the casket
scarcely more distinct than a black spec-
ter the form slipped from its hiding
place a tall being stood beside the
pile of new caskets and gently lowered
the raised lid

  then the black form moved to the
center of the room he seemed like a
ghostly phantom in that dimly lighted
morgue the flowing cloak and the
slouch hat rendered him impenetrable

  it was the shadow

  noiselessly the black apparition
strode to the panel that blocked the
passage which major and ferret had
taken he opened the secret entrance
and stood there listening

  then his concealed lips emitted a
laugh that was both vague and mysteri-
ous it was a soundless mirthless tre-
mor-a peculiar guarded tone that
made the air reverberate yet did not
carry beyond the walls of that cellar
room

  the shadow stepped through the
panel it closed behind him his flash-
light flickered for a moment then went
out as he felt his way along the cor-
ridor

  hidden in the coffin the shadow had
anticipated this meeting through the
narrow slit between the casket and its
lid he had seen and heard he had
learned the plans for this evening and
his shrewd keen-thinking niind had
formulated a plan that would thwart
the game that was being played to-
night

  stowed away long before deacon and
major had met the shadows secret
presence had never been suspected he
had come from the dark of the coffin
he had entered the dark of the secret
corridor

  a few minutes after the panel had
the shadow magazine



closed behind the shadow deacon re-
turned to await his companions return
he had posted butcher and had decided
to stay downstairs

  ah was well deacon thought as he
stared solemnly about the room major
and ferret would do their job he was
ready here for once deacon per-
mitted a slight smile to spread upon
his lips

  deacon sensed no danger there was
none the menace of the shadow was
no longer in this morgue

  it had traveled after major and
ferret

  the shadow was at work

chapter xvii

judge keeps an appointment

  in the dimly lighted banking room
of the middletown trust company ma-
jor and ferret were at work together
they were removing stacks of bank notes
from the vault

  only the portion of the room close by
the vault was illuminated the two
men knew that they were safe from ob-
servation the lower windows of the
bank were closed with metal shutters
any glow of light that might be seen
from above would not attract suspicion
tor night work was not unusual in the
trust company

  there was a watchman on duty but
he was stationed at the outer door and
had not yet begun to make his rounds
there was a reason judge had chosen
the watchman and had gradually incul-
cated certain habits in the mans ac-
tions

  ferret was whispering a few gleeful
words to major as they continued their
work

  old jimmy the watchman he said
derisively sitting out there dead to
the world-deaf as they make them
judge certainly picked a swell bozo in
that guy

  hes only on a couple of nights a

week replied major a relief man
wliat you say works two ways it
means weve got to be on the lookout
its a night like this that some one
might try to get in here

  ferret made no reply he under-
stood the significance of the remark
major was making a guarded reference
to the shadow the suggestion brought
a remote suspicion into ferrets mind

  youre sure you looked every-
where questioned major cautiously

  everywhere said ferret as soon
as we came in you did some snooping
around the offices yourself if any one
is in this place he must be a midget i
didnt look in the wastebaskets
never mind the wisecracks re-
sponded major lets start this load
downstairs then you keep on ill dp
the relay work that leaves me in here
all the time

  the staircase was not thirty feet
away there was one small light burn-
ing in the room below but the stairs
themselves were dark reflecting no
light from above or below

  while ferret and major were com-
pleting their preliminary work a splotch
of blackness slowly emerged from the
stairway a long silhouette appeared
upon the marble wall it flitted into the
gloom beyond the range of the light by
the vault unobserved by either major
or ferret

  each man picked up a neatly ar-
ranged bundle of money the loads
were hoisted to their shoulders major
went first then ferret when the
stoop-shouldered man reached his com-
panion major pointed officiously to the
open panel

  slide along ferret he said walk-
ing toward the stairway take your
bundle and come back for mine ill
bring more down

  right said ferret

  when i get to the last ill wait for
you upstairs i want you to be there


the shadow magazine

when i close the vault well look it
over together and rearrange all thats
left

  right

  majors tone unconsciously a bit
louder than it should have been was
audible at the top of the stairs as well
as in the room below

  returning to the vault major con-
tinued to arrange the bundles he
strictly avoided certain packages the
work of rifling was confined to one por-
tion of the vault piles of crisp notes
on the right side were ignored

  major did not hurry in his work he
was checking bank-note numbers as he
proceeded every few minutes he
shouldered a new bundle and took it be-
low he had the short end of the re-
lay

  at last major stood back and sur-
veyed the interior of the vault he
rubbed his hands together with a satis-
fied air went to the head of the stairs
and listened he heard a slight noise
and tiptoed downward a few paces

  ferret major whispered

  right came the response

  the last loads down

  o k ill take it through

  tell deacon he can shove off
  right

  then come back to the vault

  several minutes later ferret appeared
and joined major at the door of the
vault the men began a low conversa-
tion they were staring toward the
vault as they spoke

  neither observed the tall gliding
shadow that was moving toward the
head of the steep stairs it merged
with the darkness just beneath the solid
paneled rail at the head of the stairs

  major was speaking to ferret and
his tones could be clearly heard from
the spot at the top of the steep steps

  how is deacon making out he
queried

  packing away answered ferret
butcher is down at the foot of the

stairs by the morgue he can hear any
noise from above and lies near enough
to talk to deacon

  have the drivers come 

  no they phoned told deacon
theyll be a little late

  did you tell deacon wed be there
yes he said to be careful as
soon as the men show up hes going to
stow butcher away lhen the drivers
will carry up the caskets deacon is
going along with them to see that they
deliver the coffins in good shape weve
got to watch out that we dont go blun-
dering in there while the men are car-
rying out the coffins

  thats right

  so deacon says that he told butcher
to come through and let us know as soon
as he has started away with the drivers
we can either be here or in the passage
then the three of us can slide away
from the undertaking joint one at a
time

  major nodded his approval deacon
was taking care of arrangements at the
other end this was all in accordance
with schedule deacon and major when
they worked together formed tentative
plans and made final decisions on the
spur of the moment

  weve some work to do before
butcher arrives announced major
spread out all these stacks that stay
the old vault looks a bit empty be-
cause weve been crowding it whats
gone is forgotten- were starting new
from now on

  ferret nodded the men began their
labors they stepped in and out of
the vault finally major walked back
a few paces and ferret stood leaning
against the outside of the vault

  a sweet job declared major
shake ferret were in the clear

  as the men clasped hands in silence
a low laugh came from a short distance
away both turned in alarm they
stood as though petrified then they
the shadow magazine



raised their hands slowly and mechan-
ically

  leaning upon the balustrate was a fig-
ure clad in black he seemed like a
projection of the darkness from the
stairway he was poised with elbows
resting on the rail and his hands-also
garbed in black-held two automatics
he had his enemies covered

  the identity of this unexpected foe
was no matter of doubt to major and
ferret they knew that the man was
the shadow they stared sullenly at
their captor and sought to pierce the
shadowy mask of blackness that lay be-
neath the brim of his slouch hat but
their effort was of no avail

  maurice exton and joel hawkins
came a mocking voice that whispered
its words otherwise known as major
and ferret

  the men glowered at the mention of
their secret names majors face was
defiant ferrets was venomous neither
made a move they were trapped

  one more is needed declared the
shadow tauntingly george ellsworth
-better known as butcher-will soon
be here then we shall have the trio
the cashier and his two tellers

  the vault requires new contents it
shall have them but three will be bet-
ter than two

  both major and ferret understood
these threatening automatics had them
helpless they would be forced into
the vault which they had rifled-and
butcher would be placed there with
them what would happen then 

  both pictured the result an alarm
perhaps police summoned to the bank
to find three men helplessly awaiting
their arrival they sensed the menace
of the shadow this man knew all
their game was ended

  ended unless they could count on
butcher if he should arrive in time
he might divert the shadow long
enough for them to attempt an escape
but hope faded with the thought

   the shadow  was slowly edging his
 arms along the rail reaching the top of
 the stairs from which he could ad-
 vance and be clear of any danger from
 below those menacing automatics did
  not vary from their targets a move
 by either major or ferret would mean
 death

   i f deacon would only come with
 butcher that might offer some help
 but deacon had planned otherwise he
 would travel away alone without know-
 ing the plight of his comrades butcher
 by himself could be of no use  he
 would blunder into this trap like a blind
 bull

   the shadow paused at the head of the
 stairs his course was simple now it
 meant that no chance remained for the
 two men whom he covered major
 groaned and ferret echoed with a snarl

  the shadow laughed-a jeering
 whispering laugh that sounded with
 chilling reverberations throughout the
 high-roofed room major shuddered
 and ferret cowered bold though these
 villains were they quailed at the trium-
 phant laugh of the shadow

   as the eerie echoes died away a shot
 rang out it reechoed in the big bank
 room-a loud report that came with
 startling suddenness with that shot
 the shadows form swayed dizzily it
 toppled sidewise and plunged headlong
 crashing down the stairs

   bewildered the men by the vault
 heard the muffled finish of the fall then
 came the clatter of an automatic as it
 fell from step to step

   silence followed and amid the still-
 ness a man came forward from a par-
 tition halfway down the room major
 and ferret dropped their arms and
 gasped in astonishment as they recog-
 nized the familiar face of judge

   their chief had saved them they
 had not even dreamed that he would be
 here yet he had been on hand to wit-
 ness their plight and to effect a rescue


the shadow magazine

  the gray-haired mans face was cajm
and barely smiling in his hand judge
held the revolver with which he had
fired his timely shot

  judge had finished the shadow

  now the leader motioned toward the
stairway with drawn guns the three
men made their way to the room below
on the floor lay a crumpled form with
black cloak spread about it the slouch
hat still clung to the shadows head
motionless the man of the night lay
face down on the floor

  major bent over the still form he
ripped aside the top of the black cloak
the action revealed a flow of blood
coming from a wound beside the shoul-
der

  major shook the slumped form half
raising it from the floor he let the
shadows form drop limp as he turned
to his companions with a smile

  looks like hes dead he announced
pretty close to it anyway

  savagely ferret aimed his gun at
the helpless body ready to drill it with
a tattoo of bullets his wrist was caught
by judges iron grasp

  stop warned judge what do
you want to do bring in the police
that one shot i fired was bad enough
its lucky old jimmy is stone-deaf pick
up his guns there on the steps

  ferret turned hurriedly to gather the
shadows two automatics

  frisk him major ordered judge

  major obeyed running his hands un-
der the black cloak he found no other
weapons judge turned to ferret on
the stairs

  get up and close that vault he
commanded tell me if you hear any-
thing turn out the light and listen by
the door

  major was starting to lift the shad-
ows head after ferret had scurried
away judge motioned him to stop
he wanted majors attention

  i figured this he said in a low even
tone i came in through the side door

with my pass-key you were at the
vault alone i waited by the partition

  i dont know how this man got in
but hes the chap we want take him
away make sure hes dead when you
get him in the passage give him a few
more bullets there if necessary

  major nodded

  then said judge coldly pick out
the nicest casket in deacons new stock
that can go out to-morrow-with this
in it

  he pointed to the black-clad figure
as he spoke judges eyes were gleam-
ing as he surveyed his victim

  the shadow he said with a low
insidious chuckle he stepped out of
his bailiwick major i know all about
the shadow superfighter-foe of the
underworld-the lone wolf who combats
crime

  with a calm gesture judge pock-
eted his revolver and hummed a few
bars of the funeral march major
smiled at the grim jest he also ad-
mired judges simple instructions for
disposing of the body the shadow
would travel in a mahogany casket
borne by deacons hearse

  ferret reappeared grinning and nod-
ding

  everything is jake judge he de-
clared that shot didnt start any-
thing

it finished some one though as-
serted major looking at the shadow

  major will tell you what to do fer-
ret said judge quietly i am leav-
ing i have an appointment i am go-
ing out by the same door i entered i
think that david traver president of
the middletown trust company has the
privilege of visiting his own bank

  major pointed to the body he took
the shoulders ferret the feet together
they lugged the shadow face down-
ward to the far corner of the room the
flowing cloak drooping to the floor
they shoved their burden through the
open panel then they were gone and
the shadow magazine



judge heard the muffled closing of the
stone barrier beyond

  judge smiled his well-aimed shot
had done its work it had clipped the
shadows shoulder at an angle in all
probability it had reached the mans
heart

  one against five no it had been
one against four-with one beside

  the leader had done his work let
the underlings perform the carrion task
of disposing of the body judge ex-
tinguished the light and went softly up
the stairs he reached the side door
and made his exit

  two minutes later david traver
president of the middletown trust was
standing at the corner there was an
annoyed look on his face

  it was five minutes after nine he
had an appointment to keep with har-
vey bronlon at the millionaires home
he would be late-quite late

  judge felt that tardiness was inex-
cusable even when circumstances had
made lateness unavoidable

  nevertheless his thin lips were smil-
ing when he hailed a passing cab and
ordered the driver to take him to har-
vey bronlons residence

  for judge had really had two ap-
pointments set for that evening he
was keeping the second now harvey
bronlon important though he was had
not been given precedence to-night

  for judges first appointment had
been with the shadow he had kept it
-as he had planned

chapter xviii

exit the shadow

  within the stone walls of the secret
passage major stood with ferret at
his side the rays of majors electric
torch were focused upon the body they
had carried to this place the inert
form of the shadow was sprawled
where they had dropped it

  ferret stepped forward into the light
his face was gleaming triumphantly
his revolver was in his hand he was
ready to do the deed that judge had
prevented-to fire bullets into that help-
less body whether they were necessary
or not

  wait a minute ferret growled
major if youre so quick with the
rod why didnt you pull it when this
fellow had us covered you might
have shot him while he was alive
maybe hes alive now suggested
ferret

  not likely disagreed major but
it doesnt make any difference if he is
he cant do anything

  a little more lead wont hurt him
no but it may hurt us look
here ferret these stone walls are
pretty thick but theres no positive
proof that theyre soundproof
theres nobody in the bank to hear
the shots

  im not thinking of the bank dont
forget that deacon is at the other end
loading coffins hes probably finished
by now if those drivers are down-
stairs with him we dont want them to
hear anything

  they couldnt hear a shot through
that wall

  why take a chance growled ma-
jor we can wait a few minutes cant
we butcher will be here then weu
know that everything is clear

  ferret was forced to yield to the logic
of major but the stoop-shouldered
chameleon was resentful he glowered
at the prostrate form in black

 he remembered-too vividly-how
that man had held him at bay he
wanted revenge-the satisfaction of
shooting his enemy whether alive or
dead

  but major chose to wait quietly as-
serting his authority he disclosed the
whole plan to ferret just as judge had
suggested it while ferret was upstairs
prowling through the bank


the shadow magazine

  when butcher gets here declared
major ill let you shoot a few bullets
into this fellow if hes alive then
well lug the body into the morgue and
put it in one of the caskets the rest
will be up to deacon

  all right returned ferret in a dis-
gruntled tone im going to watch him
close if i see any life in him im go-
ing to plug him

  he was staring shrewdly as he spoke
his eyes gleaming wickedly as he sur-
veyed the helpless enemy although
he didnot care to admit it to major
ferret was forced to agree that judges
bullet had done murderous work the
shadow had dropped like a winged bird
when judge had fired

  ferret made an impatient gesture
with his revolver his finger was
wavering on the trigger as he lifted the
gun toward the shadows form
angrily major seized his companions
wrist

  i told you to wait ferret he
growled wait do you get me
ferret leered at his superior

  kind of finicky arent you major
he snarled in a nasty insinuating tone
well youve started me wondering
how did that guy get in 

  into the bank questioned major
coldly

  yes replied ferret looking back
and forth from majorto the body on
the floor it couldnt be that he had
a friend somewhere around could it

 you mean- majors tone was

harsh

  i mean you exclaimed ferret
youre kind of protecting him arent
you right now sort of anxious to
make me hold back arent you well

here goes-

  majors hand caught ferrets wrist
the upturned light showed a steely glint
in majors eyes ferret tried to avoid
the glance he realized that he had
said too much

  you rat hissed major i get your
game now youre the one thats done
the double crossing now that the
shadow is dead you want to make it
look like you hate the sight of him
maybe you figure that if a few shots
were heard it would do some good try-
ing to queer the game eh 

  honest major-ferrets voice was
protesting-honest youve got me
wrong i-i shouldnt have said what i
did you-youre right major

  he was quailing before majors in-
dignant glare it had come to a show-
down and major was proving his su-
periority these abrupt accusations had
come as an outgrowth of the shadows
craftsmanship but in the crisis the
odds were unequal ferret was forced
to yield

  no more out of you growled ma-
jor

  all right major said ferret plead-
ingly im sorry major forget it
wont you

  major his flashlight in his left hand
drew his revolver with his right he
pointed his gun toward the body on the
floor and made a significant gesture

  im doing the shooting he declared
coldly if its necessary ill give this
bird all the bullets he needs youll
do what i tell you and youll like it
im waiting for butcher get me

  ferret nodded

  put away your gun ordered major

  ferret pocketed his revolver he
leaned against the wall and folded his
arms beneath his hunched shoulders

  he had lost all his braggadocio now
his chief concern was to avoid majors
glance major laughed as he saw the
furtive eyes move away he had shown
his authority all thought of mutiny
had been quelled

  major lowered his gun the scene
had the aspects of a tableau ferret
head turned away was backed against
the wall his arms still folded

  major was like a statue of vengeance

shad-a
the shadow magazine



his flashlight in his left hand-his gun
in his right-both were unmoving the
still body lay on the floor sprawled at
majors feet majors gun hand was
directly above it

  cold silence reigned major was
watching ferret who was gazing shift-
ily about then came motion unper-
ceived slowly with strange effort the
right hand of the shadow moved

  upward it came as though it alone
were imbued with life creeping like a
creature detached from the body beside
it the hand rose higher until its gloved
fingers were an inch away from majors
revolver

  the hand paused there as though
seeking strength for a mighty effort
then as major began to relieve the
tension by turning away from ferret
the black-clad hand acted

  the fingers caught the revolver as the
hand swung downward the sudden
motion caught major unprepared the
revolver was wrested from his grasp

  with a wild startled cry major
turned and his light revealed the ac-
tion on the floor the shadow was
rolling onto his back his hand clutch-
ing the gleaming revolver by the barrel
his body winced as the weight fell upon
the crippled left shoulder

  an amazing thrust for life but
one that could hardly avail

  the shadows face was upturned but
the slouch hat jammed over his eyes
still hid the features that lay beneath
the brim his left arm totally helpless
was bent underneath his sprawled form
his right held the revolver-but by the
wrong end

  major though weaponless held the
advantage and realized it the
shadow prone wounded could be no
match for him

the shadow had rolled a yard away
but the space was short and major
was reaching for the gun as he sprang
forward ah was in his favor-had he
shad-a

been coping with any one but the
shadow for despite his helplessness
and the fact that he could neither rise
nor use both hands the shadow was
equal to the emergency

  coincident with majors spring the
right hand of the shadow made a
quick twisting motion the gun flipped
backward in his hand the muzzle
swung up toward major and the
shadows hand caught the butt his out-
stretched finger was ready for the trig-
ger

  a clean bit of jugglery performed
in a split second as the gun plumped
safely in the shadows hand majors
fingers arrived they were closing upon
the barrel of the revolver when the
shadow pulled the trigger majors
form kept on hurtling forward on the
floor across the shadows body

  the flashlight slipped away from ma-
jors dying grasp it clattered on the
stone and lay shining along the cor-
ridor uselessly turned away from the
amazing scene of action

 the lunge of majors body had
trapped the shadows arm but that arm
was writhing free it was racing now
with ferret

  the moment that he had heard the
shot the stoop-shouldered man under-
stood his arms were folded and his
revolver was in his pocket but fer-
ret backing along the corridor was
quickly drawing his weapon he was
the first to fire

  then came a quick weird duel in the
dark the staccato barks of the revolvers
echoing like the roar of cannon fer-
ret was firing low toward the floor at
a form he could not see

  the shadow flattened had the partial
protection of majors dead body fer-
ret was crouching in the dark only the
flashes of his revolver betraying his lo-
cation

  quick alternate shots-with bullets
ricocheting everywhere ferret wild
and excited the shadow fighting with


the shadow magazine

      the shadow made a quick twisting motion the gun flipped
backward in his hand    his outstretched finger was ready for the
trigger   

waning strength from a position that
handicapped his aim

  the sharp roar ended with a mighty
burst as both revolvers barked at once
then only chattering echoes resounded
through the long corridor and ended
with a ghostly sound from the distant
wall-a tiny reflection of the two shots

 silence took command no one
stirred in that corridor of doom the
flashlight threw long streaks down the
floor and against the walls no one
spoke-not even a whisper broke the
stillness

  then came a low dragging sound
some one was creeping toward the flash-
the shadow magazine



light fingers closed about the handle
of the torch a form rising against the
wall cast a huge silhouette as it wavered
there outlined by reflected glare as the
flashlight pointed toward the floor

  the shadow had come to life

  judge and major had thought him
dead only ferret had doubted judges
shot had indeed done cruel work but
it had not killed

  the long toppling plunge head-first
down the stairs had stunned the
shadow only the protection of the
slouch hat had broken the final blow
when the head beneath it had struck the
floor at the bottom of the steps

  the shadow had regained his senses
on the floor of the corridor silent and
unmoving he had bided there until his
opportunity had come now in quick
conflict he had thwarted his enemies

  ferret had been right on one point
the thickness of the stone barriers was
sufficient to retain all noise within the
corridor

  this was lucky for the shadow if
butcher had entered in response to the
shots the shadow might not have been
able to cope with his third foe

  even now triumphant the shadow
was in a sorry plight he had been un-
scathed by ferrets bullets but the shot
that judge had fired had caused a seri--
ous wound

  weakened from loss of blood and
strained by superhuman effort the
shadow was experiencing a relapse he
sagged as he made his way along the
corridor his footsteps faltered he
sank to his knees

  the flashlight went out crawling
weakly through the darkness the
shadow strove to reach the end of the
corridor foot by foot he progressed
resting now and then before he re-
sumed his tedious way

  at last he gained his feet again and
paced forward at an unsteady gait the
effort spent his strength with a last
spasmodic exertion the shadow neared

the wall at the end of the corridor and
lost his footing

   he plunged to the floor and lay still
all was dark and silent throughout the
passage

  the shadow lay as motionless as the
two men who were dead he had
sought to make his exit from this vaulted
corridor of death but had failed

  was the shadow alive-or was he
dead

butcher enters

  deacon standing by the open door
that led to the alleyway was superin-
tending the loading of coffins upon one
of harvey bronlons trucks

  four men were at work they had
brought the caskets from below and
had stacked them in the alley now
their task was nearly completed only
two of the long boxes remained

  put them in the hearse ordered
deacon i didnt think the truck
would hold them all the men obeyed

  while the workers were thus engaged
deacon drew away from the front door
and stepped into the funeral parlor

  butcher he whispered

  the big man advanced through the
gloomy room

  im riding up to bronlons de-
clared deacon in a low voice follow-
ing right after the truck with the hearse
as soon as were away go through and
tip off major and ferret

  sure replied butcher the only
thing deacon is the idea of you going
alone on this ride suppose-

  dont be a fool butcher this trip
is nothing it has to look on the level
wouldnt it look fine-deacons tone
became sarcastic-for you to be tak-
ing a ride in an undertakers hearse

  you know that nothing can go
wrong these men dont know what
theyre carrying those coffin lids are
clamped down so tight it will take a
crowbar to open them dont you


the shadow magazine

worry judge will have them within
half an hour your job is to slide along
with the others be sure the door stays
locked im locking it now

  o k ill be seeing you soon

  you will not i dont know you
stick to your tellers window and ill
keep doing business in the funeral par-
lor

  with that deacon was gone butcher
heard the door close behind him listen-
ing the big man caught the sound of
the truck driving away then the hearse
followed butcher started for the stairs

  he paused a moment in the gloomy
morgue butcher grinned as he stared
at the depleted piles of old coffins a
clever idea to-nights shipment these
were brainy men-judge deacon and
major

  butcher felt that he and ferret were
fortunate to be linked up with this crew
unlike ferret he had never fancied act-
ing on his own initiative butcher was
content to follow and do as he was
told

  realizing that major and ferret
would be waiting butcher hurriedly
opened the panel and shoved back the
sliding stone barrier behind it his
flashlight was in his hand his re-
volver was in his pocket

  the flashlight was needed for the
corridor was dark but before butcher
pressed the button he paused and
sniffed in the darkness his nostrils
caught the pungent odor of powder

  as he stepped forward in the gloom
butchers foot stumbled against a form
he quickly pressed the flashlight and
its rays shone upon a black-clad figure
sprawled upon the floor of the corridor

  the discovery astonished butcher it
was entirely unexpected and he could
make nothing of it the thought oc-
curred that it must be either major or
ferret

  he bent over the prostrate form and
decided that it was a corpse should

he go on-or should he stop here
butcher decided that the latter course 
was preferable he gripped the body
and dragged it back through the panel
until he reached the floor of the morgue

  there butcher let his burden rest
gently on the floor he carefully rolled
the body over on its back he pulled
away the slouch hat

  this was neither major nor ferret
here was a stern calm face-a face
that bespoke death butcher turned the
flashlight upon it he noticed that the
face was masklike a disguise that might
have been applied by some artificial
touch it was white and waxen

  butcher was sure that his find was
dead he ran his light close to the eye-
lids

  he could not understand how this
stranger had reached the secret corridor
he wished that deacon was here to tell
him what to do well major would
tell he must hurry and find major

  butcher entered the corridor but he
hesitated to advance even though he
was sure that the body now in the
morgue was dead it would not be wise
to leave if it could be avoided butcher
hallooed softly along the silent corri-
dor his call came back-a whispered
echo

  butchers light was turned toward the
other end of the passage off in the
dimness the big man fancied that he
saw some one lying there he walked
forward directly over the spot where
the black-clad form had lain

  he stepped within an inch of a re-
volver that lay on the floor butcher
had not observed it before for it had
been beneath the body that he had
found nor did lie see it now with his
attention diverted toward the other end
of the corridor

  revolver drawn butcher advanced
he neared the end of the corridor he
came upon the forms of two men one
lying on his side the other  his back

  an incredulous gasp came from
the shadow magazine



butchers lips major and ferret-
dead

  batcher was totally bewildered he
stooped down and examined both bodies
they had been killed so had the other
man no one else was in the corridor
save butcher himself

  a triple gun fight in which all had
been slain that was the explanation
that came to butchers brain slowly
he gained his wits and realized that it
would be wise to return and examine
the third body

  back in the morgue that waxen face
was still turned toward the ceiling as
butcher had left it now the eyelids
slowly opened the eyes of the
shadow stared straight upward the
head began to turn

  his senses aroused by the dragging of
his body and the bright light that
butcher had flashed before his eyelids
the shadow had returned to semicon-
sciousness but until this moment he
had remained in a daze

  now he recognized his surroundings
he shifted his body to the left and
paused expressionless as his body
turned upon his useless left arm and
shoulder

  with an effort the shadow shifted
to the right he managed to prop him-
self upon his right arm then gained
his knees he stared at the half-opened
panel

  some one had entered the corridor
and had brought him here that enemy
was in the corridor now weakened
and weaponless the shadow could
make no retreat

  crawling lamely he made his way
to the panel so that he could close it
there he hesitated listening then
peered through the opening

  far away he caught the glimmer of
the light and knew that whoever was
in the passage was at the other end the
light from the morgue threw a long dim
ray into the nearer end of the corridor

and on the edge of that slight shaft of
illumination something sparkled-bare-
ly visible but enough to attract the at-
tention of the shadows keen eyes

  a revolver the one that he had
wrested from major to drop later
when he had fallen unconscious the
sight of the weapon brought a sparkle
to the shadows eyes

  this grim personage ended danger
by encountering it weak though he
was he planned that course now he
dragged himself through the panel and
lay flat in the corridor

  butcher was coming back the mans
heavy footfalls were echoing along tlie
passage his light was shining in this
direction it was yards away but com-
ing closer

  with renewed effort the shadow
dragged himself forward grimly head-
ing for that revolver which lay so near
and yet so far

  butchers light revealed him an oath
resounded in the passage the heavy
footsteps quickened and a shot rang
out butcher was hurrying toward the
shadow firing as he came the range
was great the shot went wide

  butcher paused to fire again this
time he barely missed the bullet struck
the floor beside the shadows body and
ricocheted against the uplifted panel

  the shadow never faltered crawl-
ing onward he dropped prone as
butcher once more on the run fired
a third shot

  it was high by inches only the
shadows drop had saved his life the
bullet whistled over his head

  but it was not through fear of butch-
er s bullets that the shadow had lunged
himself flat and forward this was his
last great effort to reach the revolver it
was successful the shadows out-
stretched right hand gripped the handle
of the gun

  butcher saw the hand as it fumbled
with the weapon he rushed forward
from fifty feet away his flashlight

gleaming like the mammoth headlight	closer range sure range from which

of a locomotive his revolver swinging	to end the life of his foe fury fought

into position for a sure shot at close	with agony as butcher neared the

range	shadow

 the shadows hand came suddenly	butcher raised his gun to fire he

upward its strength recovered to an	steadied himself upon his knees with

amazing extent the black finger	his light in his left hand the finger of

pressed the trigger

  a roar resounded the shot was
aimed directly at the blazing light
butcher hurtled forward and landed
in the corridor his torch flying far
ahead of him

   the shadows finger pressed the trig-
ger again the hammer clicked only
one shot had remained from that fight
with major and ferret the last bullet
was gone

  moreover the shadows strength
was spent his hand dropped to
the floor butcher was roaring like
a wounded bull he fired thrice in the
dark there was no response butcher
was on his hands and knees leaning
against the wall forgetting the agony
of a wound in his side with his mad
desire to slay this enemy who had
clipped him

  then the big man stopped he had
one cartridge left in his six-shooter
he would use it well

  staggering along against the wall
butcher approached his helpless foe
he came to the flashlight he stooped
to pick it up and stumbled he
sprawled on the floor and rolled in
agony determined he regained his
knees although he could not rise

  butchers lips were flecked with
blood he was sputtering coughing as
he turned his light full upon the pros-
trate form in black some twenty feet
away its outstretched hand moving
feebly

   the shadow was striving to rise he
had dropped the revolver upon the floor

  butcher crawled forward he was
leaving nothing to chance this wound
was getting him he knew he wanted

his right upon the trigger ready to
fire that certain shot

  the two men were not ten feet apart
the shadow was raising himself pain-
fully butcher was swaying unsteadily
he gave a hideous coughing gulp his
throat was choked with a sudden rush
of blood with a last gasp butcher
crumpled sidewise and fell dead

  the shadows last shot had done its
work mortally wounded butcher had
not known the seriousness of his hurt
he had striven onward sustained by a
mad desire for revenge now he was
dead like major and ferret he had
not lived to fire his one remaining bullet

  the flashlight lying on the floor
sent a long distorted beam toward the
panel at the end of the passage that
light showed the shadow supporting
himself against the wall with his good
right hand

  fighting his way the shadow gained
the panel and crawled into the gloomy
morgue he lifted himself by the pile
of coffins with strange unsteady gait
the man in black tottered wearily for the
stairs his mighty spirit carrying him
onward

  twice disarmed and left for dead
the shadow superantagonist of crime
had slain those who had sought his
life

deacon gets an order

  four men were seated in a com-
fortable smoking room puffing their
cigars harvey bronlon was entertain-
ing david traver president of the
middletown trust company together
with the mayor of the city and a state
official
the shadow magazine

n

  the financial affairs of middletown
had been the subject of discussion
judge in his most convincing tones had
told of the great work performed by
his bank the others had listened in
approval

  middletown was relying upon its
trust company the mayor said the
state official emphasized the need of
salvaging the wreck of the county na-
tional bank so far as the surrounding
communities were concerned

  suppose said judge quietly that
we begin immediately by opening branch
offices for the present they need only
serve our own depositors who are lo-
cated outside of middletown proper i
am willing to do this work

   excellent said the state official

  you may announce it then said
judge on monday i intend to sup-
plement our present organization with
new employees i prefer however to
avoid hiring any who were workers for 
the county national while hubert
salisbury is undoubtedly the man re-
sponsible for thefts in that institution
nevertheless it would be best to create
an entirely new staff of workers rather
than take on any who were associated
with the defunct bank

  i agree with you mr traver said
bronlon

  how will you arrange it  asked the
mayor

  my cashier and my two tellers are
capable trustworthy men replied
judge i shall relieve them of their
present duties and send them to sur-
vey the field i intend to roll up my
sleeves gentlemen and handle the cash-
iers work myself i have selected cer-
tain men among the clerical staff whom
i can insert as capable tellers

  whatever you suggest mr traver
said the state official we rely en-
tirely upon your judgment you speak
of rolling up your sleeves you have
done that already your servicein this
crisis has been marvelous the assets

of the trust company-seemingly in-
exhaustible-have sustained confidence
the whole district owes you a debt of

gratitude-

  the speaker stopped as a servant en-
tered the man looked toward bron-
lon who asked what was wanted

  its mr best sir announced the
flunky he came with the truck and
everything has been unloaded as you in-
structed he asked if you wanted to

see him-

  best eh bronlon laughed tell
him to come in

  he turned to the others in explana-
tion

  best is the undertaker he said
very enterprising chap he bought a
new stock of caskets and put the old
ones up for sale at cost i bought a
supply of them we have a little fu-
neral parlor of our own over at the
settlement where the factory workers
live i intend to turn the caskets over
to the man in charge just one of the
many provisions that i constantly make
funerals are regrettable but we have
them just the same

  deacon solemn-faced appeared at
the door and quietly bowed to harvey
bronlon with an obsequious air

come in mr best said bronlon
without rising he introduced dea-
con to the guests the undertaker
shook hands when he came to judge
he was most courteous in his greeting

  ah mr traver he said i shook
hands with you at the banquet the other
night im pleased to meet you again
sir pleased indeed you have done
much for middletown

  judge made a sign as he smiled in-
dulgently deacon caught it he knew
that it meant for him to remain waiting
outside

  when deacon had gone there was a
short silence then judge remembered
that he had neglected to make a tele-
phone call he excused himself and de-
parted


the shadow magazine

  did you notice that fellow best
questioned the mayor the look on
his face when he shook hands with mr
traver you wouldnt expect an un-
dertaker to have a lot of sentiment but
hes caught the spirit of admiration for
david traver like the rest of us a
wonderful man gentlemen a wonderful
man a great boon to middletown

  outside on the porch deacon was
waiting the truck had pulled away
the hearse was at the foot of the drive
judge stepped into the darkness and
pressed deacons arm

  did you see major or ferret he
questioned in a low voice before you
came away 

  no replied deacon softly i left
butcher there

  thats all right said judge they
ran into trouble to-night they were
trapped by the shadow

  in spite of himself deacon could not
repress a low startled exclamation

  i was there continued judge his
voice scarcely audible i finished the
hound with one shot luckily nothing
was heard major and ferret dragged
him away-into the passage

  they didnt come to me-

  because i told them to wait for
butcher

  ah that explains it

  what instructions did you give
butcher 

  i told him to leave with major and
ferret

  good major will see that all is
right he will put the body in one of
the caskets its up to- you to get it
out

  monday responded deacon ill
take a look to-morrow judge i dont
want to go in there again to-night
leave it to me- ill have a scheme
figured out for monday morning
youll hear from me to-morrow
night said judge im going for a
trip with bronlon in the morning either

you or i will hear from major any-
way

  ill take a look around outside when
weve put the hearse in the garage de-
clared deacon but it would be bad
for me to go in there now especially
as theres nothing i can do to-night

  go past the bank too suggested
judge see that everything is quiet
call me if you notice anything that ap-
pears suspicious

  he thumped deacon on the back and
stepped quietly back into the house
when judge reached the smoking room
bronlon and the guests were awaiting
his return

  where were we asked the mayor
anxious to resume the trend of the in-
terrupted conversation-
talking about coffins said judge
with a smile

  harvey bronlon laughed

   before you go mr traver he said
i want to show you that storage room
under my garage where they put those
coffins you would admire it its
like the strong room of a bank

   i should like to see it said judge
the conversation went back to bank-
ing judge showed interest but his
thoughts were elsewhere he knew that
deacon could phone him here without
risk and would not hesitate to do so

  as the minutes went by judge gained
a satisfied feeling with his four sub-
ordinates on the job no news was the
best that he could have there was
no ring from the telephone in the out-
side hallway convinced that he had
slain the shadow judge was content
with the fact that the remainder of the
work was of minor consequence

  he knew that he could rely on major
thus the disposal of the shadows body
had been nothing more than routine
the only possible danger-and that was
remote-was the bare chance that the
shot which judge had fired in the bank
might have caused a delayed alarm

  but that chance was fading now dea-
the shadow magazine



con was in the vicinity by this time and
he was the ideal man to check upon the
situation major ferret and butcher
had been told to take to cover for the
rest of the night but deacon could
saunter the streets of middletown as he
pleased

  thus the absence of a report was re-
assuring judge forgot his slight wor-
ries and devoted all his thoughts to the
subject now under discussion

  in his minds eye judge had pictured
deacon methodical and unobtrusive
strolling about the block where the bank
building was located in this mental
image judge was quite correct

  deacon was coming back from the
downtown garage where he had left the
hearse driver he passed the comer
where the county national bank
loomed dreary and forlorn he stopped
to light a cigar outside the middletown
trust company

  his shrewd eye looked through the
darkness toward the side entrance his
searching gaze was raised toward the
upper windows of the banking room

  all quiet not a glimmer of light

  deacon strolled on he came to the
front of his own establishment and ob-
served that ail was well with no one
in view he sauntered to the side door
through which he had instructed the
others to leave the door was locked

  deacon had thought of communicat-
ing with major but this proof was suf-
ficient to satisfy him one rule of the
five chameleons was to avoid unneces-
sary communication to-night of all
nights that rule was wise

  back in the street deacon cast an-
other glance toward the silent building
then he walked away heading along the
street toward the apartment house
where fie had a three-room suite

  he pictured the events of this eve-
ning major had told him of the un-
known menace called the shadow to-
gether they had wondered while they

had puzzled judge had prepared he
had been there to meet the shadow-
to end the menace with a single well-
timed shot

  the shadow was dead the big job
was complete the labors of the five
chameleons had reached the desired
climax deacons close inspection had
proved that all was well the solemn-
faced man was congratulating him-
self

  but deacon had studied buildings
only his keen eyes had ignored the
ground beneath his feet

  back on the sidewalk in front of the
undertaking establishment lay a trail
of evidence that he had overlooked

  a splotch of blood-another farther
on-a third glaring beneath the light
of a street lamp across from the un-
dertaking parlor a fourth-a fifth-
a sixth-then the trail ended

  these marks traced the first stages of
the path which the shadow had fol-
lowed

     chapter xxi y
the symbol of the shadow

  martiia delmar was alone again to-
night she had grown accustomed to
loneliness since her life had been
racked by grief she had instinctively
shunned companionship

  only once had she unburdened her
troubled thoughts last night she had
spoken to the shadow and had gained
new hope from his strength

  the shadow had gone but his de-
parture had left martha delmar confi-
dent that her new friend would succeed
in unraveling the mystery that sur-
rounded the death of her father and the
arrest of hubert salisbury

  the shadow had said that he would
return martha wondered if he would
visit her to-night

  it was notyet midnight and some-
how martha connected that mystic hour
with the spectral figure of the shadow
she was determined to wait until long


the shadow magazine

after twelve in hope that he would
come

  marthas intuition told her that deep
plotting had occurred here in middle-
town dangerous schemers were at
work pitted against them was a lone
man the shadow

  although martha had no definite idea
of who her enemies might be she re-
alized that their resources must be tre-
mendous so far they had succeeded
in their schemes

  she knew that secrecy alone could un-
dermine these treacherous dangerous
plotters thus the shadow could hope
for no help from any one in middle-
town except herself once he re-
vealed his hidden hand the odds would
be with the foe

  who were the enemies only the
shadow knew all persons in middle-
town seemed hostile to martha but she
knew that her many former friends were
guided simply by popular opinion

  try as she might she could not point
to the ones who might be responsible
she had foolishly resorted to a vague
condemnation of unknown enemies it
had brought her ridicule

  but it had brought the shadow also
since that strange meeting with the ap-
parition in black martha had retained
her confidence and through her mind
burned every detail of that eventful in-
terview that had been both fantastic and
real

  strange thought the girl how the
shadow had arrived and left last night
opening and closing the heavy front
door in spite of the strong locks which
barred it the very thought of the
mysterious visit was awe-inspiring
martha glanced toward the door of the
room half expecting to see the shadow
standing there

  as the girl stared into the gloomy
hall her nerves were tense and her ears
were as alert as her eyes she fancied
that she heard a slight sound from the

floor below she listened closely and
finally decided that it had been her
imagination

  then came another noise that con-
vinced her that the first surmise had
been correct it was the sound of
something dropping dully to the floor
it seemed to come from the stairs

  boldly martha arose and walked into
the upstairs hall her heart was beat-
ing fast as she neared the stairs she
looked down along the steps and stood
petrified by momentary fright

  a crumpled figure was lying on the
stairs a few steps up from the ground
floor the face was turned downward
the right arm was extended as though
its white hand had tried to clutch the
banister to avert a fall

  for a moment the girl was worried
then she realized that this body was
helpless it lay as motionless as death
it wore no cloak or hat the dark suit
made it appear a huddled mass the
gray-streaked hair formed the only con-
trast to his somber appearance

  martha descended the stairs she
gazed with pity upon the intruder
when she reached his side she saw that
he was unconscious she placed her
hands upon his body and immediately
noticed the wound in his left shoulder
the mans dark coat was blood-
soaked

  the girl moved the body slightly
the left arm slipped free and dangled
loosely upon the stairs martha heard
a slight click as the limp hand dropped
to the step

  she touched the hand and her eyes
opened wide slowly thoughtfully she
raised the hand into the light

  upon one finger was the gleaming
gem which had burned its way into her
memory even in this gloomy light
the vivid hues of the glrasol glimmered
with fantastic changing colors the
symbol of the shadow

  this was the shadow

  he had been wounded and he was
the shadow magazine



close to death he had come to her
for aid what could she do

  a sudden thought came to the girl
she realized that the shadows inten-
tion had been to reach her room to
show her the jewel that she remem-
bered and tell her how she could help
him he had come not as a mysterious
form but in the character of a man
with gray hair

  the shadow was playing a part and
it was probable that he had some sign
of identification the girl reached into
the pockets of the mans coat there
she discovered a small cardcase she
withdrew it and found that it contained
a stack of engraved cards the upper-
most card bore the name

            hfxry arnaud 

  the girls mind worked swiftly the
housemaid was in the house on the
third floor she could be called later
the chauffeur was no longer here this
week had ended his term of service
to-day had been his last martha knew
that she could depend upon the maid-
servant but medical attention was
needed

  she thought of doctor joseph mer-
ritt the old family physician he had
been away from middletown at the time
of her fathers death

  he was one of the few people who
had called up to offer her condolences
that had been after his return to mid-
dletown when martha was going
through the first bitter stages of social
ostracism

  she had thanked doctor merritt for
his kindness in phoning but her pride
and bitterness had restrained her from
inviting the old family friend to call
now howevershe felt that she might
count on him in this terrible emergency

  she left the stairs and hurried to the
telephone she called doctor merritts
home the physician answered martha
asked him if he could come over right
away

  the troubled tone of the girls voice
must have been noticed by the doctor
he asked for no explanations he said
that he would be there

  martha called the maid the woman
had retired martha told her to get
dressed and to come downstairs then
the girl went to the front door it was
closed but not locked she realized
that the shadow had opened it but had
been too weak to attempt to lock it be-
hind him

  a motor purred outside footsteps
crunched on the gravel walk martha
opened the door and admitted doctor
merritt the physician looked at the
girl in a puzzled manner martha
gripped his arm and drew him into the
hall

  she led him to the stairs and doctor
merritt stopped short as he saw the
body there

 who-who- he began

  he is an old friend of daddys
said martha in a low voice mr ar-
naud he is wounded ill tell you
all-all about him doctor but please
-first-look after him

  the physician nodded as he placed
his bag upon the floor and leaned over
the unconscious man then he beckoned
to martha

  come he said we must take him
to a bed upstairs

  the doctor was a man of unusual
strength for his age he was at least
sixty but his features and his physique
were youthful he took the great share
of the burden while martha helped
with surprising strength

  the form of henry arnaud finally
rested upon its right side on a bed in a
spare room there martha was able
to see arnauds face

  it was a firm well-molded coun-
tenance it was pale but unyielding
martha stared at the closed eyelids
hoping frantically that the shadow still
lived


the shadow magazine

  the maid was here now she and
martha were following the physicians
instructions doctor merritt was a prac-
titioner of long experience he tended
the wound with the utmost skill
martha watching the shadows face
saw the eyes open and sparkle mo-
mentarily then the eyelids closed

  it was after midnight when the physi-
cian and the girl stood together in the
downstairs hall doctor merritt was
quiet and thoughtful martha delmar
was tense

  he is all right said the doctor
the wound is by no means a serious
one he has suffered chiefly from loss
of blood he must remain quiet for a
few days while he regains his strength
he is too weak to talk at present so
you can tell me how it happened

  i dont know doctor merritt de-
clared martha frankly i only know
that mr arnaud is a friend-a true
friend-and that he came here
wounded

  i must report this case said the
physician

  please doctor pleaded martha
you must not make me the victim of
more notoriety i have suffered terribly
since my father died people have
plotted against me doctor merritt and
mr arnaud is the only one who has
stood by faithfully so much is at

stake doctor-

  the girls pathetic tone succeeded
doctor merritt nodded slowly

  i shall wait a few days he said
you may rely upon me miss delmar
since you know nothing of the accident
i shall wait until i can question mr
arnaud

  i think it would be best for me to
stay away a little while-unless i hear
from you i see no possible complica-
tions call me if any should develop
but say nothing

  no one will know declared martha
i can rely on my servant thank you
doctor this may mean worlds to me

  upstairs the girl entered the room
where henry arnaud lay weak and
quiet his eyes opened as he heard
marthas approach the maid had
gone to prepare some medicine

  henry amauds lips moved they
whispered words martha listened in-
tently and nodded as she caught their
meaning she found a paper and pen-
cil and wrote a message that the
shadow dictated

 afterward when henry arnaud
seemed to be comfortably sleeping
martha took the paper downstairs
there at the telephone she sent a tele-
gram to rutledge mann an investment
broker in new york

  it did not seem to be an important
message it called for an immediate
delivery of all the bonds which mr
mann had been instructed to purchase
they were to be sent by air mail with
special delivery when they reached mid-
dletown the telegram included this
address and martha gave her own name
as the signature

  she wondered about the message it
seemed like the garbled idea of a con-
fused mind what could its purpose
be martha wondered but she had
obeyed

  for henry arnaud wore the symbol
of the shadow and his dictates were
the only hope that remained to martha
delmar

chapter xxii

sunday night

  harvey bronlons big limousine
swung into the dark driveway its bril-
liant headlights throwing a tremendous
glare upon the porch of the millionaires
home bronlon himself stepped from
the car he was followed by judge

  the two men entered the house they
were met by a servant who spoke to
harvey bronlon

  some one has been trying to call
mr traver sir said the flunky he
left a number here
the shadow magazine



  bronlon passed the slip of paper to
judge who scanned it closely he went
to the telephone and called he spoke
in quiet terse monosyllables then he
hung up the receiver and went into
bronlons smoking room where the mil-
lionaire was awaiting him

  its deacon declared judge in a
low whisper something has hap-
pened i told him to get up here right
away he couldnt talk over the tele-
phone

  bronlon nodded he rang a bell and
servant appeared

  did mr best call me to-day he
asked

  no sir

  i told him to come back declared
bronlon perhaps he will call this
evening if he arrives show him in
here

  the two men sat staring at each other
in silence bronlon was glowering
judge was serious they talked tensely
in a low undertone at last judge
shrugged his shoulders

  no use worrying until deacon gets
here he said

  bronlon uttered a grunt of agree-
ment

  fifteen minutes later mr best was
announced deacon was ushered in
he stood solemnly until the servant had
gone then when bronlon closed the
door he slipped into a chair his usually
quiet face betraying excitement

  were up against it judge he said
everything went wrong last night
that fellow you thought you killed
must have come to life he got away-
and were three men short

 you mean-

  i mean that our pals are dead ma-
jor ferret and butcher all stretched
out in the corridor

  amazement appeared upon judges
face it turned to fury he rose in
his chair and clenched his fists he
looked at bronlon the millionaire

wore the expression of a hunted man
judge became suddenly calm

  give me the details he said to
deacon

  i went by there last night declared
deacon everything was quiet to-
day i waited until after noon i hadnt
heard a word from major

  i thought he might have called you
up-but i knew that you were out of
town i decided i had better take a
look in the morgue-to see the body
that was supposed to be in the coffin

  i went down the coffins were all
empty i saw a little pool of blood on
the floor drops running to the panel
in the wall drops going toward the
stairway

  i went into the corridor there i
found them butcher-i stumbled over
him the first thing major and ferret
were at the other end of the corri-
dor

  what did you do asked judge
quietly

  i left them there said deacon
thats the best place for the present
no one will ever find them we can get
rid of the bodies later but how are
you going to cover things up to-morrow
-when they arent at the bank

  judge pondered for a moment then
smiled grimly

  remember what i said here last
night he questioned about sending
my three chief men out on survey work
well thats gone into effect the an-
nouncement went to the newspapers
that gives us a breathing spell so far
as the first problem is concerned

  but what about the cash-

  bronlons question was an anxious
gasp

  out to-night said judge firmly
deacon is here he has come to ex-
amine the caskets and to see about
purchasing some additional ones you
and he go over to the storage room i
happen to go along

  shall we ship them out again


the shadow magazine

  no it will be a transfer it wont
take us long will it deacon

  not a great while replied deacon
the money goes into those packing
cases said judge quietly weve held
them there for emergency the truck
can take the cases away early in the
morning after that-well that has
all been planned

  ah right said bronlon his tone
easing

  theres just one danger declared
judge coldly the shadow is still
alive he is wise to our game we
must get him he cant be far away
i think i know where he is said
deacon quietly

you do exclaimed judge eagerly
yes replied deacon i had a
hunch you remember that the girl-
delmars daughter-gave an interview
in which she mentioned the shadow
yes

  i remembered that it made me
figure that if he was working with any
one here in town it would he martha
delmar so i drove past there to-day
i looked where i didnt look last night
-at the sidewalks

 you saw-

  a splotch of blood on the sidewalk
by the corner like a man had stopped
there leaning against the telegraph
pole that settled it in my mind the
shadow is at delmars 

  if you could have planned some

way to get him-

  it would have been useless judge
whatever he might tell he has told al-
ready to-night is the time to get in
there but you cant do it-and i cant
do it

  youre right deacon it is a ticklish
situation if the shadow is there
well have to get him and the girl too
we cant kill the shadow and leave the
girl-

  he paused puzzled deacon could
offer no suggestion it was bronlon
who furnished the inspiration

  ive got it he exclaimed bringing
his huge fist down on the table beside
him ive got it vigilantes

  judge looked at bronlon question-
ingly

  you know this region judge scid
the millionaire theyve done some
mob lynchings in the past now look
at the situation popular indignation is
all against hubert salisbury theres
been rumors that people have planned
to storm the jail and lynch him for kill-
ing wellington that talk died away

  but every one is angry at the del-
mar girl because shes stood by salis-
bury theres been talk about running
her out of town now suppose it was
known that she is shielding a man there
in the house whats the answer  who
could he be

  some accomplice of salisburys de-
clared judge- thats what the town
would think

  right exclaimed bronlon if the
tip got out it wouldnt take much to
start a surging mob down there-espe-
cially on a sunday night theyd get
the man theyd carry away the girl
maybe they would kill her too
youve got it bronlon said judge
but we cant run the risk a mob is
too uncertain-too unruly it might
ruin us

  not the mob im planning leered
bronlon

 understanding dawned upon the
faces of judge and deacon they
listened with changing expressions
while bronlon unfolded his scheme

  my man critz he said you
know him-the one in charge of bring-
ing the bonus and the pay roll he has
thirty under him judge but we dont
want that many six will be enough
critz has his own pets-men who will
do anything i tell them

  ill start them down to-night
masked vigilantes drop in on del-
mars place and get that fellow drag
the shadow magazine



him out front and shoot him carry
away the girl the town will go mad

all for the unknown vigilantes-

  youve struck it right declared
judge approvingly no one will ever
know handle it carefully bronlon
the millionaire arose and lumbered
heavily from the room he came back
with a grin on his face

  i called critz on the telephone he
said told him to get up here right
away-and to say nothing about it hell
be here in ten minutes

  you listen in the other room wait
and hear me handle this hi tell critz
to get his men and tell them that this
job is his own idea he can say that
the men downtown have been talking
about it-that the middletown people
are yellow and dont have the nerve

  it will never get back to me judge
i wont know a thing about it even if
critzs name is mentioned im telling
critz that at the start he will under-
stand but hell have a nice sum wait-
ing for him if he puts this over
exactly smiled judge

  deacons morose face gleamed
bronlons two companions arose and
went into a side room where they could
listen without being seen jake critz
bronlons chief man at arms would be
here within ten minutes the time
passed quickly

  judge and deacon heard the conver-
sation between bronlon and his hench-
men critz was a tough-faced fellow
who bore the scars of battles with
strikers in the hectic days of the past
he listened to his employers instruc-
tions and growled his willing assent

  then he was gone off to form the
squad of pretended vigilantes silently
judge and deacon shook hands with
bronlon

  well start over to the storage room
soon suggested the millionaire we
can do our work here while critz is
doing his at delmars

  the three shrewd men were jubilant

they had called the shadows turn
he had managed to escape before but
this time he would have no chance
seven hardened ruffians were on their
way to attack a wounded man and a
helpless girl the man would be slain
the girl abducted

  this time it meant death to xhe
shadow

chapter xxiii

the vigilante squad

  martha delmar was looking for an
umbrella in the closet under the front
stairway tt had begun to rain out-
side and she was about toleave the
house for a drug store a few blocks
away

  the girl found the umbrella and
with it she uncovered two other objects
one was a crumpled garment the other
was a slouch hat martha lifted the
cloth and it spread out she was hold-
ing a black cloak with crimson lining

  carefully the girl folded the gar-
ment and placed it and the hat in the
corner where she had discovered them
she realized that the shadow when he
had come here the night before had first
dropped his hat and cloak before reveal-
ing himself in the guise of henry ar-
naud

  the girls hand touched something
on the floor where the cloak had lain
it proved to be a gun she left the
weapon untouched

  in the hallway martha paused she
heard a sound from above looking up
she saw henry arnaud fully clad
standing at the top of the stairway his
tall form was erect but his right hand
rested heavily upon the banister

  his face was pale and drawn but his
eyes reflected a vivid sparkle the
girl looked toward his left arm it
rested loosely at his side and from the
fingers martha caught the glow of the
fire opal-a vivid spark that simulated
the flashing eyes

you must go back exclaimed


the shadow magazine

martha in a worried voice you are
not well you must rest-

  henry arnaud smiled as he slowly
descended the steps holding firmly to
the rail

  have you forgotten the answer to
my telegram he inquired quietly it
is nine oclock now

  the girl remembered a wire had
come from new york that morning it
had stated that the bonds were being
shipped that they would be delivered at
nine oclock

  it had carried two code letters-m
and v-evidently referring to the se-
curities that had been ordered

  henry arnaud had reached the bot-
tom of the steps

  we are facing danger he said
the danger is grave it may strike
soon i am now able to face it but i
must move alone so i have provided
for your protection you are going
away to safety until the menace is
ended

  martha made no reply she did not
understand

  by airplane from new york mur-
mured henry arnaud half aloud
then by automobile here by nine
oclock it is nine now

  arnaud stopped he was staring at
the door martha saw the steely glint
in his eyes-the sparkle that she had
seen in the eyes of the shadow she
stared in the direction of his gaze-
toward the front door

  the door had opened and three
masked- men were advancing they
were uncouth roughly dressed fellows
each carried a gleaming revolver and
their weapons were covering henry ar-
naud and martha delmar

  the girl gasped she knew the stories
of past activities in middletown these
men were vigilantes organized to deal
mob violence somehow they had
learned that henry amaud was in this
house they had identified him with

the cause of hubert salisbury whom all
middletown now cursed

  bravely the girl placed herself in
front of henry arnaud this man was
wounded he was a guest in her home
defiantly she faced the invaders

  the leader of the vigilantes laughed
he thrust the girl aside henry ar-
naud offered no resistance a look of
puzzlement appeared upon his face he
quietly awaited the bidding of these
captors

  we want you said the leader
gruffly come along quietly you and
the girl both nothings going to hap-
pen to you if you behave yourself

  henry arnaud walked calmly for-
ward the leader striding beside him
his revolver pressed close to his cap-
tive martha delmar was protesting
the other two men were dragging her
in spite of her struggles

  a hand was thrust in front of the
girls mouth to prevent an outcry for
martha was trying to scream the truth
she knew the ways of vigilantes

  outside the door other men would be
waiting they would assassinate henry
arnaud the moment that he stepped
through the door the man would be
between two fires

  the leader of the trio had henry ar-
naud at his mercy the other men were
holding their guns but the girl was
taxing all their efforts

  arnaud had he resisted would have
been shot on the instant martha how-
ever was a different matter she was
not to die the brutal killing of a girl
would turn public sympathy against
these vigilantes

  arnaud and his captor were nearing
the half-opened door the chief of the
vigilantes urged the wounded man to
one side he wanted martha to be
dragged out first he shot a quick
wary glance to see that they were com-
ing

  that was the movement which ar-
naud had been peacefully awaiting in
shad-a
the shadow magazine



an instant the quiet deliberate form of
henry arnaud had become the swift
active shadow 

  his right fist swung upward it
caught the startled leader squarely on
the chin the vigilante toppled back-
ward with a gargling gasp the shadow
was upon him with one quick grasp
he plucked the gun from the vigilantes
nerveless hand

  the other men had dropped the girl
to meet the menace one raised his
hand to fire martha was upon him
clawing fiercely she thrust his arm
away the second man was slower
his arm was swinging toward the
shadow who was kneeling on the floor

  a quick shot came from the shad-
ows gun down went the vigilante
the man whom martha had attacked
was bringing his forearm downward
aiming the revolver martha had
gripped his shoulder but his free wrist
was trying to strike the girl senseless
with the weapon

  his head and body were obscured by
marthas form only his hand with its
gleaming gun was visible above the
girls head it was toward that hand
that the shadow fired his second shot

  his true aim found the mark the
descending wrist dropped and the gun
fell against marthas shoulder as it
clattered to the floor

   now came the new menace shots
were being fired from without from
places where they were in hiding four
more men leaped forward one spotted
the tall form of henry arnaud through
the door he fired but the shot was
wild

  the attackers were clambering toward
the porch with quick instinctive ac-
tion the shadow swung forward to
drag martha to a spot of safety for
the girl was standing stupefied beside
her ex-captor who was groveling on
the floor

  in seizing the girl the shadow used
  shad-a

his left arm the sudden pain that shot
through his shoulder made him falter

  the issue was in the balance four
men outside in the dark dropped be-
hind the outer rail of the porch their
forms visible from the street but not
from the lighted house could the
shadow swing the petrified girl to
safety

  alone he could have beaten back this
attack alone he could have dropped
to cover had the girl retained her
wits she could have helped by escaping
but her nerves had weakened under this
terrible strain

  it was a race with death and the
shadow weakened though he was
gained his objective with his right
arm he fairly hurled the girl into the
corner of the room away from the open
door with a plunging leap he dove
for the cover of the stairway

  bullets whizzed by him but they were
late the shadow reached his goal-
the gun-and pointed it through the
posts of the banister the shot dipped
the gun hand of a man on the porch

  the shadow was in a place of safety
here he could hold out against his foe-
men but he had only three bullets left
he was forced to harbor his supply for
his enemies were keeping under cover
firing quick chance shots to keep the
shadow at bay

  the shadow did not act it seemed
as though he was waiting for something
that he had expected his keen eyes
were peering toward the street he
saw a sedan drawing up beside the curb

  he fired two quick shots then paused
and fired a third the bullets found no
targets for the vigilantes were laying
low they saw the shadow rise as
though about to flee

  they knew that his ammunition was
exhausted they did not know that
those last futile shots had been a signal

up they rose four together the man
whose right hand had been clipped


the shadow magazine

       pointed the gun through the posts of the banister    clipped
the gun hand of the man   

brandishing a revolver in his left they
started for the steps bent on stopping
the flight of their enemy

   as their forms became clustered in
front of the light of the open door a
staccato popping of revolver shots came
irom the car beside the curb

 down went one attackcr-a second

and a third the fourth staggered on
he raised his hand to fire but the
shadow had swept in to meet him the
shadows arm smashed its revolver
against the last mans wrist then as
the fellow faltered the shadow smote
the back of his head a vicious stunning
blow
the shadow magazine



  down fell the last of the four

  the room was silent the revolver
shots from the parked automobile had
ended distant shouts were coming
through the air the shadow turned
to martha and his face became the
quiet countenance of henry arnaud
the girl stared in amazement

  it is seven minutes after nine-the
voice of henry arnaud was speaking
as the man glanced calmly at his watch
-and my men are here-later than i
anticipated they are waiting for you
in the car harry vincent and clifford
marsland they have come here from
new york go with them you must
not stay here

  martha nodded she understood the
shadows purpose people would think
there had been other vigilantes-that
she had been abducted and her com-
panion slain the gleaming eyes were
bidding her to go

  hurriedly the girl ran to the door-
down the walk to that waiting car
glancing over her shoulder she saw
henry arnauds form silhouetted in
the doorway his right hand giving a
signal

  the door of the car was open martha
was drawn in the car shot into gear
and whirled along the street

  shouts were approaching men were
coming along the street the shadow
quietly closed the door and locked it
he calmly picked up a revolver that
one of the wounded men was trying to
grasp with his left hand he chose
another weapon he pocketed both
guns and strode rapidly toward the
closet beneath the stairway

  the leader of the vigilantes stirred
he sat up and rubbed his jaw he
heard loud hammering at the door he
rose and dashed toward the rear of the
house anxious to escape before police
arrived

  the door was yielding some one
was crashing the glass in a front win-
dow from behind the stairway stepped

a black figure-the shadow garbed in
his cloak and hat

  he stood there calmly a strange im-
posing figure then from his hidden 
lips came a long sardonic laugh it
was the mirth of justice crying its tri-
umph over friends of crime

  swinging swiftly the shadow swept
away through a door that led toward
another room

  the entering men found only a crowd
of masked ruffians sprawled on the floor
-some dead the others very badly
wounded they saw no sign of the
black avenger

  for the shadow bent on further ac-
tion had vanished-gone into the gloom
of the night

chapter xxiv

thwarted crime

  that finishes the job

  it was judge who spoke the satisfied
words to harvey bronlon deacon
stooped near the wall closed the lid
of a packing case in which were stacked
piles of paper money

  the three were in the subterranean
strong room under harvey bronlons
garage the iron door was closed they
were safe there

  deacon clamped the cover of the last
packing case the big boxes stood in
a row beside a line of opened coffins
the transfer of a vast amount of cash
had been effected

  come on said bronlon

  he led the way from the room he
locked the iron door behind him the
three men walked through a long dark
passage back to the house then up a
flight of steps and at last arrived in
bronlons smoking room

  when critz calls up were all right
he declared with an insidious leer now
that the shadows taken care of our
game is safe

  we must speed matters however
declared judge with more than two


the shadow magazine

million tucked away i think it would
be best to let the security business ride
i think youre right returned bron-
lon i can get you that job in the east
at any time let the new president hold
the bag

  therell be real dough coming in all
along observed deacon

  yes agreed judge but weve
passed out so much of the queer that
well be getting too much of it back
there isnt much of the genuine left in
this neck of the woods

  it will be a while before the queer
gets spotted said deacon we did a
real job judge you cant beat the en-
graving work it looks like it came
from the government bureau all ex-
cept the numbers theyre duplicates of
good bills major knew his paper
that makes it perfect butcher really
did an exceedingly good job too-on

the printing-

  he paused reflectively then added

  i hated to see those plates drop over-
board in the caribbean it was like a
burial at sea i put plenty in them

judge-plenty-

  judge nodded and smiled he was
about to speak when an interruption oc-
curred-so sudden that neither he nor
deacon had an opportunity to move
from the room

  jake critz appointed leader of the
vigilantes came dashing into the smok-
ing room his eyes were wild as he
stopped in front of harvey bronlon
then seeing the others there he hesi-
tated panting

  what happened critz growled
bronlon never mind whos here
tell me-quick

  he got away blurted critz him
and the girl both of them we had
him but he managed to sock me one
and the other fellows fell down on the
job theyre laying there-at delmars
-half of them dead

  bronlons huge form slumped in its

chair judge seemed stunned dea-
cons face was long and melancholy

  it will get traced to me sure
groaned critz when they see who
the crowd is-well the cops will be on
my track sure

  bronlon was nodding but judge in-
terrupted

  that wont happen for a while
bronlon he said quietly theres no
reason why they should look for critz
right away vigilantes are illegal but
they have so many to take care of that
it will be some time before they think
about others critz must get out to-
night

  bronlon nodded

  he can go in one of your trucks
added judge in an easy tone let him
take that shipment of boxes from the
strong room so it will look as though
he is doing business for you mr best
here-judge indicated deacon-can
go along to help him that will aid
him in his escape

  bronlon saw the shrewdness of the
scheme apparently critz would have
fled in a stolen truck at the same
time the money would be taken away
it would be safe at its place of con-
cealment long before the police began
to seek jake critz the flight of the
man would also clear suspicion from the
name of harvey bronlon

  well help you out of this critz
declared bronlon it will mean money
for you too enough so you can travel
and keep away from here go down to
the garage and get the big truck bring
it to the garage speak to no one
critz nodding eagerly hastened from
the room judge arose and motioned to
his companions

  under the garage he said that
is where we belong

  the three men descended they went
through the passage and entered the
strong room deacon unbarred the side
door that led toward the delivery drive
seated on the boxes the men discussed
the shadow magazine



in low tones the strange turn that events
had taken

  were rid of the shadow for the
time declared judge with emphasis
he was lucky to escape he cant try
anything now the danger is down at
the bank-and in the undertaking estab-
lishment it may be best to let deacon
stay away let everything be discov-
ered my name and yours are safe
bronlon the bad money will pass for
good-	

  suppose the shadow gets in and
rifles the vault  said deacon

  ill go down as soon as we arc
through here said judge thoughtfully
if that has happened i shall have to
get out of town too as for bron-
lon-

  he stopped short critz was enter-
ing from the drive the mail came in
through a passage that led to the side
door of the strong room the three
stood up and deacon hurriedly pre-
pared to help critz in the lifting of
the first box

  a low laugh came from the inner
door of the room the four men
turned as one they found themselves
staring into the muzzles of two re-
volvers the guns were held by a man
in black

  the shadow cried judge

  up went the hands of the trapped
men there was no chance of escape
the shadow lowered his left arm with
a slight sign of weariness but the right
gun was sufficient as a threat

  the first to move will be the first
to die said the shadow

  his ominous voice sounded as an
echoed whisper in that subterranean
room

  your game is ended bronlon de-
clared the shadow coldly a man
of wealth you squandered much of your
gains you needed a way to make up
for your losses and to net millions in
addition

  so you chose a group of clever
crooks the five chameleons they
called themselves like the chameleon
that curious lizard of the tropics they
could change their appearances and their
manners to adapt themselves to the re-
quirements you desired

  now three of the five chameleons
are dead the two who remain are
trapped here with you they are the
survivors of a band of rogues

  all understood the menace of that
tone save jake critz he was be-
wildered and stupefied he did not
recognize this amazing being as the one
he had temporarily captured at del-
mars

  a clever scheme declared the
shadow the fruit of many years
work-to be plucked one short week i
know the names of your five
chameleons i know the names they
called themselves

  judge-deacon-these two are here
major-ferret-butcher-those three
lie dead four were convicted men
your influence secretly released them
from prison before their terms were
served

  you sent them away-ten years ago
-four of the cleverest counterfeiters in
the land they spent a life of ease and
luxury cruising in tropical lands picked
up at intervals by the yacht that you
had ready to serve them

  while they played they worked
they prepared plates and printed mil-
lions of dollars of the most perfect
counterfeit notes that have ever been
produced those were smuggled into
the country-by airplane i presume
the false money then was sent to mid-
dletown-shipped here in an order of
caskets

  i knew nothing of it snarled bron-
lon

  the shadow laughed

that block you built he said the
block arranged to house middletowns
banks-with a passage underneath it

to the undertaking establishment it
served your chameleons well

  one-this man who calls himself
judge-had no criminal record he
was here and prosperous he knew
the banking business he was familiar
with the vault in the national bank as
well as the one in his own bank

  his campaign began with the bleed-
ing of the other bank thousands of
dollars were removed-taken from the
county national bank and stowed in
the vault of the trust company two
murders proved necessary wellington
was killed hubert salisbury was
framed roland delmars death was
made to appear a suicide the run be-
gan the national bank failed

  then into the coffers of your con-
trolled bank poured all the resources of
this territory for every dollar of good
paper money your chameleons had a
dollar of the queer bad money for
good

  the vault of the middletown trust
company holds more cash than its books
show but none of the money is real
the millions pilfered from the public
lies in those boxes-ready for a ship-
ment that will never take place

  bronlon groaned the others were
silent

  your pay rolls bronlon the bonus
you gave-all in counterfeit notes
money-cash-drawn into middletown
that you and your fellow crooks might
reap a mighty harvest

  the shadow paused a laugh again
echoed from his lips he spoke now
slowly and emphatically

  i trust that i have not wearied you
-his tones were cold and ironical-
for the knowledge that i possess is no
news to you i have been forced to pass
a little while with you here we are
waiting-waiting for the officers whom
i have summoned to this place

  the voice of the shadow was drag-
ging his efforts had been great to-

  night he was still a wounded man
a feeling of dizziness was coming over
him his body swayed and almost top-
pled

  judge-keen in the face of danger-
realized the reason this was his
chance like a tiger he sprang for-
ward to attack the shadow

  the sudden thrust brought back the
shadows fading strength he raised
his right arm as judge fell upon him
the revolver barked judges body
rolled upon its back the shadows
shot had reached his heart

  bronlon leaped forward critz joined
him deacon was drawing his revolver

  had bronlon and his henchman not
made their wild attack deacon could
have shot the shadow but now the
shadow was beneath his enemies his
revolver fired muffled shots the men
on the floor were writhing as deacon
dashed to their aid

  one patch of that black form was
all that deacon wanted it came to
view as bronlons heavy body slumped
to one side but as deacon saw his op-
portunity the hand of the shadow
lifted with its gleaming revolver

  twice the finger pressed the trigger
before deacon had a chance to fire
and then the fifth chameleon dropped
in his tracks

  the shadow slowly pushed aside the
body of jake critz with his right hand
the figure of vengeance raised itself to
its feet the shadow arose a motion-
less figure of belated justice

  on the floor lay judge and deacon
dead bronlon was groaning moving
feebly critz was gasping his hands
clasped against his side

  slowly and painfully the shadow
walked from the strong room faltering
on toward the reviving air thin gray
wreaths of revolver smoke clouded his
black-cloaked form then he was
gone out into the darkness the scene
of death lay waiting for the forces of
the law
the shadow magazine



  the last of the five chameleons had
perished-by the hand of the shadow
alone he had ended the careers of the
quintet of notorious criminals

  with the forms of judge and dea-
con lay the writhing bulk of harvey
bronlon the millionaire crook who had
financed the game of crime

chapter xxv

justice wins

  all middletown was amazed by the
revelations that followed the end of the
five chameleons the first inkling of
their dastardly work had been the find-
ing of the dead and crippled vigilantes
in the home of martha delmar

  then came a phone call that led po-
lice to harvey bronlons strong room
they found the bodies of judge and
deacon jake critz was dying har-
vey bronlon was suffering from wounds
from which he died two days later

  had the hand of the shadow pur-
posely allowed this man to live a
while that might have been the mas-
ter fighters design for harvey bron-
lon taken with the cases of well-packed
bills and gold certificates weakened un-
der the quizzing of his captors

  it was he who gasped out the con-
fession of the crime-virtually the story
which the shadow had recounted when
he had held his last foes at bay bron-
lon cowed by impending death told of
the secret passage in the block that he
had built

  the investigators found the bodies of
major ferret and butcher they were
laid in the morgue and with them were
placed the forms of judge and dea-
con

  the five chameleons united in the
room which they had used as base of
operations together there in life
they were together now in death

  the money at bronlons was brought
back to the vault of the county national
bank state officials arrived to take

charge government men came to mid-
dletown to investigate the spurious
money that had flooded the entire dis-
trict

 while the bodies of the five
chameleons lay on their slabs some un-
known hand placed envelopes there-
one on the form of each man the
officer who discovered the envelopes
opened them one by one

  each contained the pretended name
of the victim upon which it had lain
david traver howard best maurice
exton joel hawkins george ells-
worth all were listed but as the of-
ficer stared at the writing an unex-
plainable change took place the writ-
ing faded and new words immediately
appeared

  the nicknames judge deacon ma-
jor ferret and butcher were revealed
by the invisible hand these names
gave the government agents a working
clew they quickly dug up the past
records of all the notorious crooks

  that was not the only strange episode
that followed the clean-up of the coun-
terfeiters the other was observed by
only one other person-martha del-
mar

  she was back in middletown the
truth of her fathers suicide was ex-
plained for the first sheet of his last
note had been found in bronlons home
the girls friends had all returned she
had forgotten the past

  why not hubert salisburys story
had been substantiated by the finding of
the secret passage the young man was
free-and he and martha delmar cele-
brated his release by a wedding

  it was among the many gifts received
that martha observed the strange token
a beautiful clock-the finest of all the
gifts-stood upon the mantelpiece it
had come without the donors card ail
wondered who had sent it and only
martha knew

  for in the evening when the lamps


the shadow magazine

above the mantelpiece were lighted the
tall clock threw an odd mysterious
shadow on the floor before the fire-
place

  it was the shadow of a tall slender
form that terminated in the silhouette
of a face with a hawklike nose the
broad brim of a slouch hat above the
profile

  it was the shadow of the shadow
like the flashing girasol a symbol that

martha delmar could never forget it
told more graphically than words the
identity of the donor who had sent the
valuable gift

  martha looked at the shadow often
it brought back a weird memory it
spoke of that eventful night when the
shadow himself had come in response
to her call

blood froze at the sight of

the face

by hamilton craigie

  frane halted in the tamaracks at the
waters edge to stare upward at the
house

  it was early dusk of a summer eve-
ning-and it may have been the quiet
or the somehow sinister commingling of
the sky and air-but it seemed to the
detective as he beheld the house that
there was something unnatural about it
squat and sinister with its round roof
low-hung above the piles on which the
house rested it was like the shape of a
toad on stilts

  behind him was the lagoon with in

the distance the diminishing put-put of
the motor boat which had brought him
from penns landing across the lake

  there was a finality in the sound of
that motor as if it put a period or an
exclamation mark upon the words of
the native who had ferried the detec-
tive across the lake

  a queer place mister an you can lay
to that lonely sure-but it aint that

  an th feller thats bought it-
u-m-m-well i was forgettin it he was
a friend of yours but the house-
when you get there mister youll see
 

the shadow magazine

  the man had waited to say all this
until he had landed frane at the decrepit
wharf and he was some distance away
with the sound of the motor like thun-
der in that narrow place before frane
thought to question him

  there was yet a good light to see
by but it was not until the investigator
had reached the wharfs landward end
that he was able to see the house

  and there with an abrupt queer ac-
cession of a something that was very
close to fear he now stood to stare at
it with the dark tamaracks around him

  the flat black shape of the automatic
hung in a sling beneath his left armpit
should have given him a measure of
reassurance-if there had been anything
to fear and four-minute frane
was anyway hard-boiled

  when not on duty he did not usually
carry a gun he was not at that mo-
ment on duty and he had come on a
visit to peter farquhar his friend-but
he carried his gun

  nevertheless in spite of the fact that
he had come armed with a purpose he
had a feeling in the circumstances that
a pistol would be of very little use

  why-he could not exactly have told
for it was the sight of that house-
the shape of it-and a something that
looked out of it that held him stand-
ing there staring at it with his hand
fumbling for the pistol beneath his coat

  but most of all it was a quick fear
for his friend that he felt as he stared
upward a fear which he confessed to
himself he had not felt on the receipt
of the message of the day before

  john come quick and be prepared
  for trouble ill explain when i see you
  but-hurry it came again to-day

                                 petek

  hie letter had come special delivery
and at first frane had hardly recognized
the handwriting it was in a queer al-
most indecipherable scrawl

  apart from the fact that he was un-
der heavy obligation to farquhar he
was his friend and immediately upon
receipt of the letter the detective had
packed a bag and set out

  frane knew that his friend worked
often tinder a strain and that he had
bought the house because it would be
quiet and remote

  perhaps frane thought farquhar
might have had some sort of attack-
a recurrent shell-shock that was what
he might have meant by it physical
violence was the last thing the detective
had considered that was why he had
not been unduly concerned

  still there had been that reference
to trouble on that account he had
packed a pistol for in his particular
profession he knew that almost any-
thing can happen-and frequently does

  frane knew that as a chemist and
physicist farquhar had gone rather
deeply into hyper-spaces and the disin-
tegration of the atom his monograph
on nuclei had created a profound stir

  for himself the detective professed
to understand little about such matters
but to have been struck by a remark of
farquhars that there was nothing es-
sentially repugnant philosophically in
bilocation for instance-i e the actual
possibility of an individual being in two
places at once

  farquhar was a mind an intellect
frane had sense enough to perceive this
at the same time wondering at the fact
that farquhar should have chosen for
a friend a man with such a practically
unintellectual occupation as himself

  but at the moment he was concerned
chiefly with what he saw and the sight
of it in the dusky air was somehow not
reassuring

  the windows like blind eyes were
shuttered with shutters that were like
heavy slabs they gave to that squat
house with its shape of a toad on stilts
the appearance of a fort besieged

  his friend had been expecting him
the shadow magazine



which made the matter even the more
strange and it was then as frane
stared upward at those shuttered win-
dows that all at once he felt the flesh
of his spine prickle e short hairs at
the back of his neck ijise with what he
saw

  the shutter nearest the door was
swinging open inch by careful inch it
moved slowly deliberately

  and then he saw the face

   thrust out at an angle it appeared
to hang for a moment like a head with-
out a body it seemed not to be look-
ing at him but beyond in the direc-
tion of the lagoon

   it was not farquhars the detective
was certain although the light had by
now faded to a graying shadow and he
could not describe its expression save
as an inhuman mask of evil

  it seemed to gloat and yet at the
same time to be looking for something
or somebody beyond him and to his
left

   if there was anything otherwise dis-
tinctive about it frane should have said
 that it had a slightly foreign look

   and in one penetrating flash it came
to him that the thing his friend feared
was it that he had barricaded himself
against it but had failed that it had
either made away with him or if it had
not already done so was watching now
aware of franes coming-with what
purpose it would be easy for any one
to guess

  and as if the thought had body in
it of a sudden the face jerked round
frane saw the eyes widen then narrow
upon him in a dreadful squint

  a hand holding an automatic was
thrust from the embrasure there came
the flat crack of the report even as the
wind of the bullet kissed franes cheek
in passing

  at the instant frane had dropped
prone he heard the echoing clang as
the heavy shutter was slammed to then

what sounded like the skirl of a heavy
bolt

  then as he leaped upright there came
a sound like the patter of leaves in a
dead wind after that silence-silence
in which the air seemed suddenly op-
pressive hard to breathe

  jerking loose his own gun from its
shoulder holster frane charged the
house ordinarily he would have used
discretion but the shuttered windows
and the face with its grinning malevo-
lence had been a challenge he crashed
into and through the door

  the force of his rush had sent him
staggering inward a half dozen paces
even as he realized that the door had
been open it had not even been latched

  if the thing had been a trick how-
ever a device to get him inside he had
so far been unmolested the owner of
the face whoever or whatever he might
be was not in evidence yet he might
conceivably be lurking in the shadows
it might be well to have a line of re-
treat

  there came a click like the cocking
of a gun it was almost as if a pres-
ence there had read franes thought
he wheeled-to find that the door had
closed shut behind him without sound

  he remembered a story he had once
read and never forgotten an empty
room and the villain hiding in it and
then the dick at the keyhole as he was
locked in from outside

  in a kind of panic he was ashamed to
own he sprang to open it somehow
he knew that he would find it locked

  inside the darkness was like a wolfs
throat outside a wind had arisen like
the voices of uneasy ghosts-and of a
sudden the shutters all round the house
shook as if in the grasp of an impa-
tient angry hand

  a dog-fox barked in the timbers the
melancholy whoo-whoo of a horned owl
answered him and then the long hoot
of a freight loco from the hills

  with his hand upon the doorknob
the shadow magazine

frane froze suddenly a step had
sounded from the shadows at the rear
it was more like the vibration of some
soundless weight

  he jerked at the knob turning it-
and the door swung open without sound
it was a door-check that had closed it
but for a moment frane remembered
only an inhuman ruthless face

  by now it had become black dark
producing his pocket flash and holding
his pistol in readiness the detective be-
gan the circuit of the house

  the front door opened on a living
room on both sides of which were bed-
rooms one of which had been fitted
up as a laboratory

  the flash gleamed and glimmered
upon test tube and retort and for a mo-
ment frane had a feeling and with it
a recurrence of a nameless dread that
it might be-a laboratory of souls

  perhaps his friend had ibuilded better
than he knew to create a frankenstein
a robot as a physicist he might even
have been able to make him invisible--
such things might be and yet the face
that he had seen had been visible

  he wheeled-and a black shadow fled
along the wall in the flashlights beam
it appeared to have neither form nor
substance he felt the furry touch of
it in passing and recoiled

  he laughed as the cat fled past him
disappeared but he was relieved that
he had seen it-for what it was

  he began his exploration of the
house living room laboratory and
bedroom-there was no one there

  opening off the living room toward
the rear was the dining room with a
lean-to kitchen at the right it had a
shallow loft which after the detec-
tives search of the living room and the
two other rooms he in turn examined
with the same result there remained
only the dining room and the kkchen

  but all this while as he had gone
from room to room he had a strong

impression of a presence at his elbow-
stopping when he stopped and moving
when he moved hard-boiled as he
might call himself he had felt for a
moment like the boy in the poem who
on a lonely road feared to turn his head
because he knew that if he did so he
would see the fiend who followed

  and it came to him as he went from
room to room with the beam of his
flashlight on ahead that if he should
turn round quickly he would see some-
thing-well not good

  and in obedience to an impulse which
he could not restrain between dining
room and kitchen he whirled-and there
was no one there

  was not had been because he could
have sworn in the flashlights beam to
a leaping shadow upon floor and wall
the shadow of a something that had been
there a tenth of a second before his
quick pivot

  it seemed that he moved like a shadow
in a world of shadows alone and yet
not alone in a house empty save for
a presence moving in darkness a thing
silent as death and he was convinced
as terrible borrowing its tokens from
the invisible air he reached a match
to a candle on the table and lighted it
the faint light eased him slightly

  but where was peter farquhar his
friend

  frane did not allow himself to specu-
late

  he moved forward into the kitchen
kicking in the door with his foot-and
the roaring crash of an explosion came
with the stunning impact of a knock-
down blow

  something seemed to burst in his
brain with a singing crash he was fall
ing sliding down a long stairway of
dreams-into unconsciousness

  the detective came to himself like
a swimmer rising from green depths
far down he had no means of know-
ing how long he had been out get-
the shadow magazine



ting unsteadily to his feet he swayed
for a moment

  it had been no ghost assuredly who
had handed him that tremendous wallop
at any rate whoever or whatever it had
been he or it had not followed up the
advantage he still had his flash and
pistol

  and in the candles light he saw that
kicking open that door instead of open-
ing it in the usual manner had in all
likelihood saved his life

  a shotgun had been hung on two
heavy nails driven into the wall so that
at the height of a mans head it com-
manded the doorway in flank and a
stout wire had been rove from the trig-
gers to the knob

  the devilish ingenuity of the thing
france could appreciate a man open-
ing the door especially in darkness and
feeling the tension of the obstructing
wire would exert the necessary pressure
on it to pull either or both triggers
thinking of course that the door had
caught	

  and it would have been the last thing
he would have ever done for by then
he would- have been just far enough
across the threshold to have been in
direct line with the discharge

  the detective had kicked open the
door while still out of range it had
been the doors rebound from the wire
with the repercussion which had laid
him low

  but the point was if this had been
designed for him why go to all this
trouble when a shot from behind would
have done it

  but he was pretty sure that it had
not been meant for him for further
proof of the diabolic cunning which had
set that trap was afforded by sight of
the barricaded rear door

  the man or the fiend who had shot
at frane from the window had entered
the bungalow in the absence of his
friend he had barricaded the rear
door so that farquhar returning-and

the thing rested on the presumption that
farquhar was in the habit of using the
rear entrance-would have to go round
to the front

  naturally he would have investigated
via the kitchen with the result as
planned and which had nearly claimed
its victim in frane himself

  on a table against the window was
the remainder of a meal or rather evi-
dence of a repast broken almost as soon
as it had begun

  could it have been that frane by his
coming had interrupted the thing that
had appeared at the window

  it was a mystery to which the detec-
tive had not the key for one thing
why should the creature having at-
tacked him flee at his coming or why
if he had not fled and remained even
then with him somewhere in the house
had he not ambushed him before now

  the detective had felt its presence
like a malign and sinister cloud upon
the night ghost or devil or maniac or
what-you-will he felt it as a peril the
more dangerous because unknown

  it was when frane noticed that the
candle was beginning to pale that he
realized that it was morning he had
been in that house of fear all night
that knock-out had lasted far longer
than he had supposed

  but his head felt disproportionately
queer and a glimmer of white on the
table furnished him the clew that-
and a faint lessening odor sickish-
sweet the paper had writing on it
in a neat clerkly hand

  to the uninvited guest

  the shotgun was an accident it was
  not meant for you but the chloroform
  from the effects of which you have just
  awakened was not an accident i spared
  you so that you will understand and
  so-leave this house when you read this
  or-you will never leave it-alive as for
  him he has so far eluded me but he can-
  not escape me i will find him-i will
  search him out


the shadow magazine

  it was unsigned

  his friend frane realized was so
far safe still in spite of a certain
familiarity with danger which was his
trade frane shivered a little to think
of himself at the mercy of an insane
potential murderer-for such he now
believed this thing to be-and alive
merely at the moment by his whim

  it was not exactly reassuring to think
that the thing had stood over him de-
bating doubtless whether or not to
finish what he had begun

  but where was farquhar

  and as if in answer to the question
there came a quick silent pressure upon
the rear door from without the knob
turned frane could see it turning and
again he was aware of a swift inward
chill

  in two strides he reached the door
jerked up the heavy bar then with
drawn pistol stood a little to one side

  whos there  he croaked in a voice
that he did not recognize as his own
against the slow daylight the doorway
showed merely as a gray glimmering
oblong then after a moment out of
it like the development of a negative
there grew a face

  lined and old it was like the face of
an old man

  it was farquhar

  he threw up his hands when he saw
the detective and his body shivered like
a man in a fit

  no-no-no he began muttering
his mouth pulled sidewise as from a
tic no-no-no

  it is not pleasant to see a man stripped
bare to the elemental raw fear at his
marrow and if ever frane saw fear
in a mans face it was in farquhars
frane put out his hand

  and then all at once into the gray
face there came an odd baffled look it
was followed by a sudden vicious glare
of comprehension as if he saw frane
for the first time

  it was the look the detective had seen
on occasion in the face of an ordinarily
mild man transformed by alcohol as
if some dweller on the threshold say
had for the moment arisen to peer out-
ward from some stronghold deep down

  there came a sound from his lips that
was like a grunting snarl his hand
flashed down then up but as the gun
swung level frane ducked under it
grabbing for his arm

  pete-snap out of it its me-
john cried frane

  farquhars face changed it was as
if he had put off a mask

  why so it is he said slowly but
its i john not me rut its you
anyway isnt it-thats good

  you see-ive been out-away he
continued vaguely i dont remember

leaving-somehow- the words

blurred for a moment they told me
-the place was haunted-when i took
it i should have known

  he slumped heavily into a chair head
lolling he acted a good deal like a man
drunk but frane could detect no trace
of alcohol as with some difficulty he
managed to get him to bed and after
seeing to it that the doors and windows
were locked and double locked the de-
tective lay down on a couch in the liv-
ing room to make up his own arrears

  it was dark when both awoke but as
a matter of fact frane had awakened a
little ahead and in the interim before
farquhars waking the detective had
gone outside for a moment for a look-
see

  for one thing there was no grass
immediately outside the windows but
mud loam rather on which frane
was careful not to walk he found
farquhar awake and dressed when he
returned

  the detective was shocked at his ap-
pearance but did not remark it nor did
he mention his experiences of the night
nor what he had but that moment dis-
covered outside in the loam
the shadow magazine



  a ghost always provided you be-
lieved in such things would not make
footprints and yet believers in such
manifestations looked always for phys-
ical effects

  ghosts tipped tables touched hands
wrote messages if so why not foot-
prints well and why not

  frane sat and listened and watched
farquhars hands

  they were the hands of a man ac-
customed to the delicate manipulation
of alembic and retort long spatulate
and nervously sensitive and alive yet
strong and capable for farquhar had
been-was yet-a man of exceptional
physical strength

  but the detective could see plainly
enough as his friend talked that he was
in a very bad way his strength sapped
by this incubus that had ridden him he
told frane for a week prior to the writ-
ing of the note

  it began-about a week ago said
farquhar heavily i had just finished
a particularly difficult piece of work
it had rained all day and the evening
had set in clear and cool

  at first it began with an unaccount-
able depression but i put it down to
the natural let-up after my work of the
week before and my liver had been
acting up a little-well that night there
was a full moon and i had opened my
bedroom window to look at it and it
was then i saw it-the footprint in the
loam

  he paused

  i wouldnt have thought anything in
particular of that except that i saw it
again in the same place the following
evening then-things began happen-
ing rather fast

  he was speaking jerkily now some-
what slurring his words as a man will
when drunk but franes friend was
not drunk-with alcohol that he knew

  it had come on to rain as the two
talked a shutter creaked and the long

wild laughter of the winds fled past the
dripping eaves farquhar shivered and
in the warm room it was the reverse
of cold

  i had no idea-havent now-who it
might be he continued even when i
found the note i have no enemies that
i know of-and here i have saved them
all

  he brought out five or six slips of
paper from his pocket

  well-the first one i found under
my pillow in the morning and there
was no possible way it could have gotten
there because both front and back doors
were locked

  but when i found the second note-
in my pocket-i closed and bolted the
heavy window shutters and sat up half
the night-with the same result

  the third note i found not only in
my pocket but inside my wallet the
next night i sat up all night with the
exception of perhaps five minutes when
i must have dozed-and there it was
on the table in plain sight

  he paused again spreading his hands
wide in a hopeless gesture

  whoever or whatever it is he con-
tinued he was not content with notes
he began setting traps the first was
a heavy weight hung over the outside
kitchen door

  he must have known that i used
that door almost invariably instead of
the front one it missed me by an inch
and i had locked that door on going
out double locked it in fact and i
had made sure before leaving that he
-it-was nowhere in the house

  his voice sank to a muttered mumble
so that frane had difficulty in catching
the words

  he took to rattling the windows but
it may have been the wind-tapping at
the pane but try as i might i could
never catch him he was too infernally
clever well now i wonder-and
john do you believe in ghosts

  no said frane but you mean


the shadow magazine

that youve never seen-whatever it
was he asked

  farquhar shook his head

  never--not once john he told
him and with myself on watch here
in the house and with the doors and
windows bolted and double locked he
has been able to effect an entrance-
how

  you are a cleverer man than i think
you are if you can figure it out of
course i could have gone to the police
but i knew what they would say be-
sides if it came to that-and it has-
i knew i could depend on you

  the wind in the chimney shouted
with the voice of a giant it shivered
abruptly to a wail it seemed to frane
that farquhar kept hold of himself with
an effort his face that had been pale
was now flushed the knuckles of his
firm delicately strong hands white with
their pressure upon the arms of his
chair

  its-coming-to-night-i can feel
it he cried harshly its coming but
ili meet it-halfway

  his voice had thickened oddly to a
sort of growling shriek then before
frane could think even farquhar had
snatched up a revolver rushed into the
night

  frane followed after with what
speed he might as he went he felt
for the pistol in his pocket the gun in
his shoulder holster he had not drawn

  whatever it might be beast man
or devil or unsubstantial ghost he
meant to be ready for it although a
pistol would seem a puny thing against
a thing armed as it might be with
weapons beyond human ken

  but somehow it seemed to the de-
tective that a pistol loaded let us say
with silver bullets might be the potent
charm

  the rain had gone with the wind and
a hunters moon was riding as frane
raced onward along the forest path it

made a mist in which the imagined ob-
ject seemed the more real

  and in this mist of moonlight it
seemed to frane that the theories that
he had formed-and they were two-
were no more bizarre than the flat black
shape of the automatic in his shoulder
holster or the pistol in the pocket of
his coat

  farquhar had not had more than a
half minutes start of him yet he was
nowhere in sight but the detective
knew that he had gone this way in the
fleeting instant that he had seen him
from the house

   judged in the light of day the theories
that frane had formed would have been
fantastic absurd but in the moonlight
that was like a fabric of dreams they
seemed no more fantastic than at the
moment seemed the curious fluidity of
the ground sliding backward beneath
his feet like a dark river flowing or by
the same token the thickening of the
moonlight like a web

  then for a moment far ahead he
saw a black figure running it leaped
forward like a runner at the tape across
the black-barred shadows of the tree
trunks beneath the moon it disap-
peared

  and then where the path foreshort-
ened to a wedge of gloom there came
a sound that was like nothing human
-he was too late

  out into the leprous shining of the
moon there moved a shambling figure
high-humped and frane could have
sworn that it went for a moment on all
fours

  like a thing that out of dreams has
taken form and substance it came on-
ward disappeared then-and frane
could have swom that it had cast no
 shadow-full in the moonlight he saw
the grinning evil face

  it was the face that had peered at
him from the window there could be
no mistake

   frane could not say that it ran it
                     shad-a
the shadow magazine



scuttled in motion like a gigantic spider
or a crab

  it saw him at the same instant that
he jerked loose his pocket pistol man
or devil loprechaun or ghost it knew

  then even as he fired point-blank at
it it disappeared and out of the black
belt of shadow staggered-farquhar-
to fall prone

  frane stared speechless the spell
of that forest had come upon him he
had shot his friend

  the thing had been real-as real as
the patient frane was ministering to an
hour later in the bungalow by the
lagoon

  the patient was farquhar whom he
had shot by some inexplicable mis-
chance you may say-shot with his
ammonia pistol which did not fire bul-
lets and which frane kept to use on
occasion against mad dogs it had been
meant for the monster or so frane con-
ceived him to be

  that had been one of his theories
the other-

  the other was expounded for him
presently by the man who just then
came through the bungalow door frane
saw poor farquhars eyes brighten

  ah-doctor mandeville he cried

  it was doctor mandeville who occu-
pied the neighboring bungalow he
was a tall spare man with a curiously
ravaged countenance his high dome-
like forehead a milk-white by contrast
with his forking red beard

  for a physician it struck frane that
as the doctor attended his friend he
did not do so in an entirely professional
calm and the detective was fascinated
by his hands huge and gnarled and
powerful for so spare a man

  farquhar in a weak voice explained
what had happened

  the physician gave a sympathetic
cluck with his tongue

  ah said he the tips of his fingers
held judicially together i think i un-

 shad- a

derstand--ah yes we may say per-
fectly as we say of quite ordinary
cases you-ah-you had no enemy but
-yourself

  he paused and frane fancied that he
heard the throb of a motor boat from
far out on the lake it came again as
doctor mandeville resumed

  what i mean by that he continued
with a nod toward the detective is that
mr farquhar has been the victim of
a dual personality overwork and un-
dernourishment-they were the cause

  and you mean to say that he set all
those traps rapped on the windows
and wrote all those notes-for himself v
questioned frane

  precisely mandeville answered
it is fantastic unusual if you will
but yet not so very unusual in my

experience-

  -in your experience frane re-
peated for him it is-it would be-
very ingenious said the detective
slowly and then he leaned forward
a little in his place very ingenious-
if true

  for a breathing instant there was a
vibrant silence out of the tail of his
eye frane could see farquhars aghast
expression then the look of repulsion
as he beheld mandevilles face

  lips drawn backward from the teeth
in a savage snarl it was the face frane
had seen peering at him from the win-
dow for now it was wholly evil the
mask withdrawn and then before the
detective could so much as move
mandeville was upon him like a tiger
in a sudden lunge

  his gun crashed almost in franes
face but a tenth of a second in advance
the detective ducked under it uppercut-
ting him full on the point

  the man staggered caved collapsing
in a huddle on the floor from which
frane jerked him upward to his feet
fastened the darbies on him then
propped him in his chair


the shadow magazine

  there came a heavy double rap at the
portal it burst inward with a slatting
clatter as two men entering together
saluted frane

  we got your wire sir an we been
cornin hell-bent yeah-its professor
anthony like you said

  the asylum keepers moved forward
together as the bound man snarled

  franes gaze was thoughtful for he
had not been quite sure he had sent
the wire but not until he had seen the
footprints beneath the window which
had given him his clew these and the
newspaper story in which he had read
of the mans escape from the asylum
had dovetailed in a curious pattern of
light and shade

  because the maniac had made those
footprints beneath the window at first
to devil farquhar and then for franes
benefit using farquhars shoes the
fact of the matter had been he was
some thirty pounds lighter than far-
quhar it had been the shallowness of
the impressions that had so to speak
impressed detective frane at the first
go off

  by such apparent trifles does one ar-
rive at the truth

  farquhar had been acquainted with
the man-by correspondence he had
never seen him as professor anthony
although the two had been working on
the same problem along the same lines
here at the bungalow he knew him
only as doctor mandeville the tenant
of the bungalow beyond the woods

  but the mystery of the notes found
in farquhars pockets was not so cav-
alierly explained until in company with
one of the asylum keepers the detective
found an old disused trapdoor with
the remains of what had once been a
landing stage used when the lake had
been higher than now

  it was easy to reconstruct the pic-
ture the madman driving farquhar
out of his house and watching for it
to be empty or by night using the an-

cient trapdoor stealing upward like
mephisto to set the stage

  the diabolical and yet illogical cun-
ning that had planted the idea of a
haunted house in the mind of franes
motor boatman had also rented the other
bungalow to be near farquhar deviled
him almost into a like madness with
malice aforethought and then set traps
for him in his absence

  all these things were explained only
by the theory and the fact as frane
now knew it that it was no fourth
dimensional horror no dual soul but
a madman in actual truth with whom
he had had to deal

  the shooting through the window
might have been on impulse whether or
no it was but another indication of a
madness that did not operate always ac-
cording to plan

  it had been the sight of farquhars
footprints which at first had led the
detective astray in the belief that his
friend might after all be the victim of
a dual personality for it had been an-
thonys design to make farquhar believe
that on its face

  and it was not till then that the de-
tective had walked overland to penns
landing to send his wire and had re-
turned that way in some trepidation as
to what he might find he had accom-
plished this at night returning just prior
to farquhars awakening with the re-
sults as seen

  and the motive-fantastic or not in-
credible or not was a motive that has
actuated man from the beginning the
very ordinary one of jealousy

  in this case of professional and sci-
entific jealousy fed and fostered by the
fact that of the two working toward
the same result farquhar had beaten
him for anthony brilliant mind
housed in an insufficient body it had
been too much culminating as it did
in a gradually increasing madness which
had ended nearly in the murder of not
one man but two

the black patch

  by f a m webster

  it was an unusually drowsy summer
afternoon one of those days when
nothing seems to be happening yet you
expect that anything might happen

  a b crisp whose initials had
prompted his fellow members at head-
quarters to title him alphabet was
walking down fifth avenue quite at
ease having no severe duties on hand
he was in hopes of finding patsy
piers whose attempts at selling bonds
alphabet realized often tired him out
early in the afternoon driving him to
the club

  but even as alphabet was thus medi-
tating he was startled by the staccato
rattle of a perfect fusillade of revolver
shots his eyes turned instantly toward

the sound on the opposite side of the
street

  a uniformed officer doing his beat
had just fallen to the pavement three
men came dashing out of a big jewelry
store and rushed into a big racing car
the car immediately roared into action
turning toward sixth avenue and cut-
ting down between the pillars of the
elevated tracks

  alphabet dashed across the street
dodging the snarled-up traffic miracu-
lously as he ran he thrust his way
through the crowd which had already
gathered around the fallen policeman
and entered the showroom of hammer-
son jewelers from which the escaping
men had come


the shadow magazine

  the interior of the showroom pre-
sented a strange spectacle no damage
seemed to have been done but several
salesmen were stjjl cowering down be-
hind the counters

  one of the men held an antiquated
service revolver in a very shaky hand
while three others were just raising a
lady who appeared to have fallen to the
floor in a dead faint

  alphabet surveyed the scene for a
minute then turned to an officer who
had followed him into the shop

  shut that door and keep it shut
alphabet ordered him showing his de-
tectives badge and see that no one
goes in or out

  the officer stolidly set himself in the
doorway while alphabet hurried to the
office in the rear of the showroom where
the lady had been carried

  as she was stretched out upon the
davenport recovering from her shock
alphabet recognized her as lena ve-
dore society beauty and one of the
most bejeweled young women of her
set

  beside her was a tall black-bearded
man one of his keen gray eyes al-
phabet noticed was disfigured by
a very peculiar hazel wedge set in the
iris

  the man turned toward alphabet
with a questioning look he evidently
wanted an explanation of alphabets
presence

  headquarters the detective said as
he showed his badge detective crisp
just happened by when all the shooting
started ive a man at the door now
and ill take charge

  i am garside managing director of
hammersons- the mans sen-
tence was interrupted by a fluttering
sigh from the davenport where miss
vedore was struggling to sit up

  the man with the black patch he
-he fired a pistol at me she gasped
then in stronger voice of intense anx-

iety oh my diamonds mr garside
are they safe

the westwater diamonds gar-
side queried did you bring them
you know that i arranged to let you
have them to-day mr garside she
answered exasperated at the question

  wait a minute interrupted alpha-
bet suppose you tell me just what
happened young lady and no one
will interrupt lets get this straight
then maybe we can get somewhere on
the case

  lena vedore looked at alphabet in-
tensely for a moment then evidently
satisfied with her scrutiny spoke

  i came into this shop a few minutes
ago to deliver the westwater diamonds
to mr garside for resetting she ex-
plained as i entered a horrible-look-
ing man with a twisted lip and a black
patch over his right eye was standing
close to the door of this room

  this man turned toward me with
a pistol and fired then the shop
seemed to be filled with armed men
and several shots were fired in the
confusion my jewel case was snatched
from my hands then i think i must
have fainted

  i sec said alphabet was any
one aware that you were bringing the
westwater diamonds here this morn-
ing

  no one except mr garside she
answered he asked particularly that
i keep the matter a secret

  alphabet swung round upon the jew-
eler

  well mr garside

  what miss vedore has told you is
perfectly true mr crisp it is our
custom to take all possible precautions
to prevent people knowing when valu-
able jewels are about to be committed
to our care

  and in whom did you confide
asked alphabet

  not in a single soul garside re-
plied
the shadow magazine



  for a moment alphabet crisp hesi-
tated then he spoke again to the black-
bearded man

  will you tell me what you know
about the robbery

  certainly but im afraid i shant
help you very much gar side re-
sponded i was between the desk and
the door when the raiding began i
heard a scream and was reaching out my
hand to open the door when a shot was
fired so-er--im afraid i locked the
door and rang up the police

  and thats all you know mr gar-
side alphabet prompted

  yes-but my manager says-

  alphabet raised his hand

  one moment mr garside well
let the manager tell his own tale

  the manager entered visibly shaking
with fear and tremblingly confirmed
everything that miss vedore had re-
lated

  did you see the man who fired at
miss vedore alphabet asked him

  no sir the manager answered
the sound of the first shot alarmed
me i saw miss vedore drop a jewel
case and rushed to her assistance but
she had fallen in a faint and the case
had vanished before i could get round
the counter

  i dont understand why you didnt
see the man with the black patch mut-
tered alphabet

  the man with the black patch was
standing in deep shadow intervened
miss vedore he was between the
big grandfather clock and the portiere
which protects mr garsides door
thats queer muttered alphabet
thoughtfully none of the three men
who rushed out of the shop answered
that description and i didnt see any
one of them carrying anything how
big was your jewel case 

  quite large enough for you to have
seen if a man was carrying it it was
plain pigskin without initials or any
other mark the beauty answered

  but alphabet scarcely heard her last
words his roving glance had just come
to rest upon a strip of pinkish paper
which lay curled up on the carpet close
to the door

  the voice of miss vedore however
broke in upon his speculations when she
suddenly asked if that was all he re-
quired

  eh oh yes-yes-most certainly
that will be all and you can expect
to hear from us shortly he added en-
couragingly

  she arose and alphabet hurried to
open the door for her as he did so
his foot covered the scrap of paper he
escorted the young lady to the entrance
where he questioned the officer on
guard whether he had seen a man with
a twisted lip and a black patch over his
eye enter or leave the premises the
officer had not

  alphabet returned to the directors
office and seated himself in front of mr
garsides desk

  the strip of paper had vanished from
the carpet but as alphabet went on
to question mr garside the detective
crossed his legs and detached from the
sole of his shoe the little pink slip which
had stuck to it as he walked to the
door

  he slipped the paper unobtrusively
into his pocket not attracting garsides
attention

  are you quite sure mr garside
alphabet questioned that no one but
you knew of miss vedores appointment
with you to-day to deliver the west-
water gems none of your staff -knew
of her projected visit

  the jeweler spread expressive palms
and shrugged his shoulders

  i think not but how can i tell for
certain

  alphabet looked long and searchingly
at the man he seemed to study that
peculiar hazel wedge in the mans eye
his small pointed beard his big com-


the shadow magazine

manding nose and his strong but deli-
cate and beautifully manicured hands

  why is your office darkened mr
garside  he suddenly asked

  the jeweler surveyed the oak-paneled
walls and the black velvet curtained
windows in a comprehensive gesture
then his eyes turned to the powerful
electric light above his desk

  darkened is hardly the correct term
surely mr crisp he deprecated
this room is as light as day such a
setting as i have planned here is to
make precious stones show to better ad-
vantage by electric light

  i suppose there is no chance that
the man with the black patch-and the
diamonds-departed through the win-
dow behind those curtains alphabet
questioned further

  none whatever i told you that i
locked my door the moment the firing
commenced

  well said alphabet wed better
search the premises for him

  but they found no trace of the ma-
rauder within the shop the strong
rooms or the offices

  how will this robbery affect you 
asked alphabet as he was about to take
his departure

  we are covered by insurance of
course came the answer so we shall
not suffer financially

  right said alphabet it looks to
me as if there has been a leakage of in-
formation somewhere in your staff
will you let me know when any other
particularly valuable consignment of
jewels is to be received

  mr garside shrugged his shoulders
it is a question of relative values
mr crisp we carry a stock of enor-
mous value i am surprised that the
thieves contented themselves with the
westwater diamonds

but still persisted alphabet id
like to know say if any famous stones
are likely to come into your charge
very well agreed the jeweler

  back at headquarters inspector me-
aliece was awaiting alphabet crisp

  i had your call crisp announced
the grizzled old veteran youre a
lucky dog to find yourself right on the
spot at the psychological second so to
speak

  the assistant commissioner has left
word that i was to take you to him as
soon as you got back so come along

  as they entered the assistant commis-
sioners room carleton cumberledge
pushed aside a paper he had been study-
ing and drew a fresh file toward him

  he greeted alphabet with a quick
smile youve butted right in on a big
thing this time crisp cumberledge
volunteered weve been keeping a
certain few things on the quiet for the
very good reason that we dont want to
have the papers hold an inquest on our
division for leaving a dangerous gun-
man at large

  and that in fact is just what has
been happening with this man who has
a black patch over his eye

  the assistant commissioner paused
and alphabet made a murmur of police
interest

  black patch thats the only name
we know him by cumberledge went
on bjack patch the deadliest shot
with a pistol the most ruthless killer
weve run across yet

  that man has led every daring jewel
raid in this city for the last two years
weve caught members of his gang as
they escaped at times but weve never
caught him or even seen him escaping

  has he always worn a black patch
over his eye sir interrupted alphabet

  yes replied cumberledge and con-
tinued 

  the general details of his raids are
known the papers have published par-
ticulars of how the criminals killed a
clerk in each office and literally shot
their way to liberty as they escaped in
a racing car whose number we never
got-or when we did it did us no good
the shadow magazine



  but the secret we have guarded is
this

  always the operation was directed
by a smooth-faced individual with a
hideous twisted lip and a black patch
over his right eye always black
patch himself shot down the unfortu-
nate clerks-and he shot to kill

  and always the clerk who was mur-
dered was the only employee of the firm
who could possibly have given him in-
formation as to when the big consign-
ment of diamonds or the big amount
in bonds would be on the premises

  in other words it is probable that
they were his confederates and that he
killed them to prevent a squeal what
i have been wondering about was the
man who was killed in this mornings
raid-and what we can find out about
him

  alphabets eyes were blazing and he
was almost stuttering with excitement
as he answered

  black patch made a mistake at last
ill bet there was no one killed in
to-days robbery and miss vedore
and mr garside both claim no one but
themselves knew that the westwater
diamonds were to be brought to the
shop to-day

  and too crisp finished black
patch was neither seen entering nor
leaving the premises

  no one ever has seen him make his
get-away the assistant commissioner
answered gloomily

  listen sir said alphabet whose
hand had stolen to his pocket miss
vedore states that this fellow black
patch was standing in the shadow be-
tween a big grandfather clock and the
portiere covering garsides doorway

  garside states that he locked him-
self inside his office at the sound of the
first shot but this is what i spotted on
the carpet just inside the door of gar-
sides room

  alphabet opened the hand he had
withdrawn from his pocket and dis-

closed a crumpled strip of flesh-colored
but transparent adhesive plaster

  carleton cumberledge frowned at the
object for a long moment and inspector
mcaliece by means of a discreet depre-
catory cough expressed his opinion that
his subordinate had blundered very
badly

  well queried the assistant com-
missioner

  you dont see the implication sir
responded alphabet

  i do not

  alphabet heaved a small sigh as he
tucked the tiny strip of plaster away
carefully in his pocket book

  in that case id like to be a little
more certain of my suspicions before i
put forward a theory sir he stated

  the frown disappeared from the as-
sistant commissioners forehead and a
quick smile moved his lips

  youre a queer secretive guy
crisp he laughed but ill give you
a free hand for the next forty-eight
hours since youve a theory in prospect
and some suspicions to work upon for
ill be hanged if any officer connected
with the black patch cases has produced
even that much up to the present

  alphabet crisp left headquarters
and went directly toward the same club
which had been his goal earlier that
day

  this time he arrived at his destina-
tion and found patsy there entirely un-
occupied

  patsy alphabet began im on the
verge of tremendous things and none
other than you can be of mighty help
now listen and see what you can do
for me

  can you out of the wealth of clients
you use for a living find one extremely
sporting wealthy person who is willing
to take a chance for the benefit of the
public

  can you or can you not introduce
me to some such person and use your


the shadow magazine

influence to have them follow my sug-
gestions 

  can you patsy countered with
equal force though not such enthusi-
astic spirit spare some time for a bite
to eat and explain further your great
desires

  so they did and after the brief meal
patsy and alphabet found their way to
the home of one of the wealthiest of
the younger sportsmen marvin chan-
dler

  and he proved a sportsman through
and through so alphabet went to bed
that night in perfect peace

  throughout the following morning
alphabet waited in his office for a tele-
phone call that never came through
soon after noon he walked along the cor-
ridor and knocked at the door of the
assistant commissioners office

  well crisp any fresh develop-
ments queried cumberledge

  there will be developments this
afternoon sir unless ive missed the
mark altogether alphabet temporized

  hm-m-m have any special arrange-
ments to be made

  rather a lot im afraid sir may
i suggest that police reserves be called
up for forty-eighth and forty-ninth
streets and that the flying squad be
ready to deal with a racing car carrying
armed passengers

  and-if you dont mind sir-id
like a couple of large busses to block
fifth avenue either side of hammer-
sons at precisely two minutes after four
oclock this afternoon i have a hunch
those premises are going to be raided
again

  youre a mysterious devil crisp as
i think ive remarked before but i sup-
pose you know what youre up to
smiled the officer and taking up the
telephone issued the necessary instruc-
tions

  before he left headquarters alphabet
spent a few minutes with inspector me-
aliece explaining his scheme

  at a few minutes before four oclock
that afternoon alphabet entered the
premises of the hammerson jewelers
and asked for the managing director

  he found mr garside seated in his
office with heavy black velvet curtains
drawn and shutting out every scrap of
daylight from the window which ap-
peared to be open since the curtains
stirred slightly from time to time a
single electric light blazed brilliantly
above the desk

  the jewelers bearded countenance
broke up into beaming smiles at the
sight of the visitor

  why mr crisp he cried this is
most opportune i have been upon the
point of telephoning to you ever since
i opened my mail this morning mr
marvin chandler may be here at any
moment he is coming to consult me
concerning some of his jewel collec-
tions

  you are afraid of a repetition of
yesterdays raid eh  queried alphabet
as he seated himself at the opposite side
of the desk i wonder why you did
not call me up as you promised 

  but before garside could answer
there was a shout from the shop and a
shot rang out well though alphabet
had schooled himself the sudden com-
motion caused him to turn toward the
door in the same instant there was a
terrific report close at hand and out
went the light

  instantly alphabet spun round and
his hands dropped like steel clamps upon
the hands of garside and although
those hands held no weapon and gar-
side urged him to secure the man who
must have entered by the window and
remained concealed behind the curtains
alphabet still held on until the door
into the shop opened and mcaliece ap-
peared

  at the same instant the light flood-
ing into the room from the open door
was augmented by the curtains mask-
ing the window being softly separated
the shadow magazine



the slightly vacuous features of patsy
piers peered through the opening

  theres your man officer theres
the fellow who shot out the light get
him shouted garside excitedly and
strove to tear his wrists from alpha-
bets restraining grasp

  me shot out the light oh no
absolutely not nothing in my pockets
except a pair of good fists i assure you
pretty useful with them when necessary
of course therefore no need for silly
messy firearms oh no absolutely and
most emphatically not that from
patsy

  what are you doing here  queried
inspector mcaliece sternly

  me oh just passing along saw
the open window heard old alphabets
voice and dropped in to see how he was
keeping his end up letting a little
light into dark places eh

  patsy waved an explanatory hand
from the extinguished light to the now
open velvet curtains there were only
two people in this room and one of them
was the man who fired a shot he
added

  with a dour smile on his grim fea-
tures inspector mcaliece stepped for-
ward and snapped steel handcuffs upon
the supple wrists of josiah garside
after which alphabet relieved the man
of the pistol which reposed in his coat
pocket and with a quick gesture
snatched the false beard from his chin

  from another pocket he fished up a
black eye shade and a roll of flesh-col-
ored transparent adhesive plaster

  voila mr black patch he an-
nounced

  aye agreed the inspector and
whats more weve got the rest of the
gang-all except two who were killed
when that racing car charged one of
your busses head on that was a bright
idea crisp

  by the way the inspector went on
i guess chandler is waiting in the shop
to tell you how much hes enjoyed the

entertainment and hes holding on
pretty tight to his jewels i guess

  later that evening alphabet crisp
again confronted the assistant commis-
sioner

  now then crisp lets have the
story said cumberledge ive dealt
with the hammerson jewelers for some
time past and garside is the last man
i should have suspected of being black
patch im eager to hear how you spot-
ted him

  well of course sir said alphabet
diffidently it was just dumb luck my
being on the spot when miss vedores
diamonds were stolen you see i was
in the room when she revived from her
fainting fit and her very first words
focused my attention upon the main
issue

  she stated that a horrible-looking
man with a twisted lip and a black
patch over his right eye fired a pistol
at her and that other armed men en-
tered the premises and that her jewel
case was snatched from her in the ensu-
ing confusion

  the point that struck me at once
was that the man with the black patch
must have been actually on the premises
before the raid began but none of the
assistants nor the doorman had seen this
man enter the premises they had not
seen him in the shop nor was he to he
found when we searched for him

  it seemed possible therefore that
he might be nothing more than a fig-
ment of miss vedores imagination if
on the other hand such a person had
been present the only place in which he
could possibly have taken refuge was
the managing directors office

  but garside stated that he had
locked his door directly the firing
started and moreover that door had
only just fceen opened when i entered
the shop

  it was during the ensuing conversa-
tion that i spotted a small strip of ad-


the shadow magazine

hesive plaster upon the carpet inside the
room it was flesh-colored and trans-
parent and it suggested to me the pos-
sibility that the use of such a strip of
plaster might enable a man to fake the
appearance of a twisted lip which will
go a long way toward providing an effi-
cient disguise

  the black patch might be an ad-
junct to the miscreants make-up but
that matter provided an open issue un-
til i returned here and you sir told
me about the previous exploits of black
patch

  from your statement sir it appeared
that the leader of the gang had been
wearing the black patch for a period of
at least two years

  now the use of an eye shade sug-
gested either a diseased or injured eye
which had to be protected or that the
eye was missing or had some distinc-
tive characteristic which the owner
wished to conceal

  the wearing of the shade for two
years seemed to me to preclude the pos-
sibility of disease or injury and so i
decided i must look either for a one-
eyed man or a person with a peculiar
right eye

  garside had a distinctive hazel wedge
in the gray iris of his right eye and it
seemed reasonable to assume that black
patch had disappeared into garsides
office when the westwater diamonds
were stolen the presence of a strip
of plaster inside the door served to
strengthen this theory

  then sir you told me of the shoot-
ing of possible confederates by black
patch upon the occasion of previous
raids but if garside was black
patch he would need no accomplice to

tell him when the westwater diamonds
would be delivered to the hammerson
jewelers it was then that i said that
blade patch had blundered

  with this theory forming in my
mind i determined to lay a trap and
through the instrumentality of my
friend patsy piers i induced mr
chandler to make an appointment to
deliver some of his jewels to garside
at four oclock this afternoon

  ah this morning i waited for gar-
side to put through the promised call
notifying me that further famous jewels
were likely to come into his custody no
call came through and meanwhile you
know of the steps that were taken to
deal with the raid if it should take place

  as patsy had helped me and was
anxious to have a hand in the affair i
asked him to watch the window open-
ing from garsides office onto a deserted
side street

  i have no doubt that garside real-
ized that i suspected him and it was
for that reason that he shattered the
lights with a pistol shot while i was in
his room at the time of chandlers ar-
rival which coincided with the appear-
ance in the shop of black patchs gang
of gunmen

  no doubt garside intended to finish
me off in the darkness and for that
reason had left open the window by
which piers entered in order that it
might appear as if black patch had ar-
rived and left by that window

  as you know sir we found a black
patch and a roll of plaster in garsides
pocket his beard was a false one and
miss vedores jewel case was locked
away in his safe i-think that that ex-
plains the whole matter

ho copper ever faced a sterner test than
did terry lanahan in

devils dungeons

by bill

 bow kee waited by the window of
his top-floor back-room home in the
dim half light of a fluttering gas jet
whisps of smoke climbed ceilingward
from the joss sticks burning before a
grinning brass idol

  it was quiet there in the yards and
alleys back of mott street and old bow
kee with his face half turned to the
open window peered down through nar-
rowed slanting eyelids to the black
shadows where the man would come to
crouch and watch

  to the old chinaman the centuries
were passing while he searched the dark

cook

cavernous depths for detective terry
lanahan in the withered wrinkled
face of the oriental there was fleeting
eagerness and fear an unbelief that
this soldier of the law would come to
grapple with the wily slinking killer
whom headquarters knew as charley
king

  motionless breathing silently old
bow kee watched the shadows lana-
han of the law would need cat eyes
and the courage of the lion to break
through the watchful ranks of the yel-
low guarding hordes

  still bow kees eyes were prying


the show magazine

 soon the grim jaw-bringer would be due
 there in the darkness even now who
 knows but terry lanahan is crawling
 through one of those winding under-
 ground paths with which the chinese
 quarter is honeycombed

           

    on the streets of chinatown the yel-
  low men were standing in the doorways
 sitting on the steps that led from shops
 overstocked with silks and satins teak-
 wood novelties and sweet and pungent
 smelling foodstuffs

    faces peered from the shadows of the
 hallways cellar stairs small almond-
 eyed creatures clung to rusting fire
 escapes above the sidewalks  dusty
 lights in the better shops winked on and
 off canned music blared out from the
 restaurants-oriental tuxedo chinese
 delmonicos eastern and the glittering
 port arthur

    through the cluttered street turning
 into pell from bayard detective terry
 lanahan picked his way keeping to the
 middle of the road until he neared the
 corner where doyer street turned off
 to the right making a y with pell
 close by the clattering center that was
 chatham square

   lanahan knew his chinatown al-
 most aimlessly he sauntered to the side-
 walk here and hesitated stopped be-
 fore the gaudy window of the china
 trading house

   a broad-faced squat chinaman
 leaned in the doorway of the place
 smoking a thin cigarette and watching
 the window of a second-story flat across
 the street where a figure passed and re-
 passed lanahan saw it reflected in the
 window where he stood saw the fat
 chinks squinting lids almost close

   maybe something here afoot too
 but lanahan had his own job

   he watched the chinaman furtively
 from the corner of his eye feigned in-
 terest in the window display kept a
 sharp lookout for figures behind and
 steadily methodically lanahan edged

toward the dark cellarway that opened
beside him

  two policemen sauntered past behind
him sticks swinging short eyes alive to
the scene around them he knew they
saw him too but there was no sign of
recognition for lanahan was on a trail
that bristled with the threat of death
to the man who probed the secrets of
the teeming quarter

  here he goes said lanahan to him-
self as he saw the fat chinaman spit a
tiny cigarette butt from his lips

  with never a glance at the curious
white man at his window the portly yel-
low merchant turned and slithered away
into the dark recess at the back of his
shop

  as the chinaman turned his back
terry lanahan melted out of sight like
a puff of smoke in an instant he was
below the street level feeling swiftly
for the latch on the solid door at the
foot of the steps a quick silent shove
and he was inside closing the door be-
hind him

  whew said the detective to the
darkness around him that heathen
gets his moneys worth out of a smoke

  a brief sweep with his flashlight
showed lanahan that the il-smelling
tunnel was empty there were barrels
and piles of wilted matting tea chests
standing along the wall anything
might lurk behind these but lanahan
walked straight into the darkness grip-
ping a dependable black revolver in one
hand

  the light from his flash whipped on
and off as he groped his way to the end
of the tunnel

  here he opened a similar door and
climbed warily out into what might have
passed for a yard it was a long nar-
row irregularly shaped alley standing
close to the fence he looked over

  even in the gloom of chinatowns
night he could make out the network
of fences small sheds storehouses and
clothes poles all about him as he
the shadow magazine



moved slowly forward he could see the
lighted streaked windows of the tene-
ments ahead of him were the rabbit
warrens that faced on mott street

  counting the buildings against the
eerie glow of the sky the detective
nodded his head grimly in that top-
floor window he saw bow kee

  bow kee might have been an idol
stii and silent motionless the pale
sputtering gaslight behind him made
him appear like an overexposed snap-
shot print no detail nothing but the
head and shoulders fastened together
with a falling queue

  lanahan scaled the first fence and
dropped quietly to the littered narrow
yard a few steps across its dark width
in the deep shadow of the fence and the
detective halted he was now fairly
beneath the window where old bow kee
sat framed-waiting

  look old china boy said terry
lanahan in a voice that he would bet
couldnt be heard more than six inches
away the signal bow kee

  his flashlight was in his hand it
was tilted upward on an angle to hit the
window where the solitary figure sat
three times it flashed three swift
gleams like the breathing of a firefly

  while the detective waited now he
saw bow kees hand raised slowly to
his chin saw it slide gropingly down-
ward along the thin scrawny neck then
it was gone-and the lone headquarters
man knew that old bow kee would
never move again until the footsteps of
a murderer had passed his hall door

  lanahan crouched deeper into the
fence shadows somewhere in that maze
of burning punk of silken curtains
drawn blinds and sputtering lights a
chinaman played on a squeaky one-
string fiddle far down the block
muted by a thousand ghostly shapes
hung from pulley lines some one struck
a mournful note on a gong

  in that labyrinth of hell a shadow
covered even then charley king and

detective terry lanahan was there to

get him

  hours dragged interminably with
lanahan cramped in his fence comer
his eyes riveted on the still figure above
in the window bow kee never moved
he might have been a corpse a cadaver
propped  gainst a window frame

  doubt crept into lanahans mind as
he watched the old chink might be
double-crossing him even then it was
hard to understand the oriental slant on
murder lanahan thought

  but there was little frail bow sum
to help him in his killer quest

  bow sum was old bow kees daugh-
ter pale yellowed ivory smooth as
satin with eyes as black as the teak-
woods heart lashes and brows as sharp
and clear as master strokes from an
etchers stylus and bow sum with
lips as crimson as the poppys petals
was dead

  lanahan had found her with a dev-
ils brand in her bosom a flower from
the heavens cut down in its blooming

  white or yellow it was all the same
to detective terry lanahan it was
murder and the man who did it was
charley king

  for lanahan had found her in the
shop where king ran a fan-tan game
and was educating his young chinese-
american friends to buck the bankers
game with dice faro and the wheel

  a slick article this king with his
hair cut as trim as a well street
brokers and dressed in the height of
occidental fashion

  for a long time the cops had been
trying to get the goods on charley king
it was known that he was peddling the
stuff--opium-to the youths who
patronized his place

  when lanahan had crashed the joint
he found the hidden pipe room and it
was there that little bow sums body
lay in a red-stained bunk

  now lanahan was waiting waiting


the shadow magazine

for old bow kee to keep his promise
it was all arranged

  in front of bow kees rooms was the
apartment of charley king the old
chinamans door was partly open now
so that when king came tiptoeing back
to his rooms the aged cantonese could
pass the signal to the detective in the
shadows far below

  this wts lanahans desperate effort
two days of search of prowling the
haunts of the chinese underworld had
failed to turn up charley king

  they ajl look alike declared terry
lanahan and theyre as silent as mum-
mies just cover you with their shut-
tling beady eyes

  no telling who was watching lanahan
as he crouched there in the dark a
dozen slanting eyes might even then be
covering him

  it was a dangerous job but the de-
tective kept a picture before him of the
vice den he had found and the wilted
lily of the east-a broken blossom

  near midnight and the garbfed mys-
tic noises of the western orient around
him the odors of fried cooking and the
perfume of the punks wearied lana-
han he felt the strain at the back of
his neck then suddenly he became
rigid

 bow kee moved old bow kee
whose memory could draw the curtain
on the pageantry of the land where his
ancestors fought the dragon had moved
his head bowed it

  lanahan saw him nod the signal

  then as if he was tired of the long
vigil tired of living without his little
flower of the bubbling spring the old
chinamans head drew back again
stiffly strangely to lean against the
window sash

  leaping swiftly terry lanahan
cleared the fence and darted toward the
black hole that was a cellar door

  it was but the work of a moment to
plunge headlong into the murky dun-

geon akmg a passage passing doors
where he heard the high-low sounds of
chinese tongues and then lanahan was
running soft-footed up stair after stair

  the top floor here he halted in the
half light bow kees door was partly
open this was right but the faint
flickering glow of the gaslight showed
bow kee sitting strangely stiff thire
at the window

  the detective looked quickly toward
the door that led to charley kings
rooms it was closed he heard no
sound

  downstairs in one of the floors he
had passed there was the cackle of some
old mans high-pitched laughter lana-
han moved soundlessly across the oil-
clothed floor to kings door where he
pressed an ear to the jam listening not
even a whisper answered him

  the old guy moved mumbled lan-
ahan to himself i saw him clear
maybe hes crossing me now they
have funny notions these chinks about
betraying one of their own people to a
white man

  retracing his steps the detective
slipped through the door into bow kees
room and whispered

  hes come bow kee  breathed
lanahan and even as he spoke he saw
the dagger sticking from between the
aged orientals shoulder blades ah-
i thought it-

  bow kee was gone without a sound
no crying out no plea for life

  lanahan saw it as plain as if he had
been there saw king slip into the room
creep upon the weary parent of bow
sum and drive the gleaming blade into
his body that accounted for the sud-
den raising of bow kees head

  but king was-where 

  running quickly to the hall lanahan
drew a skeleton key from his pocket
reached kings door and turned it in
the lock the next moment the detec-
tive was stalking into the darkness his
gun clutched in a hard hand his eyes
the shadow magazine

u

probing the gloom where street lights
made the corners of the room blacker
than a pit

  the blow that landed on the back of
the detectives head was like a gun blast
lanahan staggered his gun falling from
shocked fingers a sudden scuffling of
feet

  he heard the sound as in a dream but
instinct told him he was face to face
with charley king

 damn you you yellow- lana-
han spat the words as he sprang dazed
at the fleeing figure his weak fingers
clawed at the arm of an unseen man
there was a crash as two bodies thudded
to the floor

  white devil-- squealed the other

fighting like a demon himself you
thought-

  lanahan smashed out with his fist
holding with a desperate grasp of his
other hand the man or fiend who-
ever it wajs snarled like a beast and beat
wildly at the detective one more try
and detective terry lanahan would
have his man

  his strong arms reached and snaked
the other to him then the darkness
grew even blacker and lanahan
slumped suddenly to the floor his head
exploding in a thousand pieces

  hrs own blood drooling from his lips
choked the detective to consciousness
he pushed himself up to his knees drew
a handkerchief and wiped the crimson
stream from his face

  he felt the back of his head then
he felt around slowly for the gun he
had dropped

  the room was silent and the door
stood half open in the hall he heard
a faint sound footsteps some one
coming

  lanahan staggered to his feet and
found his flash he switched it on and
saw a joint of thick bamboo laying near
where he had fallen wrapped at the
ends it was with braided strands of

crimson silk and from its weight the
headquarters man knew it was loaded
with lead

  he threw it on the bed and edged
softly to the door a step into the hall
let him peer down through the narrow
slit of a stair well

  dim light weird just blue and black
and gray but a long clawlike hand
was sliding up the bannister he
watched it coming heard the muffled
tread of slippers on the stairs listened
to the shuffling mincing steps as the
figure walked the length of each land-
ing then it was gone

  a door below him opened softly
closed and the hall was again as silent
as before

  only the creature murmur of a build-
ing packed with life-and death the
door to bow kees room stood open
and now the gaslight waved like a flag
in the breeze lanahan watched it a
moment turned his head and looked up
toward where the stairway led to the
roof

  that door was standing ajar

  charley king had gone that way

  shaking himself to throw off the fog
that dulled his head the detective
climbed the stairs halting at the top to
listen hearing nothing but the grum-
ble of the quarter he shoved the door
open a moments wait then lanahan
was on the roof stepping around to
place his back against the wall of the
kiosk his gun nursed in twitching
fingers

  there were four roofs there of the
same height and lanahan moving
softly began the search for charley
king

  the air was thick and heavy damp
with the dew of night and reeking with
the menace of a killers unseen gun
still the detective crept bent double
crossing to the adjoining roof peering
into the airshaft testing skylights for a
trick hideout

  the scraping of a foot on painted tin


the shadow magazine

brought his head around at the sound
like a sinker he dropped below an air-
shaft coping and heard the whining
whistle of lead

   the battle was on

  lanahan edged to the corner of the
coping saw a figure leap from behind a
kiosk on the next roof and fired it
was chance shooting and his head was
still dull and hurting like the very devil
another bullet shrieked over his breast-
work

   drop it barked lanahan recklessly
as he jumped up and ran toward the
ghostlike figure drop that gun

  two shots whizzed dangerously near
him as he plunged across the wall his
own gun roared viciously as he tried to
place one shot into the shadowy flight of
king

  from one protection to another the
two raced now killer and detective
shooting savagely then came the edge
of the last roof lanahan fired hur-
riedly as he saw the chinaman slide
over the wail

   a bullet or a broken neck shouted
the detective following quickly this
is the end of charley king

  knowing the race though lanahan
grew cautious instead of the broken
 body of the killer he might face a
steadier gun moving along the roof
he peered over from another point be-
hind a chimney which served as a pro-
tection against his unseen prey

   twenty feet below was the other roof
and there was no trace of king alive
or dead the chink had made a clean
get-away

  in the darkness lanahan could only
guess he prowled along the edge of
the roof and his hand came in contact
with a heavy rope so that was it

  been used before said lanahan
feeling it now maybe-

  without waiting to finish his sum-
mary he slid over the edge took a hand-
hold on the rope and went down hand

over hand there he could see plainly
now the cover half off the hatch

  from the black depths of the building
below he could hear the high-low voices
again the sounds of chinamen talking
excitedly doors opening and closing
the slithering of slippered feet on mat-
ting or bare floors

  it was not a time to measure chances
lanahan shoved the cover aside took a
deep breath of the night air grabbed the
coping and swung himself downward
feeling with his feet it was hit or
miss and he let go

  miles and miles the detective dropped
through the darkness at last his feet
struck the edge of a sharp narrow ob-
ject something gave beneath him

  there was the thundering crash of
an overturned packing case and lana-
han his feet kicked from beneath him
went sprawling head-first against a pile
of bajes and bolts of cloth one of his
ankles burned with pain but he had no
time to bother with little things

  onjbis feet now he dragged his flash
and sent it splashing around the place
a tiny room stuffed with merchandise
of all sorts the detective stepped to
the door and yanked the knob the door
was locked

  fox and hounds he said bitterly
well youre askin for it charley
king when i come up with you
therell be blood enough to suit even
youf

  from the door lanahan shoved his
way to the window this too was
fastened inside

  inside

  then the chink did not use the fire
escape there but the detective would
he unsnapped the latch and threw the
window up crawling out on the rick-
ety platform he reached along until he
was at the window of the adjoining
room

  against the dull yellow light in the
room a savage leather-hued face ap-
shad- a
the shadow magazine



peared staring at lanahan with eyes
that smoldered glittering with the age-
old hatred of the yellow for the white

  no the chinese lips moved in
the one word and lanahan drew his
gun

  open  he shouted turning once to
glance down into the dark yard below
open up sing wo

  as he spoke the detective could make
out other faces behind sing wo other
shaven heads with queues wrapped
tightly around the poll

  the chinaman shook his head slowly
stubbornly one hand resting on the sill
the other hidden drawn up into a
voluminous black crepe sleeve

  no

  lanahans foot came up swiftly and
he drove it without further warning
through the glass pandemonium fol-
lowed as the detective reached in and
slid the latch shoved the window up
and jumped into the room

  five chinks were facing him with
sing wo in front the solid stocky
evil-looking sing wo

  i want charley king demanded
lanahan turn him in sing wo and
therell be no trouble

  the five yellow men took note of
lanahans appearance of the blood
caked on his face of the tousled hat-
less head and the dirt and grime of his
clothes

  no see cholly king said sing wo
blandly wuffo you blake winnuh
huh i callee plice you go way
talk united states sing returned
the detective dont kid with me im
in a mood to shoot my way out of
here lanahan was while he talked
reloading his revolver which way
did king go

  none of the chinamen moved an
inch they were between the headquar-
ters man and the door leading to the
hall terry lanahan had an idea where
he was the building was the headquar-
ters of several oriental societies not
shad-a

the tongs but the newer modern
groups formed in chinatown for vari-
ous purposes these chinks were bad-
looking guys and lanahan wanted to
get through without more trouble

  well he demanded out with it
sing where is he 

  no see insisted the leader of the
g oup

  al right agreed lanahan out of
the w y then ill get-

  no shouted sing wo and he was
backed up by a muttering cruel quartet
whose hands were hidden in their
sleeves a tense chill silence gripped
the room momentarily

  it was a tableau carved from dyna-
mite sing wo with slightly upraised
hand the other hidden in his sleeve
those other four stolid stiff expression-
less

  only a moment lanahan waited he
saw their scheme the wile of the gang
holding him there while king made a
get-away secreted himself some place
in that rat burrow

  well hed fool them show these saf-
fron-colored wolves what kind of fighter
headquarters sent after killers in china-
town

  his gun came up with a flash and
coughed harshly once sing wo
screamed a curse as he fell against the
wall bent over a bleeding fist

  the others shrieked high-pitched
heathen voices in a cackling wild-eyed
chorus but their hands remained in
their sleeves as they leaped back away
from the smoking gun

  lanahan was at the door swinging
swiftly on a heel to face them their
sleeve-incased arms raised to shield
their faces they crouched as if to spring
on him the whole pack like animals on
a lone victim

  one move outa you said lanahan
shoving the gun toward them and
therell be a lot of picnics at the cem-
etery

	yanking at the door he jumped into


the shadow magazine

the ha and slammed the lock behind
him there he waited pressed against
the wall listening intently only grat-
ing sibilant whispers reached his strain-
ing ears

  then from below down those stairs
through the shadows he heard a sharp
staccato voice blurt a string o chinese
and the closing of a door cut it short in
the middle of a word

  lanahan started slowly creeping
down the stairs

  charley king was in that building
that was certain for the yellow mur-
derer would never hit the pavement
while the department men were waiting
outside for him to show his face there
were too many other ways of beating
the rap

  and lanahan not nearly half fought
out was going to search for those ways
that the chinaman knew

  stopping halfway down the first
flight of stairs terry lanahan sat
down he had two reasons he
wanted to collect his thoughts while
resting and he wanted to give whoever
was on that top floor an opportunity to
feel the coast was clear to open a door
and show a face

  he hadnt long to wait slippered
feet were coming toward the door at the
front of the building

  a soft whispering of a turning door
knob and a crack of light filtered out
into the hall lanahan watched it nar-
rowly soon a shining dome appeared
and a thin emaciated-looking face
peered out

  lanahan sat rigid and saw the flap-
ping blouse and trousers come into view
the head was tilted over the stair rail

  stand still said the detective his
gun was pointed directly between the
chinamans eyes dont holler

  no seeexplained the chink readily
me no see

  who asked terry lanahan stalk-
ing carefully upward who asked you

anything come on walk ahead
there

  following the thin yellow man into
the room the detective stopped inside
the door before him sat three ori-
entals of various ages and weights

  they were grouped around a table in
the center of which was a wide shallow
bowl all three of them were picking
bits of meat and sticky gobs of rice
from this with the aid of chopsticks
and their fingers

  you no see said lanahan to his
guide nobody see

  no see chorused the four promptly
alle timee havee chop

  no funny business now cautioned
the detective stay in your coop and
play safe

  after looking into a closet and un-
der a covered couch lanahan backed
out into the hall spinning swiftly to
cover his exit and the hall that ran the
length of the building

  more doors below him closed again
softly and once again he was probably
alone in the tenement hall

  one step at a time he eased himself
down feeling the treads carefully for a
squeak now and then skipping one al-
together

  one thing was positive he was get-
ting nearer to charley king

  out of the gloom beneath him there
suddenly came the guttural sound of two
men talking lanahan could not un-
derstand what was said-it was chinese
-but somebody was giving orders that
was plain from the tone of one and the
answers of the other

  soon while the detective watched be-
tween the banister and railing a
strange thing took place two floors be-
low that was the ground floor juiit
a few steps above street level

  shadows fell in the hall now and the
shuffling sound of many slippered feet
the short terse voice of a headman
counting came up men were coming
from the front room of the building
the shadow magazine



marching- in a line one behind the other
along the hall toward the rear

  not coming lack-nor was there a
door closed after lanahan had counted
twenty of them and seen their shadows
pass

  twenty chinks said the detective
in an undertone something is on the
fire maybe a guard for charley king

  careftlly now with his gun in his
fist lanahan crept down the stairs at
the ground floor he could peek through
the paper-covered glass door across
the street he could see one of his mates
standing a little to the east of a line
that centered on his building

  the underground nodded lanahan
grimly downstairs in those snake
pits

  there was only one way for that
crowd of yellow men to go and lana-
han turned toward the back of the hall
downstairs it meant the last stand if
king was hiding there possibly pro-
tected by a band of his yellow com-
panions

  outside the street was covered by
the dicks and harness bulls that went
for the street behind and though the
chances were slim that a white cop
could run a chinese murderer down in
the maze of underground passages be-
low that entire quarter there was only
one thing for terry lanahan to do

  at the back of the hall he found the
door leading to the basement down he
went to slip quickly to the rear again
and locate the last door it was locked
on the other side

  terry moved his gun up close to the
lock and gave it the works-two quick
shots smashing the silence the thick
hot stillness of the hall and sending the
lock in a dozen directions

  gun or no gun it was like a mouse
hopping into a den of rattlers no copper
ever faced a sterner test no wielder of
a law gun ever matched his courage
against slimmer chance for his life

  but terry lanahan did not even

pause he jerked the door open with
his hand thrust through the blasted 
opening

  and in another moment he was at
the bottom of the stairs studying the
silent faces of more chinamen than he
had ever seen in one place

  at either end of the narrow dungeon
they were grouped and another gang
of seven blocked a crude arched door
that was chiseled from the foundation
midway under the building

  it was too late to back out if he had
wanted to

  a mans life was not worth a burned
match unless lanahan stood where
he was or planted himself with his back
to one of the two walls he had china-
men behind him it must be a quick
decision

  whos running this party de-
manded the detective gazing about at
the faces most of which looked alike

  who wants to know asked a
smooth voice and one of the chinks
at the archway took a half step toward
the headquarters man

  john law china boy said lana-
han holding himself in check this
rat trap is ready to dip in oil a hun-
dred guns are picketed around this
building and i want charley king for
murder

  and what will happen if we tell you
we have not seen him 

  the suave confident leering manner
of the chinese burned the detective hot
with rage he knew his limitations
here what a chance he faced with his
life nevertheless he was going
through	-

  nothing said lanahanv adding
quickly only ill go through that way
pointing to the arch where the seven
stood and ill take a look-see for my-
self

  this is not a thoroughfare argued 
the chinaman charley king did not
come through here


the shadow magazine

  well im going in there declared
the detective he noticed could feel
the movement in the dungeon knew the
chinks were closing in on him his gun
came up wavering and he drew the
trigger back cocking it with bis thumb

  ill take six for one he said mean-
ingly six for one are you going
places or do i start shooting

  we are society men said a short
slim yellow man we are pledged to
our symbol and are not afraid to die
what right have you here  this is our
place

  detective terry lanahan drew a
tight steady bead on the speakers head
boring the gun muzzle dead center be-
tween the eyes

  how many stealthy black muzzles
were pointed at him he could not tell
would never know but he had enough
of the irish-american fighting spirit
the dare-devil recklessness bred of child-
hood in the fourth ward to pit him-
self against a hundred yellow hellions

  he had to die he knew that then
and there there was no way out of it
now a copper never surrenders to the
criminal whatever be the odds so it
was shoot it out

  how many could he get if he was
lucky in the shambles that the first
shot would precipitate he might get five
of them but the pieces they would
leave that belonged to terry lanahan
would be hard to patch together what
a fadeout for a first-class detective

  they saw his indecision he could
read it in their faces they were look-
ing for him to turn and crawl scared
and beaten out and up the stairs to
safety well hed fool them

  im countin china boy he said
biting off the words like chips of chilled
steel ill count to three if your
guys are still blocking that door when
i call the number-you die first make
your choice-and-any nervous gun in
this hole will get you killed before your
time get me 

  there was a low murmur at this and
the spokesman for the chinamen nar-
rowed his slanting eyes his lips
moved but no word was spoken

  one called lanahan clearly his
tone echoing through the musty tomb-
like passage

  a few heads moved as they saw his
fearless concentration on the target head
before him he felt the movement let
his eyes waver for an instant watching
for a weakening still the seven blocked
the arch

  two shouted lanahan like an
auctioneer he seemed to feel selling his
life to the highest bidder he felt the
blood beating at his temples watched
his gun hand saw it sticking out there
as solid as an iron girder

  thoughts of home of the bunch
down in the bureau room at headquar-
ters a good bunch those boys it
was tough that he could never see them
again

  his lips moved now and the third
number the fatal three was form-
i ng

  wait said the chinese spokesman
not a man had moved an instant
more and guns would have hurled wan-
ton death to right and left lanahans
hand remained steady

  beads of golden icy sweat stood on
the chinamans brow maybe he was
not afraid but he didnt want to kick
off on the hard end of a detectives
bullet

  the ghost hand of his ancestors was
tapping him on the shoulder they had
cunning they were crafty and their an-
cient ways were favored of confucius

  an older wiser man wouldhave
sneered-ip- utter scorfi as this chinky
gunman risked the snarling displeasure
of the great ancestral god

  you can search he said finally
holding up his hand we dont want
bloodshed here policeman one thing
is all i ask
the shadow magazine



  what

   let our council walk out of here
 he answered they are in the secret
 chamber he pointed back of him
 through the arch they are old men
 and they dont approve of gun battles
 with the law

   lanahan stepped closer to the yellow
 speaker he smelled a rat as they
 say in the underworld but he saw the
 one chance for victory just one chance

   what this chink wanted was to cover
 the get-away of charley king  lana-
 han knew that passage and knew it had
 but one safe exit it emptied out into
 pell street where a fixed post would
 stop a scramble of chinamen as quickly
 as chalk figures are wiped from a slate

   all the dens that opened off this
 passage was another thing no one
 man could know them all but this was
 part of the chance lanahan had to
 take

   you dont want to bring the bulls
 down on you he said i know youre
 looking for a break for yourself yel-
 low well ill tell you what well
 let your council march out of here-

  one at a time-but-how many of
 them 

   five-in all answered the vicious-
 looking chink

   o k said the detective they
 come out-but--this pack of dogs goes
 out first up they go all but two
 two can stay to see that i keep my
 word

   then with a sudden lunge terry
 lanahan had the spokesman by the
 wrist and with a quick twist held him
 close powerless the revolver rammed
 against his spine tell them shouted
 lanahan to get moving two can
 stayt

   his prisoner hesitated the gun
 jammed against his spine harder
 scratching upward to a spot between the
 shoulder blades a bullet there would
 finish a man in a breath

   speak yelled terry tell them

o k or ill split you in two like a
herring

  get going said the chinaman let
him stay with hop an me we will see
that no white devils foot crosses the
doorstep of the secret chamber

  lanahan crowded back against the
wall and saw them pass him scowling
savage faces they seemed in the half
light of the dungeon up the stairs
they shuffled some shoving the more
reluctant ones a gun or two was vis-
ible in the gloom

  soon there were but three men in the
burrow  detective lanahan and the two
chinks hop lee and the spokesman a
leader of the gang sam toy

  turning with sam toy still before
him lanahan started for the arch it
was not as light in there and the damp
ill-smelling tunnel turned some distance
away-turned to the right out of sight

  tell them the detective ordered
toy to come one at a time

  sam toy called shrilly it was an-
other voice from that in which he spoke
english to the headquarters man his
high-pitched nasal sputterings shot
through the tunnel ringing off the
stones like thrown knives

  far away back in that hidden maze
of mole paths came the answer to lana-
hans ears a sharp squealing answer
snapped off like a fire cracker that hisses
its warning explodes and vanishes

  well walk in said lanahan save
time

  there was just room for two to walk
abreast the detective motioned hop
lee to go ahead

  slowly the trio started lanahan
was thinking fast what was his next
move to be what could he expect to
find as these council members passed
unless one of them was charley king
and how could they hope to fool him

  lanahan knew charley king the
chinese gambler-gunman was a young
man smooth-faced slick and agile a


the shadow magazine

bad actor so the underworld said of
charley king

  some ones coming said lanahan
aloud to himself

  huh said sam toy

  here comes the first one answered
the lawman keeping an eye on hop
lee whose right hand he had already
noted hovered in the region of a bulging
near his heart let him pass you
feller

  there was light enough to see as
they came close to you terry lanahan
watched the face of the old man who
came by somewhat timid but the spark
was there in those oval eyes that glit-
tered like a pair of jet beads

  one by one they came and went one
two three four four was com-
ing bent and tottering an old man
lanahan felt his two guards stiffen as
the man approached

  it must be the high muckamuck chief
mandarin or something

  then terry knew that hop lee had
fallen back a step that sam toy edged
in closer tried to fall a step behind

  keep moving he ordered and as
the old man came nearer the detective
lagged hop lee and sam toy were
in front of him now so was the old
councilman

  steps were between them only four
three two-lanahan bent his head to
see the withered face of a chinaman
who must have been a thousand years
old his queue was long trailing over
his shoulder and down over his folded
arms with his hands shoved into his
sleeves that was all

  the old man passed two steps and
something warned lanahan

  no you dont he cried swinging
and dodging as he did you didnt
fool me you-

 in that brief moment lanahan
ducked death three times he saw the
whirling old chinese and knew his
guess was right it was king-killer
king-with a masters make-up on his

face and garbed in the costume of his
forefathers

  from his sleeve king had drawn the
knife he had hoped to drive into lana-
hans breast with a wild yell he
threw it

  one gun barked with a frightful roar
then there was a crackling blast of re-
volver fire

  lanahan was on his hands and knees
in the tunnel his first bullet downed
charley king who had kicked off the
slopping satin slippers and started to
run

  a bullet from the gun of hop lee
ripped through theforearm of the de-
tective but terry lanahan had faced
gang guns before he shot sam toy
through the heart and grabbed his body
pulling it before him then he sent a
slug into the staggering charley king

  yiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeee it was hop
lees scream as he pulled his trigger
and the gun jammed

  the law gun crashed again and lee
toppled jerking spasmodically

  for a moment all was still but the
place was filled with smpke and lana-
han rose in the blue haze to search the
shadow for the murderer of bow sum
and old bow kee

  king was sliding along the wall
propped up by a pair of trembling legs
in a flash he dive-d for the floor near
lanahans feet the detective saw him
grasp the krisslike dagger snap it to his
finger tips and draw back for the
throw

  take it yelled lanahan weakly
and he let go the last bullet in his po-
lice special charley king crumpled as
would a sawdust doll

	lanahan stared at him looked
around three men were dead or dy-
ing there with him his own arm
twitched and pained as if he had been
branded with a red-hot iron and now
he feltf another wouftd and pressed his
hand to his side
the shadow magazine



  somebody had marked him up with
a wild shot or maybe it had been that
first knife trick of kings

  he was weak and bleeding freely
from two wounds he had to get out of
there yet to try and get through the
way hed come was just plain crazy

  listen somebodys coming down
those steps now soft-slippered feet and
whispering tongues the chinks

  lanahan leaned over to where sam
toy lay sprawled like a rolled carpet
a quick jerk at the chinamans blouse
and the law was armed again he broke
the gun and felt the loads in the cylin-
der

 come on charley king said
lanahan staggering to his feet i
came for you and im taking you in-
or out

  halting a second lanahan listened
keenly the sounds came nearer that
end of the tunnel those yellow fiends

  blam lanahan sent a bullet smash-
ing against the end of the tunnel then
he reached down took a vigorous grip
on charley kings wrist and jerked him
up the one-man carry old army
stuff buddy

  king was dead as jelly and lanahan
backed carefully through the murky
haze he felt the turn in the tunnel
shot a quick glance to his left then
weak and panting he raced madly for
the door at the end-and pell street

  before he reached it he saw the

brighter light a grating somewhere
he raised his gun and smashed the lock
on the door then stumbled up and tore
it open falling out with his prisoner

  panic gripped pell street where the
shabby lanahan staggered half erect
out into the night shadows of the street
with the dead chinese on his shoulder
terry saw the pair of blue coats on the
post near the comer one of them was
hurley a kid that terry knew

  johnny hey johnny shouted
detective lanahan he raised a half-
shot six-gun and fired it into the sky
then he tottered awkwardly forward
away from the cellar doorway and fell
face down in the gutter

  whistles blew and police came run-
ning plain-clothes men too rushed to
the spot there was a circle of them
grim-faced proud members of a force
that listed men like lanahan

  its terry cried johnny hurley
as he turned the detective over and
wrenched the dead chinese killer from
lanahans half-conscious grip terry
lanahan look he got that king the
killer get a wagon get an ambulance
what a guy he musta shot his way
out of there

  johnny hurley was right lanahan
had come through just as he had done
before to get another credit mark be-
side his name in the records and to
show the lawless legion that the code
of the force knows no surrender

 

billboarding crime

       advertising seems to be the force of modem activity of all
   kinds and it is now being used in an entirely different way to
   fight crime

        the people of one of our large cities were surprised recently
    when the store windows were flooded with posters advising citi-
    zens to phone the police whenever anything happened and ex-

    with police officers

nervy heitm had his nerve detective barney
brett had given his word

  in the third-degree room at the cen-
tral station his thin face full within
the blaze of the spotlights nervy
neltz sat in a straight-backed chair
neltzs chief characteristic a self-suffi-
cient ego rode high in his whole de-
meanor

  he was a most unusual crook was
nervy although he had been grilled
for hours he still maintained the ar-
rogant attitude that had been the
despair of his inquisitors

  looking upon his self-satisfied pris-
oner detective barney brett sighed if
only he could forget himself a few mo-
ments if only he could break that
shell of conceit how

 brett knew nervy he knew the
fellows reputation for steady nerves
was aware that neltz gloried in his op-
portunities to display his peculiar gift
brett guessed that neltz honestly be-
lieved that his nerve was less easily
warped than case-hardened steel
the shadow magazine



  but the detective knew a fact that
his captive had yet to learn-brains
count more than nerve or an air-tight
alibi even

  so you wont come through eh
said brett quietly

  neltz jeered-

  sometime youll find out i aint no
ordinary coot

  brett raised drooping lids

   k boys he said wearily must
be near morning run the curtains up
lets have a bit of cheerful sunlight

  the tired officers surrounding the
straight-backed chair looked at one an-
other in disappointment and at neltz
with unfeigned dislike

  detective barney brett honorable
unselfish friendly daring to a degree
was their idol each of them knew that
bretts immediate promotion depended
upon a confession from the cocksure
half-pint-size mug who lolled with su-
premely insulting composure beneath
the glaring bulbs

  one of the subordinates obediently
rolled up the shades the crisp new
fall day poured in

  brett addressed himself once more
to neltz

  im dead sure you robbed the bank
nervy and im equally certain that
you plugged the old watchman

  prove it

  the officers in the room beat back
their instincts with difficulty one and
all they respected barney bretts re-
straint but there was molly barneys
fiancee to think about

  molly managed a high-class restau-
rant close by the station and barney
spent his off-duty hours lazing about
her kitchen the blue-coated men were
very fond of the ambitious girl-and of
her superlative cooking

  also they were familiar with bretts
promise that hed earn the coveted title
inspector before he married made
in jest it had through innumerable

jokes become vital barney was like
that but molly-already she had
waited too long

  and here in their power taunting
them flouting their authority bur-
lesqued the miserable little runt who
could give barney his lift and at the
same time make molly a bride col-
lectively the group ground their teeth
and puzzled with brett how could
nervy be broken to talk

  a husky barrel-chested patrolman
made an impassioned plea

  aw barney just once let me
maul the blown-up smelly amoeba ill
make him talk to you

  thanks old man returned bar-
ney but youre new on the force
that stunt never works with nervy
neltz snorted contemptuously
youre a hot bunch o dicks he
gibed

  detective brett ignored the inter-
ruption he continued patiently

  nervy is well known to us he
spoke hes laughed in his sleeve-
yes hes thumbed his nose at us for
months we strongly suspicion that hes
busted several banks we are con-
vinced that hes killed two men and
now as you know we believe he cracked
the farmers trust and shot the guard
night before last

  but you cant prove a thing twitted
nervy in scorn

  we cant prove it-now echoed
barney and we cant break the rat
down-yet

  nervy gurgled a rasping egotistical
yap

  ive told you stupid scholar lisped
the thin-faced youth with insolence that
stung and roiled how many times
when you get nervy neltz scared so
bad his hand shakes-then detective
barney brett come around for then
-and not till then-and maybe not
then-

  nervy stretched out a slender arm


the shadow magazine

his motion was deliberate designed to
irritate straight from the shoulder
and parallel with the floor lie extended
it not a-muscle twitched no slight-
est tremor rippled over any part of its
length

  nervy caught the sneaking admira-
tion in the big rookies eyes it was
like rain on his parched vanity manna
to his applause-starved soul

  for good measure nevy spread his
fingers wide the human eye could
discern- no tiniest twitch nor movement
todisturb the rocklike immobility of
arm or fingers he held the pose a
long moment-then dropped his hand
with a triumphant hoot

  humph scoffed nervy lay you
fifty to one there aint a bull in the
room can do it and dont forget im
the bird thats just side-showed you the
all-night third

  you brett-when you catch a
quiver in that hand of mine-why
maybe you might catch-cold

   from a well-concealed vantage point
a heavy voice erupted into the third-
degree room

   sorry brett intoned the deep bass
that every headquarters man knew to be
issuing from the hidden lips of lieuten-
ant andrews i hoped to send that
recommendation to the commissioner
this morning better let nervy loose i

  detective barney brett bowed his
head behind his unhappy eyes his
mind distinguished molly and her bit-
ter disappointment

  oh shed be game he could hear
her now well barney youre a cop
aint you dja ever know a cop to get
a break

  but it would be hard for her ex-
cept that hed passed his word hed go
and carry her off at once he knew
shed waited long enough was conscious
i that theyd both waited too long

  his word

   for mollys sake perhaps hed better

                                              f

ignore his promise certainly no one
would censure him his brothers in the
law would surely rejoice that he had
conquered what they termed damn fool
donkeyishness and molly-probably
shed be in ecstasies

  but what about his responsibility to
his own conscience would he for-
ever after point a secret finger of scorn
toward his own unstable heart during
all his days must he remember that hed
made a positive declaration-and then
lacked stomach and character to cleave
to the unmistakable line hed indicated
for himself 

  brett shook his head drearily he
was made as he was made at ny cost
he must pursue his light as he saw it
shame suffused his cheeks for his mo-
mentary weakness

  as though to reward him for his
strength in the face of grave tempta-
tion a forgotten thought seared across
his brain

  lieutenant cried barney brett
eagerly the two witnesses what
about them  did you break their state-
ments

  sorry barney regretted the deep
hidden voice both stick to their story
they swear nervy neltz played stud
poker with them all through night be-
fore last

  so that settled it nothing to do
now but let the vainglorious puppy go
-and hope to get him again under more
favorable circumstances to the law

  but what a travesty upon the vaunted
efficiency of justice here was a cur a
gutter rat a crawling menace to the
streets of any city without doubt a
wrongdoer-yet because the courts in-
sisted upon proof of crime nervy neltz
must be spewed back to his undercover
haunts to follow his nefarious-desires

  barney harassed his tired brain to
the phantom clamor of mollys voice
and the urgings of his own ambition
now decency arose to add her insistent
cry that nervy neltz criminal be con-
the shadow magazine



fined against his insidious projects to-
ward society

  there was a way he must find it
this scum should not again be flushed
from the police doorway onto a public
trustful in the efficacy of its public
servants how could neltz be made to
talk

  what a stinking school of jellyfish
goaded nervy he lounged erect one
of you guys get my coat see maybe
i could make you sweat for this brett
trying to intimidate a private citizen
his words mocked his very mien was
a high offense

  abruptly barney brett whirled a
sudden strange elation lit up his worn
face nervys words had struck a spark
on the flint of his mind his brain had
clicked his idea was far-fetched-
but it was worth a serious try espe-
cially with a bold show

  shove him down again boys ex-
claimed barney sharply watch him
close ill be right back

  he swung on the amazed crook so
your nerves are steady eh neltz you
got it now-your chance youre go-
ing to gamble your life on your nerves
and youre going to lose because i
know your nerves are shot

  the undersized mug opened his eyes
wide but his self-assurance was
strong he laughed loudly then he
yelled defiance after brett

  yeah bragged neltz and then
again louder to bolster his courage
oh-yeah

  half a dozen pairs of big hands joy-
fully thumped him back into the
straight-backed chair

  there was a prickly silence in the
third-degree room during the time that
detective barney brett was absent
hopeful officer looked at hopeful of-
ricer they all looked at neltz a shade
worried by bretts certainty

  what did brett scheme he seemed
sure enough as he rushed out would

his plan break the vain little crook
how was he going to do it 

  the suspense was short-lived with-
out warning brett stepped back through
the door on his arm rested a waiters
tray the tray was covered by a snowy
napkin which carried the distinguish-
ing mark of mollys restaurant

  brett kicked a chair close to nervys
knees he sat down he permitted
himself a generous smile with a flour-
ish he whisked away the napkin

  there before the astonished eyes of
nervy neltz and the no less dum
founded gaze of the group of officers
jiggled two sparkling mounds of dark-
purple jelly each mound turned out
neatly on a white saucer

  barney took up the dish nearest him
he indicated that nervy was to take
the other when neltz had lifted the
second dish brett placed the tray on
the floor near his shoe

  now-watch me nervy he cried

  the detective extended his arm his
hand stiffened to immobility the whole
arm grew rigid became stone-still

  look commanded barney look
sharp

  nervy stared in awe the policemen
drew their breaths softly as if fearful
that that gentle act even might destroy
the stability of the little mound of jelly
resting on his arm

  brett grinned after a moment he
relaxed gradually leaning over he re-
placed the saucer on the tray

  your turn nervy exulted barney
brett with avid anticipation and re-
member-if it quivers i catch a cow-
ardly little murderer you rookie
you wanted to work on neltz-stand
by

  i can do it-if you can gulped
nervy

  his voice had lost a portion of its
braggart timbre he had noted that
even as his saucer rested quietly on his
motionless knee the dark-purple jelly
mound quivered like palsied flesh


the shadow magazine

  laggardly neltz elevated his dish
and shoved out his arm desperately
he strove to harden his muscles his
arm appeared inflexible as iron yet
the jelly moved

  in swift panic neltz ground his teeth
water beads popped out on his low
forehead his jaw muscles clamped

  but his efforts were futile despite
his frantic attempts the jelly mound
shook and wiggled and joggled and
flopped to and fro

  had the cops got him at last  where
were his boasted nerves even the de-
spised dick had held the damned jelly
still

  the eyes of the thin-faced undersized
crook showed fear they began furi-
ous dartings the mans cheeks lost
color his lips whitened still he
strained in agony to steady that trem-
ulous bulk of shivering quavering jelly

  and then-detective barney brett
let out a great heart-electrifying shout

  rookie now go to work hes
lost his nerve  make that guy talk
kill him

  eagerly the barrel-chested patrolman
jumped forward with one sweep of
his bear paw he knocked the saucer
half across the room his other ham-

like fist clutched neltz by the scruff
of the neck in another instant nervy
would have been well on his way to a
good working over

  but that instant did not arrive brett
saw the crook weaken saw the horror
in his face at the sight of the burly
eager copper

  quaking in abjfect terror neltz
screamed dont oh dont let him
touch me ill talk ill talk

  barney brett let down jauntily he
waved off the disappointed patrolman
his lips curved broadly up

  did you hear lieutenant  he called
toward the wall

  you bet

  neltzs nerve was a poor counter-
feit for the real thing chief but so
was the jelly i held you see a while
ago molly boiled one batch too long it
hardened tougher than leather

  the lieutenants deep voice came
jubilantly

  great work-inspector he cried
and now i suppose youll want a
weeks vacation

  sure will agreed brett heartily
but when molly hears shell probably
insist that we spend six days of it mak-
ing jelly

millions transported

        streets hlled with money that expression was a reality re-
    cently in new york city when the united states assay office in
    wall street moved its resources to the new building in south
    street

        over a billion dollars in gold and a hundred thousand dollars
    in silver were transported from one place to the other several
    weeks were allowed for the transfer of the money-at the rate of
    about a million dollars every four minutes during working hours
    a dozen armored trucks were used for the work

        the entire operation was carried out without any hitch and
    with no trouble from any source preparations were complete
    enough to block any attempt upon the money

the third degree

a department in which oar readers face a test
of brains skill and common sense

   despite crime waves and everything else there are dull days even in
the detective business it is on such days that the men on the force gather
around the checkerboard or card table and swap tales then when stories
grow thin and time is still heavy they take a turn at testing their wits

   one detective will describe a crime or a case purposely making clews
slim or else misleading it is up to the other men on the squad to work
fast and furnish a solution

   here is such a rainy-day problem read it as it is given and seexhow
quickly you can find the reason why it can readily be summed up as an
inside job remember the whole thing is made purposely tricky youre
supposed to be a detective-go at it

            andrews bergen caldwell and dietrich were enjoying a quiet
        game of cards at the latters home they were in a small room
        upstairs seated around a table there was quite a bit of money
        present suddenly the door behind bergens back opened and the
        players were commanded to stick up their hands frozen in their
        places not one of them dared make a move with orie gun pressing
        into bergens back the other gun covering the remaining players the
        robber made all face against the opposite wall while he rifled pockets
        and took whatever money was on the table his victims still in
        their positions the thief stepped out the door and made his get-away

            in reporting the case to the police all four men furnished de-
        scriptions that were practically identical although the descrip-
        tions given were good it would have been next to impossible to
        apprehend the criminal--except for a clever detective who reasoned
        out the possibilities of an finside job and worked from that angle
        to solve the case

   are you as clever as the detective was was it an inside job if it
was had he sufficient reason to act upon his hunch

unde sams dicks

somewhere in this great country of ours a plot is brewing strange
rumors come seeping in to washington still no one knows anything
what to do 

    uncle sams investigators are put on the job the bureau of investigation
either direct from its main office or from one of its field offices sends investigators
to get the facts

    a branch of the department of justice is working crooks who laugh at the
policeman on the -beat who crack wise at the precinct detective grin at police
chiefs and look slyly at judges tremble when they feel that uncle sam is on their
trail for uncle sam is known to be free of politics immune to graft and
inexorable in his hunt upon the criminal

    yet despite this reputation of the bureau of investigation agents the exact
knowledge of their activities is not general it is well known that a long record of
swift uncovering of evil that untiring zeal to duty and a great daring have
built up a morale that no other organization of its kind seems to have but beyond
that all general knowledge is somewhat hazy

not foperatives

    for instance the indiscriminate use of the title government operative is
all wrong the investigators of the department of justice are called bureau of
investigation agents sometimes they are referred to as operatives instead
of agents but the term must always be preceded by the bureau of investigation
if it is to be strictly correct

    also that a bureau of investigation agent though he is fully empowered for
all bis investigative work cannot make an arrest arrests are made only upon the
issuance of special warrants and then carried out by deputy marshals

    or did you know that bureau of investigation agents are not encouraged to
carry guns in fact the bureau does not furnish guns to the individual agents
these arms are kept at the field stations ready for use

    this does not mean however that the men are always unarmed provisions
is made for them to carry arms whenever they are on special or dangerous mis-
sions their own personal arms by special provision or the arms furnished by the
field office they are legally entitled to carry arms for defensive purposes either
on present cases or to defend themselves at all times against violence either
because of present or past operations

the bureau is headed by the director in washington d c uader his juris-
the shadow magazine



diction are twenty-five field offices located throughout the united states each
field office is under the immediate supervision of a special agent in charge who
has jurisdiction in his respective district of the investigation of all offenses against
the laws of the united states which are under the jurisdiction of the bureau

the duties

     the bureau of investigation has investigative jurisdiction over all violations
of federal laws and matters not specifically assigned by congressional enactment
or otherwise to other federal agencies this of course withdraws its jurisdiction
over violation of counterfeiti ig smuggling postal laws a id immigration laws
and such others as are under their own divisions

     the bureau investigates matters such as the use of stolen vehicles in interstate
or international transportation similarly its duties are in the investigation of
violations of the mann act the bankruptcy violations come under this depart-
ments jurisdiction as well as larceny of goods in interstate commerce and viola-
tions of the trust and national and federal banking laws

    crimes on government reservations theft or damage to government property
and impersonation of government officials becomes part of their task

     its scope further extends to corrupt practices perjury and bribery in con-
nection with federal statutes or officers crimes on the high seas and other federal
statutes

     investigations for the purpose of arresting fugitives from justice by reason
of violations of the federal laws over which the bureau has jurisdiction becomes
still another part of the departments work through this the bureau has built
up one of the most complete identification files in the world and has done a great
deal to prevent the spread of crime with this is a similar service in the keeping
of crime statistics which the bureau maintains

    this is but a part of uncle sams system of getting the criminals who try
to outdo him nevertheless it forms an essential part and deserves the coopera-
tion of all citizens

  

art in prison

    shoemakers basket weavers machinists-all kinds of mechanical workers are
made in our prisons for the program of most of our institutions allows for the
training of the inmates but who would imagine that out of any prison would
come an artist trained in the art behind gray prison walls

    furthermore who would imagine that such could come out of clinton prison
up in the adirondacks where the toughest of men are kept and where a few years
ago a serious prison riot took place

     nevertheless it is true clinton prison has just recently held an exhibition
of paintings done by its inmates inside its own walls

    the regular routine at clinton is being enlarged and this instruction in
painting is the predecessor of similar teaching in wood carving and other arts
the ambitious educational program of the prison has just started but it promises
to develop rapidly


the shadow magazine

    the course in fine art and commercial art is taught entirely by the
inmates the enrollment has reached almost half a hundred in the commercial-art
class and over a dozen in the fine-art division

     prison funds do not allow for the engagement of outside instructors so the
prisoners themselves have assumed the duty the results show that there is a
great deal of talent within prison walls despite the fact that the men are hampered
by lack of models equipment and suitable quarters however all of the students
find the work interesting and enjoyable and take particular pride in their handi-
craft 

     added to the usual mechanical and industrial development of prison instruc-
tion it should not be long before the criminal will have every possible opportunity
to round out his life in perfect fashion to fit himself for useful existence punish-
ment of crime is no longer the guiding force of our law-enforcing institutions it
is correction of crime which counts most

  

checking criminals

         fewer criminals are applying for civil service jobs as the years
    go by perhaps the fact that the civil service applicants are care-
    fully finger printed has had its effect

        during the year  one out of every thirteen persons finger
    printed by the civil service commission was found to have a crim-
    inal record in  the ratio was one in every fourteen and in
     it dropped to one in every twenty-two

         all appointees to the federal service as well as applicants for
    appointment under the civil service rules are carefully finger
    printed the finger-print records are then sent to the bureau of
    investigation of the department of justice for identification

        until recently the records were sent back to the civil service
    commission however the economy program has deleted this
    branch of the commission and the records are now kept in the
    bureaus own quarters

        the bureau of investigation has over three million criminal
    finger prints on file
