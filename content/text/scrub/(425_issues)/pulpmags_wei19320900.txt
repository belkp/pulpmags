  lltar of melek taos

by g g pbndarves

 a thrilling tale of devil-worship of the yezidees and a beautiful woman
 who was to be sacrificed on the altar

	a dinner in bagdad

sir hugh willett caught sight
of his wifes gcld-crowned head
at the far end of the table and
his lips twitched in a smile as he noted
the rapt expression of the gray eyes under
their unexpectedly dark brows and lashes
evidently she was carrying out his in-
structions to keep prince dena amused
with whole-hearted zeal the constant
steady flame of his adoration for evadne
-so young and lovely and gifted-
gave a sudden leap in his breast she
was adorable

  ive never seen evadne look better
hugh

  the voice of the honorable mrs rich-
ard gaunt echoed his own thoughts and
he turned to the well-known writer and
autocrat of london society with an almost
fatuous beam

  this climate suits her suits us both
in fact

  dyou let her run round with her
paint-box here in bagdad as she did in
cairo its not very safe

  do i let her sir hughs face was a
study in mock despair my dear mil-
dred you know evadne pretty well why
revert to the obsolete and empty mockery
of a husbands authority in connection
with evadne

  youre right laughed his dinner
partner but really i must acknowl-
edge she can be trusted ive never met
a girl with her head screwed on more
firmly the only danger is that it is such
an exceptionally charming head just


look at the minx now beguiling that poor
man out of his senses who exactly is
this prince i didnt get his name
prince dena ibn zodh that is his
usual title the whole thing is caid
dena al ilbrahim ibn azzad ibn kadr el
amastan ibn zodh

  mrs gaunt patted his arm soothingly
there there i didnt mean to upset
you like that hughie dear this is not
the time or place for blank verse you
know what have you been drinking
fact replied sir hugh i wrote it
down and learned it while i was having
my bath before dinner

  its a marvel you werent drowned
but tell me seriously hugh what does
the creature do besides looking so ex-
cessively haughty and mysterious and
utterly fascinating i feel like an ingenue
at her first party whenever i look at him
ill tell you later he answered has-
tily my left-hand neighbor seems to be
getting restive shes been a victim to
old doctor hamdi long enough to know
that adventure of his in damascus off by
heart i must rescue her

  the honorable mrs gaunt nibbled a
few salted almonds thoughtfully before
turning to sir hughs secretary hadur
he was an arab of excellent birth and
most scholarly attainments having been
educated at the famous medersa at kair-
wan as a young man he had been kid-
napped by touareggs in the sahara des-
ert sold to slave-traders shipped to mec-
ca and been bought in the slave-market
there by sir hugh willett who recog-
the altar of melek taos



nized his birth and breeding passionate-
ly grateful hadur had refused to return
to his algerian home and had attached
himself to sir hugh as his secretary

  a great friendship had sprung up be-
tween the two which sir hughs recent
marriage had not altered hadur had
merely extended the cloak of his grave
protection and friendship to include the
wife as well as the husband the twenty-
five years that lay between her and him-
self for hadur was some ten years older
than sir hugh made this easy and
evadne accepted the formers unfailing
loyalty as a matter of course she did not
dream of the quite unplatonic devotion
that lay beneath the arabs solemn cour-
tesy nor did he desire that she ever should

know of it hadur was a profound phil-
osopher his dreams were one thing his
actual life another he saw to it that they
never impinged on one another

t am going to ask you what ive been
a asking sir hugh mrs gaunt
turned to hadur at last with an abstracted
air who and what is this prince
hadur presented a sphinx-like face to
her questioning gaze

  i regret madam i can tell you noth-
ing

  cant or wont

   he is here for the first time as guest
hadur countered smoothly sir hugh
met him last week while superintending
the excavation of the daarb temple


weird tales

  yes

  but that is all madam

  nonsense hadur the downright
lady was not to be so easily turned aside
you cant bear the man and youve been
looking like the wrath of allah ever since
the soup do please explain

  i wish i could hadur abandoned
his tone of light pretense i can only
say that there is evil in that man beyond
comprehension i see the sitt evadne by
his side as if she slept within the coils
of a rock python he is entirely devil-
ish

  his companion looked impressed she
was an intimate friend of the house and
trusted hadur completely

  what are you going to do she de-
manded always eminently practical

  hadurs eyes under the folds of his
ruby-silk turban lost a little of their mel-
ancholy at her manner

  the prince is the guest of sir hugh
he reminded her

  guest sir hugh mrs gaunts
snorts of disdain were fortunately
drowned by the lively chatter around
them you know perfectly well that he
would make friends with a bengal tiger
if the beast knew anything about the as-
syrian empire i suppose that is the bond
that brought them together

  the prince is surprizingly well in-
formed conceded hadur

  oh we were just discussing the fall
of babylon she told sir hugh as the
latter relinquished his other neighbor to
doctor hamdi once more

  what her hosts deep chuckling
laugh brought all eyes upon him what
do you suppose old hadur and mildred
were talking about he asked

  a roar of laughter greeted his reply
and mrs gaunt defended herself ably
from the volley of satire that followed

  are you getting foundations for your

next novel one lady demanded baby-
lon will be a nice little change from mod-
ern london dear

  very little change in reality retort-
ed the novelist mere superficialities of
food and clothing the morals and man-
ners of the two cities seem singularly
alike what do you say prince dena

  she appealed across the table as the
latters darkly brilliant face turned in her
direction

  i must confess that my visits to lon-
don have not suggested an analogy he
replied in a deferential manner prob-
ably because ive not had your unique
opportunities of studying it babylon
was different from every other city the
world has known because it drew its
power direct from the supreme source of
power

  a puzzled silence greeted this remark
mrs gaunt stole a glance at hadurs
stern set face and experienced a quiver
of apprehension reflecting on the violent
and sudden nature of oriental reactions

  you are going too deep for some of
us sir hugh voiced the general opin-
ion the philosophy and mysticism of
the east are rather too subtle for me i
confess

  prince dena ibn zodh smiled faintly
and turned his dark face with its chis-
elled features and inscrutable eyes toward
his hostess

  i perceive that you as a mystic are
not out of your depth

  evadne flushed the poetry she wrote
was very much of the mystic order but
she hated talking about it never pub-
lished it and was startled by the princes
divination of her abiding interest

  you refer to the perverted use to
which the magi of the assyrian empire
put their gifts hadur gravely inter-
posed successfully distracting interest
from lady willetts slight confusion
the altar of melek taos



  perverted use the princes level
gaze clashed with hadurs intent look

  surely asserted the latter in the
flat gentle voice that heralded his rare an-
ger since these same magi forgot or
ignored the mysterious laws of equilib-
rium which subjugated the universe to
their control forsaking the law they
played with magic for the delight of king
and courtiers intoxicating them with
every sensual joy they forsook ormuzd
for ahriman and brought the assyrians
to the dust

so prince dena paused a dark
flame in his eyes you recollect how-
ever that from ashes sprang the phenix
and from the dust of babylon

sprang- hadur also paused

  the guests sat in tense silence as if
aware that some tremendous question had
been asked the atmosphere was electric
with the antagonism between the two
men

  from the dust of babylon sprang the
angel peacock-melek taos

   the prince raised his hand as he spoke
the candles-burning steadily in their
crystal holders down the long table-
flared up into high tendrils of flame the
hanging lamps overhead and in the wall-
niches blazed with a sudden blue-white
radiance a golden flower-scented mist
filled the spacious room the sound of a
reed-pipe thin and piercingly sweet
drew the listeners souls from their bodies
there was a perfume of musk and am-
bergris and roses the gleam of night-
dark eyes of polished limbs and half-
veiled bosoms

  and in prince denas place a young
monarch sat ablaze with jewels and rain-
bow-tinted silks who waved a languid
hand to tall veiled figures that hovered
behind his throne even as he waved
the radiant mist dispelled the candles
and lamps burned slow and steadily

again and the bewildered company sat
staring foolishly at one anothers familiar

faces

  who-who are you evadnes slen-
der hand was at her throat as she turned
to prince dena then with an uncertain
little laugh she snatched at the conven-
tions

  why you perfectly marvelous man
thats the most wonderful illusion ive
ever seen out here youre a real sorcerer
i believe

  the devil he is muttered old doctor
hamdi annoyed at being so completely
tricked i beg your pardon mrs fair-
leigh he apologized but did you see
it all too those delightful    er-r-r   
houris

  i certainly did answered the scan-
dalized mrs fairleigh you might have
warned us we were to be treated to con-
juring sir hugh i strongly disapprove
of this sort of thing its quite against
my principles to allow myself to be hyp-
notized

  dont blame our host the princes
amused voice cut in it was entirely un-
premeditated merely an answer to our
learned friend here and he nodded to
hadur

  the secretary did not reply he had
begun to peel a mandarin orange and his
eyes were on his plate

  certainly more spectacular than the
indian rope trick pronounced the hon-
orable mrs gaunt endeavoring to re-
capture her skepticism i suppose you
wouldnt condescend to explain the mys-
tery prince

  not a question of condescension
madam he assured her it was based
on rules whose existence you westerners
deny the results of magic are obvious
to your senses but the history and deriva-
tion of magic you would class with heath-
en mythology and folk-lore


weird tales

  the touch of fear on lady willetts
face the bewildered look in her eyes
gave her loveliness a lost unearthly air
that made sir hugh long to rush to her
side mrs gaunt seeing her dazed con-
dition did not wait for a signal to rise
but got to her feet commanded the rest
of the women with an imperious gesture
and put her arm through that of her
hostess as they went from the room

  dear child youve got fever better
take some quinine at once

  no millicent not fever evadnes
voice was low and shaken i think-
i feel there was something quite awful
behind that illusion we saw i simply
hated it

  darling youre much too easily im-
pressed by these orientals wait until
youve been mixed up with them ten years
or so as i have youll learn to take them
less seriously it was clever very but
not really devastating

  it was quite awful repeated evadne
certainly it was mrs fairleigh
chimed in as they sank into low chairs
in the wide stone gallery that ran round
the house a most improper thing
these natives have no sense of decency at
all

m

ell it was a good show tonight
thanks to the prince i thought
theyd all stay on to breakfast talking
about magic and djinnees and suspended
animation and all the rest of it even
little mrs fairleigh got wound up
evadne nodded her clear eyes still
shadowed by a faint fear

  but you were as silent as an oyster
old fellow what got your goat tonight
there must be listeners for those who
talk hadur answered dryly

  you werent listening you were sulk-
ing you old reprobate what was it
did mrs gaunt ride her hobby-horse

about the meccan pilgrimage or does
the prince belong to a tribe of your heredi-
tary enemies

  as to that he is not more my enemy
than yours

  evadne looked vaguely about her for
a cigarette and hadur was quick to see
her need she stretched out a firm deli-
cately modelled little hand and turned
it palm upward to look idly at the gold
lettering on the cigarette

  by the hundredth name of allah
exclaimed hadur what mark is that
he took her hand in his own lean dark
fingers and bent over the soft rosy palm
a faint curious mark was printed there
silver-gray as wood ash

  ate the exclamation burst from
hadur as if a mortal agony seized him
allahs mercy on us when was this
done to you

  why-how very curious lady
willett stared at the mark with puzled
brows

  did the prince touch you think-
remember-was it when he worked his
magic at the dinner table

  yes i remember now i felt a little
tingle on my hand when the candies
flared up it was a peculiar pain and
went right through me i looked at my
hand afterward but there was no mark
there i cant feel anything now but it
wont come off-it wont come off

  she scrubbed at her palm with a shud-
der of distaste and showed the mark to
hugh standing by her side

  i dont know quite why you and
hadur are making such a fuss he was
tenderly scornful youve scraped the
skin a little come along ill put plas-
ter and ointment and a large bandage
on it darling then youll be happy
it is the sign of melek taos-the
mark of power hadurs voice was low
and hoarse you can do nothing sir
the altar of melek taos



hugh for the sitt evadne has been chos-
en by the prince to be-wa hyat ullah
these lips will not utter the words

  what do you mean hadur sir
hugh was suddenly stem and angry
dont you see that you are alarming
evadne explain-dont stand there mut-
tering arabic to yourself

  my lord it was seldom indeed
that hadur used his native speech and a
chill of fear touched the others heart at
the profound solemnity of hadurs voice
and manner my lord it is wiser to
tell thee at the outset what great evil
hath befallen the sitt evadne it is so
grave and overwhelming a disaster that
ignorance would be the last extremity of
unwisdom that marie is the mark of
melek taos-the angel peacock-the
symbol of that bright prince of evil whose
rule ended temporarily at the fall of
babylon

   if i didnt know you for a strict mo-
hammedan id say youd been drinking
sir hugh interrupted frowning what
has evadne to do with the fall of baby-
lon what in hell-excuse me darling
-what on earth is an angel peacock
you were right in saying hell re-
plied hadur the angel peacock is the
symbol for the devil a shaitan the age-
less evil which men have worshipped
from the beginning of time

   evadne looked with fascinated horror
at her hand

   it is getting plainer all the time she
gasped look there are wings a head
it is a bird more like an eagle or a vul-
ture than a peacock

  both men bent over her hand the
silvery-gray mark was deepening to a dull
black and as evadne turned her hand
this way and that it shimmered with
gleaming opalescent hues

   it is very beautiful-very

  hadur turned on her with a desperate
terror

  beautiful accursed you mean you
must not be fascinated by it cover it up
you must not let that mark work on you
as the prince intends

  sir hugh drew her to sit beside him on
a divan close by putting his own hand
over the strange mark and holding evad-
ne within the shelter of his arm his in-
stinct and training prompted him to make
light of the whole thing he did not want
his wife to be frightened and he had
always made a habit of resolutely turning
his back on the numerous occult phenom-
ena which he encountered in the east
not that he blundered by showing the
natives his complete disbelief in their
many superstitions with the exception of
hadur but he cherished the belief hat
nothing supernatural could or did exist

  something deeper than either instinct
or training stirred in him now with a
quite inexplicable hatred he hated to see
that glittering mark on evadnes hand
some fear ancient and primeval as the
foundation of the world began to trou-
ble him over dim unsuspected pools of
memory an old and terrible wisdom
moved with portentous shadow

  tell us all you know or think or
suspect he asked hadur

  the arab bent his head gravely and
sat down opposite the pair

	the very voice of fire

t will give you the facts as i know
a them began hadur hear me
out however incredulous and repellent
you find them

  his audience nodded agreement sir
hugh with a sinking heart

  prince dena ibn zodh is high priest
of the tribe known as the yezidees these
people are devil-worshippers and have
been for many centuries in the time of


weird tales

shaikh adi their chief exponent the
yezidees bulked largely as a terrible and
dangerous sect they have a sacred black
book called al yalvah and in the thir-
teenth century reached their zenith as a
ruling influential power of evil since
that time their power steadily declined
but the old reputation clung to them and
jews and moslems and christians alike
despised and hated them

  in reality until quite recently they
had become a perfectly harmless peasant
tribe whose communities lie scattered in
the hills northeast of bagdad and in
other countries such as kurdistan arme-
nia and persia they practised a few
rites and ceremonies grown harmless
and unmeaning during the passage of
time they adhered to a few supersti-
tions such as never wearing the color
blue and never speaking of the devil by
that name the shaitan they worship is
symbolized for them in the form of a
peacock a marvellously wrought be-
jewelled bird represents their god to the
tribe and is kept in some secret sanctuary
when referring to their devil ruler they
call him melek taos or angel peacock

  evadne looked down at her hand but
her husband closed it almost fiercely
within his own and drew her closer to
him

  melek taos is something akin to
lucifer only that the yezidees think he
will return in time to his celestial sphere
and that he rules this earth meantime
by the direct command of allah until
recently in spite of these strange beliefs
the yezidees lived normally honest de-
cent lives their religion was a mere
shell of the old faith melek taos a focus
for their instinct to worship the old
unspeakable sacrifices and horrible per-
versions of human attributes were com-
pletely forgotten

  and the prince what has he to do
with all this asked sir hugh

  everything he has revived the old
infamous worship in its entirety every
custom and sacrifice and obscenity of the
devil-worship of the dark ages melek
taos from being more angel than devil
is now utteriy and wholly devilish his
worshippers indulge in every form of
beast-like lust and unnamable orgy tor-
ture sacrifice the bridal rights of the
high priest and other abominations have
been fully re-established

  hadur looked hesitatingly at the young
couple his eyes haunted and tragic

  there is worse much worse to come
he went on these things are the mere
trappings and superficialities of the devil-
worshippers under the new regime of
prince dena

  good god man exclaimed sir
hugh no human being could do
worse than this surely

  human being well yes as far as
his body of flesh and blood is concerned
he is human hadur spoke slowly and
heavily but the prince has learned a
power and a control that set him as far
apart from human life thought and ex-
perience as a great scientist is removed
from the organic life beneath his micro-
scope or on his dissecting-table

  you are angry alarmed bewildered
it is natural yet i beg you to remain
calm while i try to make clear what will
bewilder you still more these yezidees
were disciples of the false zoroaster in
the past their ancestors treasured rem-
nants of knowledge and power from the
days of long-forgotten kingdoms-lost
in the mists of time even when the as-
syrians ruled but these remnants of pow-
er perished and were buried beneath the
stones of babylon the last secrets of
zoroaster vanished in the general holo-
caust

  the true zoroaster born six thousand
years before plato according to many
savants learned the great principles that
control the universe he and his magi
held the elements in the hollow of their
hands above all things they learned
the secret and occult force that governs
fire electricity was subject to them and
answered to their control as a horse an-
swers to bit and bridle

  they learned through long discipline
and terrible ordeals of purification to
liberate the will entirely from the senses
until they could hear the very voice of
fire until they could focus the universal
fire-the astral fluid that radiates from
every sphere in the universe-and direct
it as a weapon or a defense when they
pleased

  the voice of fire taught them to be-
come seers and prophets to impose any
thought or feeling upon the multitude to
make themselves visible or invisible at
will to communicate with other magi at
the far ends of the earth

  how sir hugh questioned harshly

  by means of huge power-houses
where the electric fluid was stored-seven
great towers which stretched across the
continent of asia from arabia to tibet
these towers have long since crumbled
into dust but prince dena has erected
a new one here in the hills somewhere
north of this city and i have informa-
tion from those who work for me in this
matter that other towers are being built
in persia afghanistan and mongolia

  here not twenty miles from bagdad
the prince rules with all the absolute sov-
ereignty of the magi of the assyrian
empire he has protected his temple
and palace with the fire-mist and thunder
clouds of the priests of babylon he has
diverted the rivers which flooded and de-
stroyed the old yezidee altars he has
built his tower over these same altars and

there the living flame burns night and

day

  how have you learned all this youve
been with me for years and ive never
heard a word of prince dena i knew
the yezidees existed but that was all
have you seen the tower the altar and
all the rest of it

  when you journeyed to europe with
the sitt and left me here in bagdad i
met a man whose daughter had been sac-
rificed to melek taos by the prince him-
self i may not betray her name-it was
a great one and very honored here in
bagdad her father has great learning
and greater courage by an accident i
stumbled on his secret purpose to avenge
his daughter and since then he and i
have worked together in disguise this
man has visited the temple joined in
the worship and never rests now in his
plans to destroy the yezidees root and
branch but so far-

  he made an eloquent gesture of de-
spair

  i am not quite clear about the true
and the false zoroastrians evadnes
face was pale but her eyes were intent
and steady her mind absorbed byhadurs
words and the prince himself is he a
true magus

  he was replied hadur it is that
which makes him so unassailable now
he passed through all the sternest tests
and ordeals he became an adept he
learned all the occult mysteries that con-
trol the elements he heard the very
voice of fire and only death can rob
him of his power now although he has
turned it to base and unworthy uses the
fire he controls will destroy him utterly
at last as it destroyed sardanapalus on
his throne in babylon meantime-he
rules

i have told you all sitt hadur met
the girls stedfast eyes i have told you


weird tales

because ignorance would expose you to
greater risk you must understand com-
pletely the kind of danger that threatens
you

  i know i understand hadur

  evadne felt her husbands hand trem-
ble on her own and turned to him quick-
ly his angry puzzled look touched her
profoundly

  darling dont worry this is the
twentieth century and we are in bag-
dad not babylon i think prince dena
is a terrible man i felt it from the first
moment we met but hell have a hard
time to get me into his temple with all
his magic and mysteries dont look at
me as if i were sitting in a tumbril on
the way to the guillotine remember
were in the east where one expects all
sorts of things to happen

  sir hughs gloom visibly lightened

  youre an absolute wonder really you
are and hadurs flashing glance con-
firmed her husbands admiration well
tackle this thing together and bring
prince dena lower than the walls of baby-
lon itself

  hadur fingered a cigarette his eyes
lowered he had failed to convince sir
hugh but he felt assured that evadnes
attitude was more or less assumed for
her husbands benefit she was the more
intellectual of the two more inclined to
the mysticism of the east understanding
much that lay outside the range of sir
hughs strong practical mind more imagi-
native and receptive of the older philoso-
phies and if more credulous at the same
time more subtle and flexible in her
thought

  meantime he saw her glance down at
her hand and the question he dreaded
followed promptly and the mark
hadur

  it is the mark that the high priest
sets upon his chosen you are the woman

whom he has destined to be offered to
melek taos on the night of sacrifice at
the rising of the next new moon

  sir hugh rose abruptly his anger sud-
denly breaking bounds

  dont couple evadnes name with
that beastly conjurers its an insult in
itself if only a quarter of what you say is
true it is my fault that she has been ex-
posed to his presumption i was a fool
to have been taken in by him in the first
place i shall see that he never comes
near her again confound him that mark
can be removed by caustic or electricity
ill take her to a doctor tomorrow
hadur watched the couple go evadnes
smile to him over her shoulder was par-
ticularly gentle and affectionate and the
arabs eyes were dim as he watched her
golden head and cloudy draperies disap-
pear down the long corridor without

  allah have her in his keeping to
save her i would burn in gehenna for a
thousand years to save her

for a few days sir hugh anxious to
prevent any chance that might bring
evadne into contact with prince dena
again refused to go away from the city
or even to stay more than an hour or two
away from his wife but as the days
passed uneventfully the thought of his
workmen in the euphrates valley began
to worry him they had reached a critical
point in a most important job when the
tomb of queen bal-el-zouka was to be
uncovered it was essential that he should
superintend the opening of the inner
stone chamber only he possessed such
experience and expert knowledge as was
necessary for such a delicate operation

  hadur was on the spot overlooking
the workmen and no doubt could carry
out the final diggings as well as he could
himself unless some unexpected difficulty
the altar of melek taos



turned up it was the chance of this last
occurrence that worried sir hugh

  his strong common sense and cheerful
optimism had quickly thrown off the
vague alarm and suspicion he had first
entertained with regard to the prince as
the days quietly succeeded one another
the tomb of queen bal-el-zouka loomed
larger as the prince faded on his mental
horizon

  i really ought to ride up the valley
and see how things are going he re-
marked at breakfast one morning

  of course why dont you go today
i shall be busy all morning the consul
and his wife are calling to take me to an
exhibition of rugs at the hotel el kadr

  sir hughs face cleared completely

  splendid youll be careful though
wont you darling that fellow prince
dena may be hanging about on the
chance of seeing you ive given strict
orders that he is not to be admitted on
any pretext whatever if those two are
with you today-

  exactly laughed evadne i hardly
think even prince dena would tackle so
formidable a team mrs lamont would
die rather than acknowledge the strain of
arab blood in her and snubs all natives
impartially and he-well he sees peo-
ple and things as she wants him to see
them

  poor fellow i can sympathize with
him i know exactly what he feels like
sir hugh looked as dismal as his jolly
face would allow we must get to-
gether he and i and talk over this wife
business cant call my soul my own
now

  poor old thing

  she had accompanied him to the en-
trance hall as they talked and they stood
looking down at the sunlit streets in the
shadow of the deep moorish arch she
suddenly clasped him with the quick

warmth that made her so adorable to
him

  you are so dear and silly hugh i
simply couldnt live without you now-
the sillier you get the more i like you
thats lucky as im heading in the
same direction about you now listen to
the parting injunction of a fond but jeal-
ous spouse if you see the prince cut
him dead by the way youve still got
the bandage over that mark the doctor
said you might remove it today didnt
he

  i think i ought to give it until to-
night it was a rather painful process
having it pricked out it may heal better
if i wait a few hours longer

  in the deep shadow her sudden flush
was not noticeable she had already un-
covered her hand and seen the mark as
clear and strong as ever but meant to
consult hadur before showing it to her
husband the latter had been hanging
about so miserably restless for the last
week that she wished him to go off with-
out anxiety today

  poor child he patted the injured
hand tenderly well if im going ill
ride out now before the sun gets any
higher you may expect hadur and me
back tonight without fail hell be sur-
prized to see me turn up

  a last kiss and he set off down the
street to the stables his white-clad figure
very square and uncompromising amidst
the flowing burnooses and rainbow hues
of the native population

hadur was not only surprized but
passionately angry with sir hugh
filled with an almost murderous fury as
he watched him approach the camp

  blind worm is he made of wood or
stone that he can leave her to the mercy
of that devil oh by allah i could bind
him on a wild horse and flog him into the


weird tales

desert for this treachery to her he has
left her lost her for ever the blind dull-
witted fool

  then in a moment his rare anger
passed he saw sir hugh not as the
traitor but as the betrayed and immense
pity and sorrow filled him

  el mektoub mektoub he quoted
beneath his breath if he must lose her
then she is already lost of what use to
strive against ones fate is it not hung
about our neck from the hour of our
birth we do but tread a path already
ordained for our feet

  sir hugh looked slightly abashed as he
rode up to hadur and busied himself
with his mount for a minute with averted
eyes

  evadnes splendid he presently re-
marked rather jerkily going off with
the lamont griffin and her husband to-
day ive given strict orders not to have
the prince admitted to the house you
and i will be back at sundown

  it is well arfi hadur led the way
to the tomb without more words and sir
hugh followed meekly knowing that he
was in disgrace but the feeling of guilt
was swallowed up in excitement very
soon and for the remaining hours of the
day he was too much absorbed to remem-
ber that such aman as prince dena ex-
isted at all

the domes and minarets of bagdad
glowed redly in the setting sun as
sir hugh with his secretary dismounted
at the stables and walked toward his
spacious white house in the avenue of the
califs a servant usually sat within the
entrance to question all who climbed
the broad steps and to receive messages
if his master and mistress were not at
home this evening the great arched
doorway was deserted the heavily
studded door was closed

  sir hugh was about to give a loud
rat-tat-tat with the stock of his riding-
whip when hadur put a hand on his
arm

  something has gone wrong let us
enter quietly and make our own discov-
eries there are other entrances

  there were several of them and the
two men found the glass door leading
into the palm garden was unlatched
they walked in quietly through a con-
servatory of heavily scented plants and
thence into sir hughs private study a
strange pall of silence seemed to fill the
house almost visibly

  in the wide tiled hall they saw a figure
sprawled against the marble wall it was
ali the doorkeeper he was sleeping
and so soundly that nothing would rouse
him hadur examined him swiftly lift-
ing an eyelid feeling his pulse

  not drugged he is hypnotized he
pronounced

  prince dena

  sir hughs face was suddenly haggard
with anxiety hadurs did not change
from the settled melancholy it had worn
all day with one accord they turned
letting the servant slip back against the
wall they mounted the great curved
central stairway and reached the western
wing through a labyrinthin maze of cor-
ridors and passages

  they paused in the small anteroom
which led to a lovely domed chamber
where silken rugs made glowing pools of
color on the marble floors and cushions
and divans and rich hangings formed a
background worthy of the great haroun
ar rashid himself

  the anteroom was shut off only by
curtains of damask silk and between
them the two men saw something that
made them stiffen and freeze like game
dogs still and motionless as statues

  on a divan opposite across a wide
the altar of melek taos



space of floor evadne lay relaxed against
a pile of gorgeous cushions her head
shone like a golden torch in the last rays
of the setting sun her delicately cut fea-
tures touched to an almost unearthly
beauty

  beside her sat prince dena ibn zodh
his face in profile like a classic bronze
against the window through which a
crimson afterglow blazed he leaned
toward his companion and the low mur-
mur of a strange rhythmic chant reached
the two behind the curtain

  like a flower turning to the sun the
girls face turned toward the prince her
gray eyes wide and shining her lips part-
ed in delight she swayed smiling
closer closer to the dark intent singer
his two hands went out to her held the
golden head cupped between them as he
crooned with a wild soft wail at the close
of each verse

	ye red mist o ye swift flame

      melek taos by that bright name

       	serve thee with beauty

      ahyahaiee ahyahaiee

      dancing red fire dancing white fire

      leap nearer leap higher

       baptize this thy bond-slave

      ahyahaiee ahyahaiee

  sir hugh made an agonizing effort to
move to speak to rush in and snatch
evadne to him he could not stir a mus-
cle at his side hadur might have been
carved from wood not a tremble or a
breath shook him as he also stood rooted
to the floor

  prince dena bent down to the lovely
face between his two hands and his chant
sank to a low mutter breathed against her
parted lips

to thy altar melek taos to thy altar o king
at the rising of the new moon melek taos i
bring

these white limbs this gold head in thy bright
  arms to lie

vau jotchavah

vau opharim

vau ruach addonai

evadnes lips touched those of the

prince clung there while sir hugh was
forced to watch with bursting heart his
will his spirit his whole being rose up
in an agony of effort like a great force
of water breaking down a dam with a
flashing of stars in his head and a dread-
ful jolt of leaping pulses he came to life

  he gave a queer moan of fury and
leaped forward dragging down the cur-
tain to his feet his hands were at prince
denas throat his muscles tensed his
whole intent to batter the life out of that
smiling dark face to his bewilderment
he grasped only empty air prince dena
stood at the window looking out calmly
evadne lay back among the gorgeously
hued cushions her eyes wide and vacant
as a sleep-walkers

  it is useless hadurs hand restrained
him his whisper was in his ear he is
protected you will injure yourself but
him you can not touch

  sir hugh brushed off the warning
hand like an insect

  let me alone let me alone this
is my job

  once more he hurled himself at prince
dena who stood with his back now to
the window his black eyes gleaming with
fire sir hugh felt a tingling shock that
left him numb from head to foot and he
leaned heavily against the window-casing
to steady his trembling limbs

  again he flung himself upon that
sleek smiling enemy there was a cry
a crash of broken glass and sir hugh
hung perilously from the window-frame
caught by a jagged edge of glass and
hadurs strong hand about his ankle it
was an ignominious struggle to get back
to safety he stood within the room fi-
nally panting tom bleeding and with
a fury that made his ears sing and a mist
clouded his eyes

  prince dena bowed with ironic gravity
i have the honor to bid you farewell
sir hugh willett


weird tales

  he turned to evadne

  to our next meeting white flower
of paradise

  he took her hand and carried it to his
lips and in a moment had crossed the
threshold of the room and vanished more
swiftly than a passing breeze

ts vadne cried sir hugh desper-
-e- ately as she rose with a sudden
energy to look down from the window to
the street below

  but the girl appeared completely in-
sensitive to his cry and to the pain and
anger in his face she stood with face
pressed eagerly to an unbroken pane and
returning finally to her seat she sank
down and gazed vacantly before her

  evadne her husband sat down be-
side her his voice rough with amazed
anger what are you thinking of are
you mad to let this beast kiss you turn
you into a thing of wax evadne look
at me listen listen evadne

  but the face he turned toward him
with shaking hand beneath her chin was
calm and still the eyes brilliant but their
expression fixed and far away-the look
of a traveller who gazes with deep long-
ing on some distant land of desire blind
and deaf to all other objects in the way

                          m

  hadur stood back in the shadow against
the wall watching evadne closely he
looked years older than before he entered
the room a dreadful grayness about his
mouth his wise deep-set eyes were pools
of brooding horror

  sir hugh he came forward at last
and stood looking down at the young
man as a father might look at a stricken
child we came too late to save her
alas the evil is past remedy she will
not hear your voice again she will not
see your face again in her ears the voice
of the high priest drowns every other
sound in the universe and in her vision

she sees only the bright evil spirit that
has bound her to him it has been de-
creed that this fate should come upon us
all it is the will of allah

  nonsense hadur the arab fatal-
ism had the effect at least of rousing the
other to battle why should allah de-
cree a thing of such awful horror it is
the result of my own carelessness i left
her-i left her evadne

  his voice was softly pleading now he
took her hand between his own stroking
it talking softly to her as if she were a
wayward child then he and hadur no-
ticed the mark on her hand simultaneous-
ly and both their faces paled

  god whispered sir hugh

  the mark shone red as fire brilliant
opalescent baneful a dark star in the
dusk of that gorgeous room and as the
mark burned deeper and brighter so did
evadnes beauty catch fire and glow with
a new unearthly radiance

  again and again sir hugh tried to
rouse her only to find her in the mist of
dreams where she walked alone it was
useless the gulf between them yawned
as wide as death itself

 flight

t ve ordered the car round for seven-
a thirty this evening lady willetts
maid can follow when she has finished
packing the trunks well take the light
luggage with us its rather awkward
about leaving the excavation work but
if you return here after seeing us off at
port said it will make very little differ-
ence youll have all those letters and
contracts ready for me to sign before i
go hadur

  since your mind is made up i will
have all in readiness replied the secre-
tary gravely wont you reconsider this
decision sir hugh you are making a
grave mistake and playing into the

                        w t-f
the altar of melek taos



enemys hands by this hasty move to
travel in haste by night and without
preparation or defense against attack is
to give the sitt evadne into his hands
what defense have we if half you
suspect is true not that i can credit your
beliefs in his magic all i know is that
she has been hypnotized by this infernal
scoundrel and that im going to take her
where shell be safe from the sight and
sound of him

  my dear hadur reverted to his na-
tive arabic and mode of address when
profoundly moved anger and sorrow
blind thee to the truth there are means
of protection if thou wert willing to sub-
mit the width of the wide earth be-
tween the sitt evadne and this magus
will avail nothing she bears the mark
of the angel peacock on her hand the
visible sign of her inner subjugation
until that mark fades she belongs to the
high priest who set it upon her

  good heavens man what more can
i do to have the mark removed if the
electric needle cant touch it what can
one thing alone hadur answered
solemnly the high priest must die
until he does it is useless to take refuge
in flight and it will but bring a heavier
weight of evil upon us all

  the others face clouded

  i wish i could stay and settle him
myself he patted a pocket significantly
but when you return i give you
carte blanche to use my name and draw
on me for any money you need to get rid
of him if you could get the authorities
on his track let them discover this beastly
sacrifice business you say he practises it
ought to be easy to get him hanged as a
common murderer

no no hadurs eyes held despair
have i not said he was protected no
human weapon no human force can
harm a magus of his standing he has
w t-

mastered the deepest secrets of zoroaster
and it would be childs play for him to
avoid the clumsy traps that the law would
set for him

  well what remains

  fire the universal agent the
prince trod the bitter path of knowledge
passing from stage to stage until con-
trol of his senses was absolute he has
heard the very voice of fire like the
false magi of old he no longer practises
the tests and ordeals of discipline he is
using the occult forces of nature for his
own ends not for the purpose of giving
light and wisdom to the world only ut-
ter negation of self is his safeguard

therefore he is bound to-

  yes yes you explained that the
other night meantime the prince holds
all the winning cards

  it is true he is master as long as he
controls the universal agent but you
have a saying the mills of god grind
slowly but they grind exceeding small
and so it is in this matter the law is
always the same call it god or nature
or magic-all are the same

  everything you say persuades me that
to protect my wife i must act and act at
once i cant wait for the prince to be
caught in his own toils

  and i repeat that you have not the
strength or knowledge to protect her
prince dena must be tricked into expos-
ing himself to the full force of the un-
tamable element he uses so dangerously
fire protects him fire must destroy
him

  hadur sir hugh got up and put-
ting his hand on the others shoulders
looked him squarely in the face i trust
you beyond any man i know you have
been friend and adviser to me through
bad times and good for more years than
i can remember now for the first time
i can not rely on your judgment i did


weird tales

not realize clearly before that i am a
westerner and that you are of the east
i can not follow your arguments i must
take my own way of dealing with a prob-
lem so peculiarly my own my mind is
made up i am taking evadne away out
of the country tonight

  with a sinking heart the secretary
watched the other go off to his study

  allah hath permitted his eyes to be
blinded that he may not see the truth
he told himself wearily all haste is of
the devil and of this sudden ill-consid-
ered journey much evil will come

the moon had a red angry look as
it climbed up that night to peer
over the shoulder of the mosque elharib
at the big touring-car standing before sir
hugh willetts doorway the air was
heavy the stars dim and a breathless
heat hung like a pall over the city

  evadne stood for a moment on the top-
most step looking up at the red disk of
the moon her lifted face so tranquil and
exquisite that a passing beggar drew back
with a startled ya salam of a truth
the unbeliever hath surely drunk of the
seven streams of isfadan by allah it is
a beauty not of this earth

  come darling sir hugh gently
urged her i think a storm is coming
up

  she did not appear to know he was
speaking but continued to watch the an-
gry sky a low long mutter of thunder
rolled and she smiled faintly

  in the voice of the thunder i will
speak to you in the flash of the light-
ning you shall see my wrath against those
who would hide you from me

  she spoke as if quoting remembered
words and sir hugh exchanged uneasy
glances with hadur

  not until the three had left bagdad a
mile or so behind them and were speed-

ing up the long valley road did sir hugh
begin to feel easy in his mind hadur in
the back of the car with the luggage sat
anxiously watching the threatening sky

  as the road narrowed to a mere rough
track between the towering hills a sud-
den fury of wind tore shrieking down
the defile to meet them a curtain of ut-
ter darkness fell the road was unfamil-
iar a short cut to their destination which
friends in bagdad had recommended it
forked to right and left at more than one
point and in spite of instructions which
he endeavored to follow precisely sir
hugh became convinced that somewhere
in the darkness he had taken the wrong
turn

  he determined to drive on in the
chance of reaching some village or at
least of finding some protected place
where they might shelter until the ap-
proaching storm had spent itself

  hadur voiced his own misgivings
we seem to have missed the road i
believe we are on the way to the hills
where the yezidees have their strong-
hold can you turn sir hugh it is
madness to court disaster

  i can not turn in this narrow place
we must go on now

  it is madness repeated hadur it
is the power of the high priest that
draws us on this path

  a clap of thunder echoing and pro-
longed filled the narrow valley with
deafening tumult hadurs watchfulness
increased and he sat like a dog straining
at the leash his eyes fixed on the skyline
above the hills sir hugh gave his whole
attention to the wheel with a darting
glance every once in a while at his wife
who sat beside him with a strange look
of expectancy and hope in her eyes

  the coppery glow above the dark hills
grew stronger and lightning began to
flick in long tongues of fire from peak to
the altar of melek taos



peak the car bumped and rocked over
the uneven track the occupants one mo-
ment dazzled by the dancing incandescent
blaze the next plunged into a black sul-
furous gloom

  the storm seemed to be following the
kne of the valley with the car the center
and focus of its fury hadur looked
through the rear window to see a clear
sky behind overhead the rattle and
roar of thunder threatened to shake the
solid hills down upon the travellers

  sir hughs face was white and set as
he clung to the wheel steering more or
less by instinct in the darkness and in-
fernal uproar the road began to climb
steeply the hills drawing in until their
jagged peaks almost touched overhead
at a heart-breaking double twist in the
road the car plunged into a shallow fis-
sure that stretched across the way the
engine coughed gurgled sullenly and
went dead

  the two men got out opened the hood
and poked about anxiously to discover
the damage hadur holding an electric
torch nothing seemed wrong puzzled
sir hugh turned to enter the car again
and examine the switchboard more care-
fully

  the car was empty evadne had van-
ished

  evadne evadne evadne

  sir hughs voice rang through the hol-
low-sounding place with a startled terror
that the rocky walls threw back in a hun-
dred echoes hadur sent the ray of his
powerful torch up and down the path
but only the desolate track itself was visi-
ble sir hugh ran forward stumbling
to his knees in haste calling running
falling and blindly running on again

  then a mighty burst of thunder ac-
companied by a violent shaking of the
earth flung both men to the ground and
a second later the sky was split by a mon-

strous sheet of white fire that threatened
to wipe the very earth from its appointed
place and scatter its ashes amidst the star-
dust in the void

for long the two lay stunned and
blind and deaf the earth rocking un-
der them at last hadur crawled on
hands and knees to the others side

  look

  he pointed an unsteady hand to the
craggy summit almost directly overhead
a great arc of light burned steadily a
rainbow of gleaming fire and beneath it
the black massive wallsof a building
stood humped against the sky near
by a taller building loomed whose metal
domes and towers reflected the red
light of the fiery arc above a single
straight gleaming tower shot up into the
sky its slender shaft quivering from base
to head with constantly moving fight
waves like dancing water beneath a bril-
liant moon

  the palace of the yezidees and the
temple of melek taos and there-
there is the sitt evadne

   still on their hands and knees the two
turned their faces toward that fiery rain-
bow and on the very summit of the crags
a man and woman stood plainly visible
in the brilliant light

  it was prince dena and with him
evadne in her white-furred wrap still
partly stunned sir hugh got to his feet
wavering and unsteady and tried to shout
his voice died in his throat and his
numbed arm fell heavily to his side as he
strove to signal to that small white-clad
figure poised like a bird on the dark
heights above the valley

   with a roar a cataract of rain fell like
a black curtain beating the two men to
their knees again blotting out the fiery
arc and the castle and temple swallow-
ing up the slender figure and the tall
high priest by her side

  in a very few minutes the path turned
to an icy foaming torrent beneath the
feet of the dazed watchers it was imoos-

ing in that swirling rush of water

  	the trap opens-and shuts

dawn found them flattened up against
the overhanging precipice soaked
chilled to the bone and aching in every
muscle underfoot the water was abating
though running swiftly as a river in spate
down the precipitous way

  the car stood axle-deep in the yellow-
ish flood the fissure holding it firmly in
position thankfully the two men
splashed to its shelter and were soon dry-
clad and enjoying hot coffee and cognac
from their travelling-flasks as well as the
contents of a well-stocked food basket

  the sun rose over the edge of the val-
ley walls as they ate and in a very short
time its rays beat down in full strength
into the winding defile illuminating
every crack and cranny in it

  there it is exclaimed sir hugh as
they once more stepped out into the now
rapidly diminishing water and were ex-
amining the cliff face to find the track
by which evadne and the prince had
climbed on the previous night there
behind that outstanding boulder

  they squeezed in behind a great mass
of stone and found a firm clearly de-
fined track which wound in wide-flung
loops across the face of the rock barely
visible from the road level once discov-
ered it was an obvious and easy ascent

  halting at the top they surveyed the
desolate wind-swept heights and the
massive walls of the yezidee stronghold
in the brilliant sun the light was reflected
from every dome and roof but chiefly
focussed on the tall slender shaft of the

shining tower which rose like a pillar
of fire from amidst the temple domes
its light was not steady but flashed and
winked like that of a lighthouse signal
with a radiance that made it impossible
to watch it continuously

  its a sort of super-heliograph as-
serted sir hugh they are signaling to
their brother yezidees no doubt noth-
ing of a miraculous nature about it the
material theyve used in the tower is ex-
ceptional i admit i never saw anything
attract the suns rays so powerfully on
the other hand the sun itself is a miracle
out here

  hadur made no attempt to rob his
companion of the comfort of this logical
explanation of the wonder before them
he knew that the light-rays from that
infernal tower drew their power from
every shining star and planet in the uni-
verse and that they sent out a force that
touched people and events as far removed
as the poles the universal agent was
concentrated and focussed here gathered
up by means of the tower into a vast
storehouse in the identical manner in
which the true disciples of zoroaster had
learned to gather and store it thousands
of years ago

  for good or evil a blind terrific force
was harnessed here to earth and the
thought of it in the hands of prince dena
made hadur shudder to the soul

  those fellows by the gate are watch-
ing us wed better try to gain admit-
tance there

  sir hugh walked resolutely forward
as he spoke and for the hundredth time
his secretary admired the courage and
resolution which were such marked char-
acteristics of this unimaginative man

  we seek an audience with the prince
ibn zodh sir hugh addressed one of
the wooden-faced guards the latter
looked rather like two figures from a
the altar of melek taos



childs noahs ark as they stood in their
long straight black tunics and tightly
bound red turbans both guards shook
their heads solemnly and gazed past the
two visitors to the parched heights be-
yond

  we would speak with the high priest
in the name of melek taos we crave
admittance hadurs tone was com-
manding

  the faces of the two guards instantly
altered to alert wariness

  the password they said in unison

  phlagus schiekron and aclahayr
genii of the fourth hour replied hadur

  the two guards saluted humbly and
stood aside

  enter masters of the hour the way
lies open

  silencing sir hugh with a warning
look hadur led the way into a great
courtyard murmuring as they left the
guards behind

  leave it to me now i have learned
enough to get us inside the palace after
that-

the courtyard was a rectangular en-
closure its towering walls shutting
out every gleam of sun a single low
squat doorway broke the dark polished
surfaces that closed them in over which
a figure stood out in bas-relief-the figure
of a bird from whose head bright dart-
ing flames shot upward it was a replica
of the winged bird which evadne bore
on her hand and sir hugh recognized it
with a shudder of disgust

  two more guards stood here and chal-
lenged hadur promptly

  the black sword of gaffarel watch-
er in the house of mercury he replied

  pass magi diviners of the great mys-
tery

  sir hugh followed his secretary with
a rising anger he loathed all this mum-

mery the darkness the half-seen kabal-
istic lettering on the walls the exchange
of meaningless words at every entrance
door the air of mystery that the unusual
surroundings provoked he realized that
his mind was succumbing despite his
will to a sense of fear and foreboding
and his sturdy common sense rebelled at
such impositions on it

  hadur turned to see the impatient an-
ger in his eyes

  remember he warned in a whisper
the sitt evadne is helpless here we are
all she has to help her now do not let
your anger betray you

  from one vaulted chamber to another
they passed at each came the challenge
and hadurs quietly assured answer to it
the winged bird met their eyes on every
hand in some form or another-on the
robes of the sphinx-like guards in flam-
ing iridescent colors on the dull smooth
blackness of the walls in the form of
hanging lamps in which dancing flames
moved ceaselessly in the gloom or poised
over altars on which long tongues of fire
writhed like serpents in the shadow of
deep-cut archways

  its getting infernally hot muttered
sir hugh as they penetrated still further
into the interior of the great palace and
is it my imagination or do you hear that
strange hissing sound its been getting
steadily louder and louder

  we are close to the audience cham-
ber from what my friend told me this
is the hour for the ritual dance and
youll understand the heat and the sound
in a few minutes

  the noise increased to a humming
roar as they passed another entrance
hadur under pretense of stooping to ad-
mire an immense glittering presentment
of melek taos wrought in crystal and
holding a great ball of fire in its beak
spoke rapidly to his companion


weird tales

  the prince will bait us be prepared
to hear and see anything-anything but
keep silent watch closely and do not be
betrayed into passion

  at the last doorway no guards stood
but across the threshold hung a moving
curtain of fire and cloud hadur walked
straight forward and sir hugh wrought
up to a pitch when he would have taken
pleasure in engaging a grizzly bear to
single combat flung himself across the
fire-mist without a pause

  a loud purring hum of fire greeted
them and in the first moment they
thought the vaulted room in which they
stood was going up in flames as their
eyes grew accustomed to the glare they
saw that the tall branching pillars of fire
that swept across the length and breadth
of the vast room did not touch the gleam-
ing inlaid floor but played in the air in a
sort of fantastic weaving dance

  as they saw the meaning and purpose
of the fire they drew back in sick incredu-
lous horror

  between the tall flames like moths
blown by a sirocco a nude capering
crowd ran frantically to and fro striving
with unearthly yells to escape the torture
of the licking flames gaunt deformed
inhuman objects scarred and withered to
the bone they were the ceremonial danc-
ers preserved from death by the magic
of the very power which tormented them
she is there-the sitt evadne
hadur more prepared for the unparal-
leled horrors of the princes stronghold
pointed to a massive platform against the
wall to their right

  sir hugh turned to see her seated be-
side the high priest her eyes fixed in a
blank stare on the capering figures below
her vainly he looked for some means
of reaching her but the platform was
high and smoothly polished to its base
and no steps led to it from the floor

   evadne he called standing directly
beneath her evadne

   the love and despair in his voicewould
have summoned her from the last dim
portals of death itself it summoned her
now she stood up her eyes grave and
intent

  who calls me her words came
softly perplexed oh-who calls

   sir hughs very soul stood in his eyes
as he looked up into her bewildered face

   evadne darling it is hugh hugh

 your husband come back to me evadne
come back to me

   the frozen bewilderment broke upher
eyes met his with a sudden tragic aware-
ness

  hugh hugh save me something
   holds me hugh  my darling
prince dena rose and put a hand on
her arm instantly all the quick color
faded from her face and she turned with
the old dreaming adoration to the prince

   we welcome you to our palace sir
hugh willett the high priest bowed
mockingly evadnes hand clasped in his
own tonight we hold the feast of
sacrifice tonight we celebrate my union
with this woman whom melek taos has
seen fit to bestow on me his devoted ser-
vant never has it been my lot to hold
such golden loveliness in my arms be-
fore

sir hugh strove to speak to move to
curse that smiling wonderfully chis-
elled face that looked down upon him
the roaring increased in his ears the
bright flames seemed to dance toward him
then at a sign from their master they
receded suddenly like a tide ebbing and
the taunting voice of his enemy came clear
through the mist and confusion

   not yet not yet my servants he
shall join in our feast tonight he shall
watch me woo this golden loveliness
the altar of melek taos



from his embrace he shall witness the
sacrifice at the rising of the new moon
and stand helpless o melek taos when
thou dost stoop from thy heaven to the
altar stoop to thy victim-the perfect
sacrifice which i will give thee at the
rising of the moon

  the tide of fire rolled back sweeping
with it those agonized shrieking figures
-back-back with an ever-diminishing
hum and crackle until the vast hall stood
empty the two on the platform van-
ished also leaving sir hugh shaking in
every limb leaning on hadur with eyes
staring wildly at the deserted thrones of
ebony above him

  gone with him-with him

  suddenly he made a dash to the arched
doorway by which he had entered but as
he neared the fire-mist a flame shot out
and curled about him like a serpent
scorching and blackening his face and
hands

  staggering back he looked around the
great empty hall and discovered other
archways set in every wall between broad
pillars on which the signs of the zodiac
gleamed in red and gold no doors
barred these open arches no guards stood
before them no curtain of fire and cloud
hung over them

  yet sir hugh could not pass them

  blind with grief and rage reckless as
a wounded jungle beast he assaulted each
empty threshold in turn from each he
was hurled back by some violent force
that sent him reeling and spinning across
the floor only to rise and dash blindly at
another entrance

  hadur watched him with tears at
last his brief madness of despair over
and convinced that he was indeed a pris-
oner he turned to the faithful arab and
sat down beside him with his head be-
tween his hands

  arfi all is not yet lost do not give

way to utter despair while the sitt evadne
is still safe allah is merciful and may
even yet restore her to thee

  evadne safe with him

  safe until the rising of the moon
declared hadur that much i have
learned from the father whose daughter
was a bride of melek taos

  safe-with that hell-fiend all the
long hours of this day

  arfi i swear by allah and by the
life of this body that the high priest
will not touch her until tonight he
dares not there are laws even a false
magus may not break unless he desires
instant annihilation for many days be-
fore the sacrifice the high priest must
prepare himself and abstain from many
things the lips of the destined bride
are one of these things taboo until to-
night she is safe

  the other merely groaned

  it is the truth repeated hadur the
high priest may not drink of his cup of
love until the destined hour it is a cere-
mony of mystic union in which the angel
peacock shares even prince dena dare
not insult his god

  sir hugh bowed his head to his hands
again and hadurs eyes mirrored his own
agony as he stared bleakly before him

  ya habiby he murmured under his
breath ah my beloved cursed be he
who hath set this darkness in thy path
may the devils he serves rend his soul
from his body and send it shrieking down
to hell wa hyat rukbaty i will follow
him to the deepest pit of gehenna if he
brings that youth and beauty to the dust
allah be my witness allah hear me
give strength to thy servant hear me
hear me thou just and compassionate
one

  he sat very still striving to master the
tide of love and agony that overwhelmed


weird tales

him striving to find a gleam of hope in
the darkness

	the altar of melek taos

as sardanapalus king of babylon

l	had feasted with his magi and
women and favorites and all the syco-
phants of a fabulously wealthy court so
did the prince dena ibn zodh in his
black and scarlet robes of ceremony sit
with evadne at his side on the night of
sacrifice

   wild beasts controlled by the magnet-
ic power of the magi rolled in luxurious
ease on silken rugs the great tables
gleamed with jewelled goblets and golden
dishes a thousand instruments mingled
with the clamor of a thousand tongues
waves of intoxicating perfumes were
wafted up from vaults beneath the palace
myriads of lamps winked and blazed
from roof and walls and pillars at in-
tervals a dancer would float out on to the
great white marble circle of floor round
which the tables were grouped veiled
only in her cloud of hair and moving
like a blown leaf before the wind would
draw an outburst of applause that set
the great beasts roaring until the domed
hall rang

   vast sinister marvellous as the dreams
of a hashish-eater the long orgy at last
drew to an end the revellers lay back
amidst their cushions while prince dena
rose from his place and led evadne to
the center of the enclosed circle 

  he held up a hand and silence fell
over the entire multitude of feasters not
even a beast but seemed suddenly turned
to a lifeless statue

  sir hugh willett and hadur who had
sat watchful and silent during the long
revel eating only enough to give them
strength and drinking no wine looked
up with tightening nerves as the destined
bride stood facing the vast assembly

  a single garment of marvellously-
wrought gold tissue outlined her lovely
slenderness her shining head was bound
with a richly jewelled circlet of gold
and over her eyes its clasp glittered bright
and evil in the myriads of lamps so
brilliant were the gems that formed this
clasp that it had all the effect of a living
flame and sir hugh shuddered as he saw
the hateful familiar symbol of melek
taos flash and flash again above evadnes
dreaming misted eyes

  the hour is at hand the high
priests ringing tones pierced even the

wine-sodden senses of the revellers this

                                                              i

is my hour my hour of love my hour
of fulfilment the hour of mystic com-
munion with melek taos when he in
me and i in him rejoice in the bride

  follow he continued turning his
burning gaze around the entire circle
follow that you may worship at the
great altar of melek taos that you may
see the angel peacock descend in living
fire-awful transcendent inexplicable
follow the hour is come

  not yet not yet whispered hadur
in anguished appeal as his companion
gathered himself up for attack you
may destroy her body and soul if you
strike too soon it must be done before
the altar

  but crazed with the torture of long
imaginings sir hugh was deaf to hadurs
pleading he snatched up a long curved
knife from a table and rushed across the
marble floor with a swift silent ferocity
that came within an ace of success a
black panther however lolling at ease
within that circle saw the flying figure
and sprang like an arrow from a mighty
bow man and beast together rolled at
the feet of the high priest gleaming
fang and gleaming knife matched in a
death struggle

  the high priest smiled evadne stared
the altar of melek taos



with a heart-breaking blankness in her
eyes the revellers stood up cheering
and laughing the other beasts drew
near their heads flattened their tails
switching slowly there was a fierce pro-
longed snarl a choking cough and the
panther suddenly lay very still a pool of
blood spreading over the white marble
floor

  sir hugh staggered to his feet and
advanced with his dripping knife still
clasped in one shaking hand his eyes
on his dreaming spellbound wife the
high priest smiled again stretching out
one jewelled forefinger toward the dis-
hevelled figure

  instantly the lamp-flames from end to
end of that vast room flared up to the
very roof a peal of thunder shook the
crystal goblets and golden dishes from
the tables the beasts cowered in abject
terror and sir hugh as if struck by some
terrible force was sent hurtling and
crashing across the floor to hadurs side
where he lay limp as a half-emptied sack
of meal

  with loud drunken laughter the feast-
ers turned to follow prince dena in his
black and scarlet robes with a five-
pointed star-the seal of solomon-fas-
tened in the silken folds of his turban
and the symbol of melek taos in rubies
on his breast

  hadur half carried half dragged the
semi-conscious sir hugh after the laugh-
ing intoxicated crowd down endless
corridors and flights of steps they went
until they reached the great vaulted
chambers beneath the palace and thence
a subterranean passage cut from the solid
rock led to the immense vaults beneath
the temple from one cave-like chamber
to another the high priest led the silent
lovely bride

  the cooler air revived sir hugh he

leaned less heavily on hadur and breathed
more easily

  where is she where is she he
asked hoarsely

  there walking ahead of us

  the prince was leading evadne up a
long flight of steps the crowd at their
heels hadur and sir hugh now almost
himself again began to push through
the drunken indifferent mob they were
not far from the leaders of it when a
brilliant light broke up the vaulted dark-
ness and hadur whispered

  the red altar of melek taos

  they had arrived at the top of the
steps where a row of huge squat pillars
stood outlined against a crimson glare
from within the two passed between
the pillars and found themselves in a co-
lossal underground chapel whose walls
and floor and roof gleamed in brilliant
fiery scarlet after the long dark pas-
sages with their few lamps it was some
minutes before they could get a clear im-
pression of their surroundings

  pillars ran along three sides of the
chapel with torches fastened to them in
the fourth wall an immense shrine was
hollowed out running deeply back and
sunk in a semi-circular basin below the
level of the floor in the center of the
shrine stood a figure of some insoluble
glittering metal half man half bird its
head crowned its wings outspread and
curved before its body its hands and
arms were human its legs scaled and end-
ing in monstrous daws

  from the hollowed base on every side
of the figure rose luminous blue-tipped
fire with the roar of many waters the
incandescent sheets of flame stretched up
to lick the lofty roof it burned with the
hum and fierce song of ageless strength
and mystery-unapproachable irresisti-
ble unconquerable fire


weird tales

the prince looked at the bride he
had brought to the sacrifice-the
proud shining head the marvellous ten-
der beauty of eyes and molded lips the
slender matchless symmetry of limbs and
body but above all the spark in her of
that divine fire that did not fail or die
before the source of its inspiration never
before had the high priest brought a
bride to the altar of melek taos without
seeing her beauty dwindle and become as
insignificant as that of a mere painted
doll

  his breath quickened he watched
her fascinated unbelieving incredulous
that any woman could stand in the terri-
ble brilliance of that borrowed fire from
heaven and draw from it an added glory
to herself he stepped back to watch
her to engrave on his memory the image
of this perfect bride before he broke the
lovely mold and offered it here on the
great altar

  the roystering mob was awed by the
sublime spectacle before them they
drew back toward the walls back from
that unleashed quivering force the naked
pure element from which all life sprang
and to which all life must finally return
they blinked afraid ashamed knowing
themselves for beasts and less than beasts
before that clean and living flame

  evadne stood silent and enthralled by
the edge of the fountain of fire by her
side prince dena waited enthralled also
by the unexpected sublimity of this hour
of love the radiant figure of the golden
bride appearing as the very spirit of the
fire itself a passion of desire rose in
him as swift as fierce as all-devouring
as the lightnings that he gathered in the
hollow of his hand

  for the first time he regretted the ex-
igencies of his office as high priest and
the necessity of yielding up that fair and

lovely body to the fiery embrace of melek
taos after his one brief hour of love

  he made an impatient gesture to his
magi as a sign that they should perform
their usual duties they made the seven-
fold obeisance and moved about the
chapel to extinguish the torches and spread
a thick carpet of crimson rose petals be-
fore the altar the prince stood with
eyes on evadne oblivious to the rest

  sir hugh and hadur edged nearer and
nearer to the altar no one prevented
them or noticed them at all and they
bided their time watchfully hadur
whispered low and earnestly to his com-
panion under cover of the deep humming
song of the fire and the latter listened
with a faint gleam of hope in his eyes
he did not understand the full extent of
the plan suggested he did not realize
what hadurs re was to be nor did
hadur mean him to understand

  to save evadne was the one thought
that dominated them both sir hugh
was in no state of mind to worry about
details there seemed a last chance-he
would take it

  el mektoub mektoub murmured
hadur to himself and watched evadne
with eyes that took a long farewell

prince dena advanced to the altar
leading evadne by the hand and
standing before the fire-encircled image
of melek taos he cried

  o master behold the bride

  the fire sank down to the floor at his
clarion call seeming to abase itself at the
feet of the great magus who could com-
mand it

o mighty one o melek taos o ruler of
  earth

bend from thy throne to accept this sacrifice

in mystic communion do thou live in me as i
   in thee

the hour is mine the hour is thine

the joy is mine the joy is thine

be that which thou art and thou shalt be

cover me with the splendor of eloim and ischim
the altar of melek taos



by the very voice of fire i hail thee bright

   spirit

melek taos melek taos melek taos elvay

  at the last word the fire sprang fiercer
and brighter than before the hum of
the flames became a triumphant song

  the high priest turned his back to the
altar and faced the people

  open the doors o magi and ye
worshippers - at the shrine depart and
leave me to my hour when that is
passed-the voice of prince dena sank
to its deepest note his burning eyes veiled
for a moment by their heavy lids-then
ye shall return to witness the sacrifice in
the name of melek taos i bid thee go

  hadur and sir hugh were now very
close to the altar they stood tensed in
every muscle while the crowd about them
streamed toward the open doors

  the high priest stood with eyes on
evadne enchanted utterly oblivious to all
else he took one step toward her it
was his last

  he never knew who seized him in arms
of steel hurling him back to that sea of
living flame over the edge of the sunken
altar into the heart of the singing incan-
descent fire

  a long shivering moan rose from the
people as hadur with prince dena in
his arms rolled over into the triumphant
leaping flames for a brief moment a
blinding glare filled the cavernous chapel
to its farthermost corner as the fire curled

and roared over its two victims turning
them to mere blackened shells in a few
awful moments total darkness followed
not a flicker not a vestige of the altar
fire lit the gloom

  stumbling forward with a great cry
sir hugh found evadne clinging to him
crying trembling broken helpless as a
child taking her in his arms he stag-
gered on blindly cries and groans
sounded on every hand

  how he found the entrance he never
knew but he reached it at last and fol-
lowed the subterranean passages where
not one single lamp gleamed now until
a draft of fresher air guided him to a
door opening on the courtyard of the
palace

  the place was desolate and silent the
guards on this night of feasting lay in
drunken sleep across the threshold of the
gates

  down the cliff path the fugitives stum-
bled and found the car still standing in
the valley to his intense relief and sur-
prize sir hugh found it answered to bis
touch and they reached port said safely
a few days later

  they never returned to the east
evadnes vague memories and sir hughs
vivid ones as well as their sorrow for
hadurs death robbed the orient of all
its color and romance for both of them
for ever

by harold ward

a shuddery story about an electrocuted murderer who was raised
from the dead and revivified

the condemned man raised his
bloodshot eyes and glared at the
newcomer angrily

  you another lousy preacher he
snarled get the hell out of here
better come outside sir and talk to
him through the bars the guard whis-
pered hes bad

  the fat man silenced him with a ges-
ture

  ive something for mr fishers ear
alone he answered calmly then as
the guard closed the cell door and stepped
back out of hearing no fisher im
not a preacher i care not a tinkers damn
about the condition of your soul it is
your body that i want his voice dropped
to a husky whisper they are going to
burn you in the morning theyll fry
you until your insides shrivel up like

bacon in a pan theyll-

  the murderers fingers stubby gnarled
twisted and untwisted like a den of snakes

  i could choke hell out of you before
the screws could get to you he said
speculatively ive a notion to try it
fat men are easy to kill they havent

any wind and-

  the newcomer shrugged his shoulders
we havent time to argue the mat-
ter he smiled stroking his long white
beard he spoke with just a trace of
german accent we will assume that
you are correct in your statement he
went on now give me five minutes to
tell you my story

  he leaned forward so that his voice
would not carry outside the cell

     

  i can save you man there is one
chance in a million for you to cheat death
one chance in a million to keep that soul
of yours out of hells fire do you want
to take that chance or do you intend let-
ting the law take its course

  fisher raised his matted head

  say bo are you tryin to kid me
he growled he pounded his thick chest
like a gorilla im bad i am i-but
whats the proposition

  the fat man chuckled he leaned for-
ward again and tapped the others knee
with his pudgy forefinger

  just this he whispered as i told
you a moment ago they will shoot three
jolts of electricity into you in the morn-
ing everything thats inside of you will
be burned to a crisp-heart liver lungs
intestines-everything im a doctor i
know im an experimenter-a scientist
my colleagues at the university where i
once taught claimed that i was crazy-
crazy because i dared think in advance
of the times manys the time i have seen
them tap their brows when they thought
my head was turned now heres the
proposition in a nutshell i want your
body you can sign a paper that ive
prepared instructing the authorities to
give it to me after they have wreaked their
vengeance on you you have no relatives
to put in a prior claim if i can get you
before rigor mortis sets in i believe-
believe i say for i do not want to de-
ceive you-that i can by grafting within
your body the viscera of one of the lower
animals-a dog for instance--bring you
the ravening monster



back to life again the chance is as i
told you one in a million that i will suc-
ceed but you can afford to take that
chance for you will be dead in any event
-so dead that the maggots will be crawl-
ing between your ribs within a month

  he chuckled huskily to himself the
murderer shrank back against the wall

  shut up damn you he growled im
human i am even if i am a damned
killer

  the fat man chuckled again

  i thought that remark about the mag-
gots would put some life into you he
answered thats what they call psy-
chology my friend as for you being
a human being i doubt it the papers
refer to you as the beast because of
your brutality youve wallowed in blood
-innocent blood youve killed because
you like to see people suffer-just as a
bad boy tortures a butterfly by sticking
pins into it you like to see people twist
and squirm and writhe under your cruel
grasp you love the smell of rich fresh
blood you are an atavism-a reversion
to some prehistoric type all in all you

are the most brutal killer in the history
of crime-

  the condemned man squared his shoul-
ders proudly

  thats me he chortled ive made
a name for myself-a name that people
wont forget for a while did you see
what the papers wrote about me they
said that i-

  the fat man stopped him with a ges-
ture

  my name is kritz he interrupted
ive got a dog that ive been working
with hes ready for the experiment he
is the same sort of dog that you are a man
he too is a throwback-a wolf-dog-a
wild animal with slavering jaws and
greenish-yellow bloodshot eyes hes an
outcast among dogs feared and hated by
all of his kind even his ancestors the
wolves would have nothing to do with
him in the days when he ran wild hes
a killer too-the sort of killer that sneaks
up from behind and strikes without warn-
ing its his viscera that i intend to graft
into your body if i succeed i-

he threw up his arm and his finger involun-
tarily pressed the trigger

  he stopped suddenly and leaning for-
ward dropped his voice even lower than
before

  if i succeed you can kill again he
whispered you can satiate yourself with
blood-wallow in it-wade in it up to
your ankles no one will be the wiser
for fisher the murderer will be dead
see in his place will be a new man
but come the guard grows uneasy what
do you say

  the killers eyes were gleaming bale-
fully they were the eyes of a man who
has been drugged his face twisted and
writhed his teeth gnashed together like
those of a wild animal his voice trem-
bled as he stretched forth his hand

  blood blood he whispered half
to himself the chance to kill again
the chance to feel warm flesh beneath
my fingers once more and hear the gur-
gle of the dying give me the paper
man call in a couple of screws to wit-
ness it when i sign and then-then get
out get out before i choke you i-
god god how i love blood



dawn a small whitewashed room
bare save for the curiously con-
structed chair with innumerable straps
and wires attached which stood on a
slightly raised platform in the center of
the floor and the dozen rude benches sur-
rounding it on them sat men conversing
in low whispers

  the poor devil dont even know his
own name one of the newspaper men
whispered to the man at his side they
say that he was conked by a bit of shrap-
nel over in france been balmy ever since
but nobody knows for certain somebody
called him john fisher and the name
stuck

  he sure as thunder is a bloodthirsty
wretch the other answered i covered

that story of his capture he cleaned up
on two coppers when the posse cornered
him in the cornfield after hed killed old
man dickinson and his wife with a hatch-
et hes a mental case government
ought to take care of him

  cant prove service connection no-
body to front for him at the veterans
bureau cheaper a damn sight for the
state to fry him than stick him into the

nut-house he-

  the entrance of the warden brought
conversation to a sudden stop

  the official held up his hand protest-
ingly

  please stop smoking gentlemen re-
member you are here to witness an exe-
cution not a theatrical performance a
man is about to meet his maker
somebody tittered he stopped sud-
denly as the door opened again and the
condemned man was brought in there
was a dazed look on his wolfish face on
either side walked a guard a black-
robed priest walked ahead of him chant-
ing a paternoster from a black-bound
book

  he snarled like a caged animal as they
shoved him into the chair and commenced
adjusting the straps leaning forward
he sank his teeth into the hand of one of
the guards the man jerked away with
a muttered oath a newspaper man gig-
gled the warden frowned

  the guards stepped back with a slight
nod to the warden he held up his hand
the witnesses leaned forward the man
in the chair strained jerkily at his bonds
then dropped back there was a slight
smell of burning flesh   



dawn again in a huge room in a
great ramshackle house set in the
midst of a dark forest a white-aproned
pot-bellied man with long white whis-
the ravening monster



kers worked feverishly over an operating-
table the odor of carbolic acid and dis-
infectants filled the air

  the old man straightened his tired
back and laying a brightly polished in-
strument upon the porcelain-topped table
beside him turned to the girl who was
acting as his assistant

  we win greta my daughter he
cried exultingly removing his rubber
gloves and throwing them atop the table
he will live

   the girl dropped into a chair her face
white and drawn

  god father but im tired she ex-
claimed eighteen hours without food
or water and even if we have won what
does it all amount to

  the old mans eyes burned with a
fanatical light

  my colleagues at the university-they
called me crazy he snarled crazy-
me alexander kritz-because i dared
to think in advance of them this man
will prove to them whether or not i am
insane but no-i can not proclaim my
story to the world because he is a crim-
inal in bringing him back to life we
have helped cheat the law therefore
we might be forced to pay the penalty
but my girl we have the satisfaction of
knowing that we have done that which
no other human has ever done before
the organism of the dog still palpitates
with life-throbs within the body of the
man absolute quiet for weeks until
every union has grown together think
of it soon the rich warm blood will be
pulsating through the veins again-the
veins that the law destroyed think of
it girl think of it the dead will
walk again

  he dropped into a chair beside the
one occupied by his daughter and closed
his weary eyes



the rain was coming down in tor-
rents ted tucker attorney at law
glanced down at his gas gage and turned
the car in to a filling-station at the out-
skirts of the village the attendant clad
in slicker and high rubber boots gave
him such attention as he required

  hell of a night the native remarked
as he rubbed a chamois skin over the
windshield goin far

  the lawyer shrugged his shoulders
ill tell you when youve told me
something he answered where does
professor alexander kritz live i under-
stand that its somewhere close by

  the attendant looked at him queerly
for an instant he made no reply as he
slowly counted out the change for a two-
dollar bill and passed it back to the other

  you a friend of his he demanded
a peculiar expression creeping over his
weather-beaten face

  hardly that the lawyer answered
im his attorney

  oh the attendant grunted leaning
his arm atop the open window peculiar
old cuss aint he

  tucker shook his head

  ive never met him he answered
what sort of man is he

   the native hesitated

  folks hereabouts dont like him he
said finally no one ever goes there
when he first arrived he made it known
that he didnt want company comes in
to town occasionally to buy his grub
pays cash for it and goes on about his
business the girls just as bad shes a
pretty little thing and shes got a nice
car-buys gas here occasionally-but
when some of the boys tried to shine up
to her she cut em cold they say that
theyve got a half-wit livin there too
maybe hes a relative and theyre sort of
shamed of him they live in the old


weird tales

priestly house a couple of miles back in
the woods foller the pavement straight
ahead till you hit a road leadin in
through the woods-graveled take it
till you come to a road to die right
taint much of a road but you can get
through it with the power youve got it
leads right up to the house its a big
tumbledown affair

  the lawyer nodded and pressed his
foot against the starter the attendant
stepped back as if to close the conversa-
tion then as if struck by a thought he
stepped forward again

  theres been a lot of peculiar carry-
ings-on hereabouts he said soberly
youre a stranger so id best warn you
jim peasley was killed a while back-
throat ripped all to the devil like a wild
beast had done it few nights later lizzie
mumsley ol miss dixons hired girl
she got it the same way throat chawed
and torn sheriff had a posse searchin
around but they havent found nothing
lot of stock killed too better watch
your step mister

  he stuck his head in through the open
window of the car and lowered his voice

  a lot of folks blame kritz although
i dont see what hes got to do with it
but people will talk you know

  tucker displayed the handle of a re-
volver stuck in -the side pocket of his
raincoat

  im from chicago he bragged
in there we have guns to cut our teeth
on when we are babies even the nurs-
ing-bottles are made to look like machine-
guns i can take care of myself but
thanks just the same

  the station attendant shrugged his
shoulders and turned back into the
warmth and security of his little station

the lights of the machine brought
out a side road leading off from the
pavement tucker slowed down grav-

eled though it was it looked little bet-
ter than a track rambling through the
foliage of two hills he turned onto it
the headlights showed up every hole in
the gravel every tiny pond of water
every shadowy stone making them look
more dangerous than they really were
the lightning flashed incessantly inter-
mingled with the steady rumble of thun-
der in spite of the windshield-wiper he
was forced to travel at a snails pace

  ahead of him was the wood the
jagged flashes of lightning which con-
stantly split the sky brought out every
tree and bush in bold relief the head-
lights showed the side road turning off
from the graveled thoroughfare he
cautiously turned his machine onto it it
was muddy and rough but as the oil
station attendant had said he negotiated
it with little trouble although he little
more than crept along

  the storm was increasing in fury every
minute the rattle of the rain upon the
top of the car and the steady rumble of
the thunder made a medley of sound in
which the exhaust of his engine took no
small part the temperature was drop-
ping steadily he recollected too late
that the heater was disconnected he
was benumbed-half frozen

  the lane-it was little more than a
tunnel through the trees so heavy was
the foliage-twisted sharply to the left
ahead of him loomed a huge pile of
masonry the headlights played over the
wet vine-covered stone it looked like
an old world castle one window only
showed a light it was dim and blurred
as if the shade had been pulled tightly
against the flash	 -

  he turned his spotlight against the
door finally he located it-a huge
affair of dark wood at the end of a flag-
stone path edged with bushes and weeds
the whole place seen through the dark-
ness and rain had a distinct air of bleak-

                     w t -
the ravening monster



ness and inhospitality he put it down
to the storm and climbing stiffly out of
the car faced the fury of the elements
outside the car he found the tumult
was worse than he had expected the
force of the wind fairly lifted him off his
feet the night was filled with the con-
stant rumble of the thunder and the
roar of the breeze through the trees com-
bined with the ceaseless downpour of
the rain the sky was torn by incessant
flashes of lightning in spite of the
raincoat he was soaked by the time he
negotiated the narrow path to the door

  a man leaped out of the shadow of
the bushes and cautiously approached
he was almost upon the lawyer the lat-
ter caught a glimpse of him as an un-
usually bright stroke of lightning split
the heavens-a glimpse of a hairy face
of gleaming bloodshot eyes of lips
drawn back over gleaming teeth in a
wolfish snarl

 are you-

  the man leaped back an instant later
he was swallowed up by the blackness of
the forest



tucker shuddered turning he
brought his knuckles against the
panel there was no answer cursing
under his breath he beat his fist against
the wood agairf and again from inside
came a peculiar clcmp-clomp-clomp
suddenly it ceased he could feel-
actually feel-that some one was stand-
ing on the other side of the door listen-
ing angrily he brought his knuckles
against the door again

  who is it a quavering voice de-
manded it was not the palsied quaver
of an old person but rather the trem-
bling voice of some one in mortal terror

  tucker he answered above the
crash and tumult of the storm is this
w t-

the residence of professor alexander

kritz

  for a moment there was no reply
then a chain rattled and a bolt was
drawn from its hasp the door was
pulled back a tiny crack and an eye
peered through the opening

  who did you say it was the fear-
laden voice demanded again

  tucker the lawyer roared thorough-
ly angry by this time if you are profes-
sor kritz then i am the lawyer you tele-
graphed for this morning i am a mem-
ber of the firm of tucker and wakeman
my partner mr wakeman was unable
to come if you are not professor kritz
then i will be on my way and to hell
with you i dont intend to stand out
here in this storm all night debating the
question

  the man on the other side muttered
something then the door was slowly
drawn back far enough for the visitor to
squeeze through the opening only to be
slammed shut again with force enough
to jar the house the bolt was slipped
back into its hasp and the chain snapped
into place the lawyer brushed the water
from his eyes and stood staring at a fat
man dressed in an andent dressing-gown
-a man slightly past middle age with
long white whiskers and beady eyes that
blinked at him through thick-lensed
glasses he was walking on crutches
which accounted for the clomping sound
in his right hand he held a huge re-
volver with which he covered his visitor
threateningly balancing himself on the
crutches one foot held several inches
above the floor

  do you always receive your visitors
this way tucker demanded

  the fat man stuck the weapon into
the folds of his gown and extended a
hand for him to shake-a flabby fish-like
hand covered with red hair and stained
with chemicals


weird tales

  i must beg your pardon sir he said
finally gazing at the newcomer from
under his shaggy brows i-well to be
honest i had expected to see wakeman
and i-i am in danger here mortal
danger god alone knows what danger
i am in

  he hesitated then

  that is why i did not let you in im-
mediately he went on i am forced to
maintain a veritable fortress here

  the lawyer nodded comprehendingly
come to me at once the message had
said please do not delay it is a mat-
ter of life and death

  mr wakeman was taken suddenly
ill he answered soberly otherwise
he would have responded in person to
your wire in view of the fact that you
seemed in extreme haste he believed it
better to send me than to wait until he
was recovered

  kritz shrugged his fat shoulders turn-
ing he led the way down a narrow bare
hall lighted by a single kerosene bracket
lamp suddenly he stopped and turning
to the other dropped his voice to a husky
whisper

  did you see anything when you came
in he questioned or hear anything-
unusual

  the lawyer nodded briefly

  a man he dodged out of the bushes
at my approach for an instant i thought
that he meant to attack me or speak to
me then as i turned he dodged back
into the forest why i had heard that
you had a-well a man with you who

was slightly off and-

  kritz halted him with that peculiar
gesture of his

  never mind he said bruskly i
will explain later

  he led his visitor to a door and turn-
ing the knob ushered him inside tucker
rightly surmised that it was through the
window of this room that the light had

filtered for a huge desk lamp illuminat-
ed all of the vast interior a partition
wall had been torn out between two large
rooms the result being a vast space
filled almost to overflowing with books
and laboratory apparatus the walls were
lined with heavy tomes in a distant cor-
ner was a sink in front of which stood a
porcelain-topped table several shelves
were laden with bottles and retorts and
other chemical paraphernalia

tucker removed his sodden coat and
hat at a sign from kritz and threw
them across a chair indicating another
the fat man motioned his visitor to be
seated he was about to seat himself on
the other side of the desk when he sud-
denly recollected himself

  in my excitement i forget my duties
as host he apologized you have not
yet dined

  the lawyer shook his head

  i did not stop because of he storm
he answered

  kritz picked up his crutches and started
toward the door

  your pardon sir he exclaimed i
will summon greta my daughter and
ask her to prepare a lunch and some hot
coffee you will need it after your soak-
ing we live alone greta and i because
of the confidential nature of my experi-
ments she is my assistant

  he hobbled another step toward the
door then stopped again

  one question he said suddenly it
is a question which may require some
thought on your part before it is an-
swered-and it is necessary that it be an-
swered immediately i know little or
nothing of the laws of your country
what is the penalty for bringing a man
back from the grave-a man who has
been killed by the law-executed
tucker stared at him blankly
the ravening monster



  -i dont believe that i quite under-
stand you he said finally

  suppose that i create a man-sup-
pose that i take a dead body after the
law has wreaked its vengeance upon it
and into that bit of cold clay i again
place life suppose that i find that
i have created a frankenstein monster
-a menace to society have i the
right as its creator to kill it or must
i turn it over to the law once more
and if i do turn it over to the law
what is the penalty i must pay for thwart-
ing the laws vengeance

  the lawyer scratched his head dumbly
was the man insane no sane man
would ask such a question

  your question is more for a priest
than for a lawyer he answered to gain
time on the other hand-

  he stopped suddenly from outside
the window came a peculiar scratching
sound it was like that of a cat clawing
against the side of the house or sharpen-
ing its claws on the soft pine sash

  kritz jerked the revolver from his
pocket and cocked it his hand trembling
like a leaf in the wind

  there it is he whispered huskily
that is fisher-the beast-the thing
that i am talking about

  then came a howl-a long shrieking
quivering howl it was the howl of a
wolf that has scented fresh blood kritz
cowered against the wall his fat body
shaking like that of a man with the
palsy

  it ceased suddenly above the noise
and crash and tumult of the storm could
be heard the sound of running feet-of
unshod feet pad-pad-pad it rounded the

house

  a hand was laid softly on the door at
the end of the hall and the knob was
turned gently then came a puppyish
whine-the begging whine of a young

dog that has been locked out of its ac-
customed sleeping-place

   then all was silent again



for a moment neither man spoke the
old man had imparted some of his
terror to his visitor finally however he
straightened himself and shrugged his
shoulders although his teeth were still
chattering like castanets

  you-you understand-now he said
finally wiping the sweat from his fore-
head you have seen him and now you
-you have heard him its not like see-
ing an ordinary person theres-theres
a feeling about him-an undead feeling
if you understand what i mean it is
just lately that ive noticed him ive
never seen a ghost mr tucker as a
scientist ive always scouted the idea of
people coming back from the grave but
you get the same feeling from him that
i imagine one would get from meeting a
ghost-an unnatural feeling-a feeling
of terror

  and now he went on i will get
my daughter she will come down and
prepare something to eat i dared not
let her come downstairs before crippled
as i am and unable to defend her against
this awful thing i had a fall a few days
ago and strained the ligaments of my
leg

  the lawyer turned a white strained
face toward him

  sit down man he exclaimed sh
down and tell me about it what is this
terror-this thing that is holding you in
its grasp true i felt it but yet i do not
understand

   kritz dropped his trembling form into
a near-by chair

   thats the hell of it tucker he ex-
claimed i dont know when the idea
came to me i imagined that i was doing


weird tales

something wonderful for humanity-for
science think of it i said to myseif-if
i succeed there will be no need for death
one can keep going on and on and on
we worked greta and i until we were
ready to drop from exhaustion you have
heard of fisher the arch-murderer yes
well it was his body that i obtained from
the prison authorities he willed it to me
i promised to make him live again and
i kept my word into his empty shell i
grafted the viscera of a dog-the mean-
est lowest most vicious animal that i
could find-a canine fisher

  he stopped suddenly and leaning for-
ward tapped the others knee with his
forefinger his voice dropped to a hoarse
whisper

  kish the wolf-dog accursed of his
kind now lives within the body of john
fisher the murderer

  impossible tucker exclaimed

  is it kritz demanded you have
seen him you have heard him sniffing
at the window seeking to gain an en-
trance no tucker it is not impossible
i am a creator-as great as god himself
only just as god created in the devil a
thing that he was unable to control so
have i created this monster and he has
gotten beyond me

  for weeks after the operation of join-
ing the two bodies i kept him under the
influence of a powerful anesthetic of my
own compounding until every nerve and
muscle and tissue knit together into a
homogeneous whole heart lungs-
everything burned out by the powerful
electric current-were removed in their
place i grafted the organs of kish just
as burbank created his wonders of the
plant world so i created the wonder of
the animal kingdom-a living being
half man half dog

  my great problem was to keep him
quiet so that everything would knit to-
gether and at the same time keep dis-

solution from setting in that is why i
first compounded the anesthetic of which
i spoke and too i was obliged to use
artificial respiration it was not until two
months had passed that i dared allow
him to sit up and move of his own voli-
tion

  not until it was too late did i realize
what i had done he proved at the end
of the initial period to be nothing but a
mass of flesh and blood with apparently
no brain of course the electric current
destroyed his brain cells i attempted to
graft a bit of gray matter from the skull
of the dog onto his brain pan but appar-
ently without result yet there must have
been a few cells that lived since he talks
after a fashion and up to a certain point
is able to reason i proved one thing
conclusively his skull had at one time
been caved in there must have been a
pressure against his brain that was
probably what caused him to run amuck

  again he filled and lighted his long
german pipe tucker felt in his pocket
for a box of matches and a package of
cigarettes lighting one he leaned bade
in his chair and waited for the old man
to continue

  suddenly the pipe clattered to the
floor as kritz leaped to his feet and groped
once more among the folds of his gown
for the revolver

  listen he whispered hoarsely hear
him

  above the clamor and tumult of the
storm came that peculiar puppyish whine
again then the scratching at the win-
dow

  kritz automatically jerked the trigger
of his revolver the leaden slug embed-
ded itself harmlessly in the wall a foot to
one side of the window

  a bestial growl then the sound of
feet padding away in the distance

  a woman screamed

  father father my god what is it
the ravening monster



  the old man hobbled to the door

  he-he was at the window again
greta he called up the stairway have
no fear mr tucker is with me

turning back into the room he re-
seated himself and picked up the
pipe with trembling fingers

 this-this sluggish mass of meat that
i have stolen from the grave mr tucker
is-i hardly know how to describe him
to you he is neither man nor dog god
what ugly beasts they both were fisher
a bloodthirsty butcher a killer of the
worst criminal type a man devoid of
fear living only to shed blood even in
the death cell he cursed and raved like a
maniac when they went to lead him to
the chair he bit the hand of one of the
guards and shrieked with pleasure they
say at sight of the red blood once in
his cell he struck a priest who attempted
to console him he went to his death
with a vile oath on his lips and kish
the most vicious animal of the northland
hated by man and beast half wolf half
dog-a slinking killer   

  the union of the two of them is noth-
ing but an inert gob of fat and muscle
seemingly content to bask in the sun and
blink his heavy eyes when any one comes
near but you have heard my friend he
is not so dumb as he appears but i
digress

  he sucked meditatively at his pipe for
a moment before continuing

  two months ago he went on while
i was in the village buying supplies i
learned that one of the villagers had lost
a valuable calf he believed that a wild
dog was running amuck i paid little at-
tention to his tale

  then a dozen sheep were killed in a
near-by field next morning i noticed
blood on fishers hands and too there
was a peculiar muttony odor on his clothes
i questioned him but he only grinned

back at me idiotically exasperated i
seized a whip and beat him he merely
cowered in a corner and howled like a lit-
tle child i threw down the whip dis-
gusted at myself it was asinine to think
that this brainless monstrosity had killed
those animals he was as dumb and
harmless as a sheep himself yet the
blood-it made me think

  next a man was killed his body
was torn to bits and his throat cut and
slashed the farmers searched the coun-
tryside for traces of a wild animal-
some ferocious beast that was doing the
killing they found nothing

  but listen my friend next morning
when i went to the bowl to wash i found
traces of blood on the sides fisher had
learned his lesson he was crafty the
beating i had given him when i found
blood on his hands had taught him the
lesson of cunning

  i beat him again i whipped him un-
til the gore dripped in streams from the
cuts across his back he made no effort
to fight back i was still his master see
he had not yet learned that i was weaker
than he that is true with all of the lower
animals in his half-witted way he tried
to tell me that he had done nothing
wrong again i was almost tempted to
believe him-to believe that he was the
victim of some strange chain of circum-
stances for it is difficult my friend to
conceive such a thing-an inert sluggish
mass of flesh and blood-a thing ap-
parently contented to sit and stare aim-
lessly into vacancy-to believe that such
a thing can be so clever-so diabolically
cunning

  had i forgotten his record you ask
no but remember tucker that fisher
the arch-murderer vas dead-electro-
cuted out of his body and that of kish
the wolf-dog i had created this mon-
strosity i had expected something dif-
ferent and like all experimenters when


weird tales

an experiment turns out to be a failure i
threw the result aside fisher was a dif-
ferent sort of man from this thing-a
wild animal ferocious a devil incarnate
kish was of the same type only there
was a subtle streak in him this thing
of my creation had none of the character-
istics of either no i could not believe
that this stupid mass even though a com-
bination of the two could be the soft-
footed quick-striking thing that was ter-
rorizing the countryside

  again he smoked a moment in silence
then

  it was the calendar that revealed the
truth to me one day i glanced at it idly
the thought flashed across my brain that
the night the man was killed the moon
had been dark the night the sheep were
killed there was no moon the same thing
was true the night the calf was slashed
and tom and mangled

  some atavistic streak in fisher-some
throwback in kish the wolf-dog-when
combined causes this thing i have created
to run to kill to destroy only when there
is no moon now do you understand
tucker leaned forward his face betray-
ing the interest he felt

  i think that i do he answered it

is your opinion then that-

  his cuff caught on the window-shade
the spring released shot the shade to
the roller

  pressed against the glass was a face-
the face of a monster dark hairy with
little eyes bloodshot and glaring the
thick lips drawn back over yellowish teeth
of enormous size it was the face of a fiend
out of hell the rain-soaked hair was
dripping and matted the nose was flat
the nostrils of extraordinary size

  the lawyer leaped to his feet with a
shriek he jerked at the gun in his pocket
and brought it to play on the window
but too late the thing had disappeared

again he heard the pad-pad-pad of feet
in the distance then the dismal wailing
wolf-like howl



kritz shaking like a wind-blown leaf
 was still sitting in his chair as tuck-
er stretching forth his arm drew the
shade down again	 

  god what a face he exclaimed
it was the face of a devil a gargoyle

a-a-

  he hesitated at a loss for words the
old man took the sentence out of his
mouth

  the face of a thing made by human
hands and not by the creator he said
solemnly stilling his chattering teeth for
an instant i am glad mr tucker that
you have seen him again the glimpse
you had of him when you entered gave
you no conception of what he is you
will understand my problem better now
remember too that there is no moon to-
night that and the darkness and the
storm is why he is-why he is as he is
tomorrow should the sun come out he
may be altogether different-a listless
thing of almost inanimate flesh

  he picked up his pipe again and fill-
ing it stuffed the tobacco into the bowl
with his fat forefinger his eyes wearing
a strained far-away look finally light-
ing it he turned to the lawyer again

  since you have thus seen him i will
make the remainder of my story short
suffice to say that his next victim was an
innocent country girl they found her
mutilated body along the roadside i will
not go into the harrowing details again
it was in the dark of the moon resolved
to take no chances i had locked him up
but he broke down the door and made
his escape since then he has remained
outside the bit of brain inside his head
tells him that he has done wrong time
after time i have caught him prowling
the ravening monster



about but the streak of diabolical cun-
ning in his makeup warns him that the
revolver with which i have armed myself
is dangerous and he takes no chances

  where does he hide i do not know
it is seldom that he shows himself in the
daytime i have been living in a torment
of fear not only for myself but also for
greta hurrying from one part of the
house to another i sprained my leg by
falling the injury made me more help-
less than ever

   i have had it in my mind to flee-to
take my daughter and hasten to a place
of safety for i am certain that he intends
to kill us both instinct tells him that i
have done him an injury in bringing him
back from the grave how do i know
this that i can not tell only i do know
it but is it right that i should go away
and leave the devilish thing free to prey
upon the unsuspecting country people
and i dare not tell them what and who
he is for fear of the punishment they will
mete out to me for bringing such a mon-
ster into their midst

  he stretched forth his hand appeal-
ingly

   i know so little of the law mr tuck-
er my entire life has been devoted to
scientific pursuits what can they do to
me for bringing this arch-fiend-this man
killed by the law of the land-back to
life

   tucker hesitated kritz waited an in-
stant then went on

   that is why i sent the wire to wake-
man he has always transacted my busi-
ness for me it was he who purchased
this tumbledown house for me in order
that i might carry on my experiments in
seclusion

   this morning a hunter passed through
the woods he had several dogs with
him fisher kept out of sight i took a
chance and opening the door hailed the

fellow i gave him a dollar and asked
him to send a message to wakeman he
looked at me queerly when he read what
i had written and acted as if he doubted
my sanity i forced a laugh and told him
that the message was in code-that the
words had no meaning to any one who
did not have the key he went on his
way apparently satisfied

  fisher came out of the bushes where
he had been hiding and started stalking
the man his teeth were bared and his
lips were flecked with foam i thought
for a moment that he was about to leap
upon the poor devil t was on the verge
of shouting a warning i had never seen
him-the beast-act that way in the day-
time before it was the blood lust i
imagine-or he was hungry i should
have told the hunter-called his atten-
tion to the thing that was sneaking up
behind him he would have shot in self-
defense and my problem would have
been solved but something held me
back then it was too late for the sight
of the dogs drove the devilish thing back
to cover and the hunter went on his way
without knowing the dreadful peril that
had threatened him

  he stopped again licking his parched
lips with his moist tongue

   i forget my duties as host he apolo-
gized i will call greta at once she will
make some coffee and arrange a lunch for
you it will do you good after the soak-
ing you have been through i will be
gone but a short time but i must remain
with her in the kitchen i-i dare not
leave her there alone

  he stopped suddenly from outside
came a shrieking laugh-a wild maniacal
howl of glee it rose above the noise and
tumult of the storm ending in a wild
animal-like screech-the call of a wolf
that scents its kill

  then again silence ominous por-
tentous silence broken only by the steady


weird tales

downpour of the rain and the rumble of
the thunder



tucker heard the girl come running
down the stairs in response to her
fathers call that she had been waiting
for the summons was apparent then
he heard the kitchen stove being stirred
into life and the clatter of dishes

  there was a sudden crash the tinkle
of broken glass a scream of mortal
agony the dull rear of a revolver a
womans shrill scream again it was cut
off in the middle

  again that shrieking maniacal laugh
then the wolfish howl this time it was
the howl of the wolf that has made its
kill and is sating itself in fresh warm
blood

   tucker leaped to his feet his hair ris-
ing like the quills of a porcupine he
jerked his automatic from his pocket a
single bound took him to the door open-
ing it he stepped out into the hall

  silence silence save for the howling
of the storm and the machine-gun patter
of the rain as it beat against the roof a
draft swept through the narrow passage-
way the bracket lamp guttered and
smoked its flickering caused fantastic
shadows to leap and dance upon the
plastered walls

   for an instant he stopped and listened
his heart beating like a trip-hammer
far in the rear was an open door he
approached it on tiptoe through it came
a feeble flickering light he stopped just
outside again that sinister silence then
a dull throaty bestial growl-the growl
of a wild animal that is worrying its prey
and defies interference

  he leaped through the opening the
scene etched itself upon his brain with
photographic clearness the window
broken the glass scattered upon the

floor through the opening the wind
howled and roared and the rain splat-
tered a table covered with partly filled
dishes upon it a glass kerosene lamp
its chimney knocked off and broken the
pieces scattered over the oilcloth-covered
table-top and upon the rough board floor
a huge cook stove in which a wood fire
spit and crackled in emulation of the
storm outside the stove door was open
the dancing flames cast a mellow glow
over the whole interior

  just inside the door lay kritz his
crutches were by his side his fat chem-
ical-stained fingers grasped the handle of
his revolver his throat was torn from
his jugular vein spurted a stream of blood
his massive body lay in a great ever-
widening pool of it his long white
whiskers were smeared with it his eyes
wide open stared up through the thick
lenses of his spectacles like bits of dull
agate

  on the other side of the room lay a
girl in life she must have been beautiful
now her clothes were torn the white
smooth flesh of her body was bruised
and mangled

  over her crouched a monster-a sod-
den man-beast with long black matted
hair and tangled beard he was clad only
in undershirt and overalls from them the
water dripped in a glistening flood to
mingle with the crimson on the floor
he was barefooted bareheaded his
sharp fangs were buried in the rounded
throat of the girl while fom his lips
came the dull bestial growl that tucker
had heard before

  the monster raised his shaggy head
and glared at the newcomer tucker in-
voluntarily noted the wound in the others
shoulder where kritzs bullet had found
its mark from it the blood was oozing
down over the front of his wet dirty
shirt
the ravening monster



  for an instant neither of them made
a move tucker was benumbed with fear
on ail fours the beast backed away from
his prey his blood-stained lips were
drawn back over his yellowed fangs
from the corners of his mouth drooled a
slaver his long fingers worked spas-
modically he gathered himself for a
spring

  the lawyer tried to raise his gun his
arms were leaden he was hypnotized
the thing crept toward him from his
throat came a queer whining noise half
yelp half growl suddenly he launched
himself

  the lawyer threw up his arm to pro-
tect his face at the same time his fin-
ger involuntarily pressed the trigger he
saw the flame spurt from the muzzle of
his gun then the huge body landed he
felt fingers feeling for his throat they
closed oyer his windpipe in a throttling
grasp he went down in a heap   

  then came oblivion

when tucker opened his eyes the
storm was still howling and rag-
ing there was a weight upon his legs
by the light of the dancing fire he saw
that it was the body of the monster he
dragged himself from beneath it the
shaggy ill-shaped head was twisted to

one side between the eyes was a small
round blue-black hole edged with crim-
son

  the body of kritz lay where it had
fallen only now the jaw had dropped
and the features had relaxed into a sar-
donic grin as if the whole terrible affair
were a great joke across the room the
girl stared glassily ceilingward

  he leaped to his feet and ran shrieking
from the accursed place

  his car was where he had left it bare-
headed coatless the rain smashing down
on him in a veritable cloudburst he
jerked open the door arrd leaping inside
jammed his foot upon the starter he was
still screaming hysterically as he twisted
the wheel to the right with all his strength
and threw in the clutch the machine
leaped ahead as if it too shared the terror
of the night

  the heavens were torn with the fury
of the elements close behind him some-
thing crashed the odor of sulfur was
wafted to his nostrils upon his wind-
shield was reflected a great light he
turned his head the lightning had struck
the old house and the flames were mount-
ing toward the sky

  he turned the corner onto the graveled
road and fled through the darkness and
the storm like a man accursed

by august w derleth

the story of a strange and unearthly revenge accomplished
from beyond the grave

because the letter was addressed
to all of them miss melora who
was oldest opened it why its
from a lawyer she said talliaferro
from a lawyer

  talliaferro pepperall nodded what
does i- say he asked

  miss tallulah who had picked up the
envelope looked at the postmark and
said from wisconsin most likely
aunt hatties died-shes been sick long
enough

  oh thats what it is said miss mel-
ora and what do you think she went
on looking at talliaferro over the letter
shes left us the house and everything
miss tallulah gasped then began to
chuckle think of it she hating us so
all these years and then leaving us every-
thing

  talliaferro took out a snuff-box and
opened it gravely seems likely theyd
be a catch in that somewhere youve
read it carefully have you melora
melora looked at the letter again and
said we have to live there-thats all
it seems her brow puckered a little
then cleared again and that wouldnt
be bad would it talliaferro we could
get a good price for this place too and
we have been in new orleans for such
a long time now it would be good to
go north for a little

oh but the letter says to take up
residence for the rest of your natural
lives-and we hope that wont be a lit-
tle said talliaferro who had taken the


letter from his sisters hand and was now
reading it carefully

  tallulah said shall we go or not
seems we might as well with all her
money weil be a good deal more com-
fortable than we are now

  melora added we could even af-
ford a maid and perhaps a butler tal-
liaferro

  talliaferro pepperall hesitated i
dont like it he said ive never liked
aunt hattie and i dont see that we
should accept her money now and if
i must say it i dont think weve a right
to take it after the way ive treated her
and after the way she treated us since
then

  you are too proud talliaferro said
melora and tallulah nodded in agree-
ment

  very well said talliaferro i think
wed better write the lawyer today

the pepperalls came to wisconsin
and in the small town where their
aunt hattie had lived and died hating
them as tallulah said they took up resi-
dence in the old-fashioned middle west-
ern mansion there to live secluded lives
as they had done in new orleans

  the house had two stories and best
of all both back and front stairs it was
the largest house in town and even had
servants quarters though to be sure
these were small and cramped the first
floor was taken up largely by a striking
drawing-room and a too ornate dining-
the sheraton mirror



room the second floor was mostly bed-
rooms melora being the oldest got
aunt hatties bedroom the grand one
with the sheraton mirror to the dressing-
table and tallulah was content with the
guest bedroom just next to her while
talliaferro slept some distance down the
hall

  it took them a time to get used to the
house which was even better than they
had hoped despite its definite atmosphere
of past decades

  and just think we could have had
all this before but for you talliaferro
said melora her eves shining with pleas-

  they were standing in the drawing-
room talliaferro smiled reminiscently
it was in this very room that i insulted

her he said what did i call her

melora

  melora shook her head but tallulah
said i remember you said she was a
homely old witch and a wicked med-
dler and then you told her shed be bet-
ter off dead

  talliaferro nodded remembering i
am still not sorry he said she de-
served it and more she had no business
to meddle in fathers affairs as she did
he hesitated not quite sure of himself
but she was not right to take it so
seriously he continued presently i
was quite young then and she might
have overlooked it in time

  i dont think she would have been
so angry if it hadnt been that father re-
fused to punish you said melora slow-

hook the shadow in the glassj


weird tales

ly i do think that turned her anger into
hate finally

  talliaferro shrugged ah well shes
dead and gone now poor soul

  how she would enjoy hearing you
call her poor soul talliaferro ex-
claimed tallulah

  melora said as if suddenly remember-
ing did you ever see the letter aunt
hattie wrote father just before he died
talliaferro

  i saw no letter

  it was the most vindictive writing-
and that was years after it happened she
said you should be punished still and
that some day if she saw you again she
would punish you-it would be waiting
she promised and tallulah and i were
to be punished too for defending you
talliaferro toyed with his snuff-box
ah well he said it doesnt matter
weve got much to thank her for now
melora however was not listening
she was looking beyond her brother into
the hall will you see whether there is
some one in the hall tallulah she

asked abruptly i thought-

  tallulah went forward quickly brushed
aside the portieres and looked into the
hall there is no one here she said
coming back into the room

  melora shrugged i thought i saw
some one standing there looking in at
us from between the curtains couldnt
have been the maid could it

  tallulah shook her head she wont
be here until tomorrow and the butler
comes tonight

  curious i was sure i had seen some
one there she smiled uncertainly
time for dinner soon she said mov-
ing away toward the kitchen

  tallulah said ill be with you in a
moment melora then she turned and
began to go up the front stairs paused a
moment to call down to talliaferro who

was still standing in the drawing-room
and went on

at the top of the stairs she stood for
l a moment to look down the car-
peted hall she was just about to go to
her room when she saw the flirt of a satin
skirt disappearing into meloras room
she went forward thinking i wonder
what melora wants she should be get-
ting dinner just as she came to the door
of meloras room she heard a slight rus-
tling on the bade stairs turning quickly
she saw melora a little breathless coming
up the stairs

  why melora she called down in a
surprized voice i could have sworn i
just saw you go into your room

  no ive been in the kitchen tallu-
lah ive mislaid my handkerchief some-
where and just came up to get another
explained melora as she came toward
her sister

  of course i should have known you
werent wearing satin today said tallu-
lah smiling

  melora stopped standing quite still
satin did you say tallulah

  tallulah looked at her uncertainly i
thought i saw a satin skirt just vanishing
into your room melora she said i
swear i did really

  melora said and i thought a woman
in satin was watching us in the drawing-
room i thought i saw her standing in
the hall

  tallulah laughed weakly were see-
ing things melora i think were too
exhausted with getting things straight-
ened up here ill be glad when the maid
and butler come

  melora said no more she went quick-
ly into her room and got a handkerchief
together the sisters went downstairs to
prepare dinner
the sheraton mirror



a few days after the pepperails had
taken possession the lawyer called
and they had some conversation over the
tea-cups talliaferro was not there

  tallulah asked was aunt hattie
taken badly before she died

  the lawyer blinked a little oddly and
said well i really couldnt say i
wasnt here-that is not in the house-
at the time

  melora thought the lawyer sounded
nervous evasive she said afterward
she put in a question quickly who doc-
tored her perhaps you can tell us that
the lawyer coughed and said doc-
tor mason youll find him down the
street a way but he hadnt been to see
her for ten days before she died

  tallulah protested but thats sheer
neglect id say

  melora nodded in agreement it is
so she said i think wed better see
that doctor

  then the lawyer spoke again his words
coming very reluctantly why i
thought i told you in the letter but i
guess i didnt after all you see your
aunt had gotten somewhat better shed
been up in fact and then one day she
called the doctor and said shed got the
pains again and asked him to come up
that he couldnt do until the afternoon
then he came

  she was dead when he got here it
wasnt his fault because she hadnt died
of the pains shed somehow managed
to-well she tied the scarf to that chan-
delier in her bedroom-its pretty strong
you see the lawyer finished in some
agitation

  melora put her cup down with nervous
fingers her face went suddenly white

  hanged herself did she said tal-
lulah bluntly

  the lawyer nodded

  melora said im glad you told us
now id rather like it if you said no

word to talliaferro that is my brother
hes not so well and shocks arent good
for him

  i see ill say nothing then said
the lawyer smiling but its pretty well
known of course and you cant keep him
from knowing for ever

  melora nodded i suppose not but
ill thank you to say nothing just the
same were not that sociable that wed
hear such talk going about very easily
the lawyer nodded smiled and talked
a little more about the change in weather
the pepperails could expect now in wis-
consin he went at last and left the
sisters sitting alone

tallulah gave her older sister a cu-
rious look it is hard to believe
melora she hating us so and then put-
ting herself out of the way to let us get
the property and all she fingered her
bracelet absently

  melora nodded yes it is strange
i dont understand tallulah i think
theres something wrong somewhere
oh said tallulah quickly do you
feel it too

  melora was startled feel what she
asked sharply what is it tallulah
nothing said her sister nothing
-that is-yes it is something melora
theres some one here hiding in this
house i can feel it some one is watch-
ing us its frightening me im afraid
melora

  melora said ive felt that too some
one watching-a woman  in black
satin

  tallulah swallowed suddenly then
hearing footsteps in the hall beyond bent
forward and whispered harshly aunt
hattie always wore black satin

  talliaferro pepperall came into the
room and sat down lawyer just here
was he have anything to say

  not much said melora easily


weird tales

  tallulah rang for the maid to take
away the tea things

  going up the broad front stairs a little
later tallulah was suddenly confronted
by melora for a moment she was
startled melora motioned her to come
on more quickly

  an odd thing has happened she
said as they went along down the hall
a very odd thing tallulah come into
my room i want you to see it

  they went into meloras room but
tallulah could see nothing out of the
ordinary what is it she asked

  the mirror dont you see it mel-
ora was agitated

  there was a vague dark spot in the
glass of the sheraton mirror instinc-
tively tallulah moved forward and made
an attempt to rub out the spot

  it wont come out said melora it
wasnt there when we came here tal-
lulah i dont understand what it could
be if youll look closely youll see it
isnt on the glass-its in the glass
likely a defect in the glass melora
odd that it should show itself first
now after all these years said melora
dubiously aunt hattie had the mirror
before we were bom

  it is odd said tallulah going slow-
ly from the room but nothing to worry
about-just so it doesnt spoil the mir-
ror

in the night tallulah heard her sis-
ters light tap on her door and meloras
muffled voice are you awake tallulah
in a moment she was out of bed and in
her dressing-gown and in another she
had opened the door and was confronting
melora who was standing there in her
kimono her face white and drawn her
hands twisting nervously

  what has happened asked tallulah
quickly

  come into my room right away i
want you to look at the mirror again
tallulah wanted to brush aside her sis-
ters fear but the expression on meloras
face prevented her without a word she
followed her sister

  meloras room was brilliantly lit mel-
ora strode before tallulah pointing
dramatically at the mirror tallulah
gasped there had been a perceptible
change in the dark spot in the glass it
had grown somewhat larger and had
taken on a form a vague suggestive
shape    tallulah felt suddenly afraid
but looking at her sisters apprehensive
face she knew she must not show her
own fear

  it looks like a reflection doesnt it
she said presently

  melora nodded

  like something hanging in the room
somewhere continued tallulah look-
ing hard at her sister

  tallulah what are you saying pro-
tested melora but she was waiting to hear
more was indeed eager to have tallulah
confirm her own secret thought which she
was herself afraid to voice

  it looks like something hanging-
from the chandelier id say

  at this melora became distinctly less
agitated seeming to breathe a little easier
as if the recognition of some impending
danger had given way to the less fearful
thought of combating it now that
we both see it both feel that way she
began smiling uncertainly perhaps we
can do something ive thought so watch-
ing it grow so strangely i think wed
better say nothing about it to any one but
ourselves-wed best keep it from tal-
liaferro his heart being so bad

  of course said tallulah but why
dont you change your room or sell the
mirror melora

  talliaferro might wonder why be-
the sheraton mirror



sides it doesnt do any harm just a re-
flection like that not even clear

  but its growing clear melora
melora hesitated considering the mir-
ror and the horrific suggestion of the
shadow in the glass well wait and
see she said finally

it was not difficult for the sisters pep-
perall to keep all knowledge of the
spot in the sheraton mirror from tallia-
ferro but it was not as easy to prevent
his noticing the strain and uneasiness
growing daily more obvious in the con-
versation and actions of melora and tal-
lulah talliaferro soon sensed something
wrong in this curious restraint and took
to watching his sisters surreptitiously

  the spot in the glass grew steadily
more and more disturbing gaining shape
daily melora went as little as possible
to her room and took to going to bed
without a light which the watchful tal-
liaferro did not fail to notice during all
of one day the vague reflection grew very
clear and miss melora who had gone
into the room just ahead of her sister
screamed involuntarily at sight of the
shadow in the glass

  look she cried shes hanging
there its aunt hattie

  tallulah shrank back tensing herself
it is she breathed then she took her
sister by the arm holding her tightly
hurting her now i know why she
wanted us here now i know she hating
us all the time when talliaferro sees
her the shock-oh she knew she knew
talliaferro appeared suddenly in the
doorway seeing things again are you
melora he frowned at his sisters i
dont understand what ails you he went
on in an almost petulant voice i over-
heard you talking days ago i think
youd better see a doctor its madness
coming over you

  madness of course its madness
said melora abruptly her voice strident
forgetting to think of talliaferros heart
it may well be i can see something
hanging there look at it look into the
mirror its there i know it is tallia-
ferro look into the mirror

  talliaferro came forward to her side
and looked over her shoulder

  can you see it breathed melora
tell me you can see it talliaferro
talliaferro looked at her queerly and
said i can see it

  what is it tell me ive been seeing
it for days now its worse afternoons
seems and at night tell me isnt it-
aunt hattie

  talliaferro said i dont know what
it could be

  and melora hearing this knew sud-
denly that talliaferro could not see aunt
hattie hanging there at all and he the
one shed hated most all her life

  talliaferro spoke to tallulah when
they were alone together somewhat later
im afraid your sisters losing her mind
tallulah he said without preamble its
that confounded mirror-she sees things
there

  tallulah said yes ive seen the same
thing she tried to keep her voice calm
but it trembled just a little in apprehen-
sion at his reaction

  are both of you mad

  tallulah looked at him her eyes sud-
denly cold if you want to call it that
talliaferro-yes

talliaferro pepperall left his sis-
ter and stamped up the stairs to his
room he was thinking she hated me
most she hated me most and he could
not understand that this madness should
come to melora and tallulah sparing
him when he heard melora going down
the stairs he crept silently the length of
the hall to her room


weird tales

  he pushed open the door and looked
at the mirror there was nothing there
he went back to his room disturbed

  downstairs melora was speaking to
tallulah why cant he see it she
asked why cant he see it

  oh dont you see melora dont
you see if it grew on him day by day
perhaps hed get used to it but if it
came to him suddenly abruptly   dont
you see now

  you mean that suddenly she will let
him see her there and his heart   
oh god tallulah do you think she
would-do that

  tallulah nodded pursing her lips
grimly she hated him terribly and
she promised that his punishment would
be waiting for him-here

  melora drew herself together im
going to smash that glass tallulah
talliaferro pepperall went once more
down the hall pushed open the door of
meloras room and looked again at the
mirror there was a reflection there-a
reflection of something hanging in the
glass and as he looked it swung around
and looked at him it was aunt hattie
talliaferro pulled the door shut and ran
to his room his heait beating wildly i
didnt see k there he thought no i
didnt then abruptly he ran down the
stairs to tell his sisters that he too had
seen

  but they were not there they had
gone through to the back of the house
and were even now going up the back
stairs talliaferro heard them and he
thought they will see her now forget-
ting that they had seen her there often
he heard them walking slowly along the
hall above he wanted to call out to
warn them but he stood there silent
waiting then he heard the door of mel-
oras room open and then a terrible si-
lence

  abruptly he heard both of them
screaming shrilly but he could not bring
himself to run up there to see what they
had seen he came to the foot of the
front stairs and looked up at the top
some one was standing motioning to him
-a woman in black satin he should
come up the figure motioned talliafer-
ro was bewildered a woman in black
satin who could it be black satin
he had known some one somewhere who
always wore black satin who who was
it his mind was not clear but from
somewhere a name came to him-aunt
hattie

  the woman was gone abruptly fear
had encompassed talliaferro it pressed
upon him with a multitude of icy fingers
but a greater force was drawing him slow-
ly forward he went hesitatingly up the
stairs and into meloras room melora
and tallulah were huddled together
staring at the mirror talliaferro looked
at the glass and there he saw the face
of his dead aunt for the second time the
face was distorted horrible-and it was
moving moving about at the end of the
scarf fascinating the three of them tal-
liaferro sat down heavily his heart beat
loudly irregularly and he felt a close-
ness suffocating him his sisters did not
appear to notice him

  talliaferros lips opened and he began
to speak slowly and with apparent ef-
fort she killed herself here he mur-
mured hanged herself where the glass
caught the reflection thats it she was
caught in the glass and couldnt get out

melora turned and seemed to notice
her brother for the first time she
leaned over and touched tallulahs arm
gently he sees her now she whis-
pered he sees her shes watching
him oh look at her eyes

  the eyes of the thing in the glass had
begun to glow shining out toward tal-

                    w t-
the sheraton mirror



liaferro who went on mumbling without
noticing his voice rising steadily to
be caught like that a woman caught we
cant help her wont help her homely
old witch-woman she hates us hates
us and i hate her

  he got up abruptly and went straight
to the glass he bent his head and pressed
his face close to the swinging figure and
then he saw the eyes of the dead woman
open wide with a terrible cry tallia-
ferro caught up meloras steel-backed
brush from the dressing-table and struck
at the glass he struck blindly until he
had broken the mirror into many pieces
then he stepped back a little dropped the
brush and passed his hand vaguely over
his forehead he looked at his startled
sisters and smiled wanly from within
him a tumult arose suddenly engulfing
him then he began to sway gently from
side to side

  melora came to her feet just as he
crashed to the floor and sprawled there
she ran to him coming down on her
knees beside him talliaferro she cried

  and touched him talliaferro she
looked over her shoulder at tallulah and
cried out hes dead

  then tallulah began to scream she
was looking beyond melora at the space
on the wall in the frame of the broken
mirror its the woman there behind
you on the wall

  melora sat there hunched on the floor
as if frozen no tallulah she said
talliaferro killed her i saw him do it
i saw him

  but tallulah went onscreaming she
was still screaming when the frightened
maid made her way into the room fol-
lowed by the butler they found melora
hunched on the floor beside the body of
talliaferro gently stroking one of his
hands she did not appear to see them
for her eyes never once left the jagged
aperture where the mirror had been

  her lips were moving a little and when
the maid touched her shoulder gently
she heard melora whimpering in a little
child voice go away please tallia-
ferro killed you-homely witch-woman
i saw him go away aunt hattie

of the necromancers

an endless army of plague-eaten bodies of tattered skeletons poured in
ghastly torrents through the streets of the city

the legend of mmatmuor and so-
dosma shall arise only in the latter
cycles of earth when the glad
legends of the prime have been forgotten
before the time of its telling many
epochs shall have passed away and the
seas shall have fallen in their beds and
new continents shall have come to birth
perhaps in that day it will serve to be-
guile for a little the black weariness of a
dying race grown hopeless of all but
oblivion i tell the tale as men shall tell
it in zothique the last continent beneath
a dim sun and sad heavens where the
stars come out in terrible brightness be-
fore eventide

mmatmuor and sodosma were nec-
romancers who came from the dark
isle of naat to practise their baleful arts
in tinarath beyond the shrunken seas
but they did not prosper in tinarath for
death was deemed a holy thing by the
people of that gray country and the noth-
ingness of the tomb was not lightly to be
desecrated and the raising up of the dead
by necromancy was held in abomination

  so after a short interval mmatmuor
and sodosma were driven forth by the an-
ger of the inhabitants and were com-
pelled to flee toward cincor a desert of
the south which was peopled only by the
bones and mummies of a race that the
pestilence had slain in former time

      

   the land into which they went lay drear
and leprous and ashen below the huge
ember-colored sun its crumbling rocks
and deathly solitudes of sand would have
struck terror to the hearts of common
men and since they had been thrust out
in that barren place without food or sus-
tenance the plight of the sorcerers might
well have seemed a desperate one but
smiling secretly with the air of conquer-
ors who tread the approaches of a long-
coveted realm sodosma and mmatmuor
walked steadily on into cincor

  unbroken before them through fields
devoid of trees and grass and across the
channels of dried-up rivers there ran the
great highway by which travellers had gone
formerly between cincor and tinarath
here they met no living thing but soon
they came to the skeletons of a horse and
its rider lying full in the road and wear-
ing still the sumptuous harness and rai-
ment which they had worn in the flesh
and mmatmuor and sodosma paused be-
fore the piteous bones on which no shred
of corruption remained and they smiled
evilly at each other

  the steed shall be yours said mmat-
muor since you are a little the elder of
us two and are thus entitled to preced-
ence and the rider shall serve us both and
be the first to acknowledge fealty to us in
cincor

  then in the ashy sand by the wayside
they drew a threefold circle and stand-
the empire of the necromancers



sodosma mounted the
skeleton steed and took up
the jewelled retm

ing together at its center they performed
the abominable rites that compel the dead
to arise from tranquil nothingness and
obey henceforward in all things the dark
will of the necromancer afterward they
sprinkled a pinch of magic powder on the
nostril-holes of the man and the horse
and the white bones creaking mournfully
rose up from where they had lain and
stood in readiness to serve their masters

  so as had been agreed between them
sodosma mounted the skeleton steed and
took up the jewelled reins and rode in
an evil mockery of death on his pale
horse while mmatmuor trudged on be-
side him leaning lightly on an ebon staff
and the skeleton of the man with its rich
raiment flapping loosely followed be-
hind the two like a servitor

  after a while in the gray waste they
found the remnant of another horse and

rider which the jackals had spared and
the sun had dried to the leanness of old
mummies these also they raised op from
death and mmatmuor bestrode the
withered charger and the two magicians
rode on in state like errant emperors with
a iich and a skeleton to attend them
other bones and charnel remnants of men
and beasts to which they came anon
were duly resurrected in like fashion so
that they gathered to themselves an ever-
swelling train in their progress through
cincor

  along the way as they neared yethly-
reom whidi had been the capital they
found numerous tombs and necropoli in-
violate still after many ages and contain-
ing swathed mummies that had scarcely
withered in death all these they raised
up and called from sepulchral night to do
their bidding some they commanded to


weird tales

sow and till the desert fields and hoist
water from the sunken wells others they
left at diverse tasks such as the mummies
had performed in life the century-long
silence was broken by the noise and tu-
mult of myriad activities and the lank
liches of weavers toiled at their shuttles
and the corpses of plowmen followed
their furrows behind carrion oxen

weary with their strange journey and
their oft-repeated incantations
mmatmuor and sodosma saw before them
at last from a desert hill the lofty spires
and fair unbroken domes of yethlyreom
steeped in the darkening stagnant blood of
ominous sunset

  it is a goodly land said mmatmuor
and you and i will share it between us
and hold dominion over all its dead and
be crowned as emperors on the morrow
in yethlyreom

  aye replied sodosma for there is
none living to dispute us here and those
that we have summoned from the tomb
shall move and breathe only at our dicta-
tion and may not rebel against us

  so in the blood-red twilight that thick-
ened with purple they entered yethly-
reom and rode on among the lofty lamp-
less mansions and installed themselves
with their grisly retinue in that stately and
abandoned place where the dynasty of
nimboth emperors had reigned for two
thousand years with dominion over cin-
cor

  in the dusty golden halls they lit the
empty lamps of onyx by means of their
cunning sorcery and supped on royal
viands provided from past years which
they evoked in like manner ancient and
imperial wines were poured for them in
moonstone cups by the fleshless hands of
their servitors and they drank and feasted
and revelled in fantasmagoric pomp de-
ferring till the morrow the resurrection of
those who lay dead in yethlyreom

  they rose betimes in the dark crimson
dawn from the opulent palace-beds in
which they had slept for much remained
to be done everywhere in that forgotten
city they went busily to and fro work-
ing their spells on the people that had
died in the last year of the pest and had
lain unburied and having accomplished
this they passed beyond yethlyreom into
that other city of high tombs and mighty
mausoleums in which lay the nimboth
emperors and the more consequential cit-
izens and nobles of cincor

  here they bade their skeleton slaves to
break in the sealed doors with hammers 
and then with their sinful tyrannous in-
cantations they called forth the imperial
mummies even to the eldest of the dy-
nasty all of whom came walking stiffly
with lightless eyes in rich swathings sewn
with flame-bright jewels and also later
they brought forth to a semblance of life
many generations of courtiers and digni-
taries

  moving in solemn pageant with dark
and haughty and hollow faces the dead
emperors and empresses of cincor made
obeisance to mmatmuor and sodosma
and attended them like a train of captives
through all the streets of yethlyreom
afterward in the immense throne-room of
the palace the necromancers mounted the
high double throne where the rightful
rulers had sat with their consorts amid
the assembled emperors in gorgeous and
funereal state they were invested with
sovereignty by the sere hands of the mum-
my of hestaiyon earliest of the nimboth
line who had ruled in half-mythic years
then all the descendants of hestaiyon
crowding the room in a great throng ac-
claimed with toneless echo-like voices the
dominion of mmatmuor and sodosma

  thus did the outcast necromancers find
for themselves an empire and a subject
people in the desolate barren land where
the empire of the necromancers



the men of tinarath had driven them
forth to perish reigning supreme over
all the dead of cincor by virtue of their
malign magic they exercised a baleful
despotism tribute was borne t them
by fleshless porters from outlying realms
and plague-eaten corpses and tall mum-
mies scented with mortuary balsams went
to and fro upon their errands in yethly-
reom or heaped before their greedy eyes
from inexhaustible vaults the cobweb-
blackened gold and dusty gems of antique
time

  dead laborers made their palace-gar-
dens to bloom with long-perished flow-
ers liches and skeletons toiled for them
in the mines or reared superb fantastic
towers to the dying sun chamberlains
and princes of old time were their cup-
bearers and stringed instruments were
plucked for their delight by the slim
hands of empresses with golden hair that
had come forth untarnished from the
night of the tomb those that were fair-
est whom the plague and the worm had
not ravaged overmuch they took for their
lemans and made to serve their necro-
philic lust



in all things the people of cincor per-
formed the actions of life at the will
of mmatmuor and sodosma they spoke
they moved they ate and drank as in life
they heard and saw and felt with a simil-
itude of the senses that had been theirs
before death but their brains were en-
thralled by a dreadful necromancy they
recalled but dimly their former existence
and the state to which they had been sum-
moned was empty and troublous and shad-
ow-like their blood ran chill and slug-
gish mingled with water of lethe and
the vapors of lethe clouded their eyes

  dumbly they obeyed the dictates of
their tyrannous lords without rebellion or
protest but filled with a vague illimitable

weariness such as the dead must know
when having drunk of eternal sleep they
are called back once more to the bitterness
of mortal being they knew no passion
or desire or delight only the black lan-
guor of their awakening from lethe and
a gray ceaseless longing to return to that
interrupted slumber

  youngest and last of the nimboth em-
perors was illeiro who had died in the
first month of the plague and had lain in
his high-built mausoleum for two hun-
dred years before the coming of the necro-
mancers

                                    

  raised up with his people and his fath-
ers to attend the tyrants illeiro had re-
sumed the emptiness of existence without
question and had felt no surprize he
had accepted his own resurrection and that
of his ancestors as one accepts the indig-
nities and marvels of a dream he knew
that he had come back to a faded sun to
a hollow and spectral world to an order
of things in which his place was merely
that of an obedient shadow but at first
he was troubled only like the others by
a dim weariness and a pale hunger for
the lost oblivion

  drugged by the magic of his overlords
weak from the age-long nullity of death
he beheld like a somnambulist the enor-
mities to which his fathers were subjected
yet somehow after many days a feeble
spark awoke in the sodden twilight of his
mind

  like something lost and irretrievable
beyond prodigious gulfs he recalled the
pomp of his reign in yethlyreom and the
golden pride and exultation that had been
his in youth and recalling it he felt a
vague stirring of revolt a ghostly resent-
ment against the magicians who had haled
him forth to this calamitous mockery of
life darkly he began to grieve for his
fallen state and the mournful plight of
his ancestors and his people


weird tales

  day by day as a cup-bearer in the halls
where he had ruled aforetime illeiro saw
the doings of mmatmuor and sodosma
he saw their caprices of cruelty and lust
their growing drunkenness and gluttony
he watched them wallow in their necro-
mantic luxury and become lax with indo-
lence gross with indulgence they neg-
lected the study of their art they forgot
many of their spells but still they ruled
mighty and formidable and lolling on
couches of purple and rose they planned
to lead an army of the dead against tin-
arath

  dreaming of conquest and of vaster
necromancies they grew fat and slothful
as worms that have installed themselves
in a charnel rich with corruption and
pace by pace with their laxness and tyran-
ny the fire of rebellion mounted in the
shadowy heart of illeiro like a flame that
struggles with lethean damps and
slowly with the waxing of his wrath
there returned to him something of the
strength and firmness that had been his in
life seeing the turpitude of the oppres-
sors and knowing the wrong that had
been done to the helpless dead he heard
in his brain the clamor of stifled voices
demanding vengeance

  among his fathers through the palace-
halls of yethlyreem illeiro moved silent-
ly at the bidding of the masters or stood
awaiting their command he poured in
their cups of onyx the amber vintages
brought by wizardry from hills beneath a
younger sun he submitted to their con-
tumelies and insults and night by night
he watched them nod in their drunken-
ness till they fell asleep flushed and
gross amid their arrogated splendor

  there was little speech among the liv-
ing dead and son and father daughter
and mother lover and beloved went to
and fro without sign of recognition mak-
ing no comment on their evil lot but at

last one midnight when the tyrants lay
in slumber and the flames wavered in the
necromantic lamps illeiro took counsel
with hestaiyon his eldest ancestor who
had been famed as a great wizard in fable
and was reputed to have known the secret
lore of antiquity

hestaiyon stood apart from the
others in a comer of the shadowy
hall he was brown and withered in his
crumbling mummy-cloths and his light-
less obsidian eyes appeared to gaze still
upon nothingness he seemed not to have
heard the questions of illeiro but at
length in a dry rustling whisper he re-
sponded 

  i am old and the night of the sepul-
cher was long and i have forgotten much
yet groping backward across the void of
death it may be that i shall retrieve some-
thing of my former wisdom and between
us we shall devise a mode of deliverance
and hestaiyon searched among the shreds
of memory as one who reaches into a
place where the worm has been and the
hidden archives of old time have rotted in
their covers till at last he remembered
and said

  i recall that i was once a mighty wiz-
ard and among other things i knew the
spells of necromancy but employed them
not deeming their use and the raising up
of the dead an abhorrent act also i
possessed other knowledge and perhaps
among the remnants of that ancient lore
there is something which may serve to
guide us now for i recall a dim dubit-
able prophecy made in the primal years
at the founding of yethlyreom and the
empire of cincor the prophecy was
that an evil greater than death would be-
fall the emperors and the people of cin-
cor in future time and that the first and
the last of the nimboth dynasty confer-
ring together would effect a mode of re-
lease and the lifting of the doom the
the empire of the necromancers



evil was not named in the prophecy but
it was said that the two emperors would
learn the solution of their problem by the
breaking of an ancient clay image that
guards the nethermost vault below the
imperial palace in yethlyreom

  then having heard this prophecy from
the faded lips of his forefather illeiro
mused a while and said

  i remember now an afternoon in early
youth when searching idly through the
unused vaults of our palace as a boy
might do i came to the last vault and
found therein a dusty uncouth image of
clay whose form and countenance were
strange to me and knowing not the
prophecy i turned away in disappoint-
ment and went back as idly as i had come
to seek the moted sunlight

  then stealing away from their heedless
kinfolk and carrying jewelled lamps they
had taken from the hall hestaiyon and
illeiro went downward by subterranean
stairs beneath the palace and threading
like implacable furtive shadows the maze
of nighted corridors they came at last to
the lowest crypt

  here in the black dust and clotted cob-
webs of an immemorial past they found
as had been decreed the clay image whose
rude features were those of a forgotten
earthly god and illeiro shattered the
image with a fragment of stone and he
and hestaiyon took from its hollow center
a great sword of unrusted steel and a
heavy key of untarnished bronze and tab-
lets of bright brass on which were in-
scribed the various things to be done so
that cincor should be rid of the dark
reign of the necromancers and the people
should win back to oblivious death

  so with the key of untarnished bronze
illeiro unlocked as the tablets had in-
structed him to do a low and narrow
door at the end of the nethermost vault
beyond the broken image and he and

hestaiyon saw as had been prophesied
the coiling steps of somber stone that led
downward to an undiscovered abyss
where the sunken fires of earth still
burned and leaving illeiro to ward the
open door hestaiyon took up the sword
of unrusted steel in his thin hand and
went back to the hall where the necro-
mancers slept lying a-sprawl on their
couches of rose and purple with the wan
bloodless dead about them in patient
ranks

upheld by the ancient prophecy and
the lore of the bright tablets hestai-
yon lifted the great sword and struck off
the head of mmatmuor and the head of
sodosma each with a single blow then
as had been directed he quartered the
remains with mighty strokes and the
necromancers gave up their unclean lives
and lay supine without movement adding
a deeper red to the rose and a brighter
hue to the sad purple of their couches

  then to his kin who stood silent and
listless hardly knowing their liberation
the venerable mummy of hestaiyon spoke
in sere murmurs but authoritatively as a
king who issues commands to his chil-
dren the dead emperors and empresses
stirred like autumn leaves in a sudden
wind and a whisper passed among them
and went forth from the palace to be
communicated at length by devious ways
to all the dead of cincor

  all that night and during the blood-
dark day that followed by wavering
torches or the light of the failing sun an
endless army of plague-eaten liches of tat-
tered skeletons poured in a ghastly tor-
rent through the streets of yethlyreom and
along the palace-hall where hestaiyon
stood guard above the slain necroman-
cers unpausing with vague fixed eyes
they went on like driven shadows to seek
the subterranean vaults below the palace
to pass through the open door where ii-

leiro waited in the last vault and then to
wend downward by a thousand thousand
steps to the verge of that gulf in which
boiled the ebbing fires of earth there
from the verge they flung themselves to a
second death and the clean annihilation
of the bottomless flames

  but after all had gone to their release
hestaiyon still remained alone in the fad-
ing sunset beside the cloven corpses of
mmatmuor and sodosma there as the
tablets had directed him to do he made
trial of those spells of elder necromancy
which he had known in his former wis-
dom and cursed the dismembered bodies
with that perpetual life-in-death which
mmatmuor and sodosma had sought to
inflict upon the people of cincor and
maledictions came from the pale lips and
the heads rolled horribly with glaring
eyes and the limbs and torsos writhed on
their imperial couches amid clotted
blood then with no backward look

knowing that all was done as had been
ordained and predicted from the first the
mummy of hestaiyon left the necroman-
cers to their doom and went wearily
through the nighted labyrinth of vaults
to rejoin illeiro

  so in tranquil silence with no further
need of words illeiro and hestaiyon
passed through the open door of the
nether vault and illeiro locked the door
behind them with its key of untarnished
bronze and thence by the coiling
stairs they wended their way to the verge
of the sunken flames and were one with
their kinsfolk and their people in the
last ultimate nothingness

  but of mmatmuor and sodosma men
say that their quartered bodies crawl to
and fro to this day in yethlyreom finding
no peace or respite from their doom of
life-in-death and seeking vainly through
the black maze of nether vaults the door
that was locked by illeiro

a maddened group of cajuns and a horde of vampires

it must have been a fierce and
bloody fight i heard excited talk of
it as soon as  stepped from the train
in labrandi my duties as district high-
way engineer had brought me there be-
fore and nearly every one in the little
town knew who i was but they are folk
shy in the presence of strangers most of
them in that rural almost isolated sec-
tion i was an outsider and sensed some-
thing of their talk kept apart from me
as such

  i heard only that there had been a wild
fight the night before between the sher-
iffs men and a gang of murderous gip-
sies-though particulars were more than
vague about the gipsies on the island
in the fork of labranch bayou they said
it was and that roused my interest at
once for it was there the highway de-
partment was building a difficult stretch
of road no contractor had cared to under-

weird tales

found in the road camp brought me back
at once to town

  i had been told-almost the only defi-
nite information i had got-that i would
find young delacroix the timekeeper and
camp clerk at the only hotel in labranch
i located his room and entered in a con-
siderable temper when he opened to my
knock

  come in-sit down delacroix greet-
ed me pleasantly waving to a chair and
himself slumped casually upon the bed
his gesture embraced a bottle of whisky
half empty that sat upon a table handy
to his reach have a drink

  no i wont have a drink i snapped
is everybody else drunk too i went
out to the job and found two teams
idling around and a half-dozen cajun
and nigger laborers sitting stupidly on
stumps-no engineer no foreman no
timekeeper-nobody

  i guess so delacroix agreed vaguely
pouring himself a drink i was by now
thoroughly exasperated

  you guess so i exploded youre
like those cajun laborers for all your
two years at the university the total in-
formation i got out of them was where
to find you they wouldnt even tell me
where the foreman was nor gregory
the latter was-the departments section
engineer

  they dont know where gregory and
the foreman are-but youll never see
them again delacroix informed mildly
after he had swallowed his drink then
with sudden force-have a drink and
keep quiet-or just keep quiet-and ill
tell you about it sit down

  startled i obeyed without thinking
dropping into the chair behind me as i
was on the point of rising and rescuing
my dignity delacroixs words caught my
attention forgetting my anger i sat and
listened

  this is the meat of what i heard

old man landry delacroix began
had a son who was attacked one
evening after sunset while he was hunt-
ing in the woods of labranch island
they found what was left of him the next
day a small wound in his throat and his
body drained of blood well right
away everybody said that placides wife
did it-the wife placide duboin buried
one night a dozen years ago because he
thought he had killed her but nita his
wife came out of her grave an undead
thing who preyed on the living after sun-
down placide was her first victim

  this dead-alive woman who lay like
a corpse in her grave during each day
rose and walked abroad at night between
sunset and dawn seeking living victims
to quench her thirst for blood old lan-
drys son was one of the first to fall her
prey nearly eleven years ago they found
him the next day and buried him with a
stake through his heart so he did not
lie where nita left him to arise the next
night with his own terrible craving for
blood-to be from then on another such
thing as she

  oh no i am not drunk not yet at
any rate i am trying to tell you what be-
came of gregory and why the road camp
is almost empty do you want to listen
or not

  well anyway nita and those who fell
into her clutches and became like her
could not get off that island between the
forks of labranch bayou an island some
six to eight miles wide by nearly fifteen
miles long vampires and werewolves
you understand can not cross running
water

  it is across this island that we have
been building the new highway one
night not very long ago while i was tell-
ing gregory the story of placides wife
the last of placjdes wife



there was a knock on the door and
who do you suppose was there placides
wife herself she pretended otherwise
naturally but i recognized her and called
to old landry who had hoped to meet
her and been prepared for the meeting
ever since his sons death he carried a
gun loaded with silver bullets blessed by
the priest the only kind that can kill a
vampire but nita ran to the woods be-
fore landry came up and i kept him
from following in the forest with her
pack around her she would have made
short work of the old man

  it had become the main thing in lan-
drys life to even up with nita on ac-
count of his son he finally got so im-
patient that he went into the woods alone
one evening hoping to put a silver bullet
into nita doubtless he was a little crazy
on the subject and it turned out that
nita got him at least we found he had
gone and he did not come back

  gregory was sort of skeptical and
didnt much believe the story i told him
about placides wife he insisted nita
was nothing but one of a band of gipsy
thieves and murderers he was a special
deputy sheriff gregory so he could carry
a gun on account of our payroll and
things like that and he was pretty mad
you understand about old man landry
he was already disgusted because it was
hard for us to get men who were not
afraid of nita and would stay in our
camp on the island at night and they
would come straggling in late every
morning so gregory got most of our
men together the next morning and gave
them guns then sent word to the sheriff
here in labranch that he was going into
the swamps and round up the gip-
sies ha i was one of those who went

  we went clear down to where the
swamp begins at the end of the island
on the bay without seeing any sign of

anybody except two trappers we ran
across men we knew nobody expected
to find nita except gregory the men
began to get uneasy late in the afternoon
and decided to turn back before sundown
caught us away from camp gregory
didnt like it but what was he going to
do the men told him he could stay if
he wanted but they were going bade
gregory used some language i wish i
could remember-me i never can say
what i want to when im mad-but he
turned back with the rest

                                      

sundown found us a good mile away
from camp deep in the woods we
still could count on nearly an hour of
daylight and gregory sneered at the
mens uneasiness because the sun had set
but everybody else was uneasy some more
than others the woods were thick and
in the fading light of late day dim and
shadowy except for the noise we made
ourselves the forest was still and quiet
but it was an uncomfortable quiet as if
the trees all around us hid things that
watched and waited their own time to
show themselves so

   suddenly amid startled exclamations
we stopped in our tracks anybody would
have stopped i think we all saw the
gleaming shape that barred our way at
the same moment in a little cleared
space ahead of us stood a slender figure
a woman whose body gleamed in the red
light of sunset like a statue carved from
smooth old ivory she was completely
nude except that the light breeze wrapped
the ends of her shining black hair which
hung like a dark cloak almost to the backs
of her knees carelessly about her hips
her face was the most beautiful  have
ever seen on a woman beautiful that is
except for the evil in her bright eyes and
the cruelty in the smile of her scarlet lips

   but there was nothing beautiful about
her to us-we knew that here was the


weird tales

thing we had hunted-that we had met
at last with placides wife

  nita stood with that mocking smile
looking at us from between narrowed
lids that slanted upward a little at the
comers she seemed careless and amused
but i saw her nostrils twitch from where
i stood like any other wild naked thing
of the woods her eyes opened suddenly
wide and they blazed with the same
light i have seen in a cats when she
pounced upon a mouse she waved one
slim hand toward us in a swift fierce
gesture

  the woods were suddenly alive si-
lent grinning figures some clad and
some as naked as she sprang at us from
among the trees without waiting for a
word from gregory our men blazed
away with shotguns and pistols gregory
himself aimed squarely at nita and i
saw his shotgun spit fire nita stood
straining forward on her toes watching
as her pack closed with us her lips drawn
tightly back from her sharp pointed teeth
i saw her laugh horribly as gregory shot
at her then she sprang at him he
pumped buckshot from his gun at close
range but she merely gurgled with that
horrible laughter and leaped at him
after that i was too busy with a shock-
headed and fojal-smelling old devil who
flung himself on me to bother with
gregory and nita

  nitas band numbered about the same
as ours but they had the strength of oxen
the thing with which i fought for all his
blazing red eyes and dripping mouth
looked like only a scrawny old man but
his hands were iron and i was helpless
in his grip it seemed that i was tangled
in a web and my arms and legs would
not move as i wanted them to after the
old man glared into my eyes it was like
a nightmare when you try to scream to
run and can not unable to do more

than stare ahead with my eyes popping
in fright i felt the awful reeking mouth
of that ancient horror drooling upon my
neck dimly i heard nita screaming
felt the cold lips draw back from my
flesh nitas voice kept on sounding as
if she moved swiftly from one place to
another all about was a snarling as of
hungry beasts driven from their kills
then everything swam in blackness

  my head cleared after a minute and i
realized that i was being carried along
through the forest thrown over the shoul-
der of that old creature who stank and
who had fought me i said he was old
and scrawny but he carried me as easily
as a ten-pound sack of meal we went
through the woods as fast as a horse
trots the trampling of many feet keeping
pace with us i twisted my head about
trying to see

  we went through a dim open space
i twisted enough to look ahead of the
dirty old one who carried me and saw
nita with gregory slung on her back
leading the way as easily as though she
ran unburdened around and behind
the hell-pack ran with us each of them
carried a man and some of them seemed
to be carrying double all flitted through
the woods silently and lightly as dark
shadows

  on we went and i knew our direction
more by instinct than otherwise toward
the southern end of the island where the
dank woods blend into the swamp
that becomes a marsh lying along the
gulf

soon we were in the swamp often
i heard the suck of soggy earth that
clutched at hurrying feet once scummy
water splashed into my down-hung face
as the pack pattered through a shallow
pool of smelly stagnant water all this
time until we finally came to a stop i lay
the last of placides wife



quietly over that old ones shoulder his
arms were about my legs like bands of
steel but not even the thought of struggle
or escape came into my queerly dulled
brain

  when the troop finally halted i dimly
saw that we were in the middle of a large
piece of dry land slightly higher than
the swamp around it and almost clear of
trees the old pig who carried me let
me slip head first to the ground thanks
to the soft ground and none to him my
neck was not broken it was bad enough
at that

  i sat up and looked around that place
other men no doubt also dropped like
sacks of onions were lying on the ground
or sitting looking stupid like me a few
were getting groggily to their feet not
much showed plainly in the dark but
there were other figures with eyes gleam-
ing like wolves standing over those on
the ground or getting in the way of the
few who tottered on their feet all of
these with glowing eyes were half stretch-
ing their hands toward the ones they
stood by and at the same time all looking
eagerly at something near where i sat
i looked to see what it was they stared
at so and saw that nita was standing
there her eyes were glowing like yel-
low coals and she had one hand out to
steady gregory on his feet then she
waved her other hand lazily toward a
clump of bushes and the shadows with
eyes pulled the figures upon the ground
to their feet and prodded them in that
direction

  all at once the knoll began to glow
with a dim bluish light like a wet match
in the dark it came from nowhere you
understand and did not seem to light
the swamp beyond the wide knoll the
light grew stronger while my dirty old
one pushed me along with the rest

  nita led toward a covert of bushes al-

most in the middle of the knoll within
these bushes the blue light glowed strong-
er than anywhere else nita parted the
growth and stepped through leading
gregory we pushed and jostled our way
behind her

  we scrambled through into a circular
open place in the center of which was a
low mound of earth nita urged gregory
toward the mound and gently forced him
to sit she herself leaped lightly up and
turned to face the rest of us her body
gleaming now like a silver column in the
blue light my old one pushed me closer
and the others crowded around nita
looked us over carefully for a moment
before she spoke

  there are two more than we are
she said evidently talking for the benefit
of her pack i will keep the man i have
taken-she motioned toward gregory-

and also those other two- she

paused and leaned slightly forward as
the place hummed with angry murmurs
and snarls of protest her eyes blazed
from her narrowed lids and she snarled
back at them

  pigs and cattle i say that three are
mine i am first among you the mother
of the pack and i claim the right her
gaze rested on me i will take that one
she said pointing the smelly old crea-
ture who had my arm tightened his grip
until his hard skinny fingers sank into
my flesh

  no he screeched i caught this
one and i keep him

  durand has two take that one from
him the old one followed the point of
her finger and observed a wolf-eyed one
who held fast to a pair of our men they
were two young fellows out of our grub-
bing gang and though they stood as
quietly as terrified sheep in the clutch of
the one nita called durand they were
both husky full-blooded youngsters my


weird tales

sale vieux peered at them both so much
larger and stronger than i and grinned
slobbering as he grinned he pushed me
toward nita and with a little squeal of
satisfaction ran and pounced upon the
nearest of the grubbers

  nita coolly claimed a third captive
and the pack started to hustle the rest of
our men out of the circular enclosure
with sudden eagerness nita halted them
with a sharp word

  wait she called her hand upraised
the pack paused remember nita
continued there is a new one among us
who must have a grave that he can not
dig himself    let the newcomers dig
his-and their own-before you   
drink  then she waved them away

most of the dullness that had numbed
my wits cleared with the transfer
of that old things attention from me
and i suddenly observed one that i had
not before noticed i saw old landry
he whom we had come to avenge
pushing from the place as eagerly as any
of nitas crew one knotted handgripped
a staring white-faced figure-a man he
had worked beside a few days before-
that he regarded with greedy blazing
eyes landry was the recruit to whom
nita had referred

  the place was- left bare of all except
nita and us three she had claimed
gregory myself and a youngish fellow
named alcide breaux nita bent and
smiled into gregorys eyes

  i leave you for a little while she
told him and it amused me even then
because she said it as if it was something
for greg to regret she stared into his
eyes a moment more and added wait
here quietly until i come back

  stepping lithely down she came over
to me a mocking smile upon her lips

  so msieu delacroix we meet
again she waited for me to answer

but i only stared at her trying to put my
finger on something that puzzled me

  this time you can not call for old
landry to come with his silver bullets-
as you did another time when i knocked
at your door in the road camp this little
talk is different yes

  that was it her talk queer is it
not how trifles occupy the mind at such
times

  yes i said your talk is a whole
lot different the last time i heard you
your english it was not so good

  aha msieu le cajun she mocked
your own is rather queer she smiled
indulgently and explained i am speak-
ing my own language the language
spoken in the high mountains in a coun-
try far beyond the sea you understand
because i will it and it seems to you that
i speak a familiar tongue

  i shrugged because i could think of
nothing to say nita touched my chin
with the tip of her finger which was cold
as the hand of death i bent my head
under her touch so that i looked full
into her dark eyes that seemed to have
points of flame dancing in their depths
once more i began to feel dull and
numb and my wits grew sluggish it
was an effort to think to concentrate
nita lightly flipped my chin as she took
away her finger

  you amuse me-a very little but still
you amuse me i heard her mocking
voice in a kind of daze i think i shall
leave you until later and take this other

oaf go sit upon my- whatever

she was about to say she checked it and
finished go sit with gregory

  with no thought to do otherwise i
went and sat down where she told me
then i saw she was staring into breauxs
face as she had into mine but her smile
was a terrible and ghoulish thing while
her eyes were like flaming pools of fire
the last of placides wife



  come she commanded in a husky
quivering whisper obediently though
with a fleeting spasm of despair twitching
his face breaux followed he moved
too slowly for nitas liking for she seized
his arm and drew him with feverish
eagerness across the clearing into the
screening bushes she pulled him nita
fairly panted as she pushed poor alcide
through the growth and i thought dully
that her red mouth drooled it is horri-
ble when i think of it now but i looked
on without interest then as the bushes
closed behind them and nita and alcide
   were gone   

how long gregory and i sat there
alone i have no idea neither of
us spoke and time seemed to stand still
it would have been too much effort to
talk or move or even lie back to rest
we kept motionless i think and waited
nothing at all mattered until nita sud-
denly came back and smiled down at us

  the fire had left her eyes and she
seemed younger and refreshed   there
was a smile of exhilaration on her beauti-
ful red lips redder now than before i
saw the tip of her tongue lick over those
lips with satisfaction poor alcide

  nita dropped lazily down between us
smiling first at gregory then at me
dont be so dull-witted she reproved
she must have had some deliberate inten-
tion of lifting the spell that kept us so
listless for my brain cleared with her
words and i straightened as i sat so did
gregory nita leaned toward him

  ah that is better she breathed it
has been long since any one except stupid
clod-like men little better than brute
beasts came to this place she reached
out a hand put it softly upon gregs
knee her eyes half closed smoldering
with a fire different from the fierce light
that had flamed in them earlier in the
evening there are other good things

besides food and drink-warm salty
drink this body of mine is still a
womans  is it not fair

  she leaned lazily back upon her hands
and gregory and i held our breaths to-
gether here was a gorgeous creature of
pale ivory and ebony and scarlet pale
ivory body scarlet lips and long loose
hair as black and bewitching as sin

  god she was beautiful there was
reason for gregory to lean toward her
biting his lips-even though he knew
now what sort of thing she was nita
had said that she came from a far land
her old-ivory skin with its hint of under-
lying olive tint and the upward slant of
her eyes at the corners told that she spoke
the truth the shameless creature lay
back and laughed with brazen delight at
gregorys open fascination

  do you find me beautiful she de-
manded naively sitting up quickly she
eagerly asked do you like beautiful
things

  gregory stared at her without answer-
ing but there was something in his si-
lence that seemed to please nita as well
as words will you come to me willing-
ly gregory rather than as that one of
your men i-had-tonight without my
arms and love to make-what happened
-a caress and a promise of future de-
light in me will you take a love no
mortal woman could give

  suddenly she struck the earth with one
small hand do you know what this
is she demanded without waiting for
answer she told us it is where i lie and
rest during the day-is it not in a good
place here in the heart of this swamp
no trappers or hunters come so far and
you will be safe with me she laughed
with sudden malicious merriment

  old placide that dear husband of
mine showed me this place there was
a gipsy peddler who wanted both me


weird tales

and placides money the money he got
for his land when oil was found on it
before i came to labranch and married
him the money was buried near our
house but placide was frightened of the
peddler and dug it up and brought it
here where he knew no one would ever
come to look for it i spied on him when
he did it and followed him here after-
ward i remembered this place his
money is there now at the head of my
earthen couch she laughed gleefully
again but sobered quickly she leaned
toward gregory and her voice was vi-
brant with passion gregory half raised
his hands and her pale body writhed into
his arms i stared you can imagine with
my mouth open i was astonished at
nita but i was ashamed of gregory i
was thinking of poor alcide you under-
stand

  then in a flash i comprehended
nitas wild mood fixed her interest on
him and gregory played up to her so she
would not notice me he was forcing
himself to hold her close swallowing
his disgust to bend his head to those un-
clean red lips-so i might slip out and
escape

  as greg seized nita in a sudden fierce
grip that i thought was fine acting i
crept on hands and knees behind her
back toward that place through which
she took alcide creeping through the
bushes i came on something that caused
me to jerk upright scratching my face
on the twigs around me i looked down
into the dead staring face of alcide and
shivered all over as i made the cross be-
hind me was that mound in the darkness
with a glow like phosphorus hanging
around it and around two dark forms so
close together that they were like one   

not until that minute did i fully
realize the awful nightmare of that
place and the things that lived there all

my life i had heard tales of vampires and
werewolves i had listened to stories of
placides wife and how men had gone
into this same swamp and had not come
back true i wondered and i had been
careful to keep in camp after sundown
since we had been on the island but the
tales had been tales and this was some-
thing else i felt the little silver medal
hung on a cord around my neck and whis-
pered to all the saints i could remember
heh you can believe that

  very carefully i poked my head out
and looked around there was not much
of a moon and all i could see at first
was those other mounds that covered the
flat knoll the bluish glow that had
lighted up the place when we first came
had died away but there was that sort of
phosphorous haze about some of the
mounds and i gradually made out some
dark objects lying or hunkered up on all
of them in most cases there were two
of them on each mound-one lying across
the other

  in a flash i knew what those dark
shapes were one of each pair was a
man of our party the other was the thing
that owned the mound  it was horri-
ble i tell you those devils were lying
there on our poor fellows still and quiet
like dogs that have gorged on too much
meat pff-f

  i remembered that i didnt have time
to get sick at the stomach you compre-
hend i wanted to be going to get away
from there and bring back help to greg-
ory the way we had come was mostly
over a dry path through the swamp i
wondered if i could slip across the knoll
and get back the same way i started to
find out crawling on hands and knees
and holding my breath to keep from mak-
ing a sound

  one of the mounds was close by but
i crawled past it without anything happen-

                     w t-
the last of placides wife



ing after going a little further i saw
that whichever way i turned there was
nothing for it but to creep between two
more i went forward inch by inch cold
sweat running down into my eyes but
the things lying on the mounds kept lying
there they were so close together that i
had to crawl near enough to see that the
mounds were heaps of turned-up raw
clods there was an open hole to the side
of them dully i wondered how much
trouble it was for the things to pull the
dirt in on top of them when they crawled
in their holes at sun-up    my heart
stood still when the one on my right made
a noise in its throat and moved a little
but it was quiet after that and i crept on

  there was not much farther to go until
i would be on the path through the
swamp one more heap of raw clods i
had to pass but there was a clump of
those low bushes near it that would hide
me as i passed i reached the bushes
when a low squeaking noise made me sink
flat on my stomach i listened my ears
strained like my nerves and heard it again
-it seemed to come from over my head
i looked up the white skeleton of a dead
cypress stood on the other side of that
grave the bushes grew by hanging to the
lowest limb of the dead tree was a black
something that looked like a bat-only it
couldnt be but it was a bat as big as
one of those buzzards hanging there by
its feet and making overgrown squeaks
as bats do in their sleep

  i went around the bushes hugging the
ground i had that bat all figured out you
understand-there had been only one
black splotch on those clods under the
dead cypress

  the bat was too much on my mind i
didnt notice where i was going some-
thing moved out there ahead of me i
had run right onto another one of those
vampire nests-two glowing eyes glared
w t-

into mine and a great wolf-thing-that
i knew was no wolf-rose up from on
the other side of a hole not twenty feet

away

   the wolf snarled i could see the gleam
of its teeth in the dim moonlight i knew
that i was caught that i had to run for
it there was no use in waiting there for
that thing to come slobbering at my
throat the swamp was right ahead of
me i jumped up and dashed for it and
that wolf howled and dashed after me

never did i go anywhere as fast as
i went from that place the howls
of the wolf behind me roused the knoll
a dozen howls answered as if that many
of the vampires took up the chase in the
form of wolves i had no thonght of
path now but plunged in blind fear
through the swamp once more i felt
of the little silver medal of the virgin
hung around my neck i felt it while i
called silently on all the saints i could re-
member

  the wolf panted at my heels and only
my terrible fright kept me ahead of it for
so long it was bound to catch me-i
could almost feel its hot breath on my
back i whirled just as the beast put on
an extra spurt to spring at my shoulders
what good my bare hands could have
done against that slavering terror i can
not imagine but i threw them out in-
stinctively

  something strange happened one
clenched hand had torn the blessed little
medal from its cord around my neck that
was pure accident and it was also acci-
dent that i cast that medal straight into
the open maw of the mad beast as it
sprang at me for one terrible instant i
felt the hot stinking breath of the thing
in my face then it dropped down buck-
ing and making choking noises in its
throat


weird tales

  whether the holiness of the little medal
had anything to do with it or whether it
was a plain case of the wolf-thing chok-
ing on it i neither knew nor cared the
main thing was for me to go on while the
going was good and i did

  suddenly out of the darkness behind
me came a furious squeaking and some-
thing beat at my head scratching my
cheek it was a great bat like the one i
had seen hanging to the dead cypress and
another joined it their little eyes blazed
like red fires of hate and the wings that
beat at me were as heavy as a mans arms
they beat me down on my knees in the
mud the howling of the vampire wolves
from the knoll came closer and closer
through the swamp

  without thinking i dug handfuls of
the soft mud at my knees flinging the
slimy stuff into the squeaking faces of
the monster bats it seemed to annoy
them for they squeaked furiously and
darted up out of reach i used the sec-
ond before they swooped back to spring
to my feet and stagger on then they
were on me again their heavy wings bat-
tering at my head the claws on the wings
scratching my face until the blood ran
down onto my neck a great fire-eyed
owl swooped suddenly down and joined
the bats the werewolves were so close
that i saw their dark forms their flaming
eyes and there were other dark shapes
running with them like men but with
eyes that blazed like theirs

  i felt the clinging mud beneath my feet
go thin become water that wet my ankles
i could go no farther the heavy wings
pounded at my head and i slipped and
fell sprawling half choked with slimy
water i lay as i fell lifting my head only
to clear my nose and mouth the water
slowly crawled against my chin too ex-
hausted to get up or even to move or put
my arms over my head to keep off those

terrible wings i waited without hope for
an awful end

  nothing happened the wolves came
dashing up so close that i heard their
panting between yelps and snarling
growls turning over on one elbow i
looked back and wondered there were
the wolves whimpering and slavering
not more than a couple of yards from my
feet and the red-eyed things in the shapes
of men snarled there with them in the
air a half-dozen of the bats whirled and
squeaked and a pair of huge black owls
with fiery eyes like saucers whirled with
them but none of the swooping things
passed over my head none of the whin-
ing pack sprang at me

  suddenly i knew what held them back
years and years before some one had
sunk what was hoped to be an oil well
on this part of the island the well came
in flowing nothing but salt water and
was left there without even the casing
being pulled after all these years a lit-
tle water still flows occasionally from that
old well and seeps through the swamp
to the bayou i lay in water that flowed
however shallow and sluggish-and those
vampires could not cross or enter run-
ning water nor even fly above it

  as long as i lay there i was safe but
i could not lie there until morning sent
the devil pack scampering to its holes
because of gregory i must get back to
him before it was too late i knew that
old well was not far from the fork of the
bayou nearest labranch the things that
whined for my blood could not follow ex-
cept by scampering all the way around
the head of that blessed water perhaps
i could beat them to the bayou bank
well i would try so

  i staggered to my feet shaking my fist
at the things like men and wolves that
yowled their helpless hate at me and at
those other things that hooted and
the last of placides wife



squeaked swooping above them through
the trees

ihad my breath back now was no long-
er weak and panting splashing out
of the water i started for the bayou as
fast as my legs would take me the thirst-
ing things behind me yelped and raced
off to round the old well and so come
at me again god how i ran and
thanked heaven as i ran that there was
not much except solid ground under my
feet so far nor much undergrowth to
slow my pace

   on i went until i began to pant for
breath again hope of reaching the bayou
rose for i knew it could not be much
farther away and i had not yet heard
any more of the howling devils on my
track just as i was about to slow down
and take it easier i heard them again
yelping in the distance but coming like
the rush of wind on i staggered on to
the bayou i could sense the nearness of
the saving stream now two hundred
yards ahead through the darkness  a
hundred   

  silently without warning the bats
swarmed out of the swamp at my back
they came in a cloud great devil owls
with the monster bats swooping beating
again at my head i struggled on on  

  the wolves came up close behind
them padded the things like men with
eyes of fire there were so many that
they were in one anothers way and that
was all that saved me from being torn to
pieces at once the great bats beat me
with their wings and tore at my face with
hooked claws one of the men vampires
seized my wrist this time i knew that
my end had surely come

   it was horrible to die like that and
with the bayou so near-horrible to die
an unclean death from which i would rise
up to be one of those things that howled

for my blood i went mad for a moment
and fought with such fury that i held
them off a little longer screaming as i
fought and then-even in my madness
i heard what it was that made those snarl-
ing things fall bade and stand quivering
listening i had screamed-and the cries
of many men answered from near by in
the swampf

  even while we stood frozen those
fiends and i together points of light
showed faintly moving through the trees
lights-lanterns-and the voices of men

  help i cried this way-help

  again my cry was answered and some
one fired three shots as if they were a sig-
nal farther off the baying of hounds
sounded and three rapid answering
shots

  the things around me all but one of
the werewolves turned and rushed to
meet the men who were running up with
lights the lone beast sprang in to finish
me but i fought so desperately now that
help was near that it could not get at my
throat it knocked me from my feet and
we rolled and fought on the ground i
knew there could be but one end to this
business but shots rang out from close at
hand and yelps and howls mingled with
shouts and curses of men there was
something-something of surprize and
fear and pain-in the howls that made
the beast leave off its slashing at me it
sprang back bristling its red eyes glaring
redder than ever suddenly it let out one
howl of its own and raced to join the
pack

staggering to my feet i saw that a
mad fight was on there among the
trees dark figures blazed away with
guns that spit fire in the murk others
stabbed at wolf and bat and red-eyed
vampires in the shapes of men with
pointed wooden stakes every time a


weird tales

gun roared there would be a shriek of
agony and a bat-thing would fall thud-
ding to the ground a wolf would spring
high into the air yowling its hate or a
thing like a man with blazing eyes would
scream and fall writhing

  but the guns were few and the men
with stakes were not having things all
their own way some of them fell and i
dont like to remember it the vampires
greatly outnumbered the others you un-
derstand but the baying of hounds
came nearer and nearer the dogs them-
selves burst into view furious and eager
to join the fight they rushed in-and
yelped with sudden terror when they
found what things they had to fight here
were creatures no dogs could stand against
the poor beasts turned and fled

  but other men followed the dogs and
two of these had guns that joined the few
already roaring now the odds changed
and suddenly something else happened
except for maybe a dozen that were lying
still on the ground-there were no vam-
pires the bats shot off through the trees
wolves streaked into the bushes the things
that looked like men faded into a gust
of wind that swept away into the swamp

  i stumbled forward and some one
came to meet me it was sheriff desarde

   hey you delacroix he cried whats
happened down here wheres gregory
and the rest of your fellows somebody
had a canteen of water and handed it to
me i gulped half of it down my dry
throat before i started urging the sheriff
toward that knoll where i had left greg-
ory with nita tired as i was i thought
i could guide the sheriff and his men back
over the way i had escaped and i was in
a hurry to go i told desarde what had
taken place in as few words as possible
and we set off at double time

  theyll know were coming and not
all of them were here i warned the
sheriff desarde was confident

  i was in baton rouge this morning
he told me as we went and legendre
-rene legendre is his chief deputy you
understand-didnt know what to do
when gregorys men came in with his
note about old jules landrys disappear-
ance and saying he was going to go into
the swamp and round up the gipsies i
got back to town just before another man
came in from your camp saying you fel-
lows hadnt come back it was seven
oclock then and i knew what had hap-
pened-i was a grown man when placide
duboin married that nita and i know
as much about her as anybody

  i got a gunsmith to jerk the lead out
of enough bullets for a half-dozen guns
and put silver in them instead that
was all we had time to wait for so i gave
the rest of them some poles i had already
sharpened ready to stake out some pole
beans im growing we took them by the
church and wet them plenty in the font
of holy water  i got a pint flask of
holy water on my hip too

  you can believe me i was glad the
sheriff was born in this country and had
more sense about some things than men
who thought they were a lot smarter-
gregory for instance so

we came to the knoll all right and
a lot quicker than i had been in
getting away the place was dark but
we could see red eyes glaring at us out of
the blackness the vampires were there
waiting for us ready to fight for their
nest

  gregory desarde shouted where
are you there was no answer either
then or when the sheriff yelled again
louder we hesitated and desarde called
for all the men with lanterns to bring
them to the front then something swept
down at us and sharp claws raked my
face the sheriff cursed and fired at
the last of placides wife



something that slashed at his own head
it was like a signal the fight was on

  something snarled and rushed at me
there was a lantern on the ground in
back of me and i recognized with satis-
faction the old devil who had brought
me to the knoll in the first place i had
one of the stakes desarde had brought
and it was pointed like a toothpick i
jabbed the old one in the stomach with
it he howled and hopped back but
started for me again

  aho sale vieux i told him you
want a better one i see-well take it
and i drove it at his breast with all my
strength uh-h did you ever drive a
sharp pole into anybodys chest vampire
or otherwise neither did i until then
but you comprehend that it was not nice
   the way he crunched

  wait till i get a drink on that

you- oh very well then you

never pushed a sharp pole into anything
that crunched and squalled

  well that old fellow flopped down
like a bundle of rags i pulled my stake
out of him and jabbed up at a bats stom-
ach it squealed and wheeled away
snarling and growling things fought all
over the place the lanterns on the
ground made just enough light to see a
little some of them were overturned
and broken

  a wolfish shape sprang snarling into
my face i jabbed at it with my pole and
missed and then i was down desardes
gun roared and the loup-garou went limp
on top of me i pushed it off and scram-
bled up the sheriff was blazing away
only whenever he was sure of a hit he
had none of the silver bullets to waste
suddenly the fight died away there was
nothing there for us to fight as before
the vampire pack had melted into the
forest

  now i reminded we find greg-
ory-and nita

  desarde called a half-dozen men to
bring lanterns and told the rest to hurry
and surround the knoll and be on the
lookout for a return of the pack i
rushed to the mound where i had left
nita and gregory the sheriff and the
men with lanterns running with me not
sure of what to expect but in fear that
nita had run into the swamp with her
pack i pushed through the bushes

whatever i thought to find it was
not what the lanterns at my back
showed gregory was on his knees hold-
ing tight to nita who struggled and
fought in his arms like a wild thing
silent panting she clawed at his face
and he hunched his chin tight on her
shoulder to protect himself from her
sharp teeth

  quit fighting gregory pleaded
these are my friends and they wont
hurt you

  let me go fool nita screamed at
him let me go

  why she was not able to fade from
his arms and whisk herself away what
had passed between her and gregory
that may have made her powerless in
his arms i do not know but gregory
held tight to her though she screamed
now and fought like a mad thing de-
sarde brushed past me

  let her loose greg the sheriff
cried-move out of the way and ill
quiet her with a silver bullet

  nita screamed louder the howls of
her pack ranged in closer gregory jerked
his head around at us unmindful that
nita seized the opportunity to bite sav-
agely at his exposed neck

  no he cried in startled alarm shes
mine from now on-ill take care of her
and you wont have to worry about her
now go away and let us alone

  what do you know about that i
thought gregory was playing up to nita


weird tales

so she wouldnt watch me and i could get
away-and he meant it all along he
had actually fallen for that bloodsucking
thing he put his body between her and
desarde and managed to stagger to his
feet with her kicking in his arms

  the sheriff thought gregory was crazy
so did i as far as that goes and i think
so now-no man could take a vampire
in his arms and keep sane desarde was
afraid to fire at nita for fear of hurting
gregory he seemed to have a sudden
idea for i saw him grab at his hip pocket

  lets see what thisll do he mut-
tered pulling out the flask of holy water
i can sprinkle this on both of them

  he slopped the water from the un-
corked bottle on the pair wetting gregory
as much as nita greg started away with
her taking long steps and not seeming
to mind the water but she shrieked and
howled twisting as if desarde had poured
acid on her

  close in the sheriff cried to us
take her away from him and lets fin-
ish this

  gregory heard him and began to run
toward the swamp with nita desarde
started to jump after him then with-
out any warning nitas pack burst onto
the knoll from qut of the woods and hell
broke loose again howling snarling
and squeaking fiends like wolves and bats
and men flung themselves upon us and
between us and the poor fool who car-
ried the mistress of them all

  we were hard pressed for a minute
and two of our men went down and never
got up poor fellows but heavy odds
were with us in point of numbers since
we had killed at least a dozen in the first
two fights and there were still a few
silver bullets in the guns the vampires
gave way and then we realized that they
were really beaten and only fought to
keep us away from gregory and nita

  we punched and jabbed with the
sharpened stakes now and then a gun
blazed whenever a sure shot offered the
blackness of the swamp was beginning
to take on a gray tinge under the threat
of dawn the howls of the things became
uneasy we pushed on after gregory
with less resistance the light grew and
we could see him staggering along ahead
nita sagged limp and dangling in his
arms

  the things swirling around us just
out of reach began to change their snarls
to whimpers two of them ran up to
gregory fluttering around him like two
frightened old women he shook them
off and tottered on on toward the banks
of the bayou that showed through the
grayness not far away

  there was sudden silence around us
for a moment snarls and whimpers
hushed then as if at a signal the vam-
pire pack whirled and raced away behind
us

  understanding flashed through my
brain and it was queer how i felt a little
touch of pity for those things they
could not face the sun and scampered
away to their holes where we would find
them with our stakes before another
night   

  gregory stood swaying facing us with
his back to the bayou we came slowly
closer seeing that his face was drawn
and weary he carried dead weight that
must have felt like lead in his arms nita
hung limp moaning

  get back gregory demanded hoarse-
ly you cant shoot me and i wont
let you touch her im too tired for it
but if you come closer ill jump in the
bayou and try to swim across with her-
if i drown itll be the same as if you
murdered me

  desarde stepped slowly forward emp-
ty hands outstretched intending to try
the last of placides wife



reasoning with him gregory misunder-
stood turned to jump even while the
sheriff cried to him to wait nita jerked
suddenly to life shrieking as she saw
the water under them

  no she screamed for a fraction
of a second while gregory tottered on
the bank she bit and clawed and fought
to tear his arms away desarde ran
toward them and we with him but we
were too late nita gave one last awful
scream of fear as gregory toppled with
her to the water   

  there was a blinding flash a blue-
white sheet of flame that burned up the
air we breathed it burned to the back
of our eyeballs for long minutes we
stood there arms across our eyes blinded
and afraid to move finally that passed
and we could see again but there was
nothing upon the surface of the bayou
the black water flowed on as it always
had creeping darkly toward the bay
what happened or how i dont pretend
to know nor why but all my life ive
heard it said vampires can cross no flow-
ing water gregory had tried to take
nita   and that flame and they were
gone   

  god lets have a drink

    

i am interested in folklore and had lis-
tened to delacroix more for that rea-
son than any odier otherwise i can not
explain why my patience burst bounds
no sooner

  i dont want a drink and youve al-
ready had too many i was angry and
let him have it straight i heard talk in
the town about a wild fight the sheriffs

posse had with a gang of gipsies on the
island and then you waste my time with
a version that would make munchausen
green with envy

  delacroix laughed shortly you dont
expect the people who know the truth to
tell it to outsiders do you and be called
crazy or liars like youre calling me

  anyway i retorted youd better
sober up and be on the job in the morn-
ing if your past record wasnt unusually
good id fir-e you now

  oh delacroix exclaimed innocently
i forgot to tell you when we went back
to the knoll to take care of what was left
to do i hung back and did some private
digging of my own oldplacides money
was there just as nita said   

  reaching into a pocket he drew out
a wallet as he carelessly flipped the con-
tents with his thumb a sheaf of old cur-
rency showed for a minute like the open
corner of a fan the bills were faded and
dirty and their size proved them of old-
fashioned issue old and soiled they may
have been but the four numerals in their
corners seemed very vivid to my startled
eyes

  just a tin box and a little oilskin-
wrapped pack of greenbacks delacroix
observed but big ones so the only
reason im here is because i cant get a
train to new orleans for a couple more
hours   

  you better have a drink before you
go all right whether you do or
whether you dont-he looked up his
grin taking the malice from his parting
shot-you take your job and go hop in
the bayou-and see what happens to
you

   zye of truth

ia fascinating story of a greek who found strange powers in
the ruins of a temple in boeotia

m

essieurs mesdames faites vos
jeuxp

  with a sharp twist of his
right hand the croupier set the roulette
wheel in motion and a moment later he
threw the little ivory ball upon the spin-
ning disk a tense breathless hush fell
upon the circle of well-dressed men and
women seated round the green-covered
table the only sound to be heard was the
merry clicking of the tiny ivory ball as it
leaped and spun in its dance of fortune

  gradually the wheel slowed down
until the alternating red and black sec-
tions could be faintly distinguished-
slower still until one could see the blur
of the numbers on the outer rim of white
-slower and slower until the eye could
follow the tiny white ball as it circled
round in one of the black sections of the
wheel and read the number marked upon
the rim

dx noir pair et manque an-
nounced the droning voice of the croupier

  for a few seconds he plied his rake
deftly whisked away the stakes of those
who had lost pushing their winnings
across to those on whom fortune had
smiled

  the count wins again whispered
one woman to her neighbor ma foi
but he has the luck of le grand diable
himself

  the other woman sighed enviously as
she watched her few notes go to swell
the great pile opposite the man referred to

  ah but he is one who has the cour-
age to flout dame fortune by turning his


back on her while she smiles upon him
see-he is about to leave the table

  vraiment he can well afford to be
content exclaimed the first speaker
tonight he has won a fortune

  last night he did the same--and the
night before too many times have i
watched him tempted to follow his play
yet fearing that such luck can not hold
but it does hold tenez it is beyond be-
lief who is he

  the other woman raised her pencilled
eyebrows and shrugged

  ah many people have asked that
question without finding an answer to it
the man is a mystery nobody knows
his name so the habitues of the tables have
invented one for him they call him
count roulette

  meanwhile the object of their conver-
sation had risen leisurely to his feet swept
together his winnings and thrust them
carelessly into his pocket he was a tall
and extremely handsome man although
well past the prime of life if one might
judge by the snowy whiteness of his hair
and the long pointed beard which covered
the lower portion of his face yet his
skin though pale as old ivory showed
scarcely a trace of a wrinkle while his
dark eyes shone beneath their heavy
brows with a keen vivacity that seemed
almost youthful

  the moment he rose there was a rush
of bystanders to occupy the lucky chair
but he did not even glance toward them
as he crossed to the door leading to the
atrium where all hats and coats must be
the eye of truth



deposited before he could reach it his
arm was seized violently from behind

  pardon monsieur the speaker a to-
tal stranger to him was quivering with
eagerness and excitement you play on
a system-yes i will pay your own price
for the secret of it

  the man who had won a fortune
paused and regarded the other for a mo-
ment through the old-fashioned glass
which he usually wore suspended from
his neck by a fine gold chain

  i have no system monsieurhe said
coldly his french was perfect but he
spoke it with a slight intonation which

seemed to indicate it was not his native
tongue

the mans grip tightened on his arm
no system he whispered in a voice
of hoarse incredulity yet you win and

win and win-

  true monsieur for the first time
that evening a faint smile lightened the
habitual sadness of the bearded mans
face i win because-unfortunately-i
can not lose i have the honor of wishing
you good-night-and better fortune

  he released his arm with a quick move-
ment and before the other could recover
from his astonishment passed through


weird tales

the swinging doors into the vestibule
tendering his numbered vestaire check he
received his hat and overcoat and as the
attendant was helping him to don the lat-
ter one of the frock-coated officials ap-
proached and whispered in his ear

  would it not be well if a gendarme
accompanies monsieur to his hotel the
hour is late and you have a large sum
of money in your possession and there
have been instances where players have

been robbed of their winnings-

  pray have no fear interrupted the
count i have a    a friend not far
away

  as monsieur pleases

the official returned to his post in the
gaming-room and the other stepped
out into the palm-shaded path that led
through the gardens of the casino as
he disappeared two men who had quit-
ted the tables a few seconds before him
emerged from the shadows and followed
noiselessly in his wake

  stepping out briskly and inhaling with
evident relief the cool sea breeze which
swept in from the mediterranean-
doubly refreshing after the vitiated scent-
laden atmosphere of the crowded gaming-
rooms-the stranger soon reached the
curving terrace overlooking the pointe
focianana here he came to a halt and
lighting a cigar leant his arms on the
stone balustrade and contemplated the
scene before him

  immediately below was the little square
harbor with its twin lighthouses guard-
ing the entrance their lights red on one
side and green on the other mirrored
with scarcely a break in the smooth un-
ruffled waters beyond the harbor tow-
ered the fortress-crowned rock of mo-
naco ancient grim rugged and gray its
siege-scarred walls and bastions looking
down as though in savage contempt at the

ultra-modern casino which glittering
with a thousand lights and looking as
dainty as the white ornament on a bridal
cake faced it across the bay

  a faint crunching sound on the gravel
path behind him caused him to swing
round confronting him their faces con-
cealed by masks were two men the fore-
most holding a revolver aimed straight at
his breast

  your money monsieur or you die
the man with the white beard leaned
back against the balustrade and laughed
softly

  pardon my mirth messieurs but one
would imagine that you had studied
your-er-profession at some opera

bouffe-

  the right hand of the threatened man
made a quick movement toward his
breast but it was merely to grasp the
curious eyeglass which dangled on its gold
chain raising it to his eye he surveyed
each man in turn as coolly and dispassion-
ately as though he were inspecting two
rare specimens in a museum so unex-
pected was that calm scrutiny that the
man with the pistol shrank back and
stood irresolute but the other came for-
ward with a muttered curse

  nom de dieu why do you waste time
put a bullet into the old cochon if he

wont hand over-

  again the man with the white beard
laughed

  your threats are empty messieurs as
empty as the weapon you threaten me
with your revolver is not loaded

  the two men stared at the speaker for
an instant in speechless amazement

  you are surprized that i know that
the old man continued but there are
many more things about you that i know
equally well you-he pointed to the
man who held the revolver-are raoul
lecontier otherwise known as le lapin
the eye of truth



an apache badly wanted by the surete
generate of paris for the murder of the
baker in the rue du petit camas your
companion is anton grezan otherwise
known as-

  mille tonnerres you know too much
old man to be allowed to live money or
no money he mustnt get away from
here

  pocketing his empty pistol the ruffian
slid a knife from his belt and slowly and
cautiously the two began to approach their
victim but the old man had no inten-
tion of allowing himself to be cornered
throwing his hat in the face of the fore-
most man he dashed off to the right and
tore along a path which stretched dim
beneath the arching palms and sub-trop-
ical undergrowth his assailants in hot
pursuit	

  help he cried raising his voice and
speaking in english help me i am
beset by thieves

  with a promptitude that couid scarcely
have been excelled had the summons been
awaited a figure rose from one of the
stone seats and placed itself in fighting
attitude between pursued and pursuers
for an instant the two apaches paused
then with bared knives held ready for
the deadly upward lunge they circled
round to attack the newcomer from both
sides simultaneously

  but the man was evidently fully alive
to the importance of getting his attack in
first instead of making a retreat before
such odds he sidestepped quickly and
with the force and dexterity of a trained
boxer sent a lightning right and left to
the jaw of the nearest man

   youre down for the count anyway
my beauty he muttered as the french-
man sagged forward and pitched head-
long on to the gravel his knife falling
from his hand giving the weapon a
kick which sent it slithering well out of

reach the victor turned his attention to
the remaining man but this time he
waited for his opponents move

  it was not long in coming

  mort de dieu screamed le lapin
springing forward with upraised knife
dog of an englishman-you die

  not on your life monsieur came
back with a mocking laugh

  what happened subsequently was en-
tirely beyond the apaches experiences of
such encounters the vague impression
he retained in his mind was that his in-
tended victim was in two places at once
but before he had time to give this extraor-
dinary phenomenon due attention a fist
shot out of nowhere in particular and
landed with the force of a battering-ram
behind his left ear in what was-although
the recipient knew it not-a very scien-
tific and perfect cross counter

  two said the victor as the gallant
lapin went to join his prostrate accom-
plice and now i should be glad to
know what all the fuss is about

  the white-bearded man who load been
an interested spectator of the fight now
stepped forward

  these two gentlemen very kindly of-
fered to relieve me of a few thousand
francs that i had won at the tables he
said with a slight smile when i de-
clined to allow them to act as my bankers
they tried to kill me

  shall i hand them over to the po-
lice asked the young man

  the other surveyed the limp forms of
his late antagonists then shook his head

  i think they have learnt their lesson
not to molest inoffensive strangers i will
drop a hint in the right quarter to insure
that monte carlo becomes too hot to hold
them another twenty-four hours really
he paused and regarded his rescuer
through his strange eyeglass i am rather
grateful to the rogues since they have


weird tales

been the means of my becoming ac-
quainted with a young artist whom i have
long wished to know

  meaning myself the surprize in
the young mans voice was too deep to be
disguised

  exactly as a matter of fact i ran
down this rather dark and forbidding path
well knowing that i should find you
seated at the farther end and i may add
well knowing too that you would not fail
me in my hour of need

  the other gave a laugh of frank in-
credulity

  your good opinion of me is very flat-
tering sir but i fear you must be mis-
taken how could you have foreseen that
i should be in the casino gardens at this
hour of the night why im positive that
i have spoken to no one of my intention
to come here in fact i did not make up
my mind to do so until--

   exactly a quarter past five this after-
noon when you were packing up your
paints and easel after completing your
picture of the distant citadel of monaco

they had fallen into step together and
had been walking along the avenue
which runs parallel to the quai de plais-
ance but as the older man made this
extraordinary remark the young artist
stopped dead and stared at him in amaze-
ment

  how could you possibly have known
what was in my thoughts he cried

  the other shrugged slightly and a
wistful smile rose to his bearded lips

  i am a man who knows many things
that are hidden in the hearts of others he
said slowly though it is doubtful whether
i am to be envied my knowledge for
instance although you are living in an
obscure lodging in the unfashionable
quarter of the town i know that you are

frank hartley the only son of matthew
hartley the millionaire oil-king

  quite correct the young man admit-
ted but such information might have
been gained by a few discreet inquiries i
must have more convincing proof than
that if i am to believe in your boasted
omniscience tell me for instance the
most important thing that i intend to do
tomorrow

  the old man raised his eyeglass to his
eye and favored frank hartley with a
long stare

  the most important thing that you in-
tend to do tomorrow mr hartley-al-
though you have not yet quite made up
your mind to take the plunge-is to ask
lady vanda delafer to become your
wife

  the statement seemed to strike the
young man speechless for a moment he
stood rigid and motionless with sheer
amazement and the other went on

  if an old man may offer a little ad-
vice to one younger than himself i would
counsel you to beware of putting too
much trust in new-found friends-no
matter how beautiful and fascinating
remember that although your father has
disinherited you because you chose to fol-
low art instead of leading the idle useless
life of a fashionable man about town-
remember i repeat that he may relent
before he dies and frank hartley heir to
the hartley millions may succeed in love
where frank hartley as the penniless ar-
tist would be rejected with scorn

  hartley started forward and seized the
old mans shoulder

  who are you he demanded fiercely
men call me count roulette and
that name will serve as well as any other
the unknown answered with a shrug
my home is that large steam yacht the
veritas which you can see moored at the
quay yonder as for my occupation-
the eye of truth



well i can only describe myself as a
seeker

  a seeker frank repeated wondering-
ly what do you seek then is it love
-fame-riches

  with a slow inscrutable smile count
roulette shook his head

   i seek none of those things my friend
but rather a thing that one might imagine
to be much easier to find yet i find my
quest strangely difficult-so difficult in-
deed that until this night i have almost
despaired of accomplishing it but now

i have hopes- he paused and with

a slow impressive movement raised to his
eye the curious eyeglass which dangled on
its gold chain intently scrutinizing the
young mans features as he muttered to
himself yes most decidedly i have
hopes-now

   then dropping the glass he raised his
hat with a courtly old-fashioned bow and
hurried away walking with rapid strides
down the inclined road which led to the
harbor

  frank hartley watched him until he
turned the corner a puzzled frown on his
rather handsome features

  he must be crazed-obsessed by a fan-
tastic quest he muttered as he turned
away yet the poor old fellow looked

so kindly - so intelligent- he

started suddenly as his thoughts flew back
to the old mans strange words but
all the same its mighty queer how he
came by his knowledge of my private af-
fairs and was able to guess my intentions
regarding lady vanda yes its very
queer  i wonder   

  he pondered deeply over the problem
as he made his way through the silent
streets to his lodging in the older and less
fashionable district known as la conda-
mine but when he fell asleep that night
he had advanced no farther toward the
solution of the mystery which surrounded

the strange white-bearded man whose
amazing luck had gained for him the title
of count roulette

in the daintily decorated breakfast room
of a suite de luxe in the most exclusive
and expensive hotel in monte carlo two
people were seated the following morning
neither of them seemed to have much ap-
petite for the breakfast which the waiter
had just set out on the table in the window
overlooking the sea the girl a strikingly
handsome blond attired in a wrapper of
coral-pink silk was puffing at a per-
fumed cigarette while she manipulated a
cocktail-shaker with the facility of an
expert

  there was a strong facial likeness be-
tween her and the man who was lounging
on the settee glancing through a conti-
nental edition of an english newspaper-
a likeness which was rendered even more
striking by his effeminate air drawling
utterance and languid movements

  the honorable bobby delafer was two
years older than his sister vanda but
hers was the dominating will and in the
not infrequent discussions as to the best
ways and means of what in less exalted
society is termed raising the wind hers
was the casting vote which decided their
tactics for although the ancestral heads
of the house of delafer had bequeathed
to their descendants an ancient and-out-
wardly at least-unsullied title there had
been no fat rent-roll accompanying it

  the present lord delafer the tenth of
his line had early in his career evinced a
partiality for high stakes at cards and this
taste combined with a certain novel and
dexterous method of manipulating them
had caused him to resign his commission
in a crack cavalry regiment at the urgent
and very caustic request of his command-
ing officer at the present time he was
drawing a very modest and precarious in-


weird tales

come by allowing his name to figure on
the lists of directors of sundry newly
fledged mining companies to his two
offspring he had given his fatherly advice
and blessing before launching them on the
sea of life to trim their sails by such
favoring winds as fate might send in the
hope of berthing in the snug and secure
haven of a rich marriage

  to the honorable bobby this much-de-
sired consummation seemed as far off as
ever the enterprising vanda however
had at one time seemed to maintain the
nautical simile almost on the point of
hooking her anchor firmly in the golden
shoals accumulated by old matthew hart-
ley with infinite patience she had cul-
tivated the acquaintance of his only son
frank even going to the length of taking
lessons in art-a thing she heartily de-
tested to the generous and unsuspicious
young student she appeared like a kindred
soul friendship ripened quickly into
that camaradarie which prevails in the stu-
dios and that in turn ripened - on
franks part at least-to a deep and abid-
ing love then with the prize almost
within her grasp came the bombshell
which shattered her hopes quite cas-
ually as though it were a thing of but
little importance frank happened to men-
tion that his father had quarrelled with
him because he had chosen to become an
artist and that his hopes of inheriting the
bulk of the old mans millions were very
slender

  frank had been considerably puzzled
by her sudden and unaccountable coolness
toward him but little did he realize the
real reason for it indifferent to wealth
himself he credited the adorable vanda
with a like disinterestedness he might
have seen fit to revise his opinion of that
lady had he seen her that morning as she
filled two tall glasses with the fog-colored

liquor from the shaker and raised one of
them in a sardonic toast

  heres to our next venture bobby-
and may it prove a more profitable stunt
than angling for a paint-slinging fool of
a pauper

  the honorable bobby shook his head
slightly as he sipped his cocktail

  not quite a pauper vanda he cor-
rected he has a bit of an income-

  yes-enough to pay my hair-dressing
and beauty-parlor bills there was a
sneer of her carmined lips that revealed
little cruel lines at the corners of her
mouth no im afraid the dear inno-
cent frank hartley is a back number as far
as i am concerned i might have been
able to tolerate him as a husband with a
million or two to burn but hed drive me
crazy as a love-in-a-cottage partner ill
write to him this morning and tell him
that im through-that im wedded to
my art-like he is the poor fish

   bobby who had been listlessly glancing
down the columns of the paper now
looked up with a sudden exclamation

hold on my dear youre travelling
a bit too rapid id leave that note unwrit-
ten for a day or two if i were you
why she demanded harshly if
you imagine for a moment that im going

to waste my chances on-

  waste nothing he jerked out sharp-
ly just read that

  he laid the paper before her and
pointed to a paragraph half-way down the
middle page

  vanda snatched up the paper and hast-
ily scanned the headline her breast rising
and falling rapidly her hands trembling
with an excitement which she did not at-
tempt to control

millionaire dies intestate
dramatic collapse of
mr matthew hartley in office
search for missing heir
the eye of truth

j

  the actual report was brief merely in-
timating that the well-known oil magnate
had died of a heart attack while attend-
ing to his private correspondence in his
london office then followed the usual
outline of the dead mans career with a
list of the various companies and com-
bines in which he had held a controlling
interest it was the final paragraph which
caused a wave of wild elation to mount to
vanda delafers brain

   the solicitors of the late mr hartley have made
known the extraordinary news that the dead mil-
lionaire has left no will in which case it is to be
presumed that the whole of his immense fortune
will devolve on his only son although his actual
whereabouts is at present unknown mr frank
hartley is believed to be travelling on the con-
tinent inquiries are being set on foot and he is
requested to communicate without delay with
messrs harrow and brett solicitors of grays inn
square london

she tossed the paper aside and sprang
to her feet her eyes shining her sharp
white teeth showing in a smile of triumph

so frank will be rich after all she
cried and i was about to give him up
her brother shrugged his narrow shoul-
ders as he gave a smile of conscious supe-
riority

  your impulsiveness will be your ruin
one of these days my dear sister he
drawled lucky for you that you have
me to give you a little brotherly guidance
now and then if it had not been for me
you would have let that poor fish wriggle
off the hook after having played him so
patiently

  no fear of that happening-now
the grating laugh which accompanied her
words seemed strangely at variance with
her delicate beauty im willing to bet
that ill be murmuring a coy yes to his
proposal some time today

  the honorable bobby favored his sister
with an approving grin

  leave it until the shades of evening
are softly falling-he will feel more ro-

mantic then he advised with the certi-
tude of an adept in such matters but
for heavens sake dont let him know
youve seen that report of his fathers
death

  vanda received his advice as though it
were a personal affront

  think i was born yesterday she
asked in a tone of acid reproof leave
it to me boy i reckon theres no flies on
your little sister when it comes to vamp-
ing a simp like that

  a discreet tap on the door interrupted
their conversation at this stage and a mo-
ment later one of the hotel valets made
his appearance

  a young lady wishes to speak with
madame he said

  oh yes show her up vanda turned
to her brother with a little laugh when the
man had gone ive got a surprize for
you bobby you never suspected that i
was a perfect unknown genius of an ar-
tist did you well i am--or perhaps i
should say im going to be one

  good lord bobby gasped in sur-
prize why the only thing ive ever
seen you paint is your face

  dont be horrid or i shant tell you
how clever ive been you know how
frank absolutely raves over anything con-
nected with art well im going to paint
some lovely pictures for him to gloat
over

  bobby shook his head with a puzzled
air i cant imagine you painting any-
thing that frank hartley is likely to gloat
over

  you foolish boy im not going to
paint them myself-im going to pose as
a genius by proxy i saw a girl making
sketches on the corniche road yesterday
-just the style of thing that frank raves
about-so i arranged to buy a few of her
pictures so as to pass them off as my own
work--


weird tales

   but its rather risky supposing-

  hush here she is

  the girl who entered was slim and
dark and of such remarkable beauty that
even the blase bobby stared here was a
face almost madonna-like in its serene
purity with a clear complexion that had
been toned and ripened to rich damask
coloring by long hours in the open air
and with steady blue-gray eyes which
looked so transparently sincere al-
though she might have passed for a girl
still in her teens mary deane was twenty-
one and her short experience of the
world had not been free either from
struggle or hardship adversity might
have robbed her of the illusions of youth
but in their place it had given her poise
and a dogged confidence in her own abil-
ity to win through

  ah good morning miss deane
vandas tone was slightly more gracious
than that which she used when addressing
her maid you have brought the
sketches i see

  yes and i have also brought the one
i was working on when you spoke to me
yesterday

  mary deane opened the leather port-
folio and took out four pictures and laid
them on the table bobby uttered a
sound which was intended to express ad-
miration

  by jove ive never seen anything i
like better his gaze was not on the pic-
tures as he spoke i could sit here and
feast my eyes for hours on such beauty
the girl made a slight inclination of
her head

  it is indeed a pleasure to meet such
an ardent admirer-of coast scenery she
said in a voice which betrayed a slight
tinge of irony there are so many other
attractions in monte carlo that to many
visitors the natural beauties pass almost
unnoticed

  catching her brothers eye vanda gave
him a warning frown as he was about to
launch into another enthusiastic pan-
egyric

  im rather glad that you do not sign
your work was her own highly prac-
tical remark personally i think its
much nicer to have unsigned pictures
hanging on the walls-unless of course
they are by well-known artists-and after
all it is the painting itself not the signa-
ture that matters

  the ghost of a smile touched the lips of
mary deane as she listened hard and
practical experience had taught her dif-
ferent and often in the past she had seen
a mediocre work bearing the signature
of a well-known r a eagerly snapped
up while a better work by an unknown
artist had failed to find a buyer

  undoubtedly a famous name has its
value she contented herself with re-
marking but i fear that your ladyship
is mistaken in assuming that my pictures
are quite unsigned if you look very
closely in the corner of each picture you
will see a tiny monogram m d my own
initials

  by jove sounds quite doctorish -
what broke in bobby

  vanda delafers brows met in a frown
of annoyance as she bent over the pic-
tures carefully examining the spot indi-
cated by the young artist at last she
shook her head

  i can not see the monogram she said

  it is very difficult to make out mary
explained for instance in this picture
it is composed of the stems of the clump
of grass in the foreground in this it is
markings on the fragment of rock it is
a queer little notion of my own to mark
my pictures in this way mary deane
went on with a smile a sort of a com-
promise between a signed picture and an
unsigned one i suppose i must have just

                    w t-
the eye of truth



sufficient of the artistic temperament to
prevent me writing my name in full and
just too little to allow me to leave it out
altogether

  vanda took another long look and a
sigh of relief escaped her lips

   but it is quite unnoticeable unless one
looked for the monogram she said

  oh quite

   then it really does not matter whether
it is there or not she placed the pictures
together and crossed to the bureau in the
comer of the room i will buy the four
pictures miss deane i think you said
you valued them at ten guineas each
very well i will write you out a check
now

  she seated herself at the bureau took
up a pen and then started to search fran-
tically pulling out the drawers and rum-
maging among the littered papers

   dear me wherever could i have put
my check-book one of those careless
maids must have mislaid it she turned
to the girl with a charming smile of
apology ill have to send the check on
to you after all will you just scribble
the address where you are staying so that
i can send the money on to you when my
check-book turns up its frightfully an-
noying but i hope you wont mind the
slight delay

   not in the least lady delafer

  mary deane wrote down the address
and vanda dismissed her with a gracious
smile and the assurance that she would
receive the check by the first available
post

   dear little trustful soul said bobby
after the door had closed on the unsus-
picious girl where does she hang out

  he craned forward to read the address
but his sister quickly snatched it away

  youll please keep out of this little
business bobby she said sharply if
maxy deane is trustful now she wouldnt
w t-

be trustful long after you had started

amusing yourself with her

  the honorable bobby scowled sulkily
as he lit a cigarette

  all right but it certainly amuses me
to hear you moralizing my dear vanda
he answered with a sneer how long
do you think she would have trusted you
if youd written out that check i know
the amount is only  but your present
bank balance is something of a minus
quantity

  there was a derisive smile on lady
vandas painted lips and a light of sly
triumph glinted between her heavy eye-
lids

  have no fear of that my dear bobby
she said calmly there will be plenty of
money in the bank to meet that check
when it is presented from now onward
nothing can mar my plans i am de-
termined that i shall be frank hartleys
wife within a month and i defy the devil

himself to prevent me-

  bobbys warning cry caused her to
swing round her confident boast ended
in a low gasp of dismay

  framed in the open doorway still and
silent as a granite sphinx as he stood re-
garding her through a quaint old-
fashioned eyeglass was the mysterious
man known as count roulette

for nearly a minute there was silence
in the dainty room silence that was
broken only by the ticking of the gilt
clock on the mantelpiece and the quick
breathing of the startled girl then with
an ugly oath bobby sprang to his feet and
advanced toward the intruder

  what do you mean by sneaking in
here like that he demanded furiously
this is a private suite-not the smoke-
room

  count roulette dropped his eyeglass


weird tales

and bent his head in a little deferential
bow

  i must beg of you to forgive a foolish
old man for his unintentional intrusion
he said in perfect english as some
slight excuse for my offense i may men-
tion the fact that i knocked twice before
entering but unfortunately i mistook
lady vandas somewhat loudly voiced re-
marks for an invitation to enter

  what do you want anyway que-
ried bobby eyeing him with a suspicious
scowl

  i came here in the hope of meeting
mr frank hartley

  are you a friend of his vanda
asked quickly

  the count made a gesture of polite
deprecation as he shook his head

  i can scarcely claim to be that lady
vanda i spoke to him for the first time
last night

  vanda heaved a long sigh of relief
the man was a mere casual acquaintance
and it was hardly likely that frank would
have told him about his private affairs
she hastened to switch the conversation
into a different channel

  i have heard about your sensational
winnings at the tables count-indeed
who has not done so she said with a
dazzling smile were you equally lucky
last night

  the old mans fingers strayed toward
the dangling eyeglass as he nodded
gravely

  yes mademoiselle i was indeed for-
tunate

  did you break the bank bobby
asked eagerly

  the count spread his hands at the
same time giving a humorous lift of his
eyebrows

  helas in these days one can do noth-
ing so sensational as break the bank for
when the croupier of one table finds his

funds are running low he quietly sends
to one of the other tables for more money
still i have no reason to complain of my
fortune last night

  id give a good deal to know the sys-
tem that you play on count said vanda
shooting a keen glance at his impassive
face they say you have a marvelous
flair for the exact moment to begin your
play

  again that slow smile broke the sphinx-
like calm of the old mans features

  more important than that my dear
lady vanda i know the right moment
when the game gets too difficult to play
with safety-a knowledge which is of
value in even more risky pastimes than
roulette

  lightly as the words were spoken lady
vanda sensed a subtle note of warning
underlying them for an instant she felt
a strange and unreasoning fear of this
soft-spoken man with the bright yet in-
scrutable eyes but she dismissed the pass-
ing presentiment with a careless laugh

  really my dear count you are so
sure of your knowledge of the future that
im tempted to think you must have deal-
ings in the black art she said with a
faint sneer you speak with all the con-
fidence of an ancient oracle

  your ladyship may regard me as one
if the idea affords any amusement again
that baffling smile touched his lips as he
added an oracle of ancient greece
with a sudden start the suspicion
flashed over her that the old man was
merely talking to gain time until frank
hartley should arrive her smile was
sweeter than ever as she rose to her feet
to end the interview

  just at present im too frightfully busy
to consult oracles of any description she
said extending her hand must you
really be going now

  the hint was too pointed to be ignored
the eye of truth



count roulette took the proffered hand
and for an instant his dark eyes looked
straight into hers

  au revoir lady vanda delafer he
said slowly my stay in monte carlo is
likely to be a short one but something-
call it my prophetic instinct if you like-
tells me that we shali meet again

  with a little bow and a parting glance
through his eyeglass he took his depar-
ture for nearly a minute lady vanda
stood motionless staring at the closed
door with eyes which had of a sudden
become filled with dread then with a low
sob she sank into her chair

  who is that man-what is he she
asked in a horse whisper i loathe him
yet i fear him even more and when he
looked at me through that eyeglass i felt
as if ail the secrets of my innermost soul
were lying bare before him i believe he
is the devil himself

  in that case you should find him high-
ly congenial company bobby answered
with a grin but as a matter of fact i
suppose the fellow is nothing more than
one of the usual crowd of dubious foreign
counts that one meets in a place like this
he has gained a sort of cheap notoriety by
a few fortunate runs at the tables but
wait till his luck changes-as it must do
sooner or later-and youll see him van-
ish--like that

  and the honorable bobby blew a cloud
of cigarette smoke into the air

when some two hours later frank
called at the hotel he found vanda
attired in an artists overall and apparent-
ly in he act of cleaning her palette

  what at work so early he cried in
surprize you positively put me to
shame-i havent touched a brush for
nearly a week lets have a look at the
picture

  vanda lifted her shoulders in a shrug

of affected indifference

  oh its nothing much-just a sketch
i dashed off a few days ago i really did
not intend you to see it for i just dread
having my poor amateur efforts criticized
please let me hide it away in merciful
oblivion and she made a movement as
if she were about to cover it up

  greatly to her disappointment he made
no effort to prevent her as you please
vanda was all he said i have no
wish to pry into matters that you would
rather i did not

  she turned her eyes on him with a
look of laughing dismay

  really my dear frank that remark
sounded frightfully mysterious-any one
would imagine that i had all sorts of
grisly skeletons in my cupboards i sup-
pose i must show it to you now if only
to convince you that theres nothing sinis-
ter about my poor daub if you promise
you wont be too scathing in your com-
ments ill let you have one little peep
there she placed the sketch that mary
deane had sold her on the easel so that
the light fell upon it to the best effect
as shakespeare says somewhere or other
a poor thing but mine own

  with a tolerant smile frank turned to
look but as his eyes fell upon the picture
his expression changed to a look of de-
lighted wonder

  by jove vanda this is simply won-
derful he cried in a tone of genuine ad-
miration i had no idea that you could
turn out such clever and distinctive work
vanda raised her brows with an
expression of artless surprize

  then you dont think it so very bad
frank

  bad he cried catching her hands in
his strong grasp and drawing her to him
i only wish that i could paint half as
well have you any more sketches that


weird tales

you have dashed off as you so modestly
call it

  oh ive kept a few she answered
carelessly and without a tremor or a blush
she took out the other three sketches of
mary deanes and laid them before him
its a wonder that i did not destroy
these as i have the rest of my work i
had no idea that they were really good
why you dear little unassuming
genius every one of them is a master-
piece frank exclaimed with a boyish
laugh after we are married i must get

you to give me some lessons-

  married oh frank do you really
mean that without waiting for an
answer she flung her arms round his neck
and kissed him passionately you have
made me the happiest girl in all the
world

  for a moment he stared at her stupidly
the words had been spoken unconscious-
ly his thoughts more on the glorious
colorings of the pictured scenes than on
vanda herself he would have recalled
them had it been possible but as it was
there was only one thing that he could do

  of course i meant it vanda he said
gently yet in a voice that he knew was
strangely lacking in warmth i have
always liked you but now that there is
another bond between us your wonder-
ful art-

  with a little playful laugh she put her
hand on his mouth

  for today lets forget all about those
old pictures she begged i shall get
quite jealous of them if you persist in
singing their praises and if i once get the
idea that you think more of them than you
do of me i declare i shall never paint
another one again tell me that you love
me for myself

  smiling down at the blue eyes which
looked into his so appealingly frank gave
her the assurance she asked for yet

even as he spoke the words his eyes wan-
dered from the throbbing form he held in
his arms to the glowing colors of the pic-
ture on the easel and in his secret heart
he knew that he lied and lady vanda
flushed with triumph though she was
felt a pang of bitter resentment as she
realized that the real inspirer of franks
love was the genius of mary deane the
girl whose pictures she had claimed as her
own

it must be admitted that frank and
lady vanda looked a handsome and
well-matched couple as they passed
through the hotel foyer and into the
sunny street and their smiling and appar-
ently happy faces drew many an envious
glance from the wrinkled dowagers and
flabby bilious-looking old gentlemen who
seemed to make up the greater part of the
residents

  the moment they reached the sidewalk
frank was aware of a familiar figure hur-
rying across the square toward them

  i want to introduce you to a new
friend vanda he said he is a strange
man and i met him under strange circum-
stances and i can not help thinking that
in some way or other he is going to have
a great influence in my life

  vandas eyes grew hard as she recog-
nized the object of his words

  you mean count roulette if so
then your introduction comes somewhat
late the count and i have met before
before frank could voice his surprize
at this unexpected piece of information
the count was by their side

  well met tnes amis he cried raising
his broad-brimmed hat with a gesture
which might have seemed exaggerated
had it been less graceful i seemed to
have a premonition that i should encoun-
ter you as you came out either to enjoy a
walk in the morning air or to woo the
fickle goddess of chance
the eye of truth



  lady vandas fair eyebrows were lifted
in genuine surprize as she turned to the
count surely you must be aware that
the casino is not open so early in the
day

  truly mademoiselle but there are
other ways of gambling at monte besides
roulette or trente-et-quarante

  he pointed to the farther side of the
square where an old man was walking up
and down displaying a large printed plac-
ard and at the same time calling out
loterie loterie every now and then
one of the passers-by would approach him
tender a coin and receive in exchange a
pink ticket torn from the book he held in
his hand

  the state lottery is the only form of
gambling in which the native mone-
gasques are allowed to indulge for the
authorities very wisely exclude their own
citizens from the gaming-rooms count
roulette explained his eyeglass focused
on the old ticket-seller then he added with
a smile now is your opportunity to make
a little speculation although he does
not know it that shabby old man is at
the present moment holding in his hand
the ticket which will win  francs
when the result of the draw is made pub-
lic today the winning check is number
lf  and it is the fourth ticket in
the book he is holding in his hand

  a smile of amused contempt came over
vandas features as she listened

  surely you do not expect me to be-
lieve that you can tell the winning num-
ber beforehand she cried

  oh no mademoiselle i do not in
the least expect you to believe such an ap-
parent absurdity the counts tone was
gently apologetic yet it is a fact never-
theless if you would like to be the richer
by  francs before tonight i would
advise you to buy the check numbered
lf  before it is sold to some one

else it is now the third ticket from the
top for he has sold one since i last
spoke

  you must be joking count she
cried such a thing is unheard of
count roulette shrugged slightly
alas mademoiselle it is only the un-
heard-of things which excite our interest
in the present age of scientific marvels
he turned his head and threw a lightning
glance at lady vandas chauffeur who
was listening eagerly to the conversation
but you will have to hurry if you wish to
secure the winning ticket it is now the
second in the old mans book

  ive a good mind to take your tip
frank cried its a chance anyway
alas my dear friend it is a chance
which you have lost said the count
shaking his head and pointing to the
chauffeur who was hurrying across the
road in the direction of the ticket-seller
see the enterprising jules has fore-
stalled you he has already bought the
ticket that will win what to him will mean
a fortune

  lucky jules vanda laughed mock-
ingly

  there was a strange expression on the
counts face as he raised his eyeglass and
through it watched the chauffeur as he
climbed into the driving-seat of lady
vandas high-powered car

  lucky he repeated softly lucky  
we shall see

  for a while they chatted on different
subjects until vanda glanced at the tiny
watch she wore on her wrist and uttered
an exclamation of surprize

  i hope you wont think me a flatterer
when i say that time passes very quickly
in your company count she cried gayly
we must really be going now as we
have arranged to have a run to nice by
way of the corniche road i have never


weird tales

been by car before and they say the
scenery is wonderful

  nice there was a far-away expres-
sion in the old mans dark eyes as he re-
peated the word i am rather interested
in that town not because of its fashion-
able hotels and expensive shops but be-
cause it was one of the places where my
ancestors the ancient greeks overcame
the aboriginal inhabitants and built their
acropolis on the great rock which over-
hangs the little cove of les ponchettes
and in it set up a great statue of nike the
winged goddess of victory it is from
that almost forgotten goddess nike that
the modern name of the town nice is
derived

  indeed she murmured politely sup-
pressing a yawn with difficulty you
must be frightfully clever to know all
about such dead-and-done-with events

  count roulette shook his head and
almost unconsciously his fingers strayed
to the eyeglass which dangled from its
gold chain

   dead-and-done-with is a very apt
description my dear lady vanda he re-
plied quietly yet who shall say how
little or how much we moderns owe to
the sages and philosophers of the ancient
civilizations which have preceded us into
the eternal night he broke off abrupt-
ly with a little laugh of apology but i
fear i shall get the name of a bad com-
panion if i indulge in such speculations
on such a delightful morning as this-
one should keep gloomy thoughts for
gloomy weather and tell ghost tales only
when the snow is on the ground and the
wind moans in the chimney as is your
english custom i do not think i could
do better than follow your example and
take a run in my car along the corniche
road as far as nice

  disregarding vandas warning frown

frank turned as he was about to enter the

car

  why not accompany us count
theres plenty of room and i should wel-
come your company

  for a second it seemed as if count
roulette was on the point of accepting
but after raising his glass to his eye and
glancing at the chauffeur he shook his
head

  i would prefer to use my own car for
the journey there and back however i
trust you will do me the honor of lunch-
ing with me at the negresco at nice
you will good then au revoit till we
meet there i will phone the maitre dho-
tel to reserve a private room for i may
possibly have something to tell you of a
rather confidential nature

  with a sweep of his broad-brimmed
hat count roulette turned away and hur-
ried off in the direction of the quay
franks eyes followed the tall figure until
it was lost to sight amid the fashionably
dressed crowd then vaguely uneasy he
turned to the waiting jules and motioned
to him to start the car on its journey along
the corniche road

although visitors to the riviera are
b accustomed to speak of the cor-
niche road there are strictly speaking
no less than three highways that come
under that general designation there is
the grande corniche the great road hewn
out of the rugged face of the mountains
as part of the first napoleons ambitious
plan for the conquest of italy there is the
moyenne or middle corniche a newly
constructed road which follows the gen-
eral trend of the former though at a
lower altitude and lastly there is the pe-
tite corniche sometimes called the cor
niche du littoral which as its name im-
plies follows the coastline more or less
the eye of truth



closely and is the nearest route between
monte carlo and nice

  jules having a good car beneath him
and a clear road in front set off at a speed
which would have covered the whole dis-
tance in some twenty minutes or so but
frank soon pulled him up

   i dont mind a bit of fast travelling oc-
casionally he said to vanda by way of
explanation but it seems like sacrilege to
rush through such beautiful scenery with
the speed of an express train just look
at the wonderful shades of blue in that
sea-sapphire turquoise with here and
there a shimmer of that fleeting sheen
that one sees on the breast of a peacock
well has this coast been named the cote
dazur

  vanda turned languidly in her seat and
allowed her eyes to travel over the ex-
panse of sun-kissed waters

  oh yes its very pretty she said
anxious to show her appreciation the
colors are exquisite-that stretch of sea
between that rock and the beach reminds
me of a perfect dream of a dress i bought
as i came through paris-it was exactly
that shade

  doesnt it remind you of anything
else

  struck by his tone she turned and saw
that he was regarding her with a puzzled
frown rousing herself she looked at
the scene before her with a new interest
and her heart gave a quick nervous throb
as she realized how narrowly she had
escaped a bad blunder

  why of course its the place i chose
for the sketch i showed you this morn-
ing she cried really it was stupid of
me not to recognize it before but my
eyes were dazzled by the sun and i have
a splitting headache do please tell jules
to stop at the first place which looks as if
it could provide a decent cup of tea

  a few minutes later they halted in the

villa-lined boulevard of cap-dail before
an establishment which proudly an-
nounced its ability to supply every want of
the english or american visitor and while
vanda was drinking her tea frank strolled
out and gazed over the low stone wall to
where the distant promontory of cap
ferret hung like a faint blue cloud mid-
way between sea and sky

  for several minutes he remained in
silent contemplation of the scene before
him then with something that sounded
like a sigh he turned to make his way
back to the car as he swung round he
noticed for the first time a girl who was
seated before a small sketching-easel on a
stretch of grass overlooking the scene he
had just been admiring

  mary deane had felt a very natural
elation when she had quitted lady vanda
delafer at the hotel de paris that morn-
ing her art meant something more to
her than just a pleasant mode of passing
the time in the open air it was her liveli-
hood and to have sold four pictures in
one morning was an event as rare as it
was welcome she had received no
money it is true but it never occurred to
mary to doubt her somewhat haughty
patron when she had promised to let her
have a check the following morning had
she known the real character of that lady
and the deception in which her own pic-
tures were to play a prominent part
marys steps might have been less buoy-
ant and her mind less at ease than was
actually the case when she had sallied
forth-after an early and somewhat more
sumptuous lunch in honor of the occasion
-to begin another picture it was while
she was engaged in roughing in the out-
line that frank hartley caught sight of
her

  at first his interest was awakened by
the girls occupation rather than by the
girl herself all unconscious of his pres-


weird tales

ence she was seated with her face half
turned away from him her eyes fixed al-
ternately on the canvas before her and the
distant view all he could see was the
outline of her face against the shadowy
green of the foliage behind yet the dimly
seen profile was one which represented in
living flesh and blood his own mental con-
ception of ideal beauty

  but he was conscious of something
more than mere prettiness in her face
character and determination showed in
the line of her dark eyebrows and in her
firm red-lipped mouth and resolute chin
while the steady eyes of blue-gray were
singularly intelligent as well as beautiful
dark though her hair was something told
him that the girl was neither french
nor italian was she english or amer-
ican-

  frank frank where have you dis-
appeared to

  the voice of vanda harsh with impa-
tience broke in upon his thoughts with
one lingering glance at the unknown
girl at the easel frank stepped out into
the road and waved his hand

  oh there you are i was beginning
to think you intended remaining in this
place all day i finished my tea ages ago
and ive been jooking for you every-
where-

  frank looked at vanda curiously as her
voice came to an abrupt stop her eyes
wide open and filled with an expression
which looked more like fear than surprize
were looking past him at the girl seated at
the easel who now had risen to her feet
and was regarding vanda with what
looked like a smile of recognition

  why - do you know her frank
cried in eager surprize

  no--yes-that is slightly vanda
with the merest suspicion of a nod to
mary deane grasped franks arm and

almost dragged him to the car let us
be moving on

  she sprang into the car and held the
door open frank hesitated his foot on
the step

  but who is that girl she seemed to
know you

  lady vandas quick wits had already
concocted an explanation

  oh her she drawled carelessly
shes some poor creature who called at
the hotel the other day hawking some
wretched daubs which she said shed
painted i really couldnt help feeling
sorry for her for she told a pitiful story
of having been lured to monte carlo by
an adventurer who had deceived her by
promising marriage of course one meets
all kinds of such people in a place like
this and i am not narrow-minded thank
heaven i gave the girl a few guineas
out of pure charity and i suppose the poor
creature is grateful please dont humil-
iate her by questioning her further the
best thing we can do is to get along to
nice

  jules let in the clutch and the great car
began to glide smoothly along the road
which stretched like a twisted ribbon of
white between the blue of the sea and the
warm gray of the mountains turning
frank caught a glimpse of the girl still
standing by her easel when a turn of
the road hid her from sight he settled
himself in his seat and lit a cigarette with
a thoughtful and slightly puzzled air

  somehow the girl with the blue-gray
eyes and lady vandas description of her
did not seem to fit

hats all the excitement about
jules

  their car had crossed the pont gari-
baldi at nice and had entered the place
massena when the sight of a large and
the eye of truth



excited crowd gathered before the hotel
de viile brought forth franks inquiry
they are waiting to hear the result of
the public lottery msieu-the same that
i bought a ticket for before we left monte
carlo

  frank smiled slightly as he remembered
how die nimble-witted frenchman had
forestalled him in the purchase of die lot-
tery ticket recommended by count rou-
lette

  well you deserve to be fortunate-
if only for your pluckj he said half jest-
ingly say what would you do if your
ticket carried off the first prize

  i would make good use of the money
msieu the man replied with an earnest-
ness dial was almost pathetic i have
my eye on a httie garage business that is
going cheap-cheap msieu will under-
stand for a man with  francs in
his pocket there i would make much
money and there is a girl  at nar-
bonne  we have waited so long
msieu for we are both poor and when
monsieur ie comte spoke of die winning

ticket i seemed to see a way-

  i understand franks tone was
free from jesting now you run us
round to thenegresco garage the car and
then skim off to see if youve been lucky
and i hope you have-for the sake of die
girl at narbonne

  i thank msieu for his good wishes
the car turned into the promenade des
anglais and a few minutes later came to
a halt opposite the great hotel where
count roulette had promised to meet
them jules immediately disappeared
with the car in the direction of the hotel
garage and frank and lady vanda made
their way through the vestibule and in-
quired for the room which had been
reserved for them

  it was quickly evident that count rou-
lettes was a name to oonjure with in the

hotel negcesco it was the height of die
winter season when the hotel is at its
busiest yet the room which was placed at
their disposal was one of the much-cov-
eted apartments with a southerly aspect
with large windows overlooking the lim-
pid blue waters of the baie des anges
it was with an ever-increasing wonder that
lady vanda saw the deference which the
mere mention of his name inspired

  who is this mysterious count she
asked frank as they sat on the shaded
balcony awaiting his arrival is he a
prophet-a seer or is he merely a liitie
wrong in his head

  frank could only shrug helplessly

  i really know no more about him
than you do vanda

  the girl frowned at what she imagined
was an evasive answer

  is he a madman she demanded
bluntly

  there is method in his madness
then frank laughed and i know id
sooner trust his judgment than that of the
sanest man living he may be a little
strange and eccentric vanda but you can
take my word for it that hes far from
mad

  for a few minutes there was silence
die girl gazing out to sea with eyes that
were half veiled in thought

  have you noticed that queer eyeglass
that he carries on a gold chain she
asked suddenly have you noticed his
trick of looking at people through it al-
most as if he were examining their secret
souls i thought he was short-sighted at
first but i watched him and found that
he could see things near to him and far
off without using it i suppose that is
part of the poor mans eccentricity

  maybe franks tone was curt for
vandas question was but a thinly veiled
sneer perhaps he can see more than we


weird tales

suspect with that antique-looking glass of
his

  lady vanda delafer threw back her
head and gave a peal of mocking laugh-
ter

  perhaps he saw the winning number
of the lottery in which poor jules with a
faith that would be touching if it were not
laughable invested his money this morn-
ing

  he may have seen even that frank
hartley crossed to the bell and a moment
later one of the waiters entered the room
do you know the number of the winning
ticket in the national lottery he asked
the man

  mais out monsieur i myself have
speculated but without success helas
the winning number was lf 

  vanda sat back in her chair with a
gasp

  it is the very number that the count
told you to buy she cried her eyes wide
open with something more than surprize
jules has won a fortune

   well he deserves his luck for he had
more faith in the count than we had
cried frank and i must say im glad
both for his sake and the sake of the girl
at narbonne-

and i monsieur am deeply sorry
xvsaid a voice which caused them both
to look round with a start

  count roulette had entered the room
at the heels of the waiter and was regard-
ing them with an expression of sadness
on his pale handsome face he came
slowly forward dismissed the waiter with
a nod then raised his eyeglass and looked
fixedly at the newly engaged pair

   doubtless it seems strange to you that
i should express sorrow at the news of
your chauffeurs good fortune said the
count but i have a presentiment that
sorrow and tragedy will follow will

you think it presumptuous of me if i beg
of you not to return to monte carlo in
your car

  but-but why not frank stammered
in bewilderment we were looking for-
ward to the run back by moonlight

  the count shrugged

   there is an excellent train service or
my own car is at your disposal but on
no account travel by the one driven by
jules

  at the cool audacity of what she con-
sidered his attempt to dictate to her a
wave of anger came over lady vanda

  you speak in riddles count she
cried you have made one or two pretty
shrewd guesses but that does not give you
the right to rule us like a pair of babies
why shouldnt we go back by my car
jules is a careful driver and i shall feel
quite safe in his charge

   count roulette made a little gesture of
smiling dissent but his voice was grave as
he replied

  tonight mademoiselle he will be
neither steady nor safe he has already
celebrated his good fortune in more than
one cafe and he is a man who carries his
liquor well-up to a certain point but
the corniche is a dangerous road to take
chances on there will be a bad acci-
dent at the sharp bend above cap roux
and the car will swerve over the cliff onto
the rocks below jules will be killed in-
stantly i wish to save you and monsieur
hartley from a similar fate

  for one moment the steady eyes and
slow measured utterance had their effect
then the bantering voice of vanda broke
the tension

  a thousand thanks for your warning
my dear count but i am not nervous
she drawled if you feel jumpy about
a little moonlight spin you are at perfect
liberty to return by rail as for me the
arrangements stand
the eye of truth



  couot roulette turned to frank

  and you he queried

  frank will be guided by me vanda
interposed swiftly please say no more
on the subject the matter is settled

  with a silent shrug count roulette
rang the bell and ordered dinner to be
served he proved to be an excellent
host and during the progress of the meal
did not revert to the topic of the home-
ward journey it was only when he was
bidding the pair good-bye in front of the
hotel that he spoke what was in his mind

  you are determined to disregard my
warning then his voice was almost
wistful as he put the question

  lady vanda laughed openly as she took
her seat in the car

  as you are so solicitous about our
safety my dear count why not come with
us to look after us she scoffed the
car will easily hold another passenger

  count roulette raised his eyeglass and
surveyed the vehicle as though to verify
her words then he came closer and
sank his voice to an impressive whisper
which she alone could hear

  there is another passenger-although
you see him not-a personage whom the
mediaeval artists usually represented rid-
ing on a pale horse with an hour-glass
slung round his bony hips and a whetted
scythe grasped in his skeleton hands
the shadow of death is your fellow-
traveller lady vanda

  wont you introduce him laughed
tlie girl i should imagine that his com-
pany would be a trifle more cheerful than
yours

  she nodded to jules and the car began
to move count roulette raised his hat
with a slow sweeping gesture

  he will need no introduction from me
mademoiselle he said gravely -when
you get to cap rouxl

the big car in which lady vanda and
frank hartley were being driven
back to monte carlo was the last word in
luxury and speed within a few minutes
of leaving the hotel it had purred its
smooth way along the palm-shaded
promenade des anglais skirted the orna-
mental gardens which face the casino
municipal and begun to thread the nar-
rower streets which lead to the eastern
outlet to the town mounting the steadily
rising gradient to the corniche road
with the effortless ease of a swallow on
the wing

  mindful of the counts grim predic-
tion frank watched the chauffeurs man-
ner of taking the corners and avoiding the
oncoming traffic but jules seemed if any-
thing more careful than usual it was not
until they were abreast of the tree-
crowned hill of montboron that he leant
back in his seat convinced that the wine
which jules had taken to celebrate his
accession to wealth had not affected his
eyesight or his judgment it was true that
count roulette had made some lucky
guesses in the past but he had evidently
made a big blunder in stating that there
would be a crash that night it was curi-
ous though how he had contrived to
foretell the number of the winning lot-
tery ticket could it be by some manner
of thought-reading that he made such
confident statements or was it mere
chance that he had happened to be right
but tonight he had made his first mistake
there would be no fatal accident he
would reach monte carlo safely and in the
morning would call on the count and
chaff him unmercifully on the danger of
being too explicit in his predictions

   with a smile at his foolishness in tak-
ing the mans pretensions so seriously
frank dismissed the subject from his
mind and gave himself up to enjoying the
beauty of the night


weird tales

  the three corniche roads which lead
eastward from nice have been well
named each is actually a mere corniche
or ledge hewn for the greater part of its
length from the sheer face of the cliff a
ribbon coiled and draped between the
mighty ramparts of the mountain hinter-
land and the tideless sea the road they
were now traversing had appeared beau-
tiful enough when seen basking in the
dazzling sunshine with sky sea and the
flower-decked gardens combining in a
riot of color now as frank lay back in
his cushioned seat watching the proces-
sion of dark pines and palms silhouetted
against the starry sky breathing the warm
air scented with wisteria and golden mi-
mosa he felt as though he were being
borne by some fabled genii through an
enchanted land every unexpected twist
of the mazy track brought its fresh angle
of vision at one moment the bonnet of
the car would be pointing straight inland
to where the purple-blue heights rose
star-crowned and mysterious a sudden
bend and they would be looking over the
smooth moonlit waters with nothing but a
light railing or a crumbling moss-grown
wall between them and the sheer verge of
the cliffs

  you seem vgry silent tonight frank
has our cheerful friend the count
rubbed the fear of death into you with his
crazy prophecies

  there was a note of sarcasm in the
slowly drawled query that brought him to
earth with a sudden jar

  my thoughts were far away from
count roulette and his prophecies he
answered

  then what were you thinking of
come dear she moved closer to him and
slipped her arm coaxingly through his
there should be no secrets between en-
gaged couples you know will a penny

buy your thoughts or shall i have to bid

higher

  her smiling lips were temptingly close
to his as she leaned forward but he was
almost unconscious of them as he turned
his head and again looked out into the
night

  just at that moment i fear my thoughts
were not worth even a penny he an-
swered carelessly i was merely admir-
ing the scenery and thinking what won-
derful pictures might be painted of some
of the spots we have passed im rather
surprized that the same thought did not
occur to you vanda-with such scenes to
inspire you you might even excel that
wonderful sketch you showed me this
morning

  yes yes-of course she hastened to
say turning her head aside to hide the
frown that had gathered on her forehead
his words had recalled the memory of
her debt to the pretty young artist and
her own non-existent bank balance how
she wished that she had taken the advice
of the eccentric count roulette and
risked a few francs on the lottery ticket
he had so confidently asserted would win
the prize mad or sane his luck was
amazing his guesses of the trend of fu-
ture events had been verified in a manner
that was almost uncanny but no man
could always be right and it seemed self-
evident that he had overreached himself
when he had predicted disaster that night

  what place is that she asked as they
came through a cluster of white villas on
a bold promontory overlooking the sea

  beaulieu he glanced at her with a
slight smile as he added the point you
can see about a mile farther on is cap
roux unless count roulette is a lying
prophet it is there we shall meet our fate
so if you wish to circumvent che decrees
of destiny you had better get out and
walk
the eye of truth



  how absurd her laugh rang out in
amused contempt i wonder that you
have the patience to listen to such non-
sense nobody but a madman would
claim to see the future as he does

  quite so my dear but all the

same- he reached up and took the

speaking-tube from its clip jules he
called through to the chauffeur please
be careful as you take that sharp turn
above cap roux-just before you come to
die railway bridge you know

  trust me for that msieu came back
the confident reply one does not want
to break ones neck just after having won
a fortune

  the car was now skirting the wide
sweep of the bay of beaulieu past the
fantastic masses of tumbled rocks and
jagged cliffs which have received the fan-
ciful name of petite-afrique here the
broken nature of the ground has com-
pelled the road to run through a series of
short tunnels beneath the towering bluffs
which intersect its path jules slowed
down to a mere crawl as they entered the
last tunnel which pierces the cap itself
and it was only when they emerged into
the moonlight on the farther side that
he stepped on the accelerator and the car
leapt forward like a hound unleashed

  a derisive laugh came from lady
vandas lips

  were through without mishap she
cried your wonderful prophet is a
charlatan-a trickster-a cheap liar   
ah god help us  

  her mocking voice ended in a scream
of mortal terror as a pair of glaring head-
lights sprang into view round the bend a
few yards ahead it was a high-powered
english car traveling at speed on the
left-the wrong according to continental
usage-side of the road

  jules had a bare two seconds in which
jto act yet he might have avoided a col-

lision had his brain been unclouded by
the fumes of wine a slight turn of the
steering-wheel and he could have passed
on the other side with twice the width of
the car to spare as it was he jammed on
the brakes and the car skidded to the
right crashed its way through the light
iron railing and remained poised precari-
ously on the very verge of the abyss below

  but only for an instant there was a
rending crash as the oncoming car struck
the rear of the chassis sending it nearer
the edge frank felt the floor beneath
his feet take a steeper angle as the bonnet
began to dip streams of loosened clods
and fragments of stone began to clatter
down the cliff

  jump he shouted to vanda jump
for your life

  but the girl was crouching back in her
seat her hands pressed over her eyes too
terrified to move quick as thought
frank stepped to her side his jeft arm
seemed strangely limp and useless but
with his right he strove to lift her from
the seat with the unreasoning panic of
semi-consciousness she clung to the side
of the car resisting his efforts to save her

  let go he cried striving to break
her hold with his one serviceable hand
its death to stop here

  even as he spoke the car gave another
lurch forward there came a sound of
tearing and rending of metal as the last
remnant of the shattered railings gave way
beneath the weight thrown upon them
just in time frank leapt upward his right
hand stretched to grasp the branch of a
tree which showed black against the sky
a few feet above his head and as he
sprang the doomed car slid from beneath
him plunging accompanied by an ava-
lanche of stones over the edge and falling
with a dull splash into the sea far below

  it seemed ages that he hung there be-
fore willing arms grasped him by the legs


weird tales

and lowered him to the ground faint
and reeling sick with horror and the pain
of an arm which he now realized was
broken he staggered to the road as a
large covered car appeared from the direc-
tion of nice and came to a standstill a
moment later he was looking into the face
of count roulette

  so the accident has happened the
voice of the mysterious greek was as un-
concerned as if he were making a remark
on the weather it seems as if my wild
prophecy was not very wide of the truth

  frank hartley took an unsteady pace
forward and looked the old man full in
the eyes

  who are you he demanded hoarse-
ly are you angel of light or fiend from
hell that you are able to see the fates of
men and read their hearts like the pages
of a book seer-magician-angel-
devil which are you speak

  a faint smile broke the sphinx-like im-
mobility of count roulettes features as
he shrugged slightly

  none of these things am i my young
friend he said his somber eyes fixed on
the others face i am merely a man like
yourself-but i am a man who sees the
truth

  for an instant frank stared stupidly
trying to grasp his meaning then came
the inevitable reaction of the shock and
numbing pain he opened his lips to
speak but before the words came he
swayed unsteadily and fell in a dead faint
at the feet of the man with the strange-
looking eyeglass

dreams vivid and swift-moving yet
vague and confused as a fogged
cinema film preceded frank hartleys
return to consciousness once more he
fought the two apaches in the gardens of
the casino once more he saw the graceful
figure of the unknown gill seated at her

easel against a background of sea and sky
then came the repetition of the counts
solemn warning the night ride through
the scented air the impact of the collid-
ing cars and the vision of lady vandas
terror-frozen features as she fell when
at length his delirium passed and he
looked sanely on his surroundings it was
only with difficulty that he persuaded him-
self that what he saw was not another
phase of his visions

  he was lying in bed in a prettily dec-
orated room overlooking the sea the
furniture and decorations though plain
and inexpensive evidenced a perfection of
taste with which he could find no fault
the tempered sunshine entering through
drawn window curtains of gay-colored
chintz showed trifles and knickknacks
subtly indicative of a womans presence
an easel beating an unfinished sketch in
oils hinted that the owner of this haven
of harmony and repose possessed at least
one taste in common with him

  turning his eyes again toward the win-
dow he noticed that a girl was bending
over a small table set there arranging
some flowers in a china bowl something
familiar about that slender shadowy out-
line caused him to catch his breath in a
low gasp of surprize he blinked his
eyes and looked again dreading that she
would fade away like the other phantoms
of his dreams but she was still there-
and she was in very truth the girl whom
he had seen painting on the cliffs on that
afternoon that now seemed so long past

  ah you are evidently beginning to
take an interest in your surroundings
said a cheery well-remembered voice from
the other side of the bed

  frank essayed to turn and for the first
time discovered that his left arm was en-
cased in splints and surgical bandages
and strapped immovably across his chest

  no no dont move count roulette
the eye of truth



went on hastily moving round the bed so
that he came within franks range of
vision you have been through a bad
time what with the shock and the frac-
ture but you are on the mend now and
in a few days you may be about again
but the others - jules and lady
vanda were they killed

  there was a grave expression on the old
mans face as he inclined his head in as-
sent

  no human efforts could have saved
them it is a sheer drop of eighty feet
into deep water    the bodies were not
recovered until two days later

  two days frank gasped then
how long have i been lying here

  a week came the answer and as he
spoke the count beckoned to the girl at
the window and you have to thank
this young lady for her clever nursing
during your crisis allow me to intro-
duce you to miss mary deane

  frank felt a strange thrill as her cool
hand touched his own for an instant

  how can i thank you for your kind-
ness he said in a voice full of genuine
emotion i was a stranger to you yet

you gave me shelter-nursed me-

  she held her hand up in protest

  what else could i have done she
said my bungalow was the nearest to
the scene of the accident-or almost the
nearest-and you were much too ill to be
carried farther how could i turn you
from my door when count roulette sol-
emnly declared that the delay in getting you
to the hospital would mean the difference
between life and death besides you
were not quite a stranger since the count
vouched for you-and he seems to be an
excellent judge of character

  a smile spread over franks pale face
he does indeed he agreed heartily
seeing that he has chosen you for my
guardian angel

  the whole-hearted fervor with which
the words were spoken caused a deeper
tint to creep into the girls cheeks

  i can see that you are getting light-
headed mr hartley she said in a tone
of severe reproof as she poured out a
dose of medicine and held it to his lips
come drink this then go to sleep
until you can talk rationally

  there was a gleam of amusement in
count roulettes eyes as he raised his eye-
glass and looked at each in turn

  i venture to predict a speedy recovery
for our patient he said with a smile as
he quitted the room mr frank hart-
ley may consider himself very fortunate
to be here-in more ways than one he
added under his breath as the door closed
behind him

vou are a strange man count and

  x you possess a positively uncanny
power of guessing the trend of future
events it was three days later when
frank and count roulette were seated on
the balcony of the bungalow that the
younger man made the remark and i
must confess that i envy you your strange
gift

  are you sure you mean that the
old mans eyes were fixed on frank with
a keen penetrating gaze as he asked the
question is it enviable think you ts
walk the crowded streets of a great city
conscious of the greed hatred jealousy
and dishonesty which eat like loathsome
cankers in the hearts of those around me
to see beneath the smug respectable
faces of the business men or the beauti-
ful faces of the women hidden thoughts
which make one turn to the dumb animals
for relief to have every ideal-every
pleasing illusion shattered for ever no
no envy me not my strange power but
rather go down on your knees in thank-
fulness that you have been spared the pos


weird tales

session of such a dangerous saddening
gift

  frank hartley was bewildered at the
intense emotion which vibrated in the old
mans voice

  you almost speak as if this power had
been forced on you against your will he
observed with a slight smile

   in one sense it has been forced on me
nothing was farther from my thoughts
when i discovered the eye of veritas
veritas frank repeated the word
slowly a puzzled frown creasing his fore-
head that has something to do with
truth has it not

   count roulette gave an affirmative nod
it is the name of one of the deities of
ancient greece-the goddess of truth
she was not very famous or well known
i must admit and you will find but few
references to her in the classical writers
for the greeks of old apparently had as
slight a veneration for the virtue she sym-
bolized as have the people of the present
day but she had her temples and her
mysteries and one lonely mountain shrine
in bceotia was considered especially sacred
and thither flocked crowds of pilgrims
all eager to know the truth and-for the
time being-to revere so rare a virtue it
was in the ruins of that temple of ver-
itas that i became the most favored the
most cursed the most disillusioned of
mortals-a man who saw the truth

  a low long-drawn sigh escaped the
lips of count roulette and for a while he
sat silent his dark eyes fixed on the dis-
tant horizon with an expression of wistful
yearning as though he were regretting
something lost to him for ever present-
ly he roused himself and continued

  at the time it happened some forty
years ago i was a young man fresh from
college but young as i was i had made a
special study of the classical lore of my
country which resulted in my obtaining

a permanent post in the excavations de-
partment of the hellenic archeological
society for some time our headquarters
at athens had been receiving vague ru-
mors of hoards of statues coins and
relics being unearthed by the peasants on
the site of the ancient city of tanagra
which is quite close to the modern village
of skimatari i was deputed to go to the
district to see if i could find out if there
was any truth in the rumors in order to
allay suspicion i went alone in the char-
acter of a man who travels for pleasure

  i soon found that my task was not
likely to be either easy or pleasant in
ancient times bceotia had a most unenvi-
able reputation and the cultured athen-
ians were never tired of contemptuously
referring to the inhabitants as stupid
awkward uncivilized and ignorant they
pointed out with truth that the country
had contributed nothing to greek litera-
ture nor had it produced a great sculptor
or painter of note-indeed the veryword
bceotian was at that period almost synon-
ymous with imbecility and i can affirm
from personal experience that their pres-
ent-day descendants have many of the
trails of their departed ancestors i have
traveled much since that time but never
have i encountered a more degraded dis-
honest brutal and treacherous horde of
scoundrels than the inhabitants of that
wretched village near the site of the an-
cient temple of truth

  there were only two men in skimatari
whom i felt i could trust one was the
village priest a venerable old man with
flowing silvery hair and a patriarchal
beard and the other was the landlord of
the inn where i put up this latter was
the very personification of the traditional
innkeeper of stage and story fat red-
cheeked with merry twinkling eyes and
a bluff hearty manner that made me take
to him at first sight his name was gior-

                    w t-
the eye of truth



gios dimitri but he was usually railed by
his nickname of barba-jorghi which
means old george as for the rest of
the villagers they seemed to suspect the
reason of my presence and remained sul-
lenly aloof needless to say the moment
i arrived the secret excavations that they
had been making were filled in and i
could discover nothing

   well i had hung about the village to
no good results for a week or more and
i was seriously thinking of giving up my
quest as a bad job and making my way
back to athens when late one night
after the last toper had staggered out of
the inn barba-jorghi sidled up to me
with a proposition that sent my hopes
soaring to the skies

  of course he did not come to the
point directly he began a long rambling
diatribe about the scarcity of travelers the
poverty of his village customers the high
price of wine and the smallness of his
-profits from that he went on to draw
comparisons between thetpresent wretch-
edness of the district and its former
wealth pointing his words to my great
amazement by producing a well-thumbed
copy of mullers translation of dicaerchus
a classical author who wrote in the second
century b c thinking to draw him out
by a little flattery i complimented him on
his archeological knowledge and he
snapped at the bait like a famished pike

    you are right he cried although
you see me here the keeper of a poor inn
struggling to make a paltry drachma or
two i am not like the ignorant swine
around me no no-old jorghi can
read he can study he can think he can
look up and see far afield while the other
fools toil with their faces to the ground
old jorghi s wise even as you are my
young friend we are two wise men in
a community of fools and like wise men
we should turn our wisdom to account
w t-

  naturally i asked him how and he
went on

   this writer speaks of a famous or-
acle situated near here which people
came from all parts to consult he says
that this oracle which was kept in a small
temple in the mountains predicted future
events laid bare the secret thoughts illu-
minating the hidden souls of men like the
noonday sun shining through a crystal
goblet of wine not that you or i believe
such fairy-tales he added with a knowing
wink but the all-important thing which
concerns us is that the indent pilgrims
believed them and showered their offer-
ing of gold silver and predous stones into
the coffers of the wily priests there must
be wealth untold lying in the ruins of that
temple of veritas-enough to make us
both millionaires

  his words and manner set my pulses
racing with excitement for it was clear
that he was about to broach the very mat-
ter which had brought me from athens
i managed to infuse a note of amused in-
credulity into my voice as i replied but
theres small chance of us ever finding it
worse luck

  the innkeeper leaned nearer to me
across the table his eyes glittering in the
dim lamplight

   i have already found it-i barba-
jorghi the keeper of a village inn- have
found the site of the ancient oracle of
truth

  for the first time a vague suspicion en-
tered my mind

   then why do you confide in me i
asked why dont you take the treasure
and be rich

 i would if i could he answered with
engaging frankness but it will need the
strength of two men to move the blocks
of stone which seal the door of the treas-
ure chamber i dare not ask the aid of
my ndghbors-they would murder me

the magnificence of the offer itself almost
took my breath away

   but i am an utter stranger to
you- i began to protest

   all the better he interrupted quick-
ly with a smile which rather puzzled me
at the time being a stranger you can
leave the district without raising com-
ment tomorrow you must let it be
known that you are tired of the place and
intend returning to athens you will set
off on horseback in full view of the vil-
lagers and take the highroad which fol-
lows the coast setting your pace so that
you arrive at oropus a little after dusk has
fallen a little beyond the town is a
bridle path leading back across the moun-
tains follow this and you will come to
a deserted post-house at the crossroads i
will be awaiting you there with the neces-
sary tools and a spare mule to carry the
treasure which you will bear to some ob-
scure retreat until i can settle up my affairs
here sell the inn for what it will fetch
and afterward join you do you think my
plan is good

  i nodded silently well pleased that he
had played so blindly into my hands and
after we had gone over the details once
more we parted and retired for the night

ts verything went off without a hitch

      i	reached the deserted post-house
shortly after ten oclock tethered my
horse in one of the roofless stables and
followed barba-jorghi along a narrow
boulder-strewn track which led at a steep
angle up the mountain it was ticklish
work in the darkness for at places the
path overhung the gorge below and a
single false step would have meant death

 but jorghi had made himself well
 acquainted with the track and after about
 an hour of stiff climbing we emerged
 safely on to a little wooded plateau which
 jutted out like a broad spur from the mass
 of the mountain proper without hesita-
 tion he plunged into the dense under-
 growth forcing his way through until he
 came to a halt facing what seemed to be a
 huge mound overgrown with tangled
 bushes here he lit the lantern he car-
 ried and by its light he searched for a
 time along the edge of the mound pres-
 ently he set the lantern down and pulled
 aside a heap of dead leaves and branches

     look he said pointing downward

    my heart leapt when i saw a portion
 of a wall of squared masonry with the
 sculptured lintel of a door just showing
 above the surface of the ground it did
 not need a second glance at the angular
 greek characters engraved on the weather-
 worn stone to tell me that i stood on the
 threshold ofjhe-fafelsdtempteottruth

    in silence we set to work to dig down
 -- far enough to effect an entrance but the
 door proved to be blocked by a wall of
 rough blocks of stone which seemed to
 have been built in haste as soon as we
 had cleared sufficient space in which to
 manipulate a pick and crowbar we at-
 tacked this with a will it was heavy
 work but hope spurred us on and at last
 panting and streaming with perspiration
 we squeezed our bodies through and stood
 within

    the light of the lantern was dim and
 it was only by slow degrees that we were
 able to examine our surroundings as i
 made a slow circuit of the place i caught
 glimpses of sculptured friezes fluted col-
 umns doric capitals matchless statues still
 upright on their pedestals treasure or
 no treasure i knew that we had made the
 discovery of a lifetime-an ancient greek
the eye of truth



temple as it was in the heyday i its
splendor

   we waste time cried jorghi impa-
tiently snatching the lantern from me
the treasure man the treasure

  beyond the small ring of lantemlight
the darkness seemed to hem us in like
a solid wall the air was pervaded with a
deathlike chill the silence so intense that
our restrained breathing sent vague echoes
gliding before us like sighing ghosts as we
made our way into the innermost sanctu-
ary where a huge statue of truth naked
yet chaste towered dimly above us with
a shout of joy barba-jorghi darted for-
ward and flung himself on a massive cof-
fer of greenish bronze which stood in a
recess behind the statue

   it is here-the treasure he shouted
the treasure at last

  seizing the crowbar he thrust the
point under the hasp which secured the
kd wrenching the corroded metal apart
with a creaking of disused hinges the
lid swung up revealing a heap of yellow-
ish-gray material a cry of disappoint-
ment burst from my companion

   rags-nothing but id rags he
groaned

   be silent i whispered fiercely for
my awn nerves were on edge who
knows what is underneath

  i thrust him aside and knelt before the
chest lifting out the garments one by one
and laying them on the floor they had
the appearance of ceremonial robes worn
by the priests but they were so tender
with age that the material came into shreds
even as i lifted them right at the bot-
tom of the coffer i came upon this-

  count roulette paused in his narrative
and held up the eyeglass that was suspend-
ed from his neck frank hartley looked
surprized

  but i thought the science of optics

was quite unknown in those ancient days

he said

  the count nodded in agrement

quite so but they were acquainted
with something even more wonderful

  struck by his peculiar tone frank bent
forward and examined the object with
closer interest apparently it had ao
magnifying power for the surfaces were
quite flat it seemed to be nothing more
than a thin segment of natural colorless
crystal slightly oval in shape and set in a
narrow band of gold the handle being
formed of the slender figure of a woman
probably intended to represent veritas
herself

  there does not appear to be anything
very wonderful about that glass frank
declared at length

  so i thought myself when i first dis-
covered it the old man continued nat-
urally my first act was to take it up and
hold it to my eye to ascertain if it pos-
sessed any optical properties and the most
convenient object on which to focus it was
the face of barba-jorghi as he stood
watching me keenly to my eye how-
ever the crystal seemed to have no more
effect than a piece of common glass but
its effect on my brain my understanding
was astounding as though illuminated
by a ray of sunlight entering a pitch-dark
room i saw the man as he really was-
his hidden thoughts-his schemes-his
villainy-lay bare before me beneath
his bluff hearty mask was a soul filled
with avarice cunning and treachery
having paved the way by inducing me to
announce my departure openly thus mak-
ing sure that no awkward questions would
follow my disappearance he intended to
murder me the moment the treasure was
unearthed and with one swift well-aimed
shot rid himself of an inconvenient wit-
ness and a sharer in the spoil the rev-


weird tales

elation was so sudden and unexpected
that for a moment i was stunned

   what have you found my friend
the smooth oily voice roused me is it
gold-a jewel

   something more precious than either
i answered swiftly why are you aim-
ing a loaded revolver at me from beneath
your cloak

  the unctuous smirk vanished from his
face as his jaw sagged open i saw a
quick movement of his hand beneath his
cloak and had barely time to duck before
a shot rang out and a bullet smacked
against the wall behind me before the
echoes of the explosion had died away i
had drawn my own weapon and shot him
dead

teavinghis bod lying before the altar
jl i slipped the glass of truth into
my pocket and quitted the sanctuary has-
tily filling in the pit we had dug in order
to enter that night i rode fast and far
and by daylight i found myself in a little
seaport on the gulf of petali there i
sold my horse and with the proceeds paid
my passage to messina by a small tramp
steamer that was on the point of sailing
in sicily it did not take me long to find
a gambling-hell where thanks to my mag-
ic glass i won in an hour enough to carry
me to the more palatial casinos of the
riviera i could easily have broken the
bank at each but i dreaded attracting at-
tention so contented myself with modest
stakes reserving the bulk of my winnings
for big deals on the stock markets of dif-
ferent european capitals in less than a
year i was a wealthy man

  but the mere accumulation of money
gave me little satisfaction i wanted to
turn my marvelous gift to some purpose
that would bring lasting benefit to hu-
manity then came the great disillusion-
ment travel where i would search as

i might everywhere i saw the same de-
ceit guile and greed in the hearts of those
with whom i came into contact few in-
deed were there from whom i did not
shrink with disgust when i examined
them through my magic glass i almost
despaired of humanity until i chanced
upon a young artist who had given up his
hopes of inheriting his fathers millions
that he might earn his livelihood by his
own talents but he was on the point of
ruining his happiness by marrying a
worthless woman whose only aim was a
life of wealth and luxury this unscru-
pulous harpy in order to effect her pur-
pose had acquired the pictures of a strug-
gling artist and passed them off as her
own work the masterpieces you so ad-
mired as the work of lady vanda were in
reality painted by mary deane the girl to
whose devoted nursing you owe your life

the effect of the counts words was
galvanic during the unfolding of
the story amazement incredulity and
doubt had in turn shown on the young
mans mobile features but as he now
struggled to his feet his shining eyes and
flushed face told that belief had prevailed
over the sober dictates of common sense

  what would i not give to possess the
eye of truth he cried by its aid i
could solve the deepest mysteries-read
the hearts of all men-control the stock
markets of the world-back the winning
horse in every race i could discover the
hidden virtues and beauties of the
world--

   and likewise its hatreds its sins its
miseries count roulette shook his head
as he laid his hand kindly on franks
shoulder seek not too deep a knowl-
edge my young friend if the eye of
truth can show you the pathto happiness
believe me it can do no more

  no more the other gasped his face
the eye of truth



blank with surprize could i not dis-
cover every gold mine in the world-un-
earth secret treasures-

  one treasure-one inestimable treas-
ure-may yet be yours

  the old man raised his voice as he
called the name of mary deane and as
the girl approached looking curiously
from one to the other he held the eye of
truth between her and frank so that each
looked at the other through its crystal
disk

   for a full minute they stood there gaz-
ing into each others eyes and reading
there the secret that their lips had never
uttered then without speaking frank
leant forward and caught her slender
body in his arms bending his head until
her trembling lips fluttered up to his

  and now said count roulette soft-
ly it is time for us to part

  frank turned quickly at the sound of
the word

  part surely not so soon therewas
genuine regret in his voice you have
brought such happiness into my life that
i am loth to say good-bye besides i
should like to have a few more peeps
through that wonderful glass of yours
there was a whimsical expression on
the counts face as he shook his head
no no my young friend you had

better rest content with what you have al-
ready seen the eye of truth has shown
you how to be happy-it can do no more
remember it is a wise lover-and a still
wiser husband-that does not see too
much he held out both hands to them
as he went on my mission here is end-
ed at sundown my yacht sails from
monte carlo and it is unlikely that our
paths in life will cross again so fare-
well to you both my children   
farewell

some three hours later as the dying sun
was drooping towafd the horizon a
white-painted yacht crept into sight round
the distant rocky headland of monaco and
steamed westward along the coast it was
count roulette leaving for his unknown
destination

   standing hand in hand on the balcony
of the bungalow mary deane and frank
watched it draw abreast of them and saw
the tiny flag at the masthead dip thrice in
silent salute then the bows of the ver-
itas swung seaward and the dainty craft
grew gradually smaller and dimmer until
its trailing plume of smoke merged into
the shadows of the coming night

  the eye of truth had passed but it
had left behind a legacy of love and hap-
piness that would only pass with life itself

ds hantom hand

by victor rousseau

an astounding novel of black magic eery murders and
weird occult happenings

the story thus far

hurrying home from china to
loma west to whom he is en-
gaged don wentworth is ap-
palled to learn that her father senator
lemuel west has paid the supreme pen-
alty of the law for the murder of police
captain morse who was investigating his
political activities

  at cannonville wests home he meets
one sudh hafiz a persian in charge of a
babist temple who informs him of a
gang of conspirators who railroaded west
to his doom these consist of moroni
the bootlegger walstein the political
boss abner wells and their leader god-
frey moore the millionaire a master of
black magic

  hafiz takes don out to moores house
where he finds loma living mentally de-
ranged she hardly knows him that
night while moroni is a guest at a tel-
evision demonstration on moores radio
the phantom of west appears in place of
the grand opera stage and moroni drops
dead

  next day returning to moores house
don and hafiz find moore tied up he
says walstein has kidnapped lorna and
taken her to moronis headquarters where
he has gone to search for moronis secret
papers the two follow to the lonely cab-
in on the shore and are surprized and
bound lorna becomes entranced and
wests phantom appears while the search
is proceeding and attacks walstein who
thinking moronis men have assaulted
him engages in a duel with them ending


in his death and that of the three others
don rescues lorna

  the story continues

it was on the evening of the day of
walsteins death don had brought
lorna back to sudh hafizs house and
kid her on the lounge in the living-room
the girl had been in the same automaton-
like condition as when he had seen her in
the vault of moronis hangout she had
obeyed all dons requests but she had
seemed to have become a mere machine

  she had stepped quietly out of the car
and gone into the house and don had
laid her down sudh hafiz had mixed her
a sherbet and she had drunk it at dons
instructions after which she had seemed
to fall asleep

  it is a powerful oriental drug sudh
hafiz explained it has the exactly op-
posite effect of hashish and opium-that
is to say it binds the soul more tightly
to the body instead of loosing it it may
be that she will awaken well again

  in which case i shall ask her to marry
me immediately said don

  while loma slept the two men had
discussed the situation it was not likely
that the bodies of walstein and the three
other dead men would be discovered for
a considerable time since there was no
reason to suppose that walstein had gone
to moronis hangout already moore had
succeeded in doing away with two of his
confederates in crime and there remained
only abner wells the ex-candidate for
mayor on the silk-stocking ticket if
don was to clear senator wests name

 this story began in weird tiles for july
the phantom hand



he flicked bis fingers and a tongue of white flame
leaped from the disk stinging don like a whip

xvav

it was essential that abner wells should
live

  a hasty glance at the papers taken
from the cellar showed that wells was
implicated in various shady transactions
but there was no proof that he had plotted
the death of captain morse

  it is essential said sudh hafiz that
miss west shall not fall into moores
hands again it is only through her that
her fathers phantom can be materialized
you must marry her and take her away
wentworth and forego all thoughts of

vengeance upon moore for the present

  that is my intention answered don

  our great need is to manage to get in
touch with west if we could talk to him
and convince him that his blind murder-
ous attacks upon his persecutors are de-
feating their own ends that only by let-
ting abner wells live can we hope to ob-
tain the evidence that will clear him   
but unfortunately it is only through his
daughter that he can be reached and
that means throwing her into her state of
catalepsy


weird tales

    no more of that said don

    then-we can do nothing

    how about frightening wells by tell-
  ing him we know all about his involve-
  ment in the cannonville traction deal
  letting him think we know more than we
  do asked don if we could get him
  as an ally on our side with the promise
  of immunity-

    suppose you take miss west away
  first answered the persian marry her
  restore her to health give her a chance to
  forget then well see what can be done
  remember godfrey moore knows you are
  his most bitter enemy he has struck
  twice and successfully as soon as he
   has disposed of abner wells he will try
  to put you out of the way let us see
  what is the effect of the drug i have
  given her

    tvon youve come back ive wanted
         you sor

    don overjoyed to find loma in her
  right mind at last kneeled down beside
  her and put his arms about her

    where are we don how long have
  you been back in america i-ive been
  ill i think

    youve been ill dear i only re-
  turned yesterday i hurried back as soon
  as i was set free by the brigands who cap-
  tured me in china you knew about
  that

    oh yes don and i was so anxious
  about you i-i dont seem to remember
  much after-what happened the shock
  of it must have unhinged me i think i
  remember mr moore was kind enough to
  offer me a home but-this isnt his home
  is it

    no this is the house of sudh
  hafiz-

    the persian of course i know him
  he was very kind to poor father when
  he-oh i cant bear to think about that

if only youd been able to come in time
but how did i get here

  i took you away from mr moores
house this morning lorna i told him
that i felt i had a better right than any-
body else to care for you i want you to
marry me dear right away dont you
remember we agreed to be married as soon
as i returned

  don i can never marry you now
not until poor fathers name has been
cleared and that may never be

   loma your father was innocent you
and i know it what do we care what
others believe i am going to make it
my life task to clear him but i want you
as my wife loma

  don it wouldnt be right it would
be a millstone about your neck

   i like that sort of millstone dear
say yes 

  but not-not today don let us wait
till i am stronger i feel so weak id
just be a burden

  lorna dear if you dont marry me
ill never be able to begin my work on be-
half of your father he turned as sudh
hafiz who had left the room appeared
in the doorway i think im going to
persuade miss west to marry me to-
night he said its still possible to
marry in this state without a preliminary
waiting isnt it it was when i went
away wed planned to be married the
day that i came back

   its still possible smiled sudh hafiz
well miss west im glad to see you
looking so much better

   i shall never cease to be grateful to
you for your kindness to poor father
said the girl id do anything to show
my gratitude

  then marry don wentworth and
youll never regret it replied the persian
promptly i can get the reverend mr
suydam here in ten minutes have you
the phantom hand



married in twenty the wedding supper in
an hour and see you off on your honey-
moon in my car inside of an hour and a
half

  but my clothes-unless theyre here
i dont know-

  i guess theyre at godfrey moores
said don but you dont need to worry
about them darling if you can last till
tomorrow well stop at some large town
and ill buy you a complete trousseau

  but i havent even a toothbrush said
lorna

  if youll only marry me first i prom-
ise you a dozen toothbrushes darling be-
fore midnight come say that little
word

  yes said lorna

  youd better lie down and rest till
mr suydam gets here suggested sudh
hafiz ill phone him at once he
drew don into the next room i dont
altogether like this he said in a low
voice

  my getting married

  no this sudden improvement its
too good there should normally be a
slight confusion of mind it looks to
me- he hesitated

  go on said don

  -as if a certain entity was in

charge and letting her come through in
order to conceal the fact of his presence

  you mean lemuel west asked don
aghast

  no i dont thats the worst of it
lemuel west would never harm her
though he makes use of her no i mean
an entity sent by moore

  ill take care of that entity answered
don smiling again he was beginning
to discount the persians suggestions for
lornas recovery had made the past once
more begin to seem incredible sudh
hafiz without answering went to the tel-
ephone

  mr suydam will be here in half an
hour he said to don who had stolen
back to see lorna again

  shes fallen asleep said don its
just as well there will be a little delay

  shell need a lot of taking care of
answered hafiz above all you must
do your best to discourage her father from
manifesting

  he crossed to a cabinet in the room and
took from it a bottle containing some tiny
pellets i fixed these up for you just
now he said give her two morning
and evening it is the same drug i gave
her this afternoon hello he added as
the door-bell rang that cant be mr
suydam

  he went to open it admitting an elder-
ly man with a fine sensitive face a small
drooping mustache blue eyes and thin-
ning silvery-gray hair the newcomer
looked from the one man to the other

  i take it you are mr hafiz and you
are mr wentworth he said in bitter
tones my name is abner wells no
need to ask if you have heard of me

  i certainly have said don

  wont you come in and sit down in-
quired sudh hafiz

  ill come in but i wont sit down
abner wells entered the room turned
and faced don i understand that you
have been circulating libelous statements
about me mr wentworth he cried

  that is absolutely false said don
i only got back from china yesterday
and at the time i hadnt heard your name
may i ask who your informant is

  that makes no difference i believe
the statement to be true abner wellss
face grew white he raised his fist
let me warn you young man you and
that walstein fellow had better draw in
your horns he shouted ive got in-
fluence enough in this city to break wal-
stein and his gang


weird tales

sudh hafiz stepped to the door and
closed it he came back wal-
steins dead he said

  abner wellss face grew whiter he
staggered back as if he had received a
mortal blow

  wh-when did it happen he asked
in a shocked whisper

  he went to moronis hangout after
his death to look through his papers
answered sudh hafiz he wanted to
get hold of all papers that might incrim-
inate him among others that one that
you were so incautious as to sign relative
to the cannonville traction deal now in
our possession but he was chiefly afraid
that moroni might have been in posses-
sion of evidence that would link him up
with the murder of captain morse
abner wells uttered a strangled cry
his face looked ghastly

  a quarrel arose between walstein
and his man benny and two of moronis
men they shot and stabbed it out in the
cellar and killed one another but let
me speak more plainly mr wells con-
tinued the persian you are a very dif-
ferent type of man from walstein and
moroni you know that godfrey
moores researches in the black art are
not mere dabbling in superstition but hid-
eously real you have the faculty of put-
ting two and tyo together next to
moore you are the most intelligent of all
those implicated in railroading poor west

to the gallows-

  its a damned lie gurgled wells
its true said sudh hafiz suavely
and you are able to see that the death of
moroni and walstein leaves moore at the
mercy of only one man yourself and
that your own chances of prolonged life
are what we may call slender

  now abner wells was silent his
lean face was working his sensitive eyes
alight with intelligence it was plain that
he was doing some rapid thinking

  i think it may be to your advantage
to come to terms with us mr wells said
hafiz

  abner wells looked at him searching-
ly but at that moment the bell rang
again and the persian admitted the rev-
erend mr suydam a jovial elderly cler-
gyman in clerical attire he shook hands
with abner wells whom of course he
knew and much more cordially with
don

  i have heard about you mr went-
worth he said your kidnapping by
those chinese brigands caused quite a
sensation in cannonville i shall be de-
lighted to marry you and miss west im-
mediately poor thing it was sad most
sad and i congratulate her on obtaining a
husband of such sterling integrity as your-
self mr wentworth

  i guess im the person to be congrat-
ulated answered don

  suydam smiled you have two wit-
nesses i suppose he asked

  why theres my boy said hafiz
pray permit me to be the other in-
terposed wells it will be a great pleas-
ure i assure you if i may be allowed
why that will be charming of you
mr wells said the clergyman the
sooner the better youve got the ring

of course no ill bet-

  yes answered don laughing as he
produced the little circlet of gold i
bought it before i left cannonville and
kept it hidden about me all the while i
was in the brigands hands

  you see smiled sudh hafiz miss
west is getting a husband who has his
wits about him

the ceremony was over don couldnt
believe it no extraordinary change
had taken place in lorna standing at his
side smiling and apparently fully re-
stored to her normal health and he
the phantom hand



felt just the same odd that one could
be married and feel no different

  jolly mr suydam had kissed the bride
and was preparing to depart when abner
wells gestured to don and hafiz to step
aside what you said about coming to

terms- he began im ready this

has got to be settled his face was agi-
tated can you gentlemen come around
to my apartment at once and talk things
over

  don looked at hafiz the persian
had an inspiration he turned to the
clergyman

  its unfortunate he said but a most
important matter of business has cropped
up concerning miss west i wonder
whether we couldnt ask you to stay with
her here for half an hour while we are
gone youll understand its a matter

that wont permit of delay--

  i can quite understand suydam re-
sponded i shall be more than delighted
to remain here with miss west-come
come my dear friend you mean mrs
wentworth-until you gentlemen are
back

  don went up to loma and explained
but the girl looked at him a little re-
proachfully

  must you leave me dear she asked
imploringly

  for half an hour-three-quarters at
the most said don its something
that cropped up-i cant tell you now
dear but its unavoidable

  i suppose you must then don said
the girl but i shall be afraid all the
while you are gone i dont ever want us
to be separated again as long as we live
i hope we never shall be dearest
responded don youre an angel to
stand for it at such a time but you
wont be afraid with mr suydam

  no i wont be afraid with mr suy-
dam answered the girl mechanically

  i have my car outside said wells

we can reach my apartment in five
minutes

  they went out it was already grow-
ing dark hafiz got in beside wells don
seated himself in the rear and in a few
minutes they parked outside wellss apart-
ment in one of the finest apartment-
houses in cannonville

  my sister keeps house for me said
wells but shes out this evening and we
shall not be disturbed

the elevator deposited them on the
fifth floor and wells opened his
door and ushered them in the living- 
room showed the tastes of a gentleman
and a scholar the rugs and color scheme
were of the finest old prints hung on
the walls and the library was not of the
kind that is purchased in sets wholesale

  abner wells waved don and sudh
hafiz to chairs and drew up his own op-
posite them he looked at them in his
searching way saying nothing for a
while and they looked back at him
abner wells the blue-stocking politician
and reformer was a man of considerable
intelligence

  you think youve got me cornered
he said slowly showing his teeth im
not so sure what do you want to pro-
pose

  weve got you on that traction deal
of course said sudh hafiz

  abner wells uttered a cool laugh so
youve found the reformer as bad as the
rest of them eh he asked i rate your
intelligence higher than that gentlemen
you may have all the papers you like but
youll never bring that home to me now
between friends-at least provisional
friends-what next

  i am speaking in the dark said sudh
hafiz and his voice took on a purr of
complacency i dont know whether in
the matter of the conspiracy to send west
to the gallows-


weird tales

  i refuse to accept that word shouted
abner who had evidently recovered from
his first fears and had devised what he
considered a way out of his dilemma

  -whether you have the goods on

godfrey moore or whether he has the
goods on you but in either case i think
you will read a warning in the deaths of
moroni and walstein

  how do i know walsteins dead
demanded abner

  if you dont know youll soon learn
of his disappearance come let us have
done with fencing

  whats your game lay your cards on
the table

  my game as you call it answered
don is to clear a dead mans name
abner wells looked at him closely
excuse me for a moment gentlemen
he said and left the room within two
minutes he was back

  i accept your statement that walstein
is dead he said he was shaking in
spite of his affected nonchalance what
do you offer

  sudh hafiz leaned forward i know
he said that you were the least guilty in
the conspiracy against poor west this
time abner wells made no attempt to re-
fute the charge help us bring the
proofs home to godfrey moore help us
for your own sake for otherwise he will
assuredly kill you

  he turned to don i think in such
event we can offer mr wells immunity
he asked

  don nodded ill pledge myself to
that he answered

  and how pray do you imagine that
godfrey moore has the power to take my
life asked abner i am no fool
gentlemen though i may have given you
the impression of being one

  i dont know answered sudh hafiz
how far moore has initiated you into his
devilish practises but i do know that you

like many another apparently hard-boiled
business man are well aware that there
is another world than this you have con-
sulted mediums habitually you have seen
and talked to the spirit of your dead
son-

  oh god cried abner wells and
dropped his face into his hands when
he raised it a moment later it was the
face of an old man drawn and gray

  gentlemen he whispered that devil
has me in his power yes i know-i
know that he encompassed the death of
west and i know how do you

  the persian nodded he can do that
to you he said just as he sent wests
astral to kill captain morse while poor
west was drugged and unconscious in his
house so he can send yours upon another
hellish mission

  i have no proofs no papers that will
incriminate moore but ill help you
ill do everything i can god this has
been a long nightmare what do you
want me to do

  when the time comes ill tell you
answered hafiz for the present we
have your pledge and you have ours of
immunity

they left wells seated in his chair
looking ten years older than when
they had entered the room with him and
walked back briskly toward the house of
sudh hafiz

  we didnt learn much said don
no and i think wells was telling the
truth when he said he had no proofs
against moore but at least we have
found out where he stands and even if
he breaks his pledge i think we have
taken the life out of his opposition now
my dear fellow you must have a whole
month of honeymoon with that little bride
of yours if you see any evidences of
trance if her father takes possession of
her ignore him he will not harm you
the phantom hand



  when you come back we shall en-
deavor to get into touch with lemuel
west in other ways and bring him to a
realization of the fact that he is dead and
only furthering moores devilish schemes
by letting himself be used as a tool by him
meanwhile i shall be at work in his in-
terests and lornas

  how do you think it may be possible
to get into touch with him asked don

  i believe answered sudh hafiz
that if we are unable to bring him into
touch with us on earth one of us may
have to go down into the shadow world in
order to communicate with him more
freely but that is a fearful journey for
a living man to make and few indeed
have made it successfully and returned as
the old greek myth of orpheus attests
but that is part of the training we received
from my master who is even now watch-
ing from his retreat in my own country i
know how to do it

  you said one of us said don
im willing-anything that i can do to
clear poor wests name

  sudh hafiz hesitated wentworth he
answered i am able to speak to you
more frankly than hitherto it is strange
but the akashic mirror in which i can
get fragmentary glimpses of the imme-
diate future seems to indicate that you
will be that one i dont exactly under-
stand it but i foresee that all will in the
end be well his tone became less
grave i believe that when you return
mrs wentworth will be fully restored to
health he said have you made your
plans for the trip

  im thinking of driving along the
coast road to florida answered don i
want to motor hard and fast for a few
days so as to get as far from here as pos-
sible and give loma a complete change
of scene

  a very wise decision youll use my
car of course

  why stammered don i was think-
ing of buying one tonight i really
couldnt deprive you-

  no deprivation i must insist on it
just bring her out of the house step into
the car and away you go and here i
must say au revoir wentworth he
added

  they had reached the outside of the
temple from within which a soft glow
was proceeding three or four persons
were already ascending the steps a man
looked back and nodded to sudh hafiz

  yes this is one of the nights for our
regular services said the persian and
im a little late as it is convey my warm-
est regards to your bride wentworth and
when you return come straight to the
house

  sudh hafiz gripped his hand and be-
fore don could urge him to come in and
say good-bye to lorna he had passed up
the steps into the interior of the temple
from which the soft strains of the organ
had begun to roll

  standing there looking after him don
suddenly became conscious of fears for
lorna could anything have happened
to her in the short time he had been away
his heart beginning to pulsate violently
he hurried to the door of hafizs house

he was immensely relieved when at
his knock old mr suydam opened
it to him almost immediately for the
smiling benevolent face of the clergy-
man told him that all was well

  well here you are back already ex-
claimed suydam youll be surprized
to hear that your little wife is sleeping
soundly poor child she seemed all tired
out with the excitement of being mar-
ried she asked me to lower the lights
said that they hurt her eyes you must
be very gentle and patient with her at
first wentworth but i know that being
married to the man of her heart is the best


weird tales

tonic she could have he added smiling

  but fear was again hammering at the
gates of dons heart why had lorna
asked to have the lights lowered was
it possible that lemuel west was again
obsessing her within an hour of their
marriage he strode swiftly into the
drawing-room

  then his relief was like a physical pang
as he saw loma his very own loma
asleep curled up in the big chair and her
own sweet face instead of that ghastly
hate-distorted one of lemuel wests that
he had been afraid of finding

  he stood there for a moment looking
down at her in the ecstasy of his reaction
he vowed that he would win her back to
health and strength and happiness he
would fight the devil moore and beat him
but for the present-only loma

  she opened her eyes and smiled at him
 knew that you were there even when
i was asleep she said i had rather a
bad dream don i dreamed that they
had taken you away from me-or me
from you

  never dearest answered don im
with you he knelt down beside her
for a moment took her hand and pressed
it to his lips always loma do you
feel well enough to start now

  yes im well enough im really
quite well except that i have such
wretched dreams but im not going to
have them any more im quite resolved
on that i do feel tired but i shall be so
happy with you where are we going
don

  to florida answered don do
you like the idea of that loma

  i think it will be great she answered
enthusiastically but where are we go-
ing to stop tonight

  at evansville do you know it its
only forty miles from here and we can
be there in almost no time theres a

good hotel there too and as soon as
ive got you to bed im going out to buy
you a toothbrush and anything else that
you require he added laughing

  loma rose and put her arms about his
neck youre always so good to me
don she said

  she was so slight and frail he felt a
rush of pity impulsively he picked her
up and strode with her past the genially
waving mr suydam and carried her to
the sedan which stood outside

  im going to put you in the rear seat
dearest he said youll be able to
sleep there

  he tucked her into a big mg that was
folded on the seat and made her lean
her head against the comer of the
cushions he closed the door got in the
front and took the wheel in another
moment the car was rolling softly away
along the main road that ran inland
about four miles from the coast

once or twice he glanced around to
see that lorna was sleeping comfort-
ably but his heart misgave him as he
realized how frail she looked he would
have to take the greatest care of her it
was going to be a longer task than he had
thought bringing her back to health and
a month would be barely long enough

  he would take her to some seaside
place in florida-not the florida of the
tourists but the strip that lies west of the
floridan peninsula there in the bracing
air with the warm sun and the sea lorna
would come back to her old self and for-
get the dreadful tragedy that had seared
her life

  and he himself resolved to put all
thoughts of the matter out of his mind
till his return he too had been under
a fearful strain and that strain must
necessarily react upon loma

  he looked back again but he could see
nothing but the faint outlines of her now
the phantom hand



for they had left the street lights far be-
hind and were passing through the des-
olate pine forests thank heaven he must
be half-way to evansville he pressed
down the accelerator and sent the sedan
up to fifty-five sixty sixty-five miles an
hour

  but what was he hurrying for there
was nothing wrong with lorna he was
fleeing as if she was mortally ill and in
need of a doctor that was absurd he
slowed down again came to a stop looked
back

   lorna he called

   there came no answer she was asleep
she must be asleep he told himself he
leaned back over the rear of the front
seat and laid his hand upon the rug

   lorna dear he said

   no answer still he could just see the
outlines of her body but they were dim-
mer than they had any right to be under
that brilliant moon he touched the rug
again god it folded inward it col-
lapsed as if there were nothing under it

  and suddenly don became aware that
there was nothing under it lorna was
gone

  fallen out of the car no the door
was not only closed fast but locked and
yet she was not there frantically don
climbed over the rear seat and the rug
collapsed under his hands showing the
seat beneath it

  don stood back in horror trying to
make his brain function lorna had been
there and was gone and she could not
have fallen out of the car she seemed to
have dematerialized into thin air

   and as he stood back he saw that she
was there after all a phantom her eyes
closed in sleep looking infinitely weak
and wan and tired

   he clutched at her and his arms passed
through her and met

  a wild cry broke from him he

thought he was going mad he shrank
back there she was again huddled up
in the corner but this time she opened
her eyes and smiled at him and extended
her arms toward him

  and again his arms encountered only
empty air

  then of a sudden as he stood there
he heard voices infinitely far away low
and yet clear and seeming to emanate
from within his brain rather than from
any objective place it was like voices
heard over the telephone when a connec-
tion is faulty

  you tell me im with you i tell you
im with him im in the car with him
i love him hes my husband

  and that was lornas voice and as
she spoke once more the astral double in
the car smiled at don as if it responded
instantly to the thoughts of the living
woman far away

  i tell you youre in my power youll
do as i tell you if you ever want to see
him again and that was the voice of
godfrey moore

  im in your power no longer came
lornas voice sweet but faint i was in
your power once but im awake now i
want him

   ill bring him to you

  youll bring him-here

  ill bring him here to show you that
i have complete control over him after
that youll let your father come to me
not while i live

  not while you live answered god-
frey moores voice mockingly and then
suddenly don was aware that it was ad-
dressing him

  you fool it said to have thought
you could thwart me your life was in
my hands last night what did you want
to interfere for im giving you your
chance now your last chance get out
and stay out lorna is with me she


weird tales

slipped out of the car when you slowed
down a mile from my house on the upper
road and i left her double with you to
mock you watch it watch carefully
don wentworth his voice took on the
singsong of a conjurer now you see
it now you dont

  it was horrible but the astral form of
lorna seemed responsive to moores
words one moment he saw her in the
corner of the rear seat smiling at him
the next she was gone

  and now she was gone without re-
turning and moores mocking voice was
in dons ears again

  you thought to corrupt abner wells
you fatuous fool playing with fire and
not knowing it i offer you your last
chance of life drive drive like the devil
and be out of the state by morning
otherwise you die

  liar screamed don he lost all
self-control he pounded the cushions
with his fists as if they had been god-
frey moore tiar and devil im com-
ing to you if all the fiends of hell are at
your back

  he heard moores faint laugh of de-
rision and fainter still a cry of appeal
from lorna

  come along wentworth came
moores answer i knew youd come
theres a warm welcome waiting for
you youll learn what it means to cross
me youll find your wife here only it
wont be quite the same as you expect
theres a crossroad a mile back from
where you are that runs right into my pri-
vate road a hundred yards from my house
come and welcome

  the voice died away don was star-
ing at the empty seat in front of him

he turned the car and drove back
found the crossroad that he had
passed without noticing and drove like a
madman through the pines southward

toward the sea was he crazed had
lorna fallen from the car after all it
mattered nothing don knew that so
long as godfrey moore lived one living
devil bestrode the earth and he meant to
throttle him with his own hands if he
were hanged for it

  on and on along the dirt trail through
the desolate pine forests don drove fury
in his heart and madness in his brain
until of a sudden he saw moores private
road before him and moores house
ablaze with lights and he was forced to
jam on the brakes with all his might to
prevent shooting across the concrete way
into the mud flats beyond

  with grinding screeching brakes bon
brought the car to a standstill at the very
edge of the concrete backed and turned
looking round from force of habit as he
straightened out the car he saw the shad-
owy outlines of lornas double behind
him once again

  and again he heard those faint voices

 he is coming to me	--

  i told you i had complete control over
him that i would bring him

  hes coming of his free will because
he loves me

  his love will avail you nothing

  it will avail me everything because
our love is stronger than your evil powers
my eyes are open now you thought
youd killed the soul in me but it exists
and it defies you

  don heard godfrey moores scornful
laugh ring out then it seemed as if
lorna was at the phantom telephone
alone

  don dearest don where are you
i feel you near me but i can not see you
im here lorna don whispered and
mad with eagerness though he was to go
on to moores house he could not but
wait there until she had finished speaking
and now he could see her double in the

                    w t-
the phantom hand



rear seat again smiling at him involun-
tarily he put out his hand to touch her
but it passed through empty air don
knew that was not lorna only a simulac-
rum having no more of her personality
than a picture might have had it was
her love for him that had flung it there
upon die screen of the night

  im here lorna don whispered
again

  go back don he is stronger than
we are he can kill our bodies but he
can never kill our souls

  im coming to you lorna my place
is at your side if he can kill us well die
together

   the answering sigh was very faint and
far away next moment the simulacrum
had vanished don was alone

   he drove the car through the gates and
up the drive beneath the live-oaks trail-
ing their festoons of moss brought it to a
halt before he hcjseand leaped out
before him stood the open entrance doors
and a shaft of brilliant light shone out

  with three bounds don was up the
steps and inside ive come he cried
im here godfrey moore im here
there came no answer and don
pushed through into the long drawing-
room with the radio set in the corner and
the blue velvet portieres loma he
cried loma but the room beyond
was empty and the next and the next
and beyond that the door gave upon a
passage leading into the kitchen on one
side and running straight past it to
another door some distance away

  the house seemed empty but as don
called lornas name again he thought he
heard the faint mocking echo of moores
laugh he grew silent and the laugh was
not repeated

   infuriated he shouted his challenge
im here godfrey moore im here he
called again you dared me to come
w t-

and im here to fight it out with you to

the last

  still silence and don turned and began
stamping through the rooms on the lower
floor shouting moores name and lornas
alternately but there was no one there
and presently he found himself back in
the passage

  he stopped irresolutely behind him
he could see the staircase running up to
the bedrooms but it was not likely that
moore or loma would be there his
heart sank as it occurred to him that
moore might have been playing a trick on
him that lorna had been spirited away
far from the house that he had been
drawn there on a fools errand

  moore damn you you shant escape
me by god ill follow you to the ends
of the earth he cried where are you
skulking

  is that you wentworth moores
bland voice sounded suddenly as if in
dons ear so that he whirled about only
to realize that he was still alone

  im here where are you shouted
don

  pray excuse me my dear fellow i
didnt expect youd be here so soon yes
i have your wife with me poor child
she came to me in sudden panic she
didnt like the idea of being married-
to you she slipped out of your car and
dashed away through the pines-

  you can save your breath moore no
need to lie cried don

  why wentworth thats a word i
dont like answered moores voice
blandly but i realize that the situation
must be a painful one for you lets talk
it over like gentlemen i cant come to
you for the moment can you come to
me

  ill go to hell for you moore said
don and he heard a throaty chuckle it
response


 weird tales

  odd that you should have tried all
doors but the right one wentworth the
one at the end of the passage there
straight in front of you its my labora-
tory my den whatever you like to call it
don without replying strode down the
corridor until he reached the door now
he saw a tiny window in the wall over-
head admitting a modicum of light and
through it he could see the low bluff at
the back of the house he had not
guessed the building ran back so far
moores den must be actually hollowed
out of the rocky bluff above him and
deep in the earth

one moment with his hand upon the
door don hesitated it was not
fear it was rather the realization that he
was on the verge of committing lorna and
himself irrevocably that he was about to
step consciously into a trap

  he knew it but the surge of blind fury
that filled him blinded him made him
reckless of the consequences

  he flung the door open and passed
through

  nothing darkness but don heard
the door click fast behind him and he
shouted again im here moore show
yourself dont skulk in the dark do
your worst im ready for you

  again he heard that throaty chuckle
and then of a sudden the room was filled
with blinding dazzling light but it was
not ordinary light intensified to the nth
power it was a light that could be felt
that exerted pressure on all sides of him
at the same time light that seemed to
hold him like a trap of steel wires and at
the same time made it impossible for him
to open his eyes

  he tried to take a step forward he
tried to extend his hands to grope his
way he could move but it was as if the
wire trap moved with him still imprison-

ing him gradually he managed to get
his eyes partly open the light was less
intolerable it seemed to be exercising
pressure upon his eyelids but it did not
sear his eyes

  minutes went by in silence little by
little don got his eyes open at last he
could see now the light was no longer
dazzling but it was brighter than any
light he had ever seen-brighter in a dif-
ferent way a mellow soft and infin-
itely piercing light that seemed to pen-
etrate through and through him

  now don could take in his surround-
ings he was in a small room excavated
in the rock for overhead was rock shored
up by beams there was nothing in the
room but glass the walls were covered
with glass mirrors set at slightly different
angles so that don could see himself
duplicated and reduplicated a hundred
times could see every inch of his body
from all possible angle

  in front -oftum was a long triangula
frame of what looked like glass extend-
ing horizontally the entire width of the
room and laid about four feet from the
floor being supported upon a number of
tripods behind this prism the light
streamed through a narrow slit in the far
wall yet it was so intolerably bright that
it illumined the entire room 

  on the far side of the prism it entered
white sunlight but from the side nearer
don it emerged in the seven component
colors into which sunlight is dissolved by
a prism violet indigo blue green yel-
low orange red each color was perfectly
distinct and running through them were
the black lines of the solar spectrum

  at each end there was a gap and don
knew enough of physics to be aware that
these represented the invisible ultra-violet
and ultra-red rays respectively

  there came a click a purring sound
and suddenly don found himself held as
the phantom hand



in a vise new beams of light were
streaming in on him from every side
pressing upon him so that movement was
all but impossible

  and in that light don had a singular
feeling as if his bones were being turned
to marrow he felt weak and helpless
he had neither the will nor the power to
struggle

  again there sounded moores malicious
chuckle as if coming from within the
room well youre here wentworth
came the taunting words you stepped
into the trap theres no black magic
here my friend simply a new scientific
process of which i am the inventor
though i do not intend to patent it

  the disintegrating powers of light
rightly applied are generally known
the earthworm shrivels up and dies when
exposed for a moderate time to sunlight
light kills most germs and you my
dear friend though your knowledge is not
profound have probably heard of ecto-
plasm that exudes from the body of a
medium during a seance if so you are
aware that the slightest approach to sun-
light causes it to disappear immediately

  this ectoplasm--pardon me if i am
explicit but it is a pleasure to have a mod-
erately intelligent man to talk to-this
ectoplasm has been analyzed and has
been found to be nothing mysterious or
ghostly but the primal basis of all mat-
ter it is subject therefore to all the con-
ditions of the physical world the light
which is now being applied to yourself
wentworth is of a nature discovered by
myself it is of a series of ray lengths
midway between sunlight and the x-ray
ordinarily invisible but made visible by
certain processes into which i need not
enter

   its purpose is to effect such a disinte-
gration of your own ectoplasmic contents
that they will be automatically disunited

from your physical organism in briefer
words this is an apparatus for separating
-painlessly separating-the body from
its double or astral

  since you have challenged me went-
worth it is my intention to reduce you to
the after-death condition in which state
i hope to utilize your services for certain
purposes of my own after which i
promise you that i shall give you back
your body again and leave you free to
depart

  again that chuckle came from moores
lips don who had hardly understood
what the man was saying and only knew
that he was trapped in some infernal
mechanism flung all his strength into a
desperate effort to free himself

  if he could only reach the prism not
a dozen feet in front of him smash it or
at least hurl it from its supporting tri-
pods    but his limbs were as heavy
as lead and it was with the utmost diffi-
culty that he was able to raise his arms an
inch

  brighter grew the light and more intol-
erable more and more intensely came
that rending feeling he could no longer
stir now he was in no pain but an in-
tense weakness and lethargy held him and
he would have fallen but for the feeling
of being supported on all sides by steel
wires

  now strange prickles were coursing
through all his arteries and sinews his
body began to grow numb cold dead
only his brain was alive but that seemed
more vividly alive tiian ever before
memories of his life down to minute and
long-forgotten details rushed through it

  then ensued a brief period of uncon-
sciousness suddenly don awoke he
found himself looking straight into his
own eyes

  he was exterior to his body which
stood a sagging lifeless thing in the


weird tales

middie of the floor and suddenly as if
released from the thongs of light that
held it it dropped it lay upon the floor
inert and to all appearances dead

  and don standing over it had never
felt so well so alive in every limb

for a few moments staring at the
thing that had been he he could not
understand then suddenly the truth
was borne in upon him he was exterior-
ized he was what the world called dead
he had become a phantom-yet a phan-
tom that retained all the emotions all the
will and impulses of a living man all the
intense desire to find lorna and save her
from this fiend

  suddenly he was aware that godfrey
moore was in the room moore was in
evening dress he held a half-smoked
cigar in his hand and he was looking at
the lifeless body upon the floor he
raised one foot shod in patent leather
and kicked it meditatively

  but there was a change in moores ap-
pearance when don had first seen him
he had been struck by the mans benign
appearance now though his face was
unaltered don seemed to see him from
some interior point of vision and the look
on moores face was that of a devil

  moore in the room within reach of
dons fist ignorant apparently that he
was in his victims power

  don drew back his right fist and struck
with all his might straight from the
shoulder it was a haymaker that would
have felled a strong man and staggered a
dempsey to dons dismay the blow
failed to perturb moore in the slightest
his fist passed straight through moores
face and stood out behind his head

  a cry of utter horror broke from dons
lips at last he knew

  moore raised his head and looked at

don fixedly a sneering chuckle brcke
from him

  i can just see you my friend he said
you have taken a slight element of phys-
ical matter with you so that the exper-
iment has not been wholly a success but
you are sufficiently dematerialized for my
purposes and now wentworth -
moore thrust his face forward till it was
almost touching dons-now you are
going to learn what it means to try to
cross me

  he raised one hand revealing a sort
of disk of black metal not unlike a
watch he flicked his fingers and a long
tongue of white flame leaped from it
stinging don like a whip

  don hurled himself upon moore again
his fists striking him madly but he en-
countered only empty air and again
and again moore snapped his fingers and
the white tongues leaped at don inflict-
ing unendurable pain

  down dog laughed moore down
through the floor youll find some old
friends of yours below

  again don leaped and again he reeled
back in agony anywhere to obtain ref-
uge and surcease from pain

  down shouted moore pointing to
the solid boards

  as don looked at them they seemed
to dissolve the room was growing shad-
owy at the mere thought of obeying
the floor vanished don found himself
descending into a dark crypt lit by the
faintly phosphorescent forms of human
shadows

  exhausted but not cowed he crouched
like a wild beast against the rock wall if
this was death he had never felt more
alive

   don wentworth is in moores power his very soul
at the mercy of the black magician and lorna lost
to him can sudh hafiz save him  what hope is there
of regaining his bride and inflicting retribution upon
the arch-criminal but godfrey moore has a diabol-
ical scheme to involve all in a common ruin be sure

  ver times threshold

by howard wandrei

a weird story of the fourth dimension-a tale of speeding years and an eery
experiment in professor capals laboratory

  a clock ticking in an empty house

         what might that bode finch
turned to the girl and said the
agent told me this place has been closed
up for four years

  she nodded it was an undeniable tick-
ing the heavy clipped chucking sound of
a large timepiece the sound came from
the one unexplored room on the ground
floor and finch walked with the girl
toward the door of the room with some
curiosity

  the uncovered furnishings of the old
house were gray with dust there had
been no caretaker for these four years
and its present condition gave it a cheap
place in the market even among prevail-
ing low prices the dusty furnishings
were of a rather respectable nature some
of them rich enough to give the girls eyes
an incipient sparkle and those of the
room in the left wing which they were
approaching were especially interesting
subconsciously finch noted that the door
of this room was peculiar among those
they had tried on the ground floor in its
standing open the two paused on the
threshold of the room and looked in hark-
ing to the ticking of the clock

  a heavy table in the mathematical cen-
ter of the room supported a large retort
filled with a liquid colored a pale apple-
green the glass arm of the retort ap-
peared to be depositing this fluid by slow
drops into a fair-sized graduated glass
whose capacity must have been about
equal to the liquid in the retort a drop
now hung from the extended retort arm

minute accumulations gradually inviting
its fall finch looked at the litter of test
tubes and other apparatus on the table and
glanced at the book-lined walls

  capals laboratory he said the girl
looked at him inquiringly

  professor capal he said again he
used to live in this house and it looks as
though he worked in this room

  oh he used to teach at the university

  yes he sort of disappeared four
years ago and the house has been vacant
since

  loud ticking filled the room and now
the two watching the clock noted its pecu-
liar character with some astonishment it
was of unusually heavy construction and
had a broad engraved face set with an-
tique numerals around this face the two
hands were describing arcs with furious
irregularity the minute hand passed in
rapid movement past the numeral three
stopped dead and retreated almost to the
top of the face then both minute and
hour hands disappeared in a blurred whirl
the heavy ticking became confused the
sound was full of unaccountable interrup-
tions and double strikings and displayed
as many irregularities as the movement of
the hands the weights in the case
changed position uncertainly and the mo-
tion of the pendulum could not be fol-
lowed it seemed to appear ubiquitously
in its arc the whir of the machinery be-
hind the face suddenly stopped finch
automatically took out his watch for the
correct time and found to his surprize that

both gave the same hour precisely 

  at this moment the girl stepped into
the room to examine the clock more close-
ly as she crossed the threshold and
finch was about to step after her the re-
tort deposited a drop of the green stuff in
the fractionally filled beaker on the table
the hesitating hands of the clock leaped
and the girl vanished

  finch looked about blankly

  sherna-- he called questioningly

  the ticking sounded rhythmically now
clear now confused as with the sound of
another escapement striking somewhat
faster the hands hesitated whirled
stopped swung back and forth like the
steadying needle of a compass

  sherna finch ran into the room and
looked about him breathless and fright-
ened and now the clock ticked with pre-
cision but terrifying things were occur-
ring about the house he turned to the
rooms long windows and looked at the
sky it had blackened in less than a min-
ute it was night he looked amazed at
the stars and then turned his shocked eyes
from immediately succeeding daylight
the sun had burst like thunder through
the belt of orion

  night again succeeded the sun be-
came a mere arc of fire across the sky-a
yellow-golden rainbow and night was an
instants blur of darkness the hands of
the ticking clock followed precisely the
progress of the sun the alternation of
night and day fell swifter and swifter and
with finch at the window it was like look-
ing out of the quickly winking eye of a
camera a time camera the succession
of light and darkness blended into a tone
of twilight under a gray sky sliced lower
and lower by the arc of the sun as cold
crept into the room and snow fell abroad
over the land then the arching sun
mounted the sky so rapidly that its many
appearances seemed one broad band of
fire in the sky

  now it was midsummer and the hands
of the clock ceased their crazy whirl and
hesitated performing aimless arcs back
and forth across the circled numbers of
the face this happening had almost the
appearance of malice as if to allow the
man time to take account of his disaster

finch looked about him the room
seemed the same there was a thicken-
ing of the dust if anything he wrote
finch in the dust on a free end of the
apparatus-littered table and noticed the
new accumulation of green stuff at the
end of the retort arm

  capal had been a physicist and this ar-
rangement of liquid and glass looked like
one of his remote experiments in chemis-
try finch thrust his forefinger into the
liquid the beaker had collected and with-
drew it hastily the stuff was so cold it
burned and pain rushed up his arm like a
train of exploding needles in the sum-
mer sky the sun marked the month as
june but finch and the girl had entered
the room in early august he believed
nothing but accepted everything under
the name of phenomena

  at the university capal had propagated
a number of scientifically malodorous
ideas and was accounted a trifle mad
finch pleasantly conjectured that the pro-
fessor had been tricked by his own queer
notions and wondered what his disap-
pearance had to do with his laboratory

  the retort was mounted upon legs that
separated it from the table by almost an
inch to one side was a clockwork mech-
anism screwed firmly to the table pro-
jecting from the side was a free metal arm
to the end of which was fastened a small
plate of some reddish composition that
glinted with metal filings this plate
would swing under the base of the retort
but a test-tube rack had fallen and blocked
its progress copper wires led from bind-
ing-posts on the clockwork to a series of
over times threshold



jars of colorless liquid ranged along the
side of the apparatus

  the girl had vanished before his eyes
and he himself had vanished from his
own time where was she where ca-
pal was and capal finch had good
nerves and knew the uselessness of dash-
ing about looking for the girl aimlessly
he was caught in a trap and the spring
was set by capal the phenomena that
played in this room were incident to the
professors clutter of glass and clockwork
and it was by means of these that he
would find normality he was ready to
follow any adventure through to its com-
pletion and now ascertained that the
clockwork was in order by pushing out the
metal arm to the limit of its swing the
composition plate was carried forward by
clicking little wheels until it met the test-
tube rack again

  as he was about to remove the rack he
noticed the arm of the retort and decided
to start evenly by cleaning off the small
quantity of liquid that had collected at its
mouth his finger tip wiped the glass and
at the contact his arm jerked convulsively
with electric shock as he caught sight of
the girl standing opposite him looking
about wildly

  finch retreated from the table con-
fusedly and called the girls name the
clocks ticking blurred into one contin-
uous sound of speaking metal and the
hands spun hazily the room rocked and
reeled again the world was in twilight
and in the speeding seasons finch alter-
nately shook with cold and perspired in
summer heat he sneezed violently he
was aware of a dim avalanchian roar that
clarified and advanced portentously the
old house crashed about his ears having
run into complete decay in a matter of
minutes and he choked in a chaos of dust
and falling rotten timbers

  now he found himself prostrated
among ruins that dwindled and supported

vegetation even before his eyes as he
scrambled to his feet on a level of crum-
bled wood and mortar howling chaos
dinned in his ears and then the world was
calm and he was looking out over a late
autumn wilderness

  there was no house there was no city
about him and an ancient cottonwood
sank its wrinkled trunk in the ground
where the table had stood a terrific
shock tumbled him to the ground and
when he arose the world was cold and the
sun directly overhead was a great dim-
glowing mass that shed at most a red twi-
light

  far off on the horizon was the glow of
flame a creeping blanket of smoke
marked some great fire about a hundred
yards away standing beneath another
huge cottonwood was the figure of a man
anxiously examining the place all around

  he wore tattered clothes and spectacles
reflected light as he turned his head a
great beast of some odd canine species
tightened a leash he gripped in one hand
the animal saw finch and growled the
man looked up and shouted whereupon
the beast jumped against the leash and
man and dog beat their way up the knoll
toward finch all his skin prickled and
his throat stiffened in fright

  stop he screamed

  im capal shouted the other dont
move you cant move

  finch shuddered whitely he heard a
confusion of syllables something about
clockwork and looked around dazed at
the suddenly present room of the old
house a drop was hanging from the arm
of the retort it fell sparkled globularly
on the table of liquid in the glass and
then became part of it as he hastily ran
through the door and sprawled on the
floor outside he thought he heard the girl
call his name at which he raised his
abraded cheek from the floor and looked


weird tales

back but the room was empty he lay
there for long and long sleeping heavily
through the early hours of the morning

he wakened with the sun pouring
through the doorway shafting the
spot his body occupied his face lay
closely against the floor his cheek hurt
with raw soreness

  god god god he said and turned
stiffly to look into the room sitting up
a drop of green fell from the retort and
the girls body appeared on the floor
twisted angularly

  sherna he started to his feet and
she disappeared he stopped at the
threshold muttering to himself the dust
in which he had written his name he
noted grimly was undisturbed then
burying his face in his arms and leaning
against the wall he listened to the aim-
less staccato chucking of the clock

  the sportive changes in the room
mocked any reasoning and finch was
hungry after walking around the
empty house for a time absently combing
his disordered hair with his fingers he
left the place slowly and took his way to
a near-by restaurant the reality of food
made capals laboratory seem exceedingly
remote but the girl was gone where

  was that reallycapal he had seen run-
ning up that lonely knoll what cursed
beast was that with him

  this time finch circled the house and
stood on the ledge that footed the win-
dows of the laboratory he could hear
the clock ticking through the panes like
a mechanical heart otherwise every-
thing was quiet the windows were curi-
ous in themselves they didnt open and
the panes were of quartz-glass the place
was built solidly and would last for a
long time he glued his ear to the glass
and listened to capals strange clock for a
few minutes and then peered closely at
the only other significant object visible-

the retort at the end of its arm was a
glimmer of green liquid

  he dropped from the window and
walked across the unkept lawn to the front
steps here he looked at his watch and
noted that the girl had been absent for
nearly sixteen hours he had awakened
at about six oclock just as a drop had
fallen last night one fell at five when
they entered the room and again at about
ten because of the modicum he removed
with his finger it took about four hours
for one drop to accumulate granting one
had fallen while he had been asleep so
his worried face suddenly straightened
he had seen the girl when he touched the
retort and when the drop fell as he awak-
ened this morning and heard her voice as
he was leaving the room coincidences

  hurriedly leaving his seat on the stoop
he jumped the front steps he snatched
open the front door dashed madly down
the hall and cut through the living-room
into the left wing about ten feet from
the laboratory door he caught sight of the
girl lying in the same position in which he
had seen her last he shouted and dived
headlong through the yawning door as
another green drop fell into the beaker

  his body sprawled into the table and
he stood up dazed to find himself once
more in the room alone thereupon he
stumbled toward the door the capri-
cious clock again forecast the unknown
with its spinning hands and syncopated
ticking

the hill on which capals house was
built flattened and suffocating hu-
mid masses of foliage crowded the spongy
earth finch lying prone looked wear-
ily and worried on the blanketed peaty
leaves and vegetation covering the
ground and saw near his face black
beetles and a fat spider crawling horribly
a train of soft red insects about the size of
peas mounted his arm on their clinging
over times threshold



tentade-like legs and licked his shudder-
ing flesh with little red tongues like small
flames he shook them off and rising to
his feet stamped on the lot and dis-
patched the bloated spider and all the in-
sects within the area the room would
enclose then he fearfully returned to
the spot his body had occupied when he
first recognized this new change

  here he stood waiting patiently re-
solved that these things were so first
two objects can not occupy the same space
at the same time second every four
hours the retort deposited a magical green
drop in the receptacle under the arm and
time momentarily identified itself with the
fall of the drop it was either capals
scientific necromancy or coincidence and
finch didnt care to dispute existence with
the table or book-case and leaving the
room might mean never returning

  for four hours he would be lost in
time and therein he was prey to every-
thing about him he closed his eyes in a
savage agony of nostalgia a curious sen-
sation in his feet attracted his attention
looking down he saw the peat-blanketed
ground mounting his legs graspingly ail
around were palisades of trees and the
surface of the land was jungled with
brush and vines a huge creeper the size
of his wrist commenced life at the base of
a smooth-boled tree near by and careered
through the air with dizzy life whipping
and cracking as it grew the peat-level
mounted to his knees he stood stiffly
while a shaggy beast hurtled past him
pursued by a barking uproar of wild dogs
he listened to the snarling tragedy dully
the level of earth withdrew suddenly and
whole stands of trees disappeared

  time in retrograde cursing capals
genius he sat weakly on the ground as he
thought of going back and back and back
but there was little time after all to won-
der whether the influence of the lost pro-

fessors apparatus were limited or not
there was just time to see a stagnant ex-
panse of water soupy and green and
crawling with life the damp heavy at-
mosphere was unbearable upward
gushes of moisture-laden air choked his
lungs and spun his brain the sun flamed
whitely and the forest reeked and shim-
mered with wisps of steam then the
rushing vegetation swept in and buffeted
him so that he stood on his feet against
the billowing foliage a lithe active vine
whirled through the air and burst through
the fleshy part of his arm finch clutched
futilely at it crying out at the pain the
vine had already disappeared in the shut-
tling years

  another period was running to its
close finch looked at his watch and
stooped purposefully in one of times hes-
itating moments to pick up from the
ground a handy water-rotted root he
heard the ticking of the clock and the lab-
oratory of capals house formed instantly

  he stood anxiously eyeing the clock and
retort gripping the root the arm
gleamed greenly and a drop of liquid
hung ready to fall as the hands of the
clock ceased their spasmodic whirling and
swung back and forth over the twenty-
first hour since the phenomena had begun
finch gripped the root poised to throw
while the skipping noise of the clock re-
solved itself into regular heavy ticking
he looked eagerly for the girl and now
the hands were almost at a dead stop the
ticking became a slow hammering

  finch trembled with nervous accu-
racy he flung the root at the glass works
on the table as the body of the girl ap-
peared at his feet

  quickly he stooped to lift the girl from
the floor though speed was no longer
necessary the root struck the retort
squarely and smashed it into a green soup
of liquid and shattered glass the beaker

                      great chaugnar dreams and there is hate
                      and fury on its face

                       beyond the universe of stars

                    where red moons wane and swim
                    great chaugnar stirs and heaves its bulk
                    upon a craters rim

       ath mist

by captain george h daugherty jr

an eery story of the great war and an officer who thought he was

recreant to his trust

through the jagged stumps of
the argonne forest swirled the
mist of a november evening
lieutenant john blackmer u s infan-
try blundered into a clearing and stopped
to his bewildered gaze the trees assumed
fantastic shapes seemed to close around
him then to retreat far off in the eddying
fog the muffled popping of rifle fire he
had heard faintly some moments before
was silent the war and all the world
had vanished leaving him alone in a uni-
verse of grayness the heavy vapor lifted
a trifle so that he could see that he stood
on the edge of a shell hole beyond it was
the dim outline of a big tree broken off
near the ground as the cloud lifted
again the white wood of the broken trunk
showed in livid streaks on the other
side of the shell hole sprawled a dead
man with arms and legs extended wood-
enly like some broken puppet

  not so much weary as unutterably de-
pressed in spirits lieutenant blackmer
sank down upon a log for a time he
stared idly his mind as much a blank as
the grayness around him but always with
a terrible sense of despair clutching him
little by little his thoughts took definite
shape this was the end tonight or
tomorrow at the latest he would stumble
on his outfit or failing that be arrested as
a straggler then would come the in-
evitable questioning why had he become
lost from his command why had he not
carried out his orders

  for a moment a gleam of hope flashed
through his mind as the thought struck

him perhaps captain racker his com-
pany commander had been killed or
wounded might not his defection from
duty pass unnoticed then realization
rushed over him again like the icy waves
of the fog even if racker were dead
the three majors knew his story and the
lieutenant-colonel and the colonel at
this moment the regiment or what was
left of it would be digging in for the
night he was missed was being asked
for no doubt at this moment he
groaned or at least he thought he did
although no sound disturbed the silence
of the clearing they would think he was
dead no doubt and so would forget him
until he turned up for a minute he con-
sidered the possibility of desertion then
decided it was of no use the military
police would only pick him up and he
would have no defense as matters stood
he could at least claim that he had been
temporarily separated from his men or
stunned by a shell-burst if this were
only the first time that might do but it
wasnt the first time

   as he stared into the shifting eddies of
the mist he recalled vividly the colonels
headquarters the grave face of the c o
grizzled stern captain racker with heavy
eyebrows knit into a ferocious scowl the
solemn majors even the rubicund lieu-
tenant-colonel macnamee with an expres-
sion of pain on his round and usually
jovial countenance he heard again the
colonel

  lieutenant blackmer it plainly ap-
pears that you have failed in your duty

                                    


weird tales

for the second time you have become sep-
arated from the men in your command
leaving them in a perilous situation in the
face of the enemy i have heard that the
first time this happened there seemed to
be some extenuating circumstances but
this time we can not admit them the
only thing that saves you from a general
court-martial is the fact that corporal
jason of your command by extraordinary
presence of mind managed to lead your
patrol safely back to our lines i tell you
that if a man of your patrol had been
killed i would have no choice but to order
you under arrest i would do it now were
it not for the disgrace that would attach
to the entire regiment therefore i will
give you one more chance go back to
your company sir and try to remember
at least what you owe to this regiment if
not to yourself your men and your coun-
try one more such failure to do your
duty and i will see that you go to fort
leavenworth

  lieutenant blackmer remembered with
shame the episodes to which the colonel
referred not that he had meant to be a
coward nor was he entirely sure that he
was a coward twice he had been or-
dered to lead a night-patrol the first
time all went well until suddenly guttural
voices sounded in front machine-guns
clattered a german grappled with him
when he got free of the fellow by a stab
with his trench-knife and three shots from
his automatic the platoon was gone nor
did he find them until they blundered into
the american trench ten minutes after he
had wormed his way there none of
them had seen him struggling with the
german so that his story was incredulous-
ly received by captain racker the cap-
tain however said nothing about it that
time

  the second episode was worse black-
mer writhed mentally as he thought of

that night-the sudden star shells the
bursting grenades his dive into the shell
hole the paralyzing fear that prevented
him from leaving until it was too late to
rejoin the patrol this time captain
racker reported both episodes to the
colonel blackmer shuddered again

the fog had now lifted until it seemed
to hang in the limbs of the trees of
the clearing the light being stronger
the lieutenant noticed the dead body
again it lay on its back with its arms
flung wide and its face turned away so
that only a gray cheek was visible for a
moment the lieutenant had an impulse to
go over and make sure that the man was
dead then he noticed even at that dis-
tance the red splotch on the tunic and the
heavy grotesque posture of the corpse
no living body even in the soundest
sleep assumes the stuffed-doll attitudes of
death

  again he took up the thread of his rec-
ollections why had he failed again to-
day he had led his platoon out of their
fox-holes at the time of the jump-olf with
the fixed determination to keep the men
together and gain the objective nor had
he felt any especial fear even when they
went through the enemy barrage just as
they entered the wood there he had
seen two of his men blown to atoms and
three others wounded one horribly so
that he screamed and his screams fol-
lowed the platoon for a long time through
the trees there were snipers and ma-
chine-gunners in the woods twice the
platoon had to drop flat and worm their
way cautiously to flank the positions from
which came those deadly streams of lead
both times they lost heavily and both
times it was the lieutenant who led the
final rush and hurled the grenades which
put the machine-guns out of business with
the gunners sprawled across them re-
the death mist



calling these things blackmer again asked
himself was he a coward yet as he did
so he marvelled both at the thrill of com-
bat he had felt in the morning and at his
present desperate and hopeless depression

  again he resumed his recollections of
the battle so far all was clear and even
to his credit after the capture of the sec-
ond machine-gun he had reorganized the
platoon now reduced nearly half and
had sent runners to right and left these
returned in good time with reports of con-
tact established one of them carried a
message from captain racker to move
forward at once hs did so though the
undergrowth was very thick and a gray
mist had already begun to form what
then another furious barrage shell
bursts flaming red in the murk thunder-
claps of sound the shriek and hiss of
fragments it was just after this he re-
called that they must have run into a ger-
man company brown and gray figures
had grappled shouts screams the clatter
of rifle fire the booming of grenades all
seemed to mingle as in an endless night-
mare at first he was with his men then
they had evaporated he had gone in
frantic search of them once he was sud-
denly among a group of the enemy he
remembered in a flash their bucket-hel-
mets and bearded faces all about him
again he was almost atop of a machine-
gun that spat directly at him yet never
touched him    once more the mist
swirled over all until suddenly he rea-
lized that the battle was far away and he
was alone he knew not how or why

  looking up he saw that the fog was
nearly gone but that the forest would
soon be dark faint shots and the far-
away clatter of a machine-gun in front of
him showed in which direction the front
lay

he rose to go with the leaden feel-
ing that it was to his own execution
at the same time he wondered why he
seemed not to notice the weariness hun-
ger and faintness that usually tortured
him after such a day instead he felt only
a horrible despair

  all at once with intense amazement
he looked again about him    that
broken tree-had he not seen it topple
and fall leaving that bunch of splinters
on the stump like some fantastic clutch-
ing hand then he recognized the clear-
ing the platoon had passed that way in
the afternoon wat it not here that the
second rain of shells had caught them
just as the fog closed down and the
dead man-he must have been one of
blackmers own outfit

  feeling his own despair lighten in a
sudden wave of pity for the poor devil
lieutenant blackmer went toward the
body in this lonely place he thought the
corpse might easily escape notice and so
remain unburied while the man would be
listed for ever among the missing the
lieutenant could at least take one of the
neck-tags and give directions for the loca-
tion and proper burial of the body it
would be the last service he could render
any one of his men and that but a poor
return for his desertion of them in the
thick of the battle

  so thinking and again in the grip of
the deathly chill at the thought of his own
past and future lieutenant blackmer ap-
proached the dead man but what was
this-an officer could it be captain
racker blackmer bent over the corpse
then as the icy waves of the fog rolled
over him for the last time he realized the
cause of his despair the convulsed and
blood-stained features which stared at him
were his own

the story thus far

robert walton captain of a
ship seeking a passage through
 the arctic ocean saw a low car-
riage fixed on a sledge and drawn by
dogs pass over the ice-field to the north
in it sat a being which had the shape of
a man but apparently of gigantic stature

  the next morning after the ice had
broken he rescued from an ice-field an-
other man greatly emaciated only one
of his dogs remained alive for he had
been marooned for some time the man
was victor frankenstein a young scien-
tist who related to captain walton the
incredible story of his life and how he
came to be on the ice-floe

  frankenstein had lived in geneva with
his father and his adopted sister eliza-
beth to whom he was betrothed his
father sent him to school at ingolstadt
with his chum henry clerval there he
progressed in his studies of natural science
to such a point that he learned to create
life

  without taking clerval into his secret
frankenstein created a monster eight feet
tall and human in appearance taking his

materials from graveyards slaughter-
houses and dissecting-rooms the mon-
ster was so terrible to look upon that
frankenstein fled from it and the mon-
ster escaped

  abandoned by its creator the monster
made its way to the vicinity of franken-
steins home where he murdered frank-
ensteins younger brother william mak-
ing it appear that justine moritz a friend
of the family had committed the murder
justine was convicted and sentenced to
death while frankenstein knowing that
if he told the truth he would be con-
sidered a lunatic was forced to keep si-
lence

  frankenstein met the monster in a hut
in the alps and there the monster told
him how he had learned to talk by ob-
serving a peasant family for many months
and how he had changed from a being
with good impulses to a malevolent de-
mon because when he revealed himself
to the eyes of the peasants by entering
their cottage they had been so horrified
by his frightful appearance that they beat
him with sticks and drove him away and
all mens hands were raised against the
hideous monster



this story began in weird tales for may

jects that obstructed me and ranging
through the wood with a stag-like swift-
ness oh what a miserable night i
passed the cold stars shone in mockery
and the bare trees waved their branches
above me now and then the sweet voice
xf a bird burst forth amidst the universal
stillness all save me weie at rest or in
enjoymenfrt like the arch-fiend bore a
hell within me and finding myself un-
sympathized with wished to tear up the
trees spread havoc and destruction around
me and then to have sat down and en-
joyed the ruin

   but this was a luxury of sensation that
could not endure i became fatigued with
excess of bodily exertion and sank on the
damp grass in the sick impotence of de-
spair there was none among the myriads
of men that existed who would pity or
assist me and should i feel kindness to-
wards my enemies no from that
moment i declared everlasting war against
the species and more than all against
him who had formed me and sent me
forth to this insupportable misery

   the sun rose i heard the voices of
men and knew that it was impossible to
return to my retreat during that day ac-

cordingly i hid myself in some thick
underwood determining to devote the en-
suing hours to reflection on my situation

  the pleasant sunshine and the pure
air of day restored me to some degree of
tranquillity and when i considered what
had passed at the cottage i could not help
believing that i had been too hasty in my
conclusions i had certainly acted impru-
dently it was apparent that my conver-
sation had interested the father in my be-
half and i was a fool in having exposed
my person to the horror of his children
i ought to have familiarized the old de
lacey to me and by degrees to have dis-
covered myself to the rest of his family
when they should have been prepared for
my approach but i did not believe my
errors to be irretrievable and after much
consideration i resolved to return to the
cottage seek the old man and by my rep-
resentations win him to my party

  these thoughts calmed me and in the
afternoon i sank into a profound sleep
but the fever of my blood did not allow
me to be visited by peaceful dreams the
horrible scene of the preceding day was
for ever acting before my eyes the fe-
males were flying and the enraged felix
tearing me from his fathers feet i awoke
exhausted and finding that it was already
night i crept forth from my hiding-place
and went in search of food

  when my hunger was appeased i di-
rected my steps towards the well-known
path that conducted to the cottage all
there was at peace i crept into my hovel
and remained in silent expectation of the
accustomed hour when the family arose
that hour passed the sun mounted high
in the heavens but the cottagers did not
appear i trembled violently apprehend-
ing some dreadful misfortune the inside
of the cottage was dark and i heard no
motion i can not describe the agony of
this suspense


weird tales

  presently two countrymen passed by
but pausing near the cottage they entered
into conversation using violent gesticula-
tions but i did not understand what they
said as they spoke the language of the
country which differed from that of my
protectors soon after however felix ap-
proached with another man i was sur-
prized as i knew that he had not quitted
the cottage that morning and waited
anxiously to discover from his discourse
the meaning of these unusual appearances

   do you consider said his compan-
ion to him that you will be obliged to
pay three months rent and to lose the
produce of your garden i do not wish to
take any unfair advantage and i beg
therefore that you will take some days to
consider of your determination

   it is utterly useless replied felix
we can never again inhabit your cottage
the life of my father is in the greatest
danger owing to the dreadful circum-
stance that i have related my wife and
my sister will never recover from their
horror i entreat you not to reason with
me any more take possession of your
tenement and let me fly from this place
felix trembled violently as he said
this he and his companion entered the
cottage in which they remained for a few
minutes and then departed i never saw
any of the family of de lacey more

t continued for the remainder of the
a day in my hovel in a state of utter
and stupid despair my protectors had
departed and had broken the only link
that held me to the world for the first
time the feelings of revenge and hatred
filled my bosom and i did not strive to
control them but allowing myself to be
borne away by the stream i bent my mind
towards injury and death when i
thought of my friends of the mild voice
of de lacey the gentle eyes of agatha

and the exquisite beauty of the arabian
these thoughts vanished and a gush of
tears somewhat soothed me but again
when i reflected that they had spurned
and deserted me anger returned a rage
of anger and unable to injure anything
human i turned my fury towards inan-
imate objects as night advanced i
placed a variety of combustibles around
the cottage and after having destroyed
every vestige of cultivation in the garden
i waited with forced impatience until the
moon had sunk to commence my opera-
tions

  as the night advanced a fierce wind
arose from the woods and quickly dis-
persed the clouds that had loitered in the
heavens the blast tore along like a mighty
avalanche and produced a kind of insan-
ity in my spirits that burst all bounds of
reason and reflection i lighted the dry
branch of a tree and danced with fury
around the devoted cottage my eyes still
fixed on the western horizon the edge of
which the moon nearly touched apaft
of its orb was at length hidrand fwaved
my brand it sunk and with a loud
scream i fired the straw and heath and
bushes which i had collected the wind
fanned the fire and the cottage was quick-
ly enveloped by the flames which dung
to it and licked it with their forked and
destroying tongues

  as soon as i was convinced that no
assistance could save any part of the hab-
itation i quitted the scene and sought for
refuge in the woods

  and now with the world before me
whither should i bend my steps i re-
solved to fly far from the scene of my mis-
fortunes but to me hated and despised
every country must be equally horrible
at length the thought of you crossed my
mind i learned from your papers that
you were my father my creator and to
whom could i apply with more fitness

                    w t-
frankenstein



than to him who had given me life
among the lessons that felix had be-
stowed upon safie geography had not
been omitted i had learned from these
the relative situations of the different
countries of the earth you had men-
tioned geneva as the name of your native
town and towards this place i resolved
to proceed

  but how was i to direct myself i
knew that i must travel in a southwest-
erly direction to reach my destination but
the sun was my only guide i did not
know the names of the towns that i was
to pass through nor could i ask informa-
tion from a single human being but i did
not despair from you only could i hope
for succor although towards you i felt no
sentiment but that of hatred unfeeling
heardess creator you had endowed me
with perceptions and passions and then
cast me abroad an object for the scorn and
horror of mankind but on you only had
i any claim for pity and redress and from
you i determined to seek that justice which
i vainly attempted to gain from any other
being that wore the human form

y travels were long and the suf-
ferings i endured intense it was
late in autumn when i quitted the district
where i had so long resided i traveled
only at night fearful of encountering the
visage of a human being nature decayed
around me and the sun became heatless
rain and snow poured around me mighty
rivers were frozen the surface of the earth
was hard and chill and bare and i found
no shelter oh earth how often did i
imprecate curses on the cause of my being
the mildness of my nature had fled and
all within me was turned to gall and bit-
terness the nearer i approached to your
habitation the more deeply did i feel the
spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart

  snow fell and the waters were hard-
     w t-fl

ened but i rested not a few incidents
now and then directed me and i possessed
a map of the country but i often wan-
dered wide from my path the agony
of my feelings allowed me no respite no
incident occurred from which my rage
and misery could not extract its food but
a circumstance that happened when i ar-
rived on the confines of switzerland when
the sun had recovered its warmth and the
earth again began to look green confirmed
in an especial manner the bitterness and
horror of my feelings

  i generally rested during the day and
traveled only when i was secured by night
from the view of man one morning
however finding that my path lay through
a deep wood i ventured to continue my
journey after the sun had risen the day
which was one of the first of spring
cheered even me by the loveliness of its
sunshine and the balminess of the air i
felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure
that had long appeared dead revive with-
in me half surprized by the novelty of
these sensations i allowed myself to be
borne away by them and forgetting my
solitude and deformity dared to be happy
soft tears again bedewed my cheeks and
i even raised my humid eyes with thank-
fulness towards the blessed sun which
bestowed such joy upon me

  i continued to wind among the paths
of the wood until i came to its boundary
which was skirted by a deep and rapid
river into which many of the trees bent
their branches now budding with the
fresh spring here i paused not exactly
knowing what path to pursue when i
heard the sound of voices that induced me
to conceal myself under the shade of a
cypress i was scarcely hid when a young
girl came running towards the spot where
i was concealed laughing as if she ran
from some one in sport she continued
her course along the precipitous sides of


weird tales

the river when suddenly her foot slipt
and she fell into the rapid stream

  i rushed from my hiding-place and
with extreme labor from the force of the
current saved her and dragged her to
shore she was senseless and i endeav-
ored by every means in my power to re-
store animation when i was suddenly in-
terrupted by the approach of a rustic who
was probably the person from whom she
had playfully fled on seeing me he
darted towards me and tearing the girl
from my arms hastened towards the deep-
er parts of the wood i followed speed-
ily i hardly knew why but when the man
saw me draw near he aimed a gun which
he carried at my body and fired i sunk
to the ground and my injurer with in-
creased swiftness escaped into the wood

  this was then the reward of my be-
nevolence i had saved a human being
from destruction and as a recompense i
now writhed under the miserable pain of
a wound which shattered the flesh and
bone the feelings of kindness and
gentleness which i had entertained but a
few moments before gave place to hellish
rage and gnashing of teeth inflamed by
pain i vowed eternal hatred and ven-
geance to all mankind but the agony of
my wound overcame me my pulses
paused and i fainted

ttor some weeks i led a miserable life
t in the woods endeavoring to cure the
wound which i had received the ball
had entered my shoulder and i knew not
whether it had remained there or passed
through at any rate i had no means of ex-
tracting it my sufferings were augment-
ed also by the oppressive sense of the
injustice and ingratitude of their infliction
my daily vows rose for revenge-a deep
and deadly revenge such as would alone
compensate for the outrages and anguish
i had endured

  after some weeks my wound healed
and i continued my journey the labors
i endured were no longer to be alleviated
by the bright sun or gentle breezes of
spring all joy was but a mockery which
insulted my desolate state and made me
feel more painfully that i was not made
for the enjoyment of pleasure

  but my toils now drew near a close
and in two months from this time i
reached the environs of geneva

  it was evening when i arrivedand i
retired to a hiding-place among the fields
that surround it to meditate in what man-
ner i should apply to you i was op-
pressed by fatigue and hunger and far too
unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of
evening or the prospect of the sun setting
behind the stupendous mountains of jura

  at this time a slight sleep relieved me
from the pain of reflection which was dis-
turbed by the approach of a beautiful
child who came running into the recess i
had chosen with all the sportiveness of
infancy suddenly as i gazed on him an
idea seized me that this little creature was
unprejudiced and had lived too short a
time to have imbibed a horror of deform-
ity if therefore i could seize him and
educate him as my companion and friend
i should not be so desolate in this peopled
earth

  urged by this impulse i seized on the
boy as he passed and drew him towards
me as soon as he beheld my form he
placed his hands before his eyes and
uttered a shrill scream i drew his hand
forcibly from his face and said child
what is the meaning of this i do not
intend to hurt you listen to me

  he struggled violently let me go
he cried monster ugly wretch you wish
to eat me and tear me to pieces-you are
an ogre-let me go or i will tell my
papa
frankenstein



   boy you will never see your father
again you must come with me

   hideous monster let me go my
papa is a syndic-he is monsieur frank-
enstein-he will punish you you dare
not keep me

   frankenstein you belong then to my
enemy-to him towards whom i have
sworn eternal revenge you shall be my
first victim

  the child still struggled and loaded
me with epithets which carried despair to
my heart i grasped his throat to silence
him and in a moment he lay dead at my
feet

  i gazed on my victim and my heart
swelled with exultation and hellish tri-
umph clapping my hands i exclaimed i
too can create desolation my enemy is
not invulnerable this death will carry
despair to him and a thousand other mis-
eries shall torment and destroy him

  as i fixed my eyes on the child i saw
something glittering on his breast i took
it it was a portrait of a most lovely
woman in spite of my malignity it soft-
ened and attracted me for a few mo-
ments i gazed with delight on her dark
eyes fringed by deep lashes and her
lovely lips but presently my rage re-
turned  i remembered that i was for ever
deprived of the delights that such beauti-
ful creatures could bestow and that she
whose resemblance i contemplated would
in regarding me have changed that air
of divine benignity to one expressive of
disgust and affright

  can you wonder that such thoughts
transported me with rage i only wonder
that at that moment instead of venting
my sensations in exclamations and agony
i did not rush among mankind and perish
in the attempt to destroy them

  while i was overcome by these feel-
ings i left the spot where i had commit-

ted the murder and seeking a more
secluded hiding-place i entered a bam
which had appeared to me to be empty
a woman was sleeping on some straw
she was young not indeed so beautiful
as her whose portrait i held but of an
agreeable aspect and blooming in the
loveliness of youth and health here i
thought is one of those whose joy-impart-
ing smiles are bestowed on all but me
and then i bent over her and whispered
awake fairest thy lover is near - he
who would give his life but to obtain one
look of affection from thine eyes my be-
loved awake

  the sleeper stirred a thrill of terror
ran through me should she indeed
awake and see me and curse me and
denounce the murderer thus would she
assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened
and she beheld me the thought was
madness it stirred the fiend within me-
not i but she shall suffer the murder i
have committed because i am for ever
robbed of all that she could give me she
shall atone the crime had its source in
her be hers the punishment thanks to
the lessons of felix and the sanguinary
laws of man i had learned how to work
mischief i bent over her and placed the
portrait securely in one of the folds of her
dress she moved again and i fled

  for some days i haunted the spot
where these scenes had taken place some-
times wishing to see you sometimes re-
solved to quit the world and its miseries
for ever at length i wandered towards
these mountains and have ranged through
their immense recesses consumed by a
burning passion which you alone can
gratify we may not part until you have
promised to comply with my requisition
i am alone and miserable man will not
associate with me but one as deformed
and horrible as myself would not deny
herself to me my companion must be of

the being finished speaking and fixed
his looks upon me in expectation of
a reply but i was bewildered perplexed
and unable to arrange my ideas sufficient-
ly to understand the full extent of his

proposition he continued-

  you must create a female for me with
whom i can live in the interchange of
those sympathies necessary for my being
this you alone can do and i demand it
of you as a right which you must not re-
fuse to concede

   the latter part of his tale had kindled
anew in me the anger that had died away
while he narrated his peaceful life among
the cottagers and as he said this i could
no longer suppress the rage that burned
within me

   i do refuse it i replied and no tor-
ture shall ever extort a consent from me
you may render me the most miserable of
men but you shall never make me base
in my own eyes shall i create another
like yourself whose joint wickedness
might desolate the world begone i
have answered ypu you may torture me
but i will never consent

  you are in the wrong replied the
fiend and instead of threatening i am
content to reason with you i am mali-
cious because i am miserable am i not
shunned and hated by all mankind you
my creator would tear me to pieces and
triumph remember that and tell me why
i should pity man more than he pities me
you would not call it murder if you could
precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts
and destroy my frame the work of your
own hands shall i respect man when he
contemns me let him live with me in
the interchange of kindness and instead

of injury i would bestow every benefit
upon him with tears of gratitude at his
acceptance but that can not be the hu-
man senses are insurmountable barriers
to our union yet mine shall not be the
submission of abject slavery i will re-
venge my injuries if i can not inspire
love i will cause fear and chiefly towards
you my arch-enemy because my creator
do i swear inextinguishable hatred have
a care i will work at your destruction
nor finish until i desolate your heart so
that you shall curse the hour of your
birth

   a fiendish rage animated him as he said
this his face was wrinkled into contor-
tions too horrible for human eyes to be-
hold but presently he calmed himself
and proceeded-

  i intended to reason this passion is
detrimental to me for you do not reflect
that you are the cause of its excess if any
being felt emotions of benevolence
towards me i should return them an hun-
dred and an hundred fold for that one
creatures sake i would make peace with
the whole kind but i now indulge in
dreams of bliss that can not be realized
what i ask of you is reasonable and mod-
erate i demand a creature of another sex
but as hideous as myself the gratification
is small but it is all that i can receive and
it shall content me it is true we shall
be monsters cut off from all the world
but on that account we shall be more at-
tached to one another our lives will not
be happy but they will be harmless and
free from the misery i now feel oh my
creator make me happy let me feel grat-
itude towards you for one benefit let
me see that i excite the sympathy of some
existing thing do not deny me my re-
quest

  i was moved i shuddered when i
thought of the possible consequences of
my consent but i felt that there was some
frankenstein



justice in his argument his tale and the
feelings he now expressed proved him to
be a creature of fine sensations and did
i not as his maker owe him all the portions
of happiness that it was in my power to
bestow he saw my change of feeling
and continued-

  if you consent neither you nor any
other human being shall ever see us again
i will go to the vast wilds of south amer-
ica my food is not that of man i do not
destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my
appetite acorns and berries afford me suf-
ficient nourishment my companion will
be of the same nature as myself and will
be content with the same fare we shall
make our bed of dried leaves the sun will
shine on us as on man and will ripen
our food the picture i present to you
is peaceful and human and you must feel
that you could deny it only in the wanton-
ness of power and cruelty pitiless as you
have been towards me i now see compas-
sion in your eyes let me seize the favor-
able moment and persuade you to promise
what i so ardently desire

  you propose replied i to fly from
the habitations of man to dwell in those
wilds where the beasts of the field will be
your only companions how can you
who long for the love and sympathy of
man persevere in this exile you will
return and again seek their kindness and
you will meet with their detestation your
evil passions will be renewed and you
will then have a companion to aid you in
the task of destruction this may not be
cease to argue the point for i can not
consent

  how inconstant are your feelings but
a moment ago you were moved by my rep-
resentations and why do you again hard-
en yourself to my complaints i swear to
you by the earth which i inhabit and by
you that made me that with the compan-
ion you bestow i will quit the neighbor-

hood of man and dwell as it may chance
in the most savage of places my evil
passions will have fled for i shall meet
with sympathy my life will flow quietly
away and in my dying moments i shall
not curse my maker

his words had a strange effect upon
me i compassionated him and
sometimes felt a wish to console him but
when i looked upon him when i saw the
filthy mass that moved and talked my
heart sickened and my feelings were al-
tered to those of horrr and hatred i
tried to stifle these sensations i thought
that as i could not sympathize with him
i had no right to withhold from him the
small portion of happiness which was yet
in my power to bestow

  you swear i said to be harmless
but have you not already shown a degree
of malice that should reasonably make me
distrust you may not even this be a
feint that will increase your triumph by
affording a wider scope for your revenge
how is this i must not be trifled
with and i demand an answer if i have
no ties and no affections hatred and vice
must be my portion the love of another
will destroy the cause of my crimes and i
shall become a thing of whose existence
every one will be ignorant my vices are
the children of a forced solitude that i
abhor and my virtues will necessarily arise
when i live in communion with an equal
i shall feel the affections of a sensitive be-
ing and become linked to the chain of
existence and events from which i am
now excluded

  i paused some time to reflect on all he
had related and the various arguments
which he had employed i thought of the
promise of virtues which he had displayed
on the opening of his existence and the
subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by
the loathing and scorn which his protec-


weird tales

tors had manifested towards him his
power and threats were not omitted in my
calculations a creature who could exist in
the ice-caves of the glaciers and hide
himself from pursuit among the ridges of
inaccessible precipices was a being pos-
ssessing faculties it would be vain to cope
with after a long pause of reflection i
concluded that the justice due both to him
and my fellow-creatures demanded of me
that i should comply with his request

turning to him therefore i said-

  i consent to your demand on your sol-
emn oath to quit europe for ever and
every other place in the neighborhood of
man as soon as i shall deliver into your
hands a female who will accompany you
in your exile

  i swear he cried by the sun and
by the blue sky of heaven and by the fire
of love that burns my heart that if you
grant my prayer while they exist you
shall never behold me again depart to
your home and commence your labors
i shall watch their progress with unutter-
able anxiety and fear not but that when
you are ready i shall appear

  saying this he suddenly quitted me
fearful perhaps of any change in my sen-
timents i saw him descend the mountain
with greater speed than the flight of an
eagle and quickly lost among the undu-
lations of the sea of ice

  his tale had occupied the whole day
and the sun was upon the verge of the
horizon when he departed i knew that
i ought to hasten my descent towards the
valley as i should soon be encompassed
in darkness but my heart was heavy and
my steps slow the labor of winding
among the little paths of the mountains
and fixing my feet firmly as i advanced
perplexed me occupied as i was by the
emotions which the day had produced
night was far advanced when i came
to the half-way resting-place and seated

myself beside the fountain the stars
shone at intervals as the clouds passed
from over them the dark pines rose be-
fore me and every here and there a bro-
ken tree lay on the ground it was a scene
of wonderful solemnity and stirred
strange thoughts within me i wept bit-
terly and clasping my hands in agony i
exdaimed oh stars and douds and
winds ye are all about to mock me if ye
really pity me crush sensation and mem-
ory let me become as nought but if not
depart depart and leave me in darkness

  these were wild and miserable
thoughts but i can not describe to you
how the eternal twinkling of the stars
weighed upon me and how i listened to
every bias of wind as if it were a dull
ugly siroc on its way to consume me

  morning dawned before i arrived at the
village of chamounix i took no rest but
returned immediately to geneva even
in my own heart i could give no expres-
sion to my sensations-they weighed oa
me with a mountains weight and their
excess destroyed my agony beneath them
thus i returned home and entering the
house presented myself to the family

  my haggard and wild appearance awoke
intense alarm but i answered no ques-
tion scarcely did i speak i felt as if i
were placed under a ban-as if i had no
right to claim their sympathies-as if
never more might i enjoy companionship
with them yet even thus i loved them
to adoration and to save them i resolved
to dedicate myself to my most abhorred
task the prospect of such an occupatioa
made every other circumstance of exist-
ence pass before me like a dream and that
thought only had to me the reality of life

chapter is

day after day week after week passed
away on my return to geneva and
i could not collect the courage to recoal-
frankenstein



mence my work i feared the vengeance
of the disappointed fiend yet i was unable
to overcome my repugnance to the task
which was enjoined me i found that i
could not compose a female without again
devoting several months to profound study
and laborious disquisition i had heard of
some discoveries having been made by an
english philosopher the knowledge of
which was material to my success and i
sometimes thought of obtaining my fa-
thers consent to visit england for this
purpose but i clung to every pretense of
delay and shrunk from taking the first
step in an undertaking whose immediate
necessity began to appear less absolute to
me

  a change indeed had taken place in
me my health which had hitherto de-
clined was now much restored and my
spirits when unchecked by the memory
of my unhappy promise rose proportion-
ably my father saw this change with
pleasure and he turned- his thoughts
towards the best method of eradicating
the remains of my melancholy which
every now and then would return by fits
and with a devouring blackness overcast
the approaching sunshine

  at these moments i took refuge in the
most perfect solitude i passed whole
days on the lake alone in a little boat
watching the clouds and listening to the
rippling of the waves silent and listless
but the fresh air and bright sun seldom
failed to restore me to some degree of
composure and on my return i met the
salutations of my friends with a readier
smile and a more cheerful heart

  it was after my return from one of these
rambles that my father calling me aside
thus addressed me

  i am happy to remark my dear son
that you have resumed your former pleas-
ures and seem to be returning to yourself
and yet you are still unhappy and still

avoid our society for some time i was
lost in conjecture as to the cause of this
but yesterday an idea struck me and if it
is well founded i conjure you to avow it
reserve  such a point would be not
only useless but draw down treble misery
on us all

  i trembled violently at his exordium
and my father continued-

  i confess my son that i have always
looked forward to your marriage with our
dear elizabeth as the tie of our domestic
comfort and the stay of my declining
years you were attached to each other
from your earliest infancy you studied
together and appeared in dispositions
and tastes entirely suited to one another
but so blind is the experience of man that
what i conceived to be the best assistants
to my plan may have entirely destroyed
it you perhaps regard her as your sis-
ter without any wish that she might be-
come your wife nay you may have met
with another whom you may love and
considering yourself as bound in honor to
elizabeth this struggle may occasion the
poignant misery which you appear to
feel

  my dear father reassure yourself i
love my cousin tenderly and sincerely i
never saw any woman who excited as
elizabeth does my warmest admiration
and affection my future hopes and pros-
pects are entirely bound up in the expec-
tation of our union

  the expression of your sentiments of
this subject my dear victor gives me
more pleasure than i have for some time
experienced if you feel thus we shall
assuredly be happy however present
events may cast a gloom over us but
it is this gloom which appears to have
taken so strong a hold of your mind that
i wish to dissipate tell me therefore
whether you object to an immediate sol-
emnization of the marriage we have


weird tales

been unfortunate and recent events have
drawn us from that everyday tranquillity
befitting my years and infirmities you
are younger yet i do not suppose pos-
sessed as you are of a competent fortune
that an early marriage would at all inter-
fere with any future plans of honor and
utility that you may have formed do not
suppose however that i wish to dictate
happiness to you or that a delay on your
part would cause me any serious uneasi-
ness interpret my words with candor
and answer me i conjure you with con-
fidence and sincerity

   i listened to my father in silence and
remained for some time incapable of of-
fering any reply i revolved rapidly in
my mind a multitude of thoughts and en-
deavored to arrive at some conclusion
alas to me the idea of an immediate union
with my elizabeth was one of horror and
dismay i was bound by a solemn prom-
ise which i had not yet fulfilled and
dared not break or if i did what man-
ifold miseries might not impend over me
and my devoted family could i enter
into a festival with this deadly weight yet
hanging round my neck and bowing me
to the ground i must perform my en-
gagement and let the monster depart with
his mate before i allowed myself to enjoy
the delight of an union from which i ex-
pected peace

  i remembered also the necessity im-
posed upon me of either journeying to
england or entering into a long corre-
spondence with those philosophers of that
country whose knowledge and discover-
ies were of indispensable use to me in my
present undertaking the latter method
of obtaining the desired intelligence was
dilatory and unsatisfactory besides i had
an insurmountable aversion to the idea of
engaging myself in my loathsome task in
my fathers house while in habits of fa-
miliar intercourse with those i loved i

knew that a thousand fearful accidents
might occur the slightest of which would
disclose a tale to thrill all connected with
me with horror i was aware also that i
should often lose all self-command all
capacity of hiding the harrowing sensa-
tions that would possess me during the
progress of my unearthly occupation i
must absent myself from all i loved while
thus employed once commenced it
would quickly be achieved and i might
be restored to my family in peace and
happiness my promise fulfilled the
monster would depart for ever or so
my fond fancy imaged some accident
might meanwhile occur to destroy him
and put an end to my slavery for ever

  these feelings dictated my answer to
my father i expressed a wish to visit
england but concealing the true reasons
of this request i clothed my desires under
a guise which excited no suspicion while
i urged my desire with an earnestness that
easily induced my father to comply after
so long a period of an absorbing melan-
choly that resembled madness in its in-
tensity and effects he was glad to find
that i was capable of taking pleasure in
the idea of such a journey and he hoped
that change of scene and varied amuse-
ment would before my return have re-
stored me entirely to myself

  the duration of my absence was left
to my own choice a few months or at
most a year was the period contemplated
one paternal kind precaution he had taken
to ensure my having a companion with-
out previously communicating with me he
had in concert with elizabeth arranged
that clerval should join me at strasburgh
this interfered with the solitude i coveted
for the prosecution of my task yet at the
commencement of my journey the pres-
ence of my friend could in no way be ts
impediment and truly i rejoiced that tins
i should be saved many hours of locelg
frankenstein



maddening reflection nay henty might
stand between me and the intrusion of
my foe if i were alone would he not at
times force his abhorred presence on me
to remind me of my task or to contem-
plate its progress

  to england therefore i was bound
and it was understood that my union with
elizabeth should take place immediately
on my return my fathers age rendered
him extremely averse to delay for my-
self there was one reward i promised
myself from my detested toils-one con-
solation for my unparalleled sufferings it
was he prospect of that day when en-
franchized from my miserable slavery i
might claim elizabeth and forget the
past in my union with her

  i now made arrangements for my jour-
ney but one feeling haunted me which
filled me with fear and agitation during
my absence i should leave my friends un-
conscious of the existence of their enemy
and unprotected from his attacks exas-
perated as he might be by my departure
but he had promised to follow me wher-
ever i might go and would he not accom-
pany me to england this imagination
was dreadful in itself but soothing inas-
much as it supposed the safety of my
friends i was agonized with the idea of
the possibility that the reverse of this
might happen but through the whole
period during which i was slave of my
creature i allowed myself to be governed
by the impulses of the moment and my
present sensations strongly intimated
that the fiend would follow me and ex-
empt my family from the danger of his
machinations

it was in the latter end of september
that i again quitted my native country
my journey had been my own suggestion
and elizabeth therefore acquiesced but
she was filled with disquiet at the idea of

my suffering away from her the inroads
of misery and grief it had been her
care which provided me a companion in
clerval - and yet a man is blind to a
thousand minute circumstances which call
forth a womans sedulous attention she
longed to bid me hasten my return-a
thousand conflicting emotions rendered
her mute as she bade me a tearful silent
farewell

  i threw myself into the carriage that
was to convey me away hardly knowing
whither i was going and careless of what
was passing around i remembered only
and it was with a bitter anguish that i re-
flected on it to order that my chemical in-
struments should be packed to go with me
filled with dreary imaginations i passed
through many beautiful and majestic
scenes but my eyes were fixed and unob-
serving i could only think of the bourne
of my travels and the work which was to
occupy me whilst they endured

  after some days spent in listless indo-
lence during which i traversed many
leagues i arrived at strasburgh where i
waited two days for clerval he came
alas how great was the contrast between
us he was alive to every new scene
joyful when he saw the beauties of the
setting sun and more happy when he
beheld it rise and recommence a new day

  he pointed out to me the shifting col-
ors of the landscape and the appearances
of the sky this is what it is to live
he cried now i enjoy existence but
you my dear frankenstein wherefore are
you desponding and sorrowful

  in truth i was occupied by gloomy
thoughts and neither saw the descent of
the evening star nor the golden sunrise
reflected in the rhine and you my
friend would be far more amused with
the journal of clerval who observed the
scenery with an eye of feeling and delight

since we announced that we would not reprint dracula the readers of this mag-
azine who dislike serial reprints have centered their attacks upon franken-
stein we asked you remember whether you would like us to reprint some of
the lesser known weird novels after frankenstein is completed as it will be in our
december issue so far those of you who do not want us to use any serial reprints
are in a majority as shown by your letters

     there seems to be a considerable diversity of opinion as to what your policy
toward reprints should be writes paul s smith of orange new jersey but there
is one fact that no one can deny-namely that the back numbers of weird tales
constitute a veritable treasure house of fine weird stories and i am sure that an over-
whelming majority of the readers would like to have the best of these stories reprinted
from time to time when you reprint a story that is not from an old issue of your
magazine there is very often the probability that most of your readers are familiar
with it because so many lovers of weird fiction have been reading this type of litera-
ture for years furthermore most of these well-known weird stories by noted writ-
ers of the past are easily obtained from public libraries many readers no doubt have
some of them in their own book collections these facts constitute a strong argu-
ment against reprinting well-known weird stories if the stories are not well known
the case is different but such stories though always welcome are not always easy
to find

    how about some goo spooky ghost stories and some witchcraft and black
magic tales queries mrs c g mcdowell of santa monica california the
serial by seabury quinn is splendid-please give us more and more about jules de
grandin also more creepy poetry with a swing like all hallows een and madmans
song-and shorts like maurice levels night and silence

     lion penhall rees of toronto writes to the eyrie why have serials the
atmosphere of horror and weirdness can not be recaptured after a month elapses in-
stead of publishing long stories always available in book form why not give us
lists-author title publisher price with a brief synopsis then we could buy these
books if we wished it seems to be your fashion to pretend that no one can hope
to equal poe and very few can expect to compete with lovecraft giving full credit
to both these fine writers i claim that every issue contains at least one story as good
as their best and often much better these two men seem to be your idols and you

     jack darrow of chicago writes to the eyrie if you continue reprint serials
please use only those stories that are out of print and those not available in the eng-
lish language the devils bride rose to a smashing conclusion in the great july issue
of weird tales the african scene is the best in the entire story i hope that the
story will be put in book form and in the films the phantom hand by victor rous-
seau promises to be even better than the devils bride if the first installment is a
sample of what is to come the story starts right off without a whole lot of intro-
duction welcome back mr rousseau

    writes thomas de v harper from marshfield oregon just to introduce my-
self would say that i have not missed a copy of weird tales since the very first
issue i want to register my vote against serial reprints my choice of the reprint
department would be one complete story each month taken from one of the old
issues of weird tales stories such as dracula frankenstein the wolf-leader
and the like are available to those that want them while most of the outstanding sto-
ries which have been published in weird tales are not available anywhere else i
agree with guy detrick in the july eyrie that the fyle of writing of these older
authors is decidedly tiresome to present-day readers frankenstein may have been a
wonderful novel in its day but it is to me one of the most tiresome things i have
ever tried to read you might have turned that over to seabury quinn and had him
write it up to date and you would have had something worth while seabury quinn
is the best writer on your staff but-i made the suggestion once before-i would
like to see de grandin fail once actually miss altogether and have trowbridge
bring the case to a successful conclusion i would like to see what de grandin would
say to that and for petes sake dont adopt the trick of putting a group of silly
questions at the end of your serials as you did this month at the end of the phan-
tom hand end your serials with a simple dignified to be continued and let it
go at that i dont have much use for serials anyway and for my part would rather
there werent any in the magazine at all i want to see some more stories of the inter-
stellar patrol by edmond hamilton some readers apparently do not like these
but i think they are the best interplanetary stories i have read they were action sto-
ries and not burdened with alleged scientific descriptions of various sorts of ma-
chinery-they were written in a manner that implied that we knew all that stuff
and got on to the action of the plot i like em and hope there will be some more
i want to thank you for the many pleasant hours the magazine has brought me and
to assure you that i hope to continue to read it for a long time to come

    a letter from thomas c marks of jackson tennessee says i have just com-
pleted quinns novel the devils bride and think it by far the most marvelous story
ever published in your magazine from beginning to end it held my attention as
no other story has ever done i have been a regular reader of weird tales since
april  in fact i still have that issue and am saving it for lovecrafts poem

it is hard to convey the full awfulness of that scene in the first place the room
was not dark it was alight with an unearthly greenish glow which emanated
from the uncouth shape before me no hue of heaven or hell was ever like that
oily viscous mass of writhing vapor dangling half-way between floor and ceiling
above vernons chair no living thing born of woman was ever even remotely like
that hideous abhorrence no stench from the foulest slaughter-house ever approached
that vile reek of living death and embryonic putrescence

    the thing had no certain outlines no definite form it possessed no single
human characteristic-arms legs or face it was a thousand times more horrible
than any twisted mockery of human life it was like a monstrous malformed devil-
fish with bloated swollen tentacles and from the very center of its loathsome mass
came the sound of its breathing

    breathing i call it god that sound like a gigantic slug the thing envel-
oped vernons chair-and it was eating i could hear the sucking of its unseen maw

i	could hear its shapeless lips-if it had lips-drooling blood and tearing flesh i
could hear the bones snapping splintering grinding

     and then i saw   

     what it was that doctor moller saw in that horrific instant when physical dark-
ness rolled like a thick fog and wrapped an entire community in its folds makes a
blood-freezing tale of gripping interest and fascination it will be printed complete

nemesis for nine years weird tales has been growing better and better that is
something that few magazines can boast

    writes mrs m r mccrorey of glendale california i would like very mudi
to see some stories about witches and wizards in weird tales couldnt you give
us a story about the witches of olden days with their spells and familiars
weird tales has from time to time published such stories in the past and will
continue to do so in the future noteworthy among those we have already published
were the series of witchcraft stories by seabury quinn and paul ernsts story a
witchs curse-the editors

    i am not a reader of long standing writes fred c miles of new provi-
dence new jersey but i must cast my vote in the dracula reprint discussion like
most of your other readers i know this book almost by heart therefore i am indeed
joyful to see your announcement in the july issue that you have decided to forego
its reprinting the little fantastic verses which appear in the magazine are excep-
tionally good the little gods wait in particular was well written guess ill
look through the coming next month announcement ah whats this a story by
clark ashton smith the maker of gargoyles-boy that sounds interesting ah
well what has mr smith written that isnt interesting he undoubtedly well in
my opinion anyway is your best author seabury quinn is excellent but smith is
super-excellent i am thrilled indeed to see notice of a coming novel by otis adel-
bert kline may his stories never cease to appear clark ashton smith seabury
quinn and otis a kline are a triumvirate who never fail to please

     readers we shall be glad if you will let us know what are your favorite stories
in this issue the concluding installment of seabury quinns novel of devil-wor-
ship the devils bride won first place in the july issue with robert e howards

than in listening to my reflections i a
miserable wretch haunted by a curse that
shut up every avenue to enjoyment

  we had agreed to descend the rhine
in a boat from strasburgh to rotterdam
whence we might take shipping for lon-
don during this voyage we passed
many willowy islands and saw several
beautiful towns we stayed a day at
mannheim-and on the fifth from our
departure from strasburgh arrived at ma-
yence the course of the rhine below
mayence becomes much more pictur-
esque the river descends rapidly and
winds between hills not high but steep
and of beautiful forms this part of the
rhine indeed presents a singularly varie-
gated landscape in one spot you view
rugged hills ruined castles overlooking
tremendous precipices with the dark rhine
rushing beneath and on the sudden turn
of a promontory flourishing vineyards
with green sloping banks and a mean-
dering river and populous towns occupy
the scene

  we traveled at the time of the vintage
and heard the song of the laborers as we
glided down the stream even i de-
pressed in mind and my spirits contin-
ually agitated by gloomy feelings even i
was pleased i lay at die bottom of the
boat and as i gazed on the cloudless blue
sky i seemed to drink in a tranquillity to
which i had long been a stranger and if
these were my sensations who can de-

   i have seen he said the most beau-
tiful scenes of my own country i have
visited the lakes of lucerne and uri
where the snowy mountains descend al-
most perpendicularly to the water casting
black and impenetrable shades which
would cause a gloomy and mournful ap-
pearance were it not for the most verdant
islands that relieve the eye by their gay
appearance i have seen this lake agitated
by a tempest when the wind tore up
whirlwinds of water and gave you an
idea of what the waterspout must be on
the great ocean and the waves dash with
fury the base of the mountain where the
priest and his mistress were overwhelmed
by an avalanche and where their dying
voices are still said to be heard amid the
pauses of the nightly wind i have seen
the mountains of la valais and the pays
de vaud but this country victor pleases
me more than all those wonders

  beyond cologne we descended to the
plains of holland and we resolved to post
the remainder of our way for the wind
was contrary and the stream of the river
was too gentle to aid us

   our journey here lost the interest aris-
ing from beautiful scenery but we arrived
in a few days at rotterdam whence we
proceeded by sea to england it was on
a clear morning in the latter days of de-
cember that i first saw the white cliffs of
britain the banks of the thames pre-
sented a new scene they were flat but
fertile and almost every town was marked
by the remembrance of some story we
saw tilbury fort and remembered the
spanish armada gravesend woolwich
and greenwich places which i had heard
of even in my country

  at length we saw the numerous stee-
ples of london st pauls towering above
all and the tower famed in english

dragomans
confession

by

otis adelbert kline

hen lo foo danced

never before had i seen her so beautiful so radiant or so madly alluring the key
color of the ensemble she had chosen for that dance was red the color of love her
skirt was a tenuous diaphanous material of a shade that matched the red of her lips and was
suspended on a girdle of cloth of gold studded with rubies her breast shields were blood-
ied coral beads woven on golden threads and her anklets and armlets were gold decked with
figures of red lacquer

    the dance was one of passionate love--of wooing and of mating never had she danced
thus before me and never had i been so powerfully affected the throbbing music the
rhythmic swaying of her slim young body and the matchless perfection of her face and figure
held me enthralled

     suddenly i realized that the dance was over the music had ceased and the little dancer
had flung herself down before me i caught her up and she nestled in my arms like a tired
child but her eyes were the eyes of a woman and they were starry with a light which a man
though he see it but once may never mistake the fragrance of her breath intoxicated me like
heady wine unmindful of the slave-girls and the eunuch i claimed the sweetness of her lips
her arms stole about my neck and clung still holding her in my arms i stood up and
carrying her into our room gently lowered her to the diivan

    behind me musa the eunuch closed the door   

    here is a fascinating story that takes you into the harem of an oriental potentate you
can always be sure of thrilling and glamorous entertainment from the inspired pen of mr
kline this action-adventure novelette of hamed the dragoman and his love for a beautiful
chinese princess is printed complete in the current issue of oriental stories you can
