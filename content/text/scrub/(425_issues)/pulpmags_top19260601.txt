good reading

by

charles houston

  we novelists are the showmen of
life said a famous english writer
once putting in other words shake-
speares comment on holding the mirror
up to nature and to be sure it is the
writing people who show us how thrill-
ing a thing life can be they can come
with their little words on paper into
our commonplace surroundings and
change drab existence into glorious ad-
venture they can take us away with
them on desperate affairs send us to
face the most overwhelming odds give
us romance within book covers that
transforms all our workaday world

  it is sheer nonsense to say that we
americans are not romantic that we
spend all our time in pursuit of the
almighty dollar as a matter of fact
we are the most romantic of all peo-
ples on the face of the earth to-day
compared with us most europeans are
a skeptical cold materialistic breed it
may be because we are younger than
europe because it is still possible for
us to cherish the illusions of youth

  whatever the cause it is true that we
sit at the feet of our story-tellers and
listen to their romancing just as little
children gather round some beloved
maker of magic

  this is nothing to be ashamed of
we have our achievements in the world
of material things we are unsurpassed
in the matter of industry of organiza-
tion of invention ours is the right
then to dream a little if we will to
find in good fiction escape from modern
struggle and strife

  to meet the need that is in all of
us for romance a great publishing house
has called on the best of the fiction writ-
ers of the day giving them free play
to let their fancy wander asking that
they tell us stories that will hold us
in their spell

  here are reviewed some of the most
recent books which that house has pub-
lished they are books about the great
west books of mystery fine clean love
stories they are chelsea house books
your guarantee of good reading the
four mentioned here may be had from
any reputable bookseller in your neigh-
borhood ask your dealer or write to

lashes your face you feel the heave and
surge of the deck beneath your feet
you participate in livingstons desperate
perils and his attempt at escape-one of
the most dramatic episodes in sea fiction

fills the pages of the cruise of the colleet
bawn-adventure that will make the blood
run fast and cause the pulse to quicken that
will set the nerves atingle

  readers who like a good sea yarn will be
delighted with this work of frank carruthers
it has all the thrill of an old-time pirate
romance with the novelty of being laid at
the present time the story is filled with
drama action and tense situations men
are tested by the sea as by no other element
in its grip weaklings rise to the heights of
heroism while physical giants quail before
its terrors frank carruthers has made a fine
contribution to the literature of the sea in
writing the cruise of the colleen bawn

a vivid tale that will live in the memory long
after the book has been laid aside

atr chang of scotland yard by a e

     apple price  cents published by
chelsea house  seventh avenue new york
city

  a murder without a motive is the height of
stupidity thus spoke the remarkable mr
chang when finally his pursuers caught up
with him but there were many real motives
behind certain of the strange deeds of mr
chang that were far from stupid the story
of the unraveling of these motives that set into
action this debonair quick-thinking oriental is
a fascinating one how well mr apple tells
it he leads you on from one exciting scene
to another in masterly style he makes you
hate and admire and almost respect his out-
standing character for those whose appetite
for detective stories has become a bit jaded i
recommend mr chang of scotland yard as
a first-class fillip

seems only yesterday that i was wondering if i would
ever make as much as  a week and now im

  tom dawson was speaking about it today gee he
said i wish i had started studying with the i c s
when you did here i am plugging away at the same
old job and the same old salary while youve gone way
up i bet youre making twice as much as i am and
to think that two years ago we were working side by side

   i told him it wasnt too late if he would only make
the start and he said he was going to end in one of
those i c s coupons right away

   i hope he does because an i c s course is the very
thing he needs to get out of the rut i wouldnt be
making anywhere near  a week if i hadnt started
to study just when i did

crest at the point where the stony slope
pitched downward to the spot where he
had made his camp sandy his burro
was browsing in the mesquite that
fringed the little spring at the foot of
the slope to the south and west arose
the higher hills of which the hogback
was a spur northwest northeast and
due north the far horizon was fretted
with purple peaks surrounding the flat
desert completely and making of it the
bottom of a great basin a sort of
natural amphitheater a moving drama

desert chivalry

eward was examining the
two halves of a piece of
float which he had just
broken with a hammer when
his eyes wandering desert-
wards for a moment glimpsed a scene
which amazed and startled him the
broken stone dropped from his hands
his tall form suddenly grew tense and
he turned half about in order that he
might face squarely the spectacle that
was unfolding below him

  the hogback liberally sprinkled with
the white float was lifted some forty
feet above the flat gray level to the
north seward was standing on the

scene had flashed upon his eyes seward
would almost have made oath that he
was the only human being within a
dozen miles and now what did he
see  a phantasmagoria of four figures
projected by the lantern of chance in
clear silhouette against the gray of the
desert three of the figures were
mounted and so distant that they were
little more than moving blots but the
fourth figure the one nearest the hog-
back was afoot and running to escape
the pursuing riders the person in
flight had evidently seen sandy and
was making desperate efforts to reach
the burro in the plain hope of finding a
camp and a refuge

  seward made a discovery and he
made it just as a puff of white smoke
arose from the pursuing horsemen fol-
lowed instantly by the dull report of a
rifle and a flurry of sand shooting into
the air near the runners feet the
person in flight was a woman a shawl-
like garment one end released fluttered
backward from the womans shoulders
as she lifted her arms in a mute expres-
sion of despair

  always ready to lend a helping hand
to any one in distress seward would
have hurried to the rescue even if the
fugitive had been a man making the
rescue preliminary to an investigation
into the rights or wrongs of the case
now with the discovery that it was a
woman so hard beset his desire to give
aid was redoubled

  hurrying down the slope to his camp
by the spring he caught his revolver
out of his scattered equipment and ran
to meet the woman as she came
closer he saw that she was young that
the fluttering shawl was her only head
covering and that her hair was as black
and shining as a ravens wing her
face tense and strained with her
physical exertions was of a warm olive
tint and her eyes were dark

   socorro senor she cried gasp-
ingly

  with one hand she clutched the fly-
ing rebozo convulsively about her
throat and half staggered from weak-
ness as she reached out the other hand
to seward he caught her as she
seemed about to fall the pursuers
were drawing close and they continued
to shoot from the backs of their plung-
ing horses they were poor marksmen
for the bullets all went wide wider than
they should even when fired from the
lurching saddles

  there were no seconds to waste in
talk with the one word animol
seward half dragged the girl to a shel-
ter of heaped-up boulders near the
spring there with a rocky breast-
work between them and the flying lead
they crouched and waited revolver in
hand seward peered over the tops of
the boulders

  who are you he asked alertly
watching the three horsemen

  faquita gonzales senor came the
answer breathlessly from beside him

  who are those men

  i do not know senor madre mia
they came upon me so quick my horse
threw me and ran away so i-i had
to do what i could without the caballo
bandidos senor-they must be

  a closer view of the three riders
lacked so much of being reassuring that
the girls suggestion of bandits seemed
close to the truth they were not
mexicans that was plain but bore the
earmarks of desperadoes originating
north of the border they were poorly
mounted and only two of them had
rifles

  desert scum muttered seward
brave enough the three of them to
attack a lone woman lets see if they
are as yellow as the average of their
kind

  the three men were galloping up
and down in front of the rock pile each
turn of the contracting circle bringing
them nearer seward fired a shot the
distance was too great for accurate re-
east of sunrise



volver practice but immediately the
three dug in with their heels and re-
treated seward muttered his con-
tempt leaped from behind his rock
screen and pushed boldly across the
open firing as he went

  it was ludicrous to see the three des-
ert rats crowd their mounts into the
breeze now that the senorita had
found a champion they lost heart and
after firing a few volleys they pointed
their horses back along the way they
had come turning to shout a defiance
which they had not the courage to fol-
low up with aggressive action

  seward laughing grimly made his
way back to the rock barrier you
may as well come out senorita he
said theyre coyotes like most of their
kind and have made off

  the girl arose and stood by the boul-
ders she was still breathing heavily
and her cheeks were flushed-a rose
hue brightening the olive skin her
eyebrows were straight and black and
her eyes were black-of the same mid-
night hue as her hair the rebozo was
of silk-black and yellow a blouselike
waist was caught together at her throat
with a great red jewel her short skirt
was ornamented with bright silver but-
tons and she wore leggings and high-
heeled shoes about her waist was a
fancy carved - leather belt from which
swung a small hand bag

  she was pretty very pretty and
seward had an odd impression that he
had seen her somewhere before he
racked his memory was it merely a
mistaken fancy

  you have saved my life senor she
said softly leaning against the boulders
and flashing her eyes upon him and
you have saved the money-here she
struck one hand against the small bag
at her belt-which i am taking to tia
bianca over east of sunrise canon
gracias mil gra-cias

  her voice her manner still further
nagged at sewards memory he was

sure by now that he had seen the girl
before

  havent i met you somewhere be-
fore he inquired

  never senor that i can remember
she answered shaking her head and
unmasking a devastating smile i be-
lieve if you please that i will have a
drink

  she moved toward the spring ap-
parently as little concerned over her
recent escape as though fleeing from
desperadoes was an everyday occur-
rence sewards long desert experience
had taught him to note little things that
would escape the ordinary observer he
noticed her coolness her quick adjust-
ment to matters as they were follow-
ing on the heels of a narrowly averted
tragedy he followed her to the
spring got a tin cup from his pack and
filled it with water all the while with
a growing suspicion that something was
wrong

  i am sorry to have been so much
trouble to you senor she said return-
ing the empty cup

  he spread a blanket for her in a
scrap of shade and she seated herself
tailorwise upon it she lifted the rebozo
to drape her head and all the while her
black eyes were considering gravely the
man before her

  americano si she asked

  si he answered shortly for it was
a casual question a foolish question
with sewards nationality standing out
so clear

  and the name please i wish to
know in order that i may tell tia
bianca and tio juan to whom i am so
very much indebted her english was
good and with scarcely an accent

  seward is the name he told her

  she started her eyes widened not
-please tell me she breathed not

so many stories

admitted im a prospector and i was

sampling the float on the hogback when
you happened along chance seno-
rita

  the girl fell into a dreamy state a
sort of waking trance in which she
mused aloud in all these deserts
her rippling voice flowed on where
there are so few real men to be found
it has been my fate to be saved by
seward of sacatone the caballero
whose fame for good deeds has gone
everywhere his courage his kind-
ness his-

  there was nothing pleasing to se-
ward in all this it would have been
distasteful even if the girls voice and
manner had been sincere which they
were not he had been rolling a ciga-
rette as he reached for a match he
broke into the flowing monologue
your relations live east of sunrise
canon he inquired

  si senor seward she answered
lifting her head and her white teeth
flashing a smile i started alone from
forty-mile to take my uncle and aunt
a few hundred pesos left to them by
tio enrico tio juans brother who has
but recently died those bandidos must
have known they must have followed
to rob me

  forty-mile seward had a clew
from forty-mile to sunrise canon
senorita he suggested is a long ride
for a woman all of sixty miles

  not for a woman who knows the
deserts senor i am at home in the
deserts

  you live at forty-mile

  i lived with tio enrico she ex-
plained  you must have heard of him-
enrico silva of the posada del rey
nino now i shall have to live there
with a cousin it is ones fate she said
with a sigh when one has no padre no
madre i suppose she inquired arch-
ly that you will take me to tia
bianca you are always of so great
help to those who are in need

  here was a complication not at all to

sewards liking the desert is nothing
if not unconventional but seward of
sacatone had his own high ideals
chivalry demanded that much of him
however and he bowed to the inevitable
much as he disliked it he flashed a
look at the sun

  you must be hungry he said and
inasmuch as you are here and we both
must eat i shall get supper- it will
be rough fare he added

  it will be a banquet she returned
if prepared by seward of sacatone

  he went grimly about his prepara-
tions for he had suddenly placed this
girl whose home was at the posada del
rey nino in forty-mile he remem-
bered the posada for it had figured
almost tragically in an adventure of
some months past when he had helped
newton ranee of quinlan to save his
son from a gang of sharpers the po-
sada housed one of the crookedest
gambling layouts in the southwest and
faquita gonzales had dealt faro in that
nest of guile and trickery la joya
she was called the jewel from that
sparkling red stone at her throat

chapter ii

when hate overcame judgment

twang the six-foot bow bent
nearly double with the masterful
fifty-pound pull on its leathern string
the arrow long slender and tipped
with razor-edged steel cruelly barbed
launched itself straight upward into the
eye of the midday sun the polished
head flashing like a streak of fire

  chombo el arquero half-breed horse
trader by profession and master bow-
man in his hours of leisure lowered
the bow and stepped backward to lean
against one of the four-by-fours sup-
porting the roof of his hay shed the
shaft he had sped sunward was lost to
sight and chombos interest was now
in the target-a six-inch square of
brown paper marked with a bulls-eye
east of sunrise



and spread flat on the ground a dozen
feet from where he stood

  ordinary shots of seventy-five or a
hundred yards at an elevated target
were childs play for him and he held
them in contempt but to lose an arrow
in the sky and then to have it return
and pierce a target not twelve feet from
the spot where the bow was bent-that
was a feat par excellence the very
chef-doeuvre of a prince of archers

  so many things entered into the mat-
ter so much depended on the sure judg-
ment the perfect execution the aim
zenithward must be deflected by just
the hairs breadth that in the course of
a long flight would cover exactly the
few feet to the target the arrow had
to be perfect in hang and balance and
above all there was allowance to be
made for the slightest cats-paw of
wind

  chombo was cunning and certain at
all these calculations he was a half-
blood peon mexican and yaqui and it
was the yaqui strain in him that gave
him his love for the bow and arrow

  he made his own bows and went
questing into the high sierras for a cer-
tain springy evergreen that more than
matched the english yew his arrows
were works of art slim and strong the
haft feathered with eagles plumage
deftly trimmed and the point worked
from steel polished and ground to a
hair-splitting edge

  chombo lived alone at his ranch a
few miles off the quinlan trail to tres
alamos no man ever came to him
except for horses or burros he had no
love for company and but little more
for customers he had all grades of
harness saddle and pack stock herded
in his round corrals by night and scat-
tered abroad in his wide grass valley
by day three half-breeds like himself
were his herdsmen

  his target range was the wide space
between the rear of his adobe house
and his hay shed he was well-to-do

and while his men cared for his stock
he played soltaire brewed tiswin from
the flowers of the saguaro cactus
smoked cornhusk cigarros and amused
himself with the long bow

  the arrow was gone a long time as
arrow flights are counted and chombo
lighted a cigarro as he leaned against
the hay-shed post then at last it
came rushing earthward the barbed tip
glowing like a falling star plump
chombo heaved a grunt of satisfaction
once more he had accomplished the
seemingly impossible for the shaft had
buried itself in the earth by half its
length-exactly in the center of the
bulls-eye

 bravo chombo exclaimed a
voice

  the half-breed whirled in his tracks
a woman had stepped out from behind
a corner of the adobe house-a slender
woman who walked with a quick sure
step wore divided skirts and a mannish
sombrero the sombrero was skewered
to her brownish hair by a hatpin that
showed on both sides of the crown the
blade-tip and hilt of a small dagger
the brim of the hat was upturned in
front and over it and the womans face
was a gray veil

  huh muttered chombo scowling
who you what you want eh ca-
ballos

  a short laugh came from behind the
veil are we alone here the woman
asked

  me i am always alone-daytimes
why

  a gloved right hand with a quirt
dangling from the wrist arose to lift
the veil the ordinarily impassive face
of the half-breed showed just a flicke
of surprise

  lola sanger huh it is said
around you have left the country

  the veil dropped leave the coun-
try while my brothers score is unset-
tled there was a tigerish hunching
of the slender shoulders a clenching of

the gloved hands you knew dirk
chombo and i thought you knew me

  how settle demanded chombo
showing interest seward caught the
two of you and put you in jail me i
came by night and passed you files and
a hacksaw you cut the window bars
and make escape on two horses i have
waiting dirk goes loco makes fool of
himself he kills robs and tries to get
seward what happens eh seward
get him over at old esmeralda now
dirk sanger is back in cell in double
irons you want me to help him
escape manana chombo shook his
head it is too much

  there is no getting dirk away from
the sheriff at tres alamos agreed the
other he has made his bed and must
lie in it but theres seward of saca-
tone i have him like this she put
up both hands open and clenched them
savagely like this chombo she
breathed if you will help

  seward get seward the dark
eyes of the half-breed flashed at the
prospect but the light faded and he
shook his head ominously no can
do nobody can do

  the girl came a step closer inclining
her body forward in her earnestness

  you hate him dirk hates him i
hate him you have too much sense
to believe those yarns about his being
in two places at the same time about
his shooting three guns at once and put-
ting three bullets through the middle
pips of three treys moonshine all of
it chombo just as much moonshine as
the story that he is bulletproof or she
added arrowproof how does the ar-
row fly with only the twang of bow-
string and you can smother that at
a hundred yards would he be an easy
target would you care to launch a
dart at him at a hundred yards-and
from cover

  the lean brown face of chombo
twisted into the look of a demon
pleased and trying to smile hate se-

ward of sacatone he all chombos
heathen gods had been busy listening to
his prayers for revenge seward of
sacatone had spoiled the sale of a dozen
head of choice saddle stock to the east-
erner who had taken over the j-o
ranch in grass valley-spoiled it by
showing how some of the choice
stock was wind-broken and spavined
and double value being asked for all the
rest this was something the horse
trader could not forget

  he slapped at the unstrung bow and
stepped forward to wrench the arrow
from the ground a wolfish snarl
dropped from his lips show me
cover he said show me seward at
a hundred yards then see

  the girl echoed the snarl with a
laugh of her own i knew i could de-
pend on you she exclaimed now
listen the five thousand dollars in
gold at simms  norcross has been
sent to cerillas in charge of seward
he totes it on his burro in saddlebags
but he prospects by the way for there
is no particular hurry about the de-
livery seward is now along the her-
mosito trail his trail will be crossed
by la joya of forty-mile you know
la joya

  chombo nodded listening intently
you also know sewards bluff of
wanting to help everybody well when
la joya crosses his trail she will to all
appearances be needing help he
will give it and she will lead him to
the pass through the hills east of sun-
rise canon a prettier place for an
ambush you could not find you know
the place chombo

  chombos nostrils dilated he took
pleasure in the thought he regarded
his bow-and the arrow the silent mes-
senger to carry his hate what she
do this la joya he demanded eager-
ly seward is a fox your brother
dirk could not fool him

  la joya is a woman and a woman
can fool him he will do for a woman
east of sunrise



in distress what he would not do for a
man chombo why when he was
bringing dirk and me in from tum-
bling stone mountain prisoners bound
for tres alamos he stopped in the old
trail and offered to let me come here to
you get a horse and ride for the rail-
road his name for that is chivalry

  bah the half-breed had the full
bloods ideas of a squaw what is to
be done then he wanted to know

  i want a fresh horse and a fast
one replied the girl and you also
must have a good mount well have
to start at once for the pass east of
sunrise and ride hard la joya knows
and will delay until we have time to get
there she has help from forty-mile
hangers-on of the posada but they are
scared to death of seward they will
go so far in helping la joya but no
further you alone can turn the big
trick chombo will you go

  the half-breed looked into vacancy
pondering at last his hate overcame
his better judgment si he burst out
suddenly

  the girl laughed gleefully i have
been hiding out at forty-mile with la
joya she went on and she and i
have gone over our plans so many times
that there can be no mistake dirk at
the best will go to yuma for life but
seward will pay he will be made to
count the cost of his private war with
dirk and then i can leave these des-
erts for good and be content but get
the horses chombo she added briskly
ill be waiting for you on the porch
of your adobe

  chombo turned quickly on his moc-
casined feet and ran in through the
rear door of the adobe there he left
his bow and arrow and emerged with a
rope and a bridle

  in half an hour he called as he
loped away in the direction of the val-
ley and his horse herd

  lola sanger passed around the house
to the porch the two had scarcely

vanished before a pair of heads arose
from behind the hay bales one head
wore a battered sun helmet and a shock
of long red hair showed beneath the
brim of it the other head was capped
with an old sombrero and the face be-
neath was weather-beaten swarthy and
pockmarked

  the man in the sun helmet whistled
say eph what dyu know he mut-
tered walt sewards got a kick-off
cornin

  git the canteen and lets climb out
o this red insisted the man in the
battered sombrero if chombo had
any notion we was around to listen in
hed a pinned both of us to these hay
bales with a couple o them arrers im
fer pullin our freight an doin it quick
wheres the canteen

  out in the valley the day before
red galloway and eph springer
had bargained with one of chombos
herdsmen for a canteen of tiswin it
was to be concealed between two of the
hay bales and the price of the tiswin
had been a small nugget that the two
desert hobos had found or stolen

  here she is  muttered red pulling
at a strap and lifting a small canteen
into view the canteen was so small
in fact that red swore luridly that
nugget would assay twenty dollars
easy he growled and two pints is all
we git fer it

chapter iii

springing a sensation

the sheriff at tres alamos jerry

  blake had a name for men like red
galloway and eph springer he called
them grubbers grubbers are the
hobos of the desert country but they
go the ordinary tramp one better al-
though their wanderings may be aim-
less their purposes have a set direction
any man who can be begged or cajoled
into giving them a grubstake is their
quarry

  they pretend to be prospectors
many of them possess sufficient knowl-
edge of mineral indications and of ore
pockets and pay streaks to make ex-
cellent prospectors but the profes-
sional grubber is too lazy if he can
by an agreement to turn over half his
prospective discoveries to the person
who grubstakes him receive a three-
months supply of bacon beans and
flour he will vanish into some com-
fortable spot in the desert and loaf
away his time while the food lasts

  when the food gives out he will re-
turn to the easy mark who grubstaked
him with a piece f very rich ore in an
empty tobacco sack or an old sock or
a bit of dirty cloth and claim that he
has found a lead of that kind of stuff
hut that it will take him another three
months to develop the find and see
just what hes got the grubstaker
thinking he has a half interest with the
grubber in a prospective fortune fur-
nishes another three-months supply of
bacon beans and flour and the grub-
ber returns to his old camp in the des-
ert and enjoys another three months
of idleness with the same piece of
rich ore which he has stolen some-
where and which is his whole stock in
trade he will look around for another
likely person whom it is possible to be-
guile

  this is the grubbers method it is
the way he supports himself in idleness
and keeps his wretched body and soul
together he is a flimflammer and if
any other method of acquiring easy
money presents itself as feasible he
will adopt it promptly even though it
hinges upon crime

  a grubber is not a true prospector
nor is a true prospector a grubber the
mountains and mesas are filled with
honest gold hunters who if they are
grubstaked go searching industriously
for precious metal but men like red
galloway and eph springer are not of
this type

  some grubbers travel afoot toting a
bag of provisions and a canteen of
water others more fortunate own a
hurro and some may rise to the dignity
of owning a horse but between foot-
grubbers burro-grubbers and horse-
grubbers there is a difference merely
of degree

  galloway and springer were so wide-
ly known in those deserts that it was
becoming increasingly hard for them to
find any one from whom they could se-
cure a grubstake because they knew
all the water holes and springs where
not only water but a forage of grama-
grass and mesquite beans could be had
they were able to keep their horses after
a fashion but they were almost at the
last extremity when instead of ex-
changing a six-dollar nugget for food
they passed it to a treacherous herds-
man for a tin canteen of tiswin it was
their plan to forget their troubles tem-
porarily by using a little illegal fire
water

  they rode that early afternoon to a
spot near the old tumbling stone trail
where a dribble of water and a few
nibbles of scant grass would keep the
breath of life in their horses they had
a little bacon but thought best to save
it for eph had killed a chuckwalla
which weighed three pounds dressed
they built a fire roasted the lizard be-
east of sunrise



tween two hot stones and had a piece de
resistance to go with their fire water

  for almost a year they had hunted
in couples they called thetnselves
pards tiswin however is said to
be a drink with fight in it and they be-
gan quarreling as they divided the
chuckwalla there was a division of
opinion too on another matter

  they knew seward of sacatone he
had caught them stealing on one occa-
sion and instead of taking them to jail
he had sent them over the border into
mexico on returning from sonora
they had another encounter with se-
ward which fell just short of being
disastrous

  they held seward in dread for they
believed fully all the legends that dealt
with his superhuman powers if he
told them- to do anything they did it
for they were convinced that he would
put the blight of the evil eye upon them
if they failed to carry out his orders
they knew too that if they did a
friendly act for seward he would be
found grateful somehow seward al-
though he had never made a strike
always bad money all this gave eph
springer an idea

  red said he over the last of the
chuckwalla the aint no manner o
use o you and me fightin we got a
chance to pull down a grubstake
meanin which grunted galloway
aint we jest heard somethin which
seward would be mighty glad to know 
a scheme is afoot to do him up us
two could tell him about it and like as
not hed come across with ten twenty
or mebby fifty pesos we could take
things easy fer a spell on fifty pesos
galloway had imbibed enough tiswin
to feel an unaccustomed energy flowing
through his veins he showed interest
for his wits were not so fuddled but
that the logic of springers remarks ap-
pealed to him

  sufferin sidewinders he mut-
tered it shore looks like a good bet

eph but the moharrie and chombo
is travelin on a couple o fast caballos
we couldnt never expect to get to that
place east o sunrise afore them two got
there

  say listen said springer his en-
thusiasm growing as bis mind devel-
oped the plan us two could foller
down the hennosito trail till we found
seward and this here la joya mohar-
rie we could spill the beans about
that faro dealer afore ever them two
reached the pass east o sunrise meb-
by seward ud shell out a hundred
pesos wed be savin his life wouldnt
we  seems like we owe it to him after
he got us clear o that dirk sanger
otherwise guido fresco like he done

  or heres another scheme spring-
er went on apparently embarrassed
by the ideas that suddenly laid hold of
him us two could go to tres alamos
gettin there afore sundown and we
could bat up the scheme to that mohar-
rie the norcross girl whose dad is a
partner o simms in the general store
seward was to pick up five thousand
dollars in gold and deliver it in los
cerillos mebby we could stop seward
afore he got started that ethel nor-
cross would whack up a big grubstake
right offn the store shelves for a red-
hot tip about what we got next to over
at chombos

  and then theres something else
springer expanded apparently doing
all the thinking for both himself and
his partner us two could go to the
sheriff and tell him where he could find
this lola sanger there was a thou-
sand paid fer bringin in dirk sanger
and mebby hed make a deal fer infer-
mation about the moharrie

  now yu are plumb loco scoffed
galloway the farther we can keep
away from sheriffs the better were off
nary eph our best bet is to go hunt-
in seward out hermosito way were
near the end of our grub but if we
can locate seward and tell him whats


top-notch magazine

on our minds ill bet hed give us the
run o his camp

  tres alamos is nigher and we
could hit that burg afore sundown im
fer goin there red and seein what
the moharrie  do fer us simms 
norcross stand to lose five thousand
pesos and ill gamble a blue stack that
theyll be plumb libral with us-with
the moharrie on our side

  galloway was dubious about that
that norcross moharrie aint got any
friendly feelin fer us eph as yu ort
to know he objected

 but her and walt seward are
friends and shed do a lot fer seward
tell yu what eph galloway sug-
gested as a brilliant idea crossed his
wits well seprate yu kin go to
tres alamos and work simms  nor-
cross and ill take the scatterin o grub
we got left an hike out the hermosito
trail you put it over in the town and
ill put it over with seward mebby
well pick up a couple o grubstakes by
workin both ends o this string how
about it

  it looked promising to the two des-
ert hobos but they almost came to
blows when they reached the point of
dividing the scanty store of food and
the small supply of tiswin that was left

  no use yore tryin to hog every-
thin grumbled springer im takin
more chances in town than what yu are
takin along the hermosito trail

  im needin more grub in case i
cant make a go of it argued gallo-
way and look whats lible to hap-
pen if i should fall in with chombo and
the moharrie

  yud be all right yu wouldnt tell
em nothin

  as fer that yure playin a safe
thing if sewards gone on his way
tell what yu know and yure bound to
be treated hansome me now-say
im takin all the chances

  before they had finished the argu-
ment each had reached for his dirk

but calmer counsel prevailed when
springer began to see galloways side
of the contention

  buenos he grunted one more
drink from the canteen red and well
part compny wherell we meet up
agin dead mule flat

  shore assented galloway bring
yore grubstake there and ill bring mine
-if i happen to rustle one he
cocked one eye at the sun i allow
its cool enough to be movin eph
lets strike out

  they mounted their sorry steeds
bade each other adios and galloway
struck out for the hermosito trail
while springer pushed for tres
alamos

  it was five oclock in the afternoon
when springer clattered into the town
the trail he was following led directly
into the main street with the county
courthouse and jail among the first
buildings he would have to pass these
were public institutions with which he
was entirely out of sympathy for good
and sufficient reasons so he turned into
a back street and came to the general
store of simms  norcross by a round-
about course

  leaving his horse at the hitching rail
he passed through the open front doors
with all the assurance he could muster
a brown-eyed brown-haired girl was
waiting on a woman customer in the
dry-goods department when she saw
springer a look of astonishment crossed
her pretty face-a look which almost
immediately gave place to an expres-
sion of dislike and suspicion springer
calling upon all the little courage he
possessed stepped to the counter

  miss norcross he inquired has
seward of sacatone left for cerillos
with that gold

  ethel norcross dropped the scissors
which she was about to use on a bolt of
cloth but being a girl of determina-
tion and spirit she immediately com-
posed herself if you will sit down
east of sunrise



mr springer she replied i will talk
with you in a moment

  there aint no time to lose if se-
ward aint been here yet springer told
her

  the girl gave him a quick look mr
seward she answered started on a
prospecting trip yesterday morning
just a minute please

  a look of worry flooded her eyes
for no doubt she had a premonition that
there was evil news about to be un-
folded as soon as she had finished
waiting on the customer she went to
a desk in the back part of the store and
spoke to the senior partner mr simms
mr simms face was presently reflect-
ing his own worry and he got up from
the desk and motioned to springer
opening the door of a rear room he
waved springer inside

  well talk with him ethel said the
senior partner and find out if we can
where he got his information

  the three of them went into the rear
room the door was closed and a very
private consultation went forward for
once in his life at least eph springer
was springing a sensation

chapter iv

trouble ahead

in the early morning of the day pre-
ceding his unusual experience at the
hogback seward had trailed his burro
out of tres alamos a foreboding of
the kind which he humorously referred
to as a trouble-hunch accompanied
him as he left the town it was with
him there in his camp by the hogback
furthermore it was taking a clearer
and more disturbing form with his re-
cent experiences

  it seemed to him that he had a vague
indefinite sixth sense a mentor which
cm occasion rose up out of his subcon-
sciousness to warn him of misfortunes
ahead two days before setting out on
this particular prospecting trip he had

arrived in tres alamos from the old
esmeralda mine with dirk sanger and
three card churchill neatly roped
astride a led horse he had turned his
prisoners over to jerry blake the sher-
iff and blake had agreed to take him
in the official buckboard out to pete
dobles ten-strike property where
sandy was being cared for pending se-
wards return from his bandit hunting

  the sheriff had told the prospector
that ethel norcross wanted to see him
and that as soon as the buckboard was
ready it would pick him up at simms
 norcross general store so seward
had gone to the store and had been re-
quested by norcross to climb the out-
side stairs to the living rooms where
he would find ethel waiting with a very
important message for him

  having ascended the stairs seward
waited at the open door at the top
ethel was playing a melodeon and sing-
ing as she played

     east of sunrise falls the night

west of sundown breaks the day

    and we find our brightest light
      where the darkness paves our way

  in that moment as he listened to the
soft voice lifted m song the still small
voice of sewards mentor spoke to him
that song has a meaning for you
walt pay attention

  ethels important message had to do
with five thousand dollars in gold dou-
ble eagles in the safe of simms  nor-
cross it appeared that an easterner
named sparling who had taken over
the pelican mine near los cerillos
wanted just five thousand dollars in
cash for a deal in which checks or any
other sort of negotiable paper would
not serve there was no bank in
cerillos and none in tres alamos and
simms  mccann later simms  nor-
cross had found it good business to
carry a fairly large amount of money
in their safe for the cashing of checks
thus accommodating some of their cus-
tomers who would otherwise have been


top-notch magazine

obliged to go to quinlan the nearest
railroad town to realize on their
paper

  simms  norcross it seemed had
received a letter from one of their east-
ern correspondents testifying to the
financial responsibility of mr victor
sparling and requesting them to help
him in his venture in los cerillos in
any way possible so when sparling
sent them a letter inclosing his new
york check for five thousand dollars
and asking them to send him the cash
any time within a month simms 
norcross wanted to oblige him

  ethel norcross was willing to take
the money to los cerillos but in view
of certain robberies that had recently
been committed in that section both
members of the firm thought this pro-
ceeding altogether too risky for a
woman it had occurred to simms
that seward might be prospecting to
the south and west and if he were
would he take the five thousand dollars
in his pack drop in at los cerillos any
time within a month and deliver the
money to mr sparling at the pelican
mine 

  seward was known to be an accom-
modating person and he was really
planning his next prospecting trip in
the direction indicated therefore in-
asmuch as time did not appear to be an
important matter in the delivery of the
money he was glad to oblige the firm
-and save ethel norcross a venture-
some trip-by accepting the commis-
sion a little later he boarded the buck-
board for the ride to the ten-strike
mine with the first vague premonition
of trouble taking shape in his mind

  deferring to his premonition-
for he had never found his mentor
to be unreliable-he had secured from
pete doble about thirteen pounds of
iron washers doble had kept them on
hand for years part of a supply of old
junk which he had picked up at an auc-
tion doble was a great hand for buy-

ing stuff at auctions he was curious
to know what seward wanted of the
iron washers which were too large for
ordinary bolts and used largely in
bridge building but seward did not
feel inclined to explain he merely
grinned at his friend and kept his own
counsel

  in the early morning when he had
trailed sandy out of tres alamos he
had the five thousand dollars in gold
safely stowed in the burros pack in a
pair of saddlebags in transporting the
gold he considered himself under a
double obligation norcross and his
daughter especially the daughter were
his very good friends and he had
known mr and mrs victor sparling
in the east long years before and he
was eager to serve them in any way in
his power

  in a day and a half he had reached
the hogback and pitched his camp for
he had for some time wanted to investi-
gate the float to discover whether it
was really float from the mountains
above or merely a blow-out and all
the time he was making his journey to
the hogback and after he had settled
down there for a few days investigat-
ing his sixth sense was continually
dinning in his ears lookout trou-
ble ahead

  his meeting with la joya was the
first bolt from the blue her almost
tragic experience with the bandidos
did not ring true and recognizing her
as a faro dealer from one of the worst
gambling hells in those parts did not
serve to reassure him

  i think he told her after they had
finished their supper and the sun had
set and the embers of the camp fire
were dying i think senorita that we
had better start for the pass east of
sunrise canon to-night there will be
a moon you can ride the burro and it
will be pleasanter traveling by night
than by day by to-morrow forenoon
before the sun gets too warm for com-
east of sunrise



fort you ought to be with your uncle
and aunt

  the senorita however was against
that she was tired oh so tired real-
ly she must rest she knew that she
was a great bother to senor seward
and she was sorry but it was absolutely
impossible for her to go on that night
she was used to the deserts and if he
would only give her a blanket she
would roll up in it and look out for
herself

  seward was annoyed by this refusal
but he was as lola sanger had told
chombo a chivalrous knight of the
desert he bowed to the senoritas
wishes cut some soft brushtops cov-
ered them with a blanket and left the
girl the run of the camp with a saw-
buck saddle for a pillow and a canvas
tarp for covering he went off into
the chaparral and tried to get his nights
rest

  then something else occurred to op-
press him there was a stinging sensa-
tion in his eyes not painful exactly
but a burning that suggested dire
things he had experienced it before
-three times only in all his desert ex-
perience of five years it was a pre-
monitory warning that the glare of the
sun on the sand was affecting his sight
very much as the suns glare on white
snow sun-blindness was indicated if
he had been by himself he would have
passed the next day in idleness his eyes
bandaged to keep out the glare but
with the senorita on his hands and re-
fusing to cross the deserts by night it
was impossible for him to take the
usual precautions which were necessary
in the circumstances

  a doctor had given him an ointment
for use in such cases and he got the
tin out of his first-aid kit applied some
of the ointment to his eyelids and cov-
ered his eyes with a gauze bandage he
hoped that would prevent the blindness
at least until he had conducted the
senorita to the pass east of sunrise

canon and had gone on to cerillos and
delivered the money to sparling

  next morning his eyes were better
and in the gray dawn he set about
building a fire and preparing breakfast
he did not call the sefiorita until the
meal was ready then at the first word
from him the girl appeared from the
blanket roll bright and smiling

  she had enjoyed a wonderful nights
rest she declared in response to se-
wards greeting such a wonderful air
as there was in the deserts  like wine
was it not she prattled on shook the
sand out of her rebozo dusted her
clothing and went to the spring to bathe
her face in the cool water she came
to breakfast with every strand of her
glossy black hair in place as fresh as
the morning itself

  she found seward looking at the sun
the orb of day was not as bright as
usual but had a faint foggy look as
though a veil had been dropped be-
fore it

 why do you examine the sky
senor she inquired

 the day answered seward
weatherwise is going to be very warm
and still and it opens with promise of
a sandstorm senorita

  then we must not venture across
the deserts she exclaimed i know
these storms we must stay in camp
pardon me returned seward but
i think it will be noon or later before
the dust storm comes we can reach a
place i know where there is water and
rough country for a refuge of course
the storm may not come it doesnt al-
ways come when the morning sun is
like that it is best i think he added
gravely to be on our way

  la joya pouted and tossed her head
i shall not stir she declared por
dios if we were caught in a sand-
storm i should perish i do not choose
to be suffocated with heat and stran-
gled with the whirling sand

  she was a like a spoiled child se-


top-notch magazine

ward could have insisted but it oc-
curred to him that with another day in
the canap he could look after his eyes
he brought sandy closer to the spring
and picketed him then with a fresh
bandage on his eyes he sought a scrap
of shade and composed himself for a
day of enforced idleness the senorita
was very curious about the bandage

  occasionally he explained not
often but occasionally my eyes warn
me that the sun is affecting them i
feel that warning now and the bandage
is just a precaution what he in-
quired does your uncle do in the pass
east of the sunrise canon senorita
he is a hauler of wood senor was
the answer for the pelican mine near
los cerillos tia bianca stays in the
adobe in the pass while tio juan is
away with his wagons

  the adobe is in the pass seward
asked

  by the spring si exactly in the
pass

  of his own knowledge seward knew
that there was no spring in the pass and
no adobe why was the girl lying to
him but he was a patient man held
his peace and was eager only to be quit
of the obligation he considered himself
under to the senorita

  perhaps it was ten oclock when the
temperamental senorita changed her
mind about proceeding to the pass i
dont believe there will be any sand-
storm senor she said perhaps after
all we had better be traveling

  sewards judgment was now all
against the traveling with such a late
start the fog about the sun was thick-
ening and the air was like the breath
of a furnace

  no senorita he told her with
such a late start it is not wise

  very well answered the senorita
then i will walk

  she would have persisted in that
madness and even made a start in spite
of sewards protests

  all right said the patient seward
if we hurry a bit we may get to the
water hole

  he removed the bandage from his
eyes and began making sandy ready
for the trip

chapter v

the black curtain

in dealing with this capricious young
woman seward was of a mind to
use his best judgment and make her
abide by it but the moment he had
removed the bandage the swirling black
specks that interfered with his vision
convinced him that the calamity he had
sought to guard against was inevitable
in a few hours the black curtain would
fall and he would be blinded not for
long-a day at the least a few days at
the most but if he lost his sight even
for an hour with the gold in his charge
and a woman under his protection whom
he had good reason to distrust such a
sightless hour might easily result in un-
happy complications

  with the senorita lying to him about
her uncle and her aunt he was minded
to push on to los cerillos if the mex-
icana insisted on stopping at the pass
he would leave her to take her own
course either she must listen to rea-
son or suffer the consequences of her
own folly with luck on his side he
might be able to reach los cerillos be-
fore his eyes failed him completely

  if blindness overtook him while he
was in the camp by the hogback the
three horsemen whom the girl called
bandidos-and who might be her con-
federates and not her enemies-would
find him an easy prey so the senoritas
desire to be traveling was assented to
as the best move possible in the cir-
cumstances

  he cached some of his equipment
and he did this secretly while the girl
went to pull the picket pin and lead
sandy to the spring with the blanket
east of sunrise



he cushioned a seat for her on the bur-
ros back and then with his revolver
thrust into a breast holster and the
holster belted against his chest to hold
it flat they got under way

  crossing the hogback was a trying
performance for sandy in the swelter-
ing heat but he was a plucky little brute
and tireless descending the opposite
slope they laid their course toward the
distant hills the pass and sunrise
canon the water hole- seward had in
mind was several miles north of the
pass just where the low foothills began
to lift themselves above the flat desert

  there were moments when seward
could not see at all moments when a
rolling inky cloud obscured his vision
entirely then burst into fragments like
an exploding rocket spangling earth
and sky with spots as black as midnight
then for a time his sight would clear
and be almost normal he closed his
eyes as he tramped beside the burro
holding to the rope that secured the
blanket to sandys back

  at last a sudden hot blast of air
struck the back of his neck it was the
first stir of wind and seemed to come
over a bed of blazing coals he opened
his eyes to see the desert dust lifting
like smoke and rolling knee-deep
across the flats he knew then that
they could go no farther he halted
the burro and faced him around

  what are you going to do senor
asked the senorita

  get back to the lee of the hogback
he told her going on like this is out
of the question -

  we cant make it she cried shrilly

  we can try at any rate

  they were not halfway on the back
trail when a dull roaring sound came
out of the north the sky in that di-
rection was filled with a rolling fog of
dust it was the simoon bearing down
upon them

  get down senorita ordered se-
ward

 why what for

  if you know these deserts then you
have asked a foolish question we must
do what we can to weather this storm
he helped the girl to alight and
forced the burro to lie down then re-
moving the blanket he made his com-
panion kneel close to the burro and
draped the blanket over her head

  madre mia the senorita gasped
i shall smother

  it is the best we can do answered
seward dropping down and pulling the
tarpaulin over his head and shoulders

  the next moment they were in the
thkk of it the roaring wind drove the
sand against the glazed tarp and be-
gan piling drifts about the girl seward
and the burro it was difficult to
breathe and what air they did take into
their lungs was gritty with sand par-
ticles and hot as fire the senorita be-
gan to moan and to huddle closer to the
burro the burro snorted and struggled
and seward reached out a hand to stroke
his furry neck and quiet him

  the tarp one corner released was
torn out of sewards grasp he arose
and plunged after it regaining it again
after a wild race of some fifty feet he
found it lodged against a greasewood
bush seeing it plainly for a moment as
he gathered it up in his arms then
as he turned to face the blast and make
his way to the burro and the girl the
black curtain dropped and he knew it
would be hours before he could see
again-hours and perhaps days

  with the wind in his face and the
flying sand biting into his skin he grim-
ly fought his way in the teeth of it
that was his course he called aloud
shouted at the top of his lungs and then
fell silent as he listened for some an-
swering call to guide him none came

  seward groped about in the turmoil
fighting against the blast for every step
again and again he lifted his voice in
a call to the girl only the roaring
whisper of the sand filled his ears and


top-notch magazine

there was no other response he sank
down where he was resolved to wait
until the storm had spent its fury and
then to continue his searching

  he could not be far from sandy and
the girl his plunge after the tarp was
only fifty feet and yet in retracing his
course he had lost his bearings if he
continued his efforts to reach the burro
and the girl he might only succeed in
getting farther and farther away from
them had the use of his eyes been
allowed him he could have done no bet-
ter for the curtain of sand dosed him
in completely and to see more than a
few feet in any direction was an im-
possibility

  with his back to the wind he
crouched low in a growing drift of
sand minutes dragged like hours as
he panted for air under the suffocating
tarp and then by degrees the roar
began to die down the peak of the
storm had passed with the dying
whisper of the wind in his ears seward
arose and threw aside the tarp

  although it could not have been more
than high noon the blackness of mid-
night was all around him senorita
he called trumpeting through his hands

  still there was no answer he kicked
himself clear of the sand drift fumbled
until he had recovered ths tarpaulin and
began an aimless wandering the slight
breath of wind was from the north so
he faced it confident that he was pro-
ceeding in the direction of the hogback
but where was the girl what had
become of her

  he thought of the gold had she
taken sandy and made off with him
and the weighted saddlebags had that
been her purpose all along had she
fooled him with her bandidos her
talk of the little inheritance for tia
bianca her request that he should help
her on to the pass  had she dared the
sandstorm in the hope that it might of-
fer an opportunity for her to escape
with the burro and the gold 

  he could ask himself numberless
questions but the answers to them were
all beyond him suppose on the other
hand he was doing the girl an injustice
by his suspicions there was always
that possibility the faro dealer at the
posada might have forgotten his visit at
forty-mile that had happened long
ago and the wood hauler and his
family might have moved into the pass
since seward was through it last if
the senorita was sincere if she was
really in distress then it was sewards
duty to find her

  he struggled about in the desert
stumbling against the fishhook thorns of
cholla clumps falling over greasewood
brush trumpeting his calls for the seno-
rita through his hands intent only on
covering as much ground as he could in
his blind search for the girl

  after an hour of useless effort he be-
gan to take a more reasonable view of
the situation the girl if her inten-
tions were honest should have been
looking for him she had her sight and
finding him would not have been diffi-
cult with the air cleared of flying
dust one could see for miles on the
desert

  used to that country as she professed
to be it was not possible that she had
got up and wandered away in the storm
it was not as severe a sandstorm as
others seward had experienced people
had died in sandstorms but not in one
that had worn itself out so quickly the
senorita must have escaped and have
taken the burro with her

  it was now high time for seward to
think of himself he was perishing for
water and if he could not find sandy
and the canteens he must somehow
manage to return to the spring by the
hogback the slight ruffle of air from
the north still served him as a guide
moistening his fingers on his hot tongue
he lifted a hand to catch the direction
of the moving air then he proceeded
on his course
east of sunrise



  he was staggering before he had
gone far he dropped to the ground
and groped about until he had found
a small pebble and placed the stone un-
der his tongue that was something
of a help to a man far gone with thirst
but it was not much lifting himself
he continued to stagger onward

  he blundered into a stroke of luck
when he bumped into some object and
putting out a hand he encountered a
furry neck a nose was pushed against
his arm nuzzling him companionably

  sandy he gasped and then out
of pure relief he gave vent to a husky
laugh youre sandy all right sandy
from nose to heels old top

  he groped for the canteen of water
but it was gone and then for the sad-
dlebags and found them they chinked
as he struck them with the flat of his
hand

  what did this mean had the seno-
rita taken the canteen and started alone
across the desert why had she left
the saddlebags were they too heavy
for her to carry

  for a blind man seward muttered
all that is past finding out agua
sandy he called hoarsely to the burro
back to the camp sandy if you are
as dry as i am you will make for the
nearest water and thats the spring by
the hogback

  he started the burro letting him take
his own course and followed at his side
clinging to the packsaddle presently
he climbed to the burros neck and dis-
mounted only when he sensed that they
had reached a rise and were ascending
a slope

  the hogback good boy sandy
he croaked before many minutes
now well have water

  having gained the top they crossed
the flat crest and began a descent of the
opposite bank sandy was making
straight for water and presently at
the foot of the incline the burro quick-
ened his pace for a dozen yards halted

abruptly and lowered his head seward
could hear him splashing his nose in the
pool below the spring

  at last seward muttered and
guided by the drip of water made his
way to the spring threw himself down
at full length and drank

  he was back at his camp again
blind though he was he was safe for
the present he could use food from
his cache and that with the water
would keep life in him staying there
until his sight was restored would not
be a difficult matter awkward it was
true but he had passed through more
difficult experiences and had survived
im lucky after all he thought

chapter vi

the whip hand

returning to the pool just below

the little basin that caught the drip
of the spring seward laid aside his coat
and hat unbuckled his holster harness
and laid the gun on his coat then un-
buttoned his shirt at the neck rolled
up his sleeves and plunged his head into
the water

  his hair was caked with sand and
his face was grimy with it all his
weariness seemed to drop from him
with that refreshing dip now if the
black curtain would only lift from be-
fore his eyes if he could only see
nevertheless he still considered him-
self in luck and he laughed softly as
he shook the water out of his hair and
dried his face on a bandanna handker-
chief

  he had ceased to worry about the
senorita she was a designing person
and she had taken the canteen and had
abandoned him to his fate in the desert
and she must have ijnown that he was
blind as she skulked away while the
sandstorm was blowing itself out just
what her designs were was a puzzling
question but she had missed the gold
if the bandidos were her confeder-

ates then undoubtedly they had picked
her up very likely they had been keep-
ing track of her from the hills all the
while she was in his camp and after-
ward during that futile start for the
pass

  being well rid of her he thought was
a cause for congratulation he was
smiling to himself as he reached grop-
ingly for his six-gun his coat and his
hat his hands failed to find what they
were searching for and in a flash he
realized that his luck was not all that
he had believed it to be hat coat and
gun had vanished and as that fact
came home to him he sensed the pres-
ence of some one else in the camp it
might be the girl or the bandidos or
all of them ah if he could have looked
around he would have given a year
of his life for one minutes use of his
eyes

  sewards ability to think quickly in
a pinch had many a time stood him in
good stead during his desert experi-
ences he made ue of it now and ad-
justed himself to the evil circumstances
as best he could

  where in blazes did i put that gun
he said aloud trying to make it appear
that he did not suspect the presence of
unseen thieving hands oh well he
added rising ill find it later

  placing his fingers to his lips he gave
vent to a shrill whistle sandy an-
swered the call drew close and pushed
his nose against his masters shoulder
seward removed the heavy saddlebags
from the burros back and carried them
into the encircling chaparral he bent
down under the mesquite dipped a hand
into his trousers pocket with all the
eye-defying swiftness of a conjuror
and pushed the saddlebags out of sight
in the bushes from under the buckled
flap of one of the bags glimmered in
plain view the half of a twenty-dollar
gold piece seward lifted himself
paused a moment to get his bearings
and then returned to the burro

  now sandy he remarked what-
ever happens that gold is safe ill
strip the pack gear from your back and
well both try and take our comfort
before he could begin there was a
stir behind him and another voice broke
the silence

  jest a minute seward jest a min-
ute i reckon yu thought yu was alone
here huh well it aint that way at
all yu see old-timer im around
seward was not startled by the sound
of the voice although he sprang to an
about-face and pretended to be what
really surprised him was the fact that
the voice had a familiar ring

  good he exclaimed its a com-
fort to have somebody around just now
who are you 

  a throaty chuckle prefaced the an-
swer yore old friend red gallo-
way seward cant yu see at all
amigo 

  seward shook his head sun-blind
galloway he answered it came on
me during the sandstorm how is it
that you happen to be here

  jest a chance seward i was
ketched in that flurry o dust and my
caballo got away from me that hoss
is on his way to cerillos by now i ex-
pect thats where i got him from and
whenever he breaks away or i give him
his head he lays a bee line fer his old
stampin ground im feelin tollable
good over this myself i didnt allow
yu was the sort that ever had any hard
luck same as bein sun-blind ac-
cordin to the stories about yu thats
bein passed around yure bulletproof
and hard-luckproof nothin to it is
the

  no galloway returned seward
theres nothing to it wheres your
pardner eph springer

  him and me has cut adrift seward
we was to meet at dead mule flat but
im changin my mind about that i
reckon ill cut loose from eph for
keeps by goin through the pass east
east of sunrise



o sunrise canon ill be within two
days hikin of sonora with the five
thousand in gold in them saddlebags i
reckon i can do right well acrost the
line one spell eph and me made a
dead set at that gold but yu called the
turn on us ever since then eph and
me has been yore little dog fido walk-
in lame rollin over and playin dead
whenever yu crooked yore finger or
cracked the whip them times se-
ward yu could see but now bein
blind it makes a heap o difference
dont yu allow it does

  there was a quick sound of feet and
seward felt a stinging blow across his
face he struck out with his fist but
the blow spent itself on space there
came the throaty chuckle again

  yu was hittin south seward
taunted the voice and im here to the
north ill admit i was scairt o yu
one spell but bein blind that a way sort
o pulls yore fangs i lost my hat dur-
in the sandstorm but now i got yoren
got yore coat too and that six-gun
with the neat little holster harness
thatll come handy i expect down
there in sonora i aint never cornin
back this side the line any more if yu
ever meet up with eph jest tell him
i said good-by tell him i had a chance
to make off with the five thousand
pesos and that i made the most of it
him and me has about played out
around these parts grubstakin suckers
aint so plenty and the old game has
got so slow were apt to starve to death
jest excuse me a minute seward while
i get the gold

  you cant take that gold galloway
cried seward

  there was another quick movement
another blow another throaty chuckle
seward put up a hand to his face and
he could feel the warm tickle of red
that rilled across his cheek from the
broken skin

  shore gibed galloway im yore
right good friend seward nothin on

earth i wouldnt do fer yu and aint i
provin it if some o these old alkalis
could see yu now ill bet theyd change
their minds about yure bein ten feet
high and wearin horns i can pound
yu around all i blame please and it
aint in yu to put the double-cross on
me and dont lie about my not bein
able to take the gold i seen where yu
put them saddlebags yu four-flusher
and i heard the bags clink as yu toted
em wait a minute

  there followed a sound of scrambling
in the chaparral under the little
smudge of red a grim smile worked its
way over sewards face as he stood and
waited there was another crashing of
brush a fall of heavy feet in the sand
and this time a dull chinking noise

  didnt get the gold huh jubilated
galloway why seward one o them
double-eagles had spilled out from un-
der the flap o the saddlebags im tak-
in the burro too and makin the bags
fast to the pack saddle the saddle-
bags rattled as he maeuvered with them
so fur so good he mumbled there
aint much moren half yore pack on
the burro seward heres grub but
no canteens wheres the canteens
im askin yu right friendly seward
about them canteens i dont want to
strike out fer sonora without a water
supply

  the small one is lost galloway
replied seward youll find the big one
in the brush to the east of the spring

  losin yore nerve aint yu  jeered
galloway yu know when somebody
has got the whip hand of yu dont yu 
now ill fill that big canteen if i can
find it where yu say it is and ill be
on my way somebody is liable to come
huntin yu and im going to make my-
self scarce muy pronto

  seward sat down in the sand hunched
up his knees in front of him and
clasped his hands about them he
could hear galloway splashing in the
water as he filled the canteen then gal-

loway returned to the burro and secured
the canteen to the packsaddle

  now he went on i allow im
fixed till i cross the border after that
ill get along fine i ort to be able to
loaf two or three years down among
the greasers on five thousand pesos

  let me tell you something before
you go galloway said seward

  spit it out old-timer i aint got
much time to spare if i get through the
pass and to the water hole beyond come
night whats on yore mind

  just this seward went on coolly
dispassionately ill have my sight
again in a few days and then ill be
after you ill have you galloway if
i have to chase you from mexico to
central america down through panama
and clear to cape horn youve got
my gun and you could kill me with it
but you are yellow clear through and
havent the nerve the only way you
can save your red scalp is by leaving
those saddlebags the burro and the
rest of the plunder you can take the
canteen if you want to go but youll
do better by yourself if you show good
sense stay here and lend me a helping
hand make your choice and make it
now

  the old look of fear rose in gallo-
ways face seward had been his
nemesis and his orders were backed
with an appalling reputation to evil-
doers for making good his threats for
a moment it seemed as though gallo-
ways nerve would fail him he
dropped back against the burro strik-
ing the saddlebags with one extended
arm as he did so

  the clinking sound that followed
focused his greed for gold upon his
shrinking courage he took heart
there had come to him by the spring
near the hogback one chance in a mil-
lion to make a big stake seward was
blind and helpless suppose with sight
returned he did trail him  sonora was
wide and filled with hiding places and

galloway was adept at keeping himself
out of sight

  all right yelled galloway im
makin my choice how dyu like it
again he struck at seward but se-
ward sensing what was coming threw
himself backward and galloways big
fist cleaved the air as seward rolled
to get out of the way galloway jumped
on him with crushing force seward
caught at the two feet on his chest
but galloway kicked himself clear

  trail me shouted the grubber de-
fiantly find me if yu can mebby
ill have some greaser boys handy at
my back and well give yu moreji a
handful

  there came the dull thud of a kick
followed by a wheezy groan from
sandy

  get down there to the water yu
imp o the devil roared galloway and
take yore last drink this side o the
water hole tother side the pass
seward groped over the ground for
a rock but he could find none a few
minutes later while he was crawling
toward the spring in the hope of en-
countering galloway and coming to
grips with him he heard the padded
fall of hoofs on the slope of the hog-
back from above floated the raucous
voice of galloway

  adios seward of sacatone yure
some man with yore eyes in workin
order but yu couldnt even side-step a
sidewinder the way yare now drop
in on me over in sonora the latch-
string is out fer yu any old time
galloway answered seward you
dont know what youre up against

chapter vii

to the rescue

in the back room at simms  nor-
cross eph springer had told his
story of treachery and vengeance to
ethel and simms id like to get a
grubstake out o this finished spring-
east of sunrise



er noting with satisfaction the sensa-
tion his story had caused im gettin
in wrong with chombo and hes a hard
case what ive told yu ort to be
worth a good grubstake hadnt it now 
the girls face was white she had
clenched her hands convulsively and
was staring into space with fear-filled
eyes

  i wouldnt take it so hard ethel
said simms this man may be lying
just to wheedle us out of some sup-
plies

  is it true eph springer the girl
demanded

  s help me maam every word is
gospel declared springer dyu
reckon he went on appealing to
simms that id come here with a lie
like that aginst chombo  all the grub-
stakes in the world wouldnt be worth
the risk im tryin to help seward
ethel was apparently convinced that
the information was reliable weve
got to do something for mr seward
mr simms she declared and with-
out loss of time if he hadnt been try-
ing to help you and father by taking
that gold to los cerillos he wouldnt
have fallen into this trap we must get
a car and hurry over the hermosito
trail to the pass east of sunrise canon
cant you see she cried wildly that
its the only thing to be done

  it would be dark before we could
make the trip said simms and we
couldnt find seward after sundown it
will probably be hard enough to find
him in broad day hell be prospecting
through the hills as he works his way
south

  at any rate insisted the girl we
can go to this pass we must get there
as soon as we can and wait for him
and warn him ill go alone if thats
the only way

  you are excited ethel simms told
her gently  and this is a case where we
must remain calm and do some cool
thinking a wrong move just now

would be worse than making no move
at all go over to the jail and ask jerry
blake to come here

  no broke in springer apprehen-
sively if yure goin to get blake in
on this right heres where i duck

  he jumped from his chair and would
have bolted for the door had not simms
caught up a rifle leaning in one corner
of the room

  you sit down he ordered if
youre giving us a square deal you cant
object to talking with the sheriff and
telling him exactly what you have told
us get back in that chair

  springer dropped into his seat id
never a come here he complained if
id knowed i was to be jumped on like
this only tryin to do somethin fer
seward-and mebby clear up a grub-
stake

  youll get one of the biggest grub-
stakes you ever had springer if we
find we can depend on what youve told
us said simms but if we find youre
lying therell be something else coming
to you

  fortunately the sheriff was in his of-
fice and ethel brought him at once he
tossed a grim look at springer as he
came into the back room and pulled up
a chair

  now then grubber he remarked
you use a straight tongue in talking
with me i know more than you think
about the operations you and red gallo-
way have been putting across and i
wont stand side-stepping from you
whats this about chombo and lola
sanger and walt seward

  if i give yu facts blake yu wont
make me any trouble  faltered spring-
er

  no but ill make you a lot if you
dont go ahead with it

  springer repeated the story he had
already told ethel and simms-how
lola sanger and chombo had started
on two fast horses for the pass east of
sunrise canon to lay an ambush for


top-notch magazine

seward and how la joya from forty-
mile was to delay seward on his way
until the ambush was in readiness

  blake sat back in his chair lowered
his brows and tossed a glance at the
girl i thought you were keeping se-
wards work with that money a close
secret he remarked

  we are jerry put in simms
norcross ethel and i havent told a
soul

  then how did lola sanger get hold
of it

  wait spoke up ethel i have a
suspicion about that and well see how
close it is to the truth

  she left the room and could be heard
climbing up the outside stairs pres-
ently she returned bringing with her
francisca a maricopa girl who helped
her with the housework francisca was
a stolid person and did not seem in the
least awed by the sheriff or by any
business that might be afoot

  francisca was in the kitchen mr
blake ethel explained while i was
talking with mr seward in the front
room upstairs and asking him if he
would take the money to los cerillos
it just occurred to me that she had
overheard the conversation and had told
of our plans to others did you fran-
cisca she asked

  the maricopa girl nodded si she
answered evidently with no desire to
hold anything back

  oh you did said blake how
many did you tell francisca

  the girl held up a stubby brown fin-
ger uno she answered

  only one who was that -

  la joya of forty-mile

  here was evidence to bolster up
springers report and everybody was
interested

  where did you see la joya went
on the sheriff

  she come to door when miss ethel
was downstairs she ask tout seward
who had just left she give me cinco

pesos-five stubby fingers were lifted
-and i tell her bout seward taking
the gold

  there you have it observed blake
to the others five dollars is a lot of
money to a girl like francisca it ap-
pears from what springer says that
lola sanger has been staying at the
posada at forty-mile since she and dirk
made their get-away from the jail la
joya hid her away there i suppose
the jewel rode back told the news to
that tiger cat lola and she made up
her mind that shed be revenged on
seward for the second capture of her
brother she rang in chombo that
half-breed is an enemy of sewards and
a friend of the two sangers im in-
clined to think from the indications
that springer has told the truth just
to be on the safe side though he add-
ed im going to lock him up until i
sift this thing and make sure his story is
o k

  a wail went up from springer and
thats what i get fer tryin to do the
right thing he growled im to be
locked up i wish to thunder id stayed
away from tres alamos and let seward
take his medicine

  youll be treated like a white man
springer maybe for the first time in
your worthless life said blake reas-
suringly if your information pans
out

  what will you do mr blake
asked ethel anxiously

  by sunup to-morrow was the an-
swer ill hit the hermosito trail for
the pass east of sunrise canon in order
to head off seward joe reeves my
best deputy will go with me maybe
we can make a good haul and bring in
lola sanger and chombo and then pick
up the jewel at forty-mile

  but why not go to-night de-
manded ethel

  wed be apt to miss some bets
ethel if we tried to do anything to-
night its too late for a start
east of sunrise



  but already la joya may have met
mr seward and--

  havent you learned enough about
walt seward to know that la joya
wont be able to fool him for a minute
ill gamble that if we never stirred a
hand in this thing seward would come
out of it as he comes out of everything
else-top hole im not worried about
seward and this fool talk of an ambush
at the pass im all set to recapture
lola sanger it was supposed she had
left the country but im going to show
her that she was foolish for stickin
around this is too good a chance to
miss

  anyways put in spx-inger seward
will be tipped off afore he can tumble
into any trouble at the pass hes goin
to have plenty o warnin

  how asked ethel eagerly in
what way

  my pardner red galloway started
out the hermosito trail to find seward
at the same time i rode in here i was
aimin to head him off with that money
if he hadnt got started

  i wouldnt trust either you or red
galloway as far as i could throw a steer
by the tail said the sheriff youre
both of you bad medicine youre play-
ing this little game straight looks like
just for what you can get out of it
maybe galloway will find seward and
tip him off about chombo and maybe
he wont if he does then thats some-
thing on the right side of galloways
account and ill not forget it if he
doesnt-well i wont forget that
either come along springer and well
stroll over to the jail

  what time do you intend to start in
the morning mr blake queried
ethel

  oh about sunup it wont take us
long to cover the ground in the flivver
im going with you the girl de-
clared

  blake shook his head no ethel
he told her its going to be a rough

trip joes a fast driver and hell hit
all the bumps on high and theres
plenty of bumps believe me

  you think ill be in the way ex-
claimed ethel

  you in the way blake laughed
and patted her shoulder why you
stood in that door there and took a
shot at dirk sanger with a rifle when
he was forcing simms to open the safe
and get out that five thousand dollars
in gold if you get tired clerking in
the store come over to my office and ill
swear you in as a two-gun deputy
mentioning the gold started the sher-
iff on another tack ill be glad when
those double eagles are transferred to
los cerillos they have made me more
trouble first and last than any other
gold that was ever minted i suppose
you want to drive with us to-morrow
to make sure theyre delivered to this
man sparling

  that gold mr blake the girl an-
swered is the least of my worries im
afraid for mr seward

  the sheriff gave her a quick look
and there was something in his eyes
that brought a vivid color into her
cheeks he laid a fatherly hand on her
arm you havent known seward as
long as i have ethel he told her
gravely and you dont understand how
thoroughly capable he is of taking care
of himself there was a time not so
very long ago when something hap-
pened to him that caused me to worry
a lot but when the returns were all in
i found that i had been making a fool
of myself seward doesnt thank any
one for worrying about him but ill
tell you ethel if it will ease your mind
any and your father is willing you can
ride south with reeves and me to-
morrow

  thank you mr blake returned
ethel gratefully i know father will
let me go and i shall be ready by the
time you and mr reeves are ill send
a good supper over to the jail for eph


top-notch magazine

springer for im sure he is trying to
do what is right

  the next morning disappointment
awaited ethel the weatherwise sher-
iff reading the storm warnings refused
to start until after the sandstorm which
he was almost certain was coming but
directly after tres alamos had opened
its doors and windows and was enjoying
a little relief from the sweltering heat
the official car pulled out of town with
reeves on the front seat blake beside
him and ethel in the tonneau

chapter viii

in the gathering gloom

in all the seward of sacatone stories
told and retold between the mogollon
mesa and the mexican border there is
none in which the incidents so interlock
in drama and tragedy as in this one

  in the early afternoon following the
brief sandstorm seward blind was
robbed of his burro saddlebags and
much of his equipment and left helpless
at the spring by the slope of the hog-
back blake and reeves with ethel
norcross were leaving town in a fast
motor car hoping to rescue seward and
to effect the capture of at least three
black conspirators lola sanger and
chombo the bowman had hastened
southward along the hermosito trail
late on the preceding afternoon passing
a mile to the east of the hogback where
seward and the rescued la joya were
having their frugal supper in sewards
camp had reached the pass east of sun-
rise canon during the night had gone
into hiding had weathered the simoon
and were now eagerly awaiting the com-
ing of seward the designing la joya
as it appeared later had been picked up
in the desert as the sandstorm was
blowing itself out and had returned to
forty-mile with the three riders who
had helped her stage the little play of
beguiling treachery and red gallo-
way-

  every rogue in carrying out his law-
less plans is bound to come upon some
complication in which he will overreach
himself this lapse in craftiness is not
always attended with serious results
but the brutal and treacherous grubber
was playing a game the danger of which
was beyond his ability to foresee and
guard against perhaps his wits were
still befogged by the tiswin or perhaps
even without the tiswin they would not
have been keen enough to cope with the
situation be that as it might however
he was pushing southward as fast as
possible driving sewards burro before
him and wearing sewards hat and coat

  behind the bales of hay in chombos
shed galloway and springer had over-
heard all the red-handed treachery
plotted by the half-breed and the venge-
ful sister of dirk sanger galloway
knew that the master bowman would be
waiting for seward under cover in the
pass that the way to los cerillos and
sonora was through the pass that
sandy the burro was known every-
where to be sewards pack animal and
trifling in itself but of utmost impor-
tance in fates general scheme of re-
prisal galloway was wearing sewards
hat and coat

  did galloways thoughts however
discover anything of personal peril in
all this no he could not draw out
his imagination so fine as he kicked
and pounded the burro along and lis-
tened to the occasional chinking in the
saddlebags there was nothing but exul-
tation in his lawless heart now and
again he would draw from his pocket
a twenty-dollar gold piece and stare at
it with greedy eyes there were two
hundred and forty-nine more of them
in the saddlebags-so ran his specula-
tions-and how he would lord it over
the greasers of sonora with all that
wealth

  he would draw about him a gang as
ambitious for plunder as himself and in
some fastness of the sonora mounatins
east of sunrise



he would take life easy and merely di-
rect the forays of his followers if
seward came searching for him-as un-
doubtedly he would if he did not die of
hunger there by the hogback-galloway
would have some desperate men for his
own protection it was a most entranc-
ing picture for a desert hobo of gallo-
ways type

  the sun was setting as galloway
drove sandy into the pass the flaming
red hair under the brim of sewards
hat was darkened by the shadows cast
by the rocky walls rising on each side
of the fleeing grubber

  and theres eph galloway was
muttering he can wait fer me till the
crack o doom on dead mule flat im
done with him hes too slow and too
keerful anyways id a turned on
seward long ago if it hadnt been fer
eph i wish to thunder eph could
know how easy seward was when i
finally made a set at him

  remembering the blows he had rained
on the blind seward and then how se-
ward had fought back like a shadow
boxer galloway gave his throaty
chuckle and finished it with a low laugh

  that laugh over his successful treach-
ery was still on his lips when a bow-
string twanged a hundred yards on the
right from a brush clump flew a
feathered dart its head gleaming a little
in the faint light galloway halted in
his tracks an expression of weird
astonishment on his heavy face gone
for him was every hope of an easy law-
less life in sonora he crumpled
slowly where he stood both hands
clutching at a long slim shaft clinging
to his chest dropping forward he
sprawled on his face his limbs twitched
convulsively a last sibilant whisper es-
caped his lips and he lay still

  the brush parted and chombo step-
ping softly in his moccasined feet
emerged into view coolly he paused
and began unstringing his bow about
his forehead holding his long black hair

in place was a red headband a glim-
mer of satisfaction shone in his cruel
little eyes

  despachemonos sefiorita he called
as calmly as though he had just planted
an arrow in the gold of a straw target
get the double eagles and we will be
traveling your hermanos score is
settled and me i have settled mine
get the double eagles and we will ride

  lola sanger her face white as death
led two horses clear of the scrub farther
along the pass she trailed the reins on
the ground and wavered a little as she
left the horses and approached the
burro sandy had suffered such brutal
treatment during the last few hours that
he was restive suspicious of every one
he tried to break away but the excited
girl overtook him and halted him with
trembling hands she unbuckled one side
of the saddlebags reached into it and
drew forth-a handful of iron disks

  a startled cry escaped her lips fran-
tically she continued her search there
was no gold-only those big iron wash-
ers that had somewhat the shape of the
gold pieces and something of their
chinking music as they were shaken in
the bags

  bicn y quc came a voice behind
her

  it was the voice of chombo but the
tone of it was new to lola sanger the
face of chombo was new to her too
black and stormy under the red head-
band ominous in the shifting shadows
of the pass he was cleaning an ar-
rowhead on a bit of brush wiping it
carefully for the bowman counted his
arrows among his treasures

  there is no gold here chombo
cried the girl nothing but these
and she held up some of the iron disks
seward he has fooled us

  oiga but he is clever the words
came with a snarl through the half-
breeds thin lips i have wasted an
arrow senorita his eyes flamed
that is sewards burro back there-


top-notch magazine

he motioned behind him-is sewards
sombrero his coat but not seward at
all no not seward i have been
fooled

  what whispered the girl

  go and look

  no lola sanger shivered who
is it chombo if not seward of saca-
tone

  chombo reached out his hand caught
her roughly by the arm dragged her
back along the pass you not like to
look eh he sneered at her you not
got much courage now when all is
done you very fine schemer senorita
but here your scheme go wrong and
you make a fool out of me there
they halted beside the still form
red galloway whispered the
trembling girl

si and iow he come to have se-
wards burro his sombrero his coat
i cant understand this chombo i
tell you i am as amazed at this as you
are

  chombo shrugged his shoulders
seward too much for us he growled
too much for everybody you stay
here bymby i come back

  he hoisted the bulky form in the road
to his shoulders and staggered off with
it with horror growing in her eyes
lola sanger watched him climb the
slope of the pass a ghoulish figure in
the fading daylight at last he van-
ished with his gruesome burden and it
was ten minutes before he returned

  old prospect hole he announced
briefly red galloway heap better off
there-heap better for me than out here
in the trail as for you and he whirled
on the girl like a rabid wolf you got
me in this trouble me i no sabe what
you got at the back of your head now
you walk back to forty-mile le deseo
un buen vicije

  chombo whirled away and ran for
the horses

  the girl followed him screaming
you cant leave me here chombo

you were my brothers friend you
cant desert me in these waterless hills
like this with the night coming on

  he swung to the back of one of the
horses his face set with stony deter-
mination the flash of a relentless pur-
pose in his eyes he was all yaqui now
enraged by the thought that somehow
he had been double crossed and that the
girl must have had a hand in it

  chombo the cry was a shriek
and two hands clasped convulsively at
his stirrup chonjjx-

  he struck his horse with the spurs
and the animal leaped away the other
horse led by the bridle reins likewise
jumped forward along the trail the
girl was dragged for a few yards and
then fell to the ground rising to her
knees and sobbing hysterically she
watched chombo fade from sight in the
gathering gloom

  she got up and ran after him call-
ing wildly for him to come back and
then reaching the spot where red gal-
loway had fallen she halted in a sudden
hysterical fear turning she ran south-
ward along the pass until she was
breathless and staggered to a boulder
she crouched beside the stone fighting
against her superstitious fears

  by degrees she got her emotions un-
der control it was necessary situated
as she was to think and to think to some
purpose she had lost her hat some-
where and she pulled a shawl that lay
across her shoulders over her head
what was she to do

  she thought of the burro she could
ride the burro if she could find him
perhaps if she gave him his head he
would carry her to water-possibly into
los cerillos she knew little about that
country but there was a trail to cerillos
and she could follow it anything was
better than staying in that pass spend-
ing the night there and waiting for
some traveler to come along who could
give her a lift

  she wandered back and forth for
east of sunrise



nearly an hour but the burro was no-
where to be found even that dumb
brute had fled from her she told her-
self as from something evil

  then abruptly two streaming lights
blazed through the pass her heart
leaped as the two red eyes glowed in
the dark halted perhaps a hundred feet
away and remained at rest a car
she started toward it keeping to the
bushes at the trailside when she had
come close she heard a voice

  you look on that side joe and ill
see what i can find over here on the
left too bad we had all that engine
trouble and couldnt make the pass be-
fore sundown but well do the best we
can

  lola sanger caught her breath the
voice was familiar she knew that blake
the sheriff from tres alamos was
there and that he was looking for some
one this was the last straw the last
drop in her cup of misfortune but she
would rather die in the waterless hills
than be taken by blake

  she crept away southward along the
pass skulking through the brush mak-
ing as little noise as she could look-
ing backward she saw flash lights
twinkling in the chaparral on and on
she hurried until worn out and ex-
hausted she crawled up the stony bank
to a ledge crouched behind some stones
and waited breathlessly

  later in half an hour it may have
been the gleaming headlights swept on
down the pass and the car disappeared
in the direction of los cerillos

chapter ix

the ray of hope

dobbed of his burro the saddlebags
 and some of his supplies and left
by galloway to get along as best he
could seward went hunting for the
cache where he had concealed the rest
of his equipment he was half an hour
finding the pile of stones he knew

that camp and its surroundings as he
knew his two hands but groping his
way to any particular point other than
the spring was a difficult feat

   the drip of water where it oozed
from the rocks and rilled into the little
basin below was the one constant sound
by which he guided all his sightless
maneuvers he could always get his
bearings when he stopped to listen to
that musical drip drip drip at the
spring

   in the cache were his first-aid kit a
 side of bacon two or three tins of sar-
 dines his fire jack and cooking utensils
 and his short-handled pick shovel ham-
 mer and gold pan it had been neces-
 sary to lighten sandys pack in order
 to make it possible for la joya to ride
 the burro with some small degree of
 comfort the box of ointment with
 which he treated his eyes was in the
 pocket of the coat stolen by galloway
 sewards dirk knife was also in the
 coat

   all he could do for his eyes was to
bandage them with gauze and if he had
thought himself equal to starting a fire
and frying the bacon there was no way
of slicing it he crushed one of the
tins of sardines between two stones and
managed to get at the contents it was
a slim meal but enough

   his tobacco cigarette papers and
matches were in the pockets of his
khaki shirt hunting the shade of the
dusty mesquite bushes he spread out
the tarpaulin rolled himself a smoke
and tried to forget the aches and pains
caused by galloways fists and feet

   im tough as a piece of rawhide
he told himself and its a mighty good
thing the situation could be a whole
lot worse than it is

  that was always the way in which
seward faced his reverses there was
a satisfaction in knowing that ebbing
fortune had stopped short of rock bot-
tom he was thankful for his strength
for his ability to endure

  and galloway he reasoned grimly
might have cut short my career with
a bullet from my own gun but i knew
he hadnt the nerve to go that far
im sorry for sandy thats all

  burros ears are said to be long to
catch curses but sandys ears had yet
to catch the first curse from seward
in all his five years of coming and go-
ing about the deserts sandy had been
cared for and treated as a faithful
friend and the burro in his brute
way showed his gratitude for kindly
treatment a whistle from seward al-
ways brought him yes seward was
deeply sorry for sandy in fact he was
fretting more on sandys account than
on his own he could get out of his
troubles but the burro would suffer
every kind of brutality if he ever
reached sonora with the hard-hearted
galloway

   east of sunrise falls the night 
seward murmured as he smoked im
beginning to understand now what that
hunch meant for me my night is pretty
complete for the present he smiled
a bit at the fancy ill be here for two
or three days i suppose before that
black curtain lifts he went on musing-
ly and ill be down to raw bacon be-
fore then oh well even that might
be worse

  having finished his cigarette he lay
back on the tarp and was soon asleep
how long he slept he could not know
but he was aroused suddenly by a
thumping of hoofs in the sand lifting
himself on one elbow he listened in-
tently what was this was la joya
returning with the bandidos to look
for the gold

  this thought gave seward a good
deal of concern until at last he had re-
solved the hoofbeats into those of a
single horse they passed very close to
him so close that a rider could scarcely
have failed to see him but they went
on with a rustle of mesquite branches
until they halted near the drip drip

drip of the spring there followed a
sound of disturbed water

  a riderless horse i seward rea-
soned getting off the tarpaulin with
sudden hope rushing through him
that wotdd be luck if it were true
but it seems too good to be true he
finished

  he moved forward toward the
spring guided by the splashing in the
pool at last he put out his hand and
it rested on a bony back but only for
a moment at the first touch of his
fingers the horse snorted threw up his
head and would have shied off had not
seward made a haphazard grab for the
animals head the reins were trailing
and by luck seward caught one of them

  steady sport steady i he coaxed
im not going to hurt you

   with a tight hold on the rein he pro-
ceeded to make further investigations
the horse was lean and shaggy the
empty saddle on his back was a dilapi-
dated affair with one oxbow stirrup on
the right and no stirrup at all on the
left a small canteen hung from the
saddle horn and a little bag was tied at
the cantle bringing the reins together
and tying them seward thrust his arm
through the loop and removed the can-
teen unscrewing the top an odor of
tiswin was immediately in evidence he
untied the bag and found it to contain
about half a pound of bacon-all that
remained of the slab

  then seward had a most engaging
thought could this by some stroke of
remarkable luck be the horse that red
galloway had lost in the sandstorm
was this the animal that had been
foaled in los cerillos the one that al-
ways made for that camp whenever he
could break away from his ownei 

  jumping sandhills exclaimed se-
ward just think what that would
mean

   it was a plausible theory the horse
on his way to cerillos would turn aside
from his course and hunt for water it
east of sunrise



might tie that he had been at that spring
before and that the remembrance of it
was still fresh in his brute mind if he
was really galloways horse he prob-
ably knew all the springs and water
holes of that desert country

  the idea electrified seward he saw
an opportunity blind though he was
for getting on to los cerillos

  maybe you can turn the trick for
me old top he said jovially stroking
the shaggy neck of the animal but
youre tired and well wait till evening
then in the cool of the night well try
a little experiment ill mount let you
go as you please and see if we fetch up
in cerillos

  his pack rope was at the cache he
got it after a deal of troublesome
searching looped it about the horses
neck and made the free end fast to a
stout paloverde then he removed the
bridle and saddle and listened to the
animals contented grunts as he rolled
in the sand

  emptying the canteen of the small
amount of liquor that remained in it he
took it to the spring rinsed it out and
filled it with fresh water if the horse
really belonged to galloway then here
was something to explain the grubbers
vicious attack

  dutch courage commented seward

  when the air began to cool he knew
that day was drawing to a close as the
coolness intensified he knew that the big
clear-cut arizona stars were spangling
the blue-black sky i think we can
start now he decided and went about
his preparations

  first he got the riding gear back on
the horse but left the animal tethered
by the rope while he made a search in
the chaparral he knew what he wanted
but had difficulty in finding it half a
dozen times he dug with his hands at
the roots of as many scraggly iron-
woods and then at the seventh effort
he found a heavily weighted canvas bag
the contents of it clinked cheerily as he

lifted it out of the hole he laughed
softly

  anyhow he murmured this is
something that trouble-hunch did for
me the saddlebags were of the same
weight and they rattled almost as music-
ally as this bag does that gold piece
slipping out from under the flap was
the only thing that kept galloway from
making a more thorough examination
even a blind man is able to do a
thing or two if he sets his mind to
it

  he hung the canteen around the sad-
dle horn tied the bag securely to the
cantle with a few feet of the pack rope
and left the rest of the rope dangling
in a coil then he swung into the old
saddle

  now sport he said to the horse as
he dropped the tied reins on the saddle
horn take your own course and take
your own time the night is cool and
pleasant and we can go far ill stay in
the saddle to the end of the ride-and
hope for the best

  he heard galloping hoofs in the trail
to the east but could not determine
whether they were going north or south
they faded into silence through a night
that was clear as a bell chombo was
riding for his ranch with the led horse
and it was well for seward that he did
not encounter the half-breed on the
hermosito trail

  sewards mount moved aimlessly
about for a few minutes evidently won-
dering why his rider gave no hint of
the direction to be traveled by a push
of the knee or a pull at the bits then he
began an ascent which seward knew to
be the slope of the hogback

  good he exclaimed were get-
ting a beautiful start in the right direc-
tion

  the flat crest of the uplift was
crossed and the descent made on the
other side by taking an angling course
the horse would come into the her-
mosito trail but whether he was taking


top-notch magazine

that course or not seward could not
know

  it was a long ride and doubly long
for a man who was unable to see or to
have any definite idea of the course he
was traveling all seward knew was
that they had started right when they
crossed the hogback

  he was pinning his hopes on the
chance remark of galloways that the
horse galloway had lost was so fond of
los cerillos that he headed for the
camp whenever he got the chance it
was a forlorn hope but forlorn hopes
have often been realized

  perhaps it was three hours later-
three hours according to sewards guess
at the passing time-when the horse be-
gan climbing again

  this reflected seward may be
the approach to the pass east of sunrise
canon

  a few minutes more and he was sure
of it for the horses hoofs echoed in a
way that suggested high banks to left
and right a quarter of an hour later
the echoes ceased and there was another
descent the horse struck into a slow
lope and there was an air of certainty
about his movements that was most
promising and then abruptly the
horse halted flung backward with a
frightened snort and refused to move
farther

  whats the matter now sport in-
quired seward a ditch across the
road or some other kind of a barrier

  the animal dropped his head and be-
gan sniffing as at some object in front
of him seward slid stiffly from the
saddle the looped reins over his arm
and bent down with one groping hand
extended his fingers twined them-
selves in long soft tresses

  good lord he gasped its a
woman

  a shawllike garment was about the
womans shoulders and her head was
bare

  la joya he muttered amazed

can it be la joya he knelt down
and lifted the womans head in his arms
senorita he called

  there was no answer but the woman
was alive for her flesh was warm and
he could hear a faint sibilant breathing
he groped for the canteen uncapped it
and awkwardly pressed it to her lips
then he poured some of the water over
her face she heaved a long painful
sigh and began to stir

  help me she begged whoever
you are please help me i have sprained
my ankle and cant walk a step

  who are you he asked

  there fell a silence then seward
of sacatone the woman cried and
struggled to free herself from his sup-
porting arm

chapter x

a bit of strategy

qometimes a story of seward of
sacatone which deals with a series
of connected incidents will be broken
into fragments and each fragment will
be told and retold as complete in itself
and as having no bearing on other in-
cidents that made it plausible or pos-
sible

  perhaps this is not to be wondered
at for when a really remarkable figure
such as seward appears in a thinly set-
tled inhospitable country and plays dar-
ingly and successfully the role of a
righter of wrongs his deeds are sure
to become a popular topic in camps or
in the settlements and when an un-
selfish desire for service prompts the
deeds and no reward for their accom-
plishment is ever accepted save that of
an approving conscience the protagonist
inevitably achieves heroic stature he
is mute on the subject of his own per-
formances and the record must be re-
ceived from those whom he has helped
or from witnesses thus it is that frag-
ments are made to stand by themselves
as complete tales with no hint of their
east of sunrise



relation to events preceding or follow-
ing which would give to such fragments
their true value

  among the more ignorant and super-
stitious seward became a superman in-
fallible in judgment certain as fate in
all his activities and proof against all
the ills that flesh is heir to this type
of hero-worshipers scoffs at the story
of sewards temporary blindness and
asserts that he merely assumed such a
condition in order to develop facts which
were difficult of discovery in any other
way

  there was an opposing camp of se-
wards admirers a more intelligent and
logical faction which admitted the fact
of his blindness although sorely puzzled
to account for the affliction both sides
argue a pretty fair case from this
woman whom he found in the trail dur-
ing his night ride to cerillos

  nevertheless it is a truth that seward
was sun-blind and that alone makes of
an unusual adventure a most extraor-
dinary proof of his resourcefulness
properly to appraise the la joya inci-
dent it must be considered in connec-
tion with the other fragments that have
to do with lola sanger chombo and
red galloway

  the woman in the trail recognized
him cried out his name and tried to get
away she had not taken a step how-
ever before she fell moaning to the
ground

  then it is true said seward and
you are faquita gonzales the la joya
of forty-mile

  there followed another silence then
si came the answer followed by the
query in a faint voice what is the
matter senor seward why do you
grope like that with your hands
sun-blind senorita you know it
was coming on yesterday

  there was a murmured exclamation
i remember si i remember

  it is all right seward went on
and we will forget yesterday you

want to return to forty-mile well
i can take you as far as cerillos and
no doubt you have friends there

  i have friends there the other an-
swered eagerly just outside the town
on this trail but how will you take
me

  you can ride the horse and i will
walk how far are we from cerillos
do you know

  no i am not familiar with this
cross trail

  he helped her up then lifted her
bodily into the saddle but he kept the
reins in his own hands as he walked
beside the horse

  you remember what you told me at
the spring by the hogback seward
asked as they plodded along

  no i forget what happened seems
more like a dream than anything else
perhaps said seward i can re-
fresh your memory the bandidos
now as i understand it they were
your friends and not your enemies you
were merely pretending

  i am sorry senor yes i was only
pretending

  and when after the sandstorm red
galloway came and took the burro away
from us you thought you could find the
men you said were bandidos and you
went after them to get help for me
i tried hard senor but the walk was
more than i could bear i turned my
ankle while i was coming through the
pass but i so wanted to help you that
i kept on until i gave out completely
you were after the gold you know
but you decided that you wouldnt
take it

  no i-i couldnt take it

  you must remember the rattlesnake
you killed by the spring

  si i recall killing the rattlesnake
and you called those double eagles
phantom gold 

  well isnt that money phantom
gold it has caused much trouble
it caused dirk sanger a lot of trou-

ble he will go over the road on ac-
count of it-and some other things he
has done a scoundrel if there ever
was one

  sewards hand was on the saddle can-
tle and he felt a sudden tensing of the
girls body in the saddle the slow
grim smile that twitched at his lips was
hidden by the darkness the girl mut-
tered something indistinctly but made
no other answer

  what time do you think it is seno-
rita seward inquired

  it must be three or four in the morn-
ing senor it has been a long hard
night for me there is no stirrup on
the side where i have my injured foot
could you not fix something to support
it oh it hurts hurts

  certainly senorita pardon me for
being so thoughtless when a man is
blind there are things he fails to
realize

  seward released the lines and took
the coil of pack rope one end of which
was binding the heavy bag to the saddle
cantle the moment he released the
lines the girl caught them up then she
struck the horse

  the pack rope was uncoiled and
seward twisted it about his hands the
sudden start of the horse flung him
from his feet but he clung to the rope
the drag of his body presently brought
the horse to a halt

  im sorry faltered the girl some-
thing must have startled the horse
yes agreed seward something
certainly startled him

  you were not hurt

  he laughed hurt you ask a des-
ert man if he is hurt by a little tumble
like that

  gropingly he made a loop in the pack
rope adjusted the dangling foot in the
loop laid a firm hold on the reins and
once more started the horse

  i suppose he remarked casually
that dealing faro must be a very
fascinating pastime

  si said the girl but keeping track
of the hands always bothered me i
never can seem to get it straight
whether three of a kind beat what is
called a full house or a straight or
some of the other combinations i
wouldnt make a very good gambler
senor

  i should think not-dealing that
kind of faro que dia es hoy seno-
rita

  there was no answer to this nothing
but a strained silence broken only by the
dull footfalls of the horse

  que dice usted went on seward

  the silence continued no estoy
acostumbrado a que nadie juegue con-
migo seward remarked do you un-
derstand that senorita

  it has been a long time since i have
talked spanish said the girl and i
know only a few words of it at forty-
mile we talk english all the time

  sewards lips again twisted into a
grim smile his little tests which he
had started with the questions about the
rattlesnake and the phantom gold were
bearing fruit

  you have seen tumbling stone
mountain senorita he continued

  i have heard of it but i have never
been near it was the answer

  now in going through the gorge
that brings one to tumbling stone
mountain from quinlan-

  there is no gorge the girl cut in
at least she added hastily correcting
herself i have heard that there is no
gorge-nothing but flat country after
you turn from the main tres alamos
trail

  you are correct about that quite
correct

  seward had discovered all that he
wanted to know for an hour or more
he plodded along in silence beside the
horse

  it was the girl who roused herself at
last to announce dawn is breaking
sefior
east of sunrise



  gracias said seward i am sorry
i cannot see the dawn for watching the
sun rise and set is one of my greatest
diversions out in the desert there is
nothing more beautiful in nature seno-
rita we must be drawing close to the
end of our journey but tell me was
dirk sanger ever at forty-mile
why do you mention dirk sanger
demanded the girl almost fiercely

  because he seems to be very much
in my mind just now he has a sister
lola did you ever meet lola sanger
i never did

  there is a very remarkable girl if
i am any judge she helped her brother
in some of his lawless escapades but
never of her own choice i am con-
vinced her brother forced her to help
him

  why are you so sure of that

  by observation being a prospector
trains one to be a close observer seno-
rita when dirk sanger was captured
the first time he was attempting to hold
up a motorist by tumbling stone moun-
tain his sister was with him at the
time the attempt failed and the mo-
torist brought sanger and his sister into
tres alamos and turned them over to
the sheriff it just happened senorita
that i was the motorist

  the girl twisted in her saddle and
he heard her uneasy movements

  as we neared tres alamos se-
ward proceeded i was so deeply im-
pressed with the character of miss
sanger that i offered her her freedom
and she would not accept it she was
very devoted to her brother and declared
that she would share his troubles and go
through with them to the bitter end i
was sorry you see i cannot make
war on women i hated to think that i
would be the cause of sending lola
sanger to the penitentiary well as it
chanced i did not have that to think
of after all the two sangers escaped
from the jail they had friends on the
outside who helped them of course

miss sanger it was supposed left this
part of the country and went east her
brother remained in the deserts con-
tinued his lawlessness and was cap-
tured at the old esmeralda mine i
had something to do with that too i

am wondering-

  i am not interested senor broke
in the girl shortly anyhow there is
los cerillos in the distance and we are
now at the place where i must leave
you the house of my friends is close
to the trail at this point

  i will take you to the house se-
ward offered

  no i prefer to go there alone i
can attract their attention and they will
come and give me any help i may need
seward helped her to dismount from
the horse and then climbed into the
empty saddle

  all right miss sanger he said
how you came to be where i found
you and in the plight in which i found
you i do not know but i am giving you
the same chance which i offered you
weeks ago-the chance to keep your
freedom and get out of this country i
hope you feel differently about the mat-
ter now adios

  and lola sanger in blank amazement
watched him as he rode onward toward
los cerillos

chapter xi

at the pelican mine

ith ethel norcross as a passenger
in their car blake and reeves had
a trying trip southward along the her-
mosito trail they had two blow-outs
for the intense heat coupled with the
grinding of the tires through the sand
expanded to the bursting point the air in
the tubes then engine trouble devel-
oped and much time was lost while
reeves experimented with the motor

  had everything gone well with them
they might have reached the pass east of
sunrise canon before red galloway


top-notch magazine

driving sandy had entered it or better
still they might have overtaken gallo-
way on the trail between the hogback
and the pass in the latter event a
tragedy would have been averted but
it was not to be

  nor did they meet chombo racing
northward with the led horse the far-
flung rays of their headlights gleaming
across the desert was sufficient warning
for the half-breed and he had turned
from the trail and lost himself in the
greasewood brush until the car had
passed

  blake and reeves searched the dark
pass with their flash lights as well as
they could but the search was in vain
the delays they had experienced had
brought them into the pass after sun-
down and there was not much chance
of making any important discoveries
they decided to proceed to los cerillos
and return to the pass the next morn-
ing to make a thorough investigation by
daylight

  there were no more than a dozen
adobes in the camp the more pretentious
being the store and hotel operated by the
proprietors-now by the proprietor-of
the pelican mine it was the mine alone
that gave the camp its excuse for ex-
istence

  ethel anxious to find and warn se-
ward and grievously disappointed be-
cause they had failed to do so went to
the hotel and there passed the remaining
hours of the night blake and reeves
stayed with a deputy who was the sole
representative of the law in that region
in the morning blake and reeves had
breakfast with ethel at the hotel then
following the meal they took the girl to
a corral back of the hotel and showed
her sandy sewards burro contentedly
munching a ration of hay inside the in-
closure

  i told you ethel exclaimed blake
sewards here and you have had all
your worry for nothing

  a magical change came over the girl

her face brightened her brown eyes
glowed and then her brows knitted in
a pbzzled frown but where is he if
hes in the camp she asked

  probably over at the pelican mine
blake told her his business would take
him there wouldnt it besides spar-
ling the new owner of the mine is an
old friend of sewards they used to
know each other in the east

  ill go over there at once said ethel
turning away

  just a moment before you go in-
terposed blake

  he led her to a shed beside the corral
and showed her the pack taken from the
burro whats all this do you sup-
pose  the sheriff asked dipping a hand
into one of the saddlebags and bringing
into sight a handful of iron washers

  ethel was amazed why she ex-
claimed he put the gold in the saddle-
bags  i saw him

  have you any theory to account for
these iron washers being in the bags
now in place of the gold  blake asked
her

  the girl shook her head bewildered
well joe and i have a theory the
sheriff went on somehow seward got
the idea that he was going to have trou-
ble on the trip south so he made up a
dummy package blake laughed
thats a regular seward trick play
he added these are big washers and
theyll probably weigh as much as five
thousand dollars in gold he kicked
the bags vigorously certainly they
rattle like the real thing

  when was the burro brought in
asked ethel

  we werent concerned about that
he wasnt here last night when we ar-
rived and he was here this morning
when we got up and started for the
hotel you cant down seward of
sacatone by gorry a hundred chom-
bos and a hundred lola sangers
wouldnt be equal to it run along to
the mine ethel joe and i will smoke
east of sunrise



our pipes in the hotel office until you
come hack with seward

  the mine was just over a hill and
the stamp mill was pounding away on
the ore as ethel came down the slope
toward the headquarters adobe the
office door was open and she had a look
inside before she stepped across the
threshold

  the adobe contained a single room
meagerly furnished with a desk a letter
file a mineral cabinet in one corner and
two or three chairs a woman of
twenty-eight or twenty-nine as ethel
judged was sitting before the desk a
man in a norfolk jacket and knicker-
bockers was walking up and down be-
side the desk he was a small man
and both he and the woman bore about
them the unmistakable impress of the
east

   i tell you leora the man was say-
ing im going to be the mining king
of this part of the country with five
thousand dollars in cash i can buy out
old man holsaples prospect next to the
pelican property farther down the val-
ley the pelican lead is under the
holsaple holdings thats what im go-
ing to use that money for when it comes
from tres alamos holsaple is an old
hassayamper and he wont take my
check hes got to have the money cash
down

  there was something in this that
brought a flutter of apprehension to
ethel norcross the money then had
not arrived from tres alamos where
was walt seward his burro was in
the corral but where was he 

  ethel entered the room pardon
me she said but i came here to ask
about mr seward can you tell me
where he is

   the little man in the knickers whirled
to an about-face the woman at the
desk rose instantly to her feet

  you mean seward of sacatone
asked the man

  yes

  what makes you think we know
anything albout him he is one of
these desert adventurers rowdy and

half desperado he-

  stop cried ethel youre the
only man i ever heard speak of mr
seward in that slighting way i am
miss norcross daughter of the junior
partner of simms  norcross at tres
alamos the money you wanted was
sent to you several days ago by simms
 norcross and mr seward was bring-
ing it to you mr seward told us that
you were an old friend of his and that
hed be glad to oblige you but i guess
the girl added with biting sarcasm that
he was mistaken

  he was not mistaken miss nor-
cross said the other woman i am
mrs sparling and my husband here
spoke hastily-and ungenerously she
took ethels hand in a friendly way and
then presented her to mr sparling
we are already under a great obliga-
tion to mr banford and when he
brings the money we shall be still fur-
ther in his debt

  mr banford echoed ethel blankly
sparling laughed this desert hero
he explained goes by one name in the
east and another in the west its a
habit of some people you know to
change their names west of the mis-
souri banford did that probably be-
cause he found it necessary

  he did not find it necessary said
mrs sparling shooting a glance of
sharp disapproval at her husband his
name is walter seward banford and
he chooses to be known here in the
southwest as walter seward he has
made no change-merely dropped his
last name

  i am not interested in that returned
ethel for if mr seward changed his
name or dropped only part of it it
would make no difference to his friends
out here we know him for what he
is and thats enough

  all the same insisted sparling who


top-notch magazine

seemed determined to be disagreeable
if you started him off with that money
more than likely ill never see it

  ethel turned on the little man with
flashing eyes do you mean to infer
that mr seward is untrustworthy
she demanded

  well figure it out for yourself he
started with the money and he hasnt
delivered it whats the answer

  there might be several answers and
all of them more to walt sewards
credit than his discredit ethel was in-
dignant i was planning to bring your
money myself as mr simms could
not leave and my father was not well
enough to make the trip there have
been a number of holdups lately how-
ever and mr seward did not think it
safe for me to act as the messenger
he offered to bring the money himself
because father and i were his friends
and he considered you and mrs spar-
ling his friends he wanted to do what-
ever he could for all of us

  since he started for los cerillos
ethel continued we have discovered
that certain enemies of his learned that
he was bringing the gold and they laid
a trap for him that is why i am here
this morning in his effort to oblige
you mr sparling he has been plunged
into terrible danger the sheriff of
tres alamos and one of his deputies
came with me and they are at the hotel
now mr sewards burro is in the hotel
corral and we supposed that mr se-
ward must be here i-i dont know
what to think

  mrs sparling seemed genuinely
alarmed but her husband appeared
rather exultant

  all ive heard since ive been at this
mine he remarked are wild yarns
about this seward of sacatone he
seems to have done more things that
couldnt be done more things that are
humanly impossible than any little tin
god on wheels i ever heard of and
my wife he went on angrily has been

questioning everybody and writing the
fairy tales down in a book id be glad
to lose that money just to know seward
had decamped with it hes bound to
show his true colors give him time
my husband observed mrs spar-
ling wishes to become the mining king
of this part of the country he is jeal-
ous i think of the fame of seward of
sacatone and he doesnt mean a word
he says miss norcross not a word
sparling puffed out his chest and
stamped the floor and my own wife
can say that of me he exclaimed trag-
ically i wish this seward of sacatone
was here so i could tell him a few
things he finished fiercely

   then said ethel suddenly sobered
a happy light glowing in her brown
eyes you are to have your wish for
here he comes

  mrs sparling had brown eyes also
there wag a haunting light in them a
light of mystery as she looked through
the open door in the direction in which
ethel was gazing

  yes seward of sacatone was com-
ing his hat was gone his khaki shirt
was thick with alkali dust and there
was an ugly bruise on his face but
what really aroused apprehension was
the fact that blake the sheriff was com-
ing with him and blake was leading
him by the hand in the crook of his
left arm seward was carrying a
weighted bag

  what is the matter whispered
mrs sparling agitatedly what do
you suppose can be the matter
nothing matters said ethel calm-
ly so long as he is really here he is
bringing your money mr sparling and
it is plain that he has had to fight to
keep it for you but that is like him
he will fight and fight hard to help-a
friend

  slowly stumblingly seward ap-
proached guided by the hand of the
sheriff

  it seems good jerry those in the
east of sunrise



office heard him say to blake to be
around where my friends are once
more

  thats the idea walt answered
blake steady here we are

chapter xii

 finishing a good job

ljeres sparling walt said blake
as the two entered the office he
cant see sparling he explained he
has covered forty miles of desert with-
out the use of his eyes some stunt
if anybody asks you

  no said seward smiling it was
easy you see i had a cerillos horse to
bring me in

  blind gasped mrs sparling her
voice throbbing with sympathy

  sun-blind leora explained se-
ward apprised of mrs sparlings pres-
ence by the sound of her voice merely
a slight inflammation of the cornea-i
think that is what the doctors call it-
brought on by the glare of the sun
the pupils of the eyes close up as no
doubt you can see but its unimpor-
tant two or three days with ice packs
on my eyes and ill see as well as ever
the important thing is vic that heres
your money minus just one twenty-
dollar gold piece ill make that up to
you

  he reached out the bag and sparling
relieved him of it kindly excuse my
battered appearance leora i just this
minute rode in and jerry here was the
first one to meet me i came directly
to the mini because the quicker i get
out from under that bag of gold the
better ill feel ill thank you for a re-
ceipt vic so i can give it to simms 
norcross next time im in tres
alamos

  blake looked at ethel grinned and
shook his head the message he meant
to convey as ethel translated it was
that he had not told seward she was
there

  sparling had dumped the gold eagles
upon a table and was busily counting
them all here but one he an-
nounced leora kindly write banford
a receipt for the full amount less twen-
ty dollars

  mrs sparling turned to the desk and
tightened her lips after writing for a
moment she turned and put the sheet of
paper in sewards hand theres a re-
ceipt for the full amount walt she
said after all you must have gone
through with this money of ours i dont
think we need to haggle over a missing
gold piece a receipt isnt necessary

either since-

  she was about to say since miss
norcross was there to see that the
money had been delivered but blake
restrained her with a gesture

  i want you to know walt that i am
grateful to you mrs sparling went on
a tremble in her voice i am pretty sure
you took all this trouble for me and

that-

  you are wrong there leora se-
ward interrupted id do a lot for you
and victor of course but id never have
undertaken to transport that gold to
cerillos if i hadnt been afraid a little
girl i know in tres alamos would have
tried to bring it herself it wasnt ex-
actly safe for her and im rather fussy
about letting her take any such long
chances a wonderful girl leora her
name is ethel-ethel norcross i want
you to meet her some time

  mrs sparling shifted her gaze to
ethel a wonderful light had leaped
into the girls eyes she stepped for-
ward quickly and flung her arms about
sewards neck

  walt walt she whispered and
mr blake didnt tell you i was here
sewards arms tightened about the
slender form mrs sparling looked
away again with the haunting light in
her eyes-a light that suggested dreams
that might once have been realized but
were now lost forever


top-notch magazine

  well anyway grumbled sparling
twenty dollars is twenty dollars you
know

  blake pulled a roll of bills from his
pocket stripped a twenty from the
outside and dropped it at sparlings feet
there it is you measly little tightwad 
he snapped come on walt and lets
be going why do you want to hang
around here i thought you said spar-
ling was a friend of yours 

  so he is or was seward answered
a new york friend he means all
right so long vic he put out his
hand if i can ever do anything more
for you just get word to me

  sparling laid a flabby white hand in
the sunbrowned palm

  good-by leora

  good-by walt said mrs sparling
in a voice scarcely audible

  then she stood and watched blake
striding away up the hillside and ethel
and seward following him hand in
hand

  im ashamed of you vic she re-
marked turning to her husband

  all right he told her that evens
the score for the way you flung seward
of sacatone at me

  does it she returned

  sparling stared at his wife but she
was engaged in some work at the desk
and did not look up

  blake strode rapidly back to los
cerillos but ethel and seward went
more slowly ethel started to tell him
of the story brought to tres alamos by
eph springer

  ive had all that from blake ethel
he told her

  is it true walt

  some of it the plan was laid and
an attempt was made to carry it out la
joya did her part but if chombo and
lola sanger hadnt failed i would not
be here

  the little hand that was guiding se-
ward tightened on his

  who brought sandy to cerillos

  nobody ethel he seems to have
come of his own accord

  how did he get away from you i
thought that you and sandy were in-
separable

  seward laughed eph springer told
you that red galloway had come south
to find me and warn me he said
well he found me after i had lost my
sight his horse had got away from
him during the sandstorm and he man-
aged to reach my camp by the hogback
on foot he had more nerve than i ever
gave him credit for ethel and he made
off with sandy and what he thought was
the gold he took my revolver too and
my hat and coat galloway thought he
was making a pretty complete job of it
i reckon

  ethel had an idea about what time
did galloway leave you walt she
asked

  early in the afternoon

  and which way did he go 

  toward sonora he wanted me to
tell springer that he was cutting loose
from him for good with five thousand
dollars in gold he thought he could cut
a pretty wide swath in mexico

 red galloway would go south
through the pass wouldnt he

  yes

  and about what time would he reach
the pass driving the burro ahead of
him

  probably before daylight failed
  and wearing your coat and hat and

driving sandy- ethel paused a

tense note in her voice walt she ex-
claimed do you think-would it be

possible-

  i was just thinking of the same
thing sandy wandering by himself
into los cerillos makes it look rather
plausible doesnt it well i dont sup-
pose well ever know the facts in the
case

  if lola sanger can be found-

  shell not be found returned se-
ward briefly
east of sunrise



   then perhaps la joya at forty-
 mile would know

    i have asked blake not to make any
  trouble for la joya or for chombo
  seward added

    why did you do that  ethel wanted
  to know

    they were acting according to their
  lights seward explained i spoiled a
  big sale for chombo once and he had
  reason to hate me in his half-breed way
  as for lola sanger i have twice cap-
  tured her brother and his career is at
  an end lola is devoted to sanger con-
  sequently she felt it her duty to be re-
  venged against me and who and what
  was red galloway a desert rogue
  and a thief as you well know if one
  of chombos arrows picked him off in
  the pass then unwittingly chombo did a
  good turn for law and order it was
  galloways horse that wandered to my
  camp by the hogback cerillos was the
  animals home camp and whenever he
  got away from red he put out always
  for cerillos i was lucky to capture the
  horse for he brought me straight here
  when i gave him the rein why not let
  well enough alone 

    youre a strange man walt ex-
 claimed the girl dont you want to
 play even with your enemies

    somehow he replied with a smile
  i never do-unless my enemies make
  things too warm for me if chombo
  hasnt had enough ill take care of him
  but if hes had a lesson and is through
  what more could i ask are we in the
   camp ethel

    yes and im going to take you to
  the hotel and take care of you until you
  get your sight back

    no he answered youre riding
 back to tres alamos with blake and
 reeves im not going to the hotel but
 to hank beesleys shack mrs beesley
 and hank will look after me

   and when will you be in tres
 alamos again walt asked the girl
 eagerly

   as soon as im able to see ill return
to the camp at the hogback theres
some floats there i want to investigate
as soon as i discover that it doesnt lead
to anything important-as i probably
will-im coming to tres alamos
and youll see me

  every time im in tres alamos
after this im going to call on you
mujercita said seward and every
time i call i shall want you to sing for
me that song beginning east of sun-
rise falls the night how does it go
just once ethel right here

  and there by the corral back of the
hotel with sandy cocking his long ears
to listen ethels clear sweet voice was
lifted

     east of sunrise falls the night

west of sundown breaks the day

    and we find our brightest light
      where the darkness paves our way i

  theres truth in that averred se-
ward it was east of sunrise that the
night fell for me novia and through
that darkness i have found a light that
it had seemed for a long time had gone
out for me forever

  blake and reeves coming around the
corner of the hotel halted suddenly on
seeing ethel and seward by the corral
they turned back and hastily effaced
themselves

  jumpin catamounts gasped
reeves them two think a heap of
each other dont they whod ever
have guessed it jerry

  well joe i guessed it-when we
started south to look for seward and
mrs sparling guessed it too if im any
judge

  chombo el arquero remains unmo-
lested at his ranch launching arrows at
the sun and pinning bulls-eyes to the
ground a dozen feet from where he
twanged his bow but there is no hatred
for seward of sacatone he has heard
that seward kept the sheriff off his
trail


top-notch magazine

  out at the posada del rey nino la
joya still deals faro but she has heard
something too and would go far to
help seward of sacatone

  somewhere in the east is lola sang-
er revenge for her brother is no
longer a part of her creed

  over on dead mule flat eph spring-

  er outfitted with the biggest grubstake
he had ever toted into the deserts waited
in vain for his pardner red galloway

  and above the pass east of sunrise

dipped earthward and soared aloft

ways for good and ill

     and i dont like to play

chapter i

making the rounds

heres nothing doing to-day
slater look in again in a
week or so through the
shiny brass grille of his little
window the casting director
of peerless pictures smiled cheerily out
upon sam slater-a smile that the
director bestowed freely to soften the
refusals he was obliged to shower upon
the eager seekers for work who be-
sieged him

  slater turned wearily away as he had
so often done before with just the faint-
est reflection of the casting directors
smile on his features it is much easier
to smile when one is on a pay roll and
this was a distinction sam slater had
not achieved since his arrival in holly-
wood

  a leader in college athletics who had
helped his varsity team to reach many
a proud position in football and track
slater had gone to hollywood mecca
of hope and ambition with only a vague
idea as to bow he was to bring his gifts
and his prowess to bear upon the
movies in one way or another as an

actor or as an athlete he was certain it
could be done but he had been unable
to impress any one else with that belief
and his hopeful smile had become daily
fainter and more wan as he turned
away from the wickets of the casting
directors

  after the directors words slater
moved slowly toward the open door of
the casting office and stood for a mo-
ment trying to determine what studio
he would visit next for it is only by
constantly making the rounds that an
extra can hope to break in

  oh slater just a minute the
casting director called

   slater turned to see the all-powerful
hand beckoning to him through the
wicket that had so long proved a bar-
rier he was unable to storm and has-
tened back to the window

  yes mr hawes he said hope-
fully

  i just remembered-there may be
something here for you hawes re-
turned come in a minute he
pressed the button that released the
latch of his office door

  as slater stepped inside he realized
that the casting director was regarding

him appraisingly-six feet of well-knit
bone and muscle topped by a handsome
head with abundant wavy hair and finely
molded features slater hoped that
given the opportunity he might become
an actor-perhaps a leading man a star
-as he knew so many even less favored
had done

  get out mr slaters card hawes
directed his secretary and while the girl
busied herself at the filing cabinet he
turned again to slater whose pulses had
begun to beat high with expectancy
youre a college man arent you
slater nodded smilingly i took a
small flock of letters at ann arbor he
said but somehow the world hasnt
grown much excited over it as yet
went in for athletics i suppose
yes i played on the football team
and did something in hammer throwing
and broad jumping slater wondered
what these long-forgotten feats had to
do with his appearance before the cam-
era as a movie hero

  hawes had seated himself at his desk
waving slater to a chair beside it as the
secretary laid before him the registra-
tion card that the college man had filed
weeks before with his photograph

  the casting director glanced at the
card this looks pretty good he said
i see you ride swim box fence and
drive an auto

  slater nodded

  ever do any stunts hawes asked
slaters high hopes fell with a mental
thud stunts he had been picturing
himself in a drawing-room scene with a
beautiful heroine-both she and he in
evening dress-leaning over her as she
sat demurely upon a divan and whis-
pering ready-made words of movie-land
love into her ears while the lights
bathed them in a flood of radiance and
the camera caught and prisoned the
girls growing responsiveness to his
pfleadings

  and now he was asked about-
stunts swinging at a ropes end

across a dangerous chasm leaping
lightly from an airplane wing to a flying
auto swimming rapids from an over-
turned canoe-these were things he had
always thought any one with sufficient
nerve and muscles could accomplish

  he knew however that casting direc-
tors are not given to asking aspirants
for the movies to pick their places in
the celluloid hall of fame and he real-
ized that this was the chance he had
been waiting for

  well to be quite frank i have no
record as a stunt man he said but
im willing to try anything once

  thats the talk hawes returned
come in here-i want to have a chat
with you the director led the way
to an inner office where they were shut
away even from the ears of the stenog-
rapher

  when they were seated at either side
of a desk the casting director plunged
at once into the proposition he had in
mind in cyril rands picture thats
now in work he said there is a
sequence in which he drives an auto
across a bridge that is being destroyed
by striking miners for the purposes
of the story it is absolutely necessary
that he cross that bridge at that time
we see the strikers plant the powder
and prepare to fire it rand discovers
the danger at the last moment but he
wont turn back he drives across the
bridge and it is blown up while the car
is rolling off the far end of it will
you double for rand in that scene and
take a chance on being touched off into
the sky

  slater did not answer immediately
while the director talked the younger
man had conjured up a vision of cyril
rand the star world famed as the hero
of scores of such thrill-producing
stunts handsome dashing and a king
among the ladies-on the screen was
it possible that he was a coward at
heart were men like slater himself
expected to have more nerve than the
stunt stuff



much-vaunted and high-salaried star 
he wondered

  why doesnt rand do it is he
afraid he asked bluntly

  the casting director laughed well

i dont know anything about that he
said but the company wouldnt let him
do it if he wanted to we couldnt take
a chance on his high-priced back and
legs and neck-to say nothing of his
handsome face you can see how that
is slater if rand was killed for in-
stance peerless pictures would be out
a good many hundreds of thousands of
dollars they figure to make on his pic-
tures while his popularity lasts-three
or four years more probably

  if he was hurt and laid up in a hos-
pital for a few weeks the director
continued even with a sprained back
or twisted ankle it would cost thousands
to hold up production on the picture
lay off people drawing salary under con-
tracts and all that so you see why we
must put it up to somebody else to fool
with the dynamite hawes laughed

  yes i see slater returned en-
gaging a double for the dangerous
stunts is like taking out an accident-
insurance policy on your star and just
how does the company figure the pre-
mium it is willing to pay for this pro-
tection 

  your end of it a hundred and
fifty hawes replied promptly and
dont you ever think there arent a few
hundred birds here in hollywood who
would jump at the chance of grabbing
it i thought of giving you a chance
because youre about the same build as
rand and you look enough like him to
double for him nicely

  is that all i would do in the pic-
ture slater asked

  theres a chance for some more
work-stunt stuff the casting director
said however jackson is going to
shoot this bridge scene right away he
tells me they start for location to-
morrow morning and anything else you

would get would depend on how you
came out on the explosion scene

  or whether i came out at all
slater grinned all right im on
and i wont ask the company to send
any flowers if i come down with the
pieces of the bridge

  you dont need to ask-the work-
mens compensation law compels em to
bury you and fix up the widow and the
orphans if any hawes said report
to billy reed assistant director of jack-
sons company to-morrow morning
slater left the studio with the first
feeling of elation he had experienced
since coming to hollywood at last he
had a job he had broken through the
barriers that had so long proved im-
pregnable that what had been offered
was far removed from his dreams of
glory on the screen that it was a haz-
ardous stunt occupying but a few min-
utes in the making which would dwindle
to a mere flash when the picture was
shown-these considerations did not at
all tinge his gratification

  he felt that at last he was in and
what the future held depended upon
himself and he was as determined to
make good with jackson the irascible
and temperamental director as though
he had been given a contract for a role
in support of cyril rand

chapter ii

the shining star

when slater reached the studio
next morning director jacksons
company with more than a hundred
extras in flannel shirts and scarred
boots who were to enliven the mine-
strike scenes were being piled into
autos and huge sight-seeing busses at
the main entrance

  trailers filled with box lunches bot-
tled milk and other joys of the luncheon
period were being checked over by
prop boys under the guidance of billy
reed the assistant directorwho seemed


top-notch magazine

to make a light task of being in seven
places at once with ten or twelve dif-
ferent lists and schedules in his hands
requiring immediate attention

  the big gleaming car of cyril rand
with the star lolling upon the cushions
and basking in the admiring gaze of
the inevitable group of tourists stood
apart awaiting what members of the
cast rand should deign to invite for
the trip just behind it was director
jacksons car the rear seat occupied by
margaret phillips the leading woman
and two other actresses bedizened in
the war paint of the movies the di-
rector chased madly to and from the
general offices on a dozen last-minute
quests

  it was all familiar enough to sam
slater for he had witnessed scores of
such starts to location in the back
country and he seized the first oppor-
tunity to catch billy reed on the wing
and report for duty

  the assistant director thumbed over
a list of names until he found slaters
and then gave him an appraising glance

  oh youre the stunt man

  thats what they tell me the
other smiled suppressing a little wince
at his new title

  just climb into that bus reed or-
dered indicating one of the big cars that
already held fifty or more extras and
hunt me up when we get out there

  slater nodded acquiescence and walked
to the bus where he surveyed the not
too prepossessing assemblage of strik-
ers with whom his lot was cast but he
was in for it now he was an extra
like the rest of them when he had fond-
ly hoped to be an actor and with a
shrug of the shoulders that seemed to
shake off his distaste for his surround-
ings he climbed aboard a minute
later director jacksons car pulled out
heading the caravan the big bus swung
into line behind half a dozen autos and
slater felt with a little thrill that at
last he was launched on his movie career

  it was a drive of more than an hour
to the narrow canon in the mountains
which had been selected by jackson as
the location for the thrilling scene in
which the hero made his dash for life
across the threatened bridge and on the
way slater chatted as amiably with his
seat companions as though extra work
had been his vocation for years he
made no revelations as to the part he
was scheduled to play in other mens
wives though he realized that his well-
groomed appearance without costume
or make-up must have aroused much
curiosity on that score

  when he climbed down from the bus
into a bedlam of chatter laughter cries
of greeting among the players and the
shouted orders of a dozen subbosses on
director jacksons big crew slater
found his attention centered upon the
bridge which had been built over a
roaring canon stream for the explosion
in which he was to enact the most thrill-
ing role of the picture

  he walked to the abutment to inspect
the structure more closely it was
sturdily built of timbers and planks
masked in a shell of field stones that
gave it an appearance of solidity but
these slater noted were not set in
mortar and would fall into heaps of
ruin under the shock of the blast

  along the underside of the bridge
a set of wires led from the tangled
underbrush to the center of the arch
and there slater saw something that
made his eyes widen a trifle-a long
box into which the wires passed and
through the open end of which he could
see two kegs of giant powder awaiting
the spark that would send the bridge
skyward

  for the first time the actual danger
of the stunt for which he had enlisted
dawned upon him as slater saw the
businesslike wires leading from a con-
cealed battery to the explosive and he
no longer wondered why cyril rand
was not keen for driving the auto across
stunt stuff



the bridge in a mad dash to beat that
deadly spark

  an error of an instant in firing the
blast-a miscalculation in the transmis-
sion of signals-and it would be all over
with the driver of that car

  however there was not a thought of
flunking in slaters mind as he turned
away with a little grin and went in quest
of billy reed slater had signed up
with fate and he was determined to see
the stunt through

  he found the assistant director busier
than any four other men on the loca-
tion as usual but with a welcoming
smile for him

  oh here you are reed said
thought you might have taken it on
the run back to town when you saw the
fireworks come over and meet jack-
son-he wants to talk to you

  not a chance of my going back ahead
of the outfit unless they take me back
in an ambulance slater returned
how soon do we shoot the big shot
jackson wants to get at it right
away because well have to build another
bridge and retake the whole business if
it doesnt look good reed said
theres always a chance for something
to go wrong in this kind of a shot
thats it-cheer me up slater re-
joined if anything goes wrong ill
probably go with it

  they tiad been walking toward a
group in which director jackson was
the dominant figure although cyril
rand the star was a member of it
slater saw that the director was talking
with tongue head and hands while the
others listened he stopped and turned
inquiringly as billy reed and the good-
looking stranger joined them

  heres your stunt man the as-
sistant director said moving under his
own power and all rarin to go

  slater was immediately conscious of
sharp glances not only from jackson
but from cyril rand and a charming
young woman who stood beside the star

and whom slater recognized as mar-
garet phillips leading woman of the
company

  oh yes-hawes spoke to me about
you the director said to slater as he
took in the big fellows dimensions
youre new to this work hawes tells

     

me

  absolutely slater returned but
im here to do what im told as long
as i hold together

  theres nothing to this explosion
scene jackson said ill have things
timed so it will be absolutely safe but
it ought to produce a great effect i
want you to meet cyril rand he went
on turning toward the star in a manner
of introduction since youre to dou-
ble for him you ought to see how much
you look like him and miss phillips
-whom you are supposed to drive over
the bridge he added this is sam
slater

  slater acknowledged the introductions
with a bow toward the actor and actress
miss phillips awarded him a friendly
smile but rands only recognition of
his presence was a supercilious nod and
a slow stare that took him in from
head to foot

  to rand it was apparent from his
manner slater was just an extra whom
the celebrity was not disposed to accept
upon terms of social or professional
equality

  theres just one thing youll have
to keep in mind slater while youre
doubling for me the star said and
that is dont look at the camera

  slater flushed and a very suitable
retort rose to his lips but before he
could voice it director jackson inter-
vened

  thatll be all right cyril the di-
rector said sharply ill take care of
where slater looks and where he doesnt
look im going to direct the scene you
know

  the import of the incident was not
lost upon three other members of the
top-notch magazine

company who had stood by looking on
and listening nor was it lost upon billy
reed the disposition of their star to
adopt a high-hat attitude toward every
one in his support was no secret among
the members of jacksons unit and
naturally it did not tend to endear him
to them

  youre going to take this bridge
stuff first reed asked of his chief
when cyril rand had turned and
strolled away with a little sneering
smile that was meant to hide the rebuke
in jacksons retort

  yes order those fellows down
there below the bridge right away and
well get busy jackson said im
going to work two cameras on this
scene you know and it takes doolittle
half an hour to set up usually

  the assistant director nodded briskly
and turned to slater who had been
curiously watching rands departure
and wondering how he had incurred his
displeasure come on slater reed
said stick around with me and see
how we do it

  they walked on half a dozen paces
before reed spoke again he knew
the other man was thinking of cyril
rands behavior and he sought to mol-
lify him

  dont pay any attention to what
handsome hector says the assistant
director began it takes him four hours
a day to make up because he cant tear
himself from the mirror we have to
use a double for him every time he rides
a horse or jumps into a river or drives
a car and he has an ingrowing fear that
his dear public will find out about it
because all the other men in the world
are such ugly brutes you know

  im not worrying about him slater
laughed if i ever get to be a star ill
probably be a little bit ritzy myself
when an extra dares to look up at me
i can keep out of rands orbit all right
and let him shine without wasting any
of his light on me

chapter iii

seeking adventure

it was nearly two hours later before

  jackson was ready to shoot the big
bridge scene-two hours crowded with
work for the director billy reed and
the camera men and during all of it
slater kept as close as he could to the
busy assistant director

  in that time a hundred extras had
been herded before the cameras under
and around the bridge while the pre-
liminary scenes were taken in which
they were supposed to be planting the
explosives under the structure wading
into the water and climbing on heavy
boulders in the stream they carried out
empty powder cans which had all the
terrifying appearance of reality and
tucked them into place while the cam-
eras ground merrily and the scores of
bewhiskered strikers not actually en-
gaged in the dirty work madly cheered
on their confederates

  of course those powder cans are
empty and we will have a big fuse
lighted to burn up to them for the
spectacular effect reed explained to
slater while the real charge planted
in that big box will be fired at the
proper moment by electricity when
she lets go the auto will have to be
just at the far end of the bridge because
things are going to fly high just as
soon as that box of giant stuff goes
off

  didnt i hear jackson say miss phil-
lips was supposed to be in the car with
me slater asked anxiously

  yes shes supposed to be reed
replied with a grin and well show her
in the car with rand just before the
dash for life of course but when you
take the car over youll have a hand-
some dummy seated beside you made
up to double for our leading woman
so far as clothes go we cant take
chances with miss phillips any more
than we can with rand
stunt stuff

  oh of course slater said thats
a big relief i was worrying about that
feature of my pleasant little job
jacksons ready for the scene now
reed told him lets get up there at
the end of the bridge where the auto is
before he has a fit this is one scene
that cant be retaken half a dozen times
when they reached the spot where
the director stood with rand margaret
phillips and half a dozen technical as-
sistants beside the touring car they
found jackson in the midst of an argu-
ment with the star as usual

  but its so unnecessary cyril
rand was protesting

  thats for me to decide the di-
rector returned youre not afraid the
bridge wont hold up under the car are
you its been tested a dozen times
im keen for it cyril margaret
phillips interposed i rather like the
thrill of it im not afraid

  billy reed looked from cyril rand
to his chief questioningly while slater
stood back watching and listening

  ive decided to send rand over the
bridge with miss phillips in the car be-
fore we make the explosion stuff-just
for a safety shot jackson explained to
his assistant we dont know how the
explosion is going to look and im not
anxious to build that bridge again for
retakes so im going to make this
straight scene of rand on the bridge
to cut in if i should need it

  good idea reed assented whats
the objection and he flashed an in-
quiring look at rand

  oh its such tommyrot the star
protested we cant use a scene of my
crossing the bridge in safety when the
script requires it to be blown up behind
me and i dont see any common sense
in driving a car over half a ton of
dynamite to make a scene that cant be
used thats rational isnt it

  not only rational but ridiculous
jackson snapped well take it right
away billy get doolittle to set up

back there where he can get the whole
bridge and both banks

  as reed hurried away to instruct the
camera men on the new order a prop-
erty boy touched slaters elbow

  heres your make-up the boy said
extending an overcoat and a cap mr
reed said all youd need was a duplicate
of mr rands cap and coat

  thank you-these will be fine
slater said taking the garments that
were to make of him an imitation of the
star and he grinned a bit at the thought
tossing aside his own hat he slipped
on the overcoat and donned the cap
even without a mirror he could recog-
nize what a faithful replica of cyril
rand the clothes made him for the two
men were doubles in build and strikingly
alike in features

  by the time he turned again to the
group near him jackson had evidently
prevailed upon rand to forego his ob-
jections to making the bridge scene for
the star was seated in the touring car
with miss phillips beside him jack-
son through his megaphone was shout-
ing orders to the two camera men as
rand slowly moved the car toward the
entrance to the bridge slater walked
up close hidden from the cameras by
the automobile to watch and listen

  ready  the director shouted toward
the group of assistants behind the cam-
eras now just one thing more
light that fuse

  oh my lord rand gasped what
for whats the idea of the fuse
isnt it-isnt it dangerous now
dont be a dumb-bell jackson
jelled at him the fuse isnt con-
nected  it will burn out at the bridge
but weve got to show it burning to get
any kick into the scene dont we now
you get ready to drive when i give the
word-and dont forget to step on it
youre rescuing this girl from the heavy
and his gang youre supposed to be
risking your life and hers for a get-
away make it snappy
top-notch magazine

  yes and ive got one of the con-
founded old company cars that im not
used to rand complained as he fum-
bled with the gear shift and tested the
gas ive got a swell chance to show
speed with this old boat

  well use your new roadster-if you
want to take a chance on having it
blown into the creek the director coun-
tered but dont forget for an instant
this incident is the punch of the picture
-and we may have to use this shot
get ready now he turned to hurry
down behind the cameras

  meanwhile one of the extras had
waded into the stream and stood ready
to light the long fuse under the bridge
when jackson should give the word to
the camera men this was a scene pre-
liminary to the entrance of rand upon
the bridge in the auto the director
shouted to doolittle and the cameras
began grinding as the man applied a
match to the fuse and started on a quick
climb back to the bank

  when the fuse was sputtering and
flashing director jackson who had
reached his post behind the cameras
waved and shouted his signal to rand
all right cyril come ahead-lively

  all this time slater had been stand-
ing well back of the auto close to a
wall of dirt through which a cut had
been made for the temporary road by
the studio workmen neither rand
nor margaret phillips intent upon the
active group of workers away off on
the bank of the stream was aware of
his presence

  as rand stepped on the starter and
prepared to make the drive slater was
seized with an inspiration for a mad
prank the idea behind which he was
never able to determine stepping for-
ward quickly before the car began to
move he stepped on the running board
at the rear door and crouched there
out of sight clinging to the door han-
dle and resting against the curve of the
broad fender

  for good or for evil he was in on
cyril rands dash across the bridge and
slater smiled as he contemplated the
surprised and indignant face that self-
sufficient star would have shown had he
known that his double was clinging to
the outside of the car seeking adven-
ture

  rand started the car and as it rolled
out on the bridge and began to pick up
speed slater could hear the director
from far off on the left bank shouting
orders and impatient admonitions to the
actor who had never shone as a driver
and he lost none of what rand confided
to margaret phillips was his private
and personal opinion of the director the
automobile and the stunt upon which
they were engaged

  then slater felt the speed of the car
slacken instead of picking up as they
got well into the camera angle

  i tsld jackson this bum old boat
would fall down on him rand said to
the leading woman and slater chuckled
silently over the stars discomfiture

  whats the matter with you the
directors strident voice came to them
through his megaphone step on it
wake up rand youre wasting film
on this funeral procession

  rand snorted his disgust as he
pressed the accelerator without result
beyond a spasmodic jump or two of the
car but he did not try to reply jack-
son was too far away

  wish that chump was driving this
thing he growled to miss phillips
probably some of his hired hands for-
got to put gas into the tank

  that cant be it the leading woman
said we wouldnt move at all with-
out gas

  well theres something wrong
he grumbled as they approached the
center of the bridge i dont pretend
to be a chauffeur so i dont know what
it is i have my man look after those
things and-

  whats all that smoke miss phil-
stunt stuff



lips interrupted him with a quick little
cry of alarm

  its that confounded fuse jackson
had em set off rand replied

  no fuse could make that much
smoke she protested the bridge is
on fire

  slater leaned out quickly and looked
ahead clouds of smoke were curling
from beneath the arch of the bridge
and there came to him the unmistakable
odor of burning pine

  shouts of alarm orders directions-
a medley of excited calls-came from
jackson billy reed the property men
and actors on the bank of the stream
as rand wakened to the fact that miss
phillips was right the fuse had fired
the flimsy false work of the bridge and
a brisk mountain breeze was fanning
the blaze into a formidable danger

chapter iv

with a sharp order

rrive drive faster the director
shouted were grinding on you
cyril step on it and youre all right

  however shouts and orders and
rands frantic desire to get across the
blazing bridge did not inspire the labor-
ing old auto to swifter motion it
moved uncertainly forward under
rands desperate jabs at the accelerator
and raking of gas and spark levers on
the quadrant

  the car reached the center of the
bridge wreathed in billows of smoke
and with flames crackling briskly be-
neath it and there in a climax of con-
trariness it stalled

  as it ceased to move and rands
plunges at the starter brought no an-
swering whir a sudden recollection
brought a shriek of terror from mar-
garet phillips

  the powder she screamed well
be killed

  and she collapsed in a faint against
rands shuddering shoulder

  the babel of shouted advice and di-
rections from the excited group on the
bank swelled to a confusing roar as the
actor fumbled helplessly with the car
and half rose as though to jump out and
run for safety

  less than a minute had elapsed from
the time the car stalled until slater
opened the rear door beside which he
had been crouching and climbed into the
machine keeping his head and shoulders
below the line of vision of the watchers
on the shore raising the seat cushion
he felt among the scattered tools until
he found the crank and dragged it forth

  then he revealed his presence to cyril
rand with a sharp order climb over
the back of that seat and get in here
slater told him

  the startled actor turned as though
he had been jabbed with a knife and
stared uncomprehendingly at slater
the face of the star was blanched with
terror startling events had succeeded
one another so rapidly that he was in
a mental daze

  quick climb over slater
shouted

  at last the command stirred rand to
action pushing the inert form of mar-
garet phillips to the outer edge of the
seat he waveringly clambered over into
the rear compartment

  now get down here on the floor-
and stay there dont show your
head slater ordered theyre shoot-
ing this scene and i dont want to
spoil it

  rand slumped to the floor slater
stood up stepped over the quaking star
and climbed down from the car crank
in hand on the side nearest the cam-
eras he stopped long enough at the
front seat to release the clutch and
assure himself that the ignition was on
then hurrying to the front he cranked
the old engine desperately

  three times-four times-he tugged
and heaved in vain but at the next ef-
fort the motor turned over and with a


top-notch magazine

roar of protest the sulky old mechanism
went back to work

  leaving the crank dangling in its
place slater jumped into the drivers
seat and with careful and steady hands
started the car on its way he speeded
it up through the smoke and fire and
guided it across the shaky bridge

  and as the rear wheels took the solid
ground beyond the structure he heard
a mighty blast behind him the bridge
shot skyward in blazing fragments and
the imposing-looking stonework rat-
tled and splashed into the stream

chapter v

a humdinger of a shot

there was a rush of actors and
extras technical men and the rest
of the crew the oncomers headed by
director jackson to greet slater as he
stopped the car and turned quickly to
raise margaret phillips and carry her
from the auto

  his back was toward the oncoming
crowd but slater heard their cheers and
shouts of commendation before they
were near him

  good boy great stuff cyril
fine work rand the director ex-
claimed as he ran to the auto we
never quit cranking and that ought to
make a humdinger of a shot couldnt
have planned it that way old man

and- jackson stopped short as

slater turned to face him holding miss
phillips in his arms

  give me a hand with miss phillips
please slater said shell be all right
in a few minutes i guess

  slater jackson shouted while
billy reed and the rest of them piled
around the car in dumb amazement

  cyril rands head and shoulders
slowly appeared above the rear door of
the automobile his face still white and
drawn well have to call it off for
to-day jackson he said im not
feeling quite fit

  instant revelation of what had oc-
curred came to those in the forefront
of the crowd and as two of the men
took margaret phillips from slaters
arms jackson smiled grimly

  all right cyril the director said
you can knock off for the day i guess
we can make out for a few scenes with
slater-if hes careful not to look at
the camera hes just given us after
taking your place when you were too
scared to act the best shot weve had
since noah was a baby

the right idea

  reginald was dining out and under
the watchful eyes of his father and
mother he was behaving really well

  will you have a little of this rice
pudding reggie asked the hostess

no thank you replied reggie

  mother nearly gasped never be-
fore had her little darling refused
pudding

  oh come dear the hostess said
do have a little

  no thank you said reggie

  then what will you have asked
the hostess

  a lot please replied reggie
firmly

eye for business

  somehow young rushabout had pre-
vailed upon his rich grandfather to buy
him a big flashy automobile

  the agreement was that rushabout
should pay the money back in install-
ments and that the machine was to re-
main the grandfathers property until
the last payment was made

  long before this was made rush-
about met his grandfather on the road

  who does this machine belong to
the younger man asked politely

  its mine until the last installment
is paid but why do you ask

  well i just wanted to make sure
er-your car needs four new tires

sudden change

       utside of the managers door
 jack allen hesitated his
 hand reaching for the knob
 trembled slightly and he drew
 it back evidently trying to
 master the sudden weakness that surged
 through him his shoulders drooped
 perceptibly and the shadow of despair
 darkened his gray eyes for jack allen
 knew that he had lost the game that
 afternoon-knew in fact that he had
 never looked worse young thomas
 just up from the sticks had finished
 the contest brilliantly and in view of
 that and the other fact that the gulls
 roster was overcrowded allen could
 place but one construction on the man-
 agers summons-the blue ticket

   the next instant however he shook
 off the depression it had to come
 some time might as well be now he
 said and with a shrug of his shoulders
 swung open the door of the hotel room

   hello jack the manager greeted
 him from behind a desk

   hello jess returned allen easily
 it would never do for an old star
 though traveling the down grade to
 show emotion before a man who never
 was in the big leagues

a novelette

   sit down jack i want to talk to
 you a bit

   thanks the big pitcher pulled a
 chair close to the desk

   the manager jess whitford wrote
 rapidly for a minute or two and then
 pushed paper and pen away as he looked
 up quizzically you did a rotten job
 of pitching out there to-day old man
 he began

   i know it allen said

   too bad commented the manager
 id like to give you a chance to redeem
 yourself jack but i cant do it sorry
 but ive got to let you go

   allen looked up stony eyed his
 tongue darted out to moisten dry lips
 but his protest was mild youd ought
 to have known that game was coming
 jess he said slowly youve worked
 me to death saving games and a man
 forty years old isnt what he was at
 twenty ive done my best for you and
 i think ive done pretty well im not
 through quite yet but i know how
 it is youth must be served and a
 young man coming is worth more to
 you than an old one going its all
 right jess of course im a free
 agent

   there might have been bitterness in
 jack allens heart but little of it got
 into his voice he was accepting the


top-notch magazine

inevitable his gaze wandered to the
window and then came back with a jerk
when the great booming laugh of the
managers burst out

  free agent nothing roared jess
whitford in high glee man listen
youre going back to the big time ive
just sold you to the panthers

  wh-what-the devil stammered
allen half rising as a lightninglike thrill
shot through him then the strength
left his legs and he sat down heavily

  fact announced whitford you
go east to-night to join the panthers
who are about to start on their western
swing theyre within one game of the
lead and going great guns old gil
black figures your experience and cun-
ning will save just enough games to put
them over he rose and came around
the desk mighty few have done what
you are going to do old boy my con-
gratulations and best wishes whit-
ford held out his hand

  dazed allen rose too good lord
jess i-i cant realize this he ex-
claimed as he grasped the managers
hand its eight years since i left the
big leagues forty years old and-and
going back to the big time

  to make good again too supple-
mented whitford youve cut out the
old ways lived carefully out here on
the coast worked easy and the climate
has done something to that old whip
jack old man if you work cautiously
pitch with your head more than with
your arm youd ought to stick it out
up there for a couple of years yet-
and that would help wouldnt it i
got another two thousand stuck onto
your salary the manager coughed
and looked away tears in a mans eyes
are disconcerting

  jess you-youre the goods jack
said thickly this will put me on my
feet ill save every possible nickel of
my salary and if i can last two years
therell be enough to come back with
and start some kind of a business jess

he added i know just about how that
bird in the old story pilgrims prog-
ress felt when that load fell off his
back i-i feel great

  good whitford laughed the
boys are giving a little party for you
in the dining room and after that well
see you off on the one twenty train
and know this old boy well all be
watching the tickers and well all be
pulling for you listen-whats that 
he cocked up an ear as a shrill cry came
floating up through the window

  extra extra tack allen gulls
star sold to the panthers extra
extra

  the manager turned with a grin to
the big pitcher who stood transfixed
like one caught in the magic spell of
exquisite music hows that for
speed whitford asked chuckling i
gave it out not a half hour ago

  its great allen exclaimed lets
go down and see the boys

  waiting for the elevator allen was
silent the thing that had happened to
him was too big too marvelous too
wonderful a thing that had not hap-
pened half a dozen times in the games
history a quirk of fear that it was
a joke a cruel dream kept recurring
still he knew he wasnt asleep and he
knew that jess whitford wouldnt lie
it must be so

  you wont be lonesome up there
jack whitford was saying you
know bob berry dont you the kid
thats burning up the big stuff this year 
hes from here you know i know it
to my sorrow had a chance to get
him but couldnt see it because he is
one of these slow-ball pitchers-no fast
one at all-and i never had much faith
in em so tom nolan got him and
cleaned up a nice pile when the kid went
to the panthers whitford made a
wry face at the recollection

  tom got seventy-five thousand for
him didnt he allen grinned as he
rubbed it in
bases full



  yes dang it he did i get a head-
ache every time i think of that young-
ster begging me to give him a chance
and me turning him down funny thing
happened just after he was sold benny
cartwright ever tell you of it 

  no cartwright and i dont talk
too much patter in his old sport sheet
about me being through and such rot
huh guess hell have to haul in his
horns now whitford said but that
hasnt anything to do with this story
about berry only a kid you know
but somewhere hed met cass yorkes
daughter flora old cass is worth
about a million and though he wasnt
much of anybody twenty years ago he
high hats the whole town now made
his money in coal and lumber

  yes i know all about cass yorke
allen cut in his voice vibrating with
deadly hatred

  whitford looked up in surprise his
gaze taking in the pitchers flushed face
and narrowed eyelids eh the man-
ager said what can-

  plenty but never mind-go on
allens tone refused to soften

  mystified the manager continued
well young berry fell head over heels
in love with flora-shes a beauty all
right-but when the old man heard of
it he kicked the lad out bodily and for-
bade flora going out to the games when
bobs team played here then last fall
nolan sold the kid to the panthers for
that long price and the newspapers
touting him from coast to coast natu-
rally swelled the youngsters sense of his
own importance a bit

  the upshot of it was whitford
continued he bearded old cass in his
den and demanded the right to see flora
swearing if the permission wasnt forth-
coming hed do it without permission
it seems the girl had been doing some
talking too and they had old cass in a
corner but hes a slippery customer
and it at last ended in a deal bob of
course thinks hes the best pitcher in

the world and yorke got him on that
by letting on he feared the boy was but
a flash in the pan the deal is the boy
must win twenty-five games for the
panthers this year if he fails he fades
out of the picture of course old cass
feels safe in that or did before the kid
stepped out and piled up ten victories
to three defeats

  however-the manager laughed as
the elevator stopped at their floor-ive
an idea he feels safe anyway since he
packed the girl off to europe with an
aunt to look after her even if bob
wins hell have a fine time getting to
the girl

   thats like cas yorke commented
allen bitterly as they shot downward
he couldnt play square nohow

chapter ii

under an iron heel

pntering the dining room allen

   and the manager were immediately
pounced upon by a score of excited ball
players congratulations and good
wishes came out in a perfect babble
old jack allen was decidedly popular

   the dinner and fun was at its height
when an interruption came

   a lady to see you sir she says its
very important a bell hop whispered
in allens ear

   what asked the ball player sur-
prised

  a lady sir and she says-

  who in blazes is she i-

  she gave no name sir just asked
me to tell you and to say it is urgent
she is middle-aged sir and rich i
should say

   all right tell her ill be out at once
as the boy vanished allen turned to his
teammates excuse me a minute boys
and hold up that yarn till i get back
somebody wants to see me

   in a quiet corner of the lobby allen
found her she rose to meet him and
her face flushed slightly as she held out


top-notch magazine

a hand half timorously as though fear-
ful he would refuse it with one look
recognition came to allen and his own
face paled

  you he exclaimed breathlessly
then coldly as he dropped her hand
he asked- why am i so honored
according to the society pages mrs
cass yorke is not in the habit of call-
ing on ball players

  an expression of pain crossed the
womans face her voice came low and
troubled please jack dont you
are justified i know you hate us of
course and with good cause but please
cant you believe i had nothing to do
with it i implored cass not to do
that awful thing but he would not listen
to me oh he is a hard man jack
perhaps i should not say this but it is
truth he thinks only of himself and
his horrible greed for money and power
even his daughter and i his wife are
ground beneath the iron heel of his pur-
pose

  ive found little joy in this mad
social whirl and flora hates it the
woman went on my old friends were
dear to me and i wanted to keep them
but could not jack the flower of my
life is gone it is past but my daugh-
ter is just coming into hers and now
he schemes out a future for her con-
sult her no so ive come to you
for help

  allen looked at her in wonder the
bitterness in her voice was genuine
enough but grace how-i dont

  oh yes i think you can she broke
in eagerly i read in to-nights papers
that you are going east to the panthers
again and by the way jack i thrilled
at the magnificence of it-going back
a hero again after eight years out of
the big leagues-but the thing is jack
you are going where bob berry is you
know him of course

  i know of him he replied

  well my daughter loves him really

and truly and i know he loves her
but-

  yes i know all about that too cass
wont have it remarked jack dryly

   thats it but not all of it she told
him cass has his eye on some vast
lumber interests over the border in
canada and hes preparing to sacrifice
flora to get them theres a flabby-
jowled watery-eyed englishman james
cuninghame who owns the timber and
having seen flora wants her too shes
in europe now by her fathers orders
in company with cuninghames sister
thats to get flora away from bob and
give cuninghame a chance to dazzle her
now when bob went to the big-

  yes ive heard about that-skip it
allen cut in

  oh you seem to know quite a bit
about us she commented well i
want bob to win that bargain i-ive
stood for a lot in the past twenty years
and ive got to the end of my rope cass
thought hed made a sure bet with that
boy but it begins to look as though the
lad could win if he does im going to
see that he gets a square deal if he
doesnt win-well my daughter isnt to
be sold to cuninghame anyway she
finished with a sudden flame in her
eyes

  good im sure for you there
grace but how can i help in this
ive often thought id never lift my
finger to help a yorke but well i be-
gin to see you werent a party to that
rotten deal of long ago

  thank you jack youre right
that deal is a scar on my heart and i
hated no one knows how much to come
to you with this but i had to i want
you to take care of bob for us-flora
and me hes just a boy jack a boy
like you were twenty years ago and
a boy needs a square deal my eyes
dim now when i think of what a crooked
deal did for you

  bob is a star just as you were she
went on the papers praise him the
bases full



great crowds idolize him and always
in the fringe of those around him lies
temptation and i know cass yorke
is not above putting ruin in the lads
way if he thought it necessary oh
but hes ruthless jack but the boy
must win you are older now and
wise you know the game and all that
goes with it jack will you look after
bob will you watch over him take
care of him bring him back to us the
victor thats all ive come to ask
jack her eyes were misty with plead-
ing her soft voice trembled with feel-
ing

   a half smile flitted over allens face
many a time he had pictured a situation
similar to this and thought out the blis-
tering things he would say but now
that the chance had come things seemed
different somehow the conditions did
not seem to fit too much of life lay
in the past and here were young lives
young hearts all tangled up the smile
faded away and grim resolution entered
the lines of his brown face

   yes grace for you and your daugh-
ter and for young bob berry ill do all
i can anyhow its one way of getting
even if we can win out but dont
count too much on it-twenty-five
games is a lot of em in the big time

  thank you jack it-it shames
me but it is wonderful to come back
after so many years and find the old
friends still true i wish you much
success in this late return to the big
leagues ill watch the scores and re-
joice when you win tears were roll-
ing down her cheeks when she turned
to leave and it was a sober ball player
that went back to the hilarity in the din-
ing room

chapter iii

tiie old master

in the big time the race was hot and

  growing hotter from being con-
sidered scarcely a contender when the
season opened the panthers had snarled

and scrapped and fought their way to
second place and were now right on the
heels of the green sox to whom every-
body had conceded a second pennant
it was the first week in july the sea-
sons halfway mark the spring beauties
had faded the early bloomers had been
killed off and now the steady straining
grind began to show where the real
strength of the league lay

   sport writers all over the circuit free-
ly predicted that the final struggle was
cast for the green sox and the pan-
thers the edge was given the sox be-
cause they were an older team the
panthers were a nervous fighting bunch
of youngsters with a world of punch
spirit and raw ability hut they lacked
the confidence and smoothness of the
green-hosed machine and knowing
that crafty old gil black had gone on
a hunt for a balance wheel a stabilizer
which accounted for the purchase of
jack allen who was a veteran when
he left the league eight years before

  the panthers were playing a series
with the green sox the fans were
keen for this meeting between the two
leaders and whooped it up in great style
for their favorites when the green sox
took the other team into camp easily in
the first game the stands were filled
early for the second contest and half
an hour before game time when the
pitchers came out to warm up the
throngs along the third-base line and
above and back of the visitors bench
noted an unusual activity among the
photographers young bob berry the
panther ace was one of the two wann-
ing up but the camera men seemed in-
terested in the other at length an old-
timer in a box just back of the panther
dugout recognized the stranger and let
forth a roar its old jack allen back
from the grave hi there jack

  instantly the subtle drama of it caught
the crowd for nearly a dozen years
the old master had been a favorite
around the circuit and now hundreds

more recognized the long loose-jointed
swing a storm of handclapping arose
burst beyond that into a cheer until the
whole throng took it up and a tremen-
dous ovation came rolling out of the
stands the old pitchers heart warmed
to the spectators they had been good
to him in the past and he was still re-
membered ah it was fine he doffed
his cap and when the sunlight gleamed
in his silvered hair the crowd cut loose
again

  give us the old zip ball jack they
pleaded show these bushers what a
fast ball really is old boy

  over in the box with a flock of boys
around him the old fan first to recognize
the returned star beckoned i want to
shake hands with you again allen he
said as jack came up and i want these
lads to shake hands with you theyre
my grandsons and ive often told em
about you never expected to see y ou
up here again but say old man id
just like to have these boys see that old
smoke ball i believe its written in the
records that you threw the fastest ball
that ever hit the big league

  glad to meet the boys-allen smiled
as he shook hands with the proud
youngsters-but i cant show them the
old fast one dont dare when a

mans past forty you know- the

doc tells me and i know its true if i
ever throw the smoke ball again im
done the old whip wont stand it
nope im a slow-ball artist now
boys

  too bad the old man said with real
disappointment but i tell you boys
he continued as the pitcher went back
he used to throw one you couldnt
see

  that afternoon jack allen went to
the hill and with consummate skill slow
lalled the raging green sox to death
beating them four to two and all
through the game old gil black sat with
his kid pitchers to point out the wizardry
of the old master

  watch him now black said he
isnt going to pitch another full game
cant stand it up here any more hes
here to finish games save games for us
but i wanted you to see just once at
least the greatest pitcher of them all in
action through nine innings

  allen immediately became the teams
hero he owned a quiet genial manner
that charmed and he had a way of giv-
ing advice without offense after din-
ner a dozen of the boys wanted to take
him to a theater but the old star shook
his head nope he said laughing
an old man has to have his rest you
know early he retired to his room

  half an hour later bob berry knocked
on the old pitchers door

  come in called allen

  wh-what-in blazes stammered
the youngster as he entered say old
man weve got a high-priced bird on
this club who does nothing else but rub
arms legs and backs whatre you do-
ing it for

  stripped to his waist old jack allen
sat on the edge of his bed rubbing his
right arm he grinned broadly no-
body else knows as well as i do where
the sore spots are and nobody else has
quite the patience i have for this job
you see bob the old whip is all thats
between me and the cold so im taking
care of it if i can make it last two
years more ill be set ive been foolish
a long time and now that the gods have
given me another chance im going to
use it right besides id rather black
didnt know how that game to-day hurt
me

  there was quiet pathos in the forty-
year-old player sitting there rubbing his
arm pathos in the admission he had
nothing saved and in the expressed hope
to last two more years young bob ber-
ry gloriously alive with each one of
his one hundred and eighty pounds vi-
brating strength felt it his heart went
out to the old star

  here berry said almost gruffly let
bases full



me rub that old wing-youll have the
other one sore i came in here to ask
you something and while we talk i can
rub acting instantly on the thought
the boy sat down on the bed and began
a vigorous massage of the tired muscles
i say-he grinned at the astonished
allen-how many times do you suppose
this old whip has swung out there in the
broiling sun

  dont know-allen grinned back-
but a lot of em

  i guess so berry agreed musingly
twenty years is a long time for a
pitcher to last

  too long allen told him save
your money bob he advised abruptly
hang on to it like a pup to a bone keep
away from the bright lights and in five
or six years youll be able to start in
some business while still young dont
for heavens sake do like i did its
fine of course to come back now and
hear the plaudits of the crowd but its
terrible to have to come back

  ive thought of that berry said
and thats something i wanted to talk
with you about you come from the
same town i do do you know css
yorke

  a black scowl settled over allens
face do i know him he growled
ill say i do theres nobody that
knows him any better hes to blame
for my being where i am to-day

  do you happen to know liis daugh-
ter berry asked tensely

  no a slow smile chased the scowl
from the old pitchers lined face cass
and i had quit speaking when she was
born but he added i know her
mother and a fine woman she is also
i know all about your affair there young
man and im here to help you all i can
hooray shouted berry i say
old top this is ripping great say
man im glad youre here were going
to be great friends i can see that right
now whoop la nows the accepted
time- lets begin laying plans

  nope allen said its your turn
on the hill to-morrow the thing is
youve got to win twenty-five games
somehow or other and its some job for
a kid up here-i know ill watch you
work to-morrow then if you like well
have a session after dinner and ill try
to polish up your style a bit you must
be pretty good but a youngster always
has some weaknesses and up here theyre
pretty wise once or twice around and
theyll get hep to you then-look out
but i know a few tricks myself so hold
your nerve lad and well win its time
somebody took a trick from cass
yorke

  berrys fingers slid down the old stars
arm to grasp his hand say youre a
brick old-timer and im for you strong
but would it be impertinent to wonder
what it is youve got against cass yorke
you seem to dislike him about as much
as i do

  no not impertinent allen replied
soberly ive got plenty against him
and maybe ill tell you-some day

chapter iv

staying under cover

the next afternoon bob berry did
his best but in spite of that and his
brilliant support the green sox beat him
five to four his rating then stood
eleven victories and four defeats four-
teen more games must somehow be won
and there remained but fourteen weeks
to do it in

  carefully that night he and jack allen
figured it out if nothing happened to
berry in the way of an injury and if
he didnt go stale he could probably get
into nineteen or twenty more games be-
fore the season closed not more than
five or six of those could he lose and be
triumphant over cass yorke looking
at it that way with the hardest part of
the long grind ahead the job took on
colossal proportions

  but you can do it boy you can do


top-notch magazine

it the old hurler encouraged i did
it three times up here of course it
would be easier with a good fast ball to
mix in but since we havent got it well
get along without and then he
plunged into an analysis of the game
pointing out specially the faults berry
had shown and then telling him how to
correct them

  within two weeks the two pitchers
became genuine pals old gil black was
delighted beyond measure and readily
consented to a change making them
roommates

  jack allen found berry an apt pupil
the young player was in deadly earnest
and labored with might and main to
master the fine points the old master
daily drilled him on those two weeks
with the panthers playing against weak-
er teams yielded three more victories
for the youngster from coast to coast
the papers proclaimed him the greatest
pitching find in years

  near the end of the third week berry
came bouncing into the room one night
in a state that approached ecstasy he
had won another game that day for one
thing but the real cause of the joy was
a letter that he fluttered before the old
hurlers eyes

  lookit gleefully cried the boy
another epistle from europe jack
old-timer its a dandy too listen
you old hard head ill read the last part
of it to you

  im listening allen told him grin-
ning

  youd better warned berry it
says ive good news bob ive found
an american club here that gets the
baseball returns from the states every-
day by cable all i have to do is ring
them up and i know every day just how
youre making out youre doing fine
bob dear and im sure you-were go-
ing to win my wont father be hop-
ping mad but maybe hell see the
light and show us hes a good sport
after all im so glad that old pitcher

is with you and glad too that hes
the right sort listen to him bob and
try to do what he tells you please give
him my best regards and my thanks for
his aid

  i wont read you the rest-it
wouldnt be good for calloused ears like
yours said the lad as a faint flush
tinged his cheeks a deeper color but
isnt she a brick fancy hunting up
a club where she can get the daily re-
turns 

  shes in love commented allen
dryly

  and so the days swung on summer
faded into golden september the
panthers and the green sox fought
tooth and nail with never more than a
game separating them skillfully old
gil black worked his boys and in the
ancient arm and cunning brain of jack
allen found a heroic helper some half
dozen games the old star saved by go-
ing in when the morale of the young-
sters seemed cracking he had a way
of standing on the hill and looking
around at them that almost by magic
smoothed out their ragged nerves and
held them up

  bob berry was setting a worlds rec-
ord for a young pitcher with every
game he appeared to gain confidence
and his nerve seemed made of iron
however watching over him like a
hawk old jack allen had seen signs and
secretly began to worry the strain was
telling on the young pitcher daily his
face grew leaner a little line appeared
between his eyes and allen knew he
wasnt sleeping well

  two weeks before the season closed
the panthers came home to finish on
their own field at that time berrys
record stood at twenty-three wins and
five defeats and allen going in fre-
quently as relief pitcher had piled up
a rating of eight wins with but two re-
verses under the faithful ministra-
tions of bob berry his arm was hold-
ing out well and for the first time in
bases full



years allen was really happy black
was delighted and promised him an even
better contract for the next season

  im all set bob the old star told
the young one two or three years
up here and ill have enough to start a
business sure believe me im saving
my dough now

  didnt you ever save any jack
yes replied the old pitcher sober-
ly the first two years i was up here
-twenty years ago-i did but some-
thing happened that-well about ruined
me

  can you tell me about it old boy
they were sitting on the edge of the
bed berry having just finished rubbing
the veteran pitchers arm

  allen laughed a little no he
said i guess i better not its all
over now and im coming out all right
a little late but ill get there

  the boy looked at him a bit wistfully
as the older man pulled on a bath robe
but the tale was locked behind tightly
shut lips

  there is something though i want
to tell you boy allen declared sudden-
ly as he came close and placed a hand on
each of berrys shoulders

  all right shoot im listening

  i will and youd better listen
weve got thirteen more games to
play youre due to work three pos-
sibly four of em youve got to win
two of those three or four now boy
keep your eye peeled cass yorke
hasnt struck a blow all summer but
dont for a minute think he doesnt
know just how you istand i dont
know how he intends to do it but hell
strike before youve rung up that last
game

  so look out allen went on stick
close to the hotel and near some of the
boys i dont think you drink but dont
take one now even if your favorite
brother offers it to you-somebody
might have put a pill into it dont
meet anybody dont see anybody just

remember theres a little american lady
across the briny deep all but holding her
breath for a certain cablegram that you
and i want to send in his earnestness
old jack nearly talked himself breath-
less

  egad jack i hadnt thought of
that but youre right thanks for
taking care of me old top ill stay
under cover

  the next day from over in the bull
pen jack allen watched berry work
against the weak lions the youngster
was very bad-ineffective and wild

  the old relief pitcher shook his head
cracking allen said to himself and
going stale at the same time and next
week the green sox come gravely
worried he continued warming up ex-
pecting every minute to be sent in to
relieve the younger man

  the panthers however were furious
to hold the one-game lead they had se-
cured they fielded like phantoms and
hit like demons it was a slam-bang
affair all the way through and in a
desperate rally in the ninth the pan-
thers put over the marker needed the
official scorer hung up game no  for
young bob berry one more-only
one-and victory would be his

  that night however old gil black
laid down the law berry he growled
youre going stale you stay in bed
to-morrow all day you dont work
again young man until next wednes-
day that will be the first game of the
final series with the green sox and i
want all four of those games mind
what i say he added and do as i
tell you

  good lord berry exclaimed to
allen in their room later you heard
what he said ive got just one chance
left and thats against the green sox
thats enough lad get some rest
and get ready to put it over

  for three days bob berry remained
away from the ball park allen saw to
it that he got a daily dip in the ocean


top-notch magazine

and a brisk walk through the park
also the old-time nioundsman took the
lad down in the hotel court and gave
him light throwing practice to keep his
control in line and prevent stiffening of
the arm tuesday lie went to the ball
park and had a good workout

chapter v

before game time

vednesday in high feather and
full of confidence berry started
against the slugging never-quitting
green sox who had dropped two con-
tests the week before and were now
three games behind the panthers but
were still fighting

  for three innings berry hurled bril-
liantly not a man reached first base
in the fourth two singles and a stolen
base brought in a green sox run in
the fifth the young star blew up and
before red haven blacks only real
fast-ball pitcher could get in to stop it
six runs had pattered over haven
toiled like a giant and the panthers
fought like their namesake but to no
avail the game was lost seven to
six

  that night berry flung himself onto
the bed and would not go down to
dinner ive lost jack ive lost
he exclaimed when his roommate
came in

  the old-timer did not reply but
walked over to the bed grasped berry
by the shoulders and yanked him to a
sitting position what are you acting
like this for are you a quitter he
asked sternly

  no im not the other cried blaz-
ingly but ive had my chance havent
i  i blew it didnt i  black is no
fool-he wont start me again i-

  get down there and eat and then get
back up here ordered old jack allen
i promised floras mother to bring
you home a winner if it was possible
and i dont propose to slip  the last

game who in blazes is going to pitch
these last three set-tos red haven is
out of it now ash will work to-
morrow  curry the next day and that
leaves whom for saturday

  you know theres nobody else
allen went on the boss wouldnt
trust me nor dixon and certainly
none of the youngsters except-yourself
unless of course ash or dixie should
come through and we dont need that
last game in that case hed use you
anyhow because he wants to give you
all the big-game experience he can

  the truth is however i think well
need that game and need it badly
allen continued the green sox are
all primed for slow-ball fiingers and
thats about all weve got but perk
up now boy and get ready for satur-
day you blew to-days chance higher
than a kite but youll be just about ripe
for game no  saturday

  without a word chiefly because he
couldnt utter one berry grabbed old
jack allens hand then made quickly
for the elevator

  when bob berry cracked in the first
game something happened to gil blacks
young team thursday tom ash
pitched like a hero but the panthers
could not hit and went down to a two-
to-nothing defeat friday after a sear-
ing lecture by old gil they did better-
they scored a run the green sox
however got three off curry

  so saturday came with the two
teams tied in the pennant race and the
panthers in a slump

  one thing continued to puzzle jack
allen-nowhere had the hand of cass
yorke appeared it may be he
thought that yorke figures bob is
licked if thats it then hell be caught
flat-footed if the kid starts to-days
game

  on arriving at the park the manager
called allen to one side frankly
jack im puzzled he said im in
a hole of course and the green sox
bases full



know it as well as you or i do id
send haven back in to-day but he
lamed his arm wednesday ill have
another fast-ball pitcher next season if
i have to mortgage the club to get him
but without speed i guess itll have to
be brains hows your arm old boy
he asked suddenly do you think
you could go in there and get away
with it

  thanks gil for the compliment
the old star said soberly id like to
and maybe i could get by but trying it
wouldnt seem good judgment to me
listen chief-start bob i give you
my word hes ready ive been working
with him and hes your best bet hes
beaten them three times this season and
i think he can win to-day ill be ready
to go if he wabbles

  old gil black searched his advisers
face for a long time at last he said
all right well see how he warms up
but you get ready jack

  ten minutes before game time
catcher steve hart reported to the man-
ager hes got everything to-day
boss everything send him in-hes
right

chapter vi

to the last man

hpen thousand fans were turned away
from the panthers park that day
because there was no place for them
the stands had already overflowed to
fringe the playing field with a shouting
screaming bank of humanity the ex-
citement was tense and the feeling was
terrific

  never had the league race ended in
such dramatic fashion and the crowd
was making the most of it had they
known the full story of young bob
berry whom they now were cheering to
the echo there is no telling what their
hero worship and enthusiam might have
led them into

  only one man on the field other than
berry knew that story and he was

down in the bull pen with a catcher
lobbing a ball ceaselessly back and forth
keeping himself warm and ready should
the youngster waver now and then
he turned for a moment to watch the
boy and smiled on these occasions
those close enough heard the old relief
pitcher mutter over and over go it
bob go it boy youve got em

  and what a battle it was the green
sox all of them veterans played with
that steady brilliance that easy assur-
ance that comes to men who have often
experienced critical moments and in con-
sequence learned to control their nerves
however the panthers nearly all
youngsters quivered like leashed
hounds they ran like startled deer
they flung themselves at every batted
ball as though life itself depended on
getting it they made errors but in
the next moment some seemingly im-
possible play wiped the errors out

  in the sixth with neither team hav-
ing a run tiny vincent panther left
fielder worked the green sox hurler
into a hole instantly the clatter in the
stands died down some unseen force
seemed suddenly to make the vast
throng aware of a moment hung heavy
with drama and the next instant it
happened crack vincent had leaned
against the ball and it was speeding far
over the wall in right center there
were those who declared solemnly that
that roof on the stands rose a foot then
and down in the bull pen an old star
smiled quietly as he rubbed the muscles
of his shoulder

  as so often happens in a tight game
however the scoring of a run seems to
break a cord in the defense of the lucky
team often it apparently has some
peculiar effect on the pitcher it may
be that he loses some of his effective-
ness or perhaps the other team is driven
to greater effort at any rate in the
seventh the green sox got three clean
hits and only the most spectacular field-
ing behind berry prevented the score


top-notch magazine

from being tied grimly jack allen
watched and when the last out was
made dropped his ball and ran for the
bench

  the boys slipping nows the time
to tell him he exclaimed as he ran

  under pretense of rubbing berrys
arm allen pulled the lad to one end
of the dugout and as he rubbed whis-
pered in his ear bob youve got em
licked youve won a wife and youve
licked old cass yorke too listen
sharp now im going to tell you what
that old pirate did to me if youre the
friend i think you are it will help you
through the last two innings

  go on im all ears jack

  twenty years ago cass yorke and
i were friends he was older than i
and i thought him a prince i trusted
him neither of us had anything but
i was a ball player and coming to the
big league still i knew that was good
for only a few years so cass and i
planned a business-the business he
now has i was to play ball and turn in
my money he was to stay home and
build the business when it got big
enough i was to quit the game and
the two of us would work on our
dream

  well for two years i turned in
every cent i made allen went on
for two years he took it and lied to
me then at last suspecting something
and demanding a show-down i learned
of his thieving crookedness the busi-
ness was booming but-i wasnt in the
company cass yorke had built it on
my money and then incorporated the
whole thing in his own name

  i was out and did not have a scrap
of paper to prove my position allen
continued it did something to me
bob discouraged me broke my faith
he stole more than money too but
theres no need to talk about that now
i drifted along and played ball till now
im past forty but right at this time
youve got a chance to square me a little

im counting on you get in there now
and do it will you

  berry reached and grabbed old jack
allens hand the younger mans voice
was husky the beastly thief yes
ill beat these birds you bet lead me
to em

  in the eighth not a green sox player
got to first the score remained one to
nothing young bob berry showed
such cool determined mastery that even
the cloud raised from the brow of old
gil black and still the blow from
cass yorke had not fallen down in
the bull pen methodically tossing a ball
jack allen was wondering why

  no ball game however is over until
the last man is out in the ninth and
with the score one to nothing nobody
feels safe or beaten until that hap-
pens

  as the panthers left their bench for
the field to start the final inning a tele-
graph messenger came bursting out of
the club entrance and at the same time
a grizzled man sitting with a young girl
in the stands his eyes fastened on that
door smiled evilly and leaned back with
a sigh

  bob berry called the messenger
wheres bob berry

  the catcher indicated the player
wanted and the messenger ran over to
him

  cablegram sir the boy said and
handed over the envelope

  a smile lighted up berrys face and
his heart jumped game little sport
he muttered as he ripped open the mes-
sage shes trying to help me then
the crimson drained away from his face
leaving the tan a dead gray he shiv-
ered as with cold and his eyes blinked
his fingers seemed to numb and the
message slipped from them

  any answer queried the mes-
senger

 answer-answer heaven no
theres no answer berry said as he
picked up the paper stuffed it in his
bases full



shirt pocket and with unseeing eyes
started toward the mound

chapter vii

as the world grew black

the first green sox player walked on
four straight balls the crowd
groaned and the catcher went out to
talk to bob berry the next batter
spanked a single to center on the first
ball pitched the man on first scooted to
third old gil black stood up in the dug-
out and chewed the end off his pencil
the green sox bench resembled a bee-
hive and the coachers were yelling like
madmen jack allen his brow deeply
wrinkled had come in from the bull
pen

  when the sonorous voice of the um-
pire rolled out ball three on the next
batter black jerked his thumb at berry
and roared to allen at the same time
get in there jack the kids done
its up to you

at the first-base line the two met

  whats the matter bob snapped
allen

  no use old boy that cablegram
was from flora she-shes married
jack married that cuninghame

  the world grew black for allen for
just an instant then a clear white light
struck through a rage that mounted
and blinded took possession of him
its a lie bob a contemptible rotten
lie and youre a blithering idiot for
falling for it cass yorke did that to
beat you hes struck at last and it
looks as though hes won tragic
bitterness rang in the old stars
voice

  wild dazzling hope sprang up in
bob berry however youre right
jack by all thats holy you must be
right oh what a blind fool i am go
in there old boy and save this for me
you can do it jack the game is still
mine if they dont score hold em
jack-hold em for me for a long

while afterward thirty thousand fans
wondered what was said in that moment
when the old star stood on the base line
with his arm across the shoulders of the
youngster

  slowly allen walked out to the box
he took his famous look around and
his practice pitches to the plate

  play ball roared the umpire and
the game was on again

  the first pitch was a slow curve
ball four cried the official

  bases full none down a pennant and
the happiness of two young people hang-
ing in the balance old jack allen
knew that he must work carefully on
the next man

  the next effort was a slow floater
whang the ball went sailing over the
distant right-field wall and three run-
ners started for home

  foul ball bellowed the umpire
and the fans breathed again

  allen next tried a curve crack
this time the ball went to left field
foul by inches two strikes

  lord if i can make him miss one
allen thought

  however the next ball the batter
straightened out it went like a streak
for center

  shorty davis second baseman
took two steps made a wild leap and
speared the ball again the roof of the
stands seemed to rise although with
the enemy runners taking no chances
a double play did not result in the
dugout an inarticulate noise broke from
bob berrys lips

  thanks shorty allen grinned at
davis

  stick em in there jack yelled the
second baseman were set now
theyll have to knock our hands off
to get one through

  when however the next batter hit
two long fouls in a row over the right-
field stands allen became worried
he knew the green sox had solved his
slow balls and he knew what was


top-notch magazine

needed speed  but that he dared not
use there were those two years yet
and the business that would take care
of him when at last his arm quit after
all if the sox did score the panthers
had another chance and might win

  as his foot dropped into place on the
rubber and he stretched out his long
arms preparatory for the next pitch his
eyes went to the bench on the far end
of it alone allen saw bob berry
hunched over with his face hidden in
his hands and the old-time star knew
the young pitcher was waiting for the
bat crack that would spell defeat
something gripped the old hurlers
heart a great pity and sympathy al-
most paternal rose in him for the lad
and in the instant he knew the sacrifice
must be made a look at once resigna-
tion and determination swept over his
face as allen signaled to the catcher
and ran up to meet him

  look out now and hang on to em
allen ordered sharply when they met
im going to show you fast balls you
never saw before therell be a hop
on em so dont let em get away
right the catcher grinned
steam em in-ill get em

  using the same old style allen
wound up the batter set himself for
a slow one then the lanky form on
the hill unlimbered like a coiled spring
the long arm whirled like a flash the
body lunged and followed through
whiz-bang like a gleaming leap-
ing streak the ball shot into the big
mitt and the man behind the mask
rocked back on his heels

  strike three youre out boomed
the umpire as his right thumb snapped
up

  the batter looked dazed he hadnt
even swung the stands were silent
a moment and then an old man in a
front box roared

  hurrah old jack has found his fast
one

  the crowd sensed it then the drama

of it and a cheer that shook the flag-
pole went zooming across the field
none saw the spasm of pain that
crossed the old stars face two
down

  look out warned the man just re-
tired as he met the next batter coming
up its the fastest ball you ever saw
and a wicked hop on it

  in the dugout bob berry was staring
wide-eyed and but half of old gil
blacks pencil was left

  tight lipped jack allen wound up
for the next pitch zip like a living
thing the ball sped to the catchers mitt

  strike one shouted the umpire
himself amazed as the batter picked
himself up having fallen as the result
of his fearful swing which missed by
a foot

  thirty thousand fans were on their
feet now pleading for that strike-out
the din was terrific on the mound
jack allens teeth were shut till the
muscles in each jaw stood out in lumps

  once more he wound up the fielders
set themselves the base runners scur-
ried along the lines again the long
form unlimbered and the ball sped like
a darting shadow plateward the bat-
ter did not swing

   strike two roared the umpire his
own heart pounding in admiration for
the old player out there who the world
said could pitch only with his head

  the crowd was silent now breath-
less almost one more could he do
it again over in the dugout old gil
black was tense speechless bob berry
was standing on the edge of the steps
the small colored mascot was wildly
kissing a rabbits foot the world it
seemed stood still waiting for that
last ball as slowly old jack allen
wound up

  none heard the groan that escaped
him as his arm rose above his head and
a searing agony went shooting from
shoulder to wrist but mind still mas-
tered his body folded up and straight-
bases full



ened the old arm swung halfway
over though something snapped the
power faded out and thirty thousand
hypnotized fans gasped to see him fall
forward on his face as the ball left his
fingers

  the batter saw - coming set himself
and swung swish the catcher gal-
vanized to action lunged forward and
caught the falling ball just off the
ground behind the plate

  strike three youre out cried the
umpire but nobody heard him

  the game was over the pennant won
and the fans came pouring onto the field
amid a veritable rain of cushions hats
and score cards out on the diamond
the excited panther team rushed in to
pick up and protect old jack allen who
still sat on the ground where he had
fallen

chapter viii

something filmy

a master stroke jack old gil
black cried later in the clubhouse
thats where brains come in he
was looking for a fast one and that
slow one caught him flat but why in
thunder did you fall down

  a far-away look came into the old
pitchers eyes then he smiled sadly
couldnt help it gil lie said simply
here help me put my coat on will
you i saved your old pennant for
you but youll have to tackle the worlds
series without me-im done

  maybe for the series but well have
that old souper in shape for next year
jack old boy the manager said

  the old star smiled however he
knew better the arm had quit

  as he waited for bob berry the old
pitcher fell to wondering a bit what
the future held in store for him now
oh ill get a job somewhere selling
cars or something he thought it
doesnt matter much

  at that instant young bob berry

wild disheveled and almost incoherent
came bursting out of the office jack
jack he cried shes here floras
here she-she saw the game ran
away and came home but of course her
aunt cabled and old cass met her then
she made him bring her out here to the
game he-he sent that cable just as
you said-it was a fake-but come 
in and let her tell it

  jack allen knew the gray-eyed dark-
haired girl instantly in her fresh clear
beauty she was a picture of what her
mother had looked like twenty years be-
fore

  when i explained to dad that bob
gets credit for winning the game even
if you did finish it mr allen he was
furious and made quite a scene in the
stand hes a poor sport i guess be-
cause he said i couldnt marry bob any-
way well that riled me a bit and i
said i was coming down here to see bob
and you he tried to stop me but my
some men up in the stands carried him
off goodness how he kicked and
yelled but here i am

  and from here berry put in
were going to the marriage-license

place and from there-

  youll go with us wont you mr
allen you helped us win and we
want you the girl interrupted blush-
ing

  sure ill go the old ball player
said with a chuckle if-youll call me
jack

  its a bargain and now jack
theres something else i want to say
i know what it cost you to do what you
did to-day your career is done what
are you going to do now

  oh ill find something maybe my
arm will come back next year he
added carelessly

  you know better than that the girl
declared now see here i know your
story i know what father did to you
lets make that right i know some-
thing about the coal-and-lumber busi-


top-notch magazine

ness  lets start another company bob
can play ball for a year or two and put
in his money you and i will stay home
and run the business and well soon be
successful what say jack

  something seemed to tangle up the

old ball players vocal cords and some-
thing filmy got into his eyes but he
at last managed to say sure kids
im game well do it shucks he
mumbled as he reached for his hand-
kerchief whats the matter with me

 that foolish flamingo

   by clarence mansfield lindsay

       vnce i had a pet flamingo
       evrywhere i went
       that strange bird went too by jingo

       all its time it spent
       in my company and never
       was it out of sight

       but like marys lamb was ever
       with me day and night

       now i like a pet flamingo

       with its corkscrew neck

       still its uncouth ways and lingo
       pall on one by heck

       and i do not greatly fancy
       being trailed each day
       by a foolish bird which cant see
       when its in the way

      so one morn i up and traded
      that ungainly fowl
      for a beautifully shaded

      hoot-or great horned-owl
      now wheneer i walk or ride its
      always by myself

iith one easy glance steve
simpson star salesman for
the impregnable safe corpo-
ration of new york encom-
passed the entirety of still
creek junction vermont the village
snored beside a saffron road from
the star drug store came the drowsy
rrrrr of an electric fan and on the step
of the bargain meat market a slum-
bering bird dog twitched one ear feebly
under the droning of a fly no other
sign of life was detectable all about
lay dust-browned hills like bubbles in
a steaming pie-crust

  industrious place steve simpson
observed laconically

  he entered the dry goods empo-
rium a sifting of dust covered the
shelves a solitary salesgirl was dozing
with head on curled arm at the front
counter simpson strode to an office
in the rear where a pen was stuttering
at a sheet of paper

  afternoon sir he greeted breezily
the man inside giving his brief case a
hitch youre the proprietor of this
busy store arent you i can tell by
the air of an executive about you

that-

  the proprietors lock of rusty hair
dangling over one eye and his corru-
gated neck made him look astonishingly

like a turkey the uncovered eye
blinked at simpson

  nice little city youve got here the
salesman said with a flourish whos
the mayor

  im presdent of the board of select-
men the proprietor answered potts
my name

  zat so good roads leading in
too-

  im chairman of the county roads
commission my names pott

  congratulations quite a neat little
school you have down near the hotel
and-

  yep said the turkey im prin-
cipal pott-my names pott

  hm observed simpson thought-
fully is the justice of the peace named
pott too

  yep a whiteness appeared be-
tween the proprietors lined lips
it is

  well im honored to know you
sir simpson beamed getting to busi-
ness a man with as many respon-
sibilities as you probably worries under
the weight of them and you cant
afford to worry-youve got to keep that
big mind of yours clear safety first
always-you know that you cant do
business well if youre not sure of the
safety of your papers and securities


top-notch magazine

now the impregnable safe corpora-
tion is putting out a new-

  dont need a new safe interrupted
the school principal justice of the peace
and the holder of other honors

  were putting out a new model
which is small and more compact than
anything else ever offered to the market
just look at these photographs mr
pott-your names pott isnt it just
look at the beauty mr pott of those
safes arent they something youd be
proud to put into this well-furnished
office and the impregnable guarantee
is back of every one

  i dont need a new safe repeated
the thin man his rusty forelock flicking
with a nod of his head the old one
is good enough

  simpson turned critical eyes on the
steel box sitting in the corner the
dial of it was corroded the enamel was
chipped off and the exposed steel was
freckled with rust one of the casters
was missing for which half a brick was
doing substitution service

  shes served me well pott stated
proudly ever since i got er in 
good lord you mean its forty-
six years old and still you dare to
use it simpson looked pained mr
pott youre giving yourself unnecessary
risks why some day a tramp will
come along and open that thing with a
toothpick and walk away with all your
money well he could do it with a
can opener anyway why nothing
could keep a real crook out of that box
-except maybe hed laugh himself to
death at sight of it

  i guess you didnt hear me say a
stern justice-of-the-peace tone inter-
rupted i dont want a new safe

 but mr-er-er-

  pott said pott implacably

  pott went on simpson compress-
ing a smile from his lips you could
get as much protection from a ten-cent-
store cake box now the new model

impregnable is offered on easy terms
and-

   pott sat straight and said with nods
that sent his lock of hair swinging over
-his eye with each word b glory i
dont-need-a-new-safe good
day

   as i was saying the new model will
make it a pleasure to purchase because
the amount-

  a sound came from potts throat
that was uncommonly like an angry
gobble

  simpson waved one hand dismissing-
ly all right very well as you say
youve made your judgment this part
of the country must be thick with
tramps because of the railroad junction
but if one of them kicks that toy of
yours apart dont blame anybody but
yourself with an air of righteousness
he rose well ill say good day mr
watt-

   pott corrected the chairman of the
county roads commission severely
good day

ii

omiling simpson walked into the
languid street his bearing as he
made his way toward his hotel was not
despondent he was not worried by
potts resistance he was confident in
fact he had a system of his own that
worked his method had actually put
him at the head of the list of the im-
pregnables sales force and he was
prepared to employ his effective scheme
on the estimable pott principal of the
school justice of the peace and what
not

   as though his business in still creek
junction was closed simpson took the
next train for the near-by town of green
valley there he called upon several
merchants recited his sales talk glibly
and succeeded in selling a small order
that evening before retiring he hired
an automobile from the valley garage
-leaving a suitable deposit-took a re-
the man who ran the town



freshing spin into the hills then parked
the car conveniently beside his hotel

  he went to his room after the town
was asleep he raised his window toed
down the fire escape dropped silently to
the ground and stirred the motor of
the car he sent it purring over the
highway through the blackness toward
still creek junction

  half a mile out of the village he
parked in a weeded side road and went
ahead on foot carrying a canvas-cased
tool kit under his arm

  still creek junction was more than
still the night was so vacant that even
the darkness was audible as an all-
pervading hum not even the wind
stirred the weeds along the edges of
the paths simpson picked his way gin-
gerly and silently through the rank
growths and paused at the rear of the
dry goods emporium

  from his black kit he took a jimmy
only a slight pressure was necessary to
snap the rusted lock on the rear window
he waited a long time and when no
alarm came he told himself this is
too easy

  he legged himself in the interior
of the emporium was solid blackness
simpson switched on his blue-lensed
hand lamp guided by the sepulchral
glow he circled to the partitioned office
the door was unlocked

  the safe sat sheepishly in the corner
the rusted dial turned with reluctance
the door rattled in its setting

  simpson smirked i could open
you he told the thing with a good
hard sneeze

  actually he used a hammer one
well-placed blow silcnced by an old felt
hat which he had brought knocked the
dial off another deft swing drove the
pin inward then simpsons nimble
fingers reached inside the hole and
moved the tumblers the door swung
open with a discouraged creak

  simpsons blued light showed a packet
of currency lying neatly inside he

slipped the money into his pocket sev-
eral negotiable bonds followed the bills
to his person various civic papers he
scattered about the office then he
backed away

  his blue light played over the floor
carefully as he made sure that he had
left no telltale marks lie dropped the
old felt hat as a plant to dupe the pro-
prietor into thinking a tramp had broken
the safe gathering his tools he
rubbed his footprints from the dust
then he went through the window and
moved into the darkness

  taking lollypops from a kid is hard
work compared to this he told himself
gleefully

  simpson found his car aroused it
and slid back over the road to his hotel
leaving the auto he swung himself
onto the fire escape he glided up and
silently dropped into his room

  he counted the money and bonds he
had stolen good lord he ex-
claimed

  the securities were of five hundred
dollars each and the bills amounted to
forty-odd dollars

  all this money in that tomato can
the boob

  he dropped the loot into a concealed
pocket in the lining of his traveling bag
and pronounced the nights work good
he tucked himself into bed with a feel-
ing of contentment

iii

vi ext morning simpson proceeded
on his route as though nothing out
of the ordinary had occurred a day
later he told himself

  to-morrow ill go back to pott and
just walk in and get that order the
old man will certainly want a new safe
now

  whenever simpson met a particularly
tough customer he employed the un-
usual device of blowing the old safe
and later taking the order for a new


top-notch magazine

one not only did he avoid suspicion
but he actually won the buyers grati-
tude for happily providing them with
needed protection being careful not to
overdo the thing he achieved an en-
viable total of commissions to add to
his loot success was his doubly

  two thousand dollars it was a
plump little haul from mr pott simp-
son chuckled over it with the heartless-
ness of a born crook he did not stop to
consider the immensity of the loss to
the turkeylike man during simpsons
double-dealing career his burglaries had
thrown one little store in massachusetts
into bankruptcy he had deprived an-
other retailer in new hampshire of his
life savings in vermont he had robbed
a young fellow of his cherished dream
of college by stealing the painfully ac-
cumulated funds over these as over
the robbery of pott steve simpson
gloated

  i didnt leave a trace he told him-
self they cant possibly get me be-
sides these hick-town cops dont know
theyre alive

  simpson caught the morning train
which by afternoon dropped him again
into the deserted junction village in
vermont the street was torpid as
before the salesgirl inside the em-
porium was dozing against the counter
simpson swaggered into the partitioned-
oif room in the rear the proprietor
slumped in his chair looked up with the
lock of hair dangling before one dulled
eye

  afternoon simpson said breezily
well strange things happen mr-er
-port-

  pott corrected the turkeylike store-
keeper

  lucky for you i was able to come
back simpson told him now youve
learned your lesson and it meant some-
thing to you you wouldnt listen to
me if you had ordered a safe when i
advised it youd still have your bonds
now youve lost a lot of money one

of the tramps did it of course and
you certainly need a new safe now

iv

together the two men looked at
the wrecked safe in the corner
simpson triumphantly pott sadly

  she was a good safe said the pro-
prietor while she lasted

  now mr pott how about a new
model impregnable-or will you be in-
terested in a little stronger type  simp-
son asked leaning across the desk

  potts eyelid lowered behind his lock
of hair

  oh dont be discouraged simpson
cheered him a good safe is a good
investment youll be perfectly secure
from anything like this ever happening
again just sign right here-on the

dotted line and-

  whered you hear about the rob-
bery pott interrupted his lean hands
fishing in a drawer of his desk

  oh its all over of course simp-
son answered broadly a salesman
who came through here told me about
it it certainly is fortunate i stayed so
close

  yep said pott it certainly is
his hands reappeared suddenly click
-click

  simpsons eyes widened two shin-
ing handcuffs were coolly locked around
his wrists what-whats this
you robbed that safe of mine your-
self pott declared no tramp did it
even though that hat was left by the
ruins you did it

  thats a lie-you cant prove it
you didnt find any clew

  nope nary a clew did i find there
wasnt any left but you did it you
crook

  you cant prove it you didnt sec
me-nobody saw me

  thats right-nobody saw you but
i know you did it

    lhen noah went a-sailing with his zoo

            he was forty days and nights upon the foam

     and he had to send a bird to report on what occurred
       in the weeks when he was far away from home

     times have altered for the better since that biblical adventure

as i think you will not censure me for saying

    now at sea thanks to me and my palpitating key

       youre in touch with home no matter where youre straying

    when a mad typhoon comes loping down the sky

and the ship acquires a bucking-broncho reel

     and you feel somewhat suspicious that the avaricious fishes
       may he waiting round to use you for a meal

     when the combers rake the crows nest and the boats are spat to hinders
       and your chances seem not worth a thin piaster

     yet the chronicles dramatic that we send through storm and static
       arent a patch to the adventures that we live
having beea successful in a search for
platinum in a south american mountain
range jack sadler a young man from the
states and a swede named larson were seized
with fever in the lowlands drifting along a
rain-swollen river in their canoe they were
closely pursued by bands of natives bent upon
robbery during a tremendous rainstorm and
under the cover of darkness sadler and lar-
son left their canoe and struggled through the
jungle toward some lights in the distance

  the lights were in the residence of frank-
lin tremaine a californian who with his
daughter dale and ralph maxwell had come
to south america to dredge for platinum
he had obtained as security a concession
and a dredger from howard bettincourt a
prospector to whom tremaine had lent a vast
sum of money later tremaine heard that
bettincourt had been drowned ralph max-
well to whom dale tremaine seemed to be
informally engaged was the dredging super-
intendent

  sadler and larson after reaching the tre-
maine residence recovered slowly from the
remorseless fever which had attacked them
sadler soon found out that all was not well
with the company which tremaine had
formed little work was done maxwell re-
fusing to carry on operations unless the
weather was clear maxwell clearly disliked
the presence of sadler about the property

  one night when sadler and larson were
nearly recovered from the fever a terrific
storm broke causing a rise in the river along

the bank of which tremaines dredger was
moored under maxwells direction the men
tried to get additional lines out to tho boat
but the effort failed it seemed that the
dredger would be lost then after sadler had
taken charge it was at last saved

  maxwell angered at the others success
hinted to dale tremaine that sadler was stay-
ing in the south american jungle because he
did not dare return to the states the girl
rebuked maxwell for the remark

  sadler felt that a strange mystery pervaded
the affairs of the tremaines because he knew
that contrary to what franklin tremaine evi-
dently believed howard bettincourt was still
alive

chapter x

the deep mystery

omehow jack sadler was
greatly puzzled by dale tre-
maines explanation of how
lllliyil her father got possession of
the dredger and the conces-
sion from the colombian govern-
ment to work the river howard
bettincourt soldier of fortune and
neer-do-well was alive at least he
had been alive a few weeks before and
there was no reason for believing that
he was not alive at that minute
rogues of the jungle



  well lars how do you explain it
sadler asked the swede larson as
they were slipping out of their clothes

  i aint trying to lars said still
grinning it aint none o my busi-
ness

  now listen lars its all right to
talk that way about an ordinary mat-
ter but this is something out of the
ordinary something unusual

  yes lars admitted with a wise nod
of his head shes unusual purty girl

  sadler colored swiftly and to hide his
eonfusion hurled a shoe at the swede
he missed his mark deliberately of
course and then stooped down to un-
lace the other shoe

  never mind miss tremaine
sadler growled well just leave her
out of it as near as i can figure shes
engaged to marry maxwell anyway
at least i saw her kiss him when i
went by their house this morning

  larsons round good-natured face
darkened i dont like dat he said
slowly dat faller maxwell is no
good

  oh well lars we dont know any-
thing about that the fellow may be a
dccent-enough sort of course he
doesnt know any too much about
dredgers but we cant hold that against
him how though do you explain this
other thing here bettincourt ropes
old man tremaine into putting up the
money for this dredger and for building
this camp in return probably he gives
him an interest in the proposition and
puts up his concession on the river and
the whole business as security for the
money

  then bettincourt disappears is sup-
posed to be drowned and the old man
is forced to come here and take over
the show to protect his investment
sadler went on now we corato the
mystery why did bettincourtdisap-
pear  he wasnt kidnaped or any-
thing like that he isnt suffering from
aphasia or loss of memory i know that

because although he tried to avoid me
up there in condoto i cornered him
and made him pay me a months back
wages that had been due me for several
years whats his game

  crooked whatever it is lars de-
creed

  of course thats bettincourt for
you one of the biggest scoundrels this
side of the canal but what has he got
up his sleeve the concession that he
turned over to tremaine by appearing
to get drowned is one of the most
valuable in the country i know that
he and the choco metals and half a
dozen other mining companies have
been trying for years to get hold of it
bettincourt beat them by playing dirty
politics but he got clear title to the con-
cession

  now why with an outfit like this
at his disposal with nothing to do but
assemble the dredger and go to work
did he pass out of the picture sadler
continued what has he got up his
sleeve

  the swede grinned wisely i think
when we get to buena ventura in a few
days from now he said in a matter-of-
fact tone that we ought to buy that
little tuglxjat we was talkin bout
thats good liddle craft an tugboat
business is good business for-

  sadler hurled the other shoe and
rolled into bed you make me sick
lars he exclaimed youve got
about as much curiosity as a mud turtle
im going to sleep

  however despite his best intentions
sadler did not fall asleep for an hour
or more there were so many things
that puzzled him there were so many
things that he wanted to have explained
-if for no other reason than to satisfy
his curiosity-that he could not forbear
going over them and the more he
thought about the situation the more
bewildered he became

  there was ralph maxwell for in-
stance what part was the good-look-


top-notch magazine

ing young superintendent playing other
than that of openly wooing dale tre-
maine  sadler felt certain that the man
had other irons in the fire besides the
mere task of getting the dredger in
operation his delaying of the work
on account of rains his crude handling
of the boat in the storm the night be-
fore his general inefficiency which
sadler had noted on more than one oc-
casion-these things seemed to point
toward the conclusion that maxwell had
some ulterior motive in slowing up the
work either that or he was a fool
and cordially hating the man sadler
inclined toward the former hypothesis

  then there was the choco metals
corporation with its two boats a mile
down the capistrano-and with jose
gonzales in charge of them gonzales
of the smooth manner and the disarm-
ing smile who could make love to an-
other mans wife or stab a business rival
in the back with equal facility a nice
man to have for a neighbor on a job
like this

  dale tremaine had said that he had
gone out of his way to help them on
several occasions gonzales would of
course that was the way he played
the game of business-and of love
sadler writhed it was a nice situation
he told himself bitterly an old man
unschooled in the dark ways of the
choco trying to work one of the most
valuable platinum properties in the dis-
trict and a young girl as charming
and beautiful as any woman sadler had
ever met accepting favors from that
yellow greaser gonzales

  then there was bettincourt abandon-
ing a valuable property which he had
been fighting for years to acquire al-
lowing it to revert to tremaine without
five cents in payment looking back-
ward sadler could read bettincourts
plans as clearly as though they were
written before him bettincourt never
had any cash he got hold of tremaine
in some way and induced him to finance

the purchase of the boat and the build-
ing of the camp intending to freeze him
out as soon as he had squeezed him dry

  for some unfathomable reason how-
ever bettincourt had changed his plans
and had caused to be circulated a rumor
to the effect that he had been drowned
instead of freezing out tremaine as he
had most assuredly planned in the first
place he had deliberately frozen out
himself and the reason

  sadler tried to force the problem out
of his mind after all as lars took so
much pains to impress upon him it was
none of his business still he felt sorry
for tremaine-good-hearted old duffer
-didnt have a chance fighting these

cutthroats of the choco- and dale

was in love with maxwell-and was
very beautiful-and was accepting fa-
vors from gonzales-and was very
lovable- oh well-oh well

chapter xi

a suspicious move

the following afternoon sadler was
sitting on the porch of the tre-
maine home conversing idly with dale
lars had disappeared probably having
discovered a crap game and tremaine
was inside the house it was a hot
stifling sunshiny day the air was heavy
with humiditv dale who was not
 

thoroughly acclimated had not gone up
to the dredger that afternoon as was
her wont it was too hot and unpleas-
ant on the river-at least that was
the reason she gave herself for staying
at home

  the talk naturally enough had
drifted to the work that was being dona
on the boat

  it takes a long time to get a dredger
assembled and in working order doesnt
it the girl remarked casually

  it is quite a job sadler glanced
at her saw that her eyes were not on
him and scrutinized her narrowly did
she suspect what he knew now to be
rogues of the jungle



almost a certainty-that maxwell was
deliberately delaying the work no
she hardly would be so friendly toward
the superintendent if she did

  i sometimes wish mr bettincourt
were here the girl went on he
bought the dredger you know and dis-
assembled it in the states before ship-
ping it down here he could probably
have put it together much faster than
ralph or any one else tts a shame
that he was drowned

  yes indeed its too bad

  sadler was on the point of telling her
that bettincourt was very much alive
but something restrained him a small
voice seemed to say paraphrasing lars
that this affair was none of his business
and that men who mix into the affairs
of others without invitation in the choco
are apt to find themselves in serious
trouble not that sadler was afraid of
trouble-he would meet it with as bold
a front as the next man-but he sensed
that the time had not yet arrived for
him to take a hand

  sadler became conscious that dales
eyes were on a figure which was just
disembarking from a canoe down the
river sadler followed the gaze and
saw an immaculate white-clad man
starting up the path toward the house
he frowned suddenly as he recognized
the arrival and glanced at dale she
was smiling apparently in pleasurable
anticipation sadlers eyes hardened
and he took a deep breath that was half
a sigh smiling-over seeing jose gon-
zales 

  the employee of the choco metals
corporation was a prepossessing figure
of a man he was well above average
height very straight and carried him-
self with admirable poise he wore a
small mustache which was always care-
fully waxed and curled his face while
just a bit gross was really handsome
he reminded sadler of a photograph he
had seen in a motion-picture magazine
which had come in from the states a

few days before the picture had been
captioned the screens perfect
lover and somehow sadlers men-
tal comment had not been favorable

  gonzales claimed to be a pure-blood
castilian however an old-timer had
once remarked to sadler there aint
no sich animal in colombia ive heard
tell that there was some pure spanish
families up round bogota but i aint
never seen em an i dont believe
theyre there and to sadler and to
every white man in the choco jose
gonzales for all his fine manners his
fine talk and fine clothes was just a
plain native he was a spaniard no
doubt but certainly not a pure-blooded
one

  gonzales bowed low as he reached
the porch and swept off his hat
buenas dias senorita he greeted
dale with his most engaging smile i
trust i find you well

  im very well thank you the
girl smiled and took his hand sadler
was writhing inwardly as she turned to
him mr sadler are you acquainted
with mr gonzales

  for the briefest moment the gazes
of the two men met and clashed there
was venom in the eyes of both venom
and distrust and uncompromising
hatred then gonzales smiled and held
out his hand in any other circum-
stances sadler would have knocked the
man down for his presumption now
he could only shake hands with him-r-
what a ripping up the back lars would
give him if he saw him clasping the
hand of this native i-and say

  yes i am well acquainted with mr
gonzales

  yes indeed the other said senor
sadler has worked for me several
times he apparently did not think
it necessary to add that on the occa-
sion of sadlers last resignation from
the employ of the choco metals the
young american had hit him a well-
timed blow on the jaw that had knocked


top-notch magazine

him into the river and sent him even-
tually to buena ventura for four new
teeth

  for an hour or more the three per-
sons sat on the porch and talked of
commonplaces gonzales making no
move to reveal the object of his visit
several times sadler caught the hand-
some spaniard glaring at him anger
smoldering in his black eyes despite
gonzales apparent calmness and poise
sadler knew that he boiled with sup-
pressed rage and that he would have
given much to have the opportunity of
slipping a knife into the back of this
interfering gringo but sadler made
no move to leave the two alone and
gonzales was at last forced to make
known the reason for his visit

  i atn taking our no  dredger up
the river lie told dale we have a
concession up there just above yours
and while the property is not particu-
larly rich we have decided to work it
for a time i wanted to ask if you
would be kind enough to drop your
lines and let our boat pass

  most assuredly the girl answered
readily of course i have no author-
ity to give you permission to pass but
i am certain it will be all right ill
speak to mr maxwell about it this
evening and tell him to be ready

  that is very kind of you gon-
zales said graciously we should be
up here some time to-morrow after-
noon

  gonzales departed shortly afterward
with much bowing and many thanks
dales blue eyes were warm as she
watched him stride down the path and
embark in his canoe once out in the
river he raised his hat to her in a
courtly gesture of farewell

  he is very nice isnt he the girl
remarked softly to sadler when gon-
zales had disappeared around a bend
in the river you know before i came
down here i had an idea that all
spaniards were desperados but senor

gonzales is certainly a perfect gentle-
man i like him immensely

  sadler nodded quietly not quite will-
ing to take it upon himself to disillusion
the girl a few minutes later he ex-
cused himself and went in search of
lars from the direction of the
jamaican camp he heard a bellowing
voice

  cum sax cum sax cum on you
liddle sax-spot ah sax ban right
shoot twenty reals

  sadler pulled him away from the
game with difficulty and hurried him
down toward the river he said noth-
ing until he had picked out a canoe
from several which were drawn up on
the bank tossed lars a palanca stepped
in and shoved off into the stream then
he remarked smiling at the puzzled
swede 

  miss tremaine just had a visitor in
the person of one jose gonzales who
asked permission to take his no 
dredger up the river past the tremaine
boat according to our friend the
choco metals has a concession on the
san miguel just above the tremaine
concession what do you think of it
lars scowled plainly put out over
the fact that sadler was forcing him
to mix into another mans business
that ground above tremaines conces-
sion wont run two cents a yard the
swede remarked at last

  of course it wont thats the
point when howard bettincourt took
up this section of the river he got every
foot that was worth while now why
is gonzales taking a dredger up the
river 

  lars shrugged disinterestedly meb-
be you better ask him

  and that is exactly what were go-
ing to do sadler smiled at lars ob-
vious discomfiture were going down
the river to have a talk with gon-
zales and if we dont come right out
and ask him why he is going up there
we can at least use our eyes and ears
rogues of the jungle



and pick up what wc can that fellow
has something crooked up his sleeve
lars i dont know what it is but
despite the fact that its none of our
business were going to try to find out
now bear down on that palanca 

chapter xii

aboard the dredger

qomething less than a half mile
below the tremaine camp sadler
and lars came upon the no  dredger
of the choco metals corporation a
large crew of men was warping the big
boat up the river and despite the fact
that the only motive power was the
dredgers own winches which worked
on cables anchored on the bank sadler
saw at once they were making unusually
good time

  you keep the dugout alongside and
wait for me sadler told his companion
ill go aboard and do the talking
skillfully maneuvering their craft to
the port side of the big dredger sadler
swung hastily aboard knowing that if
he tarried at all he would probably be
ordered to keep off crossing the deck
he came upon gonzales who was just
emerging from the winch room

  how goes it jose sadler asked
you seem to be making good progress
gonzales regarded his visitor with a
scowl the latins black eyes narrowing
as he scrutinized him in silence for a
moment i dont remember inviting
you aboard this boat sadler he said
pointedly

  oh dont worry about that the
american grinned im not the one
to wait on formality i just thought id
drop down and find out if you couldnt
use a couple of good dredger men

  i thought you were working for
tremaine gonzales told him coldly

  oh no weve just been staying
there a few days got a touch of fever
up the river and stopped off there to
recuperate were not tied up with them

at all they have all the men they can
use sadler saw the relief that came
over the spaniards face and smiled in-
wardly how about giving us a job
i have all the men i can use gon-
zales told him

  were experienced dredger men
sadler reminded

  experienced scoundrels i should
say the other snapped

  suit yourself sadler shrugged
smiling easily opinions differ on that
score however im not the man to
argue about it i guess lars and i will
have to drift down to san juan
apparently in no great hurry to leave
sadler glanced casually around the boat
nice little dredger you have here he
remarked that is it would be if you
had a bucket line and a stacker belt and
a few riffle boxes how do you expect
to do any dredging without a bucket
line

  i am afraid that is my business
sadler gonzales answered tersely

  of course it is came the easy an-
swer i was merely wondering

it might be well to do your wonder-
ing somewhere else than on this boat
the spaniard snapped ill give you
just about ten seconds to get off of it
and then

  ill throw you off

  you and how many more

  as many more as i need gonzales
answered

  you pay me a great compliment
senor the american said bowing but
i wont put you to the trouble of mak-
ing good your threat i am very in-
terested in how you are going to operate
a dredger without a bucket line if you
wont tell me though i guess my curi-
osity will have to go unsatisfied
the bucket line and the rest of the
equipment will be brought up later
gonzales exclaimed testily now get
off

  with the greatest of pleasure
senor


top-notch magazine

  calmly and with exasperating slow-
ness sadler walked across the deck to
the place were lars waited with their
canoe no luck sadler called down
smiling good-naturedly i guess well
have to drift to san juan as soon as
we feel able

  he dropped into the canoe grasped
his palanca and shoved off

  so long jose he called smilingly
to the angry white-clad figure on the
deck of the dredger i wish you luck
in bringing that bucket line over the
mud flats

chapter xiii

the ways of the choco

as he swung about and bent to the
task of poling the dugout up the
river sadlers smile faded lars this
is the most baffling problem i ever tried
to work out he began after a time i
just cant seem to get head nor tail to
it take that boat gonzales is warping
up the river for instance did you take
any notice of it 

  not much lars said with a shrug
im not much interested in gonzales
boat

  sadler regarded his companion keen-
ly the small blue eyes were on the
river but sadler could see that they
were sparkling and he sensed that lars
was far more interested in the affair
than he pretended

  well even if you wont admit it
sadler went on i know you noted the
absence of a bucket line on that boat
a lot of other equipment was conspicu-
ous by its absence too what is more
the hull is so rotten that its about ready
to fall to pieces now we know and
gonzales knows that the only way to
get a bucket line up the river is on a
dredger

  that boat was built for seven-foot
buckets ive forgotten just what a
seven-foot bucket weighs but it weighs
plenty gonzales wouldnt stand a
chance of getting a string of them up

the river in boats because the water is
too shallow for launches and the buckets
are too heavy to haul around by man
power

  remember sadler continued this
alleged concession that gonzales claims
his company owns begins about eight
miles above here the river is mighty
shallow up there and unless he puts on
the rest of his equipment before he
passes tremaines boat hell never get
it up he told miss tremaine that hed
be passing to-morrow afternoon that
means that he intends to run the boat
up without that equipment because he
hasnt time to put it aboard in the next
twenty-four hours

  all of which brings us back to the
original question-why in sam hill is
gonzales dragging a rotten worthless
dismantled hulk up the river

  lars grinned over his shoulder
thats some more of gonzales busi-
ness he answered calmly

  lars ive got a notion to hit you
over the head with this palanca sadler
threatened impatiently

  go ahead if you want to break the
palanca

  oh youre impossible sadler ex-
claimed havent you got a speck of
gratitude in your make-up dont you
realize that we are under obligation to
miss tremaine and her father they
took us into their camp without ques-
tion put doc pailthorpe to work on
us and no doubt saved our lives the
least that we can do is to try to pay
them back

  here they are sadler went on an
independent company with mighty little
experience and probably no financial
backing fighting the largest and the
most unscrupulous mining company in
south america their superintendent is
either a fool or a scoundrel bettincourt
has put up some kind of a job on them
that we cant figure out miss tremaine
is treating gonzales as if he was on the
level they are being hoodwinked on
rogues of the jungle



every side now the least we can do
is to step in here on the quiet of course
and try to get at the bottom of the thing
dont you think im right

  for a long time lars pondered the
question sadler watched him from the
stern watched the powerful muscles
rippling under his shirt as he plied his
palanca watched the great head with
its straw-colored hair move rhythmically
back and forth to the strokes of his pole

  good old lars there wasnt a
kinder bigger-hearted squarer man in
all colombia he needed him too
needed his level head and his powerful
physique and his knowledge of the ways
of the choco and lars would see the
light he would take the only view of
the situation possible-even if it were
in violation of his most sacred precept
lars would help him get at the bottom
of this mystery which grew deeper and
more complicated every day

  the huge swede nodded his head at
last very slowly and thoughtfully and
looked around at sadler youre right
jack i guess we owe them big debt
we try to square it

  that was all jbut sadler knew that
henceforth lars would be behind him
ready to back him up in anything he
might do toward unraveling this mys-
tery they poled along in silence for
a time

  thats funny thing-that dredger
lars remarked at length with a slow
shake of the head we got to find out
bout that

  i did all i could sadler said smil-
ing if i had stayed aboard another
minute we would have had a fight on
our hands well probably get our fill
of fighting before we see the end of
this thing and theres no use beginning
now it seems to me that it is up to
us to use our heads rather than our
fists

  yes thats right we got to do
plenty thinking

  and in the meantime sadler re-

marked it wouldnt do any harm to
drop down to san juan and look up
these concessions were strong enough
to stand the trip now and id like to find
out if tremaines title is all right also
it might be a good idea to find out if
the choco metals actually has a conces-
sion above tremaines if they havent
and we could convince the old man that
gonzales was up to mischief he could
refuse to drop his lines to let them
pass

  thats good idea lars nodded
but im fraid its too late to stop him
we cant find out bout those things till
to-morrow morning from san juan
back here is good eight hours poling
lak mad and by that time hes passed

  yes thats right sadler admitted
we havent got time enough to keep
him from passing tremaines boat even
if we could talk the old man into re-
fusing to drop his lines-which in itself
is mighty doubtful tremaine is so
blamed honest and unsophisticated that
he-thinks everybody else is on the level
that may be more or less true where
he came from but it is certainly not
true down here in the choco all of
which naturally makes it that much
harder for us

  were up against the proposition of
trying to help him without his coopera-
tion without even telling him what its
all about sadler continued he isnt
much of an executive lars and while
he may have a keen enough brain when
it comes to working out some things
he isnt much better than a second-class
moron when it comes to handling the
proposition lies up against here now
bis daughter-

  shes mighty purty liddle girl lars
interrupted smiling over his shoulder
at his companion

  sadler felt the color rising in ihis
cheeks under larsons scrutiny he
cursed himself silently he was as bad
as a high-school kid blushing at the
mere mention of a girl what in the


top-notch magazine

name of common sense was coming over
him lately must be losing his head

  i wasnt thinking of her looks he
made hasty response trying unsuccess-
fully to hide his confusion i was
thinking about her head she has
brains miss tremaine has more brains
than her father and maxwell and all
the rest of the crowd put together once
she begins to sabe how things are worked
down here shell start to use her
brains

  why not tell her lars suggested

  tell her what

  lars pondered this for a moment and
then shook his head bewilderedly

  after all sadler reminded him
there isnt much we could tell her a
lot of suspicions yes but not many
facts and she is the kind who would
demand facts of course we might
tell her that maxwell was stalling but
it would be our word against his and
naturally being in love with the man
-sadler choked a bit over the words-
she would believe him

  we might tell her too that bettin-
court is alive but that in itself proves
nothing and sounds rather fishy in the
bargain she would probably say that
we were mistaken that it was some other
man we saw in condoto or that there
were two bettincourts in colombia
and if we tried to tell her that gon-
zales was a crooked cutthroat she would
refuse to believe us not being ac-
quainted with these colombian natives

  no lars sadler continued our
cue right now is to keep our mouths
closed and use our eyes and ears and
brains sooner or later well stumble
onto something that will lead us to the
bottom of this mess and until we do
wed better keep our own counsel

  yes thats good advice lars
agreed he chuckled softly and his
voice was not without anticipation as he
added should somebody ask me im
thinkin theres goin be hot time in de
old choco purty soon now

chapter xiv

no men needed

at about four oclock that afternoon
ralph maxwell returned from the
dredger went at once to his cottage
changed his clothes and then strolled
down to the tremaine home he found
dale seated alone on the porch idly
turning the pages of a magazine his
rubber-soled shoes made no noise on the
path and the girl did not notice his ap-
proach he stood a moment and
watched her in silent admiration

  she wore a simple white dress of
some soft clinging material that became
her gloriously well her black hair
brushed straight back from her fore-
head was tinged with copper by the
rays of the low-slanting sun her deep-
blue eyes the silken texture of her skin
the grace and poise with which she held
her head combined to make a picture
that maxwell would never forget

  he advanced slowly hesitantly al-
most afraid to break the spell that her
charm had seemed to create then she
raised her head and saw him and smiled
-a smile that was so exquisite so filled
with radiant happiness that it left him
breathless with longing

  my dear he exclaimed reverently
youre the most beautiful thing i ever
saw in my life

  now now ralph she chided gent-
ly isnt it a little early in the evening
for compliments how did you get
along with the work to-day

  oh very well maxwell answered
obviously displeased at changing the
subject anything new here

  mr gonzales was down for a while
this afternoon he is bringing a boat
up the river to work a concession above
ours and he wanted to find out if we
would drop our lines and let him pass
i told him that it would be quite all
right

  yes of course we have to let him-
pass
rogues of the jungle



  thats what i thought i was sure
it would be all right with you it was
rather nice of him to come up and ask
permission though wasnt it

  maxwell smiled a bit wryly im
afraid thats not the only reason he
came he remarked oddly there was
more pride than resentment in his tones
as though he were very sure of his own
position gonzales would travel a
hundred miles to talk to a beautiful
woman by the way was sadler around
when gonzales came  the faint tight-
ening of the muscles about his mouth
passed unseen by the girl

  yes mr sadler was here all the
time it seems that they are old ac-
quaintances

  old possibly but not any too dear
maxwell commented laconically

  why what do you mean ralph
they certainly seemed friendly enough
theres quite a bit of hard feeling
between them or so gonzales gave me
to understand a couple of days ago when
i happened to mention sadler to him
i dont know much about it but they
had trouble i believe he caught sadler
robbing a sluice box had to fire the
man

  the color ebbed slowly from dales
cheeks she stared at maxwell for a
long time as though striving to read
his thoughts and then dropped her eyes
her slender hands clasped the arms of
her chair until the knuckles showed
blue i dont believe it she said very
calmly

  maxwell shrugged carelessly smiling
i tell you only what gonzales told
me and after all it isnt particularly
important i understand they plan to
leave in a day or two

  im sorry dale said slowly
theyre such good dredger men that i
wish we could keep them here chanc-
ing to glance down toward the river her
eyes brightened perceptibly here they
are now theyve been taking a little
run on the river

  hm funny maxwells counte-
nance was suddenly grave theyve
been down the river now i wonder
why

  probably to get a little exercise
dale answered readily quite uncon-
sciously a defensive note had crept into
her voice

  maxwell caught it and his eyes nar-
rowed but he made no comment

  ralph the girl began after a mo-
ment as sadler and lars started up the
path to the house why dont we offer
them positions with us

  we dont need any more men dale
until we start operating maxwell told
her and when were ready to go to
work i plan to go down to san juan
and hire my own crew

  but mr sadler and lars are such
good men that i should think youd try
to hire them before it is too late dale
pursued

  the two men under discussion were
so near that there was no time for fur-
ther argument

  no maxwell said sharply under
his breath

chapter xv

careful plans

hile lars went on up the path
sadler stopped a moment at the
porch the girl flushed almost imper-
ceptibly as sadler raised his hat to her
he sensed vaguely that he had been a
very recent subject of discussion

  were leaving in the morning miss
tremaine he said abruptly wondering
why it was that the words came so hard
i have some business to attend to in
san juan he added and i cant delay
any longer

  dales eyes dropped before his steady
gaze are you sure youre quite re-
covered she asked fumbling for the
words youre welcome to stay as
long as you wish you know


top-notch magazine

  thats very nice of you im sure
but were strong enough to make the
trip and i dont like to waste any more
time i want to thank you too for be-
ing so kind to lars and me we cer-
tainly appreciate it if there is any-
thing we can ever do for you dont fail
to call on us were pretty well known
through the choco and you shouldnt
have much trouble getting hold of us
if you need us

  thank you the girl said with a
smile she glanced quickly at max-
well saw that his lips were set in a thin
straight line and did not again refer
to the subject that was uppermost in
her mind

  there was a moments embarrassed
silence broken by the click of the latch
tremaine opened the door and walked
out onto the porch

  mr sadler and his friend are leav-
ing in the morning dad the girl told
him

  oh so soon im sorry to see you
go sir youre certain that you are
completely recovered 

  were as fit as two fiddles sadler
smiled he held out his hand to tre-
maine well be leaving early in the
morning so i probably wont see you
again

  he shook hands with tremaine
thanked him and apologized for lars
not dropping in to say good-by explain-
ing that the swede had gone over to the
jamaican camp to buy a canoe

  as sadler turned to dale he felt the
color mount suddenly to his cheeks
good-by miss tremaine i may see
you again before long

  her hand was in his pressing it with
a warm clasp for an instant his reso-
lution wilted he felt an impulse to tell
tremaine the whole situation to tell
him that he was not leaving for good
to ask him to take him on the joh but
sadler put down the impulf - utely
his plans were worked out he would
be a fool to deviate from them just be-

cause the friendly pressure of a girls
hand sent thrills coursing down his
spine and left him speechless for the
moment

  their gazes met and held the warm
brown eyes of the man looked into the
deep-blue eyes of the girl for a space
that might have been eternity the
world had sloughed away for the
brief moment of that handclasp they
were utterly alone united by a sense of
comradeship a sudden rush of emotion
that was stronger than any material
bond

  a sharp nervous cough from max-
well shattered the spell sadler released
the girls hand almost regretfully smil-
ing reassuringly into her eyes

  he swung around hurriedly to max-
well shook hands and said adios
old man see you again some time

  then lest they perceive that his whole
body was atremble he turned and has-
tened down the path toward the bodega
where he intended to make a few pur-
chases

chapter xvj

from ambush

cor a time the silence on the porch
was unbroken no one moved

  then dale striving to dispel the air
of constraint that had fallen over the
three remarked with an effort at casual-
ness  t hate to see them go

why maxwell asked promptly

  the girl smiled up at him quite cog-
nizant of and not wholly displeased with
the state of mind that prompted the
hasty question after all he must love
her a very great deal to be so jealous
of her

  mr sadler and lars are such good
hands dale answered i think wed
be very lucky if we coxikl add them to
our crew dont you dad

  tremaine nodded absently sadler
and lars seemed little better to him than
the next men-he had not been on the
rogues of the jungle



river that wild night when they had
saved his boat

  but even if we needed men right
now tremaine responded we dont
know that they are looking for work
they have ten thousand dollars in
platinum nuggets in the bodega safe
and it is quite likely that they want to
cash them in and have a good time in
town before they settle down to a job
again men of that type usually do
what type dad the girl asked in
level tones

  oh these rough adventurers whom
one finds kicking around this part of
the country

  the girl laughed softly not without
a certain vague disappointment one
could hardly expect two men who had
been months in the mountains out of
touch with civilization half dead with
fever to look as if they were on their
way to an afternoon tea party they
lost everything they had that night they
came here except their guns and their
platinum and they have had no oppor-
tunity to buy new clothes of course
they look rough but looks are often
only skin deep

  true enough maxwell smiled
thinly but just the same id like to
know where they got that platinum
they mined it up in the cordille-
ras dale told him steadily

  well more power to them if they

did maxwell said all the platinum
in these rivers came down out of the
mountains and if a man were game
enough and knew the country he might
do better up there at the source of sup-
ply than down here still- max-
well shrugged meaningly

  are you insinuating that they might
have stolen it dale asked

  no-not at all im just telling you
that id want to be mighty certain that
they were telling the truth about it be-
fore i hired them a platinum dredger
is no place for a man who is not entirely
trustworthy

  but i am positive that they are en-
tirely trustworthy the girl said
warmly

  maxwell was fast losing his temper
and i am equally positive that i will
not have them on the job he flared

  dale stared at him a little taken
aback surprised at the color which had
mounted to his cheeks for no other
reason than that you think they may
have stolen that platinum  she persisted
after a moment

  no i have a very excellent reason
for not wanting them here

  what is it

  id rather not tell you maxwell
evaded

  but id rather you would dale re-
turned emphatically

  for a moment the superintendent
stared straight into the girls blue eyes
he was thoroughly exasperated now
very well he said keeping his voice
steady with an effort as long as you
are so insistent ill tell you it is be-
cause i dont think they are fit for you
to associate with they have no stand-
ing with the right people in this part
of the country their morals are not of
the best and their reputations are very
questionable since they have been here
you have made no effort to keep them
in their place in fact you have gone
out of your way to be friendly with
sadler if he were a decent sort of a
fellow it would be different but i hap-
pen to know that he is not

  the color had ebbed from dales
cheeks until they were as white as chalk
maxwells insinuation had stunned her
left her bereft alike of words and of
the spirit to deny the charge it had
hurt too like the lash of a whip

  and maxwell who made the old old
mistake of thinking he knew women
could not forbear another and last touch
of the lash i am sorry to have to
make things so plain to you dale he
said in his gentlest tones but down
in this country decent people will have

nothing to do with a man whos such an
utter scoundrel as sadler is

  the girl leaped to her feet her eyes
flashing with humiliation and anger
oh you beast she cried pas-
sionately

  maxwell stepped back a pace thor-
oughly aghast dale swept him with
one contemptuous glance and then fled
into the house the superintendent
watched the door close sharply behind
her then he turned to tremaine with
a slow shake of his head

  great heavens he said in amaze-
ment one would think that it was i
who had done wrong instead of that
lowbred soldier of fortune

  the white head of the old man moved
slowly from side to side he too was
apparently quite bewildered by his
daughters sudden burst of temper

  women are hard to understand
maxwell frankly i think she liked
young sadler rather well i suppose it
was rather a blow to her to find out that
he was no good and she took it out
on the first man who was handy he
laughed quietly knowingly give her
a day or two maxwell and shell come
out of it all right they always do
yes i suppose she will maxwell
said still i dont see that i have com-
mitted any unpardonable sin he
shrugged wearily oh well ive got
to drop down the river and see gonzales
now have to make arrangements for
getting his boat past ours to-morrow
you neednt wait dinner for me good
evening sir

  the superintendent of the tremaine
dredger found gonzales eating his din-
ner in a tent pitched on the river bank
for various reasons the most important
of which was dale tremaine there was
little love lost between these two men
their conversation was brief and to the
point oddly enough it contained no
reference to the arrangements max-
well had mentioned to his employer
those two meddlers are leaving for

san juan in the morning maxwell said
abruptly

  well gonzales black eyes re-
garded him with a complacent ques-
tioning smile

  they were down here to-day werent
they

  yes

  and they used their eyes and very
likely their heads

  im afraid they did maxwell
well they will carry ten thousand
dollars in platinum with them when
they start down the river in the morn-
ing a word to your men-a little am-
bush-

  an excellent idea gonzales inter-
rupted him enthusiastically excellent
do you know what time they plan to
leave 

  probably some time after daylight
maxwell replied

  thank you for the information
gonzales bowed you can trust me
to make the most of it the spaniard
chuckled softly his piercing black eyes
on maxwell after all you and i can
work together on some things cant
we

  on some things yes the superin-
tendent returned coldly but there are
certain other things or persons that i

would advise you- maxwell broke

off shrugging

  yes go on gonzales said with a
cool smile im always ready to listen
to advice of course i dont always

heed it but-

  i think you understand me well
enough maxwell interrupted a sinis-
ter gleam in his cool blue eyes any-
way- oh well adios 

  maxwell strode out of the tent and
down to his canoe although not en-
tirely pleased with his visit his displeas-
ure was not occasioned by any pangs of
conscience for as he told himself
again and again during the trip up the
river all was fair in love and war-in

in a maze of intrigue

a s he made his way down the path
to the bodega the camp store jack
sadlers head was whirling dizzily
some vital change had come over him
during that brief moment when he had
held dale tremaines small hand in his
own or was it a change well hard-
ly  rather it was the conscious culmina-
tion of certain emotions which had been
growing stronger and stronger in his
heart ever since the day when he had
awakened from his delirium and gazed
up for the first time into dales clear
blue eyes

  there was not time to analyze these
emotions even had his head been clear
enough but he had a suspicion an awe-
some terrible suspicion that he had
fallen in love with dale tremaine and
he was afraid more thoroughly fright-
ened than he had ever been in his life
before he could face natives who
plotted to kill him he could stand the
fever unasked he could hurl himself
against the most powerful mining cor-
poration in south america but love
well it was a strange sensation and not
a pleasant one either

  he wished vaguely that the eddy in
the capistrano had not drifted their
canoe against the bank that night he
might have been able to fight off those
natives he might even have kept his
wits about him until their dugout drifted
down to san juan but love

  sadler found doc pailthorpe the
diminutive englishman in charge of
the bodega after making several pur-
chases in preparation for the trip on
the morrow sadler withdrew the buck-
skin bag of platinum nuggets from the
safe

  leaving old chap pailthorpe
asked gravely

  yes were pulling out in the morn-
ing were quite fit and we cant waste
any more time

  hm sorry to see you go the
englishmans pale eyes were vaguely
appealing as he gazed at sadler
sorry

  id hoped you and lars would stay
tremaine needs you miss dale needs
you

  i dont believe i understand pail-
thorpe just in what way do they need
us

  the englishman smiled and flashed
sadler a knowing look you arent
as badly dense as you try to make out
old chap youve been using your eyes
while youve been here and i guess
youve seen that certain things are go-
ing on around here eh what

  what things for instance sadler
pursued quietly

  well theyre rather hard to explain
if you havent seen them yourself but
it seems that theres dirty work at the
crossroads as your american play-
wrights would say however im only
the storekeeper here and what goes on
outside of the bodega is not my affair
only im bally well sorry to see you
two fellows pull out

  sadler realized without further con-
versation with the little englishman
that the man had either told him all he
knew or knowing more intended to
keep his own counsel it was useless
to try to draw him out further sadler
was gratified to know however that
pailthorpe was not on the inside of the
ring and that in the event of future
trouble he could doubtlessly be relied on
as an ally

  well were leaving in the morn-
ing sadler remarked walking toward
the door but i wouldnt be at all sur-
prised if youd see us back here before
long adios

  so long old chap

  it was after they had their dinner in
the mess hall and were packing up the
few belongings they had acquired at the
tremaine camp that sadler turned sud-
denly to the swede lars well leave


top-notch magazine

here about midnight to-night were
not going to take any chances by wait-
ing until morning

  you seen maxwell go downriver
too lars grinned

  he was just shoving off when i
came out of the bodega before dinner
youve got it figured about the same
as i have havent you

  lars nodded thoughtfully mebbe
its all right-mebbe not but i dont
think we better take any chances a
tip to gonzales and by yiminy thats
the end of us i dont trust that faller
maxwell

  you and i together lars ive got
a pretty strong hunch that he is working
hand and glove with the choco metals
crowd either that or hes all kinds
of a fool and i rather incline to the
former hypothesis dont you

  well i dont know much about them
hypo things lars said grinning but
i guess youre right by yiminy now
suppose we turn in and get liddle sleep
weve got hard trip in front of us
good idea lars but i dont believe
ill sleep much that dredger gonzales
is bringing up the river worries me a
lot cant seem to understand his game
if it were a real dredger that he could
work id say he was going to try to
steal some of tremainer ground but
he cant do any dredging with that boat
so why in the name of common sense
is he bringing it up the river

  mebbe we better sleep a while on it
ls said thats purty hard problem
vvell here goes the swede rolled
into bed and said no more

  sadler turned out the light and lay
clown knowing that he should get some
rest before the hard trip down the river
but realizing at the same time that his
mind was far too active for sleep the
problem of gonzales dredger alone was
enough to keep him awake to say noth-
ing of maxwells intentional delaying
of the work bettincourts framed-up
drowning the maze of intrigue into

which tremaine had been unwittingly
hurled

chapter xviii

ten to one

xhen his watch told him that it was
midnight sadler was still wide
awake however as he slipped out of
his bed and crossed the room to awaken
lars there was a certain confidence
about his movements and his bearing
that showed that his long hours of
thought had not been fruitless he
shook the great form of the swede

  lars lars he whispered wake
up old man ive got it

  lars rolled over wide awake in an
instant glad to hear it he answered
what you got

  oh you old ruffian sadler ex-
claimed in an impatient whisper what
do you think ive got ive solved that
riddle of course

  the dredger

  yes but come on and get into
your clothes id rather not talk too
much around here one never can tell
you know and dont try to turn on
the light were leaving in the dark
and as quietly as possible

  ten minutes later they were on the
river had found the canoe lars had
purchased and were embarked their
palancas moved rhythmically cutting
the oily black water in silence driving
the light dugout down the river some
distance below the tremaine camp they
swung around a bend and came sud-
denly upon gonzales dredger not more
than two hundred yards away

  lars cursed sharply the dredger
was under way the grinding of its
winches clearly audible it was lighted
too with more than the ordinary num-
ber of lights there were so many that
the river was illumined faintly from
bank to bank

  he has more brains than i gave him
credit for sadler exclaimed he
must have figured that we were suspi-
rogues of the jungle



cions and would try to pull out during
the night those extra lights have been
rigged since we were down here yester-
day well i guess its a case of run
for it and take our chances its ten
to one that theyll open fire on us but
its also ten to one that they wont hit
us the boat is on the west side of the
river in the channel well drop down
along the east side close to shore and
as soon as we get in the light well make
a quick dash are you game lars
lars laid down his palanca very de-
liberately no ay ant ban game
he growled tersely ay ant ban goin
mak no quick dash

  sadler started hardly crediting his
ears in all the years that he had
known lars lie had never seen him
show the white feather before lars
afraid to face the guns of a few natives
in practical darkness if it had been
daytime he would hardly have blamed
him but in that faint light-well it was
incredible

  shall we go back sadler asked
sharply

  no ve skol not go back lars
answered

  then what shall we do

  lars cursed softly in swedish when
his feelings had been thus relieved he
pointed ahead toward the dredger
you ban seeing dem lines lie
queried

  sadler peered ahead through the dark-
ness and suddenly caught his breath
the steel cables by which the boat was
being warped up the river ordinarily
ran from the deadmen on the bank to
heavy sheaves ten feet or more above
the deck and thence to the winches in
the winch room

  usually the cablcs which ran to either
bank were high enough above the river
to permit a small boat to pass under
them now however sadler saw that
additional sheaves had been fitted close
to the water- line of the dredger the
lines instead of being well above the

water were so close to it as to make
the passage of a boat impossible

  sadler drove his palanca into the bot-
tom and brought the canoe to a stop

  i understand a little better now
lars he said apologetically at first
i thought you were afraid

  you tank ay ben fraid of dem na-
tive faller huh in bout five minoot
ay ban goin pull few of dem faller to
pieces to see what mak dem run by
viminy

  theres no use picking a fight with
them lars sadler cautioned hastily
were outnumbered ten to one and it
would just give gonzales an excuse to
kill us

  but they ban goin drop tose -lines
an let us trough or im goin raise
plenty hal lars declared steadfastly

  now just a minute lars sadler
said lets think this thing out there
must be some way wait ive got it
suppose wc creep along the east bank
as far as we can and then land well
find three or four bank men in charge
of that port headline well pull our
guns on them and force them to drop
the line then well march them up the
river make them get in our canoe and
pole us down past the dredger if we
work it right well be past the boat and
have the natives chucked into the river
before gonzales knows what has hap-
pened and even if it does dawn on
him he wont dare to shoot for fear of
hitting his own men

  by yiminy yack you ban bright
faller lars exclaimed with enthusi-
asm come on

  swinging their dugout into the east
bank where it was invisible in the shad-
ows of the heavy foliage which over-
hung the stream they poled a short dis-
tance farther down and then landed
fortunately the undergrowth had been
cleared to some extent here to make
way for the bank men who handled the
dredgers lines and the two men could
make their way in comparative silence

they had just stepped out on the bank
when sadler grasped the swedes arm

  it may be lucky for us that we
couldnt make a dash for it he whis-
pered see those men on the boat

  lars stared down the river he made
no sound but his great body began sud-
denly to tremble with anger as he per-
ceived three natives seated in the shad-
ows of the superstructure of the
dredger rifles resting across their knees

  lars and sadler moved slowly now
creeping forward through the high
grass occasionally they heard the
sound of voices below them and
at last they made out four natives
lazily engaged in the task of burying a
deadman on which the boats lines
would be fastened for its next step
ahead they crept as close as they
dared

  now sadler whispered

  as one man he and lars leaped for-
ward with drawn revolvers they were
 the natives before the men realized
what had happened

  get your hands up sadler ordered
tersely in spanish

  the natives complied with alacrity
thoroughly surprised

  see if they have any guns on them
lars if they have throw the guns into
the river

  larson ran a rough hand over each
of the half-clothed barefooted work-
men  the swede growled vague threats
that would have struck fear into the
hearts of most any men he found no
weapons save a machete which he calm-
ly tossed into the river

  now you men get down there and
cast off that headline sadler ordered
quick now unless you want to feel
some hot lead between your ribs

  the natives needed  urging they
scurried down the river to the deadman
on which the dredge was moored and

fell to work a moment later the heavy
cable slid off into the water

 this way now quick sadler
commanded and herded the men back
up the river to the canoe

  they embarked swiftly thrusting
palancas into the hands of the natives
sadler bade them pole downstream as
though a thousand devils were after
them they had just got under way
when they heard a lusty hail from the
dredger

  sadler thrust his gun against the ribs
of one of the natives call back to
them and tell them the line carried
away he ordered and then as the
man hesitated he added hurry
or ill have to kill you where you stand

  the native obeyed bellowing the mes-
sage to the dredger in a great voice
the canoe gathered headway swept
swifdy into the circle of light about the
dredger for a brief while they moved
unchallenged then the men on the
boat awoke suddenly to life there was
a scurrying about the deck excited
shouting men appeared as if by magic
-and then the white-clad form of gon-
zales emerged from the winch room

  took em by surprise didnt we
sadler grinned at lars by the time
they wake up and start after us well
be half a mile down the river

  unfortunately however sadler had
underestimated the ruthless nature of
jose gonzales the canoe was directly
opposite the dredger and distant less
than a hundred feet when they heard
the spaniard shout an order a half
dozen rifles in the hands of as many
men leaped up

  hes going to risk the lives of his
own men by shooting at us sadler
cried

you need no protection you-

 shrilly i need no protection you
 care not what happens to me

 but i would care i would weep on
 your grave

 say no more roared antonio if
 you think i enjoy your talk of weeping
 on my grave you have as little sense as
 your actions indicate

 but you do not understand the whole

of this and-

 i have no desire to understand even
 part

 but listen now you are only a

 private in the army of yorando so-

 and if i listen to you i will be a
 fool who has ceased to live woman-

the mighty warrior

was true that soldado an-

whelming desire to wring the
jjopipm neck of the woman he loved

had she been his wife instead
of fiancee the desire might have won
she was however only the girl who
had promised to marry him some day
and antonio felt a certain hesitancy in
engaging in such a delightful pastime
as marriage so long as there might be
a question as to his legal rights in the
matter

  you should not interfere with my
affairs he howled we are not yet

married and-

  we may not be married at all do-

have not the sense to see that i my

you i-

honor

  you will not be shot dolores said

up the theme and ill look out for my-
self

  you will not you will kill or cap-
ture santiago and be made sergeant
then we will marry you know what
it would mean antonio for you to be a
sergeant it is fortunate that once my
father did the noble commandante a
favor and also fortunate that my
father learned santiago was coming
here he immediately told the com-
mandante and suggested that you guard
him never have your people or mine
been of importance with us to be a
sergeant is as great as being a general
would be with others and perhaps that
would be only the beginning

  it is the beginning of the end for
me santiago is a killer

  and so can you be then will come
honor and i will be the wife of an
officer-not the wife of a barefooted
laborer or private soldier always has
my father been nothing more than a
fruit cutter on the plantations never
have you been more than one who helps
load the fruit steamers of the gringo
company or just a soldier in the ranks
of the army always have i seen for
you possibilities in the army and when
you enlisted as a regular i was happy
knowing that your opportunity would
come being a regular is much better
than just being a soldier ninety days
each year because of the law when one

has sense he-

  if i had sense muttered antonio
i would have left here before this fool
idea was born in your head

  she stiffened if it is that you do

not love me i-

  but i do i was only excited

  she read the truth in his face knew
that he did care a great deal and because
she cared he could forgive much then
you will do as i say and it is not for
myself alone that i want to see you a
sergeant it is for you it will give

shoes all the time and so will i and

people who do not notice you now will
be glad then to claim you as a friend
antonio knew that dolores was speak-
ing truth he knew that in the army
of this little central american republic
a sergeant was of much more importance
than in many other countries and he
was as anxious for the honor as the
girl but being the one called on to face
the danger he realized the difficulties in
his path santiago velasco was no gen-
tle creature he was fully as bad as his
brother bandit and revolutionist who
had only a short time before been cap-
tured by the commandantes men

  and now santiago had sworn venge-
ance was coming to puerto arturo to
slay the commandante this much an-
tonio knew he felt that further in-
formation would be his before the affair
ended

  it has to be handled quietly the girl
told him the secret service informs
the commandante that there is danger of
a revolution santiago velasco is very
popular with some people many liked
his brother should these people know
that he is likely to get in trouble when
he comes they might do many things
so the commandante cannot send forth
the men at the barracks to capture him
nor can he place a number of guards
that would give the whole thing away

  always though dolores went on
he has a special guard of honor at his
home at night you are now to be that
guard you will be released from fur-
ther duties all you will do is report at
his office each afternoon at four oclock
and escort him home and remain out-
side until eight oclock the following
morning

  while he remains inside-safe
yes and santiago will come
your rifle will fire

  and miss him commented antonio
bitterly and he will be upon me with
knife and gun

  for several seconds they gazed out
across the coconut-dotted plaza at the
too much honor



beach where the restless waves lapped
hungrily at the sands antonio wished
that he might be on one of the sailboats
anchored a short distance from shore
with the command already given to
up anchor and away he envied
every one and everything he saw
even to the homeless dogs fighting over
a bone alongside the hotel international
the shrieking of a locomotive whistle
as it carried a well-filled train of bananas
out onto the dock for loading on a new
orleans steamer caused him to jump

  dolores broke the silence i go now
i see the sergeant approaching to assign
you to your new duties he knows
nothing of this the commandante told
my father when he realized the danger
and they decided what was to be done
and i think no less of you antonio
for disliking this task i realize that
you do not understand all it means you
will be covered with glory

   i will be covered with dirt

  but no you are a brave man an-
tonio it is only that you have not been
tried that you hesitate i know you are
brave because i could love only such a
man-and i love you some day you
will thank my father and me for what
we have done

chapter ii

no less than sergeant

coon after dolores had left antonio
the sergeant came and officially as-
signed him his new duties

  i envy you the sergeant in his
great ignorance told antonio it is
a great honor this which is being shown
you you should be thankful that our
noble colonel mateo cabrera is indeed
a soldado who believes in having a
guard of honor at his house and that
you are to be that guard

   it was shortly after eight oclock that
evening that the colonel called antonio
to him you understand why you are
here the sergeant does not so i will

show you the manner in which you are
to guard

  he took antonio to the rear of the
house and pointed into the darkness
there is a high wall there and two
very fierce dogs santiago velasco will
not come that way it is the front you
are to guard

  colonel cabrera mopped a moist brow
it is very warm these night so i leave
the front door open you will remain
in front of that and see that he does
not enter

  you sleep on the first floor

  the colonel shook his head no-
on the second there will be no one
except you down here and be careful
some time soon he will come of that
i am sure and he will come at night
it is only because you have been so
highly recommended that the honor of
meeting him is to be yours and i shall
reward i have so promised the man
who is to be your father-in-law and i
always keep my word once you have
settled santiago velasco no less than
a sergeant shall you be 

  antonio took his post much disturbed
in mind at last the sounds within the
house told him that the commandante
and his family had retired this was
what antonio had been waiting for he
felt that he could remain still no longer
he must walk he would pace the
veranda and then came the thought
that the colonel would hear he must
wait

  midnight came and antonio felt it
safe to pace he paced the wind
rustling through the coconut trees sur-
rounding the house made him jerky
the booming of the waves on the beach
away across town eased his nerves not
one bit from down the street came the
screechy song of a cheap phonograph
somewhere a woman laughed antonio
swore he could not understand any
ones laughing at such a time

  once his heart came near ceasing to
beat a man stopped midway in the

block eyed the house intently for a
moment and then turned and walked
rapidly away antonio eased to the
door and peered down a long wide hall
he remembered having noticed a large
closet on one side of this hall the
closet struck him as being a good place
for a frightened guard should trouble
arise

chapter iii

from a window

the night was a terrible one and
antonio was truly thankful when
it came to an end the commandante
eyed him sharply when he came down
did i not hear you walking

  antonio went weak all over si
senor colonel i thought i saw some
one and thought best to walk back and
forth a bit

  colonel cabrera stroked his black
mustache perhaps that is better you
will be near the door all the time and
can see in all directions

  antonio was nervous during the walk
from the commandantes house to the
barracks he started as he saw a man
peering from a cantina window it
helped not one bit when another man
stopped on a corner and watched them
pass

  these men antonio believed were
friends of santiago spying out the lay
of the land and about the first thing
they would do once their plans were
made would be to shoot him antonio
right then the commandante came near
being deserted

  he was glad when the commandante
was in his office and he was free to go
guarding the colonel now would be the
duty of the soldiers at the barracks none
of whom had heard of santiagos threat
and whose watchful care would be in
the general line of duty

  antonio slept little that day and at
last left his house with a bright idea
he would find a friend he knew he
could trust-to a certain extent-and



persuade this friend to go to the com-
mandante with bad reports concerning
antonio once the commandante
should get this information he would
most certainly ask for another and dif-
ferent guard

  antonio found the friend secured the
promise of his help and breathed easier
the gallant lover of dolores showed up
at the barracks at the appointed time
fully expecting to be cursed out and sent
to loaf with the other soldiers but not
so the commandante was smiling
when they started home and once there
he broke the news to antonio

  there came to me to-day a terrible
liar the commandante said he told
some queer things about you

   si colonel 

  colonel cabrera laughed he is now
in prison where he will remain for a
week to think the matter over i cannot
allow a man who would slander my
guard to remain unpunished i have
heard so much good about you that i
cannot believe such lies

  antonios brown skin became ashen
he could not escape from this danger
and in attempting to do so he had got
a friend into trouble of course the
friend would be liberated soon but
antonio really regretted that he should
suffer even temporary discomfort
however he would manage in some way
to make amends

  it was near midnight when his first
big fright came something moved un-
der the house one of the dogs at the
rear barked antonios eyes came near
popping from trembling sockets he
tried to raise his gun and found this
well-nigh impossible

  then there came another noise an-
tonio started to run-and could not
the moving thing was under the ve-
randa now suddenly the shuddering
soldier was conscious of the most ter-
rifying racket he had ever heard it
was fully half a minute before antonio
realized that the terrific yowling and
too much honor



spitting was nothing more nor less than
a cat fight

  at last the fight was over and an-
tonios nerves became somewhat quieted
he paced back and forth

  toward morning the moon rose for
which he was thankful-until he saw
a man skulking under the trees an-
tonio drew as near the wall as possible
and prayed for the best feeling sure
that the worst had arrived

  eventually however the skulker dis-
appeared and soon daylight came
after another walk to the office with
the precious commandante again an-
tonio was free but that morning he saw
three men watching instead of two as
on the previous day he hurried to the
home of dolores

  i hear good news of you she told
him the people say you look fine as
guard of honor to the commandante
of course they do not realize how
brave you really are

  that is enough antonio told her
sternly

  but there is more my father says
it is almost certain that santiago velasco
will come soon

 soon why- the words died

in antonios throat

  yes and you will get him then
youll be a sergeant and we will be
married

  antonio lingered not long after that

chapter iv

with a crash

the third night of antonios torture
came at last never before it
seemed to him had there been so many
and such terrifying night noises once
he came near leaving the earth when a
prowling dog leaped a fence across the
street he choked when the dogs be-
hind the commandantes house hearing
this one let up a roar and tried to get
to him a night bird flew along over-
head crying shrilly and caused an-

tonios hair to stand on end twice some
one walked past

  all things however must come to an
end darkness gave way to light and
again it was day

  toward noon the father of dolores
came to antonio soon the old man
said exultantly you will have your
chance

  what 

  si i have heard that santiago
velasco was seen in a village near here
only yesterday and i heard that he
swears he will kill the commandante as

he sleeps

 i-ah-

  and you will be a hero

  i will be dead

  nonsense i am going to be very
proud of my son-in-law

  a sudden suspicion entered antonios
brain is it that you would have your
daughter wed another and desire to
have me killed

  you talk-there was pain in the old
mans tone-foolishly my son it is
only that i love you

  you have a poor way of showing
your love cried antonio if i loved
one i would not place him where he is
to be shot and then have his throat cut
you are excited you will get over
that the old man turned and walked
away

  he left antonio thinking antonio
was not going to remain there to be
killed he would desert that was
what he would do he could be well
on the way before he was missed and
then he knew that he did not dare desert
he had witnessed the punishment of
recaptured deserters it was no pleas-
ant thing no he would remain-and

die	perhaps when he was no more
dolores would regret her cruelly to
him

  however that night as he paced the
veranda he felt strangely alone and
afraid in every shadow there was an
enemy he thought more of deserting


top-notch magazine

once he thought he heard something
move behind the house and wondered
why the dogs made no noise a little
later he could have sworn that he heard
a window raised gently

  he eased to the edge of the veranda
and again he saw a man moving along
under the trees he whirled and there
was another crawling on hands and
knees-toward the house

  that settled it antonio forgot do-
lores he forgot what it meant to
desert he forgot everything except
that danger was near and he was going
from the place

  he dropped his gun with a crash and
hit the street running at the corner he
came to a sudden stop a man stepped
from behind a little house and spoke to
him antonio thought dazedly that he
had seen him running and had hurried
to head him off hardly knowing which
way he was headed antonio wheeled
and was again running toward the com-
mandantes house and there in front
he stopped again but only for an instant
a man was running swiftly toward
him he glanced behind the other was
near

  a wild squawk escaped antonios
lips he darted onto the veranda and
then into the wide hallway-and re-
membered the closet a second later
he was inside

  then there arose a noise that made
the cat fight of the night before sound
as nothing antonio had jumped on
something in that closet and that some-
thing was alive more it was fighting
antonio fought back they bit they
swore they hammered with fists they
kicked they butted with heads-and at
last rolled out of the closet into the hall
and continued to fight

  in a few seconds they were on their
feet antonio jerked loose and struck
the enemy went down

  the soldier felt a touch on his shoul-
der and he turned fighting there burst
from the lips of the second man before

him an oath as antonios fist caught him
in the chest this man like the one in
the closet was willing to strike

  fight number two was under way
they locked in tight embrace paraded
the hall and crashed to the floor

  from upstairs came the shrieks of a
woman and the wild yells of the com-
mandante away off somewhere police-
men hearing the noise blew shrilly on
their whistles arid waited patiently for
some one else to go to the scene of the
trouble

  there came a roar as antonios teeth
closed on the thumb of his second an-
tagonist the roar was followed by a
wild yell for mercy

  then antonio felt other arms about
him a fist caught him on the side of
the jaw and he tumbled over uncon-
scious

chapter v

ah brave man 

it was perhaps five minutes before an-
tonio opened his eyes a flash light
was glaring in his face and over him
stood the commandante and four other
men

  the commandante was smiling
these-the commandante indicated
the men beside him-are secret-service
men the one whose thumb you chewed
is also a secret-service man it was
dark and you jumped on him through
mistake i did not tell you that while
you guarded me in order to get san-
tiago velasco in the event he gained the
house that these men were watching to
see that he did not get here but he
slipped past them and poisoned my
dogs raised a rear window-and was
hiding in the closet soon he would
have stolen upstairs to slay me you
brave man that you are prevented this
tragedy

  slowly very slowly antonio com-
prehended these were the men he had
seen slipping about the house watching
on the street the men that had fright-
too much honor



ened him he hoped they would not
inquire into his reasons for running

  his fears as to this were soon quieted
evidently in the excitement his strange
behavior had been forgotten or it may
have been attributed to the eccentricities
of a brave man

 the commandante was speaking
again santiago velasco is securely
tied and ready to go to prison there
will be no further trouble from him
and you shall have your reward you
will be a sergeant i am sure you will
understand why i did not tell you about

the secret-service men you see it is
not always well to tell too much
antonio in that instant became the
man dolores wanted him to be no
longer was he timid and afraid he was
an officer-a man of importance he
now had almost too much honor he
puffed out his chest no senor com-
mandante i antonio cordoba undoer
of the wicked do not have to be told
anything

  antonio smiled benevolently as he
added i know for myself all that is
necessary

was in plenty and timber grew all
around them as they had arrived
when the sun was setting they named
the place setting sun

  the years that passed had been no
kinder no more unkind than the same
years had been to many another com-
munity founded in much the same way
when the state came in and was or-
ganized setting sun became a county
seat and a rude courthouse was con-
structed dave barbour went the way
of all flesh but there was a son who
bore his name

  generation followed generation vari-
ous industries came some to flourish
and grow too big for the community that
had nourished them others to wither
and become memories

  setting sun became a city accord-
ing to the law whereby cities were clas-
sified and told the form of government
they must adopt setting sun was in-
cluded as a city of the fifth class some-
thing of the feeling of the citizens may
be sensed when it is realized that they
did not protest-did not demand a
step up

chapter i

a modern pioneer

their infinite wisdom some
historians have woven about
the middle-western pioneers
the glamour of romance per-
haps the history of most early
settlements has justified this attitude
but in die case of setting sun it was
stern reality rather than romance that
brought the settlement into existence

  dave barbour had led a little band
from north carolina across kentucky
and somehow the ohio river had been
negotiated they had pushed on to the
north complaints increasing from the
footsore and weary on that october
evening in  when the maples oaks
and hickories were flaming in their
autumn glory dave piloted the party to
the bank of a stream

  th suns a-settin dave an-
nounced lets light an eat

  they alighted and ate around a
camp fire that night a vote was taken
and the majority favored remaining
right where they were water there
the rise of setting sun



  again when the federal census
counted five thousand three hundred
and forty-six heads in setting sun
there was no movement for a recount
no clamor that the city had a population
of at least ten thousand

  down the line somewhere there had
been another dave barbour he was
eligible to join the society of pioneers
but the wanderlust that drove the orig-
inal dave through the wilderness to the
north reached down and touched him
as he had played with the little boys
of his own age and sometimes with the
little girls he had been a cowboy rid-
ing over the great prairies one day
he and ruth derby had taken some
cookies and started for parts unknown
but she was afraid of the dark and he
had to bring her back

  dave and ruth wrote notes to each
other in the eighth grade they became
conscious that they were members of
the great families of boyhood and girl-
hood when they went through high
school together this knowledge both
drove them apart and drew them to-
gether there was a certain -shyness
between them also a great and name-
less longing

  at the senior picnic in howlands
woods the day after commencement
dave and ruth trailed off together and
sat on a fallen monarch commonly
called a log

  what are you going to do dave
now that youve graduated ruth
asked as she chewed a stem of grass

  i dont know dave replied some-
thing vague and uneasy in his answer
i can get a job clerkin in the drug
store and theres a chance to work in
the sawmill but shucks im getting
tired of this old place what are you
goin to do

  oh i dont know either ruth
pulled more grass and bit off the tender
stemj maybe ill go to college next
fall

  yes and get stuck on some college

  fellow just because he has good clothes
to wear

  do you think id forget you dave

  i aint so sure about that dave
replied

  they heard voices coming in their
direction dave reached over and took
ruths hand he was sixteen and she
was a year younger

  heres something you neednt for-
get said dave as he suddenly drew
her to him and kissed her

  ruth jumped to her feet her face
flaming the voices were closer now
their classmates would find them in a
moment then she leaned toward dave
who still occupied the log a little doubt-
ful now about the propriety of his re-
cent salute

  if you dont want me to she whis-
pered ill-ill never forget it

  next week dave hopped a freight
train and left for parts unknown he
was unconscious of the fact that he too
was pioneering joe temple who saw
him leave predicted that he would turn
out to be a tramp the spirit of ad-
venture did not burn in joes breast
the greatest excitement in his life had
been a journey to benton harbor on a
dollar excursion and sleeping on a
strangers shoulder most of the way
home

  chicago did not send out a reception
committee to meet dave barbour and
present him with a key to the city
however dave did not need a key
the door evidently had been left un-
locked the city awed him with its
speed bulk and magnificence but he
fought back with the valor of a country
boy who deals his hardest blows to save
his pride

as the original dave had looked upon
the- tallest tree as something to bring
crashing down so the modern dave
sized up the tallest building within sight
and bore down upon it determined to
prove the truth of the assertion that
the bigger they are the harder they

fall he decided to begin at the top
and work down

  an express elevator whirled him to
the eighteenth floor and there before
his somewhat startled gaze he saw a
door upon which was lettered the an-
nouncement that the eclipse advertis-
ing agency inc was to be found
within

  dave knew about advertisements he
had read them in the setting sun en-
terprise they told that john mat-
thews was a dealer in staple and fancy
groceries canned goods a specialty or
that gus pugh had the largest assort-
ment of patent medicines in town or
that henry porters mammoth bee
hive was the place for bargains-if
we please you tell others if we dont
please you tell us

  therefore dave opened the eclipse
agencys door and encountered nathan
kirchman who was preparing to enter-
tain a stroke of apoplexy for the reason
that the office boys grandmother had
died that afternoon for the sixth time
and the boy had gone to attend the
funeral which apparently was being
held at the white sox park kirchman
was president of the eclipse agency and
when no office boy had answered al-
though he had flattened his thumb
against the buzzer button repeatedly he
had come oharging through the office
and run into dave opportunity had
not knocked at daves door rather had
opportunity opened the door and in-
vited dave to step in

  all that the boy knew about the art
of obtaining employment was to ask for
it that was the way they did in set-
ting sun so he demanded a job at
once and as the regular office boy was
absent without leave dave barbour got
his place

  take this proof to johnson brothers
as soon as you can get it there and wait
for corrections kirchman instructed
him then hurry back here and ill
have something else for you to do

  thus dave barbour became an ad-
vertising man

chapter ii

taking a chance

eventually dave barbour
reached the place where his copy
forced millions of people to brush their
teeth with a certain kind of brush
where jaded appetites were tempted
solely because of the alluring things he
wrote about baking powder he toyed
with qualifying words as if they had
been taught to obey him from infancy
advertising experts spoke of him in
awe as one of the hignest-paid copy
writers in the country

meanwhile what of setting sun

  dave had not gone back his father
and mother had died when he was little
and the aunt with whom he lived as a
high-school student had followed them
to garland brook cemetery a year after
he ran away of course he had sent
a picture postal to ruth and occasional-
ly he wrote her a note pete fleming
came up to see him one day after visit-
ing the stockyards and lincoln park

  how is the old town dave wanted
to know

  well she aint the burg she used to
be and she never was  pete exclaimed
seems like she aint got no pep some
of them towns down around there have
been lookin up a right smart theyve
been gettin factories an organizin an
doin things like that but you know how
settin sun always was theres a lot
o old mossbacks down there that dont
know what progress means start out
t raise money for a band concert an
they wont give a dime unless you prom-
ise to have the band play in front o
their stores we tried t put on a
chautauqua an couldnt sell enough
tickets t meet the guarantee durned
if i dont believe settin suns dead
and dont know it

  after pete left dave fell to thinking
of the old days the chap who said
the rise of setting sun



distance lends enchantment knew some-
thing after all memory knocked off
the rough spots of setting sun for dave
barbour and left a sparkling little gem
over which he pondered he sighed and
relaxed realizing for perhaps the first
time the strain under which he had been
living

   after all it wasnt good to pull up
all the roots of youth there should be
some sort of bond between him and the
place where he had spent his boyhood
he called a stenographer and wrote a
note subscribing for the setting sun
enterprise

   events of the next few months inter-
ested dave more than he realized from
day to day as he read the enterprise in
a search for names that were familiar
he realized a change in the spirit of the
place they were trying to do some-
thing after all

  a paid organizer of the civic-
evangelist type was announced for a
series of get-together meetings he
came and told the community that what
it needed most was a chamber of com-
merce steps were taken to provide
cluster lights around the public square

  on another day dave read about a
booster sale to which the entire county-
side had been invited the inducement
was a five-per-cent reduction from list
prices on the part of all setting sun
merchants moreover there would be
handsome prizes for all who held lucky
numbers

  a city-improvement club was formed
and prizes offered for the best-kept
lawns a bandstand was advocated for
the public square and a petition was
being circulated asking the city council
to appropriate money to pay for con-
certs

  gosh dave exclaimed after read-
ing a late copy of the enterprise
theyve gone in for sloganeering

  the chamber of commerce was offer-
ing ten dollars in gold for the best
slogan that could be used to advertise

setting sun so far there had been
many suggestions such as we lead
others follow excuse our dust
the sun never sets on setting sun
setting sun shines for all weve
got the rep for plenty of pep and
so on

  pete fleming sent dave a letter and
inclosed a booklet giving to all the
world certain salient facts about setting
sun

  after all its no laughing matter
dave told himself after he had chuckled
over some of the assertions in the book-
let its more or less pitiful to hear
them shouting about four miles of paved
streets when they probably wouldnt
have had any if one of the state high-
ways hadnt gone through all that
talk about how many miles of cement
sidewalks they have and not a word
about the old flagstone pavements in
other parts of town

  suddenly dave realized he was re-
senting the laughs that other and more
thriving cities would give setting sun
on its effort to get somewhere and be
somebody he had the feeling that the
campaign would fail the town evan-
gelist had planted some seed but the
chief thing he had done was to take
away a percentage on every member who
joined the chamber of commerce during
his campaign

   two or three letters to the editor of
the enterprise printed in the voice
of the people department gave a clew
these letters protested that setting sun
should be left alone that there was no
call for all this effort toward putting on
new airs and graces and that if the
town was not good enough for some
folks they might as well move away
so said constant reader citizen and
taxpayer and interested subscriber

  dave knew that any factory fund set-
ting sun might raise would not be
enough to attract more than one modern
pop-corn stand he appreciated the
spirit that some of the newer citizens


top-notch magazine

were showing but he concluded that
the spasm of civic spirit and community
consciousness would be followed by a
relapse of serious consequences

  suddenly dave admitted that he was
tired he was tired of telling the public
what it should eat what brand of collars
it should wear what make of tires to
buy and the kind of springs on which
it might seek repose at night

  its been ten years since i was back
there he said running his fingers
through his hair ive been too busy
making good as they say coining money
and all that sort of thing to give the
old town the once-over i know they
expected me to fail when i ran away
and here ive been wanting just a little
higher stack of dollars before i went
back to shake hands with every one of
them and do whatever i could to show
them that success had not made me
stuck up

  he gazed through a big window that
gave him an unobstructed view of the
lake but it was not the lake he saw
before him as if it had been yesterday
stretched away the meadow behind the
house where he used to play with the
harrison boys he could hear the musi-
cal murmur of driftwood creek as the
water ran over the ripple and on to the
deeper reaches of the old swimming
hole he glimpsed the wonders of
spring as it came to setting sun stud-
ding all the fields and woods with
flowers there was a flash-back to
autumn and the witchery of color as
nature came to lavish that mysterious
all-golden blend with which the foliage
flamed for a time as if to say we
who are about to die salute you

  old familiar faces old scenes old
memories paraded before dave as he
sat there his chin in one hand while he
drummed on the chair arm with the
idle yet restless fingers of the other

  i dont suppose they would listen to
me he muttered but its worth taking
a chance and ill do it

chapter iii

learning the facts

pive minutes later dave barbour was
telling all and sundry that he was
fed up that he needed a rest that he
must have a rest and that no man knew
-least of all himself-when they might
expect to see him back let somebody
else tell the world what to eat and wear
he was going home and he realized for
the first time that he was intensely in
earnest about it

  i dont know that ive done the
square thing by the old town he told
himself if those of us who went
away had plugged along we might have
pulled it out of the rut but then if
we hadnt come away perhaps we never
would have known how to pull or
when

  dave began to wonder how much old
friends had changed he had become
acquainted with plenty of people in chi-
cago some of them he called friends
occasionally there had been a young
woman who stirred his pulses for he
was young and there was no reason
why his heart should not respond how-
ever the next day had seen him plunged
deeply in a problem of winning the pub-
lic to some new idea and the young
women were forgotten

  it was characteristic of dave that he
did not herald his return to setting sun
he had taken nobody into his confidence
when he boarded a freight and went
away while he rode in all the splendor
he could buy of the pullman company
for his return journey he was the per-
sonification of meekness when he
alighted from the coach and took his
bag from the porter

  henry land who used to drive a
bony horse to the station and cry aloud
that he hauled baggage was not there
any more dave recalled vaguely that
henry was dead probably the horse
was also in henrys place a flock of
flivver drivers solicited patronage by
the rise of setting sun



shouting taxi dave intrusted him-
self to one of them and told him to
drive to the leading hotel he smiled as
he gave the directions for there was only-
one hotel in setting sun and to call it
leading was to be charitable and humor-
ous at the same time

   a room with bath he told the clerk
as the latter shook his pompadour out of
weak blue eyes

  sorry mister the clerk replied
all our rooms with bath is taken i
can give you a nice room that looks out
on washington street though and
theres a bathroom not twenty feet away
from it theres a fellow in no 
thats liable to check out this afternoon
and if he does you can have his room
its got about the best bath we got

  dave checkcd his bag and started out
for a stroll he wondered who the first
person would be to recognize him if
recognition would be mutual if he
would pass old acquaintances without
knowing them the courthouse clock
struck how natural it sounded dave
suddenly decided that he had been miss-
ing those tones for ten years

  it was saturday afternoon and the
country people were in town wash-
ington street was lined with automo-
biles mostly flivvers but here and there
a big car had nosed its way up to the
curb just as the horses a few years
ago had rubbed their muzzles against
the hitch rack around the courthouse

  disappointment was beginning to be
registered on daves face nobody
seemed to know him he was not able
to find a familiar face then around a
corner came pete fleming

  well you old son of a gun pete
exclaimed as he pumped daves arm and
clapped him on the shoulder if you
aint good for a case o th sore eyes
are you travelin or goin some place

  both and neither was daves la-
conic answer ive come down to see
the old place once more thought maybe
i could win that slogan contest the

chamber of commerce is putting on it
might reduce the cost of the journey

  theyve about gave that up pete
started to explain theys a lot o

something in confidence

a discreet inquiry or two and
dave learned that ruth derby still
lived in setting sun and was teaching
in the high school she had stayed there
to take care of an invalid mother and
when the latter died ruth did not seem
to have any desire to go away

  dave found her putting her door key
under the porch mat a custom he re-
membered as one that had bridged the
gap of years

  she came down the steps as he waited
his hat off a little uncertain about how
she would greet him then she recog-
nized him extended both hands and
smiled

  i always knew that you would come
back here some day famous rich and

-and-

 yes dave prompted and-

  and unspoiled she finished
thats the greatest compliment any-
body ever paid me he told her and
as for you well-i always felt that you
would stay here and be unspoiled the
town seems to have had a deadening in-
fluence on practically everything else
if youve come back here to gloat
over setting suns fancied shortcom-
ings i wont talk to you ruth said
with a little show of feeling to me
its the dearest place in the world

  i suppose thats the other side of
main street dave suggested youve
been living on that side where folks are
friendly and run in with a fresh batch
of cookies or give you a glass of jelly
or something like that

  well nearly everybody is friendly
here ruth insisted some people are
not very friendly because they dont

know how to be i pity them because
they miss so much out of life

  they walked along together she
was going to billy dunkles shoe shop
for a pair of shoes that had been left
there to be repaired dave remembered
billy yes ruth told him billy still
dispensed philosophy with half soles
and between jobs he worked on what
he fondly hoped would be the solution
of perpetual motion

  at length they separated dave hav-
ing obtained permission to call that
night he went back downtown and
found the chamber of commerce the
secretary james byron thorpe was a
man he never had known thorpe had
moved to setting sun the year after
dave ran away

  glad to meet you mr barbour
thorpe announced when dave intro-
duced himself ive heard people here
speak of you lets see youre in the
advertising business are you not

  dave admitted that he was and
studied the secretary that worthy was
a little man nearsighted slightly
stooped and terribly in earnest in a
moment he was spouting pathetic statis-
tics about setting sun james byron
thorpe had seen a vision and in it set-
ting sun was outstripping any of the
larger cities of the middle west all
that remained to be done was to tell the
world about the advantages of the
town

  that said the secretary is where
you might be of some service to us if
you cared to participate in our gigantic
booster campaign it might be that
some of your suggestions would be
looked upon with favor by our board
of directors you never can tell as
they say you never can tell i do not
believe in passing up any pointers or
possible pointers no matter how trivial
they may seem to others

  dave asked when he could meet the
board of directors

  well now lets see and thorpe
the rise of setting sun



mused a moment this is choir-prac-
tice night and mr johnson could not
come mr blake went to monroe on
no  and probably will not return until
late mr sticken is absent from our
city and serving on the federal grand
jury up at the state capital no it
wouldnt be possible to have a meeting
to-night but to-morrow night-i
might call a meeting then

  so it was arranged dave met with
the board and listened the members
tried to draw him out but he insisted
that he must hear their suggestions first
one thought that what the city needed
was a free tourist camp another was
certain that signboards along the high-
ways would be the thing a third placed
great faith in the slogan contest

  they worked at cross purposes but
were as one in their enthusiasm for the
place they yearned for a chance to be
able to say that their home town was
famous for something that a certain
element about the place would attract
people and thereby swell the population

  see here said dave after the
others had finished i went away
from this place ten years ago and left it
flat on its back

  he paused and smiled to show them
hat he was trying to be funny in a
mild way at length they smiled with
iim

  ive come back now he continued
with the interest to pay on the debt i
owe setting sun was reasonably good
to me all these years while you men
have been struggling with its problems
ive been up there in chicago getting
rich i hope youll pardon me when i
say that ive had some success in writ-
ing advertisements that persuaded people
to do things now heres my proposal
turn this problem of increasing popula-
tion and making the town known over
to me ill finance it and agree to get
results if i fail an amount equal to
what i have spent will be donated to
your organization all i ask is a free

hand and the privilege of spending my
own money

  they looked at each other and then at
dave they realized at length that he
was entirely sober they were not so
certain that he was mentally all there
however they accepted his proposal

  just one thing mr barbour sug-
gested thorpe as the meeting was break-
ing up doubtless you recall a tract
of timber that has been known for a
great many years as howlands woods

  i played there when i was a boy
replied dave

  well the secretary went on
hiram howland is an old man now
and he wishes to sell the grove it is
wholly within our corporate limits and
it contains about twenty acres of as fine
walnut timber as can be found in the
state some say it is the largest grove
of walnut we have left as i was say-
ing hiram is willing to sell we have
been discussing here in our meetings
what a splendid thing it would be if we
could raise the money to buy those
woods and donate them to some fur-
niture factory

  you see thorpe continued that
would be our bonus to get a new in-
dustrial plant the factory would come
it would bring many families with it
our population would grow and as the
factory succeeded we might be able to
attract others mr barbour you have
no notion how many board feet of
veneers we could get from the walnut
trees in howlands woods then after
the timber had been cut we could plant
the twenty acres and sell the lots to the
new residents its quite a scheme
mr barbour but as you can see weve
never exactly been able to finance it

  dave thanked him for the suggestion
and went down in setting suns anly
elevator it ran by water power and
he could have beaten it down the stairs
from the third floor where the chamber
of commerce offices were situated how-
ever he realized that setting sun looked


top-notch magazine

upon this elevator as a bond linking it
with modern cities

  that night dave told ruth something
in confidence he unfolded to her a
plan which was at the same time a
scheme she hesitated at first but he
had sold merchandise to people who did
not believe they cared to buy he was
persuasive but more than that he was
convincing

  shortly after that dave went away
promising to return within a few days
the reason he left setting sun was be-
cause he did not care to be there when
the blow fell he had taken space in
newspapers of cincinnati cleveland
columbus louisville indianapolis and
other cities of the territory he wished
to reach even taking a flyer in chicago
papers and putting a feeler out in new
york

  through these mediums he sought to
tell a few millions of readers that if they
were tired of hurry and bustle if they
were fed up on the jazz age bright
lights noise strife competition slogans
banquets parties dances week-ends-
all the modern inventions that rob one
of his peace and quiet his health and
happiness-then setting sun offered
them a restful haven

  it was a place where they did not
have to dress for dinner where they
did not have to get up early in the
morning or stay up late at night it
offered natural beauty rocks and rills
shady nooks and wooded hills but it
positively abhorred anybody who hap-
pened to think he was in a hurry

  the reader got the impression that
setting suns other name was sleepy
hollow he had the feeling that he
was going to yawn before he finished
the advertisement and usually did so
then his memory carried him back to
some place he had known in his youth
-a place he had visited only to find that
jazz had taken it over that aunt mol-
lys old home was now a road house and
they were dancing in the public square

while the saxophone wailed through
some brand of blues

chapter v

an idea to sell

at first setting sun was shocked hu-
miliated then blazing mad james
byron thorpe put on his sunday suit
and straightened his shoulders there
was talk of damage suits of stern re-
prisals it was even suggested that
when that smart alec dave barbour
returned to setting sun they might as
well take him riding on a rail after
having given him a coating of tar and
feathers with their best regards

  james byron thorpe sat in his little
office endeavoring to fashion a state-
ment for the setting sun enterprise
it bristled with such words as traitor
base ingratitude hustling community
of proud progress and others equally
potent he marched into the enterprise
office with it and the editor threw it
into the wastebasket

  lets wait a bit advised the editor
im beginning to smell a mice maybe
im no more farsighted than some of
the rest of you but ive got a hunch
he fished the communication out of
the wastebasket and jabbed it on a hook
suppose we let it ride for a day or so
he counseled and see what happens
nothing happened all that day and
the next except indignation meetings
neighbors went to see ruth and quizzed
her she made no defense of dave
apparently she was as sorry as all the
others

  then the postman put a bigger pile
of letters on james byron thorpes
desk than ever had been put there be-
fore they came from all over the
country from men who were tired and
wanted some place where they actually
could rest without all modern con-
veniences was it true that setting
sun was a quiet place did they have
good food could it be true that there
the rise of setting sun



was no factory in the town was it
possible that in this day and age a city
of five thousand inhabitants had no jazz
orchestra 

  the secretary of the chamber of com-
merce was both stumped and swamped
he was polishing his spectacles for the
tenth time when his door opened and
dave barbour came in

  sir ill have you know-

  shut up commanded dave i
know what youre going to say youll
have me know that i have wounded
setting suns pride that ive damaged
the towns reputation and ive played
the devil generally well you havent
heard anything yet you didnt have a
single thing in this place whereby
you could go into competition with
towns that are really up and coming
what was there to do i capitalized
all the alleged shortcomings of setting
sun and wrote some copy you thought
all these things were drawbacks and
you were ashamed of them you were
ashamed for the world to know the
truth thats all i did i told the truth
about setting sun and now look at the
mail on your desk

  b-but-youve-youve humiliated us
before the nation thorpe contended

  a little humiliation is good for the
liver was daves dry comment now
lets get busy get me a stenographer
who knows how to stenog and ill show
you some results

  within a week real-estate values were
booming in setting sun tired business
men from various cities had been yearn-
ing for such a city without really know-
ing how weary they were of the daily
and nightly grind daves advertise-
ments lured them on he played with
flagstone pavements and grass growing
between the flags he wrote about the
quiet shady streets with never a word
about a single thing that had a modern
tag there was a back-home appeal
about his copy he had an idea to sell
and hundreds were ready to buy it

chapter vi

only one provision

it was late summer in setting sun

  the population had increased by
leaps and hounds all of the vacant
houses were rented and many a home
had been sold for more money than the
owner had dreamed would be paid
carpenters were busily engaged decorat-
ing vacant lots with bungalows

  all through a lazy summer the new
residents of setting sun had been rest-
ing they had come there to retire and
they were busily engaged in telling all
and sundry that they had retired

  now a retired farmer retires and
thats all tlere is fo it he moves to
town and stops work dave knew that
from observation and experience also
he knew something else but he did not
tell everybody about it not right away
he waited to see if his belief would
come true

  with the first hint of fall some of
the retired captains of finance became
a little restless as they met each other
on the streets and in different homes
they seemed to yearn for something
dave believed that the time was ripe and
wrote to a friend to come on jimmy
burkett arrived and talked to the editor
of the enterprise

  a mass meeting was called and
everybody went jimmy burkett spoke
he said that everybody in the country
had heard about setting suns experi-
ment in the simple life the newspapers
had discussed it editorially magazine
writers had investigated it and written
that here was a new arcady

  but-were these men who had made
a success of industry of finance of the
law of various things satisfied to be
quiet all the rest of their days were
they convinced that setting sun always
should be known as the town that died
of sleeping sickness

  the only reason his questions were
not answered by a hoarse bellow is be-


top-notch magazine

cause hoarse bellows come only from
mobs jimmy burketts audience was
composed of gentlemen and their fami-
lies if there had been a dotted line
they would have walked right up and
signed on it

  what they did do was to ask burkett
to stay over the next day they offered
him ten thousand dollars a year to be-
come a citizen and run the chamber of
commerce each of the new residents
had influence and money

  in five years from now setting sun
will have a population of twenty-five to
forty thousand one of them declared
and when i say that im making a
very conservative estimate now lets
get busy and bring some industries in
here i guess well make some of these
towns laugh out of the other side of
their mouths before long i was getting
mighty tired of this rest business any-
how

  dave barbour was going back to chi-
cago he had done his work had paid
his debt to setting sun he smiled
when he heard they were changing the
name to rising sun as soon as the legal
procedure could be arranged

  it was the reverse english that got
them he told ruth as they strolled
along a quiet street together first i
convinced them that they were tired
and after they were rested i knew what
would happen you cant keep a good
man quiet any more than you can keep
him down

  they talked but little as they walked
toward howlands woods

  to think dave exclaimed that
james byron thorpe the little boob
would have cut down all those walnut
trees and sold them to make veneered
furniture

  he glanced down at ruth who was
slrangely quiet almost as brilliant as
the harvest moon to come was the great
burnished shield that hung in the sky
above them the moonlight clothed
ruth with a new beauty made her even

more lovely to dave than ever she had
been before

  they were standing now among the
stately old trees listening to the whis-
pering of the leaves as a vagrant breeze
stirred them a few more steps and
their path was impeded by a log to
each of them came a memory and the
realization that it was the same log

where ten years before-

  oh by the way said dave i
bought these woods got them for
twenty thousand i did that the first
thing after i heard thorpes talk about
furniture and veneers also i was get-
ting in on the ground floor before thfe
rise started im going to give it to the
town for a park with only one pro-
vision

  and that ruth turned to him
and that is that they leave this old
log right here where it is for me its
woodman spare the trees touch not a
single bough-and leave that old log
undisturbed for i must kiss you now
and he did

a treat for the elk

  an obscure poet took his wife and
his eight childrenj to the zoov the
children had made repeated demands to
see the elk so the poet pleaded with the
man at the turnstile

  im a poet he said and i have a
wife and eight children can we get
in to see the elk without paying the full
price 

  the man at the turnstile craned out
of his little box

  half a minute he said you are
a poet that is your wife and those
are your eight children and you want
to have a look at the elk

  exactly said the poet

  if you wait a second said the man
ill fetch the elk along to have a look
at you

all the rage

ell friends the wise crackers
have it that history repeats it-
self so i guess little martha
sherwin boss of a circulatin
library in an uptown drug
store aint the first queen since cleo-
patra thats gummed up the pages of
human progress at the least she sure
caused some rapid changes in the fis-
tiana-yearbook records however when
she told kilts mcfee the ace of my
pugilistic stable and middle champ of
the world that he was too old for her
to marry

  of course that was only her excuse
to let him down easy and you really
could hardly blame her for givin him
the go-by when he calls on her-after
weve been away doin the vaudeville
circuit for three months-with a pound
box of chocolates to show his generosity
and that absence makes the heart grow
fonder

  it wasnt that mcfee was stingy ex-
actly he was only scotch-like i tried
to tell her but she had her own ideas
on the subject and she let me down

complete in this issue

flat as a fixer when i furthermore ex-
plained that mcfee had taken her may
and december prattle serious and was
all gloomed up to drop his title to
micky flynn the hard-sockin son of
erin in their forthcomin mill

  as a matter of fact kilts mcfee
was only thirty-two and a prime athlete
yet with plenty of championship slam-
bango class to tip over a dozen biffers
that fought as wide open as monte
carlo like flynn did but my boy had
got to thinkin he was a relic and once
a box artist begins to imagine hes slip-
pin-well you know

  that was exactly what happened its
expectin too much of a boxin manager
to ask him to chew over the tragedy of
his champion binglers waterloo but
everybody that saw the meetin or reads
the spotting green knows that mcfee
entered the arena as far off his feed as
kalamazoo from miami also those
that sat in at the session saw the slug-
gin irishman knock my entry stiffer
than one of old king tuts petrified
greyhounds in the second

  however nobody but kilts mcfee
and yours truly know the bitter truths
i spilled to his cauliflower listeners


top-notch magazine

down in trainin quarters the morning-
after the night before but mcfee only
pulled a poker face and repeated the
silly little patter hed hypnotized him-
self into believin

  martha was right he kept sayin
im gettin old i did my level best
last night but flynn was too good for
me im a has-been jack

  i guess id heard this about a hundred
times when the door opened and in
breezed stan jones my college-fed press
agent and idea specialist de luxe id
sent him south to look over a promisin
young heavy that was setting the mis-
sissippi valley afire and so hed missed
mcfees flivver but hed heard all
about it never fear

  well well he began as per cus-
tom before hed got the door half open
the sword of damocles hath fallen

eh history repeats itself and-

  forget it i snarled at him may-
be you dont know it but right now
you and me and kilts are worse off
than the three musketeers without any
muskets in other words it looks like
well have to go to work for a livin
thats tragedy aint it

  yea verily jones replied feelingly
but i dont descend to the ignominy of
toil without a terrible struggle first
not me so lets get busy whats
the inside dope now on kilts here flop-
pin to an easy-mark like flynn

  well i gave him the lay-which
didnt faze him at all however

  boola boola bosh and bunk said
the idea merchant when i finished
people dont get old nowadays if
thats all the matter ill have kilts run-
nin around in a pair of rompers in a
couple of months and stealing jam out
of the pantry but this one is too easy
he expanded with his usual modesty

  glands thats the answer jones
went on theyre all the rage this
season and theres a young medico
named booth right here in the city thats
making his pile doing the job accord-

ing to report he can make an octogena-
rian dance the spanish tangofango in
nothing flat after having one of these

glands transplanted in him and-

  i aint any octogenarian mcfee
hollered insulted and one-stepped over
toward jones with his fists up and
youre dizzy if you think you can make
a ballet dancer out of me by feedin me
goat steak

  now look here kilts i cried
lets get the low-down on this doc
booths childhood elixir before com-
mittin assault and battery in the col-
lege degree you want to get your
championship belt back dont you  and
maybe this stuff will make you so youth-
ful that marthall call a referendum on
that methuselah line she gave you
this at last pacified mcfee enough
to save the life of one press agent-for
the time bein at the least but ill gool
him sure the boxer said if he dont
lay off me with this rah-rah lingo and
talk american i want to know it when
im being insulted

chapter ii

meeting a slick bird

yiith his best college manner jones
made the date over the phone and
the next p m the press agent mcfee
and myself headed for booths office
for a preliminary hearin i didnt take
much stock in this youth restorin un-
derstand but id figured it out that it
would at least force kilts to lay low for
a while and rest which is really all
that ailed him accordin to my private
diagnosis he was staler than bakery
bread on monday morning from our
long vaudeville tour and he took on
flynn against my advice before hed
got back into good ring form the
broken heart i figured would mend it-
self in time

  well this young sawbones of a doc-
tor had a flat that john d himself
wouldnt have sneezed at he was a
pep wanted



slick bird too with black hair and an
ambitious business eye and he wasnt
anybodys fool-as i and you are slated
to find out he examined my boy and
after the usual terribly-rushed-these-
days stall agreed to take on the job-
for a reasonable fee

  what do you mean-reasonable
asked kilts mcfee

  i was just coming to that said the
gland farmer ordinarily my fee for
such cases is two thousand dollars
however-and the medicos eyes had
a fishy look in em the reason for which
i didnt tumble to till later-however
ive never had a patient just like you
before i dont know absolutely that i
can benefit you so im disposed to let
the matter of fee hang fire after youre
on your feet again you can reimburse
me according to the benefit you feel my
work has done you hows that

  fine chortled mcfee that
suits me kayo

  and so it come to pass that mcfee
leased a hospital room and was put un-
der the treatment of the great doctor
booth almost at once ill admit i
could see a big improvement and mc-
fee felt it too in fact at the end of
the second week he nearly bowled me
over with a startling symptom of re-
covery plus

  better make out that check for the
two grand for the doc and leave it here
for me to give him mcfee told me
hes certainly puttin the hop back into
me and the jacks coming to him fair
enough thats a lot of mazuma for
goat meat-he sighed-but when you
run acrost a square shooter you got to
fade him on the high and handsome

  so i made out the check for mcfee
to sign and was about ready to breeze
when a new blow falls jones came
bustlin in

  flynns manager has heard were in
dry dock and has made a play about
bein ready to give us a return go-im-
mediately he related the four-

flusher has sent a letter to all the sport-
ing sheets for publication that flynn
is goin to be a fighting champ also
that theyre all set to give us a return
go-no later than a month from now
get the point

  i got it it was the old rush act
my boy accordin to doctor booth
wouldnt possibly be released for work
for two weeks more yet and bein soft
from the long rest up he couldnt hardly
train right for the agile irishman in the
remaining time but we had to call the
new champs bluff or forfeit our last
hope of regainin the crown for flynns
manager was cagy enough to know
wed taken the count on a off night and
that his man couldnt repeat when we
was goin right so i sent jones down
to sign up for us at once

  what surprised me though was the
way kilts mcfee took it he was as
chipper over it as a kid and didnt seem
to worry at all that he was goin to be
awful cramped on trainin time

  dont you fret jack he said with
a grin this gland stuff is the kayo
and ill battle this goofy champion off
his numbertens when we scramble to-
gether again

  well i beat it before kilts caught on
how doubtful i really was but id hard-
ly gone a block when i bumped into
martha slier win

  hows kilts she asked me hesi-
tantly after steerin the conversation to-
ward the proper openin for a minute

  why he seemed to be cornin along
fine when i left him at the hospital just
now i said and theres no cause
for worry really hes under the care
of the best specialist in the city young
doctor radford booth

  radford booth the hospital she
cried thats certainly all news to me
and the doctor didnt mention a word

about it to me when- and she

stopped sort of confused

  you know booth then i asked
her


top-notch magazine

  yes i know him-quite well she
admitted i-he comes quite frequent-
ly into the drug store where i work in
fact ive gone out with him before-
and after-kilts and i had our little
trouble he hates kilts

  nonsense hes treatin the boy
fine i returned and told her all about
it furthermore were cornin along
so swell that weve signed up for a re-
turn bout with micky flynn

  just the same im afraid said the
girl the doctor-well hes dreadful-
ly jealous and that might lead him to
injure kilts while hes in his power he
could do it very easily without anybody
being the wiser and of a sudden she
broke down and started in to dab her
eyes and i thought kilts stingy i
misjudged him when he was ill and too

brave to complain i-i-

  then why the tears  i tried to con-
sole her and kilts will be only too
tickled to make up  guess if youre
over bein sore with him

  of course im not angry with him
-now that i understand she smiled
at me shakily and i didnt ever want
him to squander his money on me for
expensive presents i only wanted him
to want to dont you see

  i didnt so i did the next best thing
i invited her to go back to the hospital
with me as a sort of little glad surprise
for mcfee and it turned out to be a
wild surprise ill radio mars and way
points inside our private room doc
booth was sittin at mcfees bedside-
whod just passed over the check for
the two thousand and its a stand-off
which one of em is knocked the dizzier
by our dramatic entrance

  martha what in heavens name
are you doing here dear asked the
doc and it was plain to be seen that he
was a trifle nonplused as it were

  martha echoed kilts where
does this zobo get that dear stuff at
he sat up wildlike and he looked from
martha to the doc with his lips fight and

his eyes gone hard booth booth
he repeated sort of to himself so this
fly sawbones is the booth you was keep-
in company with and quit on my ac-
count hey yeah and i trusted you

  where are my clothes mcfee
asked me loudly im goin to get up
booth hey well his namell be mud
when i get my hands on him

  but the doc showed rare judgment in
the emergency naturally mcfee
couldnt do murder in pajamas in front
of a lady and the doc saw he had plenty
of time to blow which he did martha
blew with him too her head up proud
and she never looked back once as she
swept down the hall

chapter iii

that scheming doctor

coon after i had got mcfee from
the hospital i had a guaranteed
m d look him over-the same pro-
nouiicin my boy absolutely perfect ex-
cept n as to gray matter which is only
a side line with him anyhow and no
cause for worry

  moreover on account of the fine rest
hed had my entry was in tiptop fettle
for the trainin grind ahead and with
that added to the bone he had to pick
with this rush actor flynn it was only
natural that he went to work like a raw-
meat eater right from the start the
work-outs had a vicious snap to em
that was good to see and before long
he was down nearly to the weight again
and his old form was fast cornin home
to roost

  and everything went as hunky-dory
as you could ask right up to the day
before the battle which im telling you
is the jinx day in the fistic game mc-
fee had wound up training that p m
and im not boostin him a bit when i
say he was back in his old championship
form everything was there-stamina
footwork clever and accurate boxin
and mcfee knew it
pep wanted



  no matter how much i hate booth
for keepin me in bed sos he could have
a clear field with martha he confided
while he was dressin i got to admit
he put me back on my feet then he
sighed i wonder what shes doin
now 

  i sidetracked this idea quick by send-
in him and stan jones off to a comedy
show after which i took a little tour
of the sporting circles by way of re-
creation and i discovered that the
odds had taken a big jump for micky
flynn to cop a bird named booth
has put up ten grand that flynn will
kayo mcfee i was told confidential
by one of the gamblin fraternity
which wasnt exactly soothin news
to yours truly

  but it was the next p m when the
boomerang really hit back it was the
afternoon before the mill remember
and i was sittin in my office daydream-
in-when in trotted martha sherwin
she was really agitated and so was i
when her story unfolded

  i suspected the doctor right from the
start she raced along and-and so i
guess i led him on a little to get at the
truth and i was right he boasted to
me last night that kilts would never
win his fight with mr flynn and

that-

  impossible i interrupted kiltsll
eat the fellow alive

  you dont know doctor booth
the girl remonstrated hes a mar-
velous surgeon-but absolutely un-
scrupulous ive found that out he
told me everything last night he didnt
give kilts the gland treatment at all
he didnt i gasped

  no she hurried on he said that
kilts didnt need rejuvenation to begin
with that he was a perfect athlete-
except for a worn-down and depressed
condition

  well i said shrugging the doc
told him to pay only for the good he
thought the treatment had done him so

there aint a hope for a comeback and
at that it was worth it if it only gave
the boy back his confidence-which it
seems to have done

  but doctor booth has some scheme
to make kilts lose she finished he
wouldnt tell me what it was but hes
sure it will work and dont breathe a
word to kilts that i came here to see
you she said from the doorway i
-i hate him

  which went for riley and the swiss
marines but i promised just the same
i was worried too over what shed
said though i tried to hide it

  and stan jones couldnt figure it out
any more than i could when i gave him
the lay all we can do is guard kilts
from talkin with any one he advised
and if he doesnt get in touch with any
stranger i dont see how booth can put
over his stunt-whatever it is

  we did guard the boy too and fur-
thermore we got him into the ring with-
out his havin exchanged speech with
anybody we werent sure of

chapter iv

all set

tthe fateful hour was at hand the
biggest crowd of the season had
turned out to see kilts mcfee stage his
comeback for the papers thanks to
jones had been givin us columns about
mcfees bein out for business in this
return set-to

  and he was he came into the arena
all set and it did my heart good to see
the way he carried himself confidence
say it radiated from him and when
he and flynn got together with the ref-
eree my boy gave his playmate the cold
eye and said you want to keep cov-
ered micky boy because im goin to
smack you for a home run the second
you open up this was the proper
spirit i figured

  then the gong busts into the buzz of
voices-the timekeeper callin for round

one the fight was on the battlers
touched gloves circlin each other mc-
fee hitched up his trunks with a quick
nervous jerk flynn sent a last quick
look to his corner the seconds had
ducked down out of the ring the house
was dead silent for a second-like it
always is when a mill begins the fans
were craning forward spellbound by
the openin of a mill that would car-
ry a world championship crown to the
winner

  then suddenly into the silence a voice
blared forth ba-a-a ba-a-a it
chortled

  what in the name of jim corbett
said jones who occupied a ringside seat
beside me

  ba-a-a ba-a-a rang forth the
voice again in a pretty fair imitation
of a billy goat and this time i saw
that it came from-sittin pretty in an-
other ringside seat down the line from
us-his nibs doc booth

  the fans had woke up kilts mcfee
was in on top of his man like greased
lightnin and the spectators were get-
tin excited booths mouth was still
open but it couldnt be heard any more
with his dignity throwed to the four
winds and his black vandyke workin
up and down he actually looked some-
thin like a goat

  up in the ring flynn had grabbed
kilts mcfee in a desperate clinch as
soon as he could after the doc started
ballyhooin and while my boy was
wrestlin him around and tryin to break
free flynn was whisperin a deadly
secret to him we couldnt hear it of
course but it evidently meant a lot to
mcfee you could almost see the con-
fidence and pep leavin him and the old
fighting spirit goin into total eclipse

  from then on that first round was a
nightmare mcfee after that beginnin
flash he showed before micky flynn
talked to him just settled down to tak-
in a beatin-with only a feeble effort
at reprisal  and he returned to his

corner at the finish of the round bat-
tered hopeless and dead on his feet

  for the love of mud whats the mat-
ter boy i asked him while his sec-
onds worked over him frantically

  booth double crossed me mcfee
panted he didnt give me any re-
juvenating cure at all and hes put
flynn wise to it too im due to get
copped again-i can feel it cornin
the secret was out booth had put
it over pretty and i was so absolutely
foozled that for once i couldnt put up
an argument martha was right-this
medico was clever

  well round two starts out the same
as before mcfee was takin the pastin
of his life there was only one redeem-
in feature-kilts in wonderful condi-
tion was still standin up under mickys
hammerin and theyre always danger-
ous till theyre counted out

  but id given up completely not so
with jones however praise be the
idea expert sat in deep thought for only
a shake after i gave him the line then
he began to squirm around in his seat
whisperin to himself his face grim

  flynn staggered my boy again and
jones groans

  i got to do it he whispered i
got to lord if kilts can only last the
round until i can put a buzzer in his
bonnet

  what i asked

  you sit tight and let me handle this
he said and dont you dare go near
the ring until the battles over youre
liable to queer my play kilts may mur-
der me afterward but im goin to put
the old tnt back into him or know
the reason why no plug medico can
put the indian sign on me and get away
with it if kilts can only hold up until
i can get to him-if he only can
that looked doubtful the lad was
throwin himself into a clinch every
chance he got but the referee was get-
tin sore and strong armin him loose the
second he grabbed and each time they
pep wanted



broke flynn brought over a killin
swing but mcfee was the boy to take
em when he had to-and he did it got
to be a regular formula in fact hed
take a stiff one sag a little pull himself
up-but slower every time-and clinch
then a break and theyd do it all over
again

  at first the fans booed mcfee but
after seein what punishment he was
spongin up they began to be lost in
wonder there wasnt a thread of yel-
low in him they could see that even if
he was as bad off as a polar bear along
the equator and after three minutes
of the most disagreeable manhandlin i
ever saw a battler take mcfee stiff
legged it to his corner and slumped onto
his stool

  sit tight do you get me jones
cried in my ear and rushed up to the
side of our dyin gladiator

  i watched jones hypnotized for just
a split second the idea merchant poured
the magic words into mcfees right lis-
tener and the effect was immediately
apparent the honeyed words jones
spoke whatever they were did more to
stiffen up the boy than could have the
youth restorer pickled in a barrel of the
 gone-but-not-f orgotten

   jones came back to his seat grinnin
just watch was all hed tell me
flynn is goin to wish he was some-
where else from now on

chapter v

with a bang

ell i watched right away i
saw kilts mcfee take a brace on
his stool he arched his chest and
breathed deep while his small ribs were
bein massaged he came to life and
tell me old bob fitzsimmons couldnt
fight if a slow grin didnt begin to grow
on mcfees bruised pan while he gulped
in the breeze from a snappy-swung
towel

  the next session opened with a bang

i dont know who was the most sur-
prised-me the fans or one micky
flynn-but i do know it gave the
champ the biggest jolt of any when
kilts mcfee met him halfway with a
correctly timed uppercut that almost
won the three cigars

  micky flynns eyes rolled like the
briny deep his head snapped back but
he kept cornin as a ring scientist
maybe he wont never make the late
lamented marquis of queensberry trem-
ble the daisies but with his dander up
he was a sluggin fool that boy
wasnt afraid and he could take em
too

  and he did he took em and gave
em while kilts mcfee stood there fac-
in him his shoulders rockin back and
forth shiftin from left to right and
from right to left again-mcfees
whole body from the toes up back of
those drivin hammerin killin jabs and
hooks- every one of em landed fair
and clean every one of em was the old
black-bottle stuff without any antidote
except a ten-second rest and every one
of em should have toppled the slug-
gin irishman

  but they didnt micky flynn was
staying with it like a pat hand before
the draw and those big shoulders and
arms of his were workin to fast time
themselves wild swings all but the
kind that rattle the rafters when they
connect which more than a few did
-smashin clouts that trembled my boy
from head to shoe leather when they
struck

  well the spasm ended with both lads
still on their feet still thirstin for more
and still millin with everything they
had both badly roughed up they
broke clean with the bell and headed
for their corners

  of the two micky flynn was now
the worse off for visible wear and tear
while my entry though he was dog-
tired still bore up nobly under the spell
of our idea experts mysterious pepifier

worn clown to a whisper in those first
two stanzas mcfee was cornin back
stronger every minute and for an old
man he was showin quite some energy
quite the fightin scotch claret was
boilin over from a split lip and a bad
eye cut his body was pommeled and
battered from flynns mule-heel smacks
but mcfce sat there tense in his cor-
ner his muscles quiverin waitin for
the bell he was the battlin son of
the clan mcfee once more he was a
champion with a champions heart
again

  once more we were off-with the
gallery on their feet to a man roarin
shoutin clappin-carried back to the
primitive by this comeback of a beaten
ringster by this epic sluggin bee be-
tween two dead-game clean-fightin lads
who could give and take kayo punches
with a stiff lip and hearts that didnt
falter

  and the battle proceeded for two
more cantos at the same white heat
for two furious rounds those terriers
tore at each other swingin sockin
sluggin neither went down and
neither clinched it was flynns meat
this sluggin but kilts mcfee proved
right then that he wasnt a vegetarian
either

  round seven opened like a fury for
five seconds there was a glorious rally
then flynn pulled loose somehow
dragged a death dealer up from wild
borneo and caught mcfee square on
the chin-cornin in

  it was a real kayo wallop the
leather popped like a toy balloon when
it struck my hope pitched forward in
a stiff dive fiat into the canvas lie
was out the referee started the
count micky flynn stood there wab-
blin on his pins but all the time as
watchful as a cat the stands were in
a riot

  but stan jones kept his head the
idea merchant came through with his
last ace with his program crumpled

 into a makeshift megaphone he climbed
 his seat

   ba-a-a jones roared ba-a-a
 ba-a-a just like doc booth was do-
 in before our rally paralyzed his voice

   the tantalizing sound seemed to reach
 mcfee crumpled there in the resin at
 the count of five he was on his knees
 his head bumpin the canvas crazily
 beating the sense back into his dazed
 brain

   ba-a-a ba-a-a jones kept it up
 in a sort of insane carryin screech

  nine the referee swung down
his arm

   ba-a-a jones cried simultaneously

   kilts mcfee his face chalk white
 under the red smear that covered it was
 on his feet again swinging like a wild
 man

   some one in back shoved jones off
 his chair and he fell to the floor but
 flat on his back he never let up on that
 tantalizin yodel that was bringin the
 life and fight back to good old mcfee

   and the battlin scot came through
 lord how he fought in another min-
 ute he had the fightin flynn backin up
 mcfce rushed him to the ropes with
 solid drives to the body and just be-
 fore the bell rang my ring expert
 planted his man with a final bulls-eye

 	to the jaw

   it was a wind buster and flynn was
 through he cuddled the mat for ten
 and out-and then some

chapter vi

treating hist gently

defore long jones and i climbed
the ropes to escort our worlds
champion bad to his dressin room in
state ke was standin there in the
center of the arena vet grinnin like
a hypnotized goofy i once saw his
glance searchin out through the still
petrified crowd

   only one cash customer had left the
 ringside and a sad-lookin gazabo he
pep wanted



 was doin a dismal march to the nearest
 exit it was that double-crossin gland
 gardener doc booth m d and this
 practitioner sure looked sick enough to
 try one of his own prescriptions

  mcfee spotted him and he tumbled
to the fact that young sawbones was
strugglin out under a capacity load of
grief which the boxer couldnt improve
on by a personal interview

  i guess that settles him mcfee
turned unwillingly from the mournful
but satisfyin fadeout with an arm of
the winner draped around the shoulders
of me and jones each and with the
police reserves plowin a trail for us
through the cheerin mob we made a
grand triumphal passage to our dress-
in room

  and it was in there while mcfee
was bein rubbed down that i began to
smell a rodent in the immediate vicinity
my man told his handler not to mind
his body so much but to patch up his
face and to do it as quick as possible

  im steppin out to-night mcfee
said and ive got to look halfways
presentable

  steppin out jones echoed in a
shrill falsetto youre crazy man
youre all beaten up and besides your
face looks like mince pie

  but mcfee just tossed him a meanin
wink like the idea specialist has been
kiddin him with a hot one yes im
steppin mcfee answered complacent-
ly and you know where you old fakir
get me a taxi in line wont you stan
like the good scout you are

  this puzzled me considerable par-
ticularly as i piped a sort of pallid and
frightened look come into jones eyes
when mcfee turned away and know-
in the idea merchant as i did it didnt
take much savvy to figure hed over-
played his hand pretty bad somewhere
in the near past and hadnt drawn paste-
boards to cover

  but jones showed true to form as i
expected by musterin a hearty but hol-

low laugh and saying sure kilts
anythin to oblige but he came back
in a jiffy sayin that the only cars in
sight had been spoken for

  buy one then mcfeed cried ex-
citedly buy one what do i care
for expense this is my night to
celebrate

  so jones had to do it he rounded
up one of the taxicab brethren and
had him pilot his chariot to the curb
but jones was pretty pale under the gills
when he returned

  when mcfee took his hurried depar-
ture the idea expert went to pieces
completely good lord ive got in
wrong this time he confessed in one
of those im-a-poor-sinner-save-me
wails kilts will murder me when he
finds out i had to do it it was the
only way to get him to fight but itll
mean my finish sure if he ever lamps
me when he comes back from that taxi
ride

  whats the big idea i wanted to
know you seemed the best of friends
at partin

  them days are gone forever
moaned jones i told him his sweetie
had sent word shed marry him if he
kayoed flynn and that shed sacrifice
her heart and hand to doctor booth if
kilts flivvered the go

  wow i said ill say you did
get into something stan you better
begin packin now then a dizzy idea
came to me and i stopped in my
pocket memo book was marthas phone
number which shed given me in case
of emergency when kilts was in the
hospital and that emergency was
now

  jones i told him heres miss
sherwins call number and its up to
you to do some quick fixin-before
kilts gets there first and wrecks the lay
lubricate your words boy and talk
convincin-and fast theres a phone
in the box office i think

  jones followed directions-almost

miss sherwin he said when he got
martha on the line this is kilts mc-
fees manager speakin and-

  lay off i interrupted

  yes mr mcfees manager jones
continued like he was prayin some-
thin awful has occurred    no no
kilts hasnt ireen hurt-that is not bad-
ly-but hes been terribly punished and
hes still light-headed he got away
from us after winnin the fight but his
brain is temporarily affected and hes
rushin up to see you in a taxi under
the impression that you have sent word
that youll accept his suit now that hes
again a champion    yes a halluci-
nation of course due entirely to his
condition but the shock might work a
permanent injury if you were to disil-
lusion him at once    yes yes i
knew youd agree with me so handle

him gently for all our sakes wont

you

  jones gulped in a deep breath before
goin on then the line went suddenly
dead at the other end and jones sagged
back weakly with the receiver danglin
from his fingers the doorbell rang
-i could hear it over the line he
cried to me gasping hes come and
shes gone to meet him but she prom-
ised to treat him as gently as possible

  and martha did very much so

  that may explain why one idea mer-
chant is this day partin of his own free
will with a full months salary for a
chest of sterling-silver chow implements
-with joy and gratitude in his heart
the package is liberally sprinkled with

  poppy dreams

          by pat costello

 doppies crimson in a field
 far across the sea
 underneath them are concealed
 relics dear to me

 poppies plucked from over there
 grace each vase of mine
 faded but they blossomed where
 lonely breezes whine

 poppies blood-red like that part
 shed by those who fell

 maybe my pal stained their heart
 vivid who can tell
those hated horns

harold de polo-

she little pekingese felt ex-
tremely out of place in this
backwoods cabin close to the
new brunswick border not
that sen-sen exactly disliked
the crude surroundings or the remark-
able change of diet but he decidedly
missed the companionship of the other
dogs that had been in the household
wherein he had formerly dwelt so
far as the people themselves were con-
cerned he wasnt quite sure that he
didnt prefer them the lean and
gray-eyed man and the kindly and smil-
ing woman anyway didnt pester him
to death with their pampering

  all in all sen-sen was not tremen-
dously sorry that his master and mis-
tress when they had come up  to
their hunting camp in the wilds had
presented him to this other man who
guided for them every season no
the complete change really was rather
amusing if only he was able to have
some animal companionship

  from his warm spot in the sunny
window where he was languidly reclin-
ing sen-sen looked out at the pleasant
clearing about the wilderness home it
was a late autumn day with a typical
indian-summer sun that further glori-
fied the reds and golds and yellows of
the trees that fringed the property it

was a gorgeous sight and sen-sen liked
it he had never had that in the big
city where his only real outings had
been his walks on the end of a leash
along hard pavements his two other
friends of his own breed were certain-
ly missing all this they were getting
asphalt and annoying collars and
cramped apartment quarters

  around the corner of the small barn
then there came into view the farm
creature who was really at the bottom
of all sen-sens mental disturbance-
lucy the ancient brindle cow he had
liked her quite sincerely at first but
upon closer acquaintance he had found
that the cow had an atrocious habit of
tossing her head about this in itself
would not have been so bad if she had
not had those long and curly horns
somehow they frightened him for they
always brought up a vision of himself be-
ing impaled upon one of them and such
a vision was not pleasant in fact it
caused a shudder to run along his spine
so as she always insisted on playfully
using those horns sen-sen had settled
the matter by absolutely refusing to
have anything further to do with her
but it was lonesome-mighty lonesome

  sen-sen started to do some deep
thinking then some daring thinking
seeing that lucy was not a satisfactory

playmate what was the matter with his
going out and looking for another one
occasionally this thought had previous-
ly come to him but he had always thrust
it away immediately as being too dan-
gerous those woods off there fring-
ing the cabin seemed ominous dark
peril he had always felt lurked there
this morning however the sun bath-
ing the red and gold and yellow leaves
in its soft light somehow made the for-
est appear less formidable and even
friendly

  sen-sen made up his mind suddenly
the decision to act coming to him in a
rush that made his heart throb with ex-
citement before more sober cogitation
might cause him to change he hastily
leaped down from the window sill the
genial woman who was now his mis-
tress had gone out to the lean-to in the
rear for more wood and before she
had started to return he had made his
way to the door which she bad left open

  here he paused for the fraction of a
second he stared at the fringe of
forest doubt again assailing him but
then he saw lucy playfully toss her
head and make as if to come toward
him so casting all caution to the winds
he streaked it across the clearing as fast
as his little legs would carry him and
disappeared into the heavy timber

  sen-sen had embarked upon his great
adventure

ii

er the first hour or so the pekingese
had a grand and glorious time it
was sheer virgin wilderness into which
he had taken himself and the very big-
ness of it awed him but awed him pleas-
antly he found the woods remarkably
free from all signs of animal life and
he wondered about it not realizing that
many of the wild people no doubt were
watching from their hiding places this
decidedly strange specimen

  sen-sen barked occasionally in his
shrill high staccato and halted to await

an answer but none ever came never-
theless this did not sadden him for it
was odd and thrilling just to be out
here all alone he forgot lucy and his
master and mistress and his former
mode of existence in the joy of just
being alive on this tingling autumn day
so on he went-aimlessly on and on

  he discovered presently that he was
somewhat tired his small legs never
having been built for distance work
felt the least bit wabbly this being so
he very sensibly lay down in order to
rest himself he was not allowed much
of a respite however somewhere be-
hind him he heard a foreign noise-a
sort of woof given in a tone of sur-
prise looking around he beheld a
most interesting creature who appeared
as if he might make a charming play-
fellow

  the newcomer was round and brown
and curly-haired with awkward paws
of great size and little eyes that seemed
to squint mischievously he uttered
another grunt as sen-sen studied him
and began to amble forward with a
bearing that was one of friendliness

  as the pekingese watched the year-
ling brown bear approach he could not
help having some doubts the aspect
of this dweller of the woods as he came
closer and closer took on an air that
to sen-sen seemed almost ferocious
perhaps even though he had no horns
such as lucy possessed he had some
other weapon-hidden of course-that
might prove to be even more dangerous
than the ones worn by the farm animal

  in fact he became absolutely certain
of this when the bear had taken half a
dozen more steps and he gazed wildly
about him as his heart began to flutter
alarmingly now the peering eyes of
the other-filled with no more than
downright curiosity as a matter of fact
-impressed the dog as burning with a
light that meant murder and so com-
pletely in the grip of blind panic poor
sen-sen managed to make his nearly
those hated horns



paralyzed muscles function as he
bounded up into the air and scampered
off at a speed he had never known he
could attain

iii

pver afterward that furious retreat

   was slightly hazy to the distracted
pekingese although no part of him
was fashioned for rough going he made
a creditable record in his mad charge
through the forest through under-
brush and thorns he went over logs and
boulders across swamp and hard stub-
ble but behind him no matter where
he went or how fast he went that lum-
bering creature could always be heard
grunting

   sen-sen was not aware of course
that the lear tribe is perhaps the most
curious of all the wild folks and that
this particular young member of it had
unfalteringly determined to become
more closely acquainted with the odd
stranger he had found wandering in
his neighborhood

   at last the little dog came to the shore
of a long and narrow lake his first
impulse when he saw the body of water
was to plunge desperately into it and
try his fortune at swimming on sec-
ond thoughts however it occurred to
him that his pursuer possibly had even
more speed in the water than he had
on land also the bear was no more
than forty or fifty feet behind him so
apparently this was no time to try this
mode of retreat on the solid earth
so far he had succeeded in keeping in
the front and he therefore concluded
that it would be worse than folly to
switch his tactics he would trust to
his legs on land for just as long as he
could make them hold up under him

   when he had covered another couple
of hundred yards or so along the shore
line sen-sen realized that unless he
had a rest pretty soon his legs would
quickly give out they were trembling
with weakness now and his heart was

palpitating so swiftly and heavily that
he felt as if it would either leap out of
his throat or positively break through
his ribs

  wildly as he made his staggering
way onward lie looked about for some
place of hiding some place where he
might find a haven safely out of reach
of the bear at least until he became
rested with just a brief breathing
spell he was confident that he could re-
gain sufficient strength to allow him to
take up the retreat again and outrun his
enemy but where was this spot that
would give him a new lease on life

   as if in answer to his fervent ques-
tioning there loomed up before him a
fallen tree-a slim and once stately old
spruce that had in its crash to earth
come to rest on a huge rock that had
kept it from the ground and allowed a
good twenty feet of its tip to stretch
out over the water the mere sight of
it to sen-sen was a wonderful thing
he did not stop to think what he would
do if he once reached the end of that
perilous perch he thought only that
if he could ever get out there to the
end of it he might have a chance to
devise some other scheme before his
pursuer was able to follow such a diffi-
cult course anyway he bravely ran
along the spruce exhibiting remarkably
steady nerves and sure-footedness and
getting out at last to the very tip there
he deftly turned around clung grimly
on and faced his foe

   the young bear whose curiosity was
now more fully aroused than ever was
nevertheless too well versed in forest
lore not to pause to examine the tree
before he began the tricky journey
feeling that he now had his quarry
where he could not get away from him
he took his time as he had always been
taught to do

  he walked out a few yards very
slowly on the old spruce and then sud-
denly got down from it with phenomenal
alacrity he did not like the crackling
	top-notch

sound that had come to his ears after
a minute or two of contemplation he
decided to try it again on this occa-
sion he went no more than a foot or
two before scrambling down to earth
again the crackling noise had been
quite loud now and he had noticed that
the tip had sagged even closer to the
water so with a yawn he settled down
on his haunches to wait let the other
fellow make the first move now that he
had him cornered that was how he
felt

iv

defore very many minutes had
tz gone by sen-sen began to realize
that maybe he had catapulted himself
from the well-known frying pan into
the fire he had apparently succeeded
in discovering a place to which the bear
would not follow him mt now that he
had it what was he going to do with it
he could not get back to the solid old
earth and so far as trying to make a
swim for it went he would have even
less of a start than he would have had
before the only thing to do it seemed
was to wait to stay here on this perch
that was now becoming uncomfortable
in the hope of tiring the patience of
that placid sentry who was lazily squint-
ing at him with such a satisfied expres-
sion

   an hour went by another and still
another during this time poor little
sen-sen did a lot of fidgeting for he
found it was getting harder all the while
to keep his seat on that tip of spruce
this he had to do for the moment he
tried crawling farther down it and
nearer to the-shore his captor would
deliberately rise put his forepaws onto
the log and cause that creaking and
crackling again this was always
enough to make the dog retreat to the
end when the bear would once more
settle down on his haunches with a yawn
that intimated he had all the time in the
world to spare things looked very sad

magazine

for the little pekingese who had ven-
tured out in search of friendly com-
panionship

  from across the late however there
came to his ears at last a long-drawn
and plaintive wail-a sound very much
like that frequently made by lucy the
brindle cow only much louder sen-
sen wondered as it was repeated what
it could be the bear down there be-
low him seemed to take no notice of it
as for himself it immediately brought
back memories of the pleasant home he
had left of the kindly master and mis-
tress whom he had deserted of the
safety and protection that had been his
why oh why had he been so foolish as
to come out on this mad and futile jour-
ney  probably he would never get back
from it probably he would perish right
here without even having a chance to
swim probably-

  sen-sen never had a chance to finish
his thoughts instead he came danger-
ously close to losing his hold and tum-
bling down into the water a roar had
suddenly broken out on the stillness-
a roar that sounded like a thousand
trumpets going off all at once some-
how though sen-sen managed to re-
tain his place although his body was
trembling and his heart was beating
madly high up in his throat

  before he had much time however
to wonder about the noise it was fol-
lowed by a crashing and crackling of
underbrush and branches not a dozen
yards away from him and the dazed
little pekingese saw a mighty antlered
head appear then the whole body of
the great creature came into view-the
biggest body the dog told himself that
he had ever seen astounded and
stunned by the arrival of this latest
character on the scene sen-sen just
clung there and watched with his eyes
popping

  again came the plaintive wail from
across the lake again came that trum-
peting bellow from the giant on the
those hated horns

bank and then the powerful bull moose
with a challenging toss of his head
surged out into the water in answer to
the call of the cow

  the stranded pekingese his brain in
a wild turmoil nevertheless managed
to do some fairly sane thinking if he
stayed where he was he would never
get anywhere unless it were into the
hands of the bear then this monstrous
creature who had just started swimming
looked to be of the same breed rough-
ly as lucy perhaps the cow after all
was not as dangerous as he had thought
for if she were the people in the cabin
would probably not have her around
them anyway the immense animal
who was now almost under the spruce
was certainly going in the direction sen-
sen himseli favored and that was away
from that brown watcher

  gathering together his nerves and his
muscles sen-sen lost no time as the
moose went by beneath him the little
pekingese gritted his teeth and hurled
himself through the air in a seething
spray of water he felt his claws sink
into heavy fur and then he opened his
jaws and closed in with his teeth there
was a single toss of that antlered head
as if the bull were merely flicking away
some insignificant insect but the dog
hung on grimly the moose apparently
not further bothering with his slight
burden got into his stride and swam
along straight for the opposite shore
while his passenger with what
amounted to a grin of triumph gazed
back at the sadly disappointed bear

v

it was a tired and bedraggled little

  sen-sen that staggered into the farm-
yard toward sundown but he was hap-
py on that journey across the lake
between those sturdy antlers he had
developed a theory and now he imme-
diately put it to the test he went over
to lucy who was contentedly munching

u

the grass on his arrival she went
through her usual antics of pretending
to catch him with her horns but this
time the dog did not retreat instead
he snapped back at her and barked joy-
ously as he found that he had been right
in deciding that her horns just playfully
grazed him a great contentment over-
took him for he had made a merry
friend at last

  so being extremely tired out he
flopped down on the ground right where
he was and took a snooze while lucy
continued to munch the grass beside
him

using the boy right

  the old customer was astonished to
find one morning that instead of his
usual barber there had been assigned to
him a mere child the son of the pro-
prietor

  gracious me exclaimed the old
patron surely you dont intend this
boy to shave me

  the assistant barber paused from his
hair-cutting and going to the rear of the
shop called the proprietor the old
gentleman repeated his former question

  oh come sir cried the proprietor
dont be harsh let the boy have
his fun for once its his birthday

the versatile teacher

  with a view to learning the art of
boxing a young man went to a pro-
fessor

  soon after they had begun the first
bout the instructor floored his pupil with
a neat half hook

  i say spluttered the novice as he
struggled to rise is it necessary to
knock me down like this

  bless your heart no sir said the
old pugilist stand up and ill show
you a dozen other ways
smoked two cigarettes and then had
rolled himself in his blanket for hours
he had lain motionless in a dreamless
sleep which renewed him mind and
body the flow of an abundant vitality
was in him now it showed in his red
cheeks and in his bright gray eyes

  he was so tall a man an inch over
six feet that there was about him an
effect of slenderness however if he
had been half a dozen inches shorter
he would have been called stocky his
height b-elied the breadth of his shoul-
ders and even the actual slenderness
from the torso down did not empha-
size it

  picking up the big gray hat which he
had cast down the night before near the
saddle a saddle which had served for
a pillow in lieu of feathers he set it
on his head pulling the brim down over
his eyes the hair which the hat then
covered was reddish-brown and close-
clipped the face below the hat was
lean it was drawn so fine that there
was almost but not quite a suggestion
of hollows in the cheeks the cheek
bones jutted just slightly above these
suggested hollows

  the nose was big but straight with-
out any hint of being bulbous the
mouth was wide and full but the lips
because of their being firmly held did

the stranger by the wayside

lanting rays from the new-
ly risen sun struck athwart
the face of the man lying on
the ground and he opened
his eyes and sat up like one
to whom swift and definite awakening
is a habit also like one to whom the
consulting of the sun as a timepiece is
another habit he looked at the eastern
hills deciding that the hour was about
five he shook himself free of the tight-
ly rolled brown blanket in which he had
slumbered as peacefully as if springs
and not the hard earth had made his
couch and got easily to his feet

  that swift ease marked all his move-
ments then he went about what he
had to do noiselessly but with no effect
of attempted secrecy it was only that
he was lithe and graceful about his
tasks stumbling or fumbling would
have been like a discord

  the night before he had chosen this
hilltop for his resting place because he
had known that if there was a night
breeze he would catch it here and also
because there was some grass for the
horse which he had picketed at the edge
of a gentle slope at sundown he had
eaten a plentiful but simpu supper had
crimson trail



not seem too full for that face the
chin was the chin of a resolute man
broad with a cleft in it but not too
defiantly thrust out a rough-hewn face
it was capable it would seem of pictur-
ing many emotions but just now in the
dawn placid contented

  the mans first act was to care for
the horse he had apparently fed well
enough for there was a circle to the
end of the picket rope in every direc-
tion within which the grass had been
eaten the man freed him of the rope
and the horse a rangy bony sorrel
stood still and waited fifty feet from
where the man had slept there was a
trickle of water down the hillside with
a little pool in the rock at the bottom
leading the horse to this the man let
him drink and then he saddled and
bridled him

  fifteen minutes later having washed
eaten and smoked a cigarette the man
stepped up into the saddle he was so
tall that the act was one merely of step-
ping up not of leaping he crossed the
hilltop at a walk and set the animal
down a trail which led to a mountain
road this road leading in its turn as
he knew to a village below

  the sun was well up above these foot-
hills now with the promise of another
warm day

  just before the man left the hilltop
his eyes swept the surrounding coun-
try as far as they could reach just
beyond him there was a ragged brush-
grown ravine beyond that farther away
than the casual eye would have guessed
there were squat brown mountains de-
void of vegetation like huge potato
hills newly drawn up with the hoe
to the left of these were other moun-
tains upon which juniper trees grew
and still farther on the broken rugged
line of the higher mountains green far
up and still with a little whiteness of
snow on their peaks and in between
and beyond and to his right and his left
and behind him the man knew was

the cattle and sheep country thou-
sands of head of each were grazing
unseen all through this country

  good country the man nodded
and went on

  the descent was not marked he
covered half a mile and was not more
than fifty feet lower down than he had
been when he had left his sleeping
ground here there was a turn in the
road and the village which was his
destination was revealed to him from
now on the road sloped down steeply
ending in the hollow which chance or
design had made the site of the little
town

  the man swept the place with one
glance he had never been in it be-
fore but he knew just what it was
like it would not differ from a thou-
sand other villages of the west there
would be a hotel of a sort probably a
pretty bad hotel just possibly a first-
rate hotel sometimes these little towns
had a surge of civic pride that found
an outlet in the erection of a hotel to
the cost of which everybody far and
wide contributed

  there would be a church and a pool-
room a school and a garage one store
two or three then on each side of
these on the one main street would be
small houses that continued till they
ceased altogether and the open country
began all these would represent the
places of business and the homes of a
few men and women who had gathered
together to serve a country many miles
in extent

  no railroad as the newcomer was
aware ran within seventy-five miles of
this village those who lived there got
out of it by automobile when the roads
permitted by horse when they did not
and those who came to trade got in
by the same means freight was
brought in once a day by an automobile
truck from the county seat this ran
on a schedule but was usually several
hours late though transportation was


top-notch magazine

poor communication was better this
man now riding down to the town had
taken pains to discover that there was
a telegraph office a post office too of
course but it functioned no better than
the truck because it was dependent for
its mail service on the truck

  well horse said the man lets
slide down and see what the news is

  his eyes brightened as he spoke
there was an anticipatory interest in
those eyes as if the man expected that
whatever news there was would be in-
tensely interesting

  he was in the act of gathering up
the horse to send him into a gallop
when he saw a man sitting at the side
of the road the stranger stopped his
horse at once the fact was that there
was something in this mans attitude
which was in keeping with a tense and
critical situation which he knew would
develop in the village that day the
man did not need to be especially clever
to sense that this other man was un-
doubtedly an actor in the drama into
which the stranger himself was about
to plunge

  that the sitting man was suffering
agony of mind there could be no doubt
he had cast his hat down beside him
and had plunged both of his big
browned hands into his jet-black hair
the fingers of the hands were spread
and he ran them back through the hair
tugging at it as he pulled the fingers
forward he rocked his body from
side to side and now and then a mur-
mur came from him a little beyond
him stood a gray horse motionless its
head drooping

  the man astride the sorrel knew the
propriety of minding his own business
in this country a man was allowed to
have his troubles by himself if he so
wished and apparently this man wished
to be alone with his else he would not
have withdrawn himself as he had done
the stranger however had known all
along that he could not observe the or-

dinary amenities he had decided again
the night before while he had smoked
his cigarettes that he would have to
intrude if intrusion became necessary
besides he more than half suspected
who this man was

  anything i can do stranger he
asked gently

chapter ii

a picture of horror

i ike many rugged self-reliant men
the man on the sorrel had the strain
of gentleness in him he was not one
who being strong plunged along to the
satisfaction of his own desires he had
never been trained to be considerate of
others but he was considerate it was
a gift to him he had always been
ready to extend a helping hand and
contrariwise he had laughed off the
helping hand extended to himself or
would have done so if a helping hand
had ever been necessary for him it
had never been necessary because he
was rarely in a quarrel seeking no en-
trance to it and he had never been sick
and had infrequently been dismayed a
lucky man he was in temperament and
in body and luckier still because he
was aware of his first luck

  he did not know of course how this
man in mental pain would take his ad-
dress he was prepared for anything
-anger coldness defiance the un-
reasoning petulance of one who fights
with woe but the man displayed none
of these emotions as he slowly lifted
his head he showed only a kind of
bleakness and blankness as if he had
suffered so much that his capacity for
emotion except that dull rocking and
moaning lad passed out of him

  there was nothing shown in his
brown eyes they seemed to have been
made shallow by pain it was as if
they had been so filled with so many
things lately that they had become too
weary to mirror more they looked
crimson trail



upon the horseman but did not seem
to see him pity welled up in the
strangers heart it was as fine a pity
as any woman could have bestowed on
the hapless man it was untouched by
any scorn to which these signs of weak-
ness might have given rise be-
sides if this man was he whom the
stranger suspected him to be the
stranger was already enlisted in his
service had been enlisted in it from the
time he had set out on his hundred-
mile journey and in fact before that

  the rocking of the other mans body
had now ceased and no more murmurs
came from his lips the horseman let
him take his time only fixing his quiet
gray eyes on his face so that as he
looked into them the sitter might gather
the signs of friendliness from them
this the sitter seemed rather dully at
last to do when he spoke the horse-
man perceived that he had heard the
question addressed to him but had not
caught its meaning

  what did you say he asked

  you seem to be in trouble the
horseman said is there anything i
can do

  the man beside the road stood up
after he had lifted his hat slowly and
put it on his head he stood for a
moment looking down at the village
with that same effect of dullness

  i swear stranger he said im
just about beat out i aint had no
sleep in i dont know when i been
sittin here since midnight just like
you found me i didnt know day had
come till i looked up when you spoke
to me i been in a kind of a daze
all of us has been in a kind of daze
for a long time

  he rubbed his chin upon which there
was a heavy stubble of black beard
and then he turned his eyes back to
the horseman stranger hereabouts
aint you he asked

  yes i live north beyond the moun-
tains hundred miles or so

  he slipped down from the horse and
walked up to the man names
mcgregor he went on foreman of
a ranch up around scanlon every-
thing goin pretty good this time of
year and thought i would take a little
trip and see this part of the country
fine country isnt it

  there was a very slight kindling in
the other mans eyes it seemed for
a moment as if a tiny flame of in-
terest and pride might begin to burn
there but it died swiftly

  stranger he said im sufferin
the tortures of hell

  take it easy ol boy mcgregor
said you been tcarin yourself to
pieces with grief or worry or some-
thin if you dont let down somethin
is liable to bust inside you i reckon
you have got a fight on your hands
if there is anything i can do im right
here like i say im on a vacation
i am foot-loose for a month i got a
little money i can fight if a fight is
on

  there was not even a hint of boast-
fulness in his tone even this brain-
dulled man seemed to see that what he
said was merely for the sake of em-
phasizing his offer

  yeh the other said i can see
you stack up all right

  when did you eat last mcgregor
asked

  my name is hammersley the man
said as if he remembered that he had
not met the stranger halfway in the
matter of introduction we got a
ranch over the hills here i aint eat
nothin since-i dont know-last night
some time yesterday oh i dont re-
member 

  smoke

  hammersley fumbled in his breast
pocket but his fingers came empty out
of it dont seem to have no to-
bacco he answered

  mcgregor gave him tobacco and
papers and he rolled a cigarette with


top-notch magazine

unsteady fingers while his head was
bent to his task mcgregor studied him
he was not so tall as mcgregor by
half a head but he was thick-bodied
from his big well-poised head to his
feet he was an inordinately strong
man mcgregor believed but mcgregor
did not wonder that he was so beaten
down just now he was that kind of
man mcgregor was sure who would
face without a tremor any danger which
threatened himself alone but who
would come to this condition when he
found one he loved threatened with
himself powerless to ease the loved
ones suffering

  hammersley put the cigarette in his
mouth lighted it and inhaled deeply

  ill fix up some food for you
mcgregor said and hammersley said
nothing

  mcgregor built a guarded fire pro-
duced food and coffee from his saddle
roll and presently offered bacon sand-
wiches and a steaming cup to ham-
mersley

  hammersley cast the smoking cigar-
ette from him then habit asserted it-
self put your foot  that will
you he asked

  as mcgregor turned aside to stamp
out the butt hammersley attacked the
food he ate and drank in silence
then he lifted his head and wiped his
mouth

  you kind of caught me off my
guard mcgregor he said ill have
another cigarette if you dont mind

  the fingers with which he twisted
the cigarette together were steadier
now a foreman on a cattle ranch
comes in time to be a swift and sure
judge of men jte lias to figure what
a given man will do in a given situa-
tion mcgregor was thirty-two and
he had come to his high position young
-when he was but twenty-five he
had however been bom in the cattle
country and had been able to ride
almost as soon as he was able to walk

so that his apprenticeship had been
long enough so now mcgregor judged
that if hammersley were given a
chance if he were offered sympathetic
silence he would talk he would be
glad to ease the burden of his mind
since he seemed to trust mcgregor
with that swift trust which men who
spend much time alone know

  hammersley smoked fof a space in
silence at last he dropped the cigar-
ette in front of him and put the heel
of his boot on it murder is an awful
thing aint it mcgregor he asked

  mcgregor did not start he showed
no sign of surprise the other man
was not looking at him and he kept
his cool eyes only on the square black-
bearded face

  it is an awful thing hammersley
he agreed when hammersley did not
at once speak again

  hammersley looked up then squarely
into mcgregors eyes hammersleys
own eyes were now hot with passion
he was returning mcgregor supposed
to an earlier phase he must have
been like this at the beginning of the
drama he would have continued like
this if grief for some one else had not
torn at his heart here was a strong
man a resentful man a fighting man

  a fight that ends in a mans bein
killed aint nothin hammersley pur-
sued in a thing like that each man
gets his chance the two men are
settlin somethin but this murder im
speakin about wasnt no fair fight it
was as brutal a murder as ever was
it was done for money and how one
man can kill another man for money is
beyond me money aint so hard to
make weve made it on our ranch
not a lot but enough it gets me how
one man can sneak up behind another
and put a bullet into him killin him
on the spot just to take a wad of
money away from him

  its done though returned mc-
gregor gently
crimson trail



  done i reckon it is done it -has
been done right here in this country
right over there on the camas trail
this fella moody was known to have
money on him he was a blowhard
he came into the village with his money
in a bag and didnt make no bones about
it he was goin to buy a ranch he
had the money to pay for it trot out
your ranches men and lemme have
a look at them moody would say you
know the kind of abslute fool i
mean

  ive met up with that kind mc-
gregor said

  well they come on him lyin be-
side the trail dead as a man could be
a bullet through him a bullet throwed
into his back and the bag of money
gone

  sweat had come on hammersleys
forehead he wiped it away with a
thick forefinger terror was in his
eyes now in his brain mcgregor
knew there was a picture vastly more
horrible than the verbal picture he had
just drawn

  you got another cigarette ham-
mer sley asked

  mcgregor gave him the makings
and when hammersley had finished
rolled a cigarette for himself he
waited

  what a pack of liars men can be
hammersley grated swearin an in-
nocent mans life away a mild oath
dropped from his lips you wait
he went on if they hang that brother
of mine if they kill my sister too
doin it i will shoot the heart out of
each one of them i know they lied
they know they lied but it was four
to one them four against my brother
all by himself i spose the jury couldnt
do nothin else

  they found your brother guilty of
this murder you speak of mcgregor
asked

  hammersley put his cigarette be-
tween his lips but it had gone out

he dropped it onto the ground and
fixed his eyes on it as if he had to hold
them to something they found him
guilty he whispered and they hung
him this mornin about the time that
sun was cornin up over the hills they

hung him unless-unless-

  he could go no further he was
shaking like a man with a chill though
curiously his lips seemed to be stiff
and drawn

chapter iii

waiting for news

ctill mcgregor showed no sur-
prise hammersleys statement had
no effect upon him except to make him
continue his steady regard of the man
and he did not speak he let ham-
mersley take his time to regain a little
of his self-control

  they hung my brother unless our
lawyer got to the governor strong
enough to persuade the governor to
stop the hangin for a while at least
hammersley went on at last very
wearily but i reckon its all over
i dont suppose the governor would do
anything it would be just an ordin-
ary murder and hangin to him no
i expect my brother is dead by now
ill have to go an get him an bring
him home an bury him if the governor
hasnt done nothin

  you were expectin word this
mornin mcgregor suggested

  yes as soon as the telegraph office
opens that wont be till round eight
oclock it must be after six now i
tried to sleep last night but i couldnt
and so i set out along about midnight
an rode over here i think i been
sittin here for hours i dont know
just what time i got here

  there isnt anything we can do for
a while then mcgregor said lets
sit down an you take it as easy as you
can

they sat by the side of the road

  i got an idea they didnt hang your


top-notch magazine

brother this mornin mcgregor said
ive heard this here governor is a
pretty square sort of a chap they
say that if you can prove anything to
him he will do what is right in spite
of what anybody might say you just
keep on hopin hammersley and
while youre doin it suppose you just
gimme the inside of this thing mebbe
i could lend you a hand if the gov-
ernor should stave off the hangin we
would have to do some snappy work
mebbe an if i knew the inside of the
thing i would be ready to hop to it
why replied hammersley feebly
it aint nothin that could intrest you
mcgregor you are on a vacation you
dont want to get yourself tied up to
a thing like this and spoil all your fun
the color in mcgregors cheeks
deepened a little he leaned over and
plucked a blade of grass and put it
into his mouth as if he sought by the
simple act to cover some confusion he
felt

  i take it you are up against a gang
of crooks hammersley he went on
you are tryin to fight em all alone
and you aint in no shape to fight
youll need help im here to give it
to you why i would have to wouldnt
i thats the way the game is played
aint it

  you might be tied up for some
time hammersley pointed out

  ill stick said mcgregor quietly
ill stick for the big show

  hammersley turned his head and
looked at mcgregor he seemed to be
puzzled but in the end after his scru-
tiny his need being so great he held
out his hand if you help me he
said solemnly ill never forget it as
long as i live

  ill help you mcgregor returned
with equal solemnity now tell me
what you know

  the thing happened a coupla
months ago hammersley began my
brother had driven some cattle over to

our shippin point he had taken a
coupla men with him extra hands we
had put on in the spring they was
leavin and when he had got the cattle
off he paid them and started home
alone he come at midday to the vil-
lage down below this here fella was
there shootin off his mouth as usual
he had been hangin around the town
at the hotel for a month

  he was a tenderfoot and he was
always kiddin everybody about the
west an what a meek place it was an
all that he said he hadnt seen none
of the wildness he had read about
somebody told him once that if he
didnt quit shootin off his mouth he
would see somethin he was a big
chap an had nerve in his own way an
he told this fella to trot out what he
had to show

  well the night my brother was
restin up at the hotel was chilly and
a bunch of men was sittin around the
stove this chap come in he began
to talk right off as usual he said he
knowed where there was a ranch that
could be had cheap and he would be
leavin in the mornin to buy it

   i think itll suit me he said an
i got the money to buy an thats that

  he had that kind of a line of talk
somebody asked him where the ranch
was and he told em an they all
knowed whose ranch it was he told
em what the price was and they said
honest enough that it was a good buy
it was ol man hansens place about
twenty-five miles over here his wife
died last christmas an he wanted to
sell out him gettin old an all

  my brother was always a silent man
hes five years oldern i am he didnt
say nothin for a while an pretty soon
the men that was stayin at the hotel
drifted up to bed and the others went
home leavin my brother an this fella
alone my brother was always a polite
an considerate man and when the
stranger begun to ask him questions he
crimson trail



answered an he told this fella that
the hansen place was worth moren
hansen was askin he said he knowed
the ranch as he always had to ride by
it when he come to town an he said
he knowed hansen an anything han-
sen told the fella the fella could rely
on

   why the fella said if you go
by the hansen place me an you can
ride together in the mornin id be
glad of company i aint never been
over that way yet

  my brother said that would be all
right in the mornin about sunup
they was ready to start this fella had
a bag strapped to his saddle my
brother looked at it an he saw that it
kinda bulged

   you aint carryin money in that
bag are you he asked i heard you
talkin last night about havin your
money with you

  the fella patted the bag an said he
had the dough right in it he said he
wasnt afraid to tote it around

   i got a gun on me an i know how
to use it he said

  he must have been a bigger fool
than most men of that kind mcgregor
offered

  he was i reckon hammersley
agreed i reckon he was the worst
fool that ever hit these parts all eat
up with conceit you know

  well him and my brother rode for
twenty miles till  the camas trail
branches off to go up to hansens place
they had jogged along seein nobody
and this fella had kidded my brother
some about what my brother had
said

   this here trail is lonely my
brother said  if you like i will ride
on to hansens with you

  the fella just laughed he said my
brother could make the trip if he was
interested in seein a man grab off a
ranch in jig time but my brother said
he wouldnt be interested in nothin like

that so they laughed and parted right
there at the head of the trail

  it wasnt till toward evening that
the fellas body was found he was
lyin beside the trail dead his money
was gone every cent of it he had
been shot through the back

  how far had he gone up the trail
mcgregor asked

  there was somethin queer about
that hammersley answered just
before my brother come to a turn in
the road he looked back this here
camas trail winds up quite consider-
able and my brother could see that
this fella had rode for about a half a
mile he was still going on steady
when his body was found it was only
about five hundred feet from the head
of the trail there was marks as if
he had been shot right where the trail
begun and his body had been dragged
that far up the trail how he ever
got back there i dont know

  what were the signs mcgregor
asked

  there was blood where the body
was found and at the end of the trail
but none where my brother had last
seen this chap the men that found
the body or two of them anyway rode
up to hansens right away to see if
hansen knowed anything then han-
sen rode down with them and later
there was more ridin back and forth
on the trail so when the sheriff got
over from the county seat there was
no way of tellin whether this fella had
gone up the trail as my brother said
or not anyhow all signs indicated
that he had been shot at the end of
the trail and his body dragged up it
a ways

  you say your brother and moody
didnt meet nobody as they rode
mcgregor said what did they have
against him except that he had been
ridin with this man like anybody might
have done

  thats where the crookedness comes

in hammersley replied passionately
four men swore that they had been
up on a bench above my brother and
this man when the two of them parted
they testified that the man rode up the
camas trail a ways just like my
brother said and then that my brother
called him back they had some words
together and the man seemed to be
mad he threw out his hand at my
brother and turned and started to ride
up the trail again my brother pulled
his gun shot him in the back got
down dragged the body up to where
it was found took the bag and rode
off the men bein strangers said
they couldnt see no way but for them
to ride to the county seat and get the
sheriff they said they knowed the
man was dead before the sheriff
knowin my brother had ridden out
with the man got to our house the
body had been found

 who were these four men
mcgregor asked

  each one of em worked for a dif-
ferent outfit hammersley answered
one outfit was north one south one
east and one west they claimed they
had been to town and was ridin over
south to call on three girls that lived
in the neighborhood where one of them
worked

  tough citizens are they mc-
gregor inquired

  i dont know nothin about law
hammersley said our lawyer was
allowed to ask them some questions
about themselves like had they ever
been arrested or mixed up in trouble
an so forth but they testified they
hadnt been arrested and hadnt been
into nothin special just a little
drinkin a little gamblin a little
runnin around like some young fellas
will do their testimony stood up

  and my brother didnt have no
witnesses he had only his own word
he told about partin with this fella
an goin home he said he didnt

know the fella had been shot till the
sheriff come

  it was just one mans word against
the word of four others

  well hammersley said uneasily
there was the matter of the gun
the gun

  drivin cattle a man takes a gun
with him you know hammersley
went on my brother took his first
thing the sheriff asked him was where
was his gun when my brother got
home he had took off his belt and hung
it up layin the gun on a table in his
room he told the sheriff where it
was the sheriff went an got it and
when he come downstairs he stood
lookin at my brother with the gun in
his hand

  you fired this gun did you
henry   he asked

   why no henry answered lookin
surprised i didnt have it out of the
holster from the time i left here till
i got back

   well the sheriff said you knowed
it had been fired

   why i didnt look at it henry
replied i just stuffed it into the
holster when i was leavin

  henry aint no gunman he was
always that way about guns he would
wear one if the occasion demanded but
it was just like him not to look at it
then i see i made a mistake i made
a mistake because accusin henry had
seemed so ridiculous that i hadnt
thought it necessary to figure things
out at all

   why sheriff i said i fired that
gun

  he stood lookin at me then with a
queer kind of a smile on his lips  tell
it to me he says

   why i said you know we been
bothered with a bunch of wild horses
up this way lately they been cornin
up to the barns and the corrals in the
night and gettin our horses to millin
around them that was in the corrals
crimson trail



one of our mares got herself hung up
one night about a week ago i stayed
up layin for them it was moonlight
and pretty soon a big gray comes lopin
up to the corral he was a pretty
sight with his head flung way up and
his mane and tail streamin i always
liked a horse you know sheriff an
this big boy took my eye i made up
my mind that if he liked the place so
well i would let him make it his reglar
home

   so i went into the barn to get my
rope when i come out he was jam-
min himself up against the corral and
some of the horses inside was jammin
up on the other side this gray was
such a powerful beast i thought he
would tear the corral down i fired
one shot close over his head and then
i run toward the corral expectin to
rope him as he dashed away he was
too quick for me my rope missed
him and he was gone like a streak

   ill take you along with me
henry the sheriff said i am
accusin you of the murder of walter
woody

   why sure ill go along with you
henry said i havent done anything
sheriff

  wheres that bag the sheriff
asked

   i havent seen it since i left that
man henry answered

  the sheriff had a deputy with him
and they searched the house and then
the barn they found the bag hid in
the barn

  planted there said mcgregor

  oh sure the sheriff tried to make
henry tell where the money was but
never havin laid eyes on it henry
couldnt tell him so he carted henry
off to jail the trial was held and henry
was found guilty and sentenced to die
hes dead now unless the governor
stopped it last night

  well this thing interests me said
mcgregor his eyes averted i dont

think your brother is dead in fact
id make a long guess that he aint i
dont know why i got the feelin-er-
but its strong enough so that i aint
worryin none now what do you
think wed better do think wed bet-
ter go down into the village together
as if we had met up or go down sep-
arately as if we didnt know each
other 

  i wish i had your feelin about my
brother hammersley sighed an
ill let you decide what well do i
aint thinkin none too clear

  i think we better be strangers for
a while mcgregor suggested ill
mosey on down an you come in about
half an hour the telegraph office
will be openin up before long ill be
hangin around there when you come
down stable down there is there
back of the hotel

  mcgregor mounted and rode down
into the village and stabled his horse
as he had ridden up to the hotel he
had seen a small building with the tele-
graph companys sign on it across
from the hotel a dozen or so men
were gathered in front of it

  mcgregor walked across the street
edged through the knot of men and
tried the door

  operator aint here yet a man vol-
unteered wont be here for half an
hour hes eatin his breakfast yuh
couldnt hurry that bird if he was goin
to get news about the end of the
world

  expectin some news are you
mcgregor asked

  news by gosh we are expectin
to learn whether a man is dead or
alive thats news aint it 

  how do you mean mcgregor
asked

  the man started the story all over
again and he was still telling it when
the operator came across the street and
unlocked the door he was chewing
a toothpick and he seemed the least in-


top-notch magazine

terested of all the men in the news he
might get

  as he threw the door open a horse
came galloping down the street and
hammersley flung himself from it as
he drew it to a halt in front of the
office the men fell back from him
eying him in silence

  you got anything yet matt he
asked the operator

  i just got here the operator
answered i aint even cut in yet

  find out if there is anything for
me will you hammersley asked in
a hushed voice

  the operator pulled a plug from a
single hole below a double row of holes
and a sounder on the table began to
clatter hammersley pressed up against
the railing and the other men includ-
ing mcgregor crowded in behind him

 whats it say hammersley
breathed

  why that aint for me the op-
erator answered county seat is
sendin to somebody down the line i
guess sendin sounds like that ham
at the county scat

 how will my message come
hammersley asked

  be relayed at the county seat from
the capital

  oh cant you ask him if he has got
anything

  i cant break in on him the op-
erator snapped keep your shirt on
and i will get in on the wire in a
minute

  he seated himself before the clat-
tering instrument and opened the
switch keeping the key closed with his
forefinger he idly chewed his tooth-
pick as he gazed out of the window

  you must be expectin big news
stranger mcgregor said to ham-
mersley

  big news hammersley assented

  well i would take it easy if i were
you mcgregor advised

  the clattering of the sounder sud-

denly stopped there was an instant
of silence during which mcgregor
could hear the heavy breathing of the
men behind him and then there were
snapped-out morse characters as the
operator who had been receiving gave
his o k and then there was silence
again

  the local operator took his finger
from the key and sounded a call there
was an immediate response the op-
perator manipulated his key and again
held it closed the sounder clattered
the operator manipulated his key
again there was the brief i i of
assent the operator definitely closed
his key he did not turn around

  there aint nothin for you yet
hammersley he said i told the
county seat to ask the capital if they
had anything ill be hearin later on
hammersley turned about and made
his way blindly through the group of
men as they fell away before him

chapter iv

a tense drama

hen hammersley left the office

	mcgregor followed him out into
the street the others came close be-
hind mcgregor across the street men
stepped down from the platforms in
front of the hotel and the store next
to it and came toward the group ham-
mersley and mcgregor were imme-
diately the center of an enlarged group

  those who had come across the
street wanted to know what the news
was and when they were told they
clucked and murmured and commented

  well yuh know a man offered
no news is good news

  there is something in that ham-
mersley mcgregor said if the
worst had happened your lawyer
would have let you know

  hammersley turned his red dazed
eyes on his new friend its the other
way around he returned the
crimson trail



lawyer would have had to see the gov-
ernor last night if he had got a stay
from him he would have filed his mes-
sage in the night if he waited for-
for the other he wouldnt file the mes-
sage till this mornin

  mcgregor opened his lips as if he
were about to speak but then he closed
them again he linked his arm through
hammersleys and led him out of the
crowd keep up your nerve he
said i havent given up by a long
shot i just got a feeling that your
brother is still all right lets get
away from these people

  i got to stay near the telegraph
office hammersley told him

  well go to the hotel

  as they started for the platform
mcgregor saw two horses turn into
the village street they dashed down
the street at a gallop 

  at the increasing sound they made
hammersley turned theres annie
my sister he said and i aint got no
good news for her

  the horses sped up to the hotel and
a man and a girl dismounted the girl
ran up to hammersley he took her
hands and only shook his head

  while brother and sister stood cling-
ing to each other mcgregor looked at
the girl she was taller for a woman
than hammersley was for a man but
there was a suggestion of his bodily
strength in her her hair was very
black and beneath it the oval of her
cheeks was without a suggestion of
color

  as her brother shook his head a
tremor passed through her but she
conquered it and then stood there in
a kind of rigidity which spoke of a
strength of mind as well as of body
she was not mcgregor saw worry-
ing so much for herself as her brother
was worrying for her

  i couldnt wait she told ham-
mersley i just couldnt of course
i didnt sleep last night and the long

night was all i could stand you
mean there is no word jim

  no word he answered

  he glanced at mcgregor and for a
moment mcgregor thought he was
going to forget their agreement and
introduce him as one who had offered
his assistance then he seemed to re-
member and his eyes went to the man
who had accompanied the girl mc-
gregors own eyes followed that
glance

  mcgregor saw a tall sunburned man
with cold hard blue eyes and an im-
passive face there was something
very still about this man his eyes
met hammersleys and they did not
waver and no emotion of any kind
seemed to show in them the eyes
were steadily held the lashes did not
stir the mans hands were at his
sides motionless at the end of long
arms

  the girl watching her brother
seemed to see his gaze go to this mans
face she roused herself out of her
rigid self-control and turning beck-
oned to the man he went up to her
and laid his right hand lightly on her
arm she was either unaware of the
contact or gave it no significance she
permitted the hand to lie there

  mcgregor watching the three nar-
rowly felt his face burn this famil-
iarity on the mans part angered him
the girl was suffering the man was
taking advantage of that and there
was something more as the girl at
once proved

  jim she said i feel that there
is still hope mr harbord is helping
us too

  is he hammersley asked hows

that

  i took it an myself to send a mes-
sage to the governor last night har-
bord told him i got twelve men to
sign it-twelve of the most influential
men i could think of i took the lib-
erty of saying that new evidence had


top-notch magazine

been discovered that is about the
only thing that would lead the governor
to intervene of course there isnt any
new evidence yet but there may be we
shall just have to keep on working
you think theres a chance the gov-
ernor may do somethin hammersley
asked

  i think there is more than a chance
harbord answered i have met the
governor in fact i entertained him
when he was through here campaign-
ing you know the governor is a
cattleman himself and in my telegram
i played on that told him who you
folks were and all about jrou

  i dont know how im ever goin
to thank you hammersley said i
didnt know as we had such good
friends

  the men who signed the telegram
dont believe your brother is guilty
harbord added i dont believe he
is guilty i dont think he was the
kind of man who would kill another
man in cold blood

  the hand which had been resting on
the girls arm slipped down and clasped
her hand briefly she did not seem to
notice it she did not withdraw her
hand but mcgregor was sure there
was no answering pressure the girl
seemed to be oblivious of everything
but her thoughts about the man in the
death cell over at the capital

  harbords action stirred anger in
mcgregor however he strode up to
the trio where they stood apart from
the watching crowd

  mcgregor fixed his eyes on har-
bords face the man was looking at
the girl as he went on further to ex-
press his confidence that his telegram
would result in action by the governor
as he finished however he seemed to
become aware of the steady regard
which mcgregor had fixed upon him
he lifted his head and blue eyes and
gray met

  harbord apparently had an abun-

dance of self-control not only that
but he seemed to be of a cold unemo-
tional nature so that habit and natural
inclination combined to make him
master of himself in emergencies on
the surface there seemed to be no
emergency here a stranger caught up
as he might easily be in this tense
drama had approached to discover
whether the principals in it were about
to do or say anything interesting at
its worst it was only an act of dis-
courtesy and a man might be forgien
for forgetting to be courteous just now

  however as mcgregor had judged
he would be able to do harbord
seemed to probe at once beneath the
surface his first intention mcgregor
believed was to stare him down his
blue eyes as he fixed them on mc-
gregors face were steady cold and
unwinking as they had been all along
he seemed to believe that he could
abash this intruder with his stare

  mcgregor however could be cold
and hard too if the occasion required
there was a stnin of gentleness in
him but this gentleness was rarely
aroused except by those who were
weaker than himself whether it was a
natural weakness or a weakness in-
duced by emotion as in the case of
hammersley with men who stood on
equal footing with him mcgregor was
simply a man in his turn playing the
game as developments made it neces-
sary to play it

  because of harbords attitude to-
ward the girl in her time of distress
he disliked the man intensely that
was another thing characteristic of him
he leaped to likes and dislikes quickly
and he had proved to himself that he
usually leaped to them justly he had
a safe instinct in that

  therefore his eyes were as cold and
hard as harbords own as the two men
faced each other harbords eyes were
the first to change the coldness in
them was replaced by little fiery
crimson trail



gleams showing that ihe could be sud-
denly and swiftly angered mcgregor
guessed that harbord had expected to
stare him down at once and was net-
tled because he had been unable to
do it

  what is it fellow he asked

  that sneering word fellow was as
sandpaper on mcgregors pride har-
bord gave it an insulting inflection
mcgregor had not meant to announce
himself as a friend of hammersleys
but now all his straightforwardness
urged him to step out as just that he
didnt trust this man harbord he
was a little too smooth for one
thing he was interested in the girl
and he was selfish enough to thrust his
interest on her when she was suffer-
ing as she was mcgregor was sure
that she had not noticed the touch of
harbords hand on her arm and then
on her hand but that did not temper
the mans intention

  what is what mcgregor snapped
back

  before harbord could retort the
girl looked around quickly at mc-
gregor he was conscious of her
gaze he tried to fight back the flush
that swept up into his cheeks but he
could not he tried not to look at her
but he failed in that too slowly lie
turned his head and his eyes met hers
whatever emotion might have been
aroused in him by looking into her
deep brown eyes if the circumstances
had been different more conventional
died out of him at once

  there was no terror in this strong
girls eyes not so much as there was
in her brothers from time to time but
there was something which stirred mc-
gregors pity vastly more it was the
abiding steady heartrending sorrow of
a good woman her soul mcgregor
felt had not been seared by this sor-
row but the sorrow had gone down
into her heart and it dwelt there as an
agony of longing and grief

chapter v

the news arrives

i tnder the girls scrutiny mc-
gregor removed his hat he felt
as he would have done if he and she
had been standing in the presence of
her loved dead he was conscious only
of a welling up of kindness and a pro-
found pity for her he was proud to
enlist for her openly to hide him-
self he perceived now to try to work
for her under cover would have been
a kind of cowardice in him he for-
got harbord and his insulting ques-
tionings he forgot hammersley he
had a strange feeling as if he and she
stood alone together ready to confront
whatever there was to confront

  maam he said i am here to help
you in any way i can

  he did not realize that he was a
total stranger to her that she had not
been aware till a moment before that
there was a man like him in the world
he remembered only that he had known
her for half a year that she had dwelt
in his mind and in his heart so long
that she had been there like a sweet
dream of repose and contentment

  he stood looking at her- a little wist-
fully a little boyishly the respect of
a clean young boy shining in eyes no
longer cold or hard something of his
feeling he gladly saw must have com-
municated itself to her a little color
lifted itself into her cheeks and
trembled there tier lips parted slight-
ly but she seemed unable to find the
question she wished to ask that he
supposed might rise from the fact
that any one who could offer help
would be welcome and also from the
fact that she was puzzled as to his
identity

  i am a friend of your brothers
he added simply

  oh she said quickly relieved and
glad he thought and she turned to
hammersley


top-notch magazine

  hammersley seemed to be puzzled
for a moment he had not mcgregor
saw expected mcgregor to disclose
himself at least so soon but he too
appeared to find relief in this open lin-
ing up of an ally

  yes he said too quickly mc-
gregor feared hes a friend of mine
a good friend of mine cattleman
from over the mountains i met him
several times last year hes on a va-
cation an was lookin me up

  the girl turned and put out her
hand a warm hand even now with
strong fingers mcgregor took it but
he could no longer look at her he
had to veil his eyes even so he felt
that harbords eyes were on his face

  my name is mcgregor maam
he said

  i am glad you are here the girl
returned and there was more in that
than mcgregor had hoped for

 harbord now stepped forward
where do you say you are from
he asked a little harshly

  i didnt say mcgregor retorted
his confidence returning ham-
mersley said i was from over the
mountains whatever he says goes
with you doesnt it

  you have a ranch over there have
you 

  i havent

  understood hammersley to say you
were a cattleman

  hes foreman of a ranch over
there hammersley volunteered

  whose ranch there was sus-
picion in harbords voice it rang with
a sort of challenge

  monroe and sullivan outfit mc-
gregor replied easily ever hear of
that outfit

  why yes of course everybody
has heard of it

  there was a little respect in har-
bords voice now the outfit which
mcgregor named was one of the big-
gest in the state if mcgregor were

foreman for that outfit he had a job
that any man would be proud of he
was young too might be superinten-
dent one of these days mcgregor
guessed that something like this was
running in harbords mind for the
man had been thrown off his guard
and his face revealed more than it had
before

  hammersley and his sister had
turned toward the telegraph office
mcgregor followed their gaze the
operator was sitting inside his feet on
the table

  nothing yet the girl breathed

  there will be harbord assured
her dont worry the governor
wont ignore my telegram not with all
those names on it

  if anything results from your tele-
gram we will owe you more than i can
say

  there will be much to do after-
ward and i will do it harbord re-
turned

  mcgregor glancing at hammersley
to discover how he was bearing up un-
der the strain saw the mans eyes leave
the telegraph-office door and wander
over the crowd on each side of it sud-
denly he started and his body went
rigid just as mcgregor withdrew his
eyes from his face hammersley
glanced in his direction and then he
began slowly to move away from his
sisters side mcgregors eyes were
down but he could still see the slow
withdrawal of the lower part of ham-
mersleys body at last he saw hani
mersley turn fully around

  mcgregor looked up the girl was
talking to harbord and was not aware
of her brothers action mcgregor
stepped around behind her and fol-
lowed hammersley as hammersley
neared the group at one side of the
door his hand went into his coat
pocket two men who mcgregor
saw had become aware of ham-
mersleys approach detached them-
crimson trail

 

selves from the crowd and stepped to-
ward the corner of the building

  theres two of them that swore my
brothers life away hammersley sud-
denly screamed

  he whipped a thirty-two caliber gun
from his pocket it occurred to mc-
gregor that he must have bought it
with this intention in his mind for it
was not such a gun as he would carry
when he carried one at all

  hammersleys hand came up the
two men started to run hammersley
called out to them to halt and they
came to a stop and fell back against
the building their hands in the air

  mcgregor had been only a few feet
behind hammersley when hammersley
had drawn the gun he covered the
space in one long easy leap and caught
hammersleys arm and brought it
down hammersley struggled vio-
lently exerting the strength which mc-
gregor had known all along was in his
stocky body but mcgregor had a
greater strength he pinioned ham-
mersleys arm and wrenched the
weapon from his hand stepping back
then

  hammersley confronted him with
tears of rage in his eyes why didnt
you lemme do it he cried they
got it cornin to them

  there was a swift step behind mc-
gregor and the girl ran up to her
brother and took hold of him and held
him against her at length he straight-
ened up and passed his hand across his
tyes

  i forgot myself he said

  mcgregor knew that he was merely
seeking to throw them off their guard
he had doubtless planned this thing
deliberately and he was the bulldog
kind of man who does not give way
mcgregor was aware that he had an-
other task in addition to helping the
man and his sister he would have to
guard him against himself the lust
for revenge was in him though mc-

gregor did not blame him for it he
had undoubtedly lived a calm and con-
tented life and now he dwelt with the
specter of tragedy at his elbow

  mcgregor walked past the two and
tip to the men whom hammersley had
menaced

  you boys seem to kind of stir ham-
mersley up he said quietly he
aint himself he aint exactly re-
sponsible if i was you i would move
on to where he cant see you

  the danger past the courage of the
two men seemed to be returning re-
sentment showed in their faces

  you aint runnin the town are
you one of them asked

  no boys but you might as well
sift along mcgregor replied

  they eyed him and he them he
had spoken quietly enough but there
was a resolute look on his face his
eyes were steadily on their faces at
last one shifted on his feet the other
shrugged his shoulders

  mebbe well be seem you again
fella the first said but they moved
away

  mcgregor said nothing he knew
that he had made two more enemies
but that did not matter he did not
regret his having stepped out into the
open he had a sense of freedom

  now as he started back toward
hammersley there was a stir at the
telegraph-office door the group on
each side pressed up to it there were
murmurs then cries

  hammersley hammersley tele-
gram for yuh hammersley where
is hammersley

  they seemed to have forgotten that
he was only a little distance from them
he left his sister and ran to the door
they let him pass and he darted into
the office the crowd pressed up one
glance showed mcgregor that the girl
was clinging to harbord trembling in
excitement and dread

  hammersleys head appeared above


top-notch magazine

the heads of the others about the door
they yelled to him to tell them the
news he shouted back to them to let
him pass and when they found he
would tell them nothing they made a
lane for him

  hammersley did not at once come
down that lane he flung up both
arms and grasped the door jambs with
his hands mcgregor saw that one
hand clutched a sheet of yellow paper

  annie annie hammersley called
his thought all for her its a stay a
stay its a stay of execution for
thirty days henry is still alive

chapter vi

in a tight place

at once mcgregor turned to look at
the girl she was still clinging to
harbord but as her brother finished
she slowly stood erect it was only by
a great effort that she succeeded mc-
gregor perceived she was getting her
breath with difficulty through parted
lips asif her heart were pounding

  she suddenly pressed one hand
above her heart and then she freed her-
self from harbord entirely she
smiled the iwavest smile mcgregor
had ever seen it struck at his own
heart

  you good girl he said very
softly

  hammersley now came down through
the lane of men and ran up to his
sister as he came he smoothed out
the telegram and handed it to her when
he reached her she read it with
swiftly traveling eyes

  well she said we have thirty
days for work

  you betcha hammersley agreed
and we will do somethin in them
thirty days i got a feelin now that
everything is goin to be all right the
governor wouldnt have done this much
if he hadnt thought there was a big
chance that henry wasnt guilty

  the governorll probably be doing
some work on his own hook mc-
gregor said you know i told you
hammersley that he was on the level
friend of the governors are you
harbord asked with a sneer

  oh no mcgregor answered but
he has got the reputation of being on
the level you know that if you ever
read the newspapers

  the eyes of the two men met again
and there was even a more definite hos-
tility than before in those eyes har-
bord did not continue his stare how-
ever he turned to hammersley

  may i ask who the telegram is
from he queried

  why its from sobey our lawyer
hammersley answered

  mcgregor watching the man saw a
shadow of anger pass across his face

  there was no telegram for me
harbord asked

  i didnt stop to find out ham-
mersley replied i was too excited
i reckon

  ill find out harbord said more
savagely than the situation seemed to
warrant he turned and strode toward
the telegraph office

  annie looked after him hes act-
ing queerly she said i wonder
whats the matter with him

  why he expected the governor
would wire him mcgregor told her
he wanted the credit for getting the
stay

  oh i see she said softly

  well we better be gettin on home
said hammersley he looked at mc-
gregor youre still of a mind to
help us he added i shouldnt ask
you i suppose but im grabbin at
everything that comes my way we
got only thirty days and they aint
goin to be any too long i got you
sized up mcgregor and im wallin to
trust you

  before mcgregor could answer he
saw harbord emerge from the tele-
crimson trail



graph office and come toward them
the shadow which had passed across
his face had returned and remained
and as he looked at mcgregor it deep-
ened to a black cloud

  he strode up to the trio you rid-
in home hammersley he asked

  were startin now hammersley
answered

  im going too harbord said he
hesitated and then he turned to mc-
gregor i suppose youre riding out
that way too are you

  not just at present mcgregor re-
plied smoothly think ill hang
around town for a while

  harbord had asked him a question
about his business and he felt that he
had a right to ask harbord one also
he was human enough to indulge a
light malice toward this fellow who
thought so well of himself did you
get a telegram from the governor he
inquired

  thats my business harbord
snapped

  annies glance flitted to mcgregors
face his lips curved just perceptibly
in the relief that had come to her she
could meet his suggestion of a smile
with a like suggestion then she looked
at harbord

  id like to know whether you got
a telegram mr harbord she said
if the governor answered you we
would have that much more right to
hope it would show that he is ready
to assure any one that he is interested
in the case

  i didnt get a telegram harbord
answered i will get one though
he added with a show of confidence

  oh yes annie said wed bet-
ter start for home now jim

  all right hammersley said
youre cornin harbord

  ill wait and see if i get a tele-
gram harbord replied and in spite
of himself it seemed to mcgregor his
eyes went to mcgregors face

  youll be out this afternoon mc-
gregor hammersley asked

  or to-night mcgregor answered

 annie looked at mcgregor and
nodded a little gravely and then she
and her brother went down the street
to get their horses in a few minutes
mcgregor saw them ride out of town

  without a word to harbord he
turned and started toward the hotel
he knew that harbord had lingered
more to see what he vas going to do
than to wait for a possible telegram
and he was willing to let harbord
make whatever move was to be made
or to say whatever there was to be
said

  harbord seemed to be ready from
his tone when he spoke mcgregor
saw that he was thoroughly angry now

  just a minute fellow

  mcgregor wheeled and walked back
to him and confronted him closely he
was angered but he fought back the
anger he did not want to show it to
harbord indeed he did not want to
feel it he knew that an angry man
thinks less clearly than a calm one
also anger was an unusual emotion
with him he had always been glad
of that because he had observed that
anger was a devastating thing in other
men it bred mental ill health he
always liked to be cool quiet eminently
sane

  theres no necessity that i can see
for you callin me fellow mr har-
bord he said

  he permitted himself a little smile
as he spoke harbord seemed to think
that the smile was an indication of an
intention to placate him mcgregor
guessed that harbord believed he had
put up a front in the presence of
annie and hammersley and was now
inclined to be peaceful since they were
gone	

  harbord proved that he was a bully
whether naturally or whether tempo-
rarily because he had not made the


top-notch magazine

showing he had expected to make mc-
gregor did not know

  ill do something more than fel-
low you he declared ill give you
a straight tip let me tell you those
hammersleys are in trouble theyre
not capable of exercising good judg-
ment thats why they picked up with
you they would grab at any help
just now but what help have you got
to offer id like to know cow-
puncher on a vacation i suppose you
think you will step in and unravel this
thing and make a hit with miss ham-
mersley fat chance if henry ham-
mersley is set free finally it will be be-
cause somebody does some head work
we dont want you butting in in fact
this town isnt big enough for you

  why said mcgregor the town
dont need to be big enough for tne im
not stayin in it you heard me tell
them folks i would be out to their place
to-night lots of room out there aint
there 

  lots of it but still not enough for
you

  harbord glared at him and mc-
gregor only smiled what little anger
he had felt had died in mcgregor this
was only a bluff and a man would be
a fool to let himself be stirred up by a
bluff

  im goin out there to-night mc-
gregor stated

  youre liable to run into something

  well what

  you look here harbord said his
anger apparently growing in the face of
the others coolness i know why you
have butted in on this thing youre
attracted to miss hammersley you
think you can make up to her you
cant i wont stand for it she-i am
going to marry her myself his anger
mcgregor saw was carrying him out
of himself i aim to protect her from
any damned cow-puncher that comes
drifting along if you were decent i
wouldnt care i would be willing to

let you make your play knowing it
would do you no good but ive seen
your kind before i know your game

  mcgregor was the  simple-hearted
kind of man who can place a woman on
a pedestal and give her a clean un-
wavering devotion mcgregor had
done that with annie hammersley he
had dreamed his dreams about her-
golden beautiful dreams he felt now
that harbord had not only accused him-
self but in some way had accused
annie the slow-gathering strong
anger of his type came to him

  if he had waited thirty seconds he
doubtless would not have done what he
did but he did not wait thirty sec-
onds he did not wait two the first
instant gave him sufficient time to send
his right fist curving over harbords
shoulder harbord received the blow
full on the side of the jaw he wav-
ered very briefly went to his knees and
then fell to the ground

  mcgregor stepped back out of the
corner of his eye he saw that the men
who had still remained about the tele-
graph-office door were now running to-
ward him he retreated still farther
from harbord he had a notion that
he was in a tight place the minds of
these men had been dwelling for some
time on a violent act an act which had
placed the life of hammersley in jeo-
pardy he knew how thoughts of vio-
lence breed further thoughts of violence

  he was a stranger here these men
might vigorously resent his attacking
one who was well known to them they
would not be aware what his reason for
striking harbord had been and per-
haps unfortunately for himself he could
not give them the reason he would
not use annie hammersleys name in
an effort to justify himself if he could
he would strike harbord down again
if harbord attempted to use that name

  he confronted the men as they
stopped the body of harbord lying be-
tween him and them at first the men
crimson trail



regarded harbord in silence then
their eyes went to mcgregor they
studied him still in silence from hat to
toe what it was in himself that struck
them favorably mcgregor did not know
but suddenly one man laughed grins
came to the faces of the others mc-
gregor knew then that he was in no
danger from them

  as he looked at harbord again the
man stirred and lifted himself to an
elbow it was a minute before the dazed
look went out of his eyes and the blank-
ness out of his face in another min-
ute he sat up and then got to his feet
his face was twisted with passion

  mcgregor understood then what he
had guessed all along that pride was a
ruling emotion with harbord to be
struck down in the presence of so many
witnesses would be such a blow to that
pride as he doubtless had rarely suf-
fered before swift on his sense of in-
jury mcgregor was sure would come
a desire for revenge

   the succeeding chapters of this novel will
appear in the next issue o top-notch
dated and out june th

a mere detail

  although the lovers had known
each other only three days they had to
part

  come along please cried the rail-
road guard and the young couple lin-
gering on the edge of the platform
started

  itll be terrible without you the
young man observed

  and ill miss you too said she
i never was so happy and all because
we met three days ago

  but think how dreadful its going to
be he wailed

  stand away there yelled the
guard

  youll write she called from the
window

  every day he answered

  then suddenly he tore after the train
and as he almost overbalanced on the
extreme end of the platform he made a
trumpet of his hands and cried dar-
ling darling what on earth did yon
say your name was

oh well

  bridget the maid approached her
mistress can i take the week off
mum im goin to be married

  her mistress gave her the week off
and at the end of the week bridget re-
turned

  oh mum she said i have been
having a splendid time i was a lovely
bride the dress was so nice and the
cake a wonder

  well bridget this sounds delight-
ful said her mistress i hope you
have got a good husband

  bridgets tone changed to one of in-
dignation would you believe it
mum she answered but the wicked
man never turned up

the bold offer

  he was rather inclined to blow his
own trumpet was the young clerk and
the boarders in the house had stood
about as much as they could

  suddenly one braver than the rest
said look here young man i think
weve all heard what you can do now
would you mind telling us something
you cant do and ill undertake to do
it myself

  well replied the talkative one with-
out the slightest hesitation youre a
sport i cant pay my bill for a start
and i accept your offer

worth it

  sweet young thing claude says
he worships the very ground i stand
on

one good surprise

i ife is full of surprises good and
bad and a pleasant surprise is just
as delightful an experience as an un-
pleasant one is the reverse we all know

brings us happiness such things were
common to us as children and as we
grow older we still like to be surprised
the unexpected happening continues to
give us a thrill

 one of our new friends got a sur-
prise recently here is his letter

ber of your top-notch magazine and more

ing stories that may be read by young and

able surprise when he read top-notch

think what a number of pleasant sur-
prises are in store for those who have

of this will make a note to give some
of their friends a real surprise by in-
troducing this magazine to them an
acquaintance thus formed will grow
steadily into an enduring friendship

faith in the quality of the fiction we
are publishing and we know that the
variety we offer makes an appeal to a

troduction is necessary to gain us a host
of new friends

  nearly everybody reads something
and after all as one of our friends re-
marked recently good reading is the
cheapest and best form of entertain-
ment the cost is trivial the pleasure
is great and as our readers are aware

guaranteed not to bore you if you

after six months trial

editor of top-notch magazine

  dear editor through the insistence of
mr barger some six months ago i secured
my first copy of top-notch and i am cer-
tainly well pleased with it and feel as though
i would like to take this opportunity to express
my appreciation i have never missed a copy
since then the stories are of such a concise
rnture rapid moving and of intense action that
ones enthusiasm is continually at its highest
from the beginning of each story to the end

  your stories of baseball are certainly ap-
preciated and if an occasional tennis story
could be run in it would be complete no
doubt from this you will learn that i am an
ardent tennis fan your story that thou-
sand-dollar flyer by moore and edholm
was especially enjoyed as well as the shorter
story phantom gold by rocmer i like
your sport stories better than mystery and
detective stories however i realize that all
must be combined to make a magazine the
top-notch

  let me take this opportunity to extend my
best wishes for the continued success of a
great magazine-top-notch

  believe me	sincerely yours

more to praise than censure

editor of top-notch magazine

  dear sir for several years i have been
reading top-notch and as a rule am very
well pleased with it there is no issue that
i have been unable to find pleasure in though
there is rarely one in which i enjoy every-
thing however i find more to praise than
censure so let it go at that

  you have only one regular contributor whom


top-notch magazine

i do not read at all of late ray sense of
humor not being capable of seeing the com-
edy of his efforts i refer to thomas thurs-
day however he pleases most of your read-
ers and there is plenty of other matter for
me so that lets me out of that i suppose
my sense of humor is to blame

i am always glad to get the new copy of
top-notch i am not permanently located
so must depend upon news stands they
seldom fail to provide though i am sometimes
too late let top-notch continue and may
it outlive us all

thanking you for your time i am

     yours for good reading

                         with skirts so short
                      the younger set are now
                      wearing stockings over
                      the knee instead of rolled
                      and still uncorsetted
                      have joyously welcomed
                      the girdlon to hold their
                      stockings trimly taut

                     the girdlon is of
                  dainty webbing or shirred
                  ribbon and is a perfectly
                  comfortable garter belt
                  there is no pinching at
                  the waist because it is
                  worn around the hips where it is scarcely felt-
                  and it cannot possibly slip down
