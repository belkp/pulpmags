 gawky for guard

by nelson s bond

they built dan carter from a clumsy hayseed into the flashiest hottest

     hoopster in the central conference
     wonder-then played him for

the crimson-clad invaders from little
crawford college fell into a watch-
ful five-three defense as the midland
squad having just been scored on put the
ball into play warily the forward trio of
midland moved over the center-line snap-
ping the sphere back and forth with deft
precision

  slip wilkinson midlands left forward
was the first to enter the defense zone as
a keen-eyed crawford man moved in on
him slip dribbled the ball three swift

  presto-ed him into a fair-hai
the prize sucker of all time

paces cut from the zone and passed to
midlands towering center empy bower
bowers high looper from mid-court hov-
ered precariously for a second on the rim
of the hoop-then toppled back into the
hands of a defending guard

  the crawford college quintet triangu-
lating the ball with a skill born of despera-
tion swept the play up from their own
territory to the midland side of the hard-
wood their forward flash ab wooster
took a pass from center bounced the sphere


basketball stories

around his confused guard charged into
the scoring area-and shot the cords
scarcely rippled as the leather whisked
through

  on the midland bench old pop brighton
sighed and shook his head dolefully that
shot made the score --nd now mid-
land held only a slim two-basket lead over
the red invaders with just a few minutes
remaining in this final period and this
was supposed to be a warm-up game for
the green

  pop scanned his reserves thoughtfully
designated one eager youngster with a nod
the ref held his starting whistle as the
new player charged out onto the court and
the scorekeeper marked the substitution
brannigan at guard for oday

again midland put the ball in play-
and this time it was empy bower
who opened the scoring path for the home
team running a solo to the center line
where he stopped wheeled and shot a
lightning pass to jack hapes hapes took
the ball up the sideline then pivoted des-
perately as the tight zone defense blotted
his view of the basket he shot the ball
back to the pivot man

  bower spun swiftly and shot a looper to
the new midland guard bus brannigans
over-anxious fingers just scraped the
leather as it bobbled weakly over the side-
line a groan rose from the midland
stands as the referees whistle shrilled

  outside crawford

  wooster cuddled the ball feinted then
shot it to his running mate stewart
stewart leaped high in the air and bounced
a bulls-eye off the backboard the strings
hissed as the ball jerked through mid-
land  crawford 

  pop brighton peered anxiously at his
watch breathed a sigh of relief as he saw
that only seconds remained in the game
then his heart leaped to his mouth as he
saw that midland instead of freezing the
ball was making one last desperate drive
downcourt to increase their marginal lead

  already the ball was past midcourt and
slip wilkinson momentarily free of his
guard was pointing for a score try tense
expectancy hovered over the watchers as
the forward poised shot

  for a long lazy moment the ball hung
in the air like a thing motionless then

as if spent with its efforts it dropped
cleanly through the crawford hoop just as
the final whistle brought the game to a close
midland had won-but in the eyes of the
midland rooters there was doubt and des-
pair if the green could just barely beat
out this little quintet  to -what would
happen when the real competition came
along 

pop brighton dismissed his squad
to the showers then turned and trudged
slowly toward the gymnasium door he
hadnt the heart to face his boys tonight
he knew only too well that he would see
mirrored in their eyes something of the
chagrin that he was feeling his shoul-
ders sagged dejectedly

  well pop

   he raised his head and tried to force a
smile to his lips as a slim arm looped itself
through his he turned to look into the
worried face of betty carruthers daugh-
ter of his oldest friend now a co-ed at
midland

  well betty we won

  oh pop there was pity and regret
in the girls soft voice both knew what
the other was thinking-that it was use-
less to smile and pretend that tonights
victory was an impressive one whats
the matter with the team  why didnt they
make a better showing against the craw-
ford outfit

  the lighted windows of the gymnasium
had fallen behind now and they were walk-
ing down the tree-lined pathway that
wound past the tennis courts and the prac-
tice gridiron up to the ivy-covered walls
of old main beneath the gloom of an
ancient elm they sat down on a bench

   ill tell you betty said the veteran
coach heavily its the guard post that
worries me most you must have noticed
that i made more substitutions there to-
night than anywhere else-but none of
them seemed to do any good wilkinson
and hapes are fine forwards empy
bower is the classiest center in the confer-
ence hal gordon is-well you know
what a fine all-around athlete hal is he
plays his guard position as well as could
be desired but the fifth man-

   brighton shook his head glumly

  you cant make a basketball team out
of four good men and one bad one the
gawky

opposing team will spot the weak link too
quickly and plan all their plays through his
position brannigan and oday are the
best we have and you saw what happened
to them tonight neither of them are cap-
able of staving off a determined scorer
and neither of them can provide the scor-
ing threat that should always be latent in
a guard

then theres only one thing for us to
do said the girl determinedly we must
find such a guard surely in a college the
size of midland there must be someone
pop shook his head

  miracles dont happen betty and
anyway if there is such a man hed better
come along now 

  yes or else what

  it will be too late for me shrugged
the coach the wolves are howling for
my scalp the alumni and the athletic
council are complaining because i havent
given midland a championship team or
even a contender for the past six years
and if something doesnt turn up this
year-

  but pop they cant do that to you
why youve been basketball coach here
for almost twenty years

  yes betty for almost twenty years
but ill be among the discards next year
unless i can come up with a new guard a
guard with a quick eye sure hands a
smooth stride on the floor

  pop rose from the bench

  well youngster time you were getting
along home ill see you to the sorority
house

  oh no pop the girl protested swiftly
its not ar from here ill be all right
ill see you later

  with a gay wave she turned and moved
swiftly down the shadowed path by old
main the coach watched her disappear
around the corner of the college building
then plodded silently toward his own little
home on the edge of the campus

a lanky ungainly shadow loomed
before betty carruthers as she swung
around the corner of old main causing
her to step back with a quick startled cry
a voice from the darkness spoke reassur-
ingly

sorry miss guess i wasnt looking
where i was going oh miss carruthers

for guard	

  she recognized the voice it was that
country boy dan carter the one hal
gordon and the rest of her friends had
nicknamed gawky there was a faint
amusement in her tone as she answered
him

  it was stupid of me to be frightened
but we met so unexpectedly

  could i-i mean would it be all right
if i saw you home miss carruthers
asked the boy eagerly

  betty hesitated she had wanted to be
alone if this awkward lout insisted on
talking to her she knew she would go mad
still it was late and she had quite some
way to go

  why yes she agreed reluctantly it
would be very nice of you

  she remembered now the first time she
had seen him it had been during the final
days of the football season she had been
watching the football practice a lonely fig-
ure in the stands and gawky carter had
been playing end for the scrub team a
very poor end at that the regular squad
had seemed to be able to score through his
position almost at will-mainly because the
lanky boy was so unbelievably awkward
he stumbled and fell she remembered all
over the field when his clumsiness was
not removing him from a play it seemed
to interfere with one of his teammates

  late in the practice session with the
scrubs in possession of the ball he had
managed somehow or other to receive an
almost impossible forward pass from the
scrub quarterback a play that had aston-
ished even his teammates for the ball had
seemed to be far out of reach of any eligi-
ble receiver-but he had immediately pro-
ceeded to nullify his one spectacular play
by driving headlong into a stone-wall de-
fense that dropped him for a loss

only once since then had betty even
so much as glimpsed the gawky one
somewhat to her own surprise she had
seen him at a student mix in the student
union building he had as a matter of
fact danced with her once and now she
recalled briefly her own mild astonishment
that the lanky chap whose awkwardness
had been so apparent on the football field
was not at all a bad dancer on the smooth
polished boards of the dancing floor his
clumsy length seemed to get new poise
basketball stories

his awkwardness slipping away from him
amazingly and he moved to the music in
perfect rhythm and timing

  she stole a glance at him as he strode
along beside her silent in the frosty moon-
light he wasnt a bad looking boy not
handsome at all of course perhaps even
on the homely side but a pleasant frank
kind of homeliness for a moment she felt
a pang of pity after all he was just a
kid from the sticks it was too bad he was
so loutish on the gridiron all he had was
a pair of sure hands

  a gasp of shocked wonderment nearly
passed her lips as suddenly there rung
in her mind the memory of pop brightons
words

     a guard with a quick eye sure
hands a smooth stride on the floor   

  could this boy could this clumsy fellow
they all called gawky- he had caught
forwards and he was a smooth dancer

  betty turned to her silent partner sud-
denly

  mr carter dont you play basket-
ball

  the boy laughed a trifle grimly

  who me im afraid i dont do any-
thing very well

  but you have played havent you

  oh ive played back home when i
was in high school but for that matter i
played football there too when i came
up to midland-

  he shrugged

  why dont you go out for the basket-
ball team asked betty they need men
and if you used to play in high school you
ought to be pretty good

  in the moonlight she could see the tighter
lines that suddenly developed in his lean
cheeks his voice when he spoke was
taut

  my athletic days are over at midland
miss carruthers you might lick a puppy
once and not teach him a lesson but after
three beatings- he laughed harshly i
went out for baseball when i was a fresh-
man here the boys laughed me out of
my uniform then i went out for track
in the last half that same year i won my-
self a nickname that you probably know
gawky even then i hadnt learned my
lesson in september i went out for foot-
ball i ended up on the fourth squad
the only reason i wasnt any farther

down the list was that there were only four
squads no thanks from that time on
ive confined myself to my studies no
more athletics for me

  betty stared at him the more she
thought of it the more she felt that here
was the man whom pop had been looking
for womans intuition perhaps told her
that her guess was right

they had reached the wide porch of
her sorority house the hour was
late but betty knew suddenly desperately
that she would have to do something to
change gawkys mind about going out for
the team

  well goodnight miss carruthers the
boy was saying hesitantly i hope well
meet again sometime

  suddenly the path was clear before her
and betty knew that it lay within her power
to bring this boy out for a basketball trial
there was something in the catch of his
voice the look of his eyes fastened hun-
grily upon her that told the girl she might
save midlands championship chances-
and pops job

  wasnt it worth a try  her hunch might
be wrong gawky might prove to be just
as awkward and useless on the court as on
the track the diamond the gridiron if
he were she had nothing to lose impul-
sively the girl placed one smooth warm
hand in the lads larger one

  goodnight mr carter she said
warmly its been nice hasnt it but
im sorry i wont be seeing you again for
a while you see im very fond of basket-
ball pop brighton practically raised me
you know i go to watch the practice al-
most every day i havent much time for
anything else

  she turned deliberately and started to
run up the steps to the doorway

  wait a minute miss carruthers in
a single bound the tall young man was be-
side her his eyes searching hers you
mean youre very interested in basket-
ball

  oh very

  then if i-i mean youll have to come
home after practice sessions couldnt i
bring you home sometimes

  betty permitted herself a studious frown
  im afraid it wouldnt look quite right

i	mean for you to meet me at the gym con-
gawky for guard



stantly and with no apparent reason

  but if i had a reason for being at the
gym persisted the youth eagerly if i
went out for the basketball team for in-
stance-

  the girl allowed herself to sway provoc-
atively toward the boy for an instant

  if you were out for the team she
laughed softly that would certainly
make a difference-wouldnt it

  then she was gone and on the steps
of the tri-gam house a lanky youngster
stood watching the closed door for a long
breathless moment before he turned and
crunched down the gravel path his shoul-
ders squared with a new determination

ii

dan carter striding past the time-
honored old buildings of midland
college on the way to his little rooming-
house felt the tug of a dozen conflicting
emotions battling within him

  for the first time he told himself over
and over someone in midland college had
noticed him up to now his contacts with
other students had been limited to a nod-
ding acquaintance with a few classmates
a professor or two knew him by sight and
some of his scrub teammates had a gruff
greeting for him as he passed by but of
real friends he had none and more than
anything else in the world gawky carter
wanted friends

  but now he though with sudden exal-
tation all that was ended there was
someone at least who had taken an inter-
est in him and that someone was more
important by far than all the other thou-
sands of students on midland campus
ever since that long past night when dan
carter had summoned all his courage and
asked betty carruthers for a dance at the
student mix he had worshiped her si-
lently to him she epitomized all that
which combined made for perfect wo-
manhood charm delicacy and loveliness

  and incredibly enough she seemed to
like him hadnt that shown plainly in
every word she spoke in the way she
looked at him	 

pop brighton whistled the milling
players to a halt all right boys
thats enough warm-up well try fifteen

minutes of team practice now north
court wilkinson hapes bower gordon
oday south court blane white roch-
ester brannigan carter make it snappy
fellows lets go

  swiftly the two practice squads took their
positions poised in the guard position
dan carter wiped his moist palms ner-
vously on his trunks across from him
jack hapes grinned consolingly

  dont worry gawky well go easy
on you

  dan bit his lip it hadnt taken long for
the court squad to adopt his football nick-
name that was hal gordons doing of
course gordon against whom he had
played when the three-letter man was on
the varsity eleven

  he smiled mirthlessly and riveted his
attention on the play as pop tossed the
ball up and the two fives swung into action
bower coasting allowed rochester to
steal the tap the ball bounced forward to
sam white who whipped it cross-court to
his running mate will blane blane
boxed lost the ball to gordon who raced
it down court into the scrubs territory

  bower coming in fast took the ball on
a short pass from gordon found himself
unable to get set for a try and whipped
the leather to hapes hapes came in after
it leisurely started to set himself before
he even had the ball

  then suddenly he was a lonely figure in
the subs court gawky carter the new
guard candidate had whipped around from
behind him stretched out one of those gan-
gling arms and intercepted the pass cleanly
already he was down to mid-court and
his perfect toss was dropping neatly into
the ready hands of rochester the scrub
center wheeled swiftly and threw the
ball flicked cleanly through the hoop

  as the teams sought their positions hal
gordon addressed the first-squad roughly

  swell stuff letting that long cold
drink of water swipe a pass from you
come on gang show em how

  the regulars put the ball into play zig-
zagging it down the court accurately as the
reserves went into the customary three-
two defense wilkinson first man to en-
ter the scoring zone found himself covered
by blane and tossed backward to the hard-
charging bower bowers return was un-
expected and brannigan was caught out of


basketball stories

position as hapes crossed the court to slip
a two-pointer in from the left guards zone
gordon grinned as his teammates with-
drew beaming

  thats the stuff now well shove one
through gawkys position just to show him
whos who around here

tarting the play for the first time
the reserves took a few seconds time
out to prepare a hasty plan of offense dan
carter all his timidity wiped away now
that he was once more back on the familiar
battlefield of the hardwood boards spoke
succinctly to his nodding teammates as
pop blew his whistle reach rochester put
the ball in play for the scrubs

  the reserves charged down in what ap-
peared to be an orthodox attack roch-
ester fired the ball back to gawky carter
from midcourt position then continued to
race on down to the far corner of the
regulars court under the net a brace of
regular defenders blotted him out of the
play split to cover two men as will blane
entered the threatening area

  like a flash carter tossed a reach-high
blazer to the hands of rochester who made
a half turn and shot the ball back to carter
the running guard took the ball at mid-
court no one was within eight feet of
him as he crouched and laid the leather
through the strings

  on the sidelines pop brightons mouth
dropped open he had just seen some-
thing that he had had in the back of his
mind for two seasons-a play that he had
always felt would work with the right man
but that he had never dared even intro-
duce to his boys he started to speak then
changed his mind perhaps it was a fluke
slire it must have been this lanky fel-
low carter had only been out to practice
for two days

  a murmur from the scrubs seated be-
side him on the sideline bench drew the
coachs attention back to the court he
was just in time to see gawky carter reach
high into the air steal a lofty pass out of
the luckless grip of jack hapes and whip
the ball downcourt to sam white sleeping
under the regulars basket and as white
slipped the ball easily over the rim for the
the first time in many months a new gleam
lighted pop brightons faded eyes luck
be damned the kid was good midland

had found the fifth man for its team

  he blew his whistle

  try a little change here men you
carter play right guard for the regu-
lars oday switch with carter

the change was made and now the re-
organized first-team squad put the ball
into pla again pop brighton sat back on
the bench slowly nodding his head in ap-
proval as the new quintet seemed suddenly
to find its scoring punch in rapid suc-
cession the regulars tallied one    two
   three baskets against the second team
aggregation backed by two dependable
defense men wilkinson and hapes seemed
to find the basket while bower became a
stalwart at pivot gordon and carter al-
ternated at breaking up reserve threats
and either man showed an aptitude for
breaking loose on a running guard play that
led to a direct toss or a pass for a score

  point by point the score mounted for
the regular quintet while a floundering
reserve squad battled vainly to quell the
five-man uprising that confronted them
and finally a new confidence in his voice
pop stopped the uneven slaughter and dis-
missed his charges to the showers

  as they left the gym he turned to the
quiet figure seated in the stands beyond the
court

  weve found him betty he gloated
weve found the fifth man that we
needed theres a chance for midland
yet

a half hour later hal gordon came
up from the dressing-room to find
betty carruthers still waiting in the empty
gymnasium pop had gone back to his
office somehow before the honest warmth
of brightons enthusiasm betty could not
find it within herself to tell him of the
subterfuge which had brought gawky car-
ter to the midland squad she knew
instinctively that the coach would not ap-
prove and she was beginning to feel her-
self that there had been something a little
mean and underhanded in her method of
luring the country boy still a bargain was
a bargain and betty was grimly deter-
mined to carry out her part especially since
gawky had shown up so well in his first
real trial

  well fancy meeting you here the
gawky

smooth gordon grinned taking bettys
arm getting late sweetcakes wed
better be getting along home to dinner
dont hal begged the girl nervously
slipping her arm from his grasp im
waiting here for someone

 who  pop  aw forget it he
wont mind

  no honestly hal

  she stopped suddenly as dan carter his
lean face glowing bounded up from the
dressing-room to pause hesitantly as he
saw the pair before them gordon scowled
as he noted the swift change pass over the
girls face and saw her smile at carter

  so thats the way it is eh he gritted
in a low tone gone overboard for that
gawky galoot have you a fine mess this
is

  not now hal please the girls
whisper was frantic oh hello dan
how does it feel to be back in a uniform
again 

  never mind that began hal gordon
hotly

 hal betty turned swiftly and
slipped her arm through that of the sur-
prised carter dan will you take me
home please now

  carter nodded his eyes following the
red-faced gordon as the other guard
wheeled and strode away it was not un-
til they had almost readied the sorority
house that he dared ask the question that
was on his mind

  whats wrong with gordon he was
angry about something wasnt he

  betty hesitated for an instant she was
tempted to confess that gordons anger
was not groundless for the past year
she and the fraternity man had been con-
stant companions at most campus events
only a recluse like dan carter would not
be aware of that but to tell carter that
would be to let him know that her interest
in him had been purely a fraud from the
beginning

  perhaps i shouldnt tell you dan she
said then deciding that she might as
well go all the way as be half a pretender
-but hal is jealous of you

  of me there was modesty in the
gawky ones tone and amusement too but
beneath both of these was something else

  but we dont have to pay any attention
to him do we smiled the girl lifting her

for guard	

face to his lets talk about you instead
-and about the practice today dan you
were marvelous

gordon was waiting at the edge of
the campus when dan carter finally
left betty on the steps of the tri-gamma
house the jut of the campus heros jaw
left no doubt as to his attitude

  listen here gawky he began bellig-
erently you and i have a little talking to
do about betty

  calmly dan shook himself free of the
others irate grasp his voice was cold
and passionless

  dont be a fool gordon i dont in-
tend to discuss miss carruthers with you
or anyone else

  oh you dont eh sneered gordon
well listen to this my lumbering team-
mate-betty carruthers is my girl has
been for the past year now stay away
from her if you know whats good for
you

  when said dan softly and if miss
carruthers asks me to stay away from her
ill do it not before then and not on
your say-so hal

  why you bag of bones raged gor-
don he took a swift step forward
changed his mind and stepped back again
a curious glint in his eye all right
gawky youve had your warning take
my advice or youll find yourself the laugh-
ing stock of the whole campus there are
ways to take care of hicks who get too
smart

ill

the midland college palestra rocked
with the thunder of applause as slip
wilkinson ducked around his defense man
took a perfect placement from dan carter
and slipped it through the enemy hoop
delighted followers of the green listened
eagerly as the scorekeeper intoned mid-
land  tech 

  of all those crammed into the bril-
liantly lighted gymnasium only two men
knew that all was not well with the mid-
land squad one other pop brighton
might have guessed there was a faint
uneasiness etched in the lines of his face
as he watched his stellar quintet fall into
their positions carter was missing tries
	basketball stories

that the coach felt sure should have been
made and the exchange of passes between
the backcourt men had more than once
resulted in outsides which had been costly

  he concentrated on the jibing faction of
his basketball machine as tech put the ball
into play legs monahan techs fighting
center led the way down the alley bounc-
ing the ball smoothly before him flash
ormond the blueclad left forward moved
into midland territory to be immediately
covered by the alert jack hapes wilkin-
son covered the other forward stewart
the tech offensive stalled briefly legs
marking time for an opening by triangu-
lating between his two advancing guards
ferraro and sproule with everything to
gain and nothing to lose tech was putting
all its eggs in one basket banking on a five-
man offensive to reduce some of that lop-
sided midland lead

 empy bower advanced cautiously
toward the opposing center as he left his
zone flash ormond turned and raced to
the center post stewart deserted his
guarding man and dropped back to mona-
hans side in a split instant carter
sensed the play an attempt to confuse
the defenders by juggling positions he
moved up quickly to cover stewart who
was racing for the side court he shouted
a quick word to gordon

  shift

  gordon hesitated briefly then doggedly
remained at his defense position a three-
man offensive seized the opportunity paced
the ball down the right court and ended
beneath midlands hoop legs monahan
tapped the ball in for the tech score

  in the line-up gordon simulated indig-
nation

  watch your own zone carter he
snarled they scored again through your
position thats the fourth time tonight

  you were flat-footed flashed carter
i warned you to shift defense that time
i had to come over to cover stewart
monahan was your man 

  are you trying to tell me how to play
demanded gordon hotly say gawky
ive got a notion to-

  the referee sounded the warning whis-
tle bower nodded to his teammates then
put the ball into play he raced it out of
midland territory in regulation time then
spun and shot it back over his shoulder to

hal gordon while the two forwards moved
into the enemy court this was the double
running-guard routine pop brighton had
mapped out for his charges a plan calcu-
lated to force back the opposing defense
leaving either of the two sharpshooting
backfield men free for a scoring try from
or a trifle beyond the center stripe when
one shot the other stepped back immedi-
ately to his own basket as a primary de-
fense man

  gordon took the ball unmolested tapped
it once or twice on the boards and started
toward the shooting line carter began his
fade then suddenly without warning
hal wheeled and shot toward carter the
lanky boys desperate lunge jounced the
sphere off his fingertips it struck the side-
line just at the center line and then rolled
out

  outside tech droned the official

  monahan made the toss-in to ferraro
who razzle-dazzled to sproule the tech
guard shot a lofty looper to ormond who
blazed down the sideline to score from sui-
cide corner and a few seconds later as
the chagrined midland squad once more
dallied with the ball near center court the
referee tooted the signal that ended mid-
lands first conference game of the young
season

fqo what happened then asked betty

  o	carruthers

  pop brighton shook his head slowly

  that was all when i came into the
dressing-room they broke apart gordon
went into the showers and carter went
back to his bench i think they hoped i
hadnt noticed anything but how could i
help it the air was charged with ill-feel-
ing between the two

  he grunted to himself

  when i discovered carter i had hoped
that this would be a midland year but
no team with two warring members can
can make the grade with the kind of com-
petition were due to meet from now on
those two boys must settle their differ-
ences if were to get anywhere

  betty rose

  well pop ill have to be running along
now i have lots to do she patted the
worried coachs arm affectionately dont
worry about carter and gordon perhaps
theyll be all right-shortly
gawky for guard



  i hope so said brighton gloomily i
certainly hope so

  betty smiled and left the mentors office
as she swung up the campus lane she re-
volved the question of the gordon-carter
feud in her mind it was perfectly obvi-
ous that gordon angered by her seeming
interest in the gawky lad was the insti-
gator of the trouble and that meant that
if she were to re-create good will amongst
the members of the basketball team she
would have to take the hot-headed three-
letter man into her confidence

  disconsolately the girl recognized that
what had started out as a harmless little
trick was rapidly turning into a juggernaut
that threatened her from every side on
that night when she had decided to win
carter over to the basketball squad by be-
ing the charm girl she had not foreseen
these complications that had arisen now
she was firmly impaled on the horns of a
dilemma not only was gordon enraged
because the country boy had evidently
found the inner track to her heart-but
within the past week dan carter had dem-
onstrated more and more clearly that his
feeling for her was something deeper than
admiration

a crisp footstep behind her roused
her from her moody reverie it was
hal gordon himself and even as he
opened his mouth to speak she knew that
there was more trouble coming

  ive been looking for you began hal
roughly i want to get this gawky car-
ter business straightened out once and for
all just where he stands-and where i
get off

  and then betty told him told him the
whole story how in an effort to save
pops job she had deliberately lured the
clumsy boy into the one sport at which he
was skilful gordon listened unbeliev-
ingly at first and then with growing amuse-
ment as she finished her explanation

  -and so hes playing now she con-
cluded and with five good first-team
men pop has every reason to hope for a
championship year that is if you and
carter will bring your feud to an end
gordon laughed buoyantly

  i might have guessed if i hadnt been
such a darned fool i would have known
that a smart girl like you could never get

really interested in a hayseed like carter

  betty laughed weakly to her own sur-
prise she felt a tug of resentment at gor-
dons superior attitude but it would be
futile now to undo whatever good she had
done

  this is a howl on gawky continued
gordon exhuberantly well the big sap
asked for it let him stew in his own
gravy but mind you young lady after
the season is over you and i have a lot
of making up for lost time to take care of
and until then-well give the rube a good
ride he has it coming to him

that night for the first time since
his friendship with betty carruthers
had developed into an important part of
his life dan carter found the girl poor
company

  he missed the gay laughter that was so
much a part of her

  puzzled he had dared at last to speak to
her haltingly as they stopped at the tri-
gam house

  what is it betty is it something ive
done 

  the girls eyes tried to meet his then
dropped how could she tell him that it
was not him but herself that she despised
this evening  his awkward but honest so-
licitation for her added extra fuel to the
fires of recrimination burning within her
and suddenly betty carruthers realized
that she had never known a person quite
like dan carter before

  she saw him now as for the first time
with eyes suddenly startled by a new knowl-
edge and when she spoke there was a
new note in her voice a faint throbbing
that brought an answering beat to dans
heart

  no its something ive done dan
something i wish i could do differently
now

  what is it he asked gently maybe
i can help you set it straight

  she shook her head blindly

  dan ive been so foolish and i cant
even tell you how-now her voice fal-
tered

  he looked at her long and searchingly
found within her eyes that which gave him
the right to do what he had longed to do
it seemed all his life he moved forward
to her as she lifted her head their lips
	basketball stories

met and held in the first kiss of newly dis-
covered love then with a tiny sob the
girl turned and fled into the big house

pop brighton a huge grin wreath-
ing his weather face sat on the sideline
bench and watched as the green raiders
of midland swept into the final minutes of
play with an overwhelming lead against
their opponents

  these past four games had convinced
him that this was as he had hoped the
dream-team that would salvage his self-
respect and save him his job at midland
no longer was the green squad the quintet
of in-and-outers that had eked out bare
victories in its opening matches in suc-
cessive weeks pops boys had pounded
out convincing lickings to weslayan craig
and rothesay tonights win-for with
the score already - it could hardly be
anything but a win-would bring the
green to the seasons halfway mark with
a perfect slate at that rate the conference
title would be in the bag long before the
season ended so pop grinned

  on the field a machine-like quintet
worked in perfect harmony to plow
through the marston bisons and score al-
most at will

  wilkinson and hapes were demons on
offense twin scoring threats amply sup-
ported by their superb pivot man empy
bower and the second line since their
petty private warfare had vanished miracu-
lously more than a month ago was taking
the lions share of credit for midlands
victory streak gordon and carter their
differences patched up were like two
smooth pistons working in an oiled groove
each one a pillar of defense when the
enemy threatened each one a dangerous
scoring threat himself when carrying the
ball

  so pop mused and watched with a
happy eye as the bison forwards raced
down into midland territory passing the
ball back and forth between them in a
frantic attempt to upset this stone-wall that
repulsed their every effort

  another spectator seated with a group
of her sorority sisters just a few seats away
from the coach smiled happily within
these recent few weeks betty carruthers
had somehow forgotten that a time loomed
in the not too distant future when she

might have to pay the piper for little white
lies told months ago

iv

midlands basketball season was
not a crowded one but it was tough
within a three hundred mile area centered
about midland college were eight colleges
of almost equal size traditional rivalry
amongst these scattered campuses had long
since crystallized into the formation of a
tight hard conference league each year
as the various athletic seasons waxed and
waned teams from the well-matched col-
leges met and battled for supremacy in
baseball basketball football and such
minor sports as track tennis golf and field
hockey

  each school naturally met occasional
teams outside of the conference but some-
how these other games did not seem so im-
portant nor did they bring out the full
fighting spirit of the players midland
alumni still tell with awed respect of that
famous midland doomed battalion
which in the final game of the season after
having lost nearly every previous gridiron
battle woke to roaring life and battered
out a victory over a powerful norcross
conference eleven which just a few weeks
before had met and defeated a mighty
fordham squad

  that was one reason why as the weeks
rolled on pop brighton could not afford
to let his pace-setting charge let down for
even one game against the parade of con-
ference teams that met them on the hard-
wood always a specter on the horizon
was the possibility that everett or nor-
cross or tech might slip up from behind
to topple midlands title hopes

  dont get it into your heads pop
warned the green squad that you can
coast from here on in norcross is just
waiting for us to slip and so is tech in
our two remaining games we have to face
everett and norcross and you know what
that means

  grimly the squadsmen nodded they
knew only too well what that meant for
low-ranking everett was one of the three
teams that had beaten the green on the
first round norcross was another since
those two losses midland had run through
the list again only losing one tight game
gawky

to a smooth-clicking vengeful tech quintet

  thus it was that the midland squad dug
in harder than ever pointing for the
everett battle on the following week-end
if they won that a tie-off was assured and
a clean win possible if norcross lost one
of its two remaining battles but if they
lost to everett again it was still anybodys
contest

to dan carter however there were
other matters of importance than the
desire to win the conference title in these
recent weeks a whole new world of activ-
ity had opened before him

  most amazing of all was the way in
which overnight hal gordons attitude
toward him had changed dan could
scarcely believe now that there had been
an afternoon when hal had threatened
him warned him to stay away from betty
or that there had been an incident in the
locker room which had pop brighton not
entered at the strategic moment would
have certainly developed into an open
brawl

  for no apparent reason gordon had un-
dergone a swift and complete change his
manner now was distinctly cordial even
friendly sometimes dan thought with a
faint groping doubt just a shade too
friendly as though the other guard were
in some subtle fashion mocking him but
in the face of hals continued bluff hearti-
ness dan put this unworthy suspicion
firmly away from his mind

  and then one afternoon following prac-
tice gordon came over and sat beside him
on the bench

  busy tonight dan

  nothing important replied carter
a few studies to make up but that wont
take long why 

  well said gordon casually i thought
if you werent up to your neck you might
manage to drop over to the house for a
little while some of the boys would like
to meet you

  carters heart leaped an invitation to
the phi tau house that could only mean
one thing-that he was being considered
for a bid

  say id like to he agreed quickly
any particular time

  whenever you want to make it about
eight we can shoot a little bridge and

for guard	

just chat about things said gordon ill
be seeing you then

  he moved away leisurely chuckling to
himself at the open expression of delight
on the big lanky fellows face this was
all fixed with the boys at the house they
would take carter for a ride so gently so
cleverly that he would not even know hed
been on the pan until he found himself
brown on one side or perhaps gordon
thought amusedly they could prolong the
fun a little tease the kid along for a few
weeks until the basketball season was over
then give him the works

  but if gordons intention was obscure to
carter it was plain to betty carruthers
that afternoon as she and the lanky guard
strolled across the campus she frowned at
dans delighted recital of gordons invi-
tation

  well whats the matter asked dan
finally as the girl maintained a thoughtful
silence dont you realize what this
means  arent you pleased 

  im afraid i do realize what it means
dan only too well tell me didnt you
have some trouble with hal earlier in the
season 

  yes but thats all over now explained
carter these past few weeks he has
been very friendly you know the
young man looked at the girl gratefully
i have you to thank for all this i mean
my breaking into the college social life and
all that sort of thing before you came
along and interested me in going out for
the basketball team i was a nobody every-
things different now i feel as if i belong
here in midland i see people on the cam-
pus whom i can stop and speak to i have
friends in my classes theres the team
and theres you

  dont dan begged the girl in a small
voice

  but its all your doing persisted
gawky if you hadnt suggested basket-
ball to me i would never have gone out for
the team i was all washed up with ath-
letics i thought i was a flop and i
was too until i had you to inspire me
dan promise me something inter-
rupted the girl swiftly say that you
wont go to the phi tau house tonight
but why

  i cant tell you why but there are
reasons you must believe me
	basketball stories

  come on he said youre just get-
ting all excited about something that may
not amount to a hill of beans anyway i
have to go now i told hal gordon id be
there

and you wont change your mind
betty i dont understand why youre
acting this way i want to go ever since
ive been at midland ive been hoping for
a phi tau bid

  very well there was defeat in the
girls voice defeat and a touch of fear
too but dan whatever may happen
after this remember that i asked you not
to go

later that evening before the crack-
ling fireplace in the chapter room a
group of phi taus were talking over their
recent visitor skeeter myers secretary of
the fraternity and editor of the college
daily spun a cigarette accurately into the
blazing hearth

  say listen hal he said thoughtfully
i understood you to say this carter fellow
was a heel

  gordon laughed

  i didnt say he was a heel i just said
he was a rube i brought the guy around
so you could get a laugh i

  well i for one didnt get a laugh said
myers curtly i didnt even get a snicker
as a matter of fact i rather liked him
im inclined to agree rumbled tod
hemingway from the divan i liked him
fine i thought you said he had a swelled
head gordon

  gordon stared this was not the kind
of aftermath he had been looking forward
to what was the matter with these guys
anyway 

  he has  he snapped curtly he thinks
hes the big shot on the basketball team
for one thing

  judging from the games ive seen
commented one of the brothers he is
hes put us in the running for the first time
in years anyway

  as a matter of fact myers said
seriously i think your little joke was a
flop hal im all for slapping a pledge
pin on carter

  dont be a damned fool rasped gor-
don he rose angrily the kids just a
hick a hayseed and as for basketball
-why he wouldnt even be out for the

team if betty carruthers hadnt turned the
heat on him shes been playing him for a
sucker ever since the season opened and
yet you fellows think-pfah he turned
on his heel and marched out of the room
as the assembled brothers looked after him
curiously

  finally skeeter myers nodded his head

  comes the dawn he said solemnly
im beginning to see a glimmer of light
gang

it was the night of the everett game
pop brighton watching his charges
warm up in pre-game practice felt a chill
of apprehension pass through him for
the past two days now he had had the un-
easy feeling that once again all was not
well with his quintet

  it wasnt that his men were overtrained
all of them were or seemed to be in top
condition for the stretch race nor could
their fault be overconfidence for he had
drilled into their heads the fact that nor-
cross and tech were each but a single
game behind the leading midland team
that a loss at this stage of the contest might
prove fatal

  a banner crowd was noisily jamming
the sideline tiers as the giant clock slowly
inched toward the starting hour midland
its first championship in years within sight
was proving its loyalty to the green raid-
ers who knows was the thought in each
rooters head but that tonights game may
end the race if midland wins and if
both norcross and tech are defeated-

  realizing the importance of these other
two matches the college daily had con-
nected direct wires with the craig campus
where norcross was playing the fourth
place team and with techs bailiwick
where the tech aggregation was meeting
lowly marston should craig and mars-
ton by some chance beat the two prime
contenders midland would be in regard-
less of the last season match with norcross
therefore skeeter myers campus news-
paper was planning to bring to midlands
fans the results of these other contests as
they came in

  a warning whistle sounded and the prac-
tice squads left the boards pop brighton
gathered his team about him for a word
of last-minute advice

  as you know he told his starting five
gawky

tonight may wind up the race if we win
and if you boys play as you played against
weslayan and rothesay well win but
we wont win if you play as you practiced
yesterday and the day before that

  you know what i mean you gor-
don-a little more teamwork with your
running mate and you carter-less
fumbling now get out there and win

  dan carter striding into his position
stole a glance at the left guard to see what
reaction pop brightons words had set up
he recognized the value of pops words
in these past few days-ever since hal
gordon had asked him to visit the phi tau
house the other guard had been acting
queerly again had been acting much as
he did in those early season games sulky
and rebellious when he wras forced to
pass to carter he did so in a style that was
ofttimes impossible to handle and when-
ever possible he tried to hog the leather
refusing to allow his fellow guard to get
into the play

  hal must be sore about something but
what dan shook his head it was be-
yond him he turned and looked into the
midland stands and a smile lighted his
face as he found that for which he had
been searching-a slim hand waving en-
couragement to him a girl whose eyes
would be upon him throughout the game
dan grinned well to hell with gordon
and his moodiness hed play this game
as he had played all his games for her
for betty

empy bower leaped high at the top-
off to swing the leather from the
everett center but hi jenkins fingers
touched it first and flicked it into the wait-
ing hands of the right forward kinky
henley

  carter smothered his man successfully
made him return the ball to jenkins who
turned and whipped it to the other side of
the court where bill darrah racing down
the sideline eluded the primary defense
man to enter scoring position

  this everett outfit had beaten them once
before dan remembered and they mustnt
repeat he deserted his man momentarily
feinted out of position and returned just
as darrah whipped the ball toward hen-
ley carters long arm snaked out spun
the ball in to him and the midland four-

for guard	

man offensive swung into action as wil-
kinson and hapes paced the ball-dribbling
running guard downcourt

  it was empy bower evading jenkins to
slip beneath the enemy basket who scored
the opening marker for midland everett
won back half of the two-pointer when
jenkins shot a single foul a few seconds
later but then the famed midland razzle-
dazzle really got under way

  wilkinson blazed the trail with mid-
lands second score dropping the ball in
on a bouncing back-pass from his running
mate hapes kept up the good work by
laying a sideshot through the still quaking
net empy bower missed a hard try but
leaped high in the air to follow it up with
the score that made it midland  everett 

  the everett squad called a time out and
when they came out of the huddle they had
abandoned their strict man-to-man defense
and assumed the five-man zone spread

  with this midland countered by switch-
ing to their a court formation forcing
the defense deep with a three-man threat
forward and depending on carter and gor-
don for the pointers and the plan
worked  dan laying two through the hoops
from midcourt and relaying one to gor-
don for yet another score

  so far the game had been one-sided but
fast pop brighton stripped his left side
sending in blane at forward and oday at
guard to give wilkinson and gordon a bit
of rest against the weaker side everett
rallied to pile up three court shots and a
foul but unperturbed pop took out his
right side for a breather he was going
to win this game if possible under wraps
for the chances were great that there
would be another and an even tougher
match the following week

  it was in the closing minutes of the first
half with the score now at - that the
entire first team once more took the field
this time as empy bower replaced reach
rochester wilkinson turned to his team-
mates with the lets go look in his eyes

  and the midland machine went a be-
wildering maze of spheres began to whip
through the rattled everett defense as in
rapid succession wilkinson bower and
carter added tallies for their teams once
hi jenkins lobbed a desperate try from
midcourt to chalk one for his team and
dave johns slipped an interception through
	basketball stories

the cords for the everett squad but the
visitors were clearly outclassed and as the
final toss-back from bower to carter al-
lowed the running guard to leap high and
toss one cleanly through the basket mak-
ing the score - the whistle signaled
the end of the first half

  cheers and applause followed the green
raiders to the dressing-room but as he
and his teammates passed the stands dan
carter had eyes for only one of the enthu-
siastic rooters

in the locker-room pop brighton was
elated

  its practically on ice men the only
thing that can lose this game is a miracle
or a complete collapse on your part and
im not expecting that not from the way
you looked out there this first half

  skeeter myers burst into the dressing-
room his eyes excited

  got the reports on the other games
gang

  well

  listen to this craig is beating nor-
cross at the end of the first half craig
 norcross 

  there was a shocked silence for a mo-
ment  then a roar of applause amongst the
squad

  a walkaway shouted jack hapes
they cant win now norcross is out of
the running how about tech

  myers drew a deep breath

  the tech game started a half hour be-
fore ours i have the result in the middle
of the second half marston  tech 

  pop nodded grimly

  that settles it men we cant coast
yet if tech beats marston were still in
a battle

  nevertheless it was a rejuvenated squad
that talked happily in the midland locker-
room during the remainder of the rest
period norcross seemed definitely out of
the running and there was an even chance
that tech might take a licking if both
teams lost the title was in the bag tonight
next weeks game with norcross would
be merely a gesture

  only one member of the midland squad
was not smiling as the team climbed the
stairs to the court for the second half
that one was hal gordon if norcross
and tech lost tonight and midland

clinched the title the season would have
passed to all intents and purposes with-
out carter ever having been satisfactorily
put in his place and gordon was de-
termined to sooner or later show the coun-
try boy up his jaw was set grimly as
they re-entered the thronged gymnasium

  pop brighton perfectly willing to pro-
long his star performers rest allowed the
entire midland second team to start the
second half it hardly seemed important
that the everett team taking the floor with
new determination came through with a
brand new style of technique to increase
their score to - as the slow minutes
ticked away pop knew well that when he
returned his first squad later on any in-
crease the everett boys made would be
rapidly wiped away and so he bided his
time resting his stellar quintet while he
kept a watchful eye out for skeeter myers
and the news from the other two battle-
fronts

  it was midway in the second half that
the expected message came myers raced
into the gym picked up one of the huge
megaphones used by the cheer-leaders and
shouted the news that all present might
hear

  the final result of the tech-marston
game he cried is-marston  tech


  and then pandemonium broke loose in
the midland gym

floundering midland second
team was looking hopefully toward
the bench pop brighton at peace with
the world now that his dream of again
producing a winner had been fulfilled
nodded happily to his first-string men

  ok fellows sew it up

  a cheer rose from the stands as the
starting five swept out onto the floor
betty carruthers felt a tug at her heart-
strings as a lean but somehow graceful fig-
ure in shorts turned and smiled her way
he might be gawky to his teammates and
gawky he might be on a football field
but on the boards his smoothness his ease
was a marvel to behold

  everett having just scored to make it
- the green raiders once more put
the ball into play and for the second time
that evening the spectators sat back to en-
joy the spectacle of this smooth midland

machine exerting its full and deadly power

  hapes keynoted the green attack on an
immediate solo that carried him into the
suicide corner jammed there by the stub-
born guard chumley he tossed back to
carter who laid one cross-court to wilkin-
son wilkinsons try never touched the
sides of the hoop

  jenkins brought the ball out for everett
passed it to dave johns gordon stepped
in fast and intercepted then turned and
whizzed a vicious liner to dan carter who
was already on his way upcourt a grim-
ace wrinkled carters brow as the bound-
ing leather burned into his palms his
shot for the basket was inches off the ball
rolling on the rim then dropping free

  darrah passed swiftly to jenkins who
lifted another everett score into the mid-
land hoop

  the same crowd which had only a min-
ute before been whooping it up for the
wonder five fell now into a strained si-
lence they sensed something wrong pop
brighton looked sharply at his charges
the old trouble had come to life again
the gordon-carter feud had been re-
newed the old coach watched with grow-
ing despair as the midland backfield strife-
ridden fell into a rout

  gordons passes to carter were all either
too hard to handle or just a trifle beyond
the gawky ones groping fingers the clean
defense support which had characterized
the defense mens work had given way to
individual playing and as a result everett
was sinking shots that should never have
been allowed

  wilkinson hapes and bower were sup-
porting their squad rising above them-
selves to match everett pointers with tallies
of their own but as the closing moments
of the game ticked slowly on the under-
dogs threat became a possibility for the
score now stood midland  everett 

and then pop brighton made a gam-
bling decision he gambled on the
ability of inferior players to hold that fight-
ing everett squad where two warring
members could not he jerked carter and
gordon from the game substituting bran-
nigan and oday

  the combination was weak but it held
held well enough at least so that just as

the final gun sounded in the now-silent
gym the green raiders still managed to
lead their opponents by a border-line
margin

  and it was then just as a group of vic-
tory-mad rooters swept down from the
stands toward the barely triumphant mid-
land squad that hal gordons long-smoul-
dering anger burst into flame and he chose
to make public the vengeful rancor that
had been burning within him throughout
the past weeks

  he escaped from the bench a sneer on his
lips and clutched dan carters arm

  you certainly showed plenty of stuff
on the ball tonight gawky he spat but
it was just the kind of stuff i expected
from you sucker stuff

carter turned slowly his lean hands
clenched in a tight knot

  im not sure he said slowly that i
know what you mean gordon

  naturally not gibed the hot-headed
guard a dumb cluck like you needs a
diagram well its all over now and the
titles on ice so at last i can tell you what
a sucker youve been do you know-
a slim figure struggled suddenly from
the throng of astonished fans gathered
about the pair betty carruthers clutched
at gordons arm

  no hal not now please

  go ahead gordon ordered carter
  pop pleaded betty

  the veteran coach who had been caught
unawares by gordons sudden flare-up
suddenly regained control of his senses

  gordon carter he snapped down
to the locker-room both of you make it
snappy

  obediently both men swung toward the
staircase hal with that belligerent sneer on
his face carter puzzled as the wonder-
ing crowd slowly dispersed betty turned
to her fathers friend tearfully

its all my fault pop i started it
save it betty said pop curtly ive
got to get down to the locker-room those
two boys will be fighting it out if im not
there to stop them

  he disappeared as betty disconsolate
sunk to the players bench for long min-
utes as the gym slowly drained its contents

of spectators she sat there wrapped in
thought the fat was in the fire now pop
could stem gordons words for a little
while but sooner or later the truth must
come out

  the moments ticked slowly by it might
have been ten mintues or it might have
been a half hour before the sound of ap-
proaching footsteps roused the girl from
her apathy it was carter and by the look
on his face betty knew that gordon had
spilled his malicious tale the lanky guard
walked slowly toward her his face stony
dan

there was a leaden quality to his voice
betty i want you to tell me one thing
honestly is gordon right did you make
love to me let me fall in love with you
just so i would play basketball

  dan you mustnt believe that cried
the girl desperately

  grimly he shook her away

  did you

  at first-yes  but later-

  never mind there was no anger in
his voice just deadly weariness hope-
lessness i can guess the rest never
mind explaining

  but i must explain dan you must
listen at first it was all a gag but after-
ward-

  he laughed shortly

  the seasons over betty and pops
job is safe you neednt pretend any
longer i was a fool to think a girl like
you could fall for a bird like me

he turned on his heel and strode away
as the girl stared after him helplessly hope-
lessly as the door closed behind him she
found her voice wrenched out one word
dan

  it was there that pop brighton found
her sobbing on the bench in the empty
gym he put his arms about her consol-
ingly

  everything will be all right betty
hell understand-later on

  b-but hell never play basketball again
sobbed the girl and hell never never
believe that i really do love him now
never

  he will when he has had time to
think it over it may take a little while
and as for the basketball-well that
doesnt matter now

  he stopped short as a wild-eyed skeeter

myers his hair on end raced into the gym
clutching a scrap of paper

  pop listen i just got a wire report
from the craig campus norcross made
an uphill battle in the second half and the
game went into extra time and the final
score was norcross   craig 

  it was pop brightons turn to drop as
though stricken to the bench

a ruddy glare threw shimmering
waves of light against the ivy-clad
walls of old main circled about the gi-
gantic pep fire more than three thousand
eager midland voices joined in the salute
to their alma maters near-championship
team a slim figure in white crouched
made sweeping movements with its hands
and the traditional challenge of midlands
long m split the night

  tomorrow morning a trainload of de-
termined norcross hoopsters would roll
into the little college towns station to-
morrow night the green and the gold
would decide finally the question of the
conference title and tonight midland
campus was giving a  thuse to prove to
their cage stars that the student body was
behind them to a man

  with the cheer-leader showing the way
the loyal sons and daughters of midland
screamed for their favorites to step for-
ward one at a time

  then at the cheerleaders sign the de-
mand welled up and echoed to the far cor-
ners of the campus

  carter carter we want carter
pop brighton standing back from the
blazing flame of the huge bonfire shook
his head at the girl by his side

  i thought he might come forward when
he heard them calling for him but i guess
he wont

  there were tears in the girls eyes

  i havent seen him all week no one
has he goes to his classes and then he
disappears i even went to his boarding
house they told me he wasnt in its
no use pop he wont let me explain
the coach patted her hand

  he may come back yet he must or
else-

  he stared gloomily at the blaze this
weeks practice with bus brannigan and
gene oday futilely trying to fill the place
of the missing guard had shown all too
gawky

plainly the dependence of the green raid-
ers upon the lanky boy his was the eye
that made those back-field passes good
those midcourt markers deadly without
him the team was just a faulty machine a
motor with one vital sparkplug missing

  carter carter we want carter
cried the mob but no carter stepped for-
ward

on the outskirts of the milling students
a lonely figure with hat pulled down
and coat collar turned up stood and
watched the scene with mingled emotions
dan carter his hands sunk deep into his
pockets was torn by desires such as he
had never before known

  ever since that night almost a week
ago when he had learned from the lips of
gordon and then from the lips of the girl
he had learned to love of the ruse that had
lured him to midlands basketball team he
had kept himself apart from the college
life his whole desire now was to finish
out the semester three weeks hence then
he would take his credits and transfer to
another college-one far from the mid-
land campus a college where he could
start all over again and forget

  still there was indecision in his mind
sometimes he told himself that he should
have waited-waited until betty had tried
to explain anyway he shrugged what
could she tell him she had cheated lied
to him and of course now that she knew
there was yet another game to be played
she would try the same trick over again

  once a sucker always a sucker he
thought to himself grimly well i was
a sucker once but never again

  the crowd despairing at last of bring-
ing out the missing guard had broken into
the strains of old midland their boister-
ous gaiety vanished suddenly as the old
tune tossed to the frosty stars by their
clear young voices became something hal-
lowed and vital to each of them hats
came off and a new solemnity shone in
every young face

  dan carter turned away a curious chok-
ing in his throat

saturday night came and with it a
host of rooters eight thousand strong
to storm the doors of midlands palestra
green adherents were there and follow-

for guard	

ers of the gold too for norcross had sent
a victory-hungry mob of admirers down to
watch this final and deciding match on
the entire campus there was no subject of
conversation but the game that night
everyone it seemed was planning to be
there everyone but little skeeter myers
that is

  the life skeeter was complaining bit-
terly of a newspaper man is the life of
a dog while you muggs are watching
the game your beloved editor will be park-
ing his carcass by a desk trying to get the
story ready so you can read about the game
tomorrow nuts i think ill take up
knitting

  hal gordon getting ready to go to the
gym only laughed

  well win without you watching us
skeeter

  yeah maybe rasped the little editor
almost savagely and if we dont i know
whose fault it will be

  gordons face darkened

  what do you mean

  you know damned well what i mean
newspaper editors arent dumb my dear
fraternity brother if dan carter isnt in
that game-

  he stopped after all fraternity broth-
ers are supposed to overlook the faults of
their brethren

in the locker-room pop brighton ad-
dressed his men briefly

  i dont need to tell you that youre go-
ing into this game under a handicap
oday brannigan-its up to you two to
save this game and thats a big order
all i can say is go to it and do your
best

  silently the squad filed out of the dress-
ing-room climbed the short flight of stairs
to the gymnasium the walls and balcony
were jammed with a colorful crowd whose
cheers echoed and re-echoed hollowly
against the walls already the invaders
were on the court a fast strong looking
aggregation in their gala golden jerseys

  a few minutes of practice and the game
was ready to begin the surplus players
left the court the referee took his posi-
tion between the opposing centers shrilled
his whistle tossed the sphere-and the
game was on

  a wild cheer rose from the midland


basketball stories

stands as empy bower stole the tip-off
bounced the ball back over his shoulder to
hal gordon the gold hoopsters wary
of that vaunted green attack hastily swept
downcourt to defense positions gordon
smiling confidently ran the ball to mid-
field make a lightning pass to bower at
pivot position the towering centerman
spotted the basket spun the ball through-

	to 

  the gold put the ball into play came
up out of their court in a box-four forma-
tion hunk kolsky their pivot-guard re-
mained in the norcross court as miller and
easton the two forwards box-passed the
leather around between themselves and
back to center beano brophy and the gold
running-guard lafe arbogast

  bower cagily closed in on brophy as the
opposing center back-tapped the ball to
wally easton easton took it down the
sideline then whisked it to his running
mate tom miller hal gordon smothered
miller who spotted the leather back to
easton

  the flashy left forward came in fast
took the ball on the bounce and without
touching the wood placed it through the
hoops tie score

  once again the green raiders brought
the ball out this time the play was the
teaser-forwards in and the ball back
to gordon from wilkinson but wary
tom miller was covering gordon and the
right guard turned and spun the leather to
his teammate oday let the ball smack
his palms then bounce out as he went
to retrieve it his knee struck it it rolled
over the sideline as the ref droned out-
side norcross

  easton tossed in to miller then turned
and raced to a basket post millers relay
was perfect and the left forward had only
to leap lightly and tap the ball through the
hoop

  oday rattled closed in too fast on his
man the next time after easton had inter-
cepted a relay from bower and face-
blocked the gold front-line man just as he
shot the ref awarded two tries to the
fouled man and with calm aplomb easton
laid them both through the cords this
was eastons night already the gold had
found the weak spot in their opponents
defense and they were capitalizing on it
heavily and the score mounted little by

little as the first half moved along all too
speedily for the stupified midland rooters

skeeter myers seated in the of-
fice of the college daily scratched
angrily on a deskpad as he listened to the
reporter on the other end of the wire

  whats that  to  for norcross
what the hell kind of a lead can i write
if those bums are going to beat our boys
eh  to-say listen bill youre break-
ing my heart call me again at the end
of the half yeah so long

  moodily the editor slapped up the re-
ceiver he drew a long gust of smoke into
his lungs then grabbed his hat from the
desk

  im going to go down to the den he
growled to a sophomore reporter and
drown my sorrows in a cup of java stay
near the phone in case bill mcghee calls
again

he banged into the den slamming the
door behind him a quiet figure
seated at one of the tables looked up as
he entered then lowered his head skeet-
ers eyes narrowed dan carter briskly
he approached the ex-guards table sat
down

  have you heard about the game car-
ter he began abruptly

  the lanky lad avoided his eyes

  im not interested myers

  not interested hell exploded the edi-
tor its still in the first half and the
score is  to  in norcross favor doesnt
that interest you

  a momentary flame flickered across car-
ters eyes then died slowly

  sorry he said curtly im through
with basketball

  look here carter if youre just stay-
ing out of the game because of that betty
carruthers business-

  carter rose suddenly pushing the table
back in his anger

  i came here to be alone myers when
i want your snooping advice ill ask for it
now will you get out of here or shall i
there was a sudden dominance in the
little mans purpose that made him taller
commanding he rose to face the basket-
ball player

  shut up carter and stop being a fool
he shouted this is one time im going
gawky

to talk and youre going to listen now
the whole thing started this way-

  shocked into silence dan carter lis-
tened as the editor unloaded the knowledge
that had reached his ears through a hun-
dred campus sources and as the skeeter
spoke suddenly everything loomed clearer
and clearer in carters eyes

  youre right skeeter he cried

  his last words were lost in the crashing
of the door as he disappeared across the
darkened campus toward the lighted win-
dows of the gym from behind the
counter the manager of the den roared in
protest

 hey you my money you didnt
pay

  there was a broad grin on skeeter my-
ers face as he tossed a crumpled bill at
the owner

  keep the change mike i think we
can charge this one up to news breaks
ee-gip-ow-ee

a moment before there had been
deathly silence in the green raiders
locker-room silence born of defeat already
acknowledged now suddenly a wild yell
of delight split the steamy air as dan
carter wild-eyed and anxious crashed
into the room to claw at his locker with
eager fingers

  how much timeve we got he panted
whats the score quick somebody give
me a hand with this locker

  a roar greeted his words but with mo-
ments to spare dan carter recognized
that there was still other unfinished busi-
ness to attend to he strode over to where
hal gordon sulky and rebellious sat glow-
ering at him

  youre a rat gordon he blazed but
midland needs you to win this game do
you want your licking now or after the
game

  in reply the rival guard swung a short
jabbing right at carters jaw dan ducked
beneath it and came up with a smashing
uppercut to gordons chin the other
mans knees crumpled and he slipped to
the floor carter strode back to his bench
without a backward glance

  well play without him he snarled
and well win too

  a hoarse cheer of delight greeted the
midland squad as it raced up burning

for guard	

with a new fighting spirit ont of the
locker-room for the beginning of the sec-
ond half from her seat in the stands
betty carruthers looked once then gasped
incredulously as she recognized the lean
hard figure of dan carter in midlands
green the crowd recognized him too
and new hope swept over the midland root-
ers carter was back this game wasnt
over yet

  a purposeful hush fell over the palestra
as the two teams lined up for the tip-off
bower a mightier center than ever before
literally seemed to tear the ball away from
brophy on the toss and slashed it back
to carter carter zoomed it to wilkinson
-and before the gold could even get set
the score was  to 

  and then the mob went hoarse with
screaming delight as the rejuvenated green
squad fought the battle of its career a
smashing charging battle that pushed the
gold back into the shadow of its own basket
time after time to slowly but inevitably
grope the score to - - -

  but every team has its level-and the
level of even this inspired squad was not
up to that of the power of midlands com-
plete five and with that beggardly five-
point margin to overcome midlands blaz-
ing attack stymied norcross discovering
the new weak spot at right guard pushed
through bus brannigan twice to raise their
lead lost the increased points on a flip by
wilkinson and a long toss by carter and
there the game stalled as the precious
minutes of the second and final half moved
inexorably onward the green and the gold
zig-zagged back and forth to remain locked
with that five point difference

  pop brighton his heart sick with the
knowledge that this game under different
circumstances might have been won sat
staring at his stop-watch

  and then a hand cold and desperate was
clutching at the coachs shoulder hal
gordon-and in his red-rimmed eyes there
was a curious pleading look

  pop they cant win without me put
me in there

  pop brighton hesitated briefly on the
court a surprised midland squad seeing
gordon stumble up from the locker-room
had called a time out they were huddled
there now watching the tense drama at
the bench with questioning eyes
	basketball stories

  youve got to pop gordon pleaded

  the old coach nodded

  all right go ahead gordon

  the guard dashed in as brannigan came
out as he took his position dan carter
glanced at him thoughtfully if gordon
tried any of his funny stuff now it was all
over

  then the gold warriors were racing the
ball downcourt pressing back the green
front line empy bower covered the first
offense man coming into the near court
forced him to toss to arbogast jack hapes
slipped in before the toss he wheeled and
found the basket blocked passed between
his legs to gordon and as speedy tom
miller closed on the guard dan carter
knew that the test had come what would
gordon do would his pass be too high
too low hard

  then it came directly at him and as
the leather met his hands smoothly easily
he was off down the court like a streak of
green lightning eluding his guard  twist-
ing turning to flash the ball to uncovered
slip wilkinson and wilkinson laid the
apple right through the meshes as the
crowcd shrieked deliriously norcross 
-midland 

  it was norcross time to put the ball in
play as brophy took the ball the hand
of the timekeeper crept toward the gun on
the table he was watching the moments
that crept by closely only a fraction of a
minute now and norcross fearful of
this revived green squad was taking no
chances they brought the ball up oh so
slowly barely getting it out of their terri-
tory in regulation time and began to inch
it cannily warily toward midcourt

  desperately dan carter lashed out of
his defense position they mustnt freeze
that ball the whole game depended on
these last seconds of play

  like a ravaging wolf he flung himself
upon the ball-dribbler brophy brophy
startled as the long-legged guard closed
suddenly in on him tossed backward toward
arbogast and safety dan carter his feet
sliding beneath him reached out in a des-
perate lunge for the ball the smooth
leather just touched his finger-tips ho-
vered there an instant-and it was a free
ball skittering sidewise to the edge of the
court

  in a flash carter was back on his feet
the dismayed brophy had deserted him
racing after the ball tom miller was
after it too and hal gordon but it
was gordons fingers that clasped the
sphere first and lifted it in a mighty heave
to his running-mate- dan carter had no
time to crouch his arms moved like twin
pistons even as a resounding roar boomed
through the palestra the gun

  and the ball it struck the backboard
glancingly teetered hit the outside rim of
the basket and then as a tomblike silence
engulfed the open-mouthed spectators it
fell backward through the hoop

  it was then that bedlam broke loose

once again the gym was empty out-
side a throng of admiring midland
rooters waited for its court heroes to ap-
pear but the young couple standing to-
gether in the palestra had no ears for any
voices but their own

  you must understand dan the girl
was pleading hal gordon was right at
first it was all a joke but then when i got
to know you better-

  dan carter leaned over and stopped her
explanation in what seemed to him the best
and most effective way

  i do understand now dear he said
if i had been less stubborn i would have
understood before

  another figure was approaching them
across the boards hal gordon smiling
sheepishly he held out his hand to his
running-mate

  dan he began i dont know what
to say

  then dont bother hal grinned car-
ter anyway you said it a little while ago
-in actions lets forget the whole thing
im sorry about that poke

  im not confessed gordon ruefully
feeling his jaw it woke me up to a lot
of things one of them is that its not
safe to let a guy with a wallop like that run
around loose as soon as youre free i
wish youd come down to the phi tau house
again the boys have something to ask
you

  betty carruthers smiled softly

  dan can go to the phi tau house any
time he wants to hal she said but hes
never going to be free again

by glenn long

bronson was a born grandstander give him a gallery of
shrieking fans and he was a hard-wood riot-without it his
razzle-dazzle magic was a sure-fire flop

irvin loofburrow manager and
coach of the morganville red lan-
terns swaggered down the midway at
the county fair in mid-september nattily
clad and confident as usual that he was
what it took to make girlish hearts beat
faster yet despite this his mind re-
verted with disturbing frequency to prob-
lems of basketball one matter
especially the acquisition of a
high caliber forward was taking
the spring from his step and caus-
ing purple giraffes to dance on
his  bedposts during sleeping
hours

   at loofies side towering
 nearly a foot above him strode
 stretch warren his star cen-


basketball stories

ter in press notices loofie told the
bewildered world that the pink-cheeked
yellow-haired stretch could stand flat-
footed and lick paint off the morganville
courthouse clock a slight exaggeration
even though stretch was jix feet seven in
his thinnest socks but stretch was a
household name to basketball and he
worked hand-in-glove with handsome
loofie to outwit the sometimes unscrupu-
lous jasper marsden of brownstown and
maintain the red lanterns as the inde-
pendent basketball champions of the state

  he now scowled as he swung along

  we certainly will need a good forward
and need him bad he said

  ow-oo-oo you mention that while
i pursue diversion at this seventy-third
annual morgan county vegetable fruit
grain poultry and livestock exposition
howled loofie who prided himself on his
ability to make two syllables grow where
only one grew before let us banish our
multiple basketball sorrows and woo the
charming mademoiselle luck at yonder
emporium of light artillery

  they invested fifty cents each at the
shooting gallery before concluding lady
luck was not interested in being wooed
that way

  if we had a basketball hoop to shoot at
instead of a duck we might get some-
where exclaimed stretch in disgust

  verily verily quoth loofie as they
stepped back into the milling crowd

  but the speculative instant had fast hold
upon loofie

  stretch he said i proclaim to you
that as you would crudely say this is my
lucky day how are you disposed toward
the projection of a few spheroids at the
ethiopian bambinos 

  oke

  the two flung baseballs at black rag
dolls until their capital investment
amounted to one dollar and fifty cents and
their total returns one brown and white
china pig penny bank won by loofie

  loofie paid the final instalment on this
profitless enterprise as stretch stepped
back toward the current of the crowd the
dapper manager picked up his change and
the china pig which he reflected might do
as bait to catch a blonde and swung on
his heel in pursuit of his giant pivot man
as he drew alongside stretch gave one

 look at the china pig and felt a twitching
 of his heart that pig which retailed for
 a dime at any five-and-ten now repre-
 sented a total outlay of two dollars and
 fifty cents

   stretch mourned if we could only
 throw basketba-

   he stopped in his tracks and stared
 loofie stopped in his tracks and stared
 then they stared at each other

   at last loofie reverently breathed
 santa claus we are present

 forty feet ahead of them was a
 basketball backboard with hoop and
 net and before it basketball poised on his
 fingertips was a wiry young six-footer
 calling three shots for a dime folks
 three shots for a dime try your hand
 at the great american indoor sport win
 a souvenir arabian horse win an elephant
 win a lion win a great big beautiful kewpie
 doll with eyes like greta garbo

   loofie slithered through the crowd and
 smacked down a dollar bill upon the
 counter before the young man he nodded
 to stretch

   assume control of the ceremonies up
 to and including a valuation of one dollar
 and no cents

   stretch reached for the basketball and
 asked what are the rules

   three baskets out of three attempts
and take your choice of souvenirs said
the young man its a regulation foul
line shot and no preliminary throws
stretch made nine baskets in a row
he missed one out of his next three then
shot six straight and turned around to be-
hold a gathering audience it recognized
him and numerous persons called out
atta boy stretch break the bank
close him up start in business for your-
- self

   loofie saw the publicity value for stretch
 and the red lanterns stretch bowed to
 the cheers of the impromptu gallery when
 he had finished the dollars worth of shots
 he had seven prizes loofie tossed down
 another dollar

   the young man running the game pro-
 tested further shooting by stretch the
 crowd booed and threatened yellow
 run him out cant take it eh its
 all right when the other fellows losin
 aint it  let him shoot or take down your
 grandstander	

stand come on guys lets tear down the
place

  the young man unperturbed by the
threats finally accepted loofies dollar
with a faint smile the crowd roared as
stretch took eight more prizes leaving the
operator of the game only three

  loofie tossed out a half-dollar and the
crowd screamed break him send him
to the poor farm run him off the
grounds

  in response to the roman holiday
spirit stretch won the remaining three
prizes on four tries loofie felt a pang
of sympathy for the young man running
the game but after a quick appraisal de-
cided there was no occasion for condol-
ences merriment shone in the youths
clear blue eyes and he held his head as
one who had taken life on the chin many
a time yet was not even groggy as he
wraded in for more

  stretch surveyed the pile of statuary be-
fore him

  heck he said whatll we do with
them 

  mayhap loofie suggested looking at
the operator mayhap a satisfactory pecu-
niary arrangement can be negotiated for
their return to the immediate previous pos-
sessor

  the immediate previous possessor
shrugged

  i dont want em i have a whole truck
load

  he surveyed the crowd about his stand
the largest by far that his game had ever
attracted it gave him a deep thrill of sat-
isfaction

  tell you what ill do he said to
stretch ill shoot you double or noth-
ing well see who can make the most
baskets in a row if you win ill dupli-
cate every prize you have if i win youll
give em all back

loofie now felt he was the one who
should protest but the crowd was
cheering and he saw it would not be the
popular thing to do stretch had to ac-
cept the challenge which loofie knew in
his heart was a gross mistake he saw
all that stack of prizes taking wings and
affectionately gripped his china pig in a
moment ihat homely pig would be repre-
senting an investment of four dollars and

ninety cents and he had proclaimed this
was his lucky day 

  stretch made sixteen baskets before the
strain got him his seventeenth even
missed the hoop

  his challenger recovered the ball and
with a casual smile surveyed the throng
which still was cheering stretch the
cheers died as the confident air and un-
wavering calm of the youth- captivated his
audience it waited breathlessly  nd it
saw the youngster toss off sixteen shots
to match stretchs with the precision of
a machine they rustled the net like a
light breeze never even touching the hoop
then he calmly pushed in the winning shot
with his right hand

  the crowd that had been so antagonistic
so short a time before howled its delight
inspiring the young man to a demonstra-
tion of real wizardry while the onlook-
ers gasped he tipped in shots with his
wrists elbows and forehead he banked
them from all angles he made the ball race
half a dozen times around the iron and
come to a complete stop before falling
through in fact he made that basketball
do everything but croon a blues song

  finally he missed on his thirty-second
shot which was the last of three he assayed
to make while blindfolded and he missed
that one only after it had circled the hoop
three times and poised on the brink practi-
cally long enough for lunch

  wow chorused the crowd

  loofie who had risen from the depths
to the heights rang in with wow-wow-
wow-wow true to his penchant for rais-
ing more syllables than anybody else suc-
cess was written upon his brow and he felt
future generations would list him next to
columbus as a discoverer he socked
stretch in the ribs

  did i not inform you he cried that
this was my fortunate day

  he pointed to the youth with the basket-
ball

  behold the new super-phenomenal for-
ward of the morganville red lanterns

there was no joy in the neighboring
city of brownstown when ljofie sent
them word that morganville had signed
up for the coming season a new forward
named bunny bronson who could stand
with his hands behind him and shoot
	basketball stories

baskets with his ears jap marsden who
managed the brownstown merchants and
felt all was fair in basketball as long as he
was doing it went about for a week slam-
ming doors and frightening small children
the remote trouble was that morganville
had displaced brownstown in recent years
as the basketball capital of the state but
the immediate difficulty had to do with the
fact that after being nosed out last year
for the state championship in an overtime
game jap had put out perfectly good per-
sonally owned cash to lure jingles dengle-
myer star forward away from the red
lanterns he was successful in getting
denglemyer but it was now all too evident
that he merely had taken one good for-
ward away from the lanterns to make
room for a better one

  loofie loofburrow daily laughed riot-
ously and his raucous guffaws were more
than japs ears could bear jap groaned
and moaned like a newly orphaned calf but
everyone knew that although he could be-
come more deeply buried in gloom than a
centipede with ninety-nine broken arches
he invariably bounced back to carry his
and brownstowng spirits to new altitudes
of optimism

  high-handedly jap had ruled indepen-
dent basketball for years before morgan-
ville in sheer wrath and civic pride arose
and smote him down he was a sharp icy-
eyed trickster not averse to very low
comedy yet he always gave the cus-
tomers a run for their money and every-
one knew the sure way to the state cham-
pionship was to beat brownstown

  morganville started the current year with
that idea in mind and in an early game on
their home floor took the merchants to
the tune of - before a capacity crowd
that had turned out to see the new super-
player bunny bronson toss everything
through the basket but the timekeepers
watch

  as the crowd went wild bunny went
wilder tall trim tireless a veritable hu-
man greyhound he covered every square
inch of the court and to the astounded
spectators appeared to have some miracu-
lous knack of being in no less than three
places at once in one smooth unbroken
flow of motion he would take a ball off the
enemy backboard pass to a fellow lantern
take a return pass at mid-floor pass again

and then bound under the basket to con-
tact the ball for a lightning tip-in and raise
the red lantern score two more points
and the temperature of the crowd two more
degrees

  jap marsden chewed his tongue and
moaned as it became evident early in the
game that the merchants had no more
chance of victory than a cow has to out-
fly lindbergh

  bunny bronson bronson jap mut-
tered where have i heard that name be-
fore that boys not hot hes torrid they
must warm him up in an electric furnace

hearts beat high in morganville as
the red lanterns clowned through
four more victories citizens dreamed of
a fifth state championship which would give
them permanent possession of the huge
james c parrott gold cup for which inde-
pendent teams had battled a decade and a
half with a forward like bunny bron-
son and a center like stretch warren how
could they lose

  then as if fate were showing them how
they could lose bunny bronson slumped
worse than two stock markets in a game
against the erie roundhousers which
bunny should have won by himself he was
held to four points a field goal and two
free throws the fans decided he was
merely coasting but loofie loofburrows
eagle eye detected something radically
wrong although he was unable to diagnose
it

  three nights later against the equally
weak green valley creamery quintet
bunny was just as bad again making but
one field goal although he managed to
amass three foul tosses the following
week he connected for three field goals
against the capitol city power and light
cagers but was obviously listless and dis-
interested

  loofie was about to conclude lady luck
had lifted him to the stratosphere only to
let him loose without a parachute when the
topnotch gilderson packers steamed into
morganville to play to a packed house
bunny bounced back into form as suddenly
as he had slumped and scored twenty-seven
points in a - victory the strongest
hearts in morganville were two days in
returning to normal it was such an out-
standing exhibition of the hardwood game
 grandstander	

as it should be hardwooded that loofie paid
no heed when bunny slumped again against
the holloway electrics and hit an all-time
low of one field goal and one charity
marker

  but if loofie was asleep not so jap
marsden

  where theres rhyme theres reason
and ill figure it out eventually if not now
he told gabby bordner elongated co-angel
of the merchants who had sunk so much
cash on them his wife was threatening to
run away with a relief worker so shed
again have money to spend

a few days later jap burst into gab-
bys auto service shoppe filled with
joy and sunshine

  i have it i have it he shouted

  st vitus dance asked gabby
well it aint sleeping sickness im
wide awake always and i have solved
the mystery of bunny bronson he is
a one hundred percent grandstander

  he made us look like one hundred per-
cent bums

  trust me that hell never do it again
  yeah oh yeah

  yeah oh yeah take a look at this
jap thrust a chart in front of gabby
which had all the scores of the morgan-
ville games plus the attendance at each
plus the individual scoring records of
bunny bronson

  look here he said a packed house
against us at morganville and bunny
scores twenty-one points twelve hundred
at the big four game and he goes through
for nineteen points and so on with the
big crowds but now look here against
those floundering erie roundhousers at-
tendance three hundred and four points
for bunny against green valley at-
tendance two fifty with our hero scoring
five points then back in morganville
again for the gilderson packers another
houseful of maniacs and bunny hits for
twenty-seven points while covering the floor
like a circus tent and still finding ample
time to keep his eye on two brunettes and
a blonde in the galleries

  the lad is a genius said gabby

  yes darn it but look at this game
against the holloway electrics the at-
tendance wasnt as big as the score and
bunny sank to three points its simple

  yes its even idiotic not to mention
half-witted

  itll be master intelligence when it has
brought a state championship again to old
brownstown gabby have you no imagi-
nation

  jap youd be astonished at my imagi-
nation its amazing stupendous colossal
the only trouble is it never coincides with
the scorekeepers card after the timekeep-
ers final gun has done its stuff if you get
my meaning

  a sad expression came over japs face
for a moment

  i know old pal i know boy how i
know that lousy loofie and his mor-
ganville red lanterns

  jap floundered only a moment in the
depths of bitter memories and then was
off again and zooming

  but this is our year our next game
with the lanterns is on our floor and we
are also host to the state tournament we
cant be beat we cant be beat we cant
be beat

  hurrah we cant be beat thatll be
front page stuff in morganville like a flea
having dogs

  all right be a pessimist and enjoy it
while you can but listen well win against
old morganville not with our team but
with our spectators well keep them at
home then well send word to morgan-
ville that the tickets are all sold out and
theyll stay at home bunny bronson uont
have no gallery to play to and he wont
make any points to speak of and-

  what about stretch warren

  oh him lanky morrow is almost as
good as him and this time well pull brick
stanton over from his usual guard duty
over bronson and let him take care of
stretch while lanky is free to have a field
day

  gabby bordner scratched the back of his
neck which was his highly individual way
of saying he was virtually sold on the idea

  if bunny really is a grandstander may-
be it will work he admitted

  if he really is a grandstander he
cant help being one ive looked up his
past do you have any idea who his
father was

  gabby didnt have so jap unfolded the
whole story which made his theory of de-
feating morganville all the more plausible
	basketball stories

morganville contemplated de-
struction by heavy artillery gas at-
tack and air raid when word first came
that the brownstown gymnasium was al-
ready sold out for the merchant-red lan-
terns game there

  daffy wilkerson morganvilles all-
american basketball fan headed an in-
dignation committee of one and investi-
gated by long distance telephone he heard
jap marsdens sweet-voiced stenographer
coo no mr wilkerson there arc no seats
left no there isnt even standing room
only i guess youll have to watch the
game over the radio i am so-o-o-o sorry
for fully ten minutes daffy was voice-
less he tramped over the courthouse lawn
making signs with his hands and funny
noises with his mouth when speech re-
turned he delivered such an eruption as
the world had not known since vesuvius
covered up pompeii and herculaneum but
it didnt get him a ticket to the combat
even when he made a personal trip to
brownstown and explained he hadnt
missed a basketball game since victoria was
queen of england all he got was a blue-
eyed smile and a soft so-o-o-o-o sorry
which did not turneth away wrath

  jap told gabby bordner about it and
gabby said im thinking maybe you are
pulling this one too soon you can keep
morganville away from this game but
theyll find out about it and be roaring
mad and howll you keep them away from
the state tournament which after all is
what really counts

  jap tapped his high forehead

  ha the old master mind i have already
thought it out fear not and be of good
cheer

  which and a smile was all the satis-
faction gabby received at that hearing

two evenings later the great battle
with the lanterns opened up under
circumstances as strange as ever attended
any basketball game less than two hun-
dred favored citizens were in the browns-
town gymnasium with its seating capacity
of thirty-five hundred in brownstown
homes two thousand fans who had pur-
chased perfectly good tickets to the game
were sacrificing the high privilege of being
eye witnesses on the personal assurance of
jap marsden that he would bring victory

to brownstown if they remained home-
bodies for the evening and got the glad
tidings over their radios twenty miles
away in morganville an almost equal
number of hardwood bugs were tuning up
their radios for the game unaware they
were being out-smarted by the master mind
of brownstown

  but out-smarted they were and jap
marsden became a prophet with honor in
his own metropolis he prophesied a vic-
tory and a victory he got bunny bron-
son played like a slow motion movie he
made one basket in the first quarter when
he went through the entire second quarter
without as much as a shot at the hoop
loofie loofburrow in disgust and dismay
withdrew him from the game and sent in
phil kennedy whose only improvement
over bunny lay in the fact that he ap-
peared to be trying at least to play basket
ball

  by virtue of phenomenal floorwork and
exceptional accuracy stretch warren kept
the lanterns in the game during the first
half it ended - in favor of the mer-
chants stretch had hit five baskets out of
seven shots which was too good to last and
there was a limit to the number of times
he could propel his giant carcass the length
and breadth of the floor at winning speed

  midway in the third quarter stretch
slowed down and that smeared the old
handwriting right across the gymnasium
wall the merchants immediately opened
up a - lead and won going away by a
score of - over a lanterns squad that
floundered through the last quarter thor-
oughly demoralized

  brownstown residences poured basket-
ball fans by the score into the streets even
before the final gun and the mayor headed
a mammoth parade celebrating the first
brownstown victory over morganville in
five seasons and still all morganville
including coach loofburrow went to bed
not realizing how the triumph had been ac-
complished

loofie went to work at once to find
causes for the pathetic showing of the
great bunny bronson

  bunny he said you desire morgan-
ville to acquire another state title and that
golden trophy do you not v

  of course i do
 grands taisder	

  then impart to me the reason for your
deviations from winning form some mys-
terious power seems to drain from you all
your natural vitality upon certain occasions
cant you fight cant you evince the an-
cient varsity spirit cant you do and die
for dear old alma mater you are al-
ways reluctant to talk of your past but
of course you do have an alma mater some
place with your ability you could not
have escaped being lured to some institution
of higher learning ostensibly for the im-
provement of your immortal intellect
bunny grinned

  sorry i never went to college all i
ever did and died for was dear old alma
public and when alma didnt pay i
didnt die why if i hadnt had the big-
gest audience of my life that day at the
county fair i never would have shot
baskets the way i did against stretch i
know its not the proper spirit but-well
i guess ill begin at the beginning my
father was rabbit bronson

  the rabbit bronson basketballs great-
est player of twenty-five years ago
the rabbit bronson

 rabbit bronson bunny bronson
how superbly dumb of me not to have as-
sociated the names

  no doubt jap marsden asked me a
month ago whether i was not the son of
rabbit bronson dad was a great actor
a great guy to play to the galleries he
became an actor on the stage and then the
movies took him we were wealthy and
i had private tutors-until dad died and
misfortune swept away our money out
of the wreck i salvaged that basketball
game you saw me with at the fair dad
had invented it years before and always
kept it sentimental basketball was his
first love before the stage and the movies
and mother and i have toured the fairs
and made a living with it since i was six-
teen

  when the crowds were interested i put
on exhibitions of fancy shots i guess
im an actor like dad i liked to spell-
bind the people if they werent interested
neither was i and now its a habit i
cant shake it no crowd no performance
look at the scores and youll see i always
had my bad nights when there were small
crowds fill me up a gymnasium give
me stretch warren to take the tip-off and

ill beat brownstown any night in the
week

  loofie whistled and then went through
strange mutterings that sounded very much
like cuss-words

  are you he asked of the opinion
that jap marsden penetrated your secret
sure the brownstown players kidded
me about it

  loofie arose to his full height and raised
his hand like an old greek taking a vow
before his favorite god

  never he intoned never shall it
transpire again i will buy a thousand
tickets myself and present them in the high-
ways and hedges ere we do without a pub-
lic your alma public bunny bronson
then he clenched his fist and shook it
in the direction of brownstown venge-
ance shall be mine jasper marsden

loofie was alert as final arrange-
ments were made for the state tourna-
ment in brownstown he insisted that
morganville get a full allotment of tickets
which in view of her standing in inde-
pendent circles plus the virulence of the
basketball virus which incubated within her
citizens resulted in an apportionment of
eight hundred

  the time came  a warm misty satur-
day in mid-march the merchants and
the lanterns had waded through their
games on friday and were headed for the
finals in much the fashion they had headed
in that direction the year before and as
all the lanterns showed top form and
there were eight hundred tickets in the
pockets of morganville fans loofie loof-
burrow with his squad retired friday
night in a brownstown hotel to dream
pleasant dreams

  at ten oclock the next morning loofie
received a long distance telephone call from
morganville

  loofie shouted that star rooter
daffy wilkerson we are under quaran-
tine

  well

  well say goof ctont you realize
that means we cant get our delegation out
to see bunny perform  and when
brownstown hears about it theyll prob-
ably call off their delegation which will
mean the final game will be played before
practically empty seats
	basketball stories

  loofie felt cold chills do a marathon up
and down his spin he lost all appetite for
six cylinder words and shouted back at
daffy dont stand there and talk do
something we have a game in fifteen
minutes

  his voice trailed away into the mourn-
ful tones of a missouri hound-dawg bay-
ing at the moon

  at noon daffy called back

  loofie i cant do a thing doc ochil-
tree says there are four cases of scarlet
fever in town and hes county doctor he
says this damp weather is just the thing
for spreading the disease and he swears
every man who goes to brownstown for
the game tonight will get fined fifty dollars
personally im going to pay my fifty and
see the game but not a dozen others can
afford it

  say yelled loofie again forsaking his
pollysyllables four cases of scarlet fever
aint no epidemic and you tell doc ochil-
tree i said so

  suppose you tell him he left an hour
ago for a week-end visit in cincinnati
you mean even he aint coming to the
finals tonight

  not unless the finals are played in cin-
cinnati

  hes a traitor why thats treason
thats anarchy thats- great jumping
sacred cows doc ochiltree has prac-
ticed medicine in morganville for twenty
years but he was born in brownstown jap
marsden has pulled something crooked
doc ochiltree is a gangster and a highway-
man call the state health department and
make them lift the quarantine we have
another game at one-thirty ow-oo-oo-oo
loofie forgot a little of his misery as
the lanterns romped through their semi-
final game after which the agony came
back double-strength all he had to think
about until the final game at eight oclock
was the absolute certainty of losing it and
the championship unless bunny bronson
had a big gallery to play to

  at five oclock he had another call from
daffy

  the state health officer says he couldnt
lift the quarantine without making a per-
sonal investigation and his weeks work
was up at noon i guess hes under a code
of some kind too loofie were out-
smarted

  we who say any time jap mars-
den out-smarts me i hope to be the three
little pigs and get eaten up by the big bad
wolf

  well do something

  i am but  aint telling you about it
over the telephone and take a chance on
some brownstown operator overhearing
my plan ill see you at the corner drug-
store in thirty minutes

  all known speed records were broken as
loofie went back to morganville and in
less than an hour a great peace had de-
scended upon his soul and daffys let
brownstown do its worst

  long before the game began loofie
knew the quarantine was a part of a plot
to bind the basketshooting arms of the
mighty bunny bronson brownstown
people were not pouring into the gymna-
sium once more they were at home dial-
ing the local station on their radio and
with morganvilles delegation absent
there were less than five hundred specta-
tors in the gymnasium at the referees
opening whistle

  and that made bunny bronson a dub
the first quarter ended - in favor of
the merchants jap marsden howled
gleefully and pounded gabby bordner
upon the back then he turned around
and let gabby pound him

  loofie loofburrow paced along the side-
line muttering why dont they come
why dont they come

  at any rate they didnt come and the
merchants bounded off the floor at the
end of the first half leading - loofie
stunned sat gazing at a pair of pink ele-
phants playing tag on the backs of a row
of empty seats high in the galleries mut-
tering the while oh why dont they
come bunny bronson had not scored a
point

the second half was less than a min-
ute old when the eerie whine of a fire
siren brought loofie to life it was the
hook and ladder outfit from morganville
a few seconds later at an open window
high in the east end of the gym two rungs
of a ladder appeared immediately followed
by the full-inoon face of daffy wilkerson
he looked at the score board and waved
a signal what sounded like forty thou-
sand automobile horns broke loose
 grandstander	

  when the noise had died down daffy
roared in a voice that resembled the mat-
ing call of a foghorn come on you red
lanterns they tried to keep us away
jap marsden wont let us in the gym but
the whole cockeyed town of morganville
is present and from in here i give them a
play-by-play account of the game

  a stranger viewing the crowd outside
would have concluded morganville had but
a dozen citizens all male and one loud-
speaker but those inside naturally
judged the crowd by the volume of the
loudspeaker which had been stepped up to
sound like the voice of chicago just as
loofie had planned

  stretch warren heard the booming
voices and intercepted a pass in mid-air
tipping it to bunny

  daffy called to those outside stretch
has passed to bunny bunny is dribbling
under the basket he shoots its
good

  and that was the detailed account of the
next four plays as the lanterns pulled up
their score to make the count - the
morganville loudspeaker roared until the
gymnasium windows rattled like a parade
of  flivvers bunny was hot and get-
ting hotter jap marsden was getting
hotter too but not in the same way

  the merchants finally got the ball on an
out-of-bounds play and jingels dengle-
myer dropped one in from mid-floor to
make the score -

  on the next play stretch soared into the
air and intercepted a pass pivoting
quickly he arched it to bunny

  swish

  bunny seemed merely to wave at the ball
as it passed him and it rustled the net for
two more points daffy wilkerson and
the loudspeaker roared the way niagara
would like to thirty seconds later the
score was knotted and jap marsden saw
another championship eluding him he
stopped the game while policemen ordered
daffy wilkerson down from his high perch
and threatened arrest for disturbance of
the peace if so much as one small peep
came out of the loudspeaker again

  now lets see your bunny bronson
shoot baskets jap sneered at loofie as
the game was resumed

  bunny for a moment stood in a trance

sweeping the three thousand vacant seats
with his eyes then with bewildering
speed he scored twice from the field and
the lanterns had a - lead which they
increased by three more points as the third
quarter ended

  the final period was one long pain for
jap marsden stretch and bunny shot bask-
ets until the scorekeeper was writers cramp
and the radio announcer had knots in his
tongue the morganville delegation
crashed into the gym when the doorkeepers
became too sick to offer resistance jap
marsden shriveled up a little smaller with
each red lantern basket until by the time
the final gun ended the game with the score
- he was trying to hide under a chew-
ing gum wrapper

loofies heart was brave and valiant
once more though his knees still
wobbled from earlier events of the day and
evening he grabbed bunny by the hand
croaking eight-tube words once more

  wonderful son magnificent and
now i must confess duplicity it was not
morganville in its entirety outside there
but merely a dozen staunch supporters re-
signed to the payment of fifty-dollar fines
that we might annex another championship
their combined voices were amplified by a
loudspeaker i regret to have deceived
you but i doubted not you would perform
or succumb for dear old alma public
and you did

  bunny grinned

  yes and no he said and his eyes
giew a trifle misty at first i played for
my public and then the cops chased my
public away i stood there looking at
empty seats and the thought occurred to
me that maybe dad was in one of those
seats and i wondered how he would feel if
i failed to live up to the basketball name
of bronson and that gave me the some-
thing to fight for coach that you talked
about one day its not an alma public
and its not an alma mater maybe you
would call it an alma pater

  and when jap marsden heard about it
he resigned himself to more lean years for
he knew that with all his trickery he could
not bar the doors or place a quarantine
against the spirit of the great rabbit
bronson

live the king and
lo his imperial

troops throughout the country are dashing

should be the greatest season in basketballs
history

  to quote grantland rice basketball
has become the main winter game of the
nation east west north and south-
with nothing else even close-it has cov-
ered every section of the united states
and why not the thrill of long set-shots
swishing through the nets the magical ball-
handling the exciting speed of players
dashing from one basket to the other
bodies leaping high into the air keen strat-
egy and shrewd maneuvers are all in plain
view for the spectator to see and appre-
ciate more people play this game than
any other even though it is but forty years
old and can you blame them you dont
need a lot of expensive equipment just a
pair of sneakers the ball some hoops nailed

-basketball stories-winter

to a backboard and
youre set to play
one of the healthi-
est most exciting
games that keen-
eyed hard - plung-
ing sportsmen ever
invented

 and while
youve been out
risking pneumonia
to watch your fa-
vorite eleven cover itself with mud and
glory the boys have been practicing
their dribbling dodging shooting bas-
kets guarding learning the latest wrin-
kles in offense and defense from coaches
who must be on their toes to keep
up with their continually advancing com-
petitors and ive been checking up on
developments in the various sections of the
country so that you will know what to ex-
pect as the season gets under way

  but before i go out on a limb and pre-
dict which should be the best teams in the
country and why first let me show you
to what an amazing extent basketball has
grown in the past forty-odd years the
past season saw a total of eighty million
paid admissions almost as much as base-
ball and football combined

  throughout the country auditoriums
arenas gymnasiums and field-houses have
been reporting record-breaking attendances
one hundred and fifty thousand of the
most blase population in the nation watched
basketball in madison square garden alone
last year so much for spectator interest

  as for participants basketball is played
in twenty-two countries throughout the
world by approximately twenty million
players and has been included in the
olympic program in the united states
we have annual championships and inter-
sectional games which bring together teams



   nat holman dynamic coach of c c n y
 basketball for two decades has played and
 planned to make the modern court game
 a major world sport starting in newark
 he ranged east to bridgeport and west to
 chicago he hooped it up with the famous
 original celtics who in ten years never lost
 a series since  he has given all his
 time and wizardry to the crack teams of
 city college
	basketball stories

whose campuses are three thousand miles
apart a practice which is no longer a
novelty

  basketball receives intense attention
from the movies newspapers and radio
therefore there can be little doubt that
the game is the greatest in the world if
measured by any of the standards of size
of attendance number of players or amount
of interest as shown in periodicals

new developments

  but such matters are common knowl-
edge and can be passed over with mere
mention however there are several de-
velopments which i believe should be
brought to your attention

  most important is that madison square
garden has become the rose bowl of
basketball motivated by the desire to
bring the best in basketball to its patrons
ned irish the director has taken pains to
invite only the finest teams in the nation
to his arena realizing this quintets
throughout the length and breadth of these
united states are playing the best brand
of basketball they can in order to get the
coveted invitation which means a luxuri-
ous trip to new york not only with ex-
penses paid but with a neat profit to take
home

  there has also been proposed a national
intercollegiate championship tournament
and a committee with regional chairmen
has been set up the tourney will be held
in the municipal auditorium in kansas
city missouri how successful this initial
competition will be remains to be seen but
there is little doubt that if the tournament
is handled well the national collegiate
championships should in time develop into
something akin to the world series how-
ever well know more about this matter
next year

there has been only one important
rule change this season namely the
elimination of the center jump after a
basket has been scored this is a continu-
ation of the tendency which first expressed
itself in the abolition of the center jump
after a foul try has been successfully com-
pleted the new rule which limits the
center jump to the beginning of each half
and held balls was an attempt on the part

of the governing body to give the small
man a break hitherto teams carried a
human telephone pole as a center to gain
possession of the ball for them now that
after a basket has been made the ball will
be given to the team scored against the
bean-pole loses much of his value and will
probably be replaced by a somewhat
smaller faster man who can take an active
part in the teams offense thus the squads
with comparatively small centers will have
at least an even chance to maintain pos-
session of the ball which is rather impor-
tant because after all you cant score
while the opposition has the ball

  for several years now teams on the
west coast have been playing without the
tip-off and it has been shown in actual com-
petition that due to the fact that no time
is lost in putting the ball in play as for-
merly the game is a much faster one and
produces higher scoring contests as much
as six minutes of actual playing time is
added to the contest according to actual
tests

  another reason for the change was to
eliminate the roughness incidental to the
tip-off as the players attempted to gain
possession of the flying sphere in this
way much fouling has been eliminated
which again is a factor in making the new
game a speedier one the results of the
new change will therefore serve to make
the game a more interesting one for the
spectator play will now surge from one
end of the court to the other without ces-
sation no longer will a team be able to
monopolize possession of the ball because
of its height and a good fast small
team will thus have an even chance to cut
the opposition down to its size-for now
it gets the ball at least half of the time

  one further effect which the elimination
of the tip-off will have is that the squads
will now be numerically larger previ-
ously due to the relaxation periods which
occurred after the shooting of a basket
five men could play the entire game now
with the very essential rest eliminated
coaches will have to use more men to keep
the game going at high speed thus in
a sense basketball will no longer be a bat-
tle between two five-man teams but rather
a contest between much larger squads an
important point to consider is that coaches
who are not plentifully supplied with first-
the court parade of 



grade material may be forced to employ
the zone-defense because it is less wear-
ing physically on the players and thus less
replacements need be made

  however a zone defense nullifies cut-
ting and causes the offense to rely on
deft ball handling and set shooting ac-
cordingly the spectators may lose one of
the greatest thrills in the game-a sudden
dash for the basket a bullet-like pass and
a basket scored from close-up sentiment
against the zone defense is increasing for
this very reason coaches players and
spectators would not like to see games de-
generate into set-shooting contests but
they are continually being forced to adopt
the zone since the rules give that type of
defense an advantage i myself strongly
opposed to the zone in principle because it
nullifies speed afoot and shrewd screen-
ing tactics am therefore forced to use it
the zone defense permits a slow man to
play because he can get by on the at-
tack if he is a smooth ball handler and
on the defense he does not have to move
too rapidly it is fairly obvious that when
you can use a slower man the game must
be slowing down thus one of the chief
charms of basketball-its speed and fire-
may be partly diminished

  i believe that in the east sentiment
against the zone will increase with particu-
lar vehemence in the next season or so
such a reaction would be based on the
fact that the east has just adopted the
interpretation of the screening rule
which has been used throughout most of
the nation namely that a player is en-
titled to his position on the floor this
principle permits much more body contact
than easterners have been accustomed to
also it facilitates matters for the offen-
sive team to get a man clear for an un-
obstructed cut for the basket in a man-
for-man defense since the guard can now
be screened off from the man he is
guarding in an effort to counteract this
many eastern teams will adopt the zone
defense because in such a defense there is
no need to switch after a screen has
been set up

  i am convinced that a clamor against the
zone will arise when it becomes perfectly
clear that such a defense essentially makes
of basketball a set-shooting contest which
cannot possibly have the wide spectator or

player appeal that the present game has
in support of this contention i should like
to add that the american professional
league which is primarily interested in
pleasing the spectator has long prohibited
the use of this defense however since
the business of coaches is to produce win-
ning teams we are forced to use it i for
one however will be glad when the nation
at large is awakened to the menace which
the zone defense presents and the rules
amended so as to make the man-for-man
the only defense permissible

  one other slight alteration in the gov-
erning code has been made  face-guard -
ing from now on is not a foul unless
there is physical contact this change will
have but little effect on general basketball
strategy but it is hoped that many irritat-
ing incidents will be avoided

fire-horse play

with the growth of intersectional
contests provincialism in basketball
has been to a large extent eliminated with
the result that no style or system of play
is peculiar to anyone section of the coun-
try now that the screening schism has
been bridged i believe that the east will
adopt the pivot attack at the side of the
foul area to a much greater extent than for-
merly but in general the top-notch teams
in each section play the same type of bas-
ketball with a general tendency toward the
abandonment of set-plays which also per-
mit the defense to get set

  some coaches prefer to outscore the
other fellow and let the defense take care
of itself others first build up a good de-
fense and then work on their attack this
is true in all sports and is a matter of
individual conviction rather than one of
sectional bias it is true that in the east
the defense has in the past been stressed
more than in other parts of the country
but now that they too have adopted the
screening interpretation used in most
parts of the united states the east is also
going in for long passes and fast breaks
originating from a zone defense

  there is one style of play however
which has achieved a measure of success
but which is not yet employed on a large
scale i refer to the so-called fire-horse
style of play in which the defense attempts
	basketball stories

to cover the entire playing area rather than graduated gave stanford successive south-

merely the defensive half of the court
such a defense seems to be effective with
tall fast players however whether it
will stand up against fast adept ball-han-
dling remains to be seen it is certain
however that fire-horse basketball leads
to much scoring greatly increases the need
for stamina on the part of the players
since they must chase their adversaries all
over the playing area and needs plenty of-
reserves to keep the defense from falling
apart of sheer fatigue

two are tops

with teams and coaches in every sec-
tion of the country striving for vic-
tory and with no section being able to
maintain any clear-cut dominance the
chances of any one team completing a
schedule of from fifteen to twenty-five
games without- defeat are rather slight
accordingly i am not going to predict
that any team will go through the season
undefeated for it is almost impossible for
a squad to maintain its highest caliber of
performance throughout the long season
and in addition a team is fairly certain of
meeting opposition which is hot on a
particular night when it is itself not quite
up to snuff injuries ineligibilities fail-
ure of key-men to return to school unpre-
dictable sophomores etc-all in the hands
of uncertain fate--make this forecast of
mine something less sacred than gospel
nevertheless here goes

  with grace rather than the solemnity
which should accompany such action i shall
now name the team which i believe will
be acclaimed the best in the nation next
march-gentlemen i give you stanford
u niversity

  on the basis of their past performances
and the fact that only two of the grinning
indians will be missing this winter i think
that they will be the standout team of the
country once again led by hank luisetti
the sensational forward who has been
breaking scoring records with zest and fre-
quency ever since he came to stanford
the cardinals still have art stoefen jack
calderwood the zonne boys and a host
of others from exceptional reserve mate-
rial and freshman squads this array plus
dinty moore and howie turner who were

ern division and coast championships in
the past two years besides trouncing all
extra conference rivals and incidentally
breaking all sorts of scoring records en
route

  the squad is tall well conditioned light-
ning fast on attack and defense accurate
to a phenomenal degree in its shooting deft
in its ball handling and has an excellent
competitive spirit in john bunn they
have a coach who ranks with the finest
basketball mentors in the nation he has
provided them with a soundly conceived
attack and defense which takes every pos-
sible advantage of the players potentiali-
ties

  incidentally the amazingly accurate one-
handed push shot affected by the indians
has so impressed coaches who have seen
stanford play that we may expect more
frequent use of it throughout the country
the indians use a man-for-man and also
a zone defense in each case using their
height to great advantage on the attack
they employ the fast break set-screen
plays and are particularly strong in con-
trolling rebounds from both backboards
what more do you want

  just a shade behind the indians if not
on a par with them i place george keo-
gans notre dame squad the irish fash-
ioned an impressive record for themselves
last season and are all set to better it this
year the south bend squad has lost only
demots and allan reserves the past com-
paign and has veterans in all the starting
and reserve posts johnny moir and paul
nowak last years sensations are back and
in finer form than ever meyer brown
and wukavits will round out the starting
five

  notre dame plays an aggressive game
especially around the backboards where
they take full advantage of their height
weight and speed the irish are second
to none in the daring and spirited style of
of their play keogan has given them a
resourceful varied attack and defense
which revolves about nowak and moir i
believe that both notre dame and stan-
ford will have outstanding records with
the indians slightly more brilliant it is
exremely unfortunate that two such fine
teams have not been scheduled to meet

  from here on the role of the prophet
the court parade of 



grows more difficult and since few other
teams make transcontinental jaunts i will
eschew the job of nation-wide ranking and
give you something far more tangible-
how the teams will shape up in their own
conferences i will add some remarks on
the comparative strengths of the various
leagues so that you can form a national
ranking list if you want to since most
teams do not wander far from their home
pastures such a list however is not par-
ticularly significant

new york city teams

lets take the new york city area
first not that its the best-for it
certainly didnt shine overly much in in-
tersectional competition last season-but
because the teams of the nations metrop-
olis will meet the finest representatives
of all sections of the country and thus give
us the best standard of evaluation of na-
tional strength

  the general impression is that new york
will be represented by some of the finest
quintets it has had in some time long
island university ford ham new york
university and city college are all expect-
ing banner seasons manhattan brooklyn
and st john are either destitute of vete-
rans or have not enough all-around
strength to be potent court powers this
year

  long island university shared the met-
ropolitan championship with fordhami
last season and was generally regarded as
one of the finest teams in the east the
blackbirds have lost four outstanding
players but the replacements from -the
freshman squad are nothing short of sen-
sational hillhouse torgoff and sewitch
are the veterans remaining but theyll have
to fight some to keep king kaplowitz
newman and bromberg from starting
posts any combination of these players
has an average height of over  feet 
inches torgoff is one of the shrewdest
players in the east and the ex-freshmen
are all dead-eyes the squad which will
be this years liu varsity went to den-
ver for the aau championships last
season and reached the quarter-final round
where they were eliminated by the denver
safeways the team which eventually won
the national championship the black-

birds lost to stanford last season and will
be out for gore when they meet the indians
in the garden this year

   new york university expects to be on
 the heights again after a mediocre season
 the violets will be represented by a team
 which was outstanding as a freshmen
 quintet three years ago carnevale tar-
 low boardman and witty are the seniors
 who are expected to start and lewis a
 brilliant sophomore should be able to break
 into the starting five

    city college will have a veteran outfit
 which started out like a rocket and fizzled
 as the season waned the beavers are
 still a slick ball-handling outfit and with
 the non-jump rule and added experience
 in their favor should compile an impres-
 sive record fliegel katz goldstein
 cohen jarmulnick lefkowitz and sou-
 pios will see action most frequently city
 meets stanford in the garden two nights
 before liu does and the players are
 rather optimistic over the outcome i
 would like to see a little more of both teams
 before changing my opinion as to which is
 the best in the country

   fordham surprise co-winner of the
 metropolitan championship will have
 davis daley and hasmiller back these
 men play a deliberate game which makes
 their great speed all the more effective
 when they use it however i think the
 rams will miss drury the hub of their
 attack and defense and will not be able
 to repeat their success

    st johns has a junior team with the ex-

	ception of bush its senior star i do not
 believe that they will better their record
 by much as they are still too inexperienced
 manhattan lost all of its regulars but
 volpe and cole their reserves and soph-
 omores are not too impressive and i think
 that coach neil cohalan will spend this
 year rebuilding for the next compaign
 brooklyn and st francis just havent the
 material to do more than make it close for
 the big six

 the east

 brief survey of the eastern intercol-
 legiate league indicates a close fight
 between pennsylvania the defending
 champion and columbia yale harvard
 and dartmouth should be close but i like
	basketball stories

columbias chances best wolff obrien
anderson and macioce are all back and
they were good enough to tie for third last
season pennsylvania will be led by men-
zel and he should receive enough support
from a squad well supplied by veterans to
keep the team near the top at yale and
harvard ken loeffler and wes fess-
ler respectively are gradually getting
their players accustomed to their styles of
play both are dark horses and may come
through in what should be an exciting race
as usual the caliber of play in the ivy
league will be high in spirit and short in
finesse because each schools rivalry with
the others is an ancient one

  in the eastern intercollegiate confer-
ence it looks as though pittsburg title-
holder temple which was defeated in a
play-off for the championship and george-
town which finished fifth last year will be
at it neck and neck pitt has plenty of re-
serve strength losing only one or two men
and temple led by mike bloom has lost
only jeunger but the hoyas will have the
sensational murphey back and hell be sup-
ported by six veterans including petroskey
bilbeau and nolan only bassin has been
lost and coach mesmers boys have a good
chance to end up on top other powerful
teams in this section of the country in-
clude duquesne and st joseph

the south

traveling to the southeastern
conference we find that playing
strength was better distributed there last
season than has been the case in the past
i doubt that georgia tech will retain the
title it won last year despite the fact that
it has three regulars returning and is plen-
tifully supplied with reserves kentucky
which loses donahue and carlisle has
hodge hagin curtis walker thompson
and opper returning and should go places
of these only hagin and walker are se-
niors and the additional experience of last
years sophomores should count heavily

  tennessee is also plentifully supplied
with talented material and should be near
the top in the final standings the vols
who lost only to kentucky in last years
conference battle lost marshall and john-
son but rice putnam westercamp lo-
gan and fisher will all be back louisi-

ana state tulane vanderbilt and georgia
should also improve their standings the
green wave has pare harmon cotlar
and neyland returning while the commo-
dores the tigers and the bulldogs will
rely on veterans to revive their prestige

the west

moving up to the western intercol-
legiate conference or big ten as it
is usually called we find the expectation
of the closest race in years

  illinois which tied minnesota for the
championship last year will have to re-
place combes henry and reigels if bou-
dreau and nisbet are to be on another
championship team and i doubt if coach
mills has the material minnesota is in
better shape for the coming season losing
only seeback dave mcmillan will bring
his boys to the garden this year and his
team should be an excellent representative
of the fine style of play in this conference
kundla addington rolek and manley will
all be back to form the nucleus of a good
defensive team which relies on smart ball
handling on the attack

  purdue should be close to the top this
year with a fine veteran team returning
seward and downey will be gone but
young sines anderson and a host of
others are back to give coach lambert an-
other successful season as usual the
boilermakers will feature the fast break
which they use with dazzling speed in
addition sines anderson and young the
conferences high scorer are all excellent
shots when the opposition is playing back
for-the fast break ohio has macdonald
baudebaugh hull and baker returning
and should be an important factor in the
race although dye and thomas will un-
doubtedly be missed

  michigan should be near the top next
march the wolverines have been im-
proving gradually and employ a slow break
offense and depend on size and exceptional
ability to control the rebounds off the back-
boards rather than on speed thomas and
townsend amongst the tallest men in the
big ten will lead a veteran squad indi-
ana which is still rebuilding and north-
western which closed strongly at the end
of the race are both dark horses wis-
consin chicago and iowa are expected to
the court parade of 	

remain in the second division summariz-
ing id say that the title will be decided
among minnesota purdue michigan and
indium with ohio state illinois and
northwestern close behind

the midlands

skipping over to the big six we find
co-champion kansas trying to carry
on after having lost five men-all of them
stars-and will have a difficult time this
year to continue its perennial supremacy
in the conference iowa state after two
years near the cellar should be close to the
top this season having a veteran array
in general all schools in the big six are
either well supplied with veterans or had
strong freshman teams last year there-
fore a dogfight is expected with nebraska
and iowa state near the head of the list

the southwest

taking a flying trip over to the
southwest conference we find that
southern methodist arkansas and texas
shape up as the class of that section of the
country southern methodist university
which took top honors last year should be
given the edge having lost only blanton
with dewell norton sprague and acker
returning and with reinforcements from
a strong freshman squad the mustangs
should be able to hold off the perennially
dangerous arkansas quintet which is also
well stocked with veterans

  texas which is slated to get three bril-
liant newcomers from the john tarleton
junior college championship team still has
a chance to cop the honors

the rockies

following the rockies northward
we come to one of the least recognized
but finest playing leagues in the nation-
the rocky mountain conference this
year it will be split into the big seven
and the little five

  colorado u nvuersity with schwartz
white and sidwell returning is expected to
take honors in the big seven with utah
university which has mulica pendle-
ton and ahlquist coming back close

behind wyoming which will rely on
hicks winterholler and young will prob-
ably be a potent factor in deciding the
championship

  in the little five montana state which
finished on top in the western division
and then won the conference champion-
ship in the play-offs last year again is ex-
pected to triumph the grizzlies will be
led by exum and ogle both of whom
made the all-conference team last season
greely with hallinan and cromer back
should give montana a battle all the way

the coast

jumping over the rockies which is
not a bad trick if you go in for that
sort of stuff we arrive at the west coast
right where we started as i stated pre-
viously i believe that stanford will again
come through for the conference crown
in the northern division washington
state with a veteran squad and oregon
a veteran group led by silver  foot -inch
center should fight it out for the right to
meet the winner of the southern division
in the southern part of the conference
there should be a dogfight among southern
california california and ucla-for
second place of course anything can
happen but thats the way it looks now

  this is one of the toughest leagues in
the nation and even though stanford
seems a standout at this time the rest of
the group is too well coached to let any
one team run away with it this was evi-
denced by the way stanford which steam-
rollered all outside opposition last year
dropped a game each to sam barrys
university of southern california squad
and to nibs prices california quintet and
barely squeezed through against wash-
ington state for the coast championship

  in this survey ive left out a number of
outstanding teams and conferences-not
because they werent of importance but
rather becayse of the limitations of space

  well there it is-the big forecast of
 dont bet your last red cent on these
predictions-men are mortal-even hoop
critics with long white beards one fact
is as sure as the referees whistle-
will be a prime season for the nations bas-
ket-bombardiers
the basket busters



 by harold m sherman

you should have been on the coast-to-
coast barnstormin trip that the all-
american ramblers took in quest of
the national professional basketball title a
few years back believe me brother that
was a trip as wearin on mens nerves as it
was on rubber soled shoes

  no i didnt play myself all i did was
to manage the team and see that it was
dated up ahead like a circus and take up all
the money that was offered on the home
hopes and keep the boys feelin sociable
toward one another if any of you birds
think i had it soft you can put me in charge
of a beehive and give each bee a separate
grudge against me and ill come up smilin
if i dont look natural

  to make matters as bad as they could
be without bein worse i was the guy who
originated the bright idee of takin a basket-
ball team on a cross-country hike this
made me about as popular with the bunch
after what happened as a republican siftin
in on the democratic convention

  you see it was me that organized the
first round-the-world baseball club and i
picked up so much dough with this outfit i
didnt see why the same couldnt be did in
basketball well i can see now with both
eyes shut a baseball diamonds a baseball
diamond but a basketball floor aint always
a basketball floor for instance one night
we might be forced to play in a dance hall
with the floor waxed so slick that the boys
needed bumpers on the place they usually
sat  and the next night wed be trottin
onto a concrete floor so hard you could
smell burnt rubber when the game started
and if any of the boys took a tumble it was
generally good for a bottle of arnica of
course the home team was all prepared to
meet these local conditions which gave them
the tip-off at the very start even though
most of em did play like a bunch of hams

  as far as the team was concerned if you
could have found seven better basketball
players in the united states this side of
canada at that time id have bought you
the best clam dinner in the state of indi-
gestion everyone of them boys was born
dont stare at my gray hairs broiler i came by em honest yeah
i managed the ramblers classiest troupe of cassaba-tossers in the
world what wrecked em-brother why spoil my day

a complete novel of

barnstorming basketeers

with basketball eyes the eyes had rings
around em they were hand-picked speci-
mens of physical prowess and with the ex-
ception of one player i wouldnt have split
one of the white hairs i grew on that trip
between any of em

  but loop harris to my mind was the
worlds champion rifleman of basketball
sharp-shootin he could hit that old iron
ring from any place on the floor and about
any time he got his hands on the ball he
wasnt nothin to look at and about all you
saw at first glance was elbows and knees
then gradually you could tell that he was
squint-eyed and that one side of his jaw
was longer than the other like hed laid his
face between the jaws of a vise loop had
sandy hair and a disposition as sultry as
 degrees in the shade with no breeze
blowin when it came to pitchin free
throws from the foul line he would cock his
head to one side stick his elbows in under
his knees bend down till his knees came up
even with his chin and all you ever saw was
the net wave  so clean did he cut the rim
loop was our ace in the hole and the big
point scorer in every game we played it
didnt make no difference what defense the
opposition put up-they couldnt stop him
we used to advertise ahead of the game
invitin the home folks to see loop loop
em and he always came through some-
times with the entire team standin over
him like a detachment of the national
guard

  we was on our way through kentucky
leavin a trail of dead and wounded bones
behind us when i gets the special delivery
challenge that was to mark a turnin point
in my illustrated career-not to mention the
travelin troupe with me

  the letter bore a postage stamp licked by
the manager of the northern stars a team
which had been writin its name on the
heavens up in northern michigan the
name of the town where this outfit boarded
and roomed was tough mountain but i
told the boys it looked like easy climbin to


	basketball stories

me we was booked for two games in
michigan one with the detroit rails and
the other with the grand rapids furniture
quintet and why not hit the dog trail for
the arctic part of michigan when there was
one thousand berries in it for us and per-
haps a lot more on lumberjack side bets 

  youll find we pack a neat little wallop
the challenge went on to state in grade-a
grammar and the towns behind us 
per cent we know were situated in an
out-of-the-way place and thats why were
offering you a thousand-dollar guarantee
its worth that much to beat you please
sign the enclosed contract and oblige
yours pat sullivan mgr the northern
stars-the team thats never tasted
defeat 

  whew they loves themselves dont
they says loop harris when he hears the
letter if theres one thing this here
john doe likes to do its waterlooing home
hopes theres one place where ill have
to trot out my sample case of baskets and
decorate the hall

  this letter never affected us none we
was used to such bunk the louder they
crowed the harder they fell-with us and
it was the little who-are-you teams that
was always makin the most noise

  i signed the contract and shipped it back
to tough mountain markin the date in my
date book and then forgettin all about the
game until we was ready to shove off from
grand rapids after breakin the furniture
quintet up into kindling wood

it was the heavy underwear time of
year-the latter part of january with
the thermometer reading  degrees below
zero none of the boys was complainin
about the heat except loop who said it
wasnt warm enough in his hotel room
the snow was four feet deep on the level
and the weather bureau giving out lots of
encouragement about another blizzard over-
due    and uu at the depot startin out
to meet it

  this basketball tour is gettin pleasanter
and pleasanter says eddie jordan big-
nosed back guard who was nursin a
grouch from bein scored on by accident
for the first time in ten games why
didnt you go south in the winter and north

in summer

  because basketball aint a hot weather

game i answers rather short studying
my time-table and tryin to figure out
where on the map of michigan this tough
mountain is

  well you aint exactly seen the eski-
mos play it has you  eddie asks me
while the other boys applaud

  you wait till you play the northern
stars says i finally locatin tough moun-
tain with my finger were goin so far
into northern michigan youll think youre
in iceland itll take us two days to get
there connectin with every train that con-
nects    barrin snowstorms and glaciers
were booked to play tomorrow night and
if we have good luck we ought to get
there in time to dress on the floor

  from the groans that went up i could
tell that the boys was getting mighty sick
of boundn around over jerk-water rail-
roads and sleepin sittin up for lack of
pullmans wed been out five weeks and
was lookin back on an unbroken string
of victories we had the goods all right
and we sure had distributed em along
the way but it was a wonder we wasnt
carryin a team of broken legs wrists el-
bows noses and other protrudin or ob-
trusive parts of the human anatomy all
the boys was pretty much stuck up with
court plaster and adhesive tape but they
was sputtering along on all cylinders and
i intended to keep em there until the
tour was over and then go into some quiet
business like a stationery salesman and
never take another trip as long as i lived

  in baseball about the worst that could
happen was for the pitchers arm to go
sore or a player to get a charley horse or
for some bird to get beaned anything
else seldom happened but in basketball
you was worryin all the time for fear
the china dolls with pink knees would turn
an ankle or do a high dive or bump heads
there was a thousand things that might
happen and with money up on the game
every second of play was hard on the pulse

  well the boys couldnt do anything but
crawl on the train since i didnt have tick-
ets for any summer resort and the next
thing we know were plowing through the
snow flurries the tickets was about a
yard long with four pretty perforated sec-
tions and the first one labeled walton
junction

  whats the mileage menu subdivided
the basket busters	

for loop asks me curious like sos
the conductor can go on a tear

  i	didnt think his question was worth
answerin since hed find out soon enough
there wasnt enough passengers on the
train to attend an afternoon tea the
windows was frosted over but no one
wanted to see where we was goin just
so we kept on goin there

there was a forty-mile gale blowin
by five oclock in the afternoon when
the g r  i train skated into walton
junction wheezing snow and hangin
icicles

  all out for walton junk-shun   
an all points north hollers the conductor
as he puts on his fur overcoat and gets
ready to corral his train in the round-
house

  the boys tumble out in the aisle like
a flock of mountain sheep and slide off the
rear platform into two feet of new-laid
snow they take in the frozen landscape
with open mouths and brace themselves
against the wind

  sufferin codfish says loop this
looks like pearys last stop before his dash
to the pole

  all there was in sight was two frame
buildins a grocery store and what for
want of websters providin us with an
appropriate name must be classified as a
hotel it was a frame front with a ver-
anda stickin out like a sore tooth   
one of them places where you couldnt
buy a clean towel where they served you
ice water in a cracked pitcher for shavin
where the landlord and family lived and
where a hand-painted sign hung in the
combination parlor and lobby sayin
home sweet home we want you to
feel the same way or somethin to that
effect

  but websters hotel was twice as good
as nothin and we troops in stampin snow
all over the floor and makin a fuss gen-
erally so as to let em know we was stran-
gers we really didnt need to make so
much noise because a cowbell tinkles just
over the door as she opens

  aint that cute chortles eddie jor-
dan openin and shuttin the door several
times

  cut out that stockyard stuff crabs
loop ugly as a mexican bull fighter and

  shut that door before we gets buried in a

snowdrift

  just as we was gettin ready to toss the
ball up between the two of em and let
em fight it out there is the heavy squeak
of shoes and in pops the landlord big as
life-which in his case was about two
hundred and forty pounds minus a big
bowl pipe his head was bald except for
a wavy fringe around the edge it looked
hard and cold like a skating rink but the
ice thawed a little when he smiled

  hello boys sign here he says dig-
gin a greasy book from under the coun-
ter and jabbin a broken-pointed pen to-
ward me

  we dont intend to stay thank
you speaks up loop informal like we
just come in to get out of the storm and
to wait between trains

  the landlord gives loop the once over
like hed committed a foul

  goin north or south he asks
aint there any east or west babbles
loop like he was disappointed not to have
a wider choice

  not in this country snaps the land-
lord losin his smile if youre goin
north the next trains due at four in the
morning but if shes here inside of two
hours after shes due ill give you your
lodgin free

  loop turns to the team glummer than
glum

  believe me boys were up against an
air-tight defense he says no chance
to break through bout the only thing
we can do is stall for time

  well we scribbles our john henrys on
the book the landlord not lettin me sign
for the bunch then we spreads out
around the room to wait until the land-
lords wife finds parkin space for us all

i	steps over to the dirty bay window that
has a long box of wilted ferns settin on
the sill    and peeks out at where the
railroad track ought to be if it wasnt for
the snow the blizzard is blizzarding
by mornin it looks like we wouldnt be
able to get across to the grocery store
which means slow death by starvation
eddie jordan sidles up alongside me and
sniffs at the ferns wouldnt this make
a swell reception room for an undertaker 
he asks but i cant give him no answer
except a mournful look
	basketball stories

the landlord comes downstairs with
a load of water pitchers and stops to
be sociable we was the only clients and

i	guess maybe he didnt know he had us
like flies on sticky fly paper we swaps
scowls for grins at the start but pretty
soon the landlord shoots the ball at us
straight

  i see youre a basketball team says
he leavin room for argument

  collectively and individually says i
leavin no room for doubt

  the landlord sets the water pitchers
down on the counter and lamps us all
over like he was judge at a stock show
then he shakes his head sad and sober

  boys you dont know what youre
a-comin to he says

  no-but we knows what weve arrived
at loops loop sarcastically

  i	speaks up right away in a reprimandin
tone

  wait a minute loop maybe this here
   ah   mr webster    has some
dope on the boys were booked to play

  howd you know my name was web-
ster speaks up the landlord surprised
like

  why    er    well  by con-
sultin the dictionary i answers vague
enough to keep him wonderin i dont
usually guess em as straight as that

  by the time youve got through with
the northern stars youll be consultin a
encyclopedia advises mr webster while
the boys give one another the wink

  whats so strange about the northern
stars asks eddie jordan aint they
human 

  not when theys playin basketball
chirps our landlord theys like michi-
gan wildcats

  they must be pretty good agrees
loop dubiously i aint never heard of
em

  no they aint given to talkin much
-and they aint gone out beyond their
own precinct before but there aint five
men anywhere what can beat them on their
own floor

  heres where the landlord begins to get
unpopular

  if so why so queries loop follow-
in up

  but the landlord takes on a wise air
and starts to pick up his water pitchers

  thats for you boys to find out he
answers short and sweet

  cant you tell us one thing persists
loop how come you know so much
about these terrible terrors

  mr webster turns his whole front our
way

  you dont think i could make a livin
out of this place alone do you  he throws
at us im one of the team backers
we couldnt have been more tooken off
our feet than if santa claus had suddenly
busted in the door the landlord a basket-
ball nut putting up good dough on the
games    and makin money at it 
sufferin free throws

  the boys all reaches for their pocket-
books at the same time showin how much
confidence they has in themselves but
the landlord waves them to the sidelines
with a water pitcher

  nothin stirrin boys i places my
money through the tough mountain syn-
dicate if you want any of it youll have
to put up your coin there

  highly civilized id call that it give
me the first tremors id ever had things
begun to look nigh unto rotten in den-
mark    but i didnt say anythin

  what do you know about basketball
anyhow  asks eddie as the landlord starts
toward the kitchen

i dont know nothin about the game
he answers honest like but you cant
trip me up  any of the business angles
meanin what i asks curious
winners end guarantee he lets slide
as he fades out of the picture

  right then is when the all-american
rambler basketball team and their business
manager holds a conference from what
the landlord has said without makin no
bones about it we was cut and dried for
the nicest and boldest little frame-up of
our ball some careers

ill

wed played for money placin bets
on ourselves-but wed played
square bein satisfied with an even break

  of course wed met up with raw deals
and been gypped here and there but wed
come through so far with the clothes on
our backs and our bill folds well lined
wed been content to let the other fellows
the basket busters	

worry about us and we didnt give a razz-
berry for the imposiri records of the op-
posin teams we just went out and did
our stuff unconcerned like and the op-
position usually cracked

  but now we was all-fired interested in
gettin the advance dope on the northern
stars not wantin to get froze out if we
could help it

  what sort of a surprise package do
you reckon them northern stars has got
for us asks eddie while the rest of the
boys comes in on the chorus

  its beyond my mental capacity says
i but you can bet a couple of half-soled
snow shoes that im goin to be on my
guard when we hits tough mountain and
the first sneakin suspicion i gets of any
crooked business  i calls the game
off

  atta boy mgr sings loop afore-
said bein my nickname for manager i
aint hankerin to have to leave this cli-
mate on a dog sled

  evidently them northern pussy cats is
nursin the idee that they is slick ones i
guesses and they figures on makin a
cleanin at our expense now if we minds
our ps and qs and ws  i got a
hunch we stands to rake in some cold coin

  cold is right agrees eddie shiverin
as the wind howls against the window

  just then mrs webster comes in she
is a long-drawn-out lady with a nose start-
in high on her forehead and runnin down
sos it leans over her mouth like an over-
hangin cliff she gives us a bow and
when she opens her mouth to talk the
sounds come out her nose like the loud
speaker on a radio

  follow me gentlemen she pipes
startin up the stairs

  not any farthern i can help sniffs
jim codfry the sheik of our crowd but
we single-files it up the steps trippin over
the holes in the carpet    until we finds
ourselves in a dark hall feelin about like
we was it in blindmans bluff

  i can only accommodate seven of you
boys informs the landlords other half
ive only got three double beds and a
cot    but i can sleep the number eight
with some blankets on the floor

  this sounds so encouragin that i speaks
right up

  number eight is me lady i never

sleeps in any strange beds unless i have

to

  the boys sets up a howl but i silence
them with you birds have to play and
i dont if theres any layin on pine knots
to be did im the one whats elected to
do itt

  mrs webster rattles the door knobs and
distributes the eight of us in three rooms
that is luxuriously outfitted with second-
hand furniture none of the bedsteads
matches the dressers and the wall paper
yells bloody murder but we aint goin to
take up no permanent residence in the
place so we tries to imagine we is put up
at the waldorf-astoria and settles down
to makin ourselves as comfortable as pos-
sible

  after supper which consists of a pot
roast of beans with a sprinklin of pork
and some bread which comes all the way
from the furniture city judgin by the
piece of wood there was in mine we re-
pairs to our sleepin quarters sos we could
retire early    bein as how we was
due to turn out anywhere after four to
catch the snowland limited

  the boys was a little bit irritated so i
dont make no attempt to tell them any
bedtime stories i find im scheduled to
snore on the floor beside the four-poster
what is to hold eddie and loop three
other boys is campin in the room next
door and right across the hall is the other
two

  it aint so very long before i can hear
the all-american ramblers givin old man
insomnia a terrible beatin    but for
some reason i cant run into any sand-
bags just layin like a rug on the floor
starin up at the ceilin pop-eyed

i guess three hours must have ticked
away when i noticed that eddie and
loop are movin about restless like in their
sleep i think they are havin bad dreams
or maybe the bed aint very comfortable
but as long as they dont know nothin
about it i figures they is more blissful
than i am

  but all of a sudden loop who is on
the outside flops over and sits up he
looks around the room sort of dazed bends
an elbow over his back and scratches a
place between his shoulder blades then
he begins to wake up and bets busy with
	basketball stories

the other hand rubbin his stomach region
gingerly his hands begin to fly so fast
that it looks like he is exercisin to keep
warm and i decide hes got chilled as the
room is cold with the wind and snow blow-
in against the window

  pretty soon loop looks down and sees
me rubberin up at him he dont say
anythin for a minute just sits there star-
in at me and scratchin finally he sticks
a knee out from under the covers and puts
his foot on the floor pullin himself out
of bed he tiptoes over to the lamp and
fights with a match to light the wick then
he begins to examine himself like a newly-
elected member of the aef lookin for
cooties

  gosh almighty i hears him say as
he looks inside the front of his pajamas

  i throws the blankets off and gets out
in the chilly air cornin over to him

  whats ailin you i asks tryin to
figure out the chinese puzzle

  thats what i want to know snarls
loop you dont reckon i got into any
poison ivy somewheres do you

  i gives him a scornful look

  no chance says i the only bou-
quets what this country has in the winter
time is clusters of icicles

  i feel like i was all broke out with
the prickly heat moans loop give me
the once over will you  maybe im cornin
down with a compilation of diseases

  i moves loop up close to the lamp and
makes a survey of his anatomy honest
i am stunned at what i see his body
is covered with white puffy welts it
looks like an army of mosquitoes has laid
down a barrage on him followed by a
bumblebee bombardment reinforced with
a counter attack of the hives and all the
time loop is groanin and cussin and
scratchin

  maybe its somethin i ate loop diag-
noses mournfully

  no    its somethin what tried to
eat you i corrects steppin over to the
bed and throwin back the covers quick

  just as i thought    three reddish-
brown rascals gallops across the sheet try-
in to get out of sight

  what in the name of forked lightnin
is them things asks loop reachin for
a place farther down on his back

  innocence abroad says i thems the

grandparents of a thrifty crop of bedbugs
and youre related to their bites

a look of disappointment comes over
loops face he dives for his grip
and throws his clothes out on the floor
and comes up with a funny sort of ap-
paratus that looks like the cross between
a pistol and a scotchmans bagpipe

  and just to think he says that i
carries this insect powder two thousand
miles to have them little devils sneak up
on me in the dark

  eddie is still sleepin but makin a bad
job of it what with his twistin and turn-
in before i can figure whats up loop
jumps on the bed and begins to move the
handles of the rig-a-ma-jig up and down
the bellows attachment starts to snort and
pretty soon the gun part spits out yellow
dust which shoots all over the sheet and
clouds up the atmosphere

  i	backs away coughin while loop goes
after the bed like the delousin department
of an agricultural college chasin tent cater-
pillars

  poor eddie gets a full blast of the pow-
der in the most exposed portion of his
face which is his mouth he lets out a
sneeze which just about blows the rest of
the covers off the bed and sits up chokin
and wheezin like he had both lungs full
of asthma

  loop pays no attention to eddie hes
a hundred and twenty degrees hot and the
only idee he has is to exterminate every-
thin that lives

  eddie cant imagine whats what but he
has presence enough of gray matter to
tumble out of bed and yell fire so
loud that its a wonder the icicles didnt
drop off the house

  shut up you animated cartoon growls
loop this is a extinguisher but she
dont work on fires were burnin up
with bugs

  eddie begins to take inventory bein
wide awake now and lookin like a man
in the last throes of hay fever i sizes
him up too and offers my sympathy right
quick when i sees the condition hes in

  great blisterin hot dogs exclaims ed-
die his eyes bulgin im as full of bites
as a picnic grounds

  and then he begins to scratch startin
in on his legs and workin up systematic
the basket busters	

  it aint long before theres a knock on
the door and jim cod fry busts in from
across the hall the shiek wouldnt have
made no hit with the girls then one eye
is bloated shut and he looks like he has
a dislocated jaw

  greetins says i as loop stops fumi-
gatin the bed and turns around to see
whos who

  greetins yourself blasts jim in a
ugly humor is that all you got to say
to a guy whats been most et up by bed-
bugs 

  loop and eddie give jim the cold stare

  youre not the only bill of fare on the
menu shoots loop look at us

  then theother boys troop into the room
crowdin around us and each one claimin
to have the most bites it sounds like a
bunch of fishermen    only it dont
  you can show these kind of bites
to prove youve got em where all a fish-
erman can show for his bites is his word
which dont count for nothin in his own
country

  well eddie finally wins first premium
over loop by two whoppin lumps with
the other members of the all-american
ramblers trailin in the near vicinity its

	am by this time and no one showin
any further desire to enter the unconscious
state so we decides to dress and sit
listenin to the snow flurries

as soon as we is clothed loop or-
ganizes a indignation meetin nomi-
natin eddie jordan temporary chairman
him bein the worst sufferer up to the
immediate present but loop aint so sure
but what some other lumps is goin to
show up on him yet which would crowd
eddie out of first place

  when the boys sees that i is the only
one not nursin any insect teeth marks
they is beside themselves with envy it
looks for a minute like they is goin to
initiate me into the royal order of the
also bitten by puttin me to bed and mak-
in me stay there until i qualifies for the
thirty-third degree

  i wondered why old mgr was so
bloomin anxious to sleep on the floor
unlimbers eddie its too bad there aint
man-eatin carpet bugs is his hide any
better than ourn

  i is downright sorry for the boys as i

knows by previous experience how stimu-
lated they feels

  youll never realize how much i re-
grets that the pleasure is all yours i
says with everythin but tears in my eyes

  the scratchin squad gives me a look as
full of gratitude as a cannon cracker is
full of talcum powder

  the purpose of this meetin is to de-
termine ways and means of collectin dam-
ages for this outrage announces eddie
ignorin my expression of sympathy this
is a time in the course of human events
when strong-arm methods is necessary to
get satisfaction

  by the cheers eddie gets youd think
he was runnin for congress the boys
is all for gettin even with the manage-
ment for throwin them to the bedbugs

  im just itchin to get revenge bellows
loop

  his sentiments is wildly echoed

  then i comes in with a suggestion which
restores my popularity

  look here boys theres only one way
to sting the owner of this house of mis-
ery thats by gettin at his pocketbook
if we can get him to go heavy on that
game tomorrow night  i mean to-
night    and lift all his money through
the tough mountain syndicate  i
guess that would be sweet revenge-eh
what 

  the boys looks at one another con-
templatin they is ho longer worried
about the northern stars the way they
feels now they can drub any two-legged
basketball team in the country regardless
of size reputation or complexion and
i knows it

  we is indebted to the mgr for a
valuable idee says eddie what shall
we do with it

  i makes a motion that we goes the
limit speaks up loop i guess heres
one time they dont pay brother webster
accordin to his winners end guarantee

  the motion is passed and i is authorized
to place all the money that the tough
mountain syndicate will take-and to be
sure to cover every dollar put up by the
corpulent backer of the northern stars

four oclock comes and goes but no
train does likewise we sits huddled
up in our room tryin to keep warm-but


basketball stories

we is ready to grab our things and jump
out into the snow the first time we hears
any noise like a locomotive

  at six-thirty there is a stir downstairs
and the sound of someone shakin the in-
side out of a coal burner we is over-
joyed at the prospects of a heat wave so
we goes below to borrow some of it

  try to picture how staggered we is when
we runs into the landlords wife in bed-
room slippers and a kimono with her hair
in a knot and the same nose rustlin ashes
out of the stove jim codfry speaks for
the bunch when he says pardon me mrs
webster we thought you was your hus-
band	
mrs webster gives us a look which
would have cut a loaf of dry bread in
two and snaps what do you boys mean
cornin downstairs before i calls you
well i aint no good at riddles but jim
is equal to the occasion

  why mrs webster he says apolo-
getic where i come from they always
calls me by rattlin down the stove-and
then i comes down and carries out the
ashes

  mrs webster breaks out with a smile
and hands her pail of ashes over to jim
while we all registers a state of helpless
willingness

  howd you boys sleep last night

  i knows this question would cause
trouble the minute she asks it the boys
dont none of them look natural or feel
natural and they is as cross as a billy goat
with nothin to butt against

  sleep ejaculates loop like he aint
familiar with the word sleep did you
say

  thats right young man warbles she
with the nose a state of what some peo-
ple calls suspended imitation

  you means suspended animation i
crossfires havin been a victim of this
disease most of my life

  there wasnt nothin suspended about
my animation last night blurts out loop
ill tell the whole scratchin world

  just then the husband of the landlordess
busts in on the dialogue he is in his
shirt sleeves and stockin feet and he has
a whats up expression on his face

  i told you the train would be two hours
late what you boys up so early for he
snorts

  eddie steps out from our bunch like a
talkin delegate and walks his bites over
in front of the proprietor

  yeah-now let me ask a couple he
says surly like you may have told us
a few things but theres one important
thing what you did not mention

  the price guesses the landlord beam-
in like a mint my rooms-

  are already taken finishes eddie
taken echoes his two hundred and
forty pounds as blank as a scoreless in-
ning

  thats the little descriptive word nar-
rates eddie inhabited if she suits you
better

  the boys all nod their heads while the
landlord makes eyes at his wife and she
blinks back

  talk walton junction says mr web-
ster after a while i dont get you  

  not for another night anyways as-
sures loop rubbin a lump in under his
collar to be perfectly frank and lucid
and all that    did you ever hear tell
of a animal that goes by the norn de plume
of bedbug

  the moment he uncorks this simple
question mrs webster gets as hot as the
poker to a fireless cooker

  why the very idee says she of men-
tionin such a thing as bedbugs in my
house theres not a single one here
youre right there maam agrees
eddie pointin to his exhibit a collection
of bites you havent got a single bed-
bug in the house theys all married and
have large families

  see here jumps in the landlord shak-
in his fist at eddie im not goin to
stand here and have my wife slandered
by a bunch of rowdies if you  

  now    now  i breaks in
theres no need of gettin up in the air
over this matter mr webster its been
a very disagreeable night and the less said
the better all we wants to know is the
size of our bill and the boys will try to
forget the size of their bites were leavin
you at the toot of the whistle which cant
come none too soon

  you may be leavin but youre not
leavin me shouts the landlord im
goin to tough mountain too

  the boys threw their eyes about from
one to the other and mrs webster glares
the basket busters



at her bigger half like his intentions was
news to her

  got to look after your business inter-
ests eh queries loop

  the landlord puffs up like a bloated
milkweed he circulates a crafty smile

  business interests is right im placin
another thousand with the tough moun-
tain syndicate want to give you boys
plenty to shoot at    and lots to holler
about

  thats mighty nice of you santa
claus says eddie were not much on
hollerin but when it comes to shootin at
anything were peppered bulls-eyes and
shattered clay pigeons

  just then there is a screech up the rail-
road track and the boys grab for their be-
longings like they was goin to answer a
fire alarm

  how much do we owe i asks flippin
out a roll of bills

  call her ten even he says shovin his
feet into some shoes i aint got time
to change nothin now

the snow blow special comes limpin
in so slow that you can hardly tell
when she really stops the trains been
layin in a drift most of the night and the
engineers darn near starved to say nothin
of froze so he ties his engine to a hitch-
in post and comes in to get a cup of
hot coffee which gives us time to dampen
our palates before we has to get on board

  so you boys is the basketball team what
plays the northern stars tonight-pro-
vidin you get to tough mountain so far
ahead of time asks the engineer between
gulps

  were the intended victims i says
glancin at mr webster who is dressed up
in his stiffest stiff collar and rarin to go

  well    its too bad they dont run
funeral trains on this road is the engi-
neers reply

  does we look like a flock of corpses
asks eddie stretchin a piece of bread
thats like slingshot rubber

  not just yet-but when the game is
over youll be laid out pretty soothes the
engineer gettin up from the table and
wipin his dripping mustache them
northern stars is murderous

  after this further encouragement we

-basketball stories-winter

troops on the train as happy as a bunch
of cattle en route to the stockyards

  say maybe tills team is tough muses
loop as we sits down inside the coach
and tries to scrape the frost off the win-
dows

  tough bedbugs i snorts and the boys
soon recovers their morale

  the trip to tough mountain aint worth
puttin down in almanac form we changes
cars three times and she snows so much
that if the trains we connected with hadnt
started out from the place where we con-
nected wed have never caught em but
it seems like those fool trains can eat snow
alive the way they crawls through the
drifts at that i thought there was sev-
eral times when wed have to take to snow-
shoes

  mr webster dont ride in the same car
with us which means that he rides in the
baggage compartment its just as well
because we wants to be alone with our-
selves and the remnants of our bites i
spends a good part of my time helpin
scratch the other boys every time mr
websters name is mentioned its like
throwin a bomb into a socialist meetin
they is gettin to love him more by the
minute

  and the first thing they asks for when
they arrives is where to find the tough
mountain syndicate

  we gets into tough mountain so late
that we dont have no time to do nothin
except rush for the basketball hall where
the games to be played just as i pre-
dicted pat sullivan manager of the
northern stars is at the depot and ware-
house to meet us hes a heavy-set little
fellow with a smooth face and shifty eyes
he tells me hes a graduate of irontown
college and he looks like hes a piece of
mined ore

  excuse the vacant streets he apolo-
gizes the whole towns at the hall waitin
to see the game

  we takes a couple of hacks on runners
and plows through the snow peerin out
the funny windows at the low wooden
buildinsand the crooked streets

  the syndicates got an office at the
hall says the manager answerin our in-
quiry

  youre quite a sportin town says
i by way of compliment


basketball stories

  were just good spenders he dodges
we like to play with money

  anything much up on this game i
questions

  oh about ten thousand he murmurs
offhand

  whos the takers comes in eddie

  well-we got a nice little bunch from
the detroit rails and the grand rapids
furniture today    bettin two to one
youd take us over the teams weve
trimmed are hankerin to get their money
back

  evidently you boys plays to win i
queries

  thats what every good team does
says the manager thats why were not
afraid to show the color of our money

  pretty soon the hacks draw up in front
of a high frame buildin and the driver
yells all out we jumps into the snow
and wades up the steps but we cant get
in the door on account of the crowd the
manager puts the boys through a window
into a private room where they can dress
and then he takes me around to the syn-
dicate office so i can place what money
i want and make other financial arrange-
ments

v

im so busy the next few minutes i dont
know whats goin on around me i
have four thousand dollars lurkin around
itchin to double itself and i run into mr
webster talkin confidential to the bird
whos in charge of the syndicate the
manager introduces me and i salts down
my money at even terms after some ar-
gument i absorbs all of mr websters
dough except the thousand hes brought
down with him and im so anxious to get
it all that i signs an i o u for the thou-
sand thats guaranteed us for the game
might as well clean up altogether while
im about it

  better stick around and see the game
i invites mr webster as he turns up his
coat collar

  im goin to stick around he says
but j-ust to collect the money

  the bird in charge of the syndicate
laughs and slips the money in a drawer
under the window

  i goes out of the office and into the hall
whew its like steppin from early fall

into midwinter the hall is packed to the
ceilin with tough mountaineers and
they eyes me like i was a hostile foreigner
i has all i can do elbowin my way through
the mob to get a look at the floor

  the hall is so hot that the perspiration
oozes out on me i can almost see the
heat waves in the air there is four big
railroad stoves with their iron bellies red
hot radiatin temperature i dont see how
any human can stand it but everybody but
me seems comfortable when i steps out
on the floor the crowd breaks out with a
round of cordial hisses which the manager
assures me aint intended for nothin per-
sonal    its just their natural way of
greetin i returns the greetin with a bow
showin every tooth i can and gets a pleas-
ant little encore that makes me feel as much
at home as a travelin man i has a vision
of bein inside the crater of an active vol-
cano-and no chance to get out before she
erupts

  but i aint told you about the floor shes
so small that i actually feels crowded stand-
in on it with the manager and not
twelve feet above the floor theres a string
of cross beams which gives you the sen-
sation of bein inside a cage my heart
does a flip-flop when i pictures how hand-
cuffed loops goin to be as theres no
chance for any long shots the same bein
his specialty the only way to make a
basket i figures is to get the ball right
up to it and pop it in from underneath the
rim

  whats the idea of the overhead fancy-
work i asks the manager

  well ill tell you he explains so
quick that i can tell hes used to answerin
this question the man who built this
hall originally intended to make it two
stories high he put in the beams but
he never laid the upstairs floor

  and it just never occurred to you to
take the beams down when you started
playin basketball eh  i asks pointed like

  the graduate of irontown college gives
me a contemptuous glance

  beams dont interfere with our playin
he shoots weve got a real team  what
dya mean kickin about the floor

well theys no use tryin to answer
that cross-word puzzle so i instructs
the manager to take me to the dressin
the basket busters



room where i could see the boys the
crowd is gettin so impatient that their
hisses sounds like a locomotive engine let-
tin off steam

  bring on your all-american dumb-
bells yells one tough mountain enthu-
siast we wants some exercise

  i lends this bird a deaf ear and crashes
into the dressin room where i finds the
boys in various states of discommode the
dressin room like every place else is so
small that they all cant dress at once with-
out gettin their legs in each others trunks
and gougin one another in the ribs

  did you get all the money placed
the boys asks me eagerly

  i nods my head not darin to trust my
voice but they senses that theres some-
thin missin in my home-brew prescrip-
tion

  whats up queries loop

  wait till you see where youre goin to
play i replies its just about large
enough for a wrestlin match-and if i
dont miss my guess thats what this games
goin to be

  have you seen the northern stars
yet asks eddie cussin as he breaks a
shoe lace

  no-theys still in their little igloos i
answers fayin to chirp up the party

  loop comes over to me consolin like

  now dont you worry mgr he
says pattin me on the back we could
play inside a sardine can tonight and make
the fish look poor theys nothin goin
to beat us the way we feel unless they takes
down the baskets and hides em where we
cant find em

  just then theres the worst racket that
ever busted in on my eardrums it sounds
like the general public howlin over the
income tax publicity and betwixt and
between you can hear the thump of a ball
and the pound of feet which shakes the
buildin the boys looks at one another
their faces full of significance

  wow theys fairly hostile over their
local talent aint they chortles jim cod-
fry

  hostile theys like a pack of man-
eatin sharks chasm a dead race horse
i elucidates but by the total number
of bedbug bites dont take this bunch too
lightly ive signed an i o u for the
thousand sinkers were guaranteed and if

we lose well have to take out citizenship
papers here

  what the bunch hollers and just as
they is goin to annihilate me theres a
bangin on the door the manager sticks
his head in

  ready

  theres about ten seconds of hesitation
and talkin with fingers and eyebrows the
roar from outside grows until it sounds
like a battery of coast-defense guns

  youd better hurry boys-were a half
hour late now advises the manager with
a wise smile and it dont pay not bein
punctual in this town

  not so fast i intercedes youre
not goin to rush us off our feet i wants
to meet the guy whos goin to referee this
bout and i also wants to see the time-
keepers

  with pleasure beams the manager
then he waits a second and follows up
with well how do you do

  i stares at him with my face entirely
unoccupied

  i dont believe i quite get you i says
cautious like

  im the referee he answers short and
sweet

  the boys draws in their breaths and
their eyes bulge

  well    im not exactly glad to
meet you i manages to snort not offerin
to shake hands trot out your time-
keepers and lets see how partial they
look

  anythin to oblige chuckles the man-
ager politely whistlin between his teeth
but make it snappy brothers because as
i said before 

  the manager doesnt have time to finish
when in comes    who do you think
   well shiver my vertebrae if it isnt
the life-sized walkin portrait of the bird
whos in charge of the tough mountain
syndicate and that aint all-his sec-
ond-hand partner in time-keepin is a fel-
low all decked out in basketball regalia
one of the northern star substitutes

iv

utttiat appears to be the row in-
vv quires the runner of the tough
mountain syndicate innocent like

  no row at all puts in the manager
	basketball stories

mr goldenrod here just wanted to set
his lamps on you guys before the game
started

  yes says i and i wants to keep
my lamps on em while the games goin
on too

  but loop is jabbin me in the ribs and
givin me the call-it-off signal im try-
in to think of a slick way oto but all i
can think of is a silly tune whatll i
do which keeps gallopin through my
brain cells a mile a minute seein that
i appears paralyzed loop invites the bunch
to follow his example and starts to strip
off his shirt reachin for his street clothes
the manager lays a hand on loops arm
and his voice freezes up

  i dont think id do that he says
meaningly it might not be healthy

  outside the crowd starts stamping their
feet which sounds like a foundry six
months behind in orders the boys look
to me just as if im a dealer in life pre-
servers    but theres nothin i can do

  give us thirty seconds alone and well
take the floor i says to the manager
pushin him out of the dressin room the
timekeepers backs out thumbin their
watches sos to call time on us as soon
as theyre gone i turns on the bunch

  were in for it boys    and weve
got to face the music these birds dont
play basketball-they dont even make no
pretense at it-but they sure play an air-
tight skin game we havent got a chance
in the world buckin it the only hope
is to go out there on that floor and beat
em at their own game its goin to be
tougher than tough    but boys if you
dont do it were cleaned bag and baggage
tooth and toothbrush

  come on gang snarls loop the
whites of his eyes turnin red the team
knows their backs is more than against
the wall and they comes around with a
savage whoop flingin open the door and
bustin through the entrance to the hall
shootin out on the birdcage floor like a
half-spent cyclone

  say the hisses they gets makes my re-
ception seem like an afternoon tea its
the first sight the boys gets of the floor
incidentally and their shots all hit the
beams makin them look like a bunch of
rookies the crowd gives them the jeery
ha ha and before they can get their bear-

ings the manager and referee is callin

time

  i squeezes my way in sneakin along
the side of the floor and kneelin down
next to the timekeepers with my two subs
behind me they is terribly excited and
sore because only five men can play basket-
ball at one time    but they shouldnt
have had no regrets ill bet every john
henry of an all-american rambler in the
line-up wished hed never seen the outside
cover of a basketball when he got the first
glance at the northern star quintet

  man oh man i see them in my sleep
yet-five of the rawest-boned leather-
lunged hairy-chested iron-muscled mac-
fadden-cultured giants in captivity they
looked like the heavyweight division of
the new york police department in search
of a wild night the shortest player is
six feet tall and the only reason hes not
as tall as the others is because his arches
have fell

  just then the heat feels so oppressive
that i think im goin to drop from a stove
stroke loop is takin his place at center
against a six feet four midget called mon-
tana    and his map sure looks like it
loops lean and lanky himself but he sizes
up with this raw product as a blade of
grass to a stem of alfala the referee
tosses up the ball between them and they
jump till they almost bump their heads
on the beams

loop is quicker and gets the ball while
the crowd opens fire with a tonsil-
splittin overture but montana grabs
loop gets his hands on the ball and jerks
it away from him startin off down the
two-by-four floor while our whole team
screams foul foul i jumps up and
waves a towel at the referee but some
tough mountain bird behind gets a hold
of my collar and slaps me down on my
knees again the referee is deaf dumld
and blind to all jabberin and montana
reaches up and drops the ball through the
hoop while loop is still tryin to tell the
self-appointed official that were not playin
accordin to football rules its evident
right from the start that everythings wide
open and that loop isnt goin to get a
chance to score any points on fouls-which
we always count on strong

  the first half is a delirium to me with
the basket busters	

the playin floor a mass of legs and arms
and the air singin like it was full of all
the noise since the days of adams mother-
in-law all i know is that the all-amer-
ican ramblers is gettin knocked down and
stepped on by a combination of steam
roller and tractor movements the boys
seem that there is no chance tryin to play
basketball goes in for roughin it up with
these backwoodsmen which is about as sen-
sible as tryin to feed pepper to an ele-
phant

  and to make matters worse than worst
every time one of the boys violates the
rules pat sullivan the nifty little man-
ager-referee promptly calls a foul and
gives his winners end guarantee team
a chance to make a free throw the first
time he pulls this loop starts to take the
ramblers off the floor and call it quits but
the crowd sets up such a boo that the sweat
freezes right on their shirts to leave
that floor is courtin three kinds of sudden
death

  the northern stars has a system of
short passes workin the ball right up to
the basket where soup stearns their bean-
pole forward plunks it in eddie jordan
at back guard is neatly put out of the way
by the other forward who holds him while
soup rings em up oh the boys is scorch-
in mad all right-but what can they do
every once and awhile the northern stars
iets us score a basket just for the fun of
it and the crowd boos some more i hate
to count up the score when the timekeep-
ers decide to call it a first half im aw-
ful relieved to find its only  to  in
their favor i thought sure itd be 
the boys drags themselves to the dressin
room for the ten-minute intermission
lookin like the finish of the olympic
marathon and im wringin three gal-
lons of nervous perspiration out of my
shirt and vest    besides havin mani-
cured all my finger nails clear out of sight
with my teeth

  cheer up boys i says tryin to radi-
ate optimism the games only half
over  

  say somethin else twice as funny
blurts out loop supersaturatin a towel
with the h two os that is erodin from
his pores we aint got no more chance
of winnin this game than a rooster has of
layin an egg

  well if you views it that way she does
look pretty slim i admits not wantin
the boys to think too heavy on the finan-
cial end of the loss but i claim its
right shameful the way youre lettin them
baby dolls maul you around theys got
you all buncoed theys nothin but a
bunch of lumberjack farmers and they
doesnt know any more about basketball
than i knows about pickin cherries   
but they sure knows how to wrap you up
and tie you into little thirty-cent packages
say handin the boys a line like this in
their frames of mind is just like puttin
pop corn kernels in a popper and holdin
it over a sizzlin fire they busts out
white around the mouths from internal
combustion and jumps about the room too
hot to stand still

  pretty soft for you throws in eddie
jordan who looks like a troop of white
house cavalry has run over him well
   whats left of me to state is hereby
servin notice that if i comes through this
game with my right identity-im through
for good get me through for good
i reaches out my hand to him quick
shake i says thems my senti-
ments 

  this puts the boys on my side again

fttonder when the next trains
vv out asks jim nursin a black
eye and a cut lip

  the next trains in i retorts this
is all the farther she goes    and she
goes out wrhen she gets ready that ought
to be just as soon as we finishes makin
our little public appearance

  heres hopin grunts eddie this is
one of them times when you wishes youd
never been born

  did you ever see any place so hot
asks loop drenchin another towel youd
better bring all the dry linen from the
dressin room with you cause i dont
hanker to get drowned on top of all this
and it wouldnt be bad to have the arnica
handy you sat there like a bump on a
boys forehead all the first half and never
offered to so much as give us a piece of
adhesive tape

  thats because i hastens to explain
when i sees you needs doctorin and starts
to beat it for the dressin room to get the
stuff-some big jay grabs me by the nape
	basketball stories

of the only neck ive got and throws me
for a four-yard loss on the floor

  well dont lets forget the essentials
this time pleads loop i feels the ap-
proachin necessity of first aid

  trust me boys says i ill take the
little old black grip

  and just then we hears the whistle blow-
in for the start of the second half all
the boys lets out a groan which comes all
the ways from the bottoms of their rub-
ber soles they troops out to another
round of cordial hisses lookin about as
fresh and full of life as a cluster of wilted
lettuce

  i grabs up the gripsack takin all the
towels we got-includin the ones loops
just got through soakin-and parks my-
self down in the same place next to the
timekeepers theres no one opened any
windows and the hall is just like a fur-
nace with the warmth of the human bodies
addin to the heat its all you can do to
keep from smotherin but the hoinefolks
seems to stand up under it with the forti-
tude of hothouse plants i hasnt dared
give any thought as to what is goin to
happen when the game is finished its
all i can do to keep my throbbin pulses
on the immediate present

  the delirium of the first half is resumed
with some tremens added to it the
northern stars runs the score up to fifty
quicker than a burroughs addin machine
then loop calls for time out and yells
for a towel i heaves a nice dry cloth
out on the floor and the boys pass it around
stallin for time and lookin at their measly
eight points on the scoreboard

  the northern stars thinkin this towel
wipin is a professional stunt calls for a
towel too its really quite embarrassin
no one has thought to bring any towels
along for the home hopes theres nothin
for me to do but oblige which i does with
a grand manner that wins the first gen-
uine applause the manager-referee glow-
ers at me and calls time and i gets the
towels thrown back in my face-but im
glad to get em back at all

  it aint five seconds after the game is
started again before eddie jordan goes
down for the count with a badly wrenched
knee he calls for bandages and i rips
open my gripsack feelin around for the
first-aid stuff when all of a sudden i

realize that i aint got my gripsack at all

  ive got loops-and all i can find in
the thing is the apparatus loaded with in-
sect powder this wont hardly do for
a sprained knee and i throws it down with
disgust loop is callin towel towel
so i heaves the towel out to him again
while im wonderin what im goin to do
about eddie

  them that knows says a good idea never
strikes twice in the same place and im
livin testimony that this is the only iron-
clad velvet-lined product of mental ac-
tivity that ever entered my cranium either
before or after eatin

vii

the northern stars are yippin for
the other towel again and i grabs it
up and stuffs it inside the grip and takes
the bellows of the insect powder appara-
tus and sprays the towel thick then i
quick takes the apparatus and stuffs it in-
side my coat it only takes a few seconds
and no one is payin much attention to
me thinkin im all excited about gettin
bandages for my back guard whos layin
out on the floor like a sick horse

  montana comes idlin over to the side-
lines

  that towel mister-how about our
usin it some more

  oh the towel i says pretendin like
id not understood sure thing here
you be and drags it out of the grip toss-
in it to him

  montana plunges his drippin face into it
and i almost bites my tongue waitin to see
whats goin to happen he stops rubbin
all of a sudden and looks out from behind
the towel blinkin his eyes and wrinklin
his nose then he tosses the towel to the
other stars whats waitin their turn and
walks around in circles shakin his head
im the only one that notices this as the
crowds mostly interested in booin eddie
the referee comes over to tell me ill have
to put in a substitute as two minutes time
is up and eddie isnt this is agreeable
with me and i calls eddie off the floor
although hes rarin to sink with the rest of
the crew

  they dont get a chance to go on with the
game because just as the teams in linin up
the northern stars is thrown into seven
the basket busters



kinds of sneezin fits i have to run out on
the floor to pick up the towel thats laden
with bradys scentless sure-fire insect
powder i jams the towel in the grip and
slips the grip to eddie

  eddie if you love me take this grip to
the dressin room p d q and when you
gets there take the towel out and hide it
where you cant find it then take all our
belongins and pitch em out the window in
the snow drifts-and wait for us till this
fracas is over dont ask no questions-
beat it

  eddie gives me a funny look but he can
tell i got somethin else up my sleeve be-
sides my winter underwear he takes the
bag and limps out of the hall the crowd
makin way for him and thinkin nothin
about it everyone is wonderin whats
struck the tough mountain huskies and
even my boys cant interpret their sneezes
a fan sittin next to me thinks its an acute
attack of the flu and gets out his handker-
chief to breathe through sos the germs
wont get up his nose

  i wigwags to loop that we got em on
the run and though loop cant guess
nothin he knows enough to kick to the
referee because the game aint goin on
with the score  to  it dont look natural
that our boys should all at once be eager
for more punishment the northern stars
is standin around wheezin like a chorus of
asthmatics their eyes runnin rivers the
referee wont start the game till he finds
out whats the matter and montana begins
to point at where he thinks i am but he
cant see past his nose i knows things are
desperate but im ready to play my cards
when i have to show em the wise little
college graduate of a skin game manager
comes trottin over to me

  wheres that towel you lent our boys
he snaps surly like

  wheres your requistion i retaliates

  none of your buffoonery the mana-
ger is hoppin mad pie stoops down and
jabs his hand into the bunch of used towels
theyre all soppin wet but i points out the
wettest one

  go ahead-take it if you want it your
steam-heated alaskans just about ruined it
anyhow

  this the one  he inquires suspiciously
boldin it close to his nose and goin over it
like a customs house official

  how could it be any other i throws
back

  the manager turns the towel over to
montana whose vision is still about seven-
seven and montana feels it sniffin at his
fingers the other stars crowd around
like a lot of help the blind boys but they
dont get any more kick out of the towel so
they cant do nothin and all this time
loop is walkin around like a caged-up
panther ravin about everythin in general
hes got the whole crowd so down on him
that they is gnashin their teeth hes
callin the northern stars quitters and
bums and sneeze babies and all the
choice names he can think of which are
calculated to insult without causin a gen-
eral riot

the first wave of sneezin gets over but
the eyes is still liquidatin when the
referee calls the game to order but shes a
different complex now the all-american
ramblers is once more a ball cluh-a
razzle-dazzlin rip-roarin thunder-bustin
outfit    the reason bein that they aint
got no opposition montana jumps at cen-
ter when he hears the whistle blow although
he cant see the ball the others cant see
it either but they aint worried none all
they got to do is stand around and let their
eyes do the runnin because theyre so far
out in front they dont know what a ca-
boose looks like loop takes the ball right
down-the floor and shoves it through the
basket on a close-up shot the crowd
laughs score  to  i glances at my
watch fifteen good big juicy minutes
left a five to one chance and no takers
everything has been took back goes the
ball to center and back it goes for another
basket for us this process is repeated
with variations till the score gets to
- jim not even hopeful yet   
im just lookin on and feelin sort of numb
eyes on my ticker every other second if
the second half would last an hour and the
northern stars would stay under the influ-
ence of bradys powdered extract its my
opinion we would overhaul em

  but its surprisin what a short time it
takes to count by twos when youre hittin
the rim about once every fifteen seconds
first thing i know the scores - with
the crowd gettin worried the referee gaz-
in anxiously toward the timekeepers and
	basketball stories

the eyeless northern stars staggerin about
tryin to get in front of loop and the other
members of our team whore slippin in and
out like honeybees to a hive

  three minutes to play im up on my
feet with the best indian war whoop ever
invented by a white man which even sends
shivers down my spine the boys responds
to my encouragement like a flock of chick-
ens at a dinner call all they got to do is
keep out of the way of the lumberin lum-
berjacks and no matter if the stars is clus-
tered around the basket imitatin a five-man
defense they cant stop nothin that they
cant see the tears is runnin down their
faces like someone has left the water run-
nin in the front hose on the lawn but
they is a stubborn bunch of gladiators its
like the magician says the more you try
the less you see    which dont prevent
them from keepin on tryin they is
furious at us and would slaughter us with-
out even pagin the butcher if they had all
their necessary faculties

  with the score  to  and a half a
minute to play im as looney as a goofer
bird i can see all my money cornin back
to me after ive kissed it good-by and
packed it in alcohol but the effects of
bradys bedbug antiseptic is beginnin to
wear off and montana is gettin back his
normal vision he takes a cock-eyed squint
at the scoreboard and blows the last rem-
nants of the powder out of his system with
an angry sneeze the ramblers aint
climbed clear up from the bottom of the
well for nothin how-so-ever and before
montana can get his peepers wide open
loop has brought the house down with two
rapid-fire shots under the basket jumpin
us into the lead

  theres no game ever been played the
equal of this fiasco and right there is where
strong men went weak and weak men went
strong i bounds out on the hardwood
arena yellin bloody murder and yellow-
back novels because time is up and weve
won  to -but before i gets a chance
to curl my arms affectionately about loop
the referee steps in

  whats your hurry  he asks while the
crowd takes up the refrain

  hurry says i the games over
  did my timekeepers say so he returns
  no but my watch did

 go back and sit down he orders

this game aint any wheres near over

yet

viii

what good does it do me if im a
conscientious objector the boys
raise an awful row but the eyeballs of the
northern stars is dried up now    and
they can see our finish the crowd can
too pandemonium is a primary word
when it comes to describin this scene

  im cryin and sobbin and carryin on
somethin hysterical folks are tearin
their hair and collars and throats the
boys looks to me with despair written over
their faces as the referee tosses the ball up
at center and montana pounces on it like
he did before his eyes went back on him
theres the wildest mix-up i ever see with
sluggin trippin holdin and shovin-
and finally out of all the mess comes mon-
tana to put the ball through the hoop for a
tie score  everyones usin everyone elses
back for a bass drum and while theyre
doin that i races out on the floor grabbin
loop by the arm

  follow me i yells runnin for the
front exit and wavin to the rest of the
boys

  they dont need any urgin even though
they is about ready to drop in their tracks
we is to the doorway before the crowd
realizes whats up then they lets up an
awful howl and the manager and the whole
northern star team takes after us

  the citizenry near the exit tries to inter-
fere but i has loops patented powder
shootin device out now and shoots clouds
of insect killer into their faces we fights
our way through a mass of sneezes out of
the hall and up to the window of the tough
mountain syndicate mr websters
standin at the outside door lookin all
alone as hes the only one not interested
enough to watch the game wes in such
an awful hurry that we pays no attention
to him i smashes in the window with my
fist and shouts to loop

  get in there and get our money i com-
mands four thousand berries is all we
want dont touch nothin else

  loop dives through the window almost
rippin out the sash the other boys forms
a five-man defense around it while i steps
out in front pointin my bellows arrange-
the basket busters



ment toward the narrow exit door that
everyones got to come through to get at
us mr webster tries to raise an objection
but jim codfrey kicks him out of the door-
way into the snow and the landlord lays
there like a broken piece of china loop
is just crawlin through the window with
his fists full of greenbacks when pat sulli-
van the schemin little manager dashes
from the hall right into the muzzle of
the insect powder sprayer i lets him have
both barrels he backs into the arms of
the northern stars chokin and spittin
it aint long before i lays down a regular
smoke screen of powder which is well-nigh
impenetrable jim holds the outer door
open and the wind blows through wafting
the powder inside that stuffy hall till the
interior is one continuous outbreak of
ker-choos the northern stars gets
the same dose all over again only worse
the whole crowd is laid out stiff

  we dont wait to leave our handwritin
on the wall but dashes right outdoors into
below zero weather with the boys riskin
pneumonia germs by the millions-but they
is so hot that they dont stop to think theys
dressed like a flock of cross-country run-
ners i leads em around to the side of the
buildin where eddie jordan is waitin with
their street clothes jammed in grips-and
we grabs these and finds the road somehow
and starts kangarooin it in the direction
of the railroad station there aint no one
in sight and the night is dark-but of
course the snow lights things up a bit
its a good half mile anyhow and we dont

know whether therell be a train there
when we gets there

that bein the case you should have
heard the cheer that goes up when we
catches the gleam of a locomotive headlight
from that moment ive always claimed that
dame fortune is a grand old woman
there settin on the track in front of the
depot is a combination freight and passen-
ger train the station agent is so scared
at seein a bunch of white figures come
streakin toward the depot that he runs out
and hides in a snowdrift we dont linger
to buy tickets but piles into the only coach
while i hunts up the engineer to inquire
when the magnificent string of cars he has
hitched to his steam buggy is due to leave

  were waitin on the conductor now he
says polite enough but soon as he shows
up were off

  ive got five hundred dollars that says
dont wait for the conductor i proposes

  the engineer scratches his head and looks
at the money

  what good is a conductor on this road
anyhow  he drawls as he puts his hand on
the throttle

  its almost fifteen years now and i aint
seen that engineer since but i sends him a
post card of graditude every memorable
anniversary

  the all-american ramblers stopped
ramblin after that and now i got a quintet
at home what tears up the parlor rug   
and a wife what cant understand why im
so tender-hearted toward bedbugs

fct m ie you may want pie but what
rim telling you is youll get over-
j- ripe eggs if you dont give redding
a basketball team that will beat browns-
burg

  the words exploded from the lips of
kitty gilroy owner of the milk 
honey restaurant she was reddings
civic booster no  and let the world
know it

  condon goodspeed was on the receiving
end he sighed sensing that a beautiful
quiet life must be ahead of him as red-
dings new basketball coach

  beat beat beat

  it was the same old cry conny had heard
everywhere since he and kitty graduated
from midland u five years before and
she returned to her little hometown to run
a restaurant while he went out to engage
in the heartless and thankless racket of
coaching basketball

  beat brownsburg

  less than a week ago conny had vowed
never again to indulge in the bitter sense-
less rivalries born of basketball basket-
ball was a game it was supposed to be
fun why should he grit his teeth and re-
solve to cut brownsburg up for hash

  i havent anything against browns-
burg he told kitty

  kitty stamped indignantly

  you will have theyll put something
over on you they keep redding isolated
they try to show the rest of the state we
dont amount to much-so they can eventu-
ally take our courthouse away from us
they have our whole town cowed they
cheat us out of basketball games and
they beat us out of a state road just this
year so we cant have home basketball
games in our new gym after the weather
gets bad

  hm said goodspeed looking down at
kitty her wide brown eyes her lips her
chin-her whole upturned face-were
pleading


pie-eating coach goodspeed nursed
those redding bucket loopers into as
hot a quintet as that cassaba circuit had
ever seen but the big-ieague browns
burg jinx clung to them like the seven
years itch

  beat brownsburg

  conny bit his lips and ran powerful fin-
gers through his yellow hair tiny sparks
in his eyes mounted into flame he squared
his shoulders here was a challenge a
call to battle and he never in his life had
been able to resist that call

conny goodspeed poured bas-
ketball into the youth of redding

high

  all right you turtles move before you
grow fast    harben youre twice too
slow on that dribble under    francisco
shake the lead out of your pants and fol-
low in to take the ball off the backboard
   you forwards know how that criss-
cross goes lets see you put some zip
into it    pass that ball howell pass
it do you have to have an opening as
big as a railroad tunnel    come on
helms get in there and stop rubush
whatre you waiting for an introduction
to him pardon my social blunder   
no no no all of you-flock around
let me tell you about that spot pass again
in the weeks preceding the opening of
the season the players were convinced that
their running passing and dribbling put
end to end would have reached around the
earth 

  and kitty gilroy kept drumming into
their ears beat brownsburg

  the older generation said it couldnt be
done just as an older generation always
does and the younger generation as usual
had no more sense than to think it could be
done

  the team became a pack of whooping
back-slapping hyenas who under connys
inspiration laid out their old friends wil-
liamsboro - in their opening game

  not bad conny told them thats as
many games as you won all last year

  they easily took rossville and new
paris next

  now said conny all you have to do
is beat brownsburg

  brownsburg was not asleep to the fact


	basketball stories

that a sound beating might be in store for
them they got busy town and team

  but redding townsfolk only moaned
their leading apostles of gloom were hez
rubush whose son hughes was the teams
left forward and ab howell father of
screech first string backguard

  beat brownsburg it cant be done
they took turns in telling conny

the game was played in redding the
score at the half was - and a roar-
ing redding team steamed out for the
third quarter

  woody harben was spearhead of the
redding attack he came in and took the
first center tip from francisco pivoted
and dribbled down a wide-open slot to go
in the air and push one over the rim

  slippery helms floorguard stole the
next pass from the fingertips of a browns-
burg forward dribbled down the sideline
hooked a pass into harben and harben
went under and pocketed a fast one off the
backboard he netted a long one for his
third straight field goal and brownsburg
took time out

  the rest helped them get together and
they matched redding scoring for the re-
mainder of the third quarter which ended
-

  redding was about to believe in miracles
though conny was not letting himself and
his team be deceived

  the toughest grind is ahead he told
the boys brownsburg has a veteran
team

  and experience told in the last eight
minutes brownsburg tied the score at
- instead of resting redding speeded
up its attack and was holding even at -
with three minutes to go they were over-
playing and finally began to fumble and
make wild passes

  brownsburg seized the opportunity to
turn on more heat and pulled away to win
-

  redding fans even kitty gilroy moped
away from the gym to them the game
was only another humiliation at the hands
of a rival they detested but conny thought
his kids looked plenty hot

  he breezed into kitty gilroys restaurant
chin up and smiling

  what kind of pie you got

  kitty scowled at him

  didnt i tell you youd get eggs in-
stead of pie if you didnt beat browns-
burg well be watching your step when
we are hemmed in by snow drifts on our
one lone miserable mountain road and the 
citizens fully realize our new gym is a
dead loss in winter youll hear moaning
that will reach you to the moon it would
have been different if brownsburg hadnt
beaten us out of a state highway just as
they beat us out of everything we could
have had home games all winter and if
you had beaten brownsburg tonight it
would have carried you over for a year but
now look out

  theres another brownsburg game com-
ing conny reminded her

  yes she said hopelessly on browns-
burgs floor

the brownsburg game ended home
contests in redding it was the first
of december any day the main road
which went five miles west to cross black
oak ridge at buffalo gap and then came
back six miles on the other side of the ridge
to join the state highway at brownsburg
was due to become impassable to modern
traffic

  except for basketball practice the big
redding gymnasium was a deserted struc-
ture to get to the scenes of their re-
maining games redding would walk to
brownsburg over the three-mile short
cut a trail they had hoped to persuade the
state to make into an improved highway
and take cars from there

  the future looked discouraging but
conny goodspeed ate pie and fought on

  the redding first team took nine games
in a row the gloomiest citizens except
hez rubush and ab howell saw at least
the faint glimmer of a brightening future

  the town was becoming basketball-
minded woody harben sensational for-
ward became an idol business picked up
at the milk  honey every eve-
ning the younger generation flocked in to
be near woody who wanted to be near
coach goodspeed who wanted to be near
kitty gilroy dyed-in-the-wool grum-
blers talked of taking brownsburg the
next time and there was almost an era
of good feeling

  public spirited kitty gilroy had high
hopes
hoodooed

  conny wed have a swell town if we
had a good highway she said and
brownsburg is just a week away i can
hardly wait

  he grinned

  if we dont win at brownsburg you
and i had better not come back had we

  we cant possibly lose she said

  i dont see how we can either conny
told her

the main road from redding had not
yet been closed by bad weather when
the evening of the return game at browns-
burg arrived half of redding accom-
panied the team and noisily backed the
boys that coach goodspeed was sending
out to take a tenth straight game

  but no one on either side expected an
easy time coach speck lawrence had his
brownsburg boys pointed to the minute
they held a three-point lead at the quarter
and conny saw there was something wrong
with redding hughes rubush was al-
ways a step too slow and screech howells
usually brilliant dribbling looked like a slow
motion picture of hop-scotch

  at the half brownsburg was leading
-

  conny hustled his confused athletes to
their dressing room for a pointed consulta-
tion ab howell came paddling along be-
hind with the shining mug of a prophet who
had just cleaned the bases in his own home
town

  what did i tell you he said

  hez rubush bogged in next with an
identical message of hope he looked at
conny and he looked at all the tender young
worldings who had launched upon this
basketball enterprise with such high am-
bitions

  see what did i tell you

  conny clouded up and looked down on
ab and hez lightning flashed in his eyes
thunder rolled in his throat he jerked
a tough thumb toward the door that led
from the room ab and hez correctly per-
ceived they were getting the doctors or-
ders to start traveling for their health

  when they were gone conny swung
around at his regulars

  now what did  tell you

  hughes rubush and screech howell
looked down their noses woody har-
ben came up with the proper answer

hoopsters	

  you said we couldnt beat brownsburg
unless we remembered our teamwork and
drove hard

  correct rubush you cant hit long
ones work that ball down the floor   
and howell you dribble as if you ex-
pected to drop over with heart failure any
minute  you fellows are all in con-
dition and i want to see some action in
this next half you can win this game yet
but not by dragging around waiting for
your arteries to harden take time to
get into formation and then break fast
now im going to have a board handy
and if you punkin-heads dont play the
way ive been drilling it into you for the
last four months im going to raise some
blisters that will be the talk of the town
and they wont be on your elbows

  in the third quarter the team tried to
get going but the trouble of the first half
held over the split-second precision of
perfect teamwork was not there woody
harben saw the minutes passing with
brownsburg increasing its lead when a
time-out and analysis of troubles failed to
improve teamwork he took the game into
his own hands and ran wild to out-score
brownsburg for the third quarter and pull
up to within four points of them at -

  but no man could hold the pace at which
he drove himself for many minutes he
slowed down in the fourth and the team
went to pieces with howell and rubush
now trying too hard to come through fall-
ing down utterly brownsburg fans
shrieked their delight and redding sat mute
and stunned

  the final score was - and redding
moaned as the last gun barked all but
hez rubush and ab howell they came
around looking wise

  conny snarled i suppose you two think
youve won the pennant in the prophets
league

  whatever happened  kitty gilroy
agonized

  i dont know said conny our team
is ten points better than brownsburg there
was something wrong with rubush and
howell

with redding floundering in the sub-
basement of despair a payment came
due on the gymnasium the towns nine
hundred and twenty-three residents remem-
	basketball stories

bered it simultaneously they growled on
every cracker box and rocking chair in
the village

  kitty sang blues conny the gym has
not made a dime to date and when i was
fighting for it i told everyone it would
be self-supporting of course if browns-
burg hadnt beaten us out of that good
road

conny struck a blue note too yeah
and then we have the mildest winter in
a lifetime if wed only known we could
have scheduled home games every month
he dug his fingers into his yellow hair
what kind of pie you got

  as he ate cherry pie kitty said i
could weep i could fight i could even
swear this town is now down on basket-
ball gymnasiums community spirit- itll
be a whole  ear before we can play browns-
burg again if ever

  conny scowled he remembered hez
rubush and ab howell gloating because
they had hit for an average of  in
the pessimists conference then he
looked up at kitty and his eyes were
brighter

  good old inspiring pie he said and
his eyes were flashing how about an
invitational tourney next month to show
these muttering minnies what a basket-
ball team can really do for a town the
roads wont go bad now ill book a
couple of bigger schools i know theyll
bring a whole caravan of fans well fill
up ab howells hotel for the first time
in its history and eat up all the groceries
in the town well bring in brownsburg
and maybe get a chance-

  yes get a chance to let them finish
ruining us

  conny looked up sharply and his eyes
snapped

say are you going pessimist too
well with rubush and howell-
whoa wait conny called out sud-
denly rubush and howell isnt that
the combination brownsburg worked on
to beat redding out of the state highway
it certainly is kitty answered they
got hez rubush to feeling the road should
come in past his filling station at the west
end of town and then convinced ab
howell it should come in past his hotel
at the east end there was such a dog-
fight between the rubush and howell fac-

tions the state highway department de-
cided we didnt care whether we got a
road or not

  listen said conny were going to
corner those two old fuddy-duddies

  kitty saw the light

  brownsburg has been working on them
in some way she declared

she and conny confronted ab howell
first kitty swung from the ankles
she knew who worked on ab howell

  ab howell whats jud walker been
talking to you about

  abs eyes bobbed around as if he were
hunting a window to dive through

  out with it kitty demanded youre
the biggest boob in this town those
brownsburg gangsters can always come
around and soft soap you into making a
goose of yourself

  ab spluttered as if blowing out a mouth-
ful of fuzz conny stepped directly in
front of him and he had something on
his face besides a healthy complexion he
tossed his yellow hair and thrust his chin
forward and reminded ab of a serious
young bovine creature that was about to
paw the earth and start charging

  ab broke down

  screech is my boy and i have a right
to look out for his best interests all
five of the main players on the browns-
burg basketball team two years ago have
heart trouble and cant do a days work
kitty said according to jud walker
did you go down and investigate for your-
self

  w-e-e---

  well no said kitty

  conny said but anyhow you told
screech he had to take it easy and not
strain himself or you wouldnt let him
play basketball at all

  abs mouth dropped open

  did screech tell you

  of course not kitty exploded coach
goodspeed is not as dumb as you are he
can put two and two together

  yes snapped conny now lets go
out and get hez rubush

  okay kitty flung a parting look at
ab and said scornfully everytime
brownsburg wants to start something in
this town it always finds ab howell and
hez rubush ready to help
hoodooed

  she was right court riley from
brownsburg had told hez rubush the
heart-rending story of the former browns-
burg basketball stars who were supposed
to be physical wrecks and hez had
gulped it down and admonished his ath-
letic offspring to ease up on those lung-
bursting fourth-quarter victory drives if
he didnt want to spend the rest of his
life in a wheel-chair or something

  brownsburg had put over another fast
one and hez rubush and ab howell were
the suckers

  conny was mad and steamed up for
vengeance

  whats the use sighed the older heads
brownsburgll make goats out of us
again

  but the basketball team and the school
shared their coachs feeling and inasmuch
as there was everything to gain and noth-
ing to lose that wasnt already lost any-
way the town reluctantly consented to
play host to an invitational tourney

  grossport cedar falls and brownsburg
were to be the guests nearly a thousand
tournament tickets were sold redding
citizens showed slight indications of en-
thusiasm and ab howell even washed the
windows of the howell house

  first time thats happened since i was
in high school said kitty i believe
redding will become public-mindecl some
day conny hows the team 

  connys face lighted up like a window
display

  great and we drew brownsburg for
the second game

  the first game between grossport and
cedar falls was to start at seven-thirty
friday evening the other game was to
start at eight forty-five on saturday
afternoon the losing teams were scheduled
to play a consolation at two oclock with the
championship battle to start at three

at four oclock on friday a blizzard
the only storm of the winter hit the
little town it had started with rain turned
to sleet and now there was snow half knee
deep the black skies overhead were no
darker than the gloom that enveloped red-
ding

  conny goodspeed and kitty gilroy
stood and looked out through the front
window of the milk  honey be-

hoopsters	

yond the courthouse square loomed the
gymnasium a ghost in a shroud of snow
kittys fists were clenched her fingernails
cutting into her palms

  no one can get here she gasped
goodspeed nodded his face was grim
i guess this finishes basketball and me
in redding

  and me too kitty sighed i per-
suaded the town to build the gym and
whats worse for the moment ive had
all the merchants lay in an extra supply
of food stuffs-and i dont mean canned
goods and the aid societies of the
churches have mountains of sandwiches
and oceans of soup when you set the
table for a thousand and no one comes
-ill bet the local merchants will lose three
or four hundred dollars and im to
blame

  conny squared his shoulders defiantly
at the swirling snow outside he looked
at his wristwatch

  anyway its more than three hours till
the opening game something may hap-
pen ive known it to

  kitty looked at conny as if she thought
he believed in fairies

  conny she said emphatically noth-
ing can come over black oak ridge on
a night like this

  conny looked at her own extra stock
of pies racked six deep on the restaurant
counter

  what kind of pie you got he asked
there was the hint of a smile on his face
but he couldnt outgame kitty

  apple chocolate cherry pineapple and
lemon she answered

  two cherries and a quart of milk he
ordered

  he looked up at the end of the first
pie

  kitty said lucky its so bad outside
that everyone stays in otherwise wed
probably be mobbed

  conny quaffed the cream from his quart
of milk

  i cant give up its stormy but its
not really so cold i think cedar falls
will be here

  hunch asked kitty

  no theyre like that at cedar falls
  hows their team 

  better than brownsburg but we can
beat em if we get the breaks


basketball stories

at six oclock there was a roaring
through the main street of redding
and it wasnt the storm conny was com-
ing across the courthouse yard from the
gym where he had inspected the lights and
the heating plant to see if they were work-
ing properly he looked down the street
and saw the red and green eyes of great
automotive monsters plowing their way
through the snow

  he ran to the door of the milk 
honey

  kitty he yelled its cedar falls
kitty ran out the motorcade was pull-
ing along in front of the courthouse now
radiators were steaming windows of
the buses were frosted over snow was
packed on windshields except for the little
spots kept clear by the clicking wipers
motors raced horns blared and sirens on
private cars screamed the news of their
arrival

  kitty could not refrain from cheering
conny jumped on the step of the lead bus
and directed the delegation to the gym-
nasium the cars began disgorging scores
of visitors

  its warm in the gym conny called
to them then he called aid society
ladies by telephone and told them to bring
on their food

  a few minutes later he was going into
the milk  honey accompanied by
a robust muscular middle-aged man

well have one game anyway he
sang out lustily col brewington this
is kitty gilroy reddings leading booster
kitty exclaimed however did you get
here col brewington

  oh we had all the skid chains and
tow-lines in cedar falls with us he said

  and the colonel handled motor trans-
ports in france conny volunteered

  did you see anything of the other
teams kitty asked

  the colonel nodded

  brownsburg flatly refused to come and
they discouraged grossport into turning
back

  and you came anyway

  col brewington smiled

  yes in the first place i knew all the
expense and trouble that you would have
gone to to entertain us and in the sec-
ond place at cedar falls we just arent
in the habit of turning back

the referees opening whistle blast
sounded promptly at seven-thirty in
reddings gymnasium there was only
half of the anticipated crowd but the
courageous trip of cedar falls had gained
that town a warm spot in the heart of
redding and there was a high feeling of
enthusiasm and fellowship such as redding
had never known

  the other two teams having failed to
come representatives of redding and
cedar falls agreed to crown the winner
of their game the tournament champion
and then follow the game with a dance

  conny had his team in great spirits
after the brownsburg hoax and they
pulled away to an early lead cedar falls
began to click in the second quarter and
trailed by only two points at the half which
ended -

  in the second half the two teams battled
doggedly minute after minute with red-
ding holding on to the long end of the score
by the scantest of margins redding had
a two-point advantage with a minute to
go but francisco let the cedar falls center
get away from him and dribble in to knot
the count at - seconds later the gun
ended the regulation playing time

  the overtime period was a furious melee
that had the fans stamping their feet and
screaming the first minute passed with-
out a score and the second and there
was but ten seconds of the period left
when woody harben arched one from
center that fell through to give redding
the game

  amid the milling of the crowd follow-
ing the end of the game conny goodspeed
felt a hand upon his arm he turned and
saw lawrence the brownsburg coach

  lawrence said it was a pretty tough
trip but we got here in time to play the
second game

  second game said goodspeed

  lawrence grinned as one who was sure
he could out-smart a fox

  sure brownsburg and redding play
the second game in- he looked at his
watch -in twenty minutes

  the brownsburg players came onto the
floor they had taken their time and
walked over the ridge to redding arriving
just after the start of the second half and
keeping their presence a secret until the
end of the cedar falls-redding game
hoodooed

conny goodspeeds face flushed
in anger he saw the trap the
brownsburg coach had laid for him

  you told col brewington you werent
coming conny reminded him

  speck lawrence merely shrugged his
shoulders

  but that was not an official withdrawal
and we changed our minds all we wrere
obligated to do was be on hand at the
time set for our game to begin

  he was technically within his rights
though much could have been said about
his sportsmanship col brewington came
to the assistance of goodspeed

  why not wait play them tomorrow
no lawrence insisted we play red-
ding tonight-and you tomorrow

  conny goodspeed straightened an-
grily he ran his fingers through his yel-
low hair his eyes glared steadily at speck
lawrence

  okay lawrence we play tonight
he said and well see whether you play
tomorrow

  by now the crowd was aware of what
had happened reddings youth was boo-
ing but the oldsters shook their heads and
wagged their tongues

  no use no use brownsburg is just
too slick for us

  kitty gilroys eyes flamed

  she is is she kitty snapped all
right hang around tonights the night
she gets the cure for what ails her

  the cedar falls delegation to the last
man joined the redding rooters as the
game got under way

big pershing francisco got the initial
tip-off for redding and peaches
greenbury starting in place of hughes
rubush came in fast and snared it he
hooked a sharp pass to woody harben
toward the right sideline and woody shot
and hit

  the crowd cheered and conny smacked
his big fists down on his knees

  thats flying the mail he said to ru-
bush and screech howell who was also
held from the starting lineup weve got
to get the jump on em before we wear out
then ill pull greenbury and fletcher and
put you two back in and well just hold our
lead

-basketball stories-winter

hoopsters	

  on the next play there was a double
shuttle down court between fletcher and
francisco francisco drove in went high
in front of the basket and one-handed a
beauty

  the brownsburg captain tongue-lashed
his mates they tightened their defense
but redding with such cheering behind
it as it never had known before played in-
spired ball greenbury slipped his guard
and hit two more from the field the
brownsburg players took time out with the
score - against them

   theirs was a veteran lineup which diag-
nosed its troubles quickly returning to
action they told a different story they
spread an impregnable zone defense which
checked abruptly the down-court drives
of redding and they closed the gap in
the score until it stood at -

  woody harben gasped to francisco
theyre tying me up coach says shoot a
few long ones in a place like this try
some

   he hit on his first effort but missed the
next woody came into mid-court snared
a pass wheeled and arched in a long one

  the quarter ended the second quarter
started the brownsburg team began a
macfiine-like assault upon the redding
basket calmly relentlessly they cut down
the redding lead

  conny goodspeed muttered that cedar
falls overtime took more out of the boys
than i thought

  still he held howell and rubush out
of the game brownsburg tied the score
pulled away and led - at the half be-
cause of the very obvious fact that the
substitutes greenbury and fletcher could
not stand the pace

  it was even obvious to hez rubush and
ab howell who still smarted from the
memory of their last tricking at the hands
of brownsburg they stormed in upon
conny between halves

   whats the matter with our sons wed
be winning this game if they were in
there

  conny grinned

   ive been sort of hesitating because of
their hearts

   ab howell scrawny little runt of man
flushed he tip-toed and shook his fist
under connys nose

  you put screech into this game and


basketball stories

dont you let him come off the floor until
he has to be carried off were going to
win this game im foundered on these
brownsburg monkeyshines

  and that goes for me too hez said

conny goodspeec poured in-
spiration and instruction into his
players a revitalized redding team came
came from its dressing room hez rubush
and ab howell gave their sons final en-
thusiastic slaps upon the back redding
had never seen such paternal concern a
wave of confidence surged inexplicably
through the fans as the redding players
dashed into position

  the regular combination of harben
rubush and howell clicked swiftly for
baskets brownsburg held its lead by the
narrow margin of one point flying feet
beat a roaring tattoo upon the hardwood
floor five men dived at a loose ball
guards clung to their men like leeches
redding took the ball on an out-of-bounds
slippery helms threw it in the floor
seethed with determined athletes as red-
ding fought for an opening and the walls
echoed blast on blast of cheers as rubush
finally drove in and pushed one over the
rim to give redding a one-point lead but
brownsburg pulled even a minute later and
the third quarter ended -

  redding players were tired dog-tired
they dropped to the floor relaxed and
breathed hard

  woody harben gasped weve got to
beat them in the regular playing time well
fold if we have to go into another extra
period

  the game was on again

 the voices of hez rubush and ab
howell screamed out above all the rest
every visitor saw the familiar butts of
many a brownsburg jest aroused to fight-
ing pitch brownsburg had momentary
visions of years of trickery boomeranging
upon it at last but whatever the real or
fancied shortcomings of the brownsburg-
ers they did not lack courage their team
fought desperately for what might be the
final triumph over redding in a long
time

  for redding harben helms and fran-
cisco who had been in action every minute
of both games were playing on nerve alone

  the scoreboard showed six minutes to
play five four

  with throats parched lungs burning and
muscles sending out pleas for mercy they
battled on brownsburg in a burst of
desperation still could not shake therm

  the score - - four minutes
three two one

  woody harben soared high to intercept
a pass he looked for a mate to hook it to
there was none he feinted a long shot
and drew in his guard calling upon his
last ounce of energy he reversed and went
for the basket in a lightning dribble he
went under and shot and collapsed

  the ball rimmed the hoop twice then
sank for two points

  redding-  brownsburg 

  and the gun ended the game

conny goodspeed fought his way
through the wildly milling crowd to
coach lawrence of brownsburg

  lawrence he said in half an hour
there will be supper for you and your squad
at the milk  honey and there are
rooms for you at the howell house you
cant go home on a night like this

  lawrence stared

  well ill be-

  conny was gone to join his players in
the dressing room when they came out
they found kitty and col brewington

  conny kitty exclaimed what a day
we beat brownsburg and were going to
get our highway too did you know col
brewington was a member of the state
highway commission 

  sure grinned conny im already
booking home games for next winter

  it slowly dawned upon kitty that maybe
connys purpose in having cedar falls and
col brewington present was to let the
colonel see how badly redding needed a

glory

by ted fox

a complete college hardwood novelet

college-kid snootiness smothered steve martin grandstanding hoop-lizards
looped him into the scrubs still those hardwood racketeers couldnt
smash that one-man offense-steve martin was the comeback kid himself

the atmosphere in the hempstead
dressing-room between the halves
of the basketball game with stockton
college was tense and expectant steve
martin sat on the floor back propped
against the angle formed by two rows of
metal lockers his broad and usually
good-natured face was flushed and wet
with sweat he wore a red and blue
sweater inside the sweater his long whip-
corded body steamed from the violent ex-
ertion of bucking through the first half not
only the five huskies of the stockton squad
but the four other members of his own
team as well

  steve looked steadily at his big hands

which clenched and unclenched in his lap
between his drawn-up legs he bit his lip
a dark scowl puckering his mild blue eyes
at the corners steves anger was slow to
rise but it was reaching the boiling point
this night

  raising his head he looked around the
dressing-room at his team-mates who were
sprawled out on the benches in various po-
sitions of rest they were a tired-looking
lot there was baldy jones the other for-
ward bugs bailey and hap taylor the
two guards scudder todd and the rest
of the substitutes and finally glenn
howard

  steves gaze came to rest on the lanky




basketball stories

form of the hempstead center there was
a satisfied look on howards smug face
that made steve squirm there was plenty
of reason for that look steve thought bit-
terly all through the first half of the
game glenn howard had done his best
to make steve martin look like a tramp
and he had almost succeeded

  steve had fumbled the ball continually
to the crowd of hempstead students and
fans ringing the court it had seemed to be
his fault it was an off night for their
star player and they rose on their feet and
groaned each time he missed a shot at the
basket or lost the ball to an opposing player
even the stockton players were surprised
their coach had hammered it into them
continually that steve martin was their
biggest menace but he wasnt glenn
howard had been the big man of the first
half he was everywhere at once fight-
ing hard to keep the stockton score down
despite the all too apparent handicap of
having steve on the floor with him that 
was the impression he gave the onlookers
steve and baldy and the rest of the team
knew different

  they knew that glenn howard hated
steve martin they knew that howard
was doing his best to drive steve off the
team his passes to steve had the un-
necessary driving force of a cannon-ball
and were just a fraction out of reach or
misplaced so that steve would have to
stretch and consequently be off balance for
a toss at the basket howard would relay
the ball at moments when steve was
hemmed in by stockton players he was
clever about it he didnt overdo it or
make it obvious neither did he take any
chances of losing the game letting up on
steve when they fell behind clamping
tightly down again when they led by a
safe margin

  as he sat there between the halves
steves one wild desire was to get up and
beat the tall centers face into a pulp he
deserved that and more but steve knew
he couldnt do it-not now at least jones
bailey taylor and the rest were all how-
ards friends they would say that steve
was trying to put the blame on howard
that he had done it in a fit of anger at his
own failures no one would believe the
truth even if it were told them and though
steve didnt care what else was said of

him he would rather go down quietly than
be called a bum sport

  howards gaze met steves how do
you feel martin he asked you couldnt
seem to get going last half anything
wrong 

it was said pleasantly enough glenn
howard was always outwardly pleasant
to steve when others were around the
hate the big center felt showed only in his
smouldering eyes the faint sneer on his
dark handsome face and the condescend-
ing manner of his speech and attitude this
feeling of animosity had popped up at
the first day of practice months ago and
it had grown in intensity ever since steve
couldnt account for it he seldom saw
glenn howard off the basketball court ex-
cept occasionally at classes howard be-
longed to an entirely different crowd from
steves he was the big man around the
campus president of his class and cap-
tain of the basketball and football teams
his fraternity was the richest and most
sought after in the college he was popu-
lar with the girls not so much as he
thought because of his good looks as be-
cause of his big car and wealthy father
who owned most of the town of hemp-
stead and was head of the huge howard
lumber mills it was old man howard
who had given the gymnasium to the col-
lege good publicity for the howard in-
terests as everyone knew but the colos-
seum was one of the largest in the county
and because of its size the conference tour-
naments were held there rather than up
state

  steve belonged to no fraternity few
co-eds looked his way more than once he
wasnt president or captain of anything
and his father was a campus janitor and
they lived in a little shack across the tracks
on the other side of town that was the
only possible reason for glenn howards
hating him steve thought howard
wanted steves place on the team for
chic scudder a friend and fellow fra-
ternity brother with chic in at guard
that would make the clique of five active
players from the same fraternity house
complete

  but steve wasnt going to be pushed
onto the bench without a fight he opened
his mouth to answer howards question
gangway

clenched teeth a white line between parted
lips and at that moment king davis their
coach strode into the room and slammed
the door shut behind him

  steve slowly relaxed as the thin gray-
haired man walked to the center of the
floor and stood there looking down at his
charges in stony silence steve saw the
tightness at the edges of the coachs mouth
and with a sudden wave of relief realized
that king hadnt been blind to what was
going on out on the court during that first
half

  king davis just looked at them for a
full thirty seconds his sharp eyes flitting
from face to face lingering on no one more
than another finally he threw up his
hands in a hopeless gesture

  ive seen personal grudges carried into
politics prize fights and professional games
of all kinds he half shouted but id
hoped never to see it crop up in a college
team of my own or to such an extent as
it did on that court tonight im ashamed
of the whole lot of you

  he paused to let his words sink in and
steve squirmed his face turning a shade
redder all of a sudden steve felt like
teachers pet or like a schoolboy who had
been saved from the big bully by another
instead of winning his battle on his own
and to make matters worse it was gener-
ally known that his  father and king
davis were old friends and that the coach
had been the one to persuade steve to come
to hempstead and play basketball

  i dont know what its all about davis
went on without lowering his voice and
i dont want to know but this im telling
you its got to stop

  steve shot a glance at glenn howard
the dark-haired center was looking at his
feet in a bored fashion but his head came
up with a jerk at kings next words

  if it doesnt stop the coach growled
angrily im conceding this game to stock-
ton and withdrawing you from the con-
ference for good and all remember that
and get this through your heads every
last one of you im not bluffing

  he glanced at his watch then look-
ing straight at glenn howard

  now get out there he snapped and
if you can act like men

  as they trotted out onto the court under
a battery of lights hanging down from the

for glory	

steel girders under the roof tier upon tier
of hempstead students rose up from their
seats with a mighty roar pennants
waved caps soared into the air gray-
bearded professors yipped and danced like
the college boys around them their wives
shouted and yelled with the co-eds dotting
the stands in a riot of red and blue colors

  leaping out onto the court the cheer-
leader directed the wild tumult into an or-
ganized cheer for the team scarcely had
it died away when across the big colos-
seum came a thunderous roar from the
stockton fans as their team filed out on
the playing floor the stands were in a
fever of excitement this was the final
game of the conference the winner of
tonights tussle would go up against pow-
erful state to decide the championship
the score stood stockton  hemp-
stead 

as he walked out onto the floor steve
wondered what course glenn how-
ard would follow not that king davis
had given him much choice in the matter
but howard was bull-headed and used to
getting his own way in things steve
wasnt so sure he would give up easily

  spreading out over the floor the two
teams took their positions guards back
forwards well up and the two opposing
centers facing each other with the referee
standing beside them basketball poised in
his hand

  the whistle shrilled and the referee
tossed the ball into the air glenn how-
ard leaped up a fraction of an inch higher
than his stockton opponent and tipped the
ball aside steve caught it on the run and
relayed it to baldy baldy took it and side-
stepped seeming to elude a stockton for-
ward and slamming it back to steve who
caught it on the fly and all in the same
motion looped it into the basket

  a wild cheer burst from the hempstead
side of the colosseum then faded as the
referee brought the ball back onto the floor
and put it back into play the goal was
not good this time the stockton center
reached it first and tipped it to his for-
ward who caught it high and whirling in
mid-air shot it dowrn to his fellow-forward
who had run around steve and was in scor-
ing position the ball soared up and for
a moment as it rimmed the basket looked


basketball stories

like a goal but a deep groan rose up
from the stockton fans and it dropped
over the outside into play again

   bugs baily caught it and faked a short
pass to hap taylor he made two steps
on a bounce then relayed to jones jones
ducked a stockton forward shot it down
the floor to howard who sank a long one
from near the foul line the score now
read stockton  hempstead 

   steve made another field goal a second
later but the advantage was quickly lost
when the stockton center sank an easy one
from directly under the basket the fans
were up on their feet cheering with the
stockton rooters calling on their men to
hold their lead and the hempstead fans
entreating their team to score the colos-
 seitm was in constant pandemonium

   after the first few plays steve had seen
that glenn howard intended to play a
square game they had buckled down to
business this second half but despite their
desperate efforts they couldnt seem to
close up the two-point gap then stockton
scored again and the tally stood at -
with only five minutes to play before the
game ended

   howard tipped the ball to steve on the
next play like a flash steve tossed it back
as howard went around behind his man
howard dribbled for two steps then shot
to baldy jones who whirled and hurled it
across to steve steve let it go over his
head the ball slapped against the back-
board with just the right amount of english
on it and dropped through the ring into
the basket

   with a wild yell the hempstead cheering
section leaped to its feet waving pennants
and hats two minutes to play the score
 to  three points to go for victory

  stockton took the ball next and in a
series of quick moves worked it down the
floor to the hempstead basket but in
his eagerness to make a goal a stockton
forward elbowed baldy jones and the ref-
erees whistle piped shrilly

  the free throw was made from the foul-
line and the markers on the score-board
were changed to read stockton  hemp-
stead  one minute to play

   steves arms and legs ached with weari-
ness his mouth was dry and every breath
he took parched his laboring lungs he
glanced around at his team-mates they

were no better off than he they had all
played straight through the game king
davis having made no move to put in sub-
stitutes

  glenn howard took the ball himself on
the next toss it was almost fatal he
whirled to shoot it at baldy but the op-
posing forward was sticking to jones like
glue a stockton guard and the center
were rushing howard from two sides at
once he bounced the ball glanced at
steve who was racing down the floor cov-
ered by a stockton forward then passed
it back to bailey bailey caught it as he
came rushing up dribbled it to the side-
line then hurled it with bullet speed to
steve who had moved around his opponent
and came into the clear to receive the
throw it was a high loop over the heads
of the stockton players they jumped for
it and missed by inches steve took it and
flipped it up for the basket

  it rolled half way around the rim then
it dropped through the net to the floor
and at that instant a gun boomed faintly
above the roar of triumph that burst from
the hempstead rooters the game was
over

steve pushed his way through the
cheering throng that came spilling out
of the stands onto the playing floor in
the locker-room king davis didnt say
much but he gave steves arm a squeeze
and he grinned when he did it and steve
felt a little better knowing that the grizzled
coach had read the handwriting on the wall
not a word passed between howard and
himself in the showers and later in the
dressing-room the other players looked
at him curiously then drew off to one end
of the room when glenn howard was
dressing before his locker

  but steve was used to that sort of treat-
ment by now in all the time that he had
played on the basketball team they had
never included him in their conversations
he wasnt their kind he came from across
the tracks from the mill section of town
and not for a second did they let him
forget it it wasnt so much bugs bailey
and jones and hap taylor and the rest
they werent bad fellows individually
but they were glenn howards cronies and
his fraternity brothers and howard was
their leader and whenever he cracked the
gangway for glory	

whip they would sit up and bark like so
many trained seals

  steve found his father old john mar-
tin huddled against a radiator in the
crowded lobby of the gymnasium pop
martin the hempstead students called
him he was a short seedy-looking man
of fifty gray-haired and shabbily dressed
in torn coat and trousers that didnt match
his seamed face was like a piece of old
leather he had watery eyes and a red
bulbous nose and a pair of walrus mus-
taches that drooped tiredly past the cor-
ners of his tobacco-stained mouth he
stood there fumbling his soiled cap a pa-
thetic figure in sharp contrast to the well-
dressed students and their families about
him

  the old fellows eyes lighted up at sight
of steve pushing through the crowd
toward him there was a strong bond of
affection between these two in the ten
years they had lived alone together-ever
since steves mother had died-there had
never been a harsh word spoken in their
little shack down on river street even
when his father came home from work
drunk which happened often of late there
was never any scene steve simply put
him to bed and in the morning asked him
not to do it again and his father always
promised to reform only to repeat the
process several nights later

  steve thought he got the stuff at kellys
bar it was his fathers favorite haunt
he drank himself senseless there two or
three times a week also at kellys he
made his bets on the hempstead games

  for that was another weakness of old
pop martin pat kelly fronted for a syn-
dicate that specialized in taking bets on
college athletics john martin had bet
consistently on hempstead football base-
ball and basketball games now for more
than two years and on the average he had
come out ahead enough at least to supply
himself with liquor steve had done his
best to stop it he had threatened kelly
with the police but the scar-faced saloon-
keeper had merely laughed in his face en-
raged at this steve had sailed in with both
fists flying and had promptly been slugged
and thrown into the street by two burly
bouncers

  it was only when his father had begun
drawing money from their savings account

that steve objected strenuously he had
finally been forced to change the account
into his own name so his parent could not
reach it there were eight hundred dol-
lars there when he reached twelve hun-
dred they were going to buy a farm out
in the county they had been planning it
for years

  steve pushed through the crowd and put
a hand on his fathers shoulder the old
fellow had his faults but steve loved him
none the less because of them john mar-
tin needed someone to look after him con-
stantly and the job had fallen to steve

  what happened out there in the first
half the elder martin asked querulously
you didnt go so good for a while
steve glanced over his fathers head at
glenn howard the lanky center was
completely surrounded by a ring of admir-
ing girls and boys from the university

  just couldnt seem to get going thats
all he said with a crooked smile no-
bodys fault but my own

  john martin grunted he knew bask-
etball and couldnt be fooled that easily
but he let it pass

  lets go home steve growled no
use hanging around here any longer
they moved toward the door steve
helped his father into a tattered overcoat
slipped his own leather jacket on over an
ill-fitting gray suit it was bitterly cold
out and they both shivered as they pushed
through the swinging doors into the night
air

  steve oh steve wait a minute i
want to talk to you i

  steve turned and peered back through
the frosty panes of glass at a slim dark-
haired girl in a coonskin coat who was wav-
ing at him frantically as she elbowed her
way across the packed floor of the gymna-
sium he held the door open for her

mary woods was the only girl on
the campus so far as steve was con-
cerned she was admittedly one of the
cutest looking co-eds on the campus and as
nice as she was pretty they were in the
same chemistry class and steve had come
to know her well he was in love with her
but that was his secret and he guarded it
well

  hello mr martin mary said as she
came out onto the gym steps heavens
	basketball stories

what a mob hello steve she smiled

  that was just like mary steve reflected
she was one of the few students on the
campus who showed his father any respect
and called him mister instead of pop
steve looked down into the smiling face
she turned up to him and his knees sud-
denly felt like water she always affected
him that way every time he heard her
husky voice or looked into her brown
eyes smelled the sweet fragrance of her
hair or the perfume she used he felt a
little dazed

  steve she said putting a hand lightly
on his arm wont you take me to the
party tonight

  steve looked at her uneasily what
party he asked

  why the one theyre giving for the
team she said you know up at the
fraternity house

  steve shook his head no i dont
know he replied slowly i hadnt heard
about it

  he saw the red flush stealing into her
cheeks the sudden anger glinting in her
eyes he remembered now having heard
king davis telling them after the game
that they could sit up a little later than
usual tonight if they promised not to break
training otherwise there had been a de-
lay in the tournament schedule and the
committee had found it necessary to put
the final game off until monday night the
team had come through a hard season and
king was wise enough to let them ease up

wait here mary said her voice throb-
bing with rage dont go away please
she started to go in but steve caught
her by the arm no he said dont
id rather not go that way

  dont be silly she cried glenn only
forgot ill be right back

  she was gone before he could stop her
he saw her cross the floor and talk earnestly
with glenn howard steve felt like a fool
but it was nice he thought to have mary
interested in him to have her want him to
take her to the party then he saw her
coming back glenn howard in tow

  hello pop the big center called as he
swaggered out onto the porch hows
tricks he swung around on steve be-
fore the elder martin could reply mary
says i forgot to ask you to the party to-
night guess it slipped my mind but youd

better come its informal so dont bother
to change your clothes

  and with that he spun on his heel and
re-entered the gymnasium mary stared
after him her small fists clenching at her
sides steves own fists were crammed
into his pockets where he could control
them steve knew that it hadnt slipped
howards mind he had excluded steve
deliberately from the party and that
crack about not bothering to change his
clothes glenn howard knew very well
that the best steve had was on his back at
that moment

  i cant understand how some people
can be that way mary said tonelessly she
turned with a toss of her dark curls and
took steve and his father each by an arm
but what do we care  the cars out there
somewhere lets be going

  as they drove away from the gymna-
sium steve glanced back and saw glenn
howard coming down the steps with some
of his friends they were laughing at
something he was telling them and steve
guessed what it was

  mary parked her roadster in front of the
fraternity house

  ive got to make a round of the fur-
naces john martin said as he left them
glad to have seen you miss woods ill
be waitin in the cellar steve come down
when you get ready to go home

the party was well under way when
steve and mary got there steve
helped mary out of her coat and hung it
beside his on a peg in the hall a stair
led up from the hallway into the upper
stories of the old brick and frame house
steve glanced into the library to his right
and beyond that to the dining-room then
mary led him into the sitting-room on the
left it was a huge room richly furnished
with sofas chairs rugs and paper on the
walls steve had never seen such rugs
before they were soft and deep under-
foot mentally he compared these things
with the cold linoleum and the unplastered
walls he was accustomed to at home

  leading steve to a sofa mary sat down
beside him the room was almost full at
one end the rug had been pulled back and
an energetic couple were wildly dancing to
music pounded out by a bespectacled chin-
less youth who sat hunched over a piano
gangway for glory	

in the corner on a sideboard were glasses
ice-bucket and a row of bottles smoke
curled up from a score of cigarettes the
rug was pushed back further and more
couples went out on the floor then baldy
jones asked mary to dance and steve was
left alone

  steve wished that he could have been
the one to ask her but he didnt dance well
and he hadnt dared for twenty minutes
he sat there on the sofa by himself no
one spoke to him no one paid him any
attention other than to glance at him with
a look that plainly said what do you
think youre doing here steve felt out
of place and he was out of place he real-
ized suddenly wishing that he hadnt
come

  steve saw glenn howard come in a
short while later and take a whiskey bottle
and glass from the sideboard steve
frowned wondering whether the basket-
ball player was going to break training
howard disappeared for several minutes
then came back minus glass and with the
bottle half empty leaning against the
sideboard he looked around the room his
gaze finally settling on steve there was
a covert smile on his dark handsome face
he seemed to be amused by something he
had done

  steve saw him leave the room and re-
turn twice more in the next fifteen minutes
then he forgot all about it when mary
came and dropped down beside him on the
sofa

  i must be getting old she sighed wear-
ily i cant keep it up as long as i used
to and im glad id much rather be
here with you

  that was sweet of her to say that steve
thought she wasnt just handing him a
line he loved her more than ever then
but he also knew that he was wasting his
time when he thought of them being to-
gether for always she liked him well
enough beyond that it could never go

  steve was suddenly aware that a hush
had fallen over the room and that glenn
howard was standing in the center of the
floor the tall center held up his hand
for silence steve looked at mary ques-
tioningly and she lifted her shoulders in a
negative reply

  ladies and gentlemen howard began
in high-pitched nasal tones in fair imita-

tion of a circus barker we have a spe-
cial extra added attraction here tonight
a dancer who will show us free of charge
how the boys and gals down in shanty town
strut their stuff he turned halfway
around and motioned to the piano player
professor-some music and as the be-
spectacled youth struck up a tune let me
present to you the one and only-pop
martin

  the piano player missed a beat but he
went on at an angry sign from howard
old john martin the janitor sidled into
the room and began shuffling about the
floor clumping his shoes in time to the
music his shoulders were bowed and his
hands were clasped behind his back he
was reeling tottering on his feet there
was a silly vacant grin on his seamed face
he knew he was being made the butt of a
joke but he was too far gone to care

  for a long moment steve sat in shocked
amazement too stunned to do anything but
stare he could feel the eyes of the whole
room bent on him marys hand had closed
about his wrist and was clutching it fiercely
he heard her gasp of dismay other than
the tinkle of the piano and the shuffling of
the old janitors feet on the floor there
wasnt a sound in the room no cheers no
handclapping it was an embarrassed silence
the faces turned to steve were frowning
a number were out and out angry for
once glenn howard had gone too far even
here amongst his own friends and cronies

in a daze steve watched his father stum-
bling about the room on wobbling legs
there hadnt been any smell of alcohol on
the old mans breath earlier in the evening
there had been no tell-tale bottle-neck
sticking up out of any of his pockets that
he was drunk there was no question but
where had he gotten it

  like a flash steve remembered the bot-
tle glenn howard had taken from the side-
board howard had taken it down to the
cellar and given john martin a number of
drinks with deliberate intention he had
struck a blow at steve by holding steves
father up to ridicule before this crowd of
younger people

  steve rose slowly to his feet he knew
now where his father had been getting his
whiskey he had been wrong about pat
kelly kelly hadnt sold the old janitor
	basketball stories

any howard was the one who had been
giving it to him steve was certain of
that he was certain because he knew
that his father didnt leave work here on
the campus until eleven oclock after he
had banked the fraternity house fires yet
the nights that he had come home drunk
he had been in the river street house by
eleven-thirty just the length of time it took
for the trip into town on the bus he had
had his fill then before he ever left the
college

  steve had often wondered about that
now he knew as he walked across the
floor past his father a blinding rage swept
over him and left his muscles taut as a
bowstring he stopped a foot in front
of howard glenn howard was laughing
and beating time to the music with his
hands but his grin slowly faded when he
saw the fury glazing steves eyes the
piano trailed off into silence

  theres some things money wont teach
you howard steve said very quietly
perhaps this will

  so fast that its motion was no more
than a blurr steves fist shot up and
cracked against howards jaw the sound
of knuckles meeting bone was like a pistol
shot in the tense stillness glenn howard
hit the floor with a crash and lay there
writhing

  steve stood over him big fists clenched
at his sides his face expressionless how-
ard half-rose onto one elbow his face
hand rubbed the side of his jaw as he glared
up at steve in sullen hatred

  you wont get away with it martin
he said in a trembling voice ill get you
for this if i die trying

  but he made no move to get up and re-
new the fight steve turned to face the
room no one stepped forward to cham-
pion their fallen leader with a scornful
smile twitching the corners of his mouth
steve took his father by the arm and led
him from the house as they started down
the walk toward the street mary woods
came running down the steps after them
she was pulling on her coat and she had
steves leather jacket clutched in one hand

  ill take you home she said avoiding
his gaze its late and the buses have all
stopped running

  they drove the two miles to town in
silence steves face was hard as granite

as he stared straight ahead through the
wind-shield beside him his father was
mumbling and chuckling to himself head
rolling loosely on his shoulders on his
other side steve could feel marys slim
body pressed against his when they
pulled up to the curb on river street steve
helped his father out then turned back to
mary she was leaning across the front
seat one hand on the wheel steve put
his head in the window to thank her for
the lift home

  im sorry steve she said before he
could speak everyone that was there
tonight is sorry it happened and i think
glenn is too he should be whipped if
he isnt

  steve felt her hand on his cheek saw
her face drawing close to his a pair of
warm lips touched his then she was gone
and he was left standing on the sidewalk
staring after her as the car sped down
the street and out of sight

  dazed steve took his father into the
house and put him to bed then he sat
down in his cold bedroom to think over
what had happened it was all a muddle
in steves brain he recalled the game
with stockton and the trouble with haw-
ard both there and at the fraternity house
that was like a nightmare to him he
closed his eyes then and thought of mary
woods kiss how sweet and tender it had
been and a faint smile softened the harsh
lines in his face

  he wasnt fool enough to think that it
meant she was in love with him she had
merely felt sorry for him and taken this
way of saying it steve was grateful but
his mind was made up when he finally went
to bed that night

the next morning he had a long talk
with his father he told his much
subdued and repentent parent of the long
downhill struggle he had had at college
ever since he had been there his friend-
ship with mary was the only thing he didnt
discuss

  tin not wanted out there he ended
finally hempstead is the finest college
in the country but its too snooty for peo-
ple like me im resigning

  his father looked at him shrewdly
you mean quitting dont you

  steve shook his head i could stick it
gangway for glory



out easily enough he answered thought-
fully but whats the use i dont like
horning in on a gang like that when theyve
told me as plain as they did that im not
wanted i hate people who push in and
im not going to do it thats all

  what about the game  the elder mar-
tin asked

  steve smiled im waiting until after
that he said i paid part of a debt i
owe last night as soon as trainings over
and weve licked state im going to hand
over the rest before leaving

  he took a blank check out of his pocket
and filled it in

  theres the whole eight hundred dol-
lars he said handing it to his father go
see the real estate broker tomorrow and
buy that farm youve had your eye on no
need of us living in the city after tues-
day you can get a mortgage for the bal-
ance

  pop martins eyes lighted up as he fin-
gered the slip of paper son he said
tremulously it may be the saving of me
if we can go away from here you and
i can work hard-start a little orchard do
some truck-farming yes sir ill see the
broker today

  and dont spend it on booze steve
warned his parent seriously or lay any
money on the game

  john martin wagged his head vigor-
ously im off that stuff from now on
he vowed you dont have to worry about
me steve i wont touch another drop as
long as i live

  steve put a hand affectionately on his
fathers shoulder same old story he
thought but pretty soon they would be out
in the country where the temptation would
be removed-where they could start all
over steve was eager now to get away the
only thing marring his vision of a happy
country life was the fact that never again
would he see mary woods

  steve spent part of monday morning in
the gymn shooting at the basket practic-
ing for the big game he didnt see his
father again until late that afternoon the
elder martin had taken the day off to make
arrangements about buying the farm he
was cooking an early supper when steve
got home he shook his head at the ques-
tioning look on steves face

  therell be a couple of days delay he

said while they fix up the mortgages its
a clear deed though so were all set

  they sat down to their meal steve felt
a little nervous he was always that way
before a game but he knew it would dis-
appear the instant the whistle blew for the
first play

  then abruptly without a bit of warning
the door crashed open and glenn howard
sprang into the room behind him crowd-
ing on his heels were twenty or more stu-
dents from the college steve recognized
the majority as being howards friends
but there were some from the other fra-
ternity houses as well but all of them were
the tough drinking crowd and there was
bugs bailey jones and hap taylor they
carried ropes their faces were scowling
and grimly cold

  steve and his father rose to their feet
and confronted the group which had drawn
up just within the door

  well steve asked what do you
want here

  howards lips curled back in a sneer
listen to him he growled youd think
he didnt know a damned thing

  know what  steve asked levelly spit
it out howard tell me and then get out
of here

  howard pointed an accusing finger at
the elder martin standing beside steve
you know damn well your old man placed
bets on tonights game

  steve glanced quickly at his father pop
martin was tugging furiously at his mus-
taches his eyes dowmcast

  well what of it steve said theres
no harm in that plenty of people do it all
the time

  sure they do howard shot back but
your father bet on state he claimed you
were going to throw the game so he could
make some money

      hats a lie

    a john martins voice rose to a shriek
it isnt howard shouted a man i
know heard you say it this afternoon down
at kellys

  i didnt say it

  wait a minute steve roared theres
a mistake here somewhere go ahead dad
tell them what you know tell them you
bet on hempstead if you bet at all

  the little old janitor seemed to shrivel


basketball stories

up at that and steve felt a slow freezing
around his heart

  tell them dad he insisted hoarsely
tell them you bet on hempstead not
state	 

  john martin shook his head helplessly
i cant steve its true i did bet on
state fifty bucks but  

  thats enough glenn howdrd shouted
him down see fellers he admits it
steve felt as though the bottom had
dropped out of everything

  let me explain old martin was yell-
ing i bet on   

  explain nothing baldy jones growled
youve said plenty as it is he turned
furiously on steve you cheap trash
youd throw the game just so your old
man could make some dough

  steves head came up with a jerk there
was something queer here he thought
wait a minute he cried i never
agreed to throw any game

  shut up howard snarled

  what arc we waiting for a voice
shrilled lets get em

  the whole college knows about this by
now howard went on harshly king
davis has jerked you from the team mar-
tin and the president is going to can you
in the morning but were not waiting un-
til tomorrow were running you out of
town tonight-now and if you ever come
back well tar and feather you and ride
you out on a rail

  no john martins fist crashed on
the table you cant do that listen to
me please listen

  too late howard yelled and with
that the rush began

  steve grasped a chair and swung it over
his head voice shattered with emotion
he shouted first one of you lays a hand
on my father gets his skull split open
well go but youre not running us out
not now or ever

  the charge faltered then came on again
steves chair swished down and splintered
spilling two of the crowd to the floor a
fist crashed against his jaw another
slammed into his stomach he lashed out
desperately felt his knuckles crunch into
flesh then he was borne back against the
wall and pinned there by the sheer weight
of his opponents as he went down
dragged to the floor by a dozen clawing

hands he caught a glimpse of his father
spread-eagled on the table a thin line of
blood running down over his chin from one
corner of his mouth

  the sight drove steve blind with fury
twisting wildly about the floor he tried
to break free it didnt matter what his
father had done that hadnt changed
steves feelings any regarding him but
he was powerless to go to the old mans
aid there were three men on his chest
one on each arm and two sprawled across
his thrashing legs

  a piece of cloth was stuffed into his
mouth and tied in place with a handker-
chief his legs were bound at the ankles
and again at the knees and his hands were
tied behind his back with cord that cut
and chafed the skin on his wrists then
he was pulled to his feet and propped up
against the wall one glance showed steve
that the same thing had been done to his
father bound and gagged they were
helpless to defend themselves

  all right glenn howard said you
fellows know what to do take them out
about ten miles on the pikeville road and
dump them the rest of us have got to
get back and get dressed for the game

  he strode across to the door and peered
out into the night no one in sight he
flung back over his shoulder better get
going you guys and dont let the cops
see you they might try and stop you

  steve didnt struggle as he was carried
out to several cars pulled up to the curb
in front of the house roughly they
dumped him into one and pushed his father
in on top of him two of the hempstead
students crowded in beside them three
more sat in front the remaining dozen
scattered for the cars strung out behind
doors slammed starters whirred

then abruptly a long black roadster
loomed into sight a block away steve
recognized its blurred outline and the sound
of its powerful exhaust with a roar it
sped down the block toward them tires
screeching as the brakes were flung on it
pulled across the street blocking the lead
car

  scarcely had it stopped when mary
woods leaped out and ran toward them

  steve she cried steve where
are you 
gangway

  steve shook his head savagely fighting
to spit out his gag she saw him then in
the back seat and running alongside
jumped on the running-board as the car
began making a u-turn in the middle of
the street

  wait mary cried pounding on the
glass window with one small fist it
isnt true steve i just heard what they
were saying about you and your father
i came as fast as i could i dont believe
it its a lie i know it is

  leaning forward straining against his
bound hands steve saw her white face
pressed against the glass the car was in
first gear moving slowly down the street
suddenly it stopped and the driver mo-
tioned to his two companions beside him to
get out with a nod they went around
and pulled mary off the running-board
twisting his head as the car leaped for-
ward again steve looked back through the
rear window the last glimpse he had of
mary she was struggling furiously in the
arms of the two hempstead students

  steve felt beaten in spirit as well as in
body only one thing stood out clearly in
his mind one fact he could never forget
mary woods had believed in him

  few words were spoken when the car
finally stopped and they were dragged out
onto the deserted country road a ring
of silent students stood about them in the
glare of the headlights their bonds were
cut and the gags removed then they were
alone and the cars were turning and speed-
ing back to town

  steve stared after their disappearing
tail-lights his heart like a chunk of lead
he couldnt see his father in the pitch
blackness but he heard the old fellow curs-
ing savagely under his breath bending
steve picked up their coats which one of
the students had been thoughtful enough
to bring along it was freezing cold and
there was a smell of snow in the air he
slipped on his coat handed the other to
his father and at that moment the elder
martins anger bubbled over

  the crazy blind fools he shouted fu-
riously if theyd only have listened to
what i was trying to tell them instead of
shutting me up and putting that dirty rag
in my mouth sure i bet on state but
i didnt say you were going to throw the
game

for glory	

  he paused to gasp for breath then he
went on

  when i placed that bet i winked at
kelly and passed a few remarks about how
hard you were goin to play nothing
wrong in that but the big crook took it the
way id hoped he would i done it on pur-
pose steve that syndicates as crooked
as they make em and i didnt have  feel-
ing about stringing em along as long as
i did it honest and i did do it honest
all i did was a little hintin

  steve groped for his fathers arm and
seized it go on he said tensely what
next 

  nuthin except that naturally the odds
went up to - in favor of state and-
and- he faltered-youre going to be
mad at me steve i bet the whole rest of
the eight hundred on hempstead to win
i did it quiet-like through a friend

  with a rush the wind whistled out be-
tween steves clenched teeth a broad
grin spread slowly across his bruised face
hope and joy swept away the feeling of
utter despair that had gripped him a mo-
ment before

  and there goes every cent we have
john martin growled without you
hempstead hasnt got a prayer of win-
ning

  they havent lost yet steve cried it
isnt only the money that doesnt count
so much its mary-shes believed in us
-its you-me-our reputation weve
got to go back to town so i can get in that
game weve got to show them that were
straight and not crooks as they think come
on

  clutching his fathers arm steve started
off down the road at a fast walk it was
a dozen miles or more to the college and
the game had probably already begun
their only chance lay in finding a farm-
house and begging a lift into town a car
passed them half an hour later going the
wrong way steve shouted at it but the
driver kept on going without slackening his
pace steve groaned it was getting late
and there wasnt a house in sight

then abruptly the head-lights of an-
other car swung around a curve and
flooded the road with light it was going
fast but suddenly it slowed and squealed
to a stop a few feet away there was an
	basketball stories

instants pause then mary woods ran
into the glare toward them

  steve she gasped drawing up in front
of him her eyes searching his face entreat-
ingly i broke away i heard them men-
tion the pikeville road now tell me
what happened whats it all about
taking her by the hand steve hustled
her into the car quick he said drive
us back to college and step on it

  mary swung the heavy roadster around
and as they raced through the dark for
hempstead steve told her the whole story
when he finished she let out a little cry
of joy steve could have hugged her then
but the speedometer read  miles and he
didnt dare

  you and dad get hold of king he
said to mary as they sped across the cam-
pus for the gymnasium and tell him the
truth tell him hes got to let me play
tell him i want to prove to everyone that
i wouldnt throw the game

  the roadster was still in motion when
steve leaped out and ran across the yard
and up the stone steps into the gymnasium
to his right as he burst through the door
he could hear the sound of muffled cheer-
ing from the colosseum in the empty
dressing-room he tore off his clothes and
pulled on his shorts and jersey and laced
up his shoes

  king davis gripped his hand in a vise-
like grip when steve entered the colos-
seum

  go in there boy he growled and win
this game

  boos and hisses rose from the hemp-
stead side of the arena at sight of steve
trotting out onto the playing floor to re-
lieve chic scudder the state team stood
at one end of the court looking at him
wonderingly to have an opposing player
hissed by his own fans was something new
to them glenn howard strode up to steve
angrily

  howd you get here he snarled get
off the floor we dont want any traitors
on our team its bad enough as it is
steve looked up at the score-board
which read state  hempstead  his
glance shifted to the stands there was
something going on there he could see
mary holding up her hands for silence
then his gaze came back to howard

  were going to finish this game he

said coldly after that howard im
going to push your face in

  a whistle shrilled and glenn howard
turned away steve took his position
they were seven points behind and there
was only ten minutes left to play that
state team was tough it looked pretty
hopeless at that moment

  again the whistle shrilled and the two
centers leaped high into the air glenn
howards finger-tips touched the ball first
and with a flip he tipped it back into
steves outstretched hands relaying to
jones steve eluded the man covering him
in time to take the ball from jones as it
came hurtling across the court waist high
one dribble brought him under the basket
and without slowing up he let it go over
his head a scattered cheer from the crowd
told him he had tallied

  steve made eight points in the first five
minutes of play it was-hard work but
he was fresh and deadly serious and he
went through the big state five like a cy-
clone he was all over the court dribbling
passing heaving the ball into the basket
from every conceivable angle his play
was contagious the tired hempstead
team rallied and gave him the support he
needed even glenn howard seemed to
come alive and forget his personal grudge
in the mad fight to win the game

  steve took the ball away from a state
guard snapped it to bailey who relayed to
jones jones was in a mess the next sec-
ond he was standing in the center of
the court state men all about him there
was only one thing for him to do steve
was covered so was howard he shot
for a goal

  he was off balance when he let the ball
go steve tried to intercept it but he was
a fraction of a second too late a state
guard picked it out of the air and shot it
down the floor to a teammate who looped
it into the hempstead basket for two more
points

  state  hempstead  and three
minutes to play

steve was fighting desperately for
those three remaining baskets but the
state team had tightened its defense and
was struggling just as hard to hold its ad-
vantage steve sank a long one from the
sideline as the ref tossed the ball to state
gangway

for the throw-in he wiped the sweat from
his eyes and glanced up at the stands
mary had done a good job she had told
the hempstead rooters what had actually
happened and the crowd had passed the
story up and back to the ones behind like
a flood of oil tossed on angry seas the
news swept through the stands even as
he took the defense and waited for the
referees whistle a sudden deafening cheer
shook the arena again and again it came
swelling roaring shaking the very walls
and the name they were shouting was   

  steve martin five more points
steve go to it boy you can get em

  the sound of that cheering put new
strength into steve even if howard and
the rest of the team werent for him he
thought mary and the fans and king
davis certainly were he made two points
in the next thirty seconds of play taking
the ball out of the state forwards hands
and dribbling the length of the floor for a
basket one more was added when a foul
was called on a state forward for elbowing
glenn howard howard sank the free
throw and the score stood -

  steve knew that an overtime period
would be fatal the state outfit was really
fighting now and it might rally and score
he threw everything he had into the next
play when the state offensive tried to
pass the ball in he broke up the attack by
snagging a state bounce-pass he drib-
bled two steps relayed to howard who was
in the clear then cut back into the center
of the floor angling toward the basket
howard had dribbled to the sideline he
glanced at the basket but it was too great
an angle for him to risk a shot he re-
turned it to steve in one swift motion
steve dropped it through the hoop for the
winning goal

  steve didnt hear the final gun before
he knew what was happening he found
himself the center of an excited mob of
wildly cheering students they were beat-
ing him on the back and shaking his hands
steve looked around for mary but he
couldnt find her anywhere finally he
broke away and went down to the dress-
ing-room

  closing the door behind him steve

for glory	

turned to face glenn howard who was
standing in the middle of the floor face
the color of putty behind him ranged
along the wall were his teammates

  all right steve said walking slowly
toward the waiting center here it comes
howard

  as he spoke steves first lashed up and
out glenn howard staggered back under
the force of the blow he recovered and
came in with a rush arms pumping like
pistons head lowered steve backed up
and then stepped in close and with short
stinging rights and lefts drove howard
back he flattened him to the floor with
a crunching right to the temple

  howard lay on the concrete floor of the
dressing-room finally he stirred and sat
up steve turned to find king davis be-
side him

  i think that about clears the slate the
coach said quietly get up now how-
ard and shake hands with steve here you
deserved this licking

  glenn howard rose painfully to his feet
i know i did he admitted grudgingly
im sorry martin i guess ive acted
pretty lousy

  steve smiled and held out his hand
forget it he said thats ancient his-
tory from now on

  they were all crowding forward then-
taylor bailey and the other players steve
stared dazedly around at the circle of smil-
ing friendly faces this sudden reversal
of feeling toward him took his breath
away still in a daze he hurriedly dressed
and ran upstairs to the great entrance hall
as he appeared a wild cheer burst from
the throng waiting to see him over their
tossing heads he spied mary and his father
standing by the radiator at one side of the
front door with a wave of his hand he
plunged into the crowd which opened up a
lane to let him pass

  mary came forward to meet him with-
out a pause or a moments hesitation she
flung her arms about his neck and hugged
him tight a yell of delight rose from the
crowd when she kissed him but steve
didnt care he was too happy at that mo-
ment to care about a thing other than the
slim dark-haired girl in his arms
basketball-its a game
guys game

by howard g cann

head coach of basketball
new york university

 it takes courage and loyalty and iron
 legs to score in this speed-burning
 sport a conjure-man of the courts
 tells how the games played-through
 strategy and hilarity and heartbreak to
 hard-won goals

        peeds the stuff in basketball of
course speed is no good unless its
hitched with straight shooting but the
t speed has to be there another requisite is
staying power it takes stamina to main-
tain a hot pace in the desperate last minutes
of a game when even the best-conditioned
players are running around with their
tongues hanging out it helps too to
know the opponents tricks-and be ready
to smother em

      about that last point heres one out of
    the book

      several years back new york university
    was getting steam up to meet fordham
    a city-title tilt in the ram gymnasium we
    knew it would be a tough one-and it was
    like money from home when our scout
    brought in a bit of priceless information-
    leary the ram floor-star the scout re-
    ported made a pratice of directing the play
    from back court seldom charging into scor-
    ing territory

      we took advantage of this knowledge of
    enemy tactics-and played a guard on the


basketball-its a game guys game

foul line to pick up all loose players coming
through

  it did the trick hamstrung the ram
attack and we were able to outsmart our
traditional opponents and win the game

  to get back to speed a lightning pace
a hammer-and-tongs offense with no let-up
-thats basketball as played by colleges
this year the games a hurricane from
whistle to whistle fast as the court con-
tests have been this year theyre even faster
therell be no chance for players or spec-
tators either to take a long breath the
step-up is traceable to rule  in the new
code which eliminates most of the center
taps and keeps the ball in almost continuous
motion its raz-
zle-d a z z  e  non-
stop

 speed is the
goading theme of
the court wars

speed is necessary
in shooting goals
in passing and re-
trieving the ball in
moving about the
court and even in
thinking there
must be no lost mo-
tion and a team in
order to win must
go at a fast clip the
full forty minutes

  and so physical
fitness is now as
never before the
factor that a player needs most to be
ready to engage in this sport today it
is true that he must have courage de-
termination a proper spirit of team loyalty
mental alertness and experience as well
but over and above all that condition means
nine-tenths of the game with the new
collegiate rules its of paramount impor-
tance and it will be demanded more and
more as the season progresses there are
no rest periods afforded by center taps as
formerly and its a case of go go go

  just as a chain is as strong as its weakest
link so a basketball team is as strong as its
individual players one weak link will
prove the chains undoing and one poorly
conditioned player will ruin a teams effi-
ciency there is no team sport like basket-

-basketball stories-winter



ball for demanding so much of its contes-
tants successful coaches the world over
attest to the absolute necessity of physical
fitness over and above other qualifications

  top-notch condition meant the success
of the undefeated new york university
court quintet during the - season
when this team ran through a schedule of
sixteen major games without a setback it
is true that they were experienced players
and had plenty of college spirit and all that
but i as the coach know that condition
mainly carried us through the series of
triumphs at home and on the road

that violet quintet was rated as a
second-half team playing faster and

stronger as the
minutes clicked
away and the going
grew heated be-
ing six or seven
points behind at
t h e intermission
meant nothing to
this outfit and the
spectators all along
the trail were quick
to discover this
fact the tougher
the going the
harder they played
and through it all
i knew that the
hours devoted in
the early winter at
university heights
to condition-
ing these players were paying dividends

determination and courage are

equally important attributes for basket-
ball players a member of any team ought
to remind himself at every turn that no
matter how hard he has to work at master-
ing the sport hell make of himself a better
player it comes easy to a few but for the
vast majority of candidates it means dili-
gent attention to the fundamentals of the
sport as for courage the contestant needs
it more than he does his shoes there is
no place on a court for a yellow player
and a candidate for any team must realize
that the least hesitancy or shrinking from
heated combat makes good playing impos-
sible

a team with five courageous players will

  howard g cann coach of the varsity
 basketball teams at new york university
 ince  has hung up a record of 
 victories and  defeats in - the
 violet went undefeated through a schedule
 of  games and a year later bowed but once
 -to yale in an overtime contest

   coach cann is perhaps the greatest all-
 around athlete in n y u history in 
 he was forward and captain of the basketball
 team in  back from the war a tackle
 or fullback he led the football eleven as
 one of the leading kickers in the east

   at the national a a u basketball cham-
 pionship tournament at atlanta in  in
 which he scored  field goals to help
 n y u win the national crown he earned
 the atlanta constitution trophy as the great-
 est basketball player in the world and he
 was named all-american forward


basketball stories

go lots farther along the road to champion-
ships and success a team of true cham-
pionship caliber always drives harder and
faster in the face of hardship and seem-
ingly unsurmountable obstacles that same
new york university five which i men-
tioned earlier in speaking of condition also
possessed unusual courage when playing
under stress i recall the men very well
sid gross and willie rubenstein were our
forwards joe lefft our center and captain
jim lancaster and hagan anderson the
guards they had a real test of courage
and determination in the closing game of
our schedule with the undefeated college
of the city of new york outfit when that
old collegiate pitfall ineligibility caused
us to lose captain lancaster for the impor-
tant tilt we had an unbroken string of
victories to protect and faced an equally
brilliant aggregation boaasting another ex-
emplary record

  well what happened-did the violet
lose its spirit and grit just because its cap-
tain and star was forced to retire without
leading the fight in his final college game
on the contrary the team played superb
ball wore down the opposition minute after
minute-and won playing as fine a game
of basketball as seen in eastern court cir-
cles in many long years i was plenty
proud of that outfit

  the mastering of the fundamentals of
the game plays an important role in our
system at n y u a team will not fail
as quickly and as easily if the players are
equipped with a thorough knowledge of the
fundamentals of individual and team play
a first-hand acquaintance with the games
fundamental principles will eliminate the
possibility of costly error in missing passes
handling the receiving of passes and in
shooting

  along with this there ought to be keen-
ness of thought and experience a real
court star cannot be made in a day a
month or a year and you will find that
hard work constant practice and the ex-
perience of many hard-fought games are
necessary

  i am not a disciple of any complicated
system of play we have certain set
formations especially on jump balls and on
outside balls but we have insisted for
years on condition a thorough training in
fundamentals a love of the sport and the

school and good fellowship among the

teammates

  the good of the team must be the under-
lying rule rather than the good of the indi-
vidual in our basketball set-up i have no
time for players who are selfish and who
are seeking personal glory at the expense
of their mates basketball is first and
always a team game and must be played as
a unit occasionally a player strays from
the fold and then a coach has a real educa-
tional problem on his hands

  newspaper publicity does not aid the
situation in this instance college players
are youngsters they enjoy headlines and
keep their clippings just as do the all-
american gridiron heroes the papers
publish news on individual high-scoring
records and often we come across a chap
who has his mind more on increasing his
own total rather than contributing his full-
est ability to the unit as a whole but this
is rare in colleges today the boys them-
selves wont tolerate such a situation long
and youll find that sort of individual get-
ting the cold shoulder from his peers
gradually he will see where he is damaging
the united cause and if he has honest con-
victions youll see a direct about-face

  one team thats hard to beat is the bacilli
squad no matter how a coach harps on
condition and physical fitness often the
team will bog down because a player or two
have overtrained or suffered an ailment
an epidemic of flu among ones players can
do as much damage as injuries to the bodies
by combat a perfect example of this
situation occurred last season at n y u
when we were deprived for several games
of the services of swede terjesen and
milt schulman two key men on our attack
ill and weak they lost their fire and zip and
failed to play up to expectations ohio
state at madison square garden in an im-
portant intersectional contest caught us in
this position and overtook the violet after
we had amassed a nine-point lead at the
intermission our replacements lacked
experience with the handicap of playing
a pair of weakened players we fell behind-
and the big ten quintet returned west
with a victory

but if courage cant beat the bugs it
can go down with flags flying-and rise
to fight again heres a story wash-
basketball-its 

ington and lee university produced the
outstanding basketball team in the southern
conference in - paced by big
bob spessard a six-foot-seven center who
averaged around twenty points a game the
generals made it hard going for every
team on the schedule a fast forward
bill borries brother of navys buzz
scored many points the w and l team
visited new yorks madison square gar-
den to meet a crack long island university
quintet

  the generals played against the black-
birds without the services of spessard who
was taken down with the flu borries was
also weakened by sickness but he saw action
in the game he put up a game fight but
he was unable to carry the burden of the
attack he was so weak that he could
hardly lift his arms and it was a real strug-
gle for him to get around on the court at
first the fans did not realize that borries
was ill and his efforts to retrieve loose balls
and shoot goals were booed and laughed
at then an announcement informed them
of his condition they saw what courage
and determination he was displaying in
every action and their belated cheers rang
out loud and long his playing that night
won an outstanding award of merit in the
heart of every lover of sportsmanship

  later in the conference finals washing-
ton and lee with spessard and borries
back in condition turned in a stellar all-
around exhibition spessard scored
twenty-five points single-handed-and
borries shone like his twin star

  it takes a thoroughbred to be a real
high-class basketball player with all the
crack teams in the collegiate circuit a
thoroughbred never knows defeat he never
quits and when all in and seemingly ready
to drop he recalls that his opponent is
probably a little worse off than he is and
the will power that is in his heart and body
forces him on hagan anderson and
willie rubenstein of recent violet teams
were perfect examples of thoroughbreds
these boys did not know the meaning of
quitting and their climb to the heights of
stardom in major college circles was
closely coupled with courage and grit

scouting of rivals has become almost
as prevalent in the court rivalries as on
the gridiron when we look over the oppo-

game guys game	

nents games we watch for defects in their
style of play and peculiar characteristics of
the players we model our attack and
defense accordingly this did the trick
we were able to outsmart our traditional
rivals and win the contest often opposing
players tip off their formations to scouts
by body movements and facial expressions
these little points are important to scouts
and coaches and correct interpretation of
a short shift or a quick wink may mean
winning the game

  last season middle west and pacific
coast teams visited eastern courts and left
considerable damage behind in the way of
startling upsets and one-sided victories
students often ask me if i have any
theories concerning the superiority of
players from those sections of the country
over our urban university teams the way
i see it is that the high school and college
boys in the big cities of the atlantic sea-
board are not active enough in their daily
routine i am particularly saddened by
evidence that good sturdy legs are fast
disappearing here in the east the boys
from the country colleges the big ten and
west coast in particular are better suited
physically for athletics by their modes of
living they spend more time in the out-
doors and walk farther and oftener city
life has softened the eastern college boy
and he takes the easy way around be it an
errand for the folks at the store or even a
trip downtown himself hell ride before
he will think of walking the distance i
may be wrong in this point but experiences
in the recent campaign seem to bear me out

  indiana ohio state notre dame and
stanford are four teams that come to my
mind in this regard last season these
institutions of learning and legs put teams
of six-footers  the court and all four
outfits outran the new york city repre-
sentatives dizzy if eastern colleges hope
to cope with this situation they must de-
velop teams with plenty of legs and good
fast ones in the bargain

  the training season-or lack of it-can
give a coach and his college plenty of
worry basketball normally is a winter
game but some colleges begin their prep-
arations with the opening of the fall se-
mester i have even introduced spring
duels for my squad considerable work
is spent on brushing up on fundamentals


basketball stories

and in developing of speed among our
candidates in a few cases coaches are
forced to await the end of the football sea-
son in order to get some of their material
as a rule it takes a football man two or
three weeks to get used to the court routine
and it has been my experience tliat no foot-
ball man was ever able to iasi more than
six minutes when the going got tough in a
speedy basketball game the pace gener-
ally has been too fast and is a great contrast
over the gridiron sport

basketball has its startling hap-
penings like any other sport many of
these incidents have added to a coachs
gray hair one of the most unusual-and
one of the most hilarious-i have had the
occasion to observe concerned a game
between the new york university and
rutgers university freshmen at new
brunswick n j a few years ago the
game was played preliminary to the inter-
varsity contest and a large crowd of violet
rooters were present in the stands to watch
the two games we had a youngster on
our frosh team named roy bowles who
was generally a clear-thinking lad in this
game bowles received the opening tap he
dribbled the entire length of the court and
sank a beautiful shot as the ball dropped
through the net he immediately turned on
his teammates and bawled them out un-
mercifully

  why didnt you fellows help me take
her down he demanded spiritedly

 they gave him a cold eye-and he
gasped in surprise and chagrin when they
told him that he had scored his goal in the
opponents basket as the game was re-
sumed the incident was overlooked the
tally did not appear important but at the
end those two points proved to be the mar-
gin of victory for the rutgers frosh over
the violet cubs

  once we were playing at the naval
academy at annapolis in the armory
which had a floor covered with battleship
linoleum they had a bad storm down
there and water dripped through the roof
and formed pools on the court an attempt
was made to dry the court and rosin was
applied to the bad spots but it was still
like trying to run on ice the court was so
slippery that the players of both teams
took numerous falls after five minutes

of the contest and with the score tied at
-all we decided to move the game to the
gymnasium then started a long hike
through the underground passageways con-
necting the academy buildings by the
time play was resumed in the gym the
new york players had lost their edge and
the midshipmen went ahead to win my
men were unable to get back their usual
poise in the new surroundings but they
came home with the satisfaction of making
history that day-playing one game on two
courts a mile apart

  a blizzard almost cost us another game
with lafayette college at easton pa one
season our train arrived fifteen minutes
after the starting of the game and we were
forced to pile into cabs and cars to travel
through the drifts out to the maroon cam-
pus our reserves were ready first and i
sent them in to start the game thrilled
with the idea of being in the opening line-
up the subs put on a scoring spree and left
the game after fifteen minutes of play with
a ten-point lead the varsity was sent in
at this stage-but the lead dropped off and
we were lucky to win the game after an
extra period by a single point the regu-
lars certainly were jittery and unassembled
and gave us more heart throbs than did the
idea of a blizzard

  at madison square garden where we
have played our big games for the past four
years they have installed glass backboards
to improve the view of the spectators seated
at the ends of the court we followed
suit at our campus gymnasium and there
too they have proved convenient to the
fans they also give our boys the practice
they need for the garden games it takes
a player a little time to judge his distance
with these new baskets because its mightily
distracting to see through them after a
while he becomes unconscious of the fact
that they are transparent

  one afternoon at university heights be-
fore the basketball team had started its
practice session an overambitious shot-put
candidate decided to get in a workout and
took an extra good heave of the shot it
sailed skywards and shattered one of the
glass backboards into a million pieces the
special glass was manufactured in pitts-
burgh where at the time of the mishap the
buildings were under about eight feet of
flood water and factories were giving little
basketball-its

thought to anything like work we had
to do without

  we drilled the rest of the week with only
one basket i was really tempted to per-
suade the shotputter to do a job on one of
the garden backboards so that we would
feel right at home down there however
he took his iron shot outdoors after that
and failed to attend subsequent court work-
outs

  startling and amusing incidents cross the
paths of coaches and teams we all con-
sider some of them downright serious at
the time but in later years when we look
back over these happenings we cant fail to
smile a bit and be thankful for them
the average training routine is nerve-
tightening enough anyway at times and a
good laugh is often worth losing a goal or
two

  the court clown while not always an
unmitigated blessing can contribute his
share to release training-tautened nerves
i have kept many an awkward gangling
youngster on the squad because of his keen
wit or clowning ability a team trained to
staleness is apt to break apart in the middle
of the season and the jester has his part as
well as the fast-breaking star forward in
putting a team up there in the champion-
ship rankings and keeping it there

basketball has added many attrac-
tive trimmings the game is far dif-
ferent than the one originated by dr
james naismith in  at springfield
the original rules-thirteen in number-
called for a couple of baskets or boxes
about fifteen inches diameter across the
opening and about fifteen inches deep sus-
pended one at each end of the grounds or
court about ten feet from the floor the
number composing a team depended upon
the size of the court area but it was per-
missible to have from three on a side to
forty

today fifteen rules with many subdi-

game guts gamei	

visions and added notes covering fifteen
printed pages control the sport and the
rules specify definitely that the game of
basketball is played by two teams of five
men each  

  but outside of these structural changes
in the conduct of the sport there are
changes in the uniforms of the players the
size and type of gymnasiums the intro-
duction of various systems of coaching
special types of flooring glass backboards
a new ball boards of approved officials
committees of regulation and each reason
an attempt to codify the sectional interpre-
tation of the rules

  today thousands play the sport in every
corner of the world college club and
military organizations have carried the
sport to distant lands and the game earned
international recognition with its inclusion
on recent olympic games programs in
berlin

  schools and colleges clubs and business
organizations that are unable to field foot-
ball and baseball teams experience little
difficulty in developing interest in basket-
ball

  and thousands upon thousands are sit-
ting in attendance at basketball games
today midwest and eastern college games
have attracted anywhere up to  for a
single game in recent seasons last winter
 attended the twelve nights of
double-header basketball arranged at madi-
son square garden in new york city

  the sport has made great strides it is
up to the coaches and players to keep
abreast of the changes it is fatal for a
coach or team to remain behind the times
in regard to styles of play and systems
the youngsters who make up our squads
demand the best type of instruction and
coaching and we coaches have a real duty
to perform in seeing that this is available
at all times we hope to do our duty- to
a grand sport and the fine lads who follow
it
razzle-dazzle racketeer

by william r cox

 those razzle-dazzle danver hoopsters were sure-fire bets to cop the
 conference crown-til coach tip colson sold em down the river to make

                              a gamblers holiday

                  a novelet of the hardwood court

andy derrick groaned there
they go

- the tate center pivoted and passed
to a running guard the guard stopped
dead in his tracks a tate player put a
block on jerry depew and sam pavelli was


picked off by the center the tate guard
passed swiftly to elmer madden give it
to elmer of national fame the great
tate forward dropped the ball through the
hoop with great nonchalance

  andy said thats  to  against with
razzle-dazzle racketeer



two minutes to go if we can only break
loose with that number  play  

  tip colson said tate is too good
they were scrambling for the ball the
referee gave danver an out down in tate
territory jerry depew passed it to abe
skivak and ran swiftly around his guard
abe bounced to pavelli who dribbled
pivoted and shot the ball back to depew
the tate team gathered down below the
black line

  depew faced the five-man defense and
hesitated a tate guard came out and
towered over him arms waving jerry
passed desperately back to gil mandeville
tate maintained its solid defense and the
gun barked ending the contest danver
rooters were dismally silent in the big
gym

  tip colson said well we held them
to the narrowest margin of any team this
season you cant beat a team with elmer
madden in there

  andy derrick heaved his stocky frame
off the bench and said bitterly so hell be
back next year and good old addison
ashley tells me next year is our last
chance	x

  tip colson said in his lordly manner
ill think of something well come
through andy count on it i never ad-
mit failure

  you just had one pointed out andy
disgustedly

  he plowed through the milling crowd
and left the building he knew that tip
colson would go in and soft-soap the boys
and dish it out to director of athletics
ashley that was tips specialty

  andy derrick was assistant to colson at
basketball assistant to the baseball coach
and general handy man of sports at dan-
ver university he was a compact young
man of medium height who had been a
thoroughly competent athlete in his day
he had shoulders of unusual breadth and
long arms which swung loose when he
walked he was mild-mannered and
blonde and his round face wore an eternal
expression of surprised interest

he went into the coffee cup and
found annabelle ransom waiting
patiently he wished that annabelle had
graduated so that he could take her down
to trotters for a beer it was comfort-

able in trotters the beer joints in
bounds for danver co-eds were littered
with students andy felt old and out of
place among students he was twenty-
eight

  annabelle had blue eyes which were
sometimes black her lashes were long
and curly ier hair was brown and un-
bobbed she wore disturbing sweaters
and short pleated skirts and sensible shoes
her speech was pert and colloquial but
andy often had the disturbing suspicion
that she was far cleverer than he she
was a senior at danver

  she said hiya old man dolorous t
see by your expression that i didnt miss
anything

  they did it to us he admitted they
played us for a lead and then held us in
when we were ahead we couldnt stall
tip colson again said annabelle
the great colson and his magnificent ges-
tures gamble and win says colson fight
fight fight boys and victory will surely be
ours

  aw-tips all right he has good
teams hes a spell-binder but it works
most of the time

  oh yes tips lovely said she and
youve got next season to make good and
then youll be sent to good old siwash while
i stay here at danver working in the lab
and doing my pg and youll meet some
little blonde with big eyes and no brains
and marry her

  thats an idea said andy one that
wont be heckling me all the time

  and youll be assistant to someone all
your life youre a better coach than any
of them but youll always be the heel said
annabelle

  aw-im no orator growled andy
i give em the plays and let em go the
kids dont want that stuff these days
but it impresses the powers that be
said annabelle sweetly witness your
pal tip

  tips all right repeated andy stub-
bornly

  annabelle dug into a chocolate fudge
sundae with whipped cream and maple
walnuts and said well you big tramp
i hope you miss me when youre gone
because the skids are certainly greased for
you and tip

i dont know if ill miss you or not
	basketball stories

said andy you eat many of those things
and youll lose your shape

  tip colson came in and stalked across
the room to the booth in which they sat
his curly black hair glinted in the lights
his square jaw jutted and his sports en-
semble fitted him like the paper on the
wall tip always looked like something
right out of esquire

  annabelle youre beautiful he said
sinking into the seat opposite her

  i wish andy could think up original
things like that said annabelle demurely
andy glowered at her but tip seemed ob-
livious of the irony

  he said ive just been figuring it out
andy we lose camp and fried and wil-
son that leaves us jerry depew skivak
pavelli mandeville and levin for the first
squad theyre pretty good but they
cant beat tate now what we need is
one man a star about whom we can build
an offense we gotta score and score and
keep on scoring to beat tate we must
have a man to offset elmer madden
you got something there tip said
andy where we gonna get him

  we will have to develop him we will
have to find someone and go to work on
him it wont be easy andy but we
must do it or lose our jobs he added
anti-climactically

  well said annabelle sweetly all
these boys have two arms and two legs
why shouldnt one be as good as another
good coaching should certainly be the an-
swer

  nuts said andy when we get em
they either are or they aint we can pol-
ish em but thats about all

  fine polish youd give a boy retorted
annabelle youd be more likely to
scratch

  tip said i wish you could play sweet-
heart youd at least look good out there
in a suit look i got to see a man about
a pony see you later

  he gave them his best smile and saun-
tered out not appearing to hurry but mov-
ing rapidly his tall graceful figure
passed through the door

annabelle said you think he was
kidding about that horse business i
saw him with little davey again yester-
day

  yeah tip even thinks he can beat the
ponies said andy worriedly he never
concedes defeat thats fine stuff when
youre competing but its no good for
coaches you have to look ahead

  my fine-feathered friend you are indu-
bitably correct said annabelle and
now i will go home and sleep and you will
go down to the abominable trotters and
get full of beer see me tomorrow will
you

  probably said andy i generally
do

  he watched her trim figure swing out
of the shop and sighed gustily he paid
the check and wandered down toward
trotters he had a sickening premoni-
tion of impending calamity beer he
thought might dispel it

  little davey corbin was at the bar he
was a dapper man dressed in the fashion
which ten years ago was termed collegi-
ate he had for a couple of years made
a good living gambling with and for dan-
ver students so far the authorities had
been unable to do anything about him due
to the fact that he seemed honest in his
dealings

  he moved close to andy and said have
one on me kid tough luck tonight
yeah said andy that madden
was too good

they sipped at the amber liquid little
davey said i know a kid can play bas-
ketball about as good as that madden guy
you wouldnt kid a fella would you
said andy

  he played over at harpendale high a
couple years back said the gambler
didnt have any dough so he went back
to the farm lives with his mom out on
route  sells eggs for a livin i hear
he come into some dough lately though
maybe hed be interested in cornin to
school here

  what is this davy a frame said
andy suspiciously if youre trying some-
thing on me  

  the gambler looked injured he said
look im loyal to danver aint i i
got a good lay here why should i phony
up on you im givin you a steer this
cantwell kid is good i seen him play
with a church team

  so even the church teams bet said
andy well whats the catch
razzle-dazzle racketeer	

  i hear tates after him said davey
they give plenty scholarships over there
with him an madden theyd be in line for
the olympics in a couple of years

  whats in this for you davey said
andy

  the gambler finished his beer he said
route  near harpendale you can take
it or leave it andy id like to see dan-
ver get a break it wont make me or fin-
ish me either way youll like this kid
hes your kind quiet y know seri-
ous you better see him

tip colson and andy shared a cou-
ple of rooms just off the campus the
next morning andy said dave corbin
gave me a lead on a basketball star last
night you know corbin pretty well
what do you think

  tip yawned and stretched he said
davey knows his sports but its prob-
ably another bum steer why dont you
check on it

  youre the schmoozler said andy
you better try it

  naw im sick of runnin around after
schoolboy wonders you go ahead andy
we got one scholarship to give out if he
looks all right offer it to him

  andy got out his small coupe it was a
cold day in the country he drove over
frigid roads to a small farmhouse on route
 there was a rural free delivery box
which bore the name cantwell andy
went in and knocked on the door

  a pleasant faced woman smiled at him
when the door opened andy grinned back
and said im looking for young cant-
well

  charlie hes inside studying said
the woman come right in sir

  andy went in and said im andy der-
rick from danver university

  a red-haired youth came into the room
and said ive seen you at games mr
derrick plow are you

  he was indeed similar to himself andy
saw he had the same breadth of shoul-
der the same length of arm he even had
the same hesitancy of manner and his
smile was an amiable reflection of his
mothers andy liked him at once he
said

  i hear youre quite a basketball player
cantwell

  people call me eggs grinned cant-
well yes im all right i guess i mean
-well i was high scorer every year i
played

  well we have a scholarship open at
danver said andy he chose his words
carefully of course youd have to pass
stiff entrance requirements and we cant
give you much just a room and tuition
and a job we dont have any of those
things where you jump over a matchstick
and collect bets but we have a good
school nice bunch of boys and a pretty
good basketball team if you can make
the grade wed like to have you

  i always wanted to go to danver said
young cantwell id-if i could make
the grade id like to ive been studying
figuring to enter the sophomore class if i
got a chance to go to college and im in
good shape for basketball

  ill put your name in said andy
dont listen to anyone else now will
you 

  you mean from other schools i
wouldnt pass up danver for oxford and
cambridge laughed the youngster why
ive been rooting for danver teams all my
life mr derrick itll be a dream come
true when i actually get there

there was a vague doubt in andys
mind as he drove back to the college
it had all been too easy the cantwell
boy had been too willing too assured he
remembered tip colsons words another
bum steer he remembered that the orig-
inal steer had been from a professional
gambler he wondered uneasily how well
little davey corbin knew cantwell and if
there was the chance of any shady connec-
tion between them the youth had acted
almost as if he expected a visit from a
danver coach

  he thought of the slow smile and candid
eyes of the red-headed youth and felt
easier the open-faced son of an amiable
and pleasant mother he reasoned could
not be allied with little davey he drove
along swiftly he was late for a date with
annabelle

  he picked her up in front of the library
her nose was red from waiting in the
wind he said

  im sorry baby i was out getting me
a basketball player for next year
	basketball stories

  he related the circumstances to her
annabelle said

  little davey playing santa qaus
hes miscast in that role if you ask me
which you dont of course

  well maybe he figures on cleaning up
 the team next year said andy with
one real star well have a championship
combination

  little davey is a professional gam-
bler said annabelle his bets are sure
things he makes book mostly if hes
planning to bet on danver one basketball
player will have to be awful good to make
his bets sure things

  youre a suspicious babe complained
andy ill bet you think the spanish
war is a frame-up sometimes i have my
doubts about marrying you youll never
believe i was out with the boys

  and ill probably be right said anna-
belle and as for marrying and giving
in marriage if this eggs boy isnt as good
as you say there wont be any i dont
believe in absentee husbands and i wont
do my post graduate at siwash or where-
ever you wind up as assistant coach
there you go again said andy be-
littlin your future husband a girl ought
to have more self-respect

  a man ought to have more push said
annabelle sententiously show me some-
thing to respect wolf

  andy turned the car abruptly up a coun-
try lane and parked out of sight of the
road five minutes later the girl said
breathlessly well thats something but
its not what i meant

  itll do for now said andy grimly
straighten your hat

eggs cantwell made the grade
scholastically and morally and the
scholarship was his in fifteen minutes on
the floor of the gym he proved to tip col-
son and andy derrick that he could earn
it

  his handling of the ball his passing his
footwork were a revelation his endur-
ance proved to be remarkable they had
him shoot from every angle and every dis-
tance on the run off balance and set he
never missed

  tip colson said if he lives through
the summer our jobs are good for another
year at least hes as good as madden

all we have to do is build the rest around
him and keep attacking we cant miss
if youd mix a good defense with that
youd have something said andy sourly

  the best defense is a good offense
quoted tip you gotta gamble to win
andy

  so you say said andy how you
doin on those bang-tails seems to me
little davey is gettin plenty of your
dough

  what do you know about that said
tip sharply thats none of your busi-
ness

  okay toots said andy surprisingly
i was only kiddin dont get sore
colson recovered himself immediately
jie made a sweeping gesture of disdain
and said oh im out a little but ill
come back dont worry about me slow
poke you better gather some hay if youre
going to marry the sweet annabelle you
cant live on love

  yeah said andy i know it but
my jobs all right i just want to keep it
this team has got to be good enough to
get that conference championship

  its in the bag andy in the bag
said tip oft-handedly now that weve
discovered eggs cantwell

summer came and went so swiftly
that andy barely had time to miss an-
nabelle she came back brown and
healthy and bluer-eyed than ever andy
was almost sentimental at the train when
he met her she said

take it easy wolf you look as if you
loved me or something people will stare
he said will you please get into my
car and hurry up about it  i cant be kiss-
in you out here it looks lousy

  and unethical said annabelle okay
wolf heave-ho and heaven help the
make-up

  after awhile she said hows basket-
ball

  footballs got a couple of them but
the rest are workin out pretty regular
he said were not wastin any time
tips got them going good together cant-
well is the works

  hes good eh she said

  hes our basketball team said andy
so much so that i dont like it but there
you are i been coachin skivak and
razzle-dazzle racketeer	

depew on the side a bit just in case eggs
breaks his shell or something

  smart andy said annabelle youll
get by with a push from me

the football season waned as the days
grew shorter jerry depew and joe
corvil came back unhurt and were fitted
into the basketball picture depew and
cantwell were the regular forwards sam
pavelli copped the center post and gil man-
deville and sol levin were first string
guards joe corvil piggy betts orvie
littleton and a couple of other boys re-
mained as capable spares

  colsons flashy swift-passing floor-sys-
tem and his gambling brilliant breaks for
the basket were clicking perfectly with
eggs cantwell at the spearhead of the at-
tack tip even allowed andy to intro-
duce his favorite figure  maneuver a slow
breaking whirligig revolvement which was
certain to produce scores if given the time
the school watched a couple of practise
games and went basketball goofy

  they opened the conference chase away
playing haughton college tip sent them
on the floor with instructions to pile score
upon score as fast as they could to make
the total as great as they could when
andy objected that it wasnt necessary to
show up a rival coach tip said

  this is a championship team and i
want them to know it gives em confi-
dence

  sam pavelli got the jump and tapped to
gil mandeville eggs cantwell broke
around his guard with a burst of speed and
a double pass wound up in his capable
hands he scored from the sideline in
ten seconds

  the rest of the game was just like that
haughton followed eggs around all night
in hapless fashion and eggs alternated
with jerry depew in dropping the apple
through the hoop the final count was
danver  haughton 

  tip said theres your defense for you
how can they count when were busy drop-
ping them in

  andy forebore to point out that haugh-
ton was not tate

as the season wore on it appeared that
tip was right at the end of the first
half of the round with the first tate game

coming up danver had been undefeated
andy thought that they had also been un-
tested he worked quietly with abe skivak
when no one was watching he was afraid
something would happen to cantwell the
thought haunted him night and day

  annabelle said you ought to move in
with that kid and watch him night and
day he might fall and stub his- toe or
something

if he does said andy you can put
that hope chest in the attic for awhile
the night before the game he was in
trotters for his beer little davey said
to him 

  well i guess you aint quite ready for
tate yet huh andy

  who says so said andy sharply
well no one said corbin but those
guys are awful good they got experi-
ence on you i figure theyll take this one
and youll catch em next time then you
can play em off an cop

  for the gate eh davey what do you
think this is the fight game well take
em now and later too if eggs stands up
said andy dont think anything differ-
ent

  before they went to the train to make
the trip to tateville tip colson said care-
lessly well we might blow this one but
well get them later

  andy said nothing for the moment as
they were about to board the train he re-
marked casually i wonder how the bet-
ting is any odds

  even money said tip absently

 yeah how much you got down
asked andy

  not much i mean-nothing i dont
bet on my teams said tip severely you
know that andy

  yeah i just thought maybe youd
changed your style said andy

  he got on the train and found a seat
next to eggs cantwell in the back of
his mind there was a thought that if the
train was wrecked he might somehow be
able to save his meal ticket

the tate five were certainly of dif-
ferent caliber than the other teams
of the conference class was written all
over their stalwart frames not a man
was under six feet crimp magee and
elmer madden were two inches over that
	basketball stories

height chink latzo was four inches
higher the guards kamp and morrie
fortune were shorter and huskier than the
forwards but fully as quick and durable
they were champions with the demeanor
of champions

  latzo got the initial jump as usual he
tapped back toward guard but crimp ma-
gee took the ball after a short sprint the
guard switched running down court pa-
velli followed gil mandeville covering
latzo

 give it to elmer madden broke
quickly and circled under the basket going
clean across court sol levin followed
closely but could not get in front kamp
was down to the right

  magee shot the ball to fortune whirled
and put a block on depew eggs cantwell
diagnosed the play and broke into the alley
but fortune passed to latzo and the giant
center raised the ball over his head and
slapped a long one against the backboard
madden leaped high for the rebound and
dropped it in

  early cut by madden late cut by
kamp growled andy the circle down
under the basket by madden leads our
guard in and sets up latzos carom simple
stuff

  they use it a lot said tip well
stop it before next game

  why not tell eh how to block it at the
half said andy we can take these
guys

  let the boys go said tip theyll
learn the tate style tonight thatll be all
right

  andy pondered tip colson the gam-
bler they always win fight-to-the-bitter-
ender was out of character he watched
eggs cantwell

  the red-headed youth was far from
stampeded by the big tate machine he
was moving into the intricate pattern of
their play boldly breaking up passes spoil-
ing shots harrying the guards and hur-
rying the forwards fritz kamp a great
guard was hard put to it to hold him in
check

  eggs was counting too time after
time set plays from an out or offensives
from the foul line were smashed by his
quick-thinking speed the danver team
rallied around him nobly at the period
the score was tied at eight all

at the half it was tate  danver 
the squad seemed fresh and strong
in the dressing-room andy listened while
the silver-tongued tip dished out the
gravy

  youve done splendidly i never had
a team half so smooth so strong tip was
saying you are fighting a championship
team and fighting them to a stand-still im
proud of you boys

  he did not give them the block on the
center jump play he went on and on
telling them to fight and lauding them for
their ability to hold tate even

  andy moved among them quietly ex-
plaining to each that madden must be
checked or forestalled on his circle under
the basket that they must switch men and
take kamp out of the play and that some-
one must be set for latzos pass off the
backboard they scarcely seemed to lis-
ten tips oratory was never more magni-
ficent

  when they were out on the court again
andy said i tried to give them the stopper
for that jump play but you talked me
down

  theyre doing all right said tip
easy does it

  andy checked an abrupt remark and
turned back to the game the center jump
play was going again he reflected that
it was a mercy there wasnt a jump after
every basket as of old tate would have
run up a lead that no team could overcome
danver seemed totally unable to cope with
it elmer madden scored easily the
score became tate  danver 

  on the throw-in eggs cantwell took the
leather and dribbled downcourt single-
handed andy held his breath as the red
head bobbed about among taller tate men
like a cork at sea jerry depew squirmed
free and took a bullet pass pavelli came
down center took it from jerry and
pivoted eggs got free of kamp and pa-
velli snapped the ball to him eggs scored
on the run overhand

  again tate turned on the heat dan-
ver had no solution to the tricky offense
elmer madden spun about the court tak-
ing passes from every direction kamp
picked eggs off briefly and tate scored
again

  andy noted that the burly kamp was
handy with his elbows in close the offt-
razzle-dazzle racketeer	

cials appeared not to notice but eggs cant-
wells face was grim when he went to his
position

  eggs took a pass out of elmer mad-
dens hands and stalled briefly the team
went into andys favorite figure  one
man passing behind the other the ball go-
ing backward then coming forward as each
man ran around

  they worked it down nearer and nearer
with the big tate men futilely trying to
break it up eggs made the arc nearest
the basket gil mandeville gave him a high
pass kamp was close enough but eggs
backed and held the ball high flipping it
with his wrists he let his arms follow
through dropping them heavily the heels
of both hands caught kamp in the face
staggering him eggs grinned and danced
back to take his place

  tip colson said skivak go in for
cantwell

  abe skivak looking puzzled obeyed
eggs came off slowly reluctantly he
said

  we were just getting hot coach

  i dont like slugging cantwell said
tip sternly we play clean basketball at
danver

  color mounted in cantvvfells face he
protested but he gave me the elbow
coach

  that said tip loftily is not the
point

  andy made space next to him on the
bench he said to eggs forget that
junk kid tips graitdstandin for the
mob if you let those muggs push you
around youll never get any place

  tate was putting on speed skivak was
willing and strong but he lacked the all-
around brilliance of cantwell the period
ended with the score tate  danver 
andys hopes were sinking he wondered
if even eggs could overcome that lead

when the last quarter started tip
made no move to reinstate the dan-
ver star danver fought bitterly but it
seemed a question of time before tate
struck again andy moved over to where
tip sat expressionlessly he said

  how about putting cantwell back in
the ball game

  tip said i dont think so much of it
let him learn some discipline

  andy said quietly youre acting
queerly today tip like you didnt want
this game you better put eggs back in
there

  tip said youre screwy andy but
if you want him in so bad why its okay
with me

  eggs went back into the game danver
immediately clicked the score went to
tate  danver  eggs- exhorted his
mates and raged down through the entire
tate team to drop in another

  with one point to the good tate went
back to a five-man defense again and
again they hurled back offensives in their
territory with time running out eggs
set himself at midcourt and tried for a
long one

  the gun barked while the ball was in
the air it hit the backboard bounced to
the rim rolled around it hesitated briefly
then toppled outside tate had connected
 to 

andy was silent on the short ride
home he left the train and got out
his coupe and picked up annabelle they
drove out into the country road which was
their favorite by-path andy said

  somethings out of whack toots

  because you lost to tate she said
a one-point margin wouldnt indicate
anything very wrong

  tip kept eggs cantwell out of the
game for almost a quarter for a thing
he should have praised if the kid had
been in there he would certainly have won
the ball game

  maybe if youd scored again theyd
have gone on the offense said annabelle
shrewdly

  you know too much about the game
said andy listen baby im serious
ive had a hunch things were not kosher
all along little davey recommends me a
ball player im the fall guy-i hire him
then when he becomes the key man of the
team things happen like tonight i dont
like it annabelle

  annabelle said my hero hes getting
smart the lamb but i agree with you
wolf something is definitely and decidedly
lousy

  but what can i do wailed andy i
dont even know anything tip ranks me
here he could even have me fired i
	basketball stories

cant prove anything i dont even know
myself if im right

  annabelle said i see you need me my
wolf ill take over right away you and
me are now going to have a quarrel if you
dont mind

  about what said andy

  about nothing-as usual im going
to work on your charming roommate with
the marcelled hair it will be an experi-
ence

  hey nothing doing said andy has-
tily

  i am going to work on tip colson
said she firmly i am going to accept
one of his many invitations and i am go-
ing to find stuff out he is a very cagey
gent and it may take some time but
sooner or later he will talk hes the talk-
ing kind

  you cant do that annabelle tips
a louse with women i wont have it i
tell you said andy

  look lambie do you want to have
a real quarrel  or do you want to pull in
here and park awhile in case there should
be a long drought she said

  andy pulled into the familiar lane and
parked

danver snapped back from the tate
defeat and went its winning way
andy was electrified one day to find that
fate and an off-night had caught up with
tate and that the hitherto weak holbert
u had knocked them off the pay-off
would be the second tate-danver game
after all andy wondered how that figured
with little davey

  he missed annabelle terribly tip had
casually mentioned that he was seeing her
and that she was evidently angry with
andy about something and did andy
mind andy had snarled a negative reply
and gone down to trotters for more beer
than was good for him

  the night before the all-important game
he met little davey not entirely by acci-
dent he said

  davey i dont usually bet but i want
to lay some dough on danver to win to-
morrow

  i dont blame you kid said davey
with what andy took to be false heartiness
its sure pop

  yeah said andy i got five hun-

dred bucks here can you handle it for

me 

  whew said the gambler thats a
lot of tomatoes for an assistant coach to
be puttin out

  well i want to get married you know
andy said this game makes or breaks
me

why i thought tip took your girl
away from you davey said involuntarily

  you certainly know everything dont
you davey said andy ominously how
come you and tip that close

 why-uh-no i just happened to
hear you know how those things are
said davey vaguely none of my busi-
ness of course shouldnt have mentioned
it you got the five cs with you
here it is said andy and-if you
cover it yourself davey make sure you
can pay off or else i might get sore
ho not me im bettin on my boy
cantwell said davey

  andy got into his car and drove out
along the road which was his and anna-
belles in a few moments a figure showed
in his headlights and he stopped anna-
belle climbed into the car andy drove
rapidly to his parking place and cut the
lights he said

  give baby gee ive missed you
after awhile she said glad to hear it
did you know your boy friend drinks whis-
key and lots of it

  no said andy he never did be-
fore

  he didnt come through until last
night said annabelle he owes little
davey his shirt andy hes in a spot
where nothing means anything to him ex-
cept how he can pay davey the tate
game is the blow-off youre due to lose
tomorrow night i dont know how or any-
thing else but youre due

  andy said were sunk there isnt
one damn thing we can do we havent
a speck of proof we havent anything
hell probably just yank your star egg-
man at the crucial moment and no one will
be the wiser said annabelle you cant
go over his head he can outtalk you any
time hes got addison ashley eating out
of his hand the dean is his pal i dont
know what youre going to do andy

i dont either said andy but im
takin over youve done your share ill
razzle-dazzle racketeer	

probably garbage it all over the lot but ill
do something

  youre an awful mush-head wolf
agreed the girl but its about time you
went on your own it might make a man
of you

  tip breezed into their room late that
night smelling of alcohol andys temper-
ature went up at the sight of the tall smil-
ing coach he said

  got all the dough down

  what dough said tip cheerily

  the dough you and little davey are
betting on tate said andy throwing dis-
cretion to the wind in a rush of anger
let me tell you something you dirty
rat 

  tip colson said menacingly wait a
minute andy youre out of line

  ive been out of line with you a long
time said andy you double-crossing
punk youll play eggs tomorrow night
though youll play him and like it if
you dont ill so help me break every bone
in your thick head

  you never saw the day you could take
me derrick snarled colson taking off
his coat

  i never tried said andy but this is
as good a time as any

  colson plunged at him andy feinted
with his left and drove his right from the
shoulder his knuckles ached with the im-
pact colson staggered backward andy
threw another right and the bigger man
crashed over a chair andy said thats
just a sample if we lose tomorrow itll be
more and worse of it

  colson dragged himself to his feet his
features were distorted with rage and pain
as he said okay wise guy this finishes
you and me im gettin out right now
you dont say remarked andy
you better before i kick you out scram
rat

he walked the floor that night he
cursed himself for having lost his
temper and tipped off the fact that he was
aware of the double cross colson and
davey would certainly take steps now
upon impulse he put on his coat and walked
to the house where eggs cantwell had a
room he knocked on the door and the
red head opened it rubbing sleep out of
his eyes

  andy said go back to bed kid im
spending the night here im afraid you

might be kidnaped

  eggs grinned and said nerves got you
andy 

  no its the rats gnawing said andy
go to bed

  he slept in a chair in the morning he
had to go out for breakfast and then he
had to meet annabelle wthen she had
bawled him out for his hasty action he said
stubbornly

  i know i have no finesse but some-
things got to be done i havent got brains
but i got knuckles ill bust a couple may-
be but weve got to have that ball game
he was busy until an hour before game
time he went into the dressing room and
immediately looked about for eggs the
boy was not among those present

  he said to jerry depew seen eggs
today 

  nope said jerry he always is early
though he should be here by now
andy made his way among ball players
in various stages of undress and found tip
colson in a corner he grabbed the coachs
lapel and said wheres eggs

  how should i know shrugged tip
hes late

  andy said remember what i promised
you last night itll amount to murder if
anything happens to that boy

  youre acting very foolishly derrick
said tip coldly i know nothing about
cantwells whereabouts

  andy left the room he dashed down
the steps of the gym and jumped into his
coupe he swore at traffic tearing across
town he bounded up the steps leading
to cantwells room it was deserted the
youths belongings were missing

andy ran downstairs and found the
landlady she-said i guess hes left
he paid me off and took his bags

  was he alone demanded andy

  oh yes he didnt look too happy
but he was alone all right he walked
away said the woman

  when he had returned to the gym and
was slowly climbing the steps a girl came
out of the shadows and said

  ive been waiting for you wolf
whats the trouble

  cantwells sold us out said andy bit-
	basketball stories

terly he packed up and walked away
that cant be he wouldnt do that
said annabelle

  he did it davey paid him to come
here and paid him to pack in said andy
hopelessly when i blew my top last
night they went to work on the kid were
licked

  look andy said annabelle her
eyes were black in the dim light dont
quit will you youve been building for
just this go in there and make that team
fight give me your keys-i couldnt
stand watching it but dont quit andy
okay baby said andy ill play
along and ill still have my time with
tip and with little davey later
thats the big bad wolf she said
kissing him lightly sec you later

  she ran down the steps andy went
into the gymnasium and clomped to the
dressing room the team was waiting with
the hushed air of a group about to be ex-
ecuted andy said

  youve been double-crossed fellas
egg cantwells left school

  tip colson said why i cant believe
that

  you keep out of this warned andy
im taking this club over any objec-
tions

  tip colson was silent andy said col-
son generally makes the pretty speeches
but ive really got something to say ive
been afraid of this all season boys for
reasons i wont go into here and now ive
been training abe skivak and jerry depew
to switch into the game jerry will take
eggs assignments youve still got a ball
club

  and you got something more tonight
youve been sold down the river fellas if
youve got guts real guts that should make
you a ball jub you should go out there
and show them youre not a one-man team
will you do it

  they grunted and swore under their
breath and shifted their feet andy was
satisfied he said okay kids go out
there in high and stay in high ill give
you further orders from the bench

  they came to their feet as one man
tip colson was forgotten as they filed
through the door each one stopping to
briefly shake andys hand when they
were all out tip colson said

  you cant get away with this der-
rick

  no im doin all right so far said
andy want to make anything out of

it

  colson said spitefully go ahead boy
scout have your fun ill settle with
you later

as he went to the bench andy thought
ruefully that it would be easy to set-
tle with him later if tate won they
would both be out of a job and he would
be settled out of hand if danver won
tip would find some way to steal the credit
and fire his assistant he blew on his
bruised knuckles and promised himself a
time later come what may

  the whistle blew and the ball went up
chink latzo went right to work with his
center jumping but andy had given them
that one abe skivaks block on kamp
was a revelation of speed and deftness
gil mandeville left his position and fol-
lowed elmer madden closely enough to ac-
tually steal the ball under the basket

  danver went into the now familiar fig-
ure  andy was pleased to see that tate
still had to figure out a defense against that
razzle-dazzle even without eggs the
team looked good whirling in their short
circles jerry depew took it in the foul
circle and scored almost negligently

  maddens throw-in went to fritz kamp
who lateralled back to elmer the tate
star dribbled swiftly to mid-court and
passed to fortune abe skivak moved in
from nowhere and broke up the pass to
latzo jerry depew stole the leather

  skivak yelled set and jerry froze
waiting the danver team came down
like an avalanche four men into tate ter-
ritory jerry bounce-passed to abe and
ran back to cover

  abe lined to sam pavelli and checked
pa veil i bounced to jerry and cut back of
his guard jerry worked it over and short-
passed to abe abe scored easily

  again the tate offensive failed to click
andy said to joe corvil get in there
kid and stall tell the boys to hold that
lead walk the line and pass if they
catch you go back to work

  corvil the tall streamlined football end
went on the court andy put his arm
around pavelli as he came out and said
razzle-dazzle racketeer



youll be back in there plenty kid were
playin a new game tonight plenty of
rests for everybody and freeze that ball
get a lead and hold it its our only
chance with eggs out

  corvil walked the line with the ball
slinging it back into tate territory watch-
ing the ten-second rule stalling for time
tate raged about trying ineffectively to
break up the floor game of the hot dan-
ver boys

lmer madden could not be denied
forever gil mandeville pressed a lit-
tle too hard and the referee gave him a free
one madden didnt miss free ones ever
a moment later he snatched a bounce pass
out of jerrys hands and was away down
the court fighting his way with sheer in-
dividual brilliance he passed to crimp
magee and the other tate forward some-
how found a hole through which to slip in
a two-pointer the score became danver
 tate 

  the play became a dog fight in the cen-
ter of the court danver stuck stubbornly
to its five-man defense another free shot
tied the score for the moment but a double
foul on kamp allowed jerry to cash in
two more

  at the end of the period the score was
still danver  tate  andy put sam
pavelli back in the game his strategy
he knew had held the score down and
given danver the bulge but he was afraid
of elmer madden

  in the second quarter the great tate
forward took an out ball almost at mid-
court danver went into its solid defense
madden looked them over carefully cradled
the ball in his big hands and shot the
long arching toss plunked off the back
board and dropped in

  andy said to orvie littleton go in for
gil when that guy gets the ball cover
him somehow he aint human

  littleton went in and followed madden
like a leech pavelli stole the ball from
kamp dribbled cross-court and passed to
depew skivak and littleton pulled a
quick pick on fortune as he guarded and
jerry got away to score from a difficult
angle

  littleton covered madden like a tent
time crept away

-basketball stories-winter

  then the concentration on madden left
magee free chink latzo used his great
height to seize an overhead pass and arched
it downcourt magee was all alone to
cash it

  three seconds later kamp made a blind
stab and intercepted a pass from jerry to
abe again magee was under the basket
for a bunny shot the score went to
tate  danver 

  now danver opened up and began weav-
ing their intricate slow but sure pattern
down the court madden momentarily a
free agent dug into the game he got his
hands on a backward pass intended for
pavelli and dribbled along the sidelines
orvie interfered desperately and elmer got
himself a pair of free ones on a personal
he dropped them in

a tate substitute ran on the floor and
andy realized with sinking heart
that two could and would play the stalling
game the tall tate five were past mas-
ters at the art of walking the black line
orvie littleton fought so hard that he
fouled his four personals and was given
the old heave-o tate converted each foul
to make the score tate  danver 

  the half ended andy walked disconso-
lately off the court in the wake of his down-
hearted squad in the dressing room tip
colson waited with addison ashley be-
spectacled director of athletics ashley
said sternly

  what is happening here how dare
you take over the basketball team derrick 
where is cantwell  what is the mean-
ing of this hurly burly

  tip colson interrupted smoothly why
mr ashley young - cantwell seems to have
left school unexpectedly and for no known
cause as to derrick i told you that he
has some notion that he can run the team
better than i can

  what have you to say to that de-
manded ashley of andy

  nothing said andy

  well is it the truth

  sure except that theres something
very fishy about the whole thing said
andy i thought i ought to take over
before something else went wrong with the
squad

  are you insinuating that i had some-
thing to do with cantwells disappearance
	basketball stories

said tip colson why you know as well
as i that my whole future lies here at
danver would i jeopardize that future

a voice in the doorway said gim-
me my suit hurry up help me
dress some of you birds

  eggs howled a dozen men in varying
keys where you been

  never mind that now tell you later
said the red-headed youth help me get
dressed i want to get into this ball
game

  tip colsons face was a study in mixed
emotions he stammered i dont think-
addison ashley said this is very ir-
regular i dont know-

  anything said andy you never
did

  this boy cant play for me shrilled
tip suddenly he deserted the team i
wont have this

  andy said to ashley any reason why
cantwell should not play

  well certainly not said ashley be-
wilderedly i really-i dont know-
thats what i said reiterated andy
you dont know anything well get a
load of this and youll learn something
he started a left for tips body the
big coach tried to beat him to the punch
but this time andy did not feint he let
the left ride through it doubled colson
over andy slapped it home to the head
and straightened him up then he put
a swinging right to the jaw tip colson
went over as if he had been pole-axed

  am i in charge of this team he said
to ashley

  the director of athletics said causti-
cally really this is beyond me why
you should strike colson i mean

  i know said andy wearily scram
you can fire me tomorrow if im wrong
but meantime you better get out from un-
der foot come on you kids lets see
if tate can take it nobody else around
here can

  they went out swarming like locusts in
kansas they broke up latzos old center
jump play and fed eggs a pass in mid-
court the red-head looked over the five
man defense of the tates and dribbled
straight into it

  man after man had a shot at him he
whirled among them like a flash of red-

tipped light at the last second with every-
one around him he found an opening and
passed swiftly to jerry jerry scored the
board changed to tate  danver 

  tate threw in and managed to work
down to the basket but there the embattled
danvers broke it up gil mandeville
bounced a pass brazenly between tall lat-
zos legs to sol levin levin back-passed
to gil jerry and eggs crossed each other
downcourt with the guards pursuing eggs
cut in a reverse and took a timed pass from
mandeville sam pavelli took it from
eggs and pivoted eggs shook kamp and
came into the play at close quarters sam
gave him the ball

  eggs looked for jerry morrie fortune
had him covered eggs gave it back to
pavelli and moved behind jerrys man
jerry ran around fast fortune spun and
ran into eggs jerry scored again tate
 danver 

the danver stands had taken heart
and were howling for blood andy sat
on the edge of the bench and wondered
how long it would last against tates fight-
ing five

  the pace was killing andy detected
a harsh note in sol levins breathing and
sent piggy betts in to relieve the hard-
pressed guard tate was desperate now
stalling for time stemming the danver
rush

  eggs cantwell tore a pass off the fin-
gers of crimp magee and pivoted piggy
betts fresh and strong came rolling up
from guard and took a fast one into the
corner the rotund reserve guard stead-
ied himself and had plenty of time to
make it good tate  danver  the
period ended

  abe skivaks face was drawn and lined
with the pace they were setting andy said
to joe corvil heres another spot for a
pinch-hitter go in there and get tough

  corvil grinned and said ill slay em
andy

  skivak panted to a seat beside him and
said theyre mighty strong coach ill
be all right with a minutes rest if eggs
can keep it up-

  time was getting short with tate using
every stunt known to the game then
eggs stole a toss-in from the boundary
line and started a set play corvil and
razzle-dazzle racketeer	

sam pavelli switched so quickly that tate
was caught flat-footed eggs gave the ball
to corvil the big end leaped high in
the air and flipped overhand from the edge
of the foul circle pie missed and eggs
made a grab for the ball kamp over-
covered and eggs had a free one he
converted to make it danver  tate 

  tate tossed in and gave up trying to pro-
tect their slimming lead elmer madden
flashed again seeking points piggy betts
began to puff and sol levin begged to go
in andy let him go with orders that the
stronger gil mandeville should take over
on madden then sol broke up a madden-
latzo pass at mid-court and broke up the
attack

  eggs took a bounder and dribbled down-
court past three tate men jerry depew
was free for a second and eggs passed to
him cutting back jerry promptly gave it
back to eggs with the lead hanging in
the balance the hand of the red-head never
trembled he sunk the shot as calmly as
if in practise pandemonium broke loose
in the big gym as the score changed to
danver  tate 

andy hesitated it was a spot to play
safe the game was running swiftly
to a close if danver could hold the five-
man defense line as well as they had in
the first period they could win by a point

  he remembered tates attempt to play
safe and how eggs had cut down their lead
elmer madden was roaring up and down
the court out there a loose ball anywhere
would let him have a shot andy said

  abe go in for joe corvil tell the
boys to play out the string one point
isnt enough against madden

  skivak bounded onto the court in a
second the danver offense was proceeding
merrily they started with an out under
the tate basket

  depew threw into eggs eggs side-
stepped pivoting and passed to pavelli
the tall center dribbled three steps and ran
into a tate stone wall pie paused until
eggs rolled up behind him then he rolled
the ball along the floor to cantwells feet

  eggs came up with the leather and
grinned at the looming tate men side-
stepping fritz kamp he let go a long one
from the waist snapping his wrists

  the ball went high into the air seemed

to hesitate it dropped straight down with
backspin and passed through the net
scarcely disturbing the hempen strands

  andy said that did it that breaks
their backs theyre licked

  they were licked they fought hope-
lessly now until the gun barked and dan-
ver at last had its conference champion-

  there was madness on the smooth boards
as the danver mob descended upon its he-
roes of the moment andy fought his way
to the dressing room herding the sweat-
ing laughing players ahead of him

they gathered there no one making
an attempt to change his clothes the
air was charged with tension addison
ashley and the dean of men paul beasely
came in tip colson was between them
his jaw swollen and his eye a beautiful
purple the dean said 

  mr derrick i believe some explana-
tions are in order what reason do you
have for assaulting your superior mr
colson

  eggs cantwell stood up he walked
over and planted himself in front of the
three men he said

  i can tell you about that sir it was
on account of me

  tip colson was pale he could not run
but he had the appearance of a man who
would rather be elsewhere

  eggs said i came here on a scholarship
offered to me by mr derrick but i
couldnt have come if mr david corbin
hadnt helped by giving my mother money
to live upon we are poor people and
since father died i have been the sole sup-
port of my mother mr corbin said he
was a friend of my fathers and would be
glad to help out if i could get a scholar-
ship

  andy said so that was it

  i saw nothing wrong with this as i
intended paying mr corbin back as soon
as i could went on cantwell well this
morning i got a note on the deans sta-
tionery telling me that corbin is a com-
mon gambler and that i was fired out of
school and if i didnt leave at once i
would be arrested

  why-no such note ever left my of-
fice said the startled dean this is all
news to me
	basketball stories

  well i fell for it said eggs i left
town and went away then someone got
to me and showed me where i was wrong
and that someone had forged the deans
signature to the note it wasnt a very
good forgery so i came back as fast as i
could

  colson never could write worth a darn
said andy

  colson do you mean to say colson
had anything to do with this prepos-
terous exploded the dean he was
furious

  oh yeah look at his face hes
about to bust said andy hes mort-
gaged to the hilt with dave corbin hes
in a spot now that we won and more
dough is lost

  is this true colson said the dean
well said andy who else knew
about the arrangement with corbin and
cantwell certainly a pal of corbins
tip is corbins intimate let him deny
that

  eggs said his handwriting on that
note can be identified besides i know it
was him it couldnt be anyone else i
know that now

colson licked his dry lips he said
now i can explain everything
andy raised a big fist and said youre
not going to explain anything more around
these diggins wise guy im going to fix
that right now

  eggs cantwell was ahead of him leap-
ing into the air the red-head swung heav-
ily colson went down and out andy
said reprovingly

  tch tch eggs that was a very
clumsy wallop i see i will have to teach
you how to hit

  the dean said well i never saw-i
mean this must not get out boys the
scandal would be terrible we will allow
colson to resign and leave town derrick
you will of course take over you seem
to have your heart in the job

  at increased pay murmured andy
softly

  of course of course see to it ash-
ley see to it said the dean removing
himself somewhat hastily from the scene

he felt his dignity was somewhat in danger

  ashley said hesitantly im sorry der-
rick i dont-

  know a damn thing said andy help-
ing him out

  okay ashley youre excused see
you later about that raise dont forget
that

  he turned to the team i dont have to

pions eggs who in the world dug you

  the gallant forward shuffled his feet

a sap to fall for that fake note an to
think a dame a co-ed hadda figure it
out

  annabelle shouted andy he ran
out of the dressing room and down the
hall annabelle by all thats holy he
repeated what a fool i was not to figure

  his coupe was parked up against a no
parking sign he jumped in and grabbed
her around the neck he said

or wouldnt you be interested in using
that money to get married on say next
week 

 andy blew on his right hand he
sighed you got me baby i cant refuse
you but my hands are gonna look like
hell all swollen up at the wedding
new rules new thrills

by specialist

       the heats on and the spectator gets a break in the revamped
       court code gone are those jump-ball delays the play speeds
       up the scoring mounts and the bench jumps into the show

the spectator will find basketball
suited to his fancy this season the
rules committee has opened its heart
and given the customer plenty of consid-
eration in effecting changes in the court
game the principal change in the official
basketball code for - puts the ball
into play in the center circle of the court
only at the beginning of the game at the
start of the second half after held ball
and after technical fouls and double fouls

  the procedure will be the same as last
season when a foul goal is scored the ball
will go to the team scored upon out of
bounds under the opponents basket the
team scored upon will immediately take
possession of the ball and start the action
the official does not handle the ball in
either case

  in the past the two centers returned to
the circle for a center-jump after each
goal there was always delay by players
or officials and the spectator often found
his interest in the game lagging the shift
in the rule will bring more speed into the
game and should prove more interesting
to the fans the dull periods will be done
away with entirely by forcing the players
to speed up their movements on the court
it means perpetual play and  time for
players to rest or stall before the ball
goes back into action

  the change will open up the game to
permit more scoring this is something
mr joe public has wanted for a long time
he comes to the game to see lots of shoot-
ing and goes away dissatisfied when plenty
of action is missing with the new rule
and the ball going into play without the
center tap both teams will find it difficult
to get their defences set many scores
will be made by one and two long passes
down the court with a shot following

  with speed the underlying factor in the
game for the coming season more will- de-
pend upon the lasting qualities of the

teams than formerly the ball has to come
out of the backcourt in order to pay divi-
dends in the matter of scoring and it will
take fast going for the full forty minutes
if a team wants to be in front at the final
whistle no team can afford to tire or
bog down this means that more and more
reserves are going to get into action for
a change

  the day of the five-man team in basket-
ball is passe it will take five starting
players and a complete supplement of
capable substitutes to engage properly in
any contest this winter the rules state
that a player may return to the game twice
so we are going to see far more sub-
stituting than has been witnessed in past
seasons

  the spectator ought to be pleased at
this he will see many more players in
action and the interest will not be con-
fined to one or two stars but spread to
the entire squad how often in past cam-
paigns have rival coaches and fans sung
the praises of one or two individuals in
speaking of the accomplishments of a
team now the interest will be spread out
over the entire squad true a starting
team may be a veteran aggregation prop-
erly conditioned and possessing better than
average marksmen but what of the reserve
material  here may be the answer to many
a games results the reserves will have
to be almost as formidable as the regulars
if a team wishes to stay in the running
under the new rules

  then again the manner and time of
making substitutions will prove of interest
to the followers of a team the coach will
have to think of the opponents reserves
in the same grouping as the regulars and
will have to be on his toes in the matter
of sending in replacements the coach has
to keep in mind the strength of his own
outfit and in addition must make substi-
tutions to offset tlie strength and power


	basketball stories

of the rival quintet in ice hockey they
replace the forward line as a whole to
freshen up the attack the same idea will
follow in basketball

  scoring will spread out over many play-
ers as a result of using more men in a
game this will tend to do away with
discontent and everyone will feel that he
has a part in the teams performances
there will not be just one or two stand-
out stars on a club like in past seasons-
the whole squad will figure in the show

  of course this matter of substituting
will give coaches and trainers additional
work they will have to work faster on
subs and regulars to have them ready for
replacements during the progress of the
game every man on the bench will have
to be constantly ready for action at all
times

  the trend of the new rule is to do away
with stalling and this is further empha-
sized by a deliberate foul rule which al-
lows the team fouled two free throws from
the foul line this is to prevent a team
that is one or two points behind in the
closing minutes of the game making a
deliberate foul to get possession of the ball
here in the east this was called a smart
foul by the fans

  remember the spectators part in the
game when teams were guilty of freez-
ing the ball stalling and making de-
liberate fouls to gain possession of the ball
near the close of the game you never
heard such howling booing and handing
out of bronx cheers as went on in most
gyms under the circumstances

not all of course will favor the tak-
ing away of the action at the center
circle and will feel sorry to see the center-
jump done away with for many there
was always a moment of great suspense
in a tight basketball game as to which
team would get possession of the ball from
center the team out in front or the rival
vainly endeavoring to close up the gap
if you are behind by a point possession

of the ball meant you had a chance to take
a last try at the basket and because of
this fact the center tap proved interesting
to many

  unless teams are in shape the game will
not work out to the ideas of the changes
in the rules which look for added action
and swifter movements around the court
it will take a little time this season for the
teams to get used to the change at the
end of the - court season the new
york university freshmen and the col-
lege of the city of new york jayvees
played one half of their game according
to the new rule the contest was played
at a clinic held for eastern college coaches
by the metropolitan basketball writers
association at madison square garden

  despite the obvious unfamiliarity of the
players with the temporarily changed rules
the game did throw a little light on the
difference between a contest played with-
out the center tap and one with the fix-
ture the game proved faster and much
harder for the combatants and substitu-
tions were frequent boys who had played
most of the game were thoroughly worn
out and said they missed the brief breath-
ing spell afford by bringing the ball back
to the circle before resuming play we
will find out lots more about this now that
the rule is in force

  with the game speeded up we will find
many new mechanical devices like time
clocks more modern baskets and such gad-
gets introduced to add interest on the part
of spectators one of the newest of these
ideas recently approved by the rules com-
mittee is a rigid double-ring basket that
causes a light to flash when a goal is
scored here again is a movement to cre-
ate spectator interest the basket with a
light attached gives new thrills and excite-
ment to the sport

  there is no doubt in my mind but that
the spectator interest came out on top
in the rule changes for this coming season
this will of course aid the game by giving
the players and coaches more support

an excited murmur rose
and swelled into a roar
leftyl lash go it
lucky i

sharpshooters like lefty lash are
born not made one-handed he
could out-ace any backboard artist
in the business two handed-when
that miracle-moment came-the -
day-wonder was a fabulous flop

a complete novelet

raning forward from balcony
 and sidelines the crowd held its
v breath the white-jerseyed referee
tossed the ball as if catapulted by the
same spring the rival centers leaped

  the rangy giant in the light-blue shirt
won the tap the ball slapped into the
hands of a light-blue forward stopped
dead as he pivoted for a dribble his hasty
pass was low his teammate juggled it
lost it and a watchful maroon-shirt shov-

eled it off the floor and down the court

  a drawn-out ah-h rose from the
crowd

  dad brill squirmed on the taylor bench
his champions of last year were dubs to-
night the slim young spectator against
the wall gray eyes keen on the play
squirmed in sympathy with coach brill
beside him a spectacled youth growled
whats the matter with the varsity any-
how


	basketball stories

  half an hour later a gun barked it
was over-and little tech had held the
champions of the conference to a four-
point victory

  dad brill put the question in the locker
room

  theres your first game of the sea-
son he said evenly your first win-
and maybe your last youre not playing
not the way you can play have you for-
gotten games dont just win themselves
are you stale  whats the trouble bart 
for a moment bart edwards captain
and forward slowly shook his blond head
his voice was the least bit surly cant
say coach we just lacked the zip
tom

  the big center met the coachs eye with
a baffled air i cant put a finger on it
brill turned to the other three of his
stars of yesteryear george disston stocky
carrot-topped guard spoke up techs
stronger than last year coach

  thats not reason enough retorted the
coach relentlessly

  the other guard fred martin moodily
poked a shoe with a sock-covered toe
avoiding brills eye vandy porter dark-
haired audacious forward prankster of
the squad and one of its quickest thinkers
couldnt think of anything to say

  brill eyed them sternly we shift to
the new gymnasium after the dedication
tomorrow night maybe the fast court will
speed you up if it doesnt    ill have
to find a new team he rubbed his chin
with a weathered thumb glanced from
one silent figure to the others in turn and
left them

dad brill was beset with doubts
maybe he said to himself as he let
himself into the locked gymnasium the next
day after a flashy practice session a new
court will speed up those cocky guys
maybe he added sourly a kick in the pants
would do it better

  he strode down the entrance hall of the
huge new building to the doors opening
upon the basketball court turned the knob
and pulled then he stood stock-still in
surprise that mounted to quick interest as
sight of the lone occupant of the court

  the youth was in overalls and faded
blue work shirt but he was not work-
ing off to the right on the sideline a

big polishing broom lay disregarded its
errant operator his back to dad brill
stood on the gleaming white foul line a
worn basketball balanced nicely in his left
hand

  the coach squinted in puzzlement he
stopped breathing as the overalled youth
poised for a throw with his right hand at
his side that trim shoulder swung back
and the lad shot left-handed in a chest
shove for the basket

  soaring with a clean loft the ball gy-
rated slowly and fell-so true that the
hoop was undisturbed and only the sway
of pristine white net marked the passage
of the leather globe

  dad brill whistled softly between his
teeth he looked dazedly for the ball-
tosser and saw him trapping the ball as
it was about to roll over the end line
hey dad brill shouted

  the lad looked up startled ball in
hand he walked slowly to meet the coach
on the highly polished floor he stepped
with a poise that annoyed brill whose feet
found uncertain footing on the waxed
hardwood

  some of his irritation came out in his
growl whore you

  the lad glanced at the broom in some
confusion im assistant janitor he ex-
plained

  hm then why arent you sweeping
instead of playing monkeyshines with a
ball and whose ball is it anyway one
of the squads

  no sir its one of my own i mean
my only one and im all through work
ill go over this floor again though my
shoes are clean he lifted one foot to
show the smooth leather sole and heel

  brill marveled you mean to say you
can walk with those slick soles on this
floor

  why yes sir im used to all kinds
of floors-smooth as this or pretty rough

  where was this

  high school league the upstate
league

  youve played high-school basketball
and youre a student here how is it you
havent turned out with the freshman
squad

  im a sophomore sir transferred
from holmes to get in the engineering
school here
sureshot	

  sophomore hey eligible for the
varsity well well how is it youre not
out for practice

  the lad lifted his right arm gave it a
scornful look this arm busted it and
the ligaments never healed right i havent
played basketball since high school

  hm so you shoot left-handed   
can you shoot another

  without a word the lad stepped quickly
to the foul line gauged the distance and
snapped the ball again with the same eye-
filling shot a shove from the chest the
sphere described a lazy parabola and
dropped cleanly into the basket

  brill grunted again

  the lad recovered the ball moved to
the right side of the court eyed the basket
and suddenly hooked the ball underhand
it flew low

  missed it said brill to himself

  but the drab leather globe slapped the
far side of the hoop jiggled in the circle
and dropped through the net the coach
gasped he walked mincingly on uncer-
tain footing toward the waiting youth
hm know who i am

 yes sir youre dad-er-coach
brill

  want to play basketball

  the lads gray eyes flashed then he
gave brill a keen glance do you think

i	could with this arm

  why not report tomorrow in the
athletic directors office and in the mean-
time theres something you can do for the
team something like this he talked
fast with a gleam in his eye

the whole student body of taylor
university was jammed into the bask-
etball court of the new gymnasium for the
formal dedication of the building that
night also on hand were a dozen visit-
ing dignitaries one of whom a promi-
nent alumnus had made a brief address
now came the christening of the court

  from the sideline where students jos-
tled far beyond the edge of the court-
since there would be no play tonight-
stepped coach dad brill resplendent in
dinner jacket boiled shirt and black tie
he raised a microphone which was hooked
up to amplifiers

  ladies and gentlemen he announced
to dedicate this court to the ideals of clean

sport the members of last years cham-
pionship basketball team will form on the
foul line each to shoot a basket

  applause cheers from the sidelines
stepped the blond bart edwards the grin-
ning dark-haired vandy porter big tom
kirkland fred martin and george diss-
ton all handsome chaps in their tuxedo
finery

  brill tossed a new ball to edwards the
captain caught it handily eyed the basket
tossed-and slipped his dancing pumps
flying out from under him he sat down
hard the ball missed the basket by a
good two feet

  a roar of laughter rose was hushed in-
stantly as edwards looked up with a be-
wildered scowl and welled up again as he
grinned sheepishly and stepped back to
the sideline

  somebody tossed the ball out and vandy
porter grabbed it scowling he looked
down at his feet took a cautious stance
and swung slowly the ball smacked the
near side of the hoop and bounced back
the shot was a foot low

  nobody laughed this time instead a
low murmur filled the hall porter stalked
off the court angrily but not forgetting to
step cautiously lest he slide

  tom kirkland threw and made it
though the ball for a moment seemed per-
versely inclined to roll out of the hoop
fred martin crouched tensely tossed and
hit the backboard for a miss george
disston took a long swing bounced the ball
off the hoop to the backboard and sighed
as it caromed back for a basket

  a cheer rolled out but it was short-
lived and the hum and buzz of excited
voices filled the hall taylors five stars
had made only two out of five tries for
a free goal

  brill alone now in the center of the
court held up a hand and the buzz died
away and now to conclude the exhi-
bition i present evidence of the value of
consistent practice difficult one-hand
shots by sophomore john lash

  a smattering of hand-claps followed as
brill his face wooden waved a hand who
was this lash ah there he was step-
ping to the foul line he seemed cool
enough in his neat-fitting blue street suit
and sober tie the crowd stared avidly
who was dad brill putting up
	basketball stories

  the gray eyes squinted at the basket
the left hand came up-and the spectators
watched mutely as the ball snapped from
the shoulder in a high arc to a sweet goal
for a moment the silence held and the
smack of the ball on the floor was audi-
ble at the far corners of the packed hall

  then a bedlam of cheers broke out the
slender lad in the blue suit smiled shyly
accepted the ball from the end line moved
six paces to his right and hooked to the
basket clean through the net again the
crowd roared

john lash moved again to his right
and nearer the end line his circling
gave him a sight of the first-team stars
grouped on the sideline and he felt a
strangely uneasy thrill as he saw them star-
ing quickly he shifted the ball to his
left hand swung it overhand high-into
the basket then he turned to brill saw
the coach nod and walked off the court as
the applause reached a crescendo

  but his effort to lose himself in the press
between sideline and wall was foiled a
hand fell on his arm and he turned to face
bart edwards

  the blond captain eyed him in perplexity
and some chagrin fellow that was sweet
shooting he told lash he laughed in
confusion i couldnt even stand up out
there why arent you out for the team
well

  hes turning out tomorrow tom
kirkland had ranged alongside edwards
and there too were porter disston and
martin the center went on to edwards
coach just told me lash is eligible for
the varsity

  vandy porter laughed youll be tak-
ing my job lash honest now why
havent you been out

  john lash smiled shyly im really not
so good and besides i have a job around
here assistant janitor

  edwards stared porter opened his
eyes and chortled so thats it lefty
lash the clean sweep

  the other four roared  lash colored
and the smile left his lips he turned
away so hastily that he collided with a
small dark-haired girl in a crimson-traced
black dress sorry he mumbled and
as her brown eyes widened in annoyance
he hurried on out of the hall

  the five stars watched him soberly
edwards said vandy you shouldnt have
said that the others murmured in agree-
ment

  yeah i know admitted porter i
guess i was burning because he showed
us all up well we were lousy-but why
did he have to do it one-handed

ii

the sign on the door read director
of athletics john lash turned the
knob and walked in to find himself in an
anteroom occupied by a girl at a desk
she looked up then stared coldly

  so its you mr lash she remarked
with some asperity have you come to
apologize 

  lash blinked what i dont-oh
youre-why yes youre the girl i
bumped into last night i-er-sorry
he fumbled with his hat

  the girl was regarding him with min-
gled amusement and mock severity are
you always a day late she asked you
seem to be able to shoot a basketball fast
enough

  im not much good he assured her
but coach brill asked me to turn out
so im here to report

  for basketball she took a card from
a file name address from what
school he told her she wrote his an-
swers and added sophomore anything
else out of your personal history she
asked brightly

  he regarded her for a moment with a
trace of irritation for her airy manner
then you might put down that im an
assistant janitor he said coldly that
fact seems to amuse the whole campus
maybe you can get a kick out of it

  she gave him a quick glance then
laughed merrily why should it im
a working woman myself secretary to the
athletic director-and something of a
charwoman myself in this office

  lash eyed her for a moment then
grinned feebly well thats nice and
-er-whats your name

  moira cavan she responded pertly
not that youll be needing it i do my
own sweeping

  oh lash turned brick-red to the
roots of his wavy brown hair and turned
svreshot	

on his heel the door slammed shut

  well said moira cavan to herself
a touchy one she picked up her pen-
cil but it rested idle on the sheet before
her as she stared meditatively at the blank
face of the door

  outside lash almost cannoned into
george disston oh hello lash the
guard greeted him signed up

  yes lash nodded toward the door
gave the dope to miss-er-cavan nice
girl

  disston gave him a sharp look yeah
he drawled vandy porters girl
oh lash nodded hurriedly he in-
quired going to the gym 

  yep come on disston led the way
from the administration building the
two emerged on a wide walk and headed
for the gymnasium a pair of strolling
students hailed disston stopped to stare
at lash the guard returned the salutes
and grinned at his companion youre
quite a freak lash he remarked cam-
pus doesnt know whether to rate you a
genius or a show-off come now which
is it

  neither lash retorted of course
id like to play but-i dont know

  disston eyed the slim lad curiously
coach tell you the reason he wanted you
out

  n-no just to fill out the squad i
guess he did tell me- lash hesitated
then he plunged ahead well i guess all
you fellows know he said he wanted me
to show off last night to remind the whole
squad that practice makes perfect i hope
you arent holding it against me

          me disston assured him
llof course it might be-well a
little bit different with edwards and por-
ter and martin theyre all seniors and
seniors turn haughty you know kirk-
thats tom kirkland-and i are juniors
and bad enough i guess but you made
us all look silly when you made all your
shots and we missed three out of five
it was the floor lash explained pa-
tiently i was used to it-sweeping up
ever since they finished it and you wore
leather on that slick surface

  yeah disston agreed dubiously but
the boys are taking an awful ribbing he
gave lash a sidelong look er-while

were on the subject you-er-dont mind
the chatter about your being a janitor
lash stared ahead as he walked and
said evenly no not a bit after all
im a pretty good janitor

  disston laughed right spirit going
to drop it now youre on the basketball
squad 

  cant i need the money and ive
got my work hours changed

  they reached the gymnasium entered a
side door and plunged into a noisy locker
room players in various stages of un-
dress greeted them familiarly hi
george hello hey give a cheer
boys-heres lucky lefty lash the clean
sweep

  lash flushed but met the curious stares
with unconcern disston showed him a
locker and he sat down a lad on his left
offered a hand my names struve he
announced this is sub country hereabout
he indicated the double row of lockers
in a sort of corridor this is gorlitz
a swarthy short lad stuck out a hand
nodded and went on with his dressing

  a whistle blew and lash hurriedly
laced his remaining shoe and pulled on his
shirt pie followed the others as they filed
out of the room to the court a flight above

  four teams formed each in a circle on
the floor as dad brill in a dingy gray
sweater called names the first team was
in one corner chatting as they waited for
a ball brill saw lash and beckoned him
to another group try your hand at for-
ward over here he commanded ran-
dall take lash on your five

  a lazy-looking six-footer came up
okay coach hi lash over here
play left forward when we line up he
caught a ball flipped by an assistant coach
and shot it to the man behind him around
the circle it went until it came to lash
who catching it with his left hand at-
tempted to shove it with his right it went
wide and rolled to brills feet he picked
it up saw glances directed at lash but
said nothing lash caught the next pass
and hurried the ball along with a two-hand
shove at once a twinge traveled up his
right arm he set his teeth and continued
the practice

  a whistle stopped the warm-up brill
pointed to the varsity five minutes
he announced the champions versus
	basketball stories

randalls scrubs-randall struve gor-
litz meek and lash

  lash tensed here he was in a practice
game-against the taylor varsity he
trotted to his position-and was assailed
with misgivings he was left forward-
on the side of the court where he could
shoot when close only with his bad arm

  he had no time for worries in the
center ring big tom kirkland and randall
stood face to face brill at one side
tossed the ball kirland won the tap and
the ball fell into verne porters waiting
arms meek sprang to screen him but
porter flashed past on a dribble halfway
to the basket struve stopped him and he
passed to edwards who flipped fast with
a neat goal

  they look good dont they randall
was at lashs side speaking low per-
sonally i think the coach figures theyre
loafing maybe you can get a spot on the
first team ill try to slip you a ball

  lash nodded but as he took his place he
felt his right arm it looked like the old
trouble in slow practice it had never
bothered him but now in play he was
feeling the strain on ligaments once torn
and never healed

beyond the end line randall throw-
ing in caught lashs eye and heaved
a fast one past disston lash took it
pivoted to find himself in the clear and
dashed down the side line with the pat-pat-
pat of the dribble sweet music in his ears

  at the center line edwards caught him
at a tangent and he flipped a lighting pass
to gorlitz edwards turned in and the
swarthy forward shot back to lash in the
corner with a full overhand sweep lash
laid the ball in the basket varsity 
scrubs 

  then the varsity turned on the heat
lash warmed up and eager was in every
play but the savage dashes of edwards
and porter left meek and struve behind
and when the scrubs for an instant would
regain the ball martin and disston rode
them to hasty passes that lost them a dozen
scoring chances

  three goals had gone to the varsitys
credit when lash got the ball on the left
side of the court near the end line he
rifled it out to randall who screened by
both martin and disston slapped it back

in desperation lash tried for goal but
his left-hand hook swinging near the end
line missed the hoop by three feet

  and it was on this play that brill blew
the whistle

  thats all for you two teams other
teams line up he walked over to lash
why didnt you throw that last one with
your right hand

  its gone bad lash ran his fingers
gingerly over the upper arm and shoulder
first time i tried it out it went stiff
mm brill eyed the arm well
better give it a rest ill put someone else
on randalls team tomorrow he strode
to the center line to signal resumption of
play

  randall had heard the coachs last words
laid off eh thats tough anyway
lash you did what the coach wanted you
to do

  eh  what do you mean 

  you know-stirring up the varsity with
that swell exhibit of yours last night and
you did it again when you shot that basket
right after their own notice how they
speeded up i guess thats your mission
in life-according to dad brill

 oh lash nodded yeah he
watched the two scrub teams in center
court then turned back to randall with
seeming nonchalance it was fun though
playing with you hope i get a chance
again some time

  sure assured randall heartily any
time fella

half an hour later lash was walking
down the dusk-shrouded walk so
that was it just an alarm-clock for the
varsity and everyone on the campus
knew it-except john lash his face was
grim as he began the turn on to the walk
that led toward his rooming house sud-
denly he slowed far downuthe walk was
a vaguely familiar figure yes it was
moira cavan he hesitated then wheeled
and strode toward her

  she recognized him as he approached
and stopped and how did the practice
go mr lash  and how many baskets did
you shoot

  one lash informed her my first
and last i guess for taylor

  the brown eyes widened she surveyed
him gravely why she asked bluntly
svreshot	

  for a moment he was tempted to tell her
of the troubling arm but he stifled the
words give her a chance to pass the story
along-perhaps as an alibi no appar-
ently only dad brill and john lash knew
about that let it go he eyed her with
a wry grin you see miss cavan im
not a regular player im just an ostrich
egg on the wall

  a which

  to encourage the hens to do better i
shoot baskets to keep the team informed
that it can be done that practice makes
good shooting good screening good pass-
ing et cetera he shrugged thats
something you might add to my personal-
history card its been nice to see you
and- he added with a grin -it was
handy my knowing your name maybe
ill have a chance to use it again

  she smiled wrinkling her nose at him
maybe    and are you going to keep on
with the practice

  why not

  of course why not itll straighten
your back after your toil over a broom
she laughed flicked him a wave of her
hand and passed on

  lash grinned somehow a broom would
never seem quite so unfriendly a thing he
thought now that he knew moira cavan

  and then suddenly he remembered that
moira cavan was vandy porters girl   

ill

ringed around the polished floor that
in its waxy sheen winked back at the
great archlights overhead the crowd
watched with like witnesses at an execu-
tion taylor rooters held their breath chat-
ter even the rittenden section across the
court sat or stood subdued by the startling
tidings of the scoreboard taylor-great
taylor champions of the conference-was
trailing

  at the end of the bench dad brill hooked
his right leg over his left knee then he
slowly and carefully uncrossed his legs
and crossed them again with the left leg
up he said nothing

  in the middle of the bench john lash
sat swathed in a heavy sweater out of
the corner of his eye he had watched the
play of dad brills legs well he thought
the old boy cant blame me-i delivered the

order but he couldnt help feeling a warm
rush of sympathy for the coach

  and for the players on the floor big
tom kirkland was breathing hard of the
five champions he had worked hardest
and the strain was telling on him his
foul-line play had been perfection and in
the up-court passing his long arms had
more than once averted disaster yet tay-
lor was trailing

  the guards were drilling in doggedly
for that matter so were the forwards
then how explain the score-rittenden
 taylor 

  you couldnt put a finger on it

  but dad brill knew john lash knew
and even the players themselves revealed
by their harried looks that taylor was in
a slump

  john lash was worried he had seen
this great team in action only once a year
before and had marveled at their dash and
daring in a crucial game now they were
wilting outplayed by a team rated no bet-
ter than fourth in the eight-team confer-
ence uneasily he wondered if his own ap-
pearance on the scene had upset their team-
play but that couldnt be   

  the ball shuttled down the court by
porter and edwards struck a barrier in
the rittenden guard and went out of
bounds in the breathing spell lashs eyes
strayed over his shoulder to his left

  she was still there he had spotted her
earlier in the game when she was leaning
forward intent on a play near the taylor
basket now he found her eyes on him
and the shock of meeting that level glance
of dark brown eyes confused him he
smiled tentatively and she nodded brightly

  he turned back to the court-and met a
hostile stare from vandy porter who near
the foul lane was waiting for the throw-
in  

  and here it came it was intended for
porter but the dashing forward wasnt
ready that by-play between bench and
girl had caught his eye

  too late he stabbed for the ball but it
eluded his fingers hit the floor-was
snapped up by a speeding rittenden man
and rushed down the court the light-
blues rallied in haste but too late ritten-
dens center took a quick pass flicked the
ball without halting its journey into the
hands of his forward and the jubilant
	basketball stories

forward with time to burn shot an up-
swinging down-breaking net-swishing
basket rittenden  taylor 

across the way rittenden rooters
howled in glee on the taylor side
the low murmur of discontent was lost in
the din lash shivered suddenly he felt
a nudge at his elbow randall was whis-
pering something there at his side

  see coach and randall nodded sig-
nificantly

  hastily lash rose and trotted to the
right end of the bench he stopped be-
fore dad brill you sent for me

  the coach looked him up and down
pretty well bundled up arent you son
lash grinned sourly i didnt expect
to take this off tonight

  brills eyes gleamed think you could
shoot a couple of baskets

  could i lashs face lit up but he
sobered instantly i believe i could-
from right court

  okay go in he indicated two of-
ficials who sat nearby each with watch in
hand report to the scorers about five
minutes to play before the half ends
porter out

  porter the forward was being jerked
because lash had smiled at his girl lash
felt a momentary qualm of guilt as he
ripped off his heavy sweater and raced to
the scorers lash seventeen for porter
the scorer looked up startled for
eight games-or was it nine-no member
of the taylor varsity had been replaced so
summarily restups yes but here was
a substitution made in cold blood with tay-
lor in the red the scorer shot a quick
look at dad brills averted face turned to
wait for the completion of a pass then
sounded his horn

  the eleven men on the court whirled as
one in slow surprise a substitution from
the taylor bench the referee strove to
keep the astonishment out of his expres-
sion lash striding onto the court felt
that eleven million faces rather than eleven
were swimming in the air before him
haltingly he addressed the referee lash
for porter

  vandy porter stared unbelievingly at
lash then aware suddenly that the at-
tention of all the players was on him he
spun on his heel toward the bench but as

he passed lash he spoke gratingly after
my girl and my job lash you certainly
try for a clean sweep

  edwards moved up slapped lash on
the shoulder then he sprang to position
lash followed suit as the referee poised to
toss kirkland knocked the sphere to
lashs right he stabbed for it knocked it
down with his stiff arm caught it on the
bounce with his handy left and was oif on
a dribble two rittenden men bore down
in a close screen and lash passed across
court to edwards then streaked on the side
line past the screen edwards saw the
dash and cashed in his bullet-pass was
aimed far ahead of lash but the slim
speedster was there when the ball arrived
his catch merged like lightning into a
dribble that flashed all the way to the right
corner where a rittenden guard was hurry-
ing up hotfoot

  but lash had his stance he hooked it
high with plenty of loft and in the silence
he thought he could hear the swish of the
ball dropping through the net

  the crowd came to life the taylor
side resounded with wild cheers while on
the rittenden side excited voices asked
did you see that one-hand shot boy
what a honey

  edwards was slapping lash happily tom
kirkland nudged him with a playful
knuckle but both lash could see were
plenty worried rittenden still had a two-
point lead

  a rittenden guard threw it out from the
end line at once a teammate whirled to
dribble out of danger but in his haste he
crowded too close to the screening lash
his shoulder dug into leftys ribs and
lash went down

the referees whistle sounded lash
arose with a wry grin for the discom-
fited rittenden man and the taylor five
moved eagerly for the free throw ed-
wards motioned encouragingly to lash

  someone high in the balcony on the tay-
lor side caught that signal down the
chimney lefty make it a good one
the crowd on the taylor side took up the
chant drop er down lefty give us
that point wipe out that margin

  lash set his jaw as he took the ball from
the referee and toed the foul line before
him he saw edwards kirkland martin and
sureshot



disston where was-oh yes porter was
out and lash was in pinch-shooting
for the varsity his good left hand
trembled and he shifted on his feet sud-
denly he saw tom kirklands anxious face
and realized that for several seconds all
eyes had been upon him how many
seconds  he had only ten   

  with a rush of breath he thrust from
the shoulder and his heart sank it was
a bad shot too strong the ball clanged
against the far side of the ring teetered-
fell through the skill of practice had
checked the error of a hasty throw

  and the stands were rioting again on
taylors side with cheers the ritten-
den forces were clapping with grudging
admiration for the second score by this
left-hander and the scoreboard read rit-
tenden  taylor 

  edwards came up grinning nice go-
ing boy how about one more-before
my taffy hair goes gray

  kirkland shook the captains arm bart
lets feed the kid since hes going good
what say

  for a moment the captain hesitated he
eyed lash with narrowed eyes okay
lash yeah all right tom feed im

  they fed him swift slaps from the
jump rifle-shot passes up-court sizzlers
that tipped rittenden fingers and found a
welcome in the lean arm of john lash
always he jockeyed to the right corner
and when the pass beat the rittenden
screen the ball lofted to the hoop again
and again and yet again and when the
gun ended the half the scoreboard read
taylor  rittenden 

  in the locker room dad brill walked up
to a flushed and exultant lash nice
work son and hows the arm

  lash started the arm he kneaded
the triceps and winced

  brill nodded thought so youve
had enough for tonight

  but 

  no buts take a shower and get a
rubdown right away the coach
turned away beckoned porter to the fast-
talking varsity group the forward moved
eagerly up tossing a wintry smile over his
shoulder at lashs discomfiture

  a squat bald man with bright blue eyes
waddled up as lash peeled his shirt off
rubdown heh im the guy cmon

 over here he led the way to a flat slab
 and jerked his thumb whats the trou-
 ble right arm oke   tell me how
 this feels he ran three stiff fingers deep
 into the lean triceps and nodded almost as
 if in satisfaction when lash bit his lip to
 stifle a cry thought so he sat on the
 edge of the slab and gestured to the empty
 benches where a minute before a chatter-
 ing crowd of players had thronged they
 dont know it and they wont know it
 dad keeps his lips buttoned and so do i
 so i guess itll just be a secret among the
 three of us-seeing as how you wont talk
 if you know its all for dear old taylor

ctthat are you talking about

   w lash managed to say

   the trainer beamed upon him sympa-
 thetically youll never make the team
 thats what

  lash scowled why not

   theres the why not the squat one
 pointed to the aching right arm it wont
 take it you can play a few minutes then
 it stiffens up on you right lash
 nodded well thats it dad guessed
 it after your first practice now hes sure
 of it

   so im all through lash slumped
 wearily

   no you aint thats just the point
 the trainer jabbed a finger you practice
 -light-and you warm the bench just so
 those prima donnasll think youre crowd-
 ing em of course you play some-a few
 minutes at a time maybe not enough to
 earn a letter

   lash nodded savagely i begin to see
 and i keep my mouth shut about this arm

   sure otherwise the playersll know
 youre just a dud and theyll slack off
 an lose games the fat one shook his
 head sympathetically dad knows and i
 know itll be tough for you if the students
 get the idea youre just a show-off-what
 we called shock troops in the war good
 for a spurt but not enough stamina to see
 it through but dad figures youll do it-
 an now ive looked you over i think so
 too remember youll be keeping this
 team on edge and i dont mean perhaps

   lash nodded sure i see and its
 okay with me i wont mind what the
 players and the students may think

 only- he met the trainers eye you


basketball stories

keep your lips buttoned do you well
do you know miss cavan-moira cavan

  sure her an mes like this he
held up two hugging fingers then he
blinked and nodded slowly oh like
that and so 

  does she know-about this arm

  the trainer shook his head sadly dad
says no but say shes no fool fine
girl you could do worse leave it to
her to figure it out

  lash thought he would then as he
turned in to his rooming house after the
game had ended-taylor  rittenden 
-he remembered the incident that had
probably impelled dad to take vandy
porter from the game on an impulse he
ran up the steps and sought out his land-
lady

 do you know where moira cavan
lives he asked her

  i do that she responded warmly
and are you a friend of moiras 

  er-hardly but i have some impor-
tant information  ought to give her right
away

  the motherly woman smiled ill find
ye her phone number she said and was
as good as her word

  lash waited nervously as the call went
through then he heard the mellow voice
of moira cavan its john lash he
told her can i see you for a few minutes
tonight 

  the wire was silent for a moment
then its late said the girl firmly

  its important said lash

  thats your story retorted the girl
however-youll find me on the porch if
you hurry

  lash hurried he was a trifle out of
breath as he sank down on a settee beside
moira cavan he wandered if that was
because he had been walking fast

  theres something id like to explain
he began plunging in without salutation
its about your nodding to me at the
game tonight

  well asked moira cavan tartly is
that a crime

  no no but porter was taken out of
the game because of it

  the girl bent forward with a frown
john lash have you been drinking
what why no lash grasped a
handkerchief and mopped his forehead

its very complicated you see i was
told that youre vandy porters girl   
he stopped aghast the girls brown
eyes were snapping i suppose vandy
porter told you that she said hotly

  no he didnt

  she subsided ive gone to dances with
vandy-but im nobodys girl under-
stand that mr lash

  yes all right but lets agree that
vandys interested in you he happened
to see you nodding to me tonight and it dis-
tracted his attention so that he missed a
pass right after that coach brill took
him out of the game and put me in i feel
a little guilty and-i decided to ask you
if you could explain to dad brill you
see vandy wouldnt and i-well i
wouldnt want to say anything about you
without your permission to any  

  john lash the girls exclamation
stopped him you know a player isnt
supposed to be looking anywhere except at
the play however i suppose you wont
be happy unless something is done ill-
ill attend to it

  ah-er-thanks then ill be going
miss   

  dont hurry she eyed him amusedly
im not considered such poor company by
most of my visitors

  its not that i think youre swell
lashs eyes glowed then he gulped
squirmed and -finally grinned feebly meet-
ing her eye it was the girl who looked
away a warm color showing in her face
under the moonlight and the street light
hurriedly she changed the subject you
played well tonight

  he nodded reluctantly thats my job
i guess you know

  what do you mean

  why-dont you-oh well i mean-
taylor expects every man to do his duty
that sort of thing

  of course and maybe youll be a
regular soon

  lash said nothing to that the girl
didnt know he rose slowly moira if
youre nobodys girl could i-may i   
she laughed mr lucky lefty lash
she said dont be in such a hurry to con-
sider yourself that lucky she chuckled
at his confusion and he thought her laugh
was the most musical sound he had ever
heard she laid slender fingers on his arm
sureshot



come to see me again if you can spare a
few minutes from your baskets and your
brooms

 he walked away with elation and
gloom struggling to dominate his whirling
thoughts

iv

dad brill played a canny game
hed call john lash to him near a
foul line and while the whole squad
watched hed turn him loose on the baskets
free throws from the foul line quick field
goals in rapid succession then hed hustle
the lad off to the bench

  or maybe hed throw him in with ran-
dalls second team and see to it that lash
had a few chances to score on the varsity
but only for a few minutes

  he had the squad wondering wonder-
ing if lash was being groomed for a varsity
spot or for a super-substitute and he had
the varsity wondering too often bart
edwards puzzled glance left the play to
find lash on the bench and as for vandy
porter that normally light-hearted wise-
cracker had turned gloomy and savage the
varsity was tightened up

  edwards sensed this and so did big
tom kirkland both felt that lash de-
served-credit or blame ruefully the
two agreed that it was hard to say what
with vandy porter biting their heads off
at every turn and martin and disston de-
manding to know what style of play if
any could be followed with the constant
threat of lunatic left-hander hanging over
them

  they sought out lash lefty said
bart edwards youre good for us you
stir us up maybe the stirring turns us
sour but after all vinegar has more bite
than honey id like to see more of you
off the court hows if you drop in on me
an evening

  for a moment lash was tempted then
he thought if i say yes dad brills whole
scheme may blow up i might talk in an
unguarded moment and on the heels of
that thought came the suspicion that ed-
wards after all might be just feeling him
out-masking a snare under a hearty in-
vitation he shook his head

thanks cap he said im pretty

-basketball stories-winter

busy heavy course and work and prac-
tice on top of it thats a lot anyhow
edwards acknowledging the explana-
tion accepted the rebuff with equanimity
kirkland trying another tack got the same
result

  im in engineering lucky he said
slowly anything i can do notes and that
sort of thing  

  thanks kirk ill remember

  lash remembered but he held warily
aloof from his squad acquaintances he
took the floor less often for practice when
he saw that dad brill was pleased with the
varsitys pickup he spent lonely hours
in the evenings and bore down on his
studies to ease his lonesomeness fearful
that his listless actions on the court might
convince her that he was giving up easily
in the struggle for team honor he stayed
away from moira cavan

  he could not know that she was puzzled
and concerned by his strange conduct pri-
vately she had spoken to dad brill about
vandy porters defection and john lashs
odd defense of the dashing forward

  brill had chuckled the lefty kid
evidently thinks that if a player misses a
pass because hes looking at you the de-
fense may plead extenuating circum-
stances

  now dad she said dont you go
poking fun at my fatal beauty

  fatal to taylors chances if the whole
team took to keeping an eye on you say
is young lash looking your way too
not lately she said

  oho do you tell me that the sweeper
of floors has swept you off your feet
dad brill she turned on him
stormily

  with a feeble cry of protest brill raised
a shielding arm and beat a retreat through
the door outside he chuckled little
moira well hes a good lad    taking
his medicine without a whimper

dad brill knew what bitter medi-
cine could taste like he had tasted
it often and in the next few days he tasted
a double dose taylor won two games
with john lash on the bench but the first
taken from the cellar champions showed
only a six-point edge and the second went
to overtime before the varsity came to
life and scored a single goal
	basketball stories

  then moira cavan stepped into dad
brills gloomy picture she cornered the
coach  a rainy afternoon and faced him
with determination

  what now he asked feebly

  albert university she retorted three
nights from now theyre fast can tay-
lor win this one

  well

  well what you need is a surprise
package-something to stun the albert
team and wake up the varsity now this
is what ive worked out she laid three
diagrams down on the desk before him

he studied them keenly hm    all
the passes go to the right john lash eh
she nodded hes sure-fire when hes
anywhere near the basket on the right side
you know that

  hm and how about players b and
c he indicated the letters on one dia-
gram

  randall and struve

  struves a guard

  but you need a guard for these plays
one man to screen-and randall is a swell
passer struve to break up the opposing
passes and randall for the passes to lash
youd have me take out the whole
varsity forward line

  and wouldnt they burn up she
laughed merrily this would be just to
stir things up dad and get a few early
scores then put the varsity back in-and
how theyd dig

  hm    maybe they would yes i
guess they would ill think it over and
decide whether youre just trying to make
young lefty into a hero all for yourself
he ducked a swing of a dainty fist and
laughed

the campus buzzed the varsity had
cracked three subs would start the
game with albert

  dad had thought it over and at once
he had begun practice with randall lash
and struve on the forward line and the
veterans martin and disston in the guard
spots jaws agape the five had started
in sccret on dads new plays while ed-
wards kirkland and porter exchanged wry
glances outside the court

  the plays were simple-but nothing like
any taylor attack in years so they should
shock the albert hoopsters to their gum

heels taylor had always had two for-
wards now taylor had only one-john
lash all the plays feinted to the foul
lane or the left corner then shifted fast
to the right and lash and his good left
hand

  patiently dad brill went through the
new series with his revamped team then
he called in edwards porter kirkland
gorlitz and meek swore them to secrecy
and sent the teams together for twenty
minutes with only a few rest periods he
kept them at it while his eyes glowed

  the day of the game arrives-and with
it the morning papers on the way to his
first class lash bumped into porter and
disston

  hi lefty called porter seen the
paper they sure made you the hero
photo and everything

  lash paused surprised he scarcely no-
ticed that disston had muttered a sharp
reprimand to porter no havent seen
em yet later thanks then he went
on

  he saw them later much later and his
cheeks burned his picture was there all
right just a head with a gangling figure
in gym shirt pants and shoes drawn below
it-and a gigantic broom in its hands the
caption read can lucky lefty sweep al-
bert away

  for a moment he thought of vandy
porter and the malicious smile he had dis-
played and of risstons muttering he
shrugged then suddenly he thought of
moira cavan this stuff-this publicity
stuff it came out of the athletic direc-
tors office didnt it and it would be
dad brills work an angry pulse beat
and shook the fingers that held the paper
so that was the way she thought of it too
he went to practice with a cold eye for his
teammates and plunged savagely into the
trick plays randall eyed him curiously
but said nothing nor did the others only
dad brill inquired mildly feeling a little
nervous son

  lash shook his head feeling fine
coach all ready

  the crowd was ready too ready for
whatever surprise might come but not
quite ready for the flurry of play that
struck at the first jump and whipped the
albert defense to a frazzle

  tt was randall to struve and over the
sureshot



court to lash and back to randall while
lash raced for his corner and then the
sizzling pass to lefty-and the long loop-
ing shot that hung up a score for taylor
in the first few seconds of play

  the crowd roared randall slapped lash
gleefully and the aroused albert men
glared at him kept watching him as the
jump came

  but dad had mixed his plays randall
and struve feinted hard and persistently
and drew the albert defense in first a
dribble by struve then he pivoted sent
the ball to randall as struve moved up
randall to lash and across the court to
struve again and then the pass to lash
where an albert guard still hung on the
guard tried to screen but lash whipped
over an overhand lob that the astonished
guard could only watch in its passage it
sailed high and came down dead to the
hoop taylor  albert 

  dad brill left them in for a frenzied
five minutes while the score went up then
they trotted off lash and randall and
struve while the crowd cheered them again
and again taylor  albert  lefty
hi lefty lash  the taylor side roared
blissfully

  there were more cheers as the half
ended and edwards kirkland and porter
came into the locker room almost as winded
as martin and disston who had played the
whole half the regulars had added six
points while albert had gleaned four ed-
wards eyed lash quizzically you gave
us a hot pace lefty and look what its
done to us he panted in exaggerated
style

  porter favored lash with an unfathom-
able look which the slender left-hander
caught out of the corner of his eye he
nodded silently

  dad brill came over martin spoke up
went pretty well coach is this the
regular thing

  no brill spoke shortly it wouldnt
work if they were looking for it you
old-timers will start the next game fact
is im dropping lash from the squad

  the team went out and lash was alone
the squat little trainer came around and
silently worked on the ailing arm lash
was grateful for his silence there was
nothing to talk about

  he was just a flash in the pan to the

campus-a show-off who couldnt stick
through a game he was just a broomster
to moira cavan

  and to coach brill he wasnt even worth
having on the squad

v

as he emerged from a late afternoon
class john lash got a call to sec the
director of athletics he looked at the
penciled scrawl that a freshman had
handed him and marveled then he grim-
aced and strode over to the administra-
tion building

  moira cavan was at her desk she gave
him a bright look and stared when he
grunted got a call he laid the slip
before her and stood avoiding her eyes

  she said yes youre to go right in
he walked past without a glance at her
unaware that she had turned in amaze-
ment to watch him

  in the inner office was dad brill and
a weazened little man with a bright stare
hello john said brill heres a scien-
tist wants to look you over doctor this
is our freak

  lash glared at brill then at the doctor
then he swung on his heel and made for
the door

  hey shouted brill wait a minute
lash paused half turned well he
grated if im a freak at least i can
refuse to be put on exhibition

  brill shook his head gosh lefty i
didnt think youd be so touchy you see
i couldnt tell you about it until it was
all settled the doctor here wants to look
at that arm thinks he might work it into
shape

  lashs hat dropped to the floor no-
no foolin he gasped

  brill grinned waved an arm doctor
blankenship this is our john lash look
him over

  the good doctor did just that after
twenty minutes of pushing and prying
from spine to fingertips he nodded cheer-
ily two weeks of intensive treatment
and it may be as good as ever he assured
lash and the coach in the meantime
no work for this member he handed
lash a card see me tomorrow afternoon
at four without another word he picked
up a hat and departed
	basketball stories

  lash heaved a deep breath then he
turned to brill was that why you

dropped me 

  sure why strain the arm when it
needs rest the doc tipped me off to drop
you even before hed seen it

  an idea struck lash hojv about his
fee

  there wont be any brill replied
promptly its a game with the doc when
he finds an unusual case he works free
hed pay to get it if he had to

  well thats fine in the meantime its
still a secret

  sure brills eyes crinkled we can
pass the word when the arm is okay

  lash walked out on air he even for-
got that moira cavan was sitting in the
outer office and passed by without turn-
ing his head causing that assured young
woman to sit up in her chair and stare
after him with color mounting to her
cheeks

  taylor won two games but john lash
hardly noticed it other hands wielded
a broom in the gymnasium so he had not
even a glimpse of his battleground he
studied and met the doctor daily and his
evenings were devoted to a contented
nursing of that slowly easing right arm
two weeks went by

  and the doctor looked up from a long
examination

  will it be all right asked lash
anxiously

  the doctor grunted if you dont run
it through a wringer he said dryly he
patted the arm try it out on a basket-
ball maybe ill come around to see it in
action

  lash walked fast to the gymnasium
he caught dad brill in the act of sending
the squad to the lockers and waited the
last player trotted off and dad turned
its okay the doc says i can open up
brill nodded report for practice to-
morrow

if it was a big moment for lash it was
as big a shock to the squad they
rolled their eyes at him as he came into
the locker room the following afternoon

  hi fella porter greeted him who
let you in

  im back lash assured him on
the squad

  good enough porters smile was
hearty beside him bart edwards grum-
bled now weve got to speed up again
say whats this about your having had
a glass arm

  little meek appeared at the door hey
fellas see what the afternoon papers
say about lash say lefty the paper
has it all-about your bad arm and how
you couldnt play without wearing it
down

  a dozen hands grabbed the paper lash
grinned happily he found it rather pleas-
ant being a hero

  then he saw the front page

  there was his photograph and under
it another figure a work of the artist a
gangling figure in gym suit-with two
brooms one in each hand that girl again
   darn her thought lash

  on the court he put moira cavan out
of his mind and set himself to practice
with a savage vigor he missed two tries
from the foul line and came close to miss-
ing the third then the second team lined
up against the varsity

  randall and gorlitz played fast ball and
meek and struve did their full share
halfway through the short game though
lash realized with a start that they had
not scored once on the varsity he was
strangely worried by the time the coach
blew his wrhistle

  randall jogged his elbow no scores
today lefty maybe the doc was work-
ing for the enemy

  lash shook his head but there was
something wrong he could feel it what
had become of that old sureness that
sense of having the old ball in the bas-
ket where he wanted it of course it
was naturally a little difficult to get used
to shooting with both hands but prac-
tice would remedy all that

vi

but practice didnt straighten it out
long periods on the waxed floor of-
ten with only the echoing walls applauding
his rare shots through the basket wore at
lashs nerves he was getting no better
he was losing his confidence

  dad brill saw it and spoke to him
dont get all het up kid maybe it will
come back when you start a game when
sureshot	i

 taylor lined up against the strong ritten-
 den team again lash was up front with
 porter switching over to the left side dad
 was giving him a chance to show what he
 could do under fire

  but lash didnt do much his mind
seemed as awkward as his arms ritten-
den broke fast and lash saw the flashing
plays as in a dream

   he ground his heel on the floor in dis-
 may where was that shooting skill he
 drove into the play with bitter fury it
 was no good his body wouldnt work for
 him

   it was porter who snaked past a ritten-
 den man pivoted then shot a beauty
 taylor  rittenden 

   lash grinned wryly at his fellow for-
ward you get the brooms vandy

   i wont keep em long if you get go-
 ing kid

   the words were lightly spoken but they
 cut deep lash flushed would he get
 started that was the thing

  when the half ended the scoreboard
showed taylor  rittenden 

   in the locker room dad brill eyed lefty
 gloomingly whats the matter kid

   there was nothing lash could say he
could feel miserable and that was about all

   the second half was a furious milling
of taylor light-blue and rittenden red
but all that john lash saw was red

  taylor won by the scanty margin of
three points

   porter gave him a half-hearted slap on
 the back as they trotted off the floor
 youre out of practice thats all kid

   my being out of practice kept the boys
 from making a decent showing

   porter shrugged every team goes sour
 once in a while so does every player

 but maybe ive turned sour for good
thought lash

  he met moira cavan on the walk the
day after the rittenden game she stopped
looked him in the eye you seem to have
stopped sweeping mister lash she re-
marked

  he smiled crookedly brooms wear
out he lifted his hat slapped it on
again and walked on leaving her stand-
ing there

  edwards started the next game with
john lash on the bench and taylor
scraped through again as in other games

with a long agony of suspence for the
taylor rooters and a meager margin at the
finish sign pointed to strong midston
chewing them up

  moira cavan sought out the captain
she talked long and earnestly while bart
edwards nodded his blond head it cant
hurt to try he agreed come on well
pop it on dad brill

  the grizzled old coach was slightly
dubious but receptive enough you think
thats it he asked looking keenly from
one to the other

  i think so said edwards that and
the fact that hes feeling like a worm
the squad gave him a bad razzing while he
was going good now that hes lost his
grip he thinks were being kind to him
hm said dad and maybe hes had
a bad time in other quarters he didnt
look at moira cavan but he knew the
telltale color was mantling her cheeks dad
was like that he could see things without
looking okay he said well try him
once more well give him a shot at mid-
ston

vii

lash was so discouraged he hardly
knew what he was doing as the squad
filed into the court for the midston game
the balcony was jammed spectators
stood elbow to elbow in solid ranks against
the wall taylor and midston and all their
cohorts were on hand for the big the
crucial game

  lash sank down on the bench between
randall and struve half-heartedly he
glanced around annoyed to find himself
looking for a familiar face there she was
radiant and eager she had been watching
waiting for him to turn and now she
smiled but lash kept on his wooden face

  you might give the babe a tumble
struve said grinning at win

  i dont like the stuff she writes said
lash

  what stuff

  the business about the brooms
  moira didnt write that

she didnt write it but its her idea it
started as sort of a silly business between
the two of us now its spread all over
struves dark eyes snapped dont be
a darned fool do you think youre the
	basketball stories

only one who could see a gag in the broom
stuff ruskins been working that stuff
up he didnt mean anything by it but
some of us told him to lay olf on account
of youre being kind of touchy these
days

  lashs face was in a glow is that
straight dope

  struve snorted angrily but his eyes still
held a friendly look why should i
bother to lie about it

  the smile that came over lashs tightly
drawn face was good to see thanks
fella he said thanks for keeping me
from being a worse fool than i naturally
am

  oh youre all right said struve

  but lash didnt hear him he was
standing waving and smiling at moira
cavan she made a face at him and then
she smiled back

  almost at the same instant he felt a
heavy hand on his shoulder and turned
to find dad brill frowning at him stand
up lefty the coach produced a length
of laundry line from a side pocket he
began to thread it through lashs belt
on the right side then he ran it up to
lashs elbow wound it round and round
and tied it with a neat bow

  lash gaped juggled his arm whats
that for

  brill grinned youre just a one-
handed man tonight son

  you mean-im to play

  with your left hand brill shook a
finger warningly all you have to do is
shoot the boys will feed you

  the-the varsity  panic struck lash
and his knees began to tremble i-i
cant do it coach

  brill gave the left arm a pat i think
you can so do bart edwards and moira
cavan it was their idea

  bart and moira lashs head was
whirling

  yeah everybody thinks you ought to
go good if you can hit your stride re-
member-shoot that ball get going kid
porter and kirkland were waiting on
the shining hardwood get this fast
lefty were playing ball tonight were
feeding to you porter punched him in the
ribs big stuff fella well jump these
midstons and how

  lash gulped feeding to me he
looked from one to the other they
nooded grinning he grinned back he
was far too scared to speak

  referee and midston players had turned
to stare at lash and his bound right arm
the crowd too had spotted the strange
business an excited murmur rose and
swelled into a roar lefty lash go it
lucky lash lash

  the referee tossed the ball   

  in a daze but with feet and hands that
seemed suddenly his own again lash
crouched as kirkland missed the full slap
but the ball seeming to fall wide of porter
got no farther than vandys outstretched
fingers he shot to lash the gray-eyed
rope-wound speedster dribbled and swooped
to the right a midston guard swung out
from the end line-too late to do more than
watch as lash his gray eyes gleaming
swung his left hand back and hooked the
ball far and true it swished through the
net and fell to bounce undisturbed as the
midston men stood measuring that distance
with their eyes jaws dropping in their un-
belief

  they rallied-the men in the orange
shirts-and fought for the next play they
passed across court down court-and lost
the ball as george disston flicked it at a
tangent to martin martin hurled to big
tom kirkland and the second of the lucky
lefty plays came into being with a
wham

  a feint to porter a flip to lash and
back to kirk then lash raced free-and
caught the whizzing pass from porter he
set him breathing fast right arm dang-
ling at his side a chest-shove lofting
over a midston guard a spread fingers
down to the hoop and through

  from the taylor ranks welled a boom-
ing cheer lefty lash lash

  and in the center of the court lefty
lash stood with his heart beating high
porter and kirkland were slapping him
and chortling were on the way kid
were on the way

  big tom cut in everything all right
lefty

  lash breathed deep everything he
answered and a song seemed to sound
somewhere within him everything its
a clean sweep
the two-in-one victory

by harry goldberg

a championship looms mighty big for a day or
a week a mans self-victory lasts as long as he
lives-and longer

a sudden silence fell like a swift- it was a long shot-from mid-floor and
dropping curtain over the spectators it was the last quarter of the danville-
in the basketball pavilion all eyes graham game and danville was only
were focused on the guard of the danville four points ahead thus the sudden tense
team who balancing the ball delicately on hush of the audience

the tips of his fingers was posing for a henry young danvilles big guard held
shot at the enemys basket	the ball he crouched quickly came up


	basketball stories

and shot the ball arched through the air
while thousands of anxious eyes followed
its course then the lace under the hoop
waved gently the ball had gone through
without even touching the iron rim

  the spectators yelled their approval
some laughed for young had been drop-
ping in those long throws with uncanny
regularity all evening anyone witnessing
this game would have agreed that young
was the big gun of the danville team

  but youngs great shot seemed to have
had an opposite effect on capt ben tillson
center on the team the latter bit his lip
his face flushed impatiently he brushed
back the dark brown hair which had fallen
into his eyes for a moment his brown
eyes followed young who was trotting back
to his position the eyes held no approval
in them were disgust and a slight trace of
despair

  another man who had viewed youngs
shot otherwise than joyfully was coach
fred ackerman sitting with the substi-
tutes on the long wooden bench that bor-
dered the floor the coachs teeth clamped
together and from his throat there issued
a guttural sound not unlike a growl the
coach was mad and he took no pains to con-
ceal the fact

  the game ended a few minutes later and
danville had won the opening fracas of the
season by three points as the spectators
filed out they commented mainly upon
youngs marvelous shooting which had
outshone his equally great guarding

  in the dressing-room captain tillson
emerged from an icy shower and came face
to face with the coach

  see me before you leave ben the
coach said

  tillson nodded okay coach

  ben knew what the coach wanted to dis-
cuss with him-young it was a vexing
problem one that added greatly to a cap-
tains worries ben finished dressing and
approached the coach

  i guess you know what i want to talk
about ackerman began abruptly its
about young

  you know the facts of the case the
coach continued youngs ruining our
team every time he gets his hands on the
ball he shoots ill admit hes a great long-
distance shooter but that only makes it
worse for the rest of them the other fel-

lows are disheartened and instead of hav-
ing a smooth offense i have one man hog-
ging the ball and four others knowing
theyre not going to get a pass losing in-
terest in the game

  all through the month of practice we
had young did the same thing you know
how our forwards harter and king com-
plained that even when they were free and
yelled to young to pass how he deliber-
ately took a long heave himself

  and you know too ben that i dont
dare take young out hes the best guard
in this tri-state league if we hope to
win the pennant which we havent done
since the league was started well have to
have better teamwork than we had tonight
tonights game was played by graham col-
lege versus henry young of danville but
on the other hand if we want to cop the
tri-state pennant well have to stop the
forwards of quaker valley or johnstown
and youngs the only man who can stop
them

  the coach wiped the perspiration from
his forehead the dressing-room was
steamy and talking called for energy

  ben was gazing at the opposite wall in a
meditative manner

  wonder what makes him play lone-
handed he asked slowly

  dont know the coach replied ive
warned him time and again to remember
there were others on the floor wearing dan-
villes uniforms i thought when the sea-
son started he would be satisfied to play
the stellar game at guard he did last year
but this season it looks like he wants to
combine his position with that of a for-
ward

  do you think benching him would do
any good  ben inquired

  i doubt it we couldnt do without his
guarding the team has disappointed me
this year with being so weak defensively
and whats worse young knows we need
him

  ben shook his head its tough ill say
just now i cant think of anything we
might do

  ackerman rose the talk had come to
an unsatisfactory end as ben was about
to leave the coach called after him if you
think of anything let me know

  all right ben called back and a mo-
ment later the door closed behind him
the two- is-oise victory	

but as the season wore on bens mind
was destitute of any plan to change
youngs ways and the guard became the
sensation of the league

  danville didnt win all of its games
sometimes youngs shooting was off and
in those games danvilles scoring was
brought to a near standstill

  danvilles opponents were having an ex-
ceptionally hard time rolling up scores of
their own young was outdoing himself
at guard time and again when the oppo-
nents attack swept into danvilles territory
ben thought a basket must surely result
but almost every time he was agreeably
surprised to find young looming large un-
der the basket coolly intercept a pass slap
the ball from the hands of an intended
shooter or after the enemy had let go a
long toss take the ball as it bounced off
the banking board and dribble away

  then the fun would begin fun for
the spectators but not for ben or his team-
mates

  once young secured possession of the
ball as he almost always did he would
either fake a heave to one of the forwards
hovering expectantly near the opponents
basket or stand still a minute until the
other team ran to its defense formation

slowly he would dribble to the mid-
dle of the floor then once inside the
ring where the centers jumped he would
take deliberate aim and start the ball on an
arching drive and often the ball would
find the hole and two points would be cred-
ited to danvilles score

  sometimes in the heat of the game ben
would yell whats the matter with you
pass that ball

  the other players would snarl at him
they taunted him grandstander and
quit hogging that ball

  but young would only smile a light
fleeting smile that touched his lips a mo-
ment and then was gone back to his po-
sition he would go while thunderous ap-
plause followed him

  but dissension was bound to make its
appearance it came one day after practice
when four of the squad harter and king
forwards lake a sub-forward and fill-
more the running guard gathered in one
corner of the dressing-room for a while
they talked in low tones then they arose

and came to the captain who had just fin-
ished dressing

  ben looked up in surprise at their ap-
proach a feeling of uneasiness shot
through his body and drew his features
into a worried frown the faces of the
four men were grim their lips were set

  harter spoke

  ben i guess weve stood it long enough
were not needed on the team young
can do all the playing by himself were
willing to stay if young is put off other-
wise were through

  ben stood up and looked steadily from
one to the other finally he spoke to
harter

  youre talking through your hat guy
come down to earth

  you heard us before harter replied
will you or will you not ask coach to yank
young from the lineup

  thats a threat harter why dont
you go to coach direct

  ackerman wouldnt listen to us youre
playing with us on the same team you
can feel as we do and besides you have
more influence with the coach than we
have

  ben coaxed them to stay he pleaded
until his patience left him but harter
and the others refused to budge at last
he lost his temper and burst out in a low
hot fury

  you guys are not only yellow youre
jealous it galls you when young gets the
applause you want that ball because youll
get the baskets and the credit youre
nothing but a bunch of grandstanders your-
selves 

the coach entered the dressing-room
at this moment and sidled over to the
group ben glanced up in surprise at the
latters unexpected entry this together
with the calling down he had just given the
squad made him nervous so that now his
hands were trembling and his lips dry

  before anyone had a chance to speak
further ben called out come over here
young

  a moment later a six-foot broad-shoul-
dered iron-muscled man pushed through
the congregated players young had blue
eyes and light wavy hair hands on hips
he surveyed ben

  well 


basketball stories

  he was cool calculating almost cynical
one would have judged the captain
shorter by two inches and slenderer was
impulsive his regular features tightened
his face burned a slight red as he flung at
the big guard

  young answer me this question why
do you insist in spite of being repeatedly
warned on playing the kind of game you
do you know what i mean-hogging the
ball and all that

  why i dont mind telling you young
said he almost drawled his words i
take most of the shots because this year i
want to lead in the tri-state league scor-
ing usually the player who heads the
scoring list is voted the most valuable player
in the league

  ben knew the guard had spoken the
truth so a players desires were wrecking
the team

  while young was talking the coach re-
garded him gravely almost somberly

  young looked calmly from face to face
bens eyes were smoldering they seemed
ready to burst into flames the air was
tense

  now you cant say we havent got a
good reason for wanting to quit harter
burst out furiously he jerked a contemp-
tuous thumb at young hes playing the
game for himself

  were getting results though arent
we young sneered we happen to be
in first place and not on account of your
efforts either

  ackerman broke in in striking con-
trast his voice was cool-cold it seemed
to the impassioned outbursts of ben till-
son and harter

  this matter has gone far enough its
time for me to say something

  harter theres no need for you or
king or fillmore or lake to hand in your
uniforms

  the coach turned to face young their
eyes met were locked the coachs voice
was like pelting shot

  young hereafter youll sit on the bench
blaine will take your place if you want
to quit im ready now to have you tell me
youngs face showed no emotion its
all right he spoke in his usual slow way
the bench for me lightly he shrugged
his big shoulders and walked away

  coach ackerman had done his best to

keep the team together but his latest effort
had struck a terrific blow at danvilles pen-
nant chances

  before young had been benched the dan-
ville team had been tied for first place with
quaker valley last years champions now
the team dropped three games in a row and
slid into second notch

  graham ran through a feeble danville
defense to pile up over forty points
quaker valley came next and in a night-
mare that lasted an hour the former champs
chalked up sixty-eight points quaker
valley went into first place

  with young out of the way the danville
offense functioned for the first time for
more than a few minutes and it wasnt at
all bad

  at center ben inspired his mates he
took nearly every tipoff often grabbing the
ball after he had jumped for it harter
king and fillmore rounded out a smooth
combination

  but there was no defense worthy of
mention blaine was a green youngster
without previous varsity experience he
was willing but his willingness availed him
little and fillmore was failing to cover
his man

coach ackerman came in for a
good bit of panning the papers
pointed out that young was the star of the
team he had far outscored his team-
mates the year before he had been cho-
sen on the all-state team and this year he
was surpassing previous performances on
the danville campus the coach was freely
critcized and at the games the students
hissed him mercilessly when he made his
appearance

  then came the biggest upset of the year
the last place ambridge team definitely
out of the running for the tri-state pen-
nant was able to beat danville after a most
miserable exhibition of defensive work by
the latter

  after that game the coach sought out
ben the team mentor was plainly wor-
ried

  say ben he asked anxiously do you
think we ought to put young back in
we cant go on much longer like this

  that would just be scaring up the old
ghost ben replied harter and the
others would quit
the two-in-one victory	

  well then let em quit the coach de-
clared vehemently

  so young returned to the lineup
young smiling in a superior way an elo-
quent smile plainly proclaiming the fact
that danville without young was a helpless
outfit

  coach ackerman didnt announce that
young would play until the team was
dressed for the game with quaker valley
and ready to go out to the floor then
seemingly as an afterthought he remarked
young you start at guard

  the crowd gave the team a noisy wel-
come and when the subs had gone to the
bench leaving the starting five on the floor
young was cheered by name

  quaker valleys attack collapsed it
could reach young and no further not a
basket did they score in the first quarter
young looped three successive shots from
mid-floor

                          

scarcely a word was said by the
danville players as they gathered to-
gether during a time out called by quaker
valley harters lips were compressed
he looked around anxiously at the players
it did not take keen observation to see that
all but young were displeased

  ben tried to lessen the tension

  lets hold em this quarter fellows
king watch your man a bit more closely
lets try to get our passing attack started
he glanced significantly at young

  to all appearances the guard didnt hear
him he lay flat on his back knees drawn
up his hands shaded his eyes from the
lights so that ben could not see his face
very clearly

  weve got to get them on the run ben
continued as the air seemed to tighten
about them work the ball in close and
dont miss your shots

  harter snickered  fillmore grinned deri-
sively fortunately the whistle shrilled
then and the players scatted to their
positions

  quaker valley played viciously a vic-
tory by danville would put the two teams
within a game of each other the playing
became faster the fans were kept on edge
quaker valley managed to get a basket-
her only one of the half-but young
bagged two while king counted a third

  ben was glad when the rest between

halves was over only the coach had spoken
a few words for the rest of the time there
had been silence-a grim foreboding si-
lence

  danville played cautiously in the third
period maintaining its nine-point lead in
the last quarter quaker valley realizing
that only a determined rally would over-
come danvilles lead started her most ef-
fective thrusts

  and it was in the last quarter that young
rose to glorious heights

  aiken the star forward of the tri-state
league dribbled past king he rounded
in toward the basket

  ben lunged at the ball and missed aiken
drew up to shoot then with ridiculous
ease young reached out and snatched the
ball

  that was only the beginning a few
times quaker valleys forwards got the
ball to danvilles foul line seldom any
farther

  young totaled five baskets that period
once a quaker valley man rushed at him
but young without taking time to aim
heaved the ball from nearly three-quarters
of the floor the ball hit the banking
board just above the basket then dropped
in a spontaneous roar burst from the
crowd

  danville was within striking distance of
first place

  just as ben had feared harter an-
nounced his intention of quitting as the
danville forward turned to leave ben
grabbed his shoulder

  listen hart i want you to promise
me youll wait a few days

  what for harter demanded itll
be the same old story

  just till next game ben urged do
it for the school if for nothing or nobody
else

  all right harter yielded grudgingly

  ben walked slowly to his rooms he
had to think of something that would keep
the squad from open rebellion the prob-
lem was simple-discouragingly simple
here was a man in the lineup who was win-
ning danvilles games and at least four
others resented this mans method of
playing

  yet the captain knew how foolish it
would be to remove young from the regu-
lar squad danville could hardly hope to
	basketball stories

stop quaker valleys or johnstowns offen-
sives without the big guard

  yes the problem was simple it was to
keep young in the lineup along with harter
and king and fillmore

  ben didnt for a moment think of asking
the coach to allow harter and the others to
hand in their uniforms that wasnt the
way to do things victories werent to be
desired for themselves they were means
not ends

  ben wanted mightily to win the tri-state
pennant the team was made up of sea-
soned veterans and ben as captain had
the greatest reasons for piloting his team
to the championship

  of course harter would have to stay
but so would young both would have to
be satisfied

  even in the midst of this apparently
hopeless mess ben had to grin to himself

  baskets from contented players he
soliloquized

  then the solution to the problem struck
him the same evening in the midst of his
school-work the page of history faded
before his eyes

  excited he ran his hand through his
hair he punched the palm of his hand
his lips opened and closed rapidly as
though that would facilitate his mental
process

  his roommate regarded him quizzically
pin in your chair he inquired in a so-
licitous voice

  aw dry up ben replied entirely with-
out malice he was elated at having found
a probable way out of the puzzle that
threatened to disrupt the team

  he jammed on his cap struggled into
his coat got to see the coach he ex-
plained to his wondering roommate and
was gone

  the next day ben got hold of harter as
the latter was going from his classes to
practice carefully he explained to him
what he had explained to the coach the pre-
vious evening

  of course well have to wait till our
last game ben concluded but itll be
worth it the quaker valley game is the
last one on our schedule and something
tells me were going to decide the cham-
pionship with that game thatll be a
dandy time to spring our surprise on
young

  harter agreed and the matter was settled
for the time being

  meanwhile the race was narrowing down
to quaker valley danville and johnstown
quaker valley had a two-game lead over
danville in second place but all three out-
fits were conceded chances

  with young going better than ever dan-
ville took over ambridge and johnstown
in successive nights the big guard scored
nine baskets in the first game and six in
the second he went into the scoring lead
with aiken quaker valley forward trail-
ing by five points

  then graham pulled a startling upset by
defeating the first-place quaker valley
team a sensational rally near the end of
the game had given graham a one-point
lead to which the latter had held tena-
ciously until the final whistle

  interest grew to a white heat when
johnstown now considered as having little
chance to finish first administered a beat-
ing to quaker valley to top the whole
thing graham added johnstown to its list
of victims thus definitely eliminating the
latter then graham submitted to a lick-
ing by danville

  danville was now a single game ahead of
quaker valley and the schedule seem-
ingly designed by men who could forecast
the future called for a last game between
danville and quaker valley if quaker
valley won the race would be tied and a
playoff necessary if danville came out
on top she would definitely clinch the title

  ben glancing in the paper at the list of
scorers in the tri-state league saw that
young was in the lead three points ahead
of aiken

  the two highest scorers were to be pitted
against each other ben laid the news-
paper on his study table and thoughtfully
gazed out of the window his lips tight-
ened if his plan worked young might
not score a single basket

  the danville-quaker valley game was
to begin in twenty minutes

  in the danville dressing-room ackerman
was finishing his talk

  dont let aiken inside the foul line he
never misses his short shots

  harter brushed past ben and slid out of
the side of his mouth dont forget now
ben nodded

  then all was ready basketball in the
basketball stories	

crook of his arm ben placed himself at the
head of the line of players lets go he
said gruffly and they ran with easy strides
on to the floor

  quaker valley was already on the floor
ben glanced at them and thought they
looked especially formidable but that was
due to a momentary nervousness

  then the referees whistle blew ben
shook hands with the other center and the
game was on

  ben leaped tapped the ball to harter
who passed to king king shot the ball
to fillmore traveling at top speed and the
latter already under the basket completed
an easy counter a basket in the first ten
seconds

  but quaker valley was not caught nap-
ping  on the next play kings pass was in-
tercepted and quaker valley turned loose
its offensive

  aiken took a pass in the corner and shot
from that difficult angle he missed
young grabbed the ball

  immediately harter king and fillmore
dashed forward but ben did a strange
thing he stayed by youngs side

  young dribbled slowly toward the cen-
ter of the floor and all the time ben
kept pace with him

  young crouched in a shooting position
ben stood near him

  here  he yelled

  but young pretended not to hear him
he balanced the ball on the tips of his
fingers then the crowd gasped in surprise

  just as young brought his arms up ben
leaped in front of him his arms extended
young stopped too late the ball left his
hands struck ben the latter was after it
in a flash a lightning heave to king
waiting under the net a goal

  part of the crowd cheered part hissed
most wondered

  the play speeded up danville bagged
its third basket quaker valley counted a
half-minute later the valley team shot
a foul the score was six to three in
danvilles favor

  on the next play young leaped in the
air to block a shot with the same motion
he started to dribble toward the other
basket

  once again ben stayed by his side the
guard got set but suddenly ben knocked
the ball from his hands

  youngs face went white with hate

  the danville try had failed now
quaker valley swung into the attack ben
ran toward the back court he saw
youngs pale features and guessed what
was going on in the guards mind

  quaker valley flashed a splendid attack
the passes were short and whizzing

  now a forward had it now the cen-
ter the valley players streamed past the
first line of danvilles defense

  aiken took a pass and got away young
ran him to the basket he saw he couldnt
prevent the easy shot he fouled aiken
throwing the latter off his feet

  young was desperate ben wouldnt let
him shoot and to his temporarily crazed
mind his mates were not attempting to
stop aiken

  aiken sunk both bouls young was but
one point ahead of him

  again and again in that first half ben
carried out his plan of stopping young
not one of the guards shots completed its
course

  the two teams spurted near the end of
the half play was fast and fierce spills
were frequent the crowd was on edge

  quaker valleys center counted twice in
rapid succession fillmore put in a foul
try the score was danville nineteen
quaker valley sixteen

  a little more than a minute for the first
half to go ben took die ball passed to
harter then harter to king to harter
to fillmore the latter pivoted sharply
threw a short toss to ben ben dribbled
and with perfect rhythm of body move-
ment jumped for the basket with the ball
in his hand goal

  the valley center copped the next
throw-in he passed toward the sidelines
just as the ball seemed ready to go out of
bounds aiken flashed by he dribbled up
the floor ducked young and shot at the
moment he let go the ball young fouled
him the basket counted as did the foul
aiken attempted the timekeepers pistol
cracked to end the half danville twenty-
one quaker valley nineteen

the second half banged off to a flying
start fillmore missed a shot king ran
in jumped to get the rebound and missed
he went down with two valley players

  now the opponents were coming down
	basketball stories

the floor aiken got a pass started to drib-
ble ben crossed in front of him and took
the ball

  the game continued at top speed with
most of the playing near the valley basket
there was a mixup after king had charged
in following a shot aiken emerged from
the knot of players with the ball he ran
down the floor

  the captain was two feet behind aiken

  ben saw young come out to meet the on-
coming player a body feint toward the
left and the expert dribbler passed young

  ben gained ground when aiken dodged
he caught up with him then just as
aiken began lifting the ball for the basket
ben shouldered him out of bounds

  the referee called the foul ben
straightened up and looked at young the
guard was regarding him with a sort of
wonderment aiken missed his free shot

  ben caged the next basket but quaker
valley bucketed the following two to tie
the score at twenty-three all king counted
a foul to put danville one point in the lead

  quaker valley missed a shot young
pulled the ball down

  ben ranged alongside of him give
me the ball and go ahead down the floor

  young hesitated a moment ben held
his arms out for the pass their tense
figures seemed like statues ben was pray-
ing-praying for young

  young passed the ball and started to-
ward the enemys basket ben flung it to
harter standing in a far corner the
ball seemed scarcely to touch harters fin-
gers before it landed with king uncovered
under the net

  shoot the audience screamed

  an agonizing instant king held the ball
then he spun it to a whirlwind of speed
in human form-young charging in it
was an easy basket

  harter slapped youngs shoulder young
ran up to ben call time out he shrilled
above the drum-breathing din the guards
features were twitching

  ben called time out the players were
surprised a team that sets the pace sel-
dom asks for rest young faced the
players

  i called time out because i want to
apologize im a mucker a selfish unfeel-
ing mucker ive been blind all season

thought you fellows were against me

  young laid a hand on bens shoulder

  he showed me the way he fouled
aiken for me he gave me the chance to
shoot those two baskets

  ben faced the group gang from now
on were flashing the old danville attack
every man gets in it come on

  play started danville five points to the
good young stood two points in front of
aiken

  ben added a foul fillmore got a bas-
ket and a foul

  then quaker valley cut into danvilles
lead with a vengeance the valley center
looped one their guard two in swift suc-
cession aiken made one from half the
floor young made a good foul try

  young was a single marker ahead of
aiken in their total scoring danville had
a two-point lead time was nearly up
it was anybodys game

  through sheer force it seemed quaker
valley drove danville into the latters ter-
ritory a shot that missed another vain
attempt then aiken tilted it through the
hoop

  the teams were tied aiken was one
point in front of young

  the teams dropped into position for the
last time a curious silence blanketed the
pavilion

  the ball was thrown in and ben caught
it leaping high a fraction of a second he
was in the air looking round young only
was free

  ben sent the ball to the guard as usual
quaker valley ran to its defensive for-
mation

  young was in the little circle where the
centers faced off one swift glance he
gave ben

  shoot came from the captain

  the ball sailed upwards to the tortured
ben it seemed suspended in the air then
it dropped swiftly downwards in the
heavy stillness the ball made a swishing
note as it plopped through the netting

  and at that moment the pistol cracked

  danville had won the tri-state pennant
young led in the total scoring

  the players ran for their dressing-room

  great shot ben called to young

  and strangely enough young said im
sorry
