         by richard sale

            author of design for valor old uncle
            ghost etc

sure motor torpedo boats are chips not ships
slap at em and you blow em out of the water
but after the whole sea has exploded around
and under you and youre still standing up   
well they can spit-they can spit

i

battle stations

the ocean was roiled there was no sun there had
been no sun for the last three weeks only once
since the war had begun had they seen the sun
at all for the fog had an incredible permanence

  this day alternately thursday and friday as they
crossed the international date line was better than most
in that the wind was southwest and the fog had dissipated
to a scale six visibility which was extraordinary

  usually the wind came down from the north off the
drift ice of the cold bering and the warmer pacific and
when it crossed the gap where the two oceans met it
created an impulsive dewpoint which made dense fog

  head into the white horse seas which the southwest wind
licked up the motor torpedo boat pt  pounded listlessly
as she held to an economical twenty knots

  she was not alone off her port quarter some two
hundred yards was another mosquito boat maintaining the
patrol with her

  beyond that another usually the fog was so bad that
their numbers could not be read but this day they could
be seen plainly even without binoculars pt  and pt 

  they were in echelon formation on an a to b line of
bearing

  they looked slim and small and savage for the entry of
the forefoot into the crest of each sea made an explosive
burst of white water which tossed spray into the face of
the wind and the wind whipped it high over the raked
stems

  this at only twenty knots they could do fifty with
war load

  lieutenant-commander richard perry skipper of pt 
and commanding officer of the patrol stood on the exterior
bridge of his craft with his teeth held tight togetherso that
he would not bite his tongue when the boat struck each
wave

  he had never got used to the beating which she could
hand out but he had at least learned his lesson from
her around his midriff he had tightly taped himself with
adhesive to keep his insides from jostling against his lungs

he clenched his teeth he never moved aboard hr



without a grip on some projection he had even devised the
use of a strap to keep himself in his berth at night after
having been bounced out many times

  he had developed a competent skill in eating while on
his feet you only got food spilled on you sitting down it
had taken much less than the three-weeks patrol off attu
island to hate the sight of a motor torpedo boat they
were boats-not ships

derry hiked his coat around his neck and hunched his
shoulders pitying the poor devil of a quartermaster
who stared at the compass with watery eyes correcting the
course to hold bearing two two five on the lubber line

  his name was hawkins his face was red from cold and
a droplet hung from the end of his nose occasionally he
would move a foot as if it were stiff

  captain perry watched the droplet and wished it would
fall finally he looked away

  the sea was gray and ugly he thought of adams on
the engineroom watch

  pure hell down there just a mass ofmachinery gorged
with the three supercharged packards auxiliary generators
piping reverse gears controls ventilating pumps instru-
ments fresh-water cooling systems for the motors

  no room really to stand upright and a roaring inferno
of noise and vibration you had to be made of iron or
rubber to stand it

  sometimes diving into a big sea the mosquito boat
would take a slice of the wave aboard her bow it was
astonishing at the bridge to see how instantly the gray
water changed to green cascaded back from the deck and
became gray again

  the dampness was in everything perry was sick of it

  it hadnt taken him very long to dislike the mtbs it
was after all quite a change from the comfort of living
aboard a light cruiser the alaskan station was quite a
change from pearl harbor	

  pt  was a far cry from the concord which had grossed
seven thousand tons and boasted ten six-inch cannon

  he had not been in command of her of course for he
was much too young for that hadnt he always complained
in her wardroom that you had to be a methuselah before
the navy would give you a command of your own

  he shivered now repenting the words they had given
him his command all right eighty-one feet of motor
torpedo boat the rank of lieutenant-commander submarine
pay

  there was the catch submarine pay that was the
tipoff on the kind of living you enjoyed aboard a mosquito

  it was all very well to look at her slim length her tre-
menduous flare her superbly raked stem the ominous
  quartet of torpedo tubes on her aft deck the four fifty-
  caliber machine guns in two mounts amidships a lone
  depth charge astern the cute walt disney insignia on the
  port and starboard sides of the interior bridge a mosquito
  riding the back of a whitehead over a frothing crest

    but living aboard staying aboard week after week in
 rough cold seas that was something else again

  tte glanced down as his junior officer lieutenant riggs
  came up from the interior bridge to report their posi-
  tion he had taken a radio fix using the scotch cap station
  and the st paul station in the pribilhofs

    ordinarily the st paul station did not send out radio
  beacon signals except from may through october but
  since hostilities had begun navy station npr at dutch
  harbor had requested signals on certain scheduled times

    were over the line mr riggs said pleasantly did
  you see it when we crossed captain they used to tell
  me it was bright red and that you couldnt miss it anyway
  today is friday at least it has been for the last half hour
  that was the shortest thursday i ever saw

captain perry noted the ships position they used to
tell me he replied that the date line was striped like

a barber pole it always has seemed queer hasnt it this
passing from one day to another and then back to the
original day on the return youll see your short thursday
again this afternoon riggs

  mr riggs shivered at the bite of the wind im so used
to being below he said that fresh air is almost over-
powering i cant take too much of it it might spoil me
but dont get me wrong captain i still think these are
great boats

  captain perry looked pained he made no reply he
watched riggs broad back disappear down into the interior
bridge and saw the door shut securely against the winds

  great boats maybe so maybe so but they were not
ships maybe he was just soft used to good living and a
fine sun

  he glanced at his hands the coldness had brought out
the tan of the skin but even so the color was fading his
fingers were bluish

  maybe they were great boats in flat water against an
enemy stupid enough to have come that close on a sortie
they would be all right especially at night

  but as he told riggs a little later when he went below
and ordered a change of course for the little squadron on


argosy

bearing one nine zero maybe they are good boats riggs

i	never shared your admiration for them as you know i
never shared your belief in their offensiveossibilities

  i served on a cruiser and i know the fire power a
cruiser or destroyer has as compared with this chip a
cruiser or destroyer could blow us out of the water in short
order

rfhe radio man stark had communicated with the other
mtbs by means of the flea-power transmitter for inter-
communication among the squadron and the three boats
changed course southward receiving the seas on the star-
board bow and being buffeted badly

  their vee bottoms prevented grand rolling but the im-
pact of the combers created hard heavy spray which quick-
ly drenched the flying bridge

  the quartermaster took up his station inside

  riggs said i thought they were going to send these
skeeters to the philippines i didnt volunteer for the serv-
ice for alaskan scenery in a london fog

  manila was the place for them you know a hundred
of them harrying enemy sea communications would have
been a terrific threat but-oh well im not cincus only
why put us on patrol off attu island

  attu is the outpost said captain perry

  i know but the patrol bombers can cover this whole
area better and faster than we do they send them over
anyhow kiska island is no heaven on earth but at least
it has a semblance of civilization what with the main mtb
squadrons backed up by the olympia and the depot north-
star

  i have a constant horror of running out of gasoline out
here and itd be so much easier to run alongside a depot
ship and refuel instead of rolling gas tanks out of hiding
on attu and refueling there every night

  cheer up said captain perry glumly think of the
poor army up at point barrow there are worse places
than attu

  you mentioned the only one said riggs with a wry
smile

  captain perry looked amused you might be right at
that but its ours not to question why and so forth
riggs you know as much about it as i do

  intelligence is not always right and yet they have an
astonishing inside knowledge of projected operations
there was some theory that the enemy might make a thrust
in the north here and attempt to take the base at dutch
harbor which is poorly defended and garrisoned

  in two years it would have been as strong as pearl
harbor but unfortunately they did not give us that much
time

  i heard that riggs said but i dont see any sense
in it as long as the main fleet was unimpaired the enemy
would expose his whole line of communication to the guns
of an obviously superior fleet

  true but theres more wisdom in such a sortie than
youd think off-hand obviously the enemy wont be
drawn into a hands down engagement with the main fleet
the navy would like nothing better than one sweet de-
cisive battle the fleet hasnt sailed west with anything
else in mind

  but if the enemy were to land troops at one of these
alaskan bases and land enough planes and artillery to sup-
port the position it would play the very devil to dislodge
them

  their supporting naval forces would then leave them
hastily withdrawing and while our main fleet came up
over that long distance to engage them the units could
rendezvous with the main body of their own fleet and make
a concerted attack on oahu

  no one can tell what might happen as a result of that
if the enemy reduced oahu and gained possession of the
islands the main fleet would be compelled to withdraw
to the pacific coast whether they dislodged the invaders
in alaska or not

  that would mean the same as a defeat theres a
-chance of such a maneuver its daring strategy but it just
might work

  if intelligence really expected something like that
said riggs they wouldnt guard this line of march with a
mosquito squadron backed by two old destroyers and an
aircraft cruiser like the olympia

  dont be so sure of that said captain perry quietly
perhaps our defenses up this way have more aces in the
sleeve than mere mosquito boats the army may be using
the unalaska air base im afraid however that well see
little action

rfhe radio man stark came out of his shack on the star-
board side of the boat abaft the interior bridge perry
said what is it stark

  strong signals sir being heavily jammed almost un-
intelligible but im certain it was a distress call on six
hundred meters

  captain perry alert sprang to his feet at once can
we take a radio bearing on them

  unfortunately no sir theyve stopped they stopped
abruptly and the jamming stopped at the same time the
signals were very heavily jammed not one or two ships
sir the whole frequency was loaded with qrm
communicate with pt  and  by blinker tube and
see if they received the signals also make the signal to
preserve radio silence until further orders communicate
by either blinker tube or semaphore

   yes sir

  post another lookout mr riggs somethings amiss
here captain perrys jaw had a muscle jumping in it

   stark was back in a few minutes pt  reports distress
call captain he said he was excited and his eyes were
shining they managed to get a quick bearing before the
signals stopped bearing zero six two the call was to
npr in dutch harbor

  change of course said captain perry left rudder to
bearing zero six two make the signal stark fifty knots
battle stations

ii

at fifty knots

diggs sounded the alarm while the skipper rang the
-- engine room astern the quartermaster put over the
helm to port and the mosquito boat came about sharply
banking inward slightly

  her three engines roared and she went up on her step
the seas following the pounding in a following sea was
not as severe for her stem dropped sharply as she beat with
the combers and she began to cut them instead of dropping
on them

  the bow became alive with white water when her
launch torpedoes



head dropped but her speed was exciting and powerful and
the engines quickened their blood

  pt  and pt  had made their turn and where follow-
ing behind in a straight vertical formation using the flat
course of pt s white wake to advantage

  lieutenant riggs came down from the flying bridge wet
with sea not so good he said fog rolling up ahead
did you see sir

  yes said captain perry but well have plenty of
visibility for another hour damn the stuff i knew this
clear wouldnt last

  what do you think it is captain riggs said the
signal i mean

  captain perry said a patrol bomber down at sea
nothing else

  but the jamming-

  the skipper stared at him who would jam a distress
signal except enemy ships

  but behind us riggs looked stunned its a wonder
we didnt run into them this morning when we were out
this is a northeast course they had to come in behind us
between the patrol and kiska islands

   exactly which they did yesterday if they did it at all
replied the skipper his face was tight the fog was
dense yesterday not even a patrol bomber could have
spotted them

  riggs said you dont expect to find anything

   perry replied frankly no

  forty minutes later the lookout on the exterior bridge
sang out captain perry and mr riggs went topside as
the lookout repeated sail ho

  where away perry snapped

   bearing zero five five replied the lookout

  perry sighted with his binoculars the motion of the
mosquito boat made it difficult to hold the field of the
binoculars on the mark but he managed it patrol
bomber down still afloat wings awash what do you
see riggs

  riggs hands were shaking one man sir standing on
the wing waving seems to be in good shape

  stand by to pick him said perry make the signal
to the others have them stand off well go in for him

he clung to the handrail as the craft went in he
had never realized how big those planes were but he
got a striking impression now for the wingspread was at
right angles to his course and he realized what a one-
hundred-ten-foot wingspread meant

  he could make out her number on the starboard fin
which was raised in the air on a level with the wings
np  

  the man on the wing began to slosh across its slippery
aluminum surface toward them as they approached cap-
tain perry said to riggs put her stem at the edge of the
wing two men forward with a rope when we heave to
they approached at full speed which looked alarming
the survivor on the wing looked appalled but pt 
dropped from fifty knots to five in five seconds and when
her stem reached the edge of the wing she had lost all
weight completely

  the rope snaked over the flyer caught it he was
jerked up to the bow of the boat which instantly backed
off a bit turned quickly the ratings hurried him aft and
down into the forepeak through a hatch which was in-
stantly closed

  the signalman sent resume course to the other
mosquitoes arid in a minute more they were back on the
bearing at full seed

captain perry met the flyer in the enclosed bridge
lieutenant roy higgins said the flyer im the
only one thanks for picking up my remains sir i didnt
expect to get my feet out of the water again they jammed
my signals did i get through to you

  perry shook hands with him sit down make yourself
comfortable feel like talking

  im ready to rave higgins said i feel that good
captain you dont know how beautiful this boat looks
from a distance

  he gritted his teeth and tightened his stomach as pt 
picked up her speed and began to bounce he clung to a
rail for support i didnt get through

  im sure not said perry one of us managed to get
a poor bearing on you the rest was luck

utd better talk fast then i thought that npr had
a the whole story we were on patrol at five thousand
feet when we sighted an enemy fleet train

  we were attacked almost instantly by four fighters
and we didnt have much chance they boxed us and took
us apart quickly no machine guns these boys were
firing cannon

  henning-he was navigating officer-was marking their
position and course for me to send when we went i sent
it captain swanson told me to distress then he was hit

  we went on down and i radioed distress before we hit
i woke up in the sea dont know how i ever got there
but there i was

they jammed you badly said the skipper rubbing his
jaw briskly what was the last position of the fleet train
henning had just given it to me one seven eight de-
grees forty minutes east forty-nine degrees north they
were proceeding on a course zero seven four degrees true
what was the disposition

  two capital ships one aircraft carrier five cruisers
eleven destroyers six transports

  submarines

  not a one to be seen i couldnt be sure though there
might have been more destroyers that was hennings
figure

  you havent any idea of their speed

  no youll have to reckon it captain a lot of things
happened all at once upstairs he grinned i think im
a little drunk with exhilaration i cant help it no re-
action yet

  perry called stark and told him to take higgins to the
officers cabin make yourself comfortable there hig-
gins ill have something hot sent up from the galley stark
will do his best to fit you out youre more his size
higgins went along with the radio man

  riggs was busy and did not follow then he had plotted
the position of the enemy train when sighted by the patrol
bomber and its present course if it had held on

  guessing their speed at twenty knots from the cruising
speed of the capital ships which were slowest he knew
where the enemy would be at that time they had crossed
the date line back into thursday

  riggs said will you inform npr at once captain
  no captain perry said bluntly

  he took mr riggs by surprise but- riggs began
and then said yes sir
argosy

iiqurprise is the only superiority i have along with
speed perry said ill be damned if i see the
necessity of relaying the information at this moment and
completely warning the enemy of our presence

  theyre still a long way from unalaska and we can
transmit the moment we are sighted and have no further
use for radio silence until then well see about getting
a show at them by ourselves

  we could try the twenty meter amateur band riggs
said that doesnt have much of a ground wave but the
skip is beautiful we might transmit right over their heads
without them picking up a word

  perry said no make a signal to the others laying out
the new course forty knots give me an estimate of con-
tact between our forces presuming your reckoning to be
accurate

  yes sir

  tell the men to secure riggs

  yes sir riggs was gone

  the quartermaster no longer looked cold and bored nor
were there weary lines under his eyes the droplet was
gone from the end of his nose

  he watched the card and the lubber line with a hawk-like
intensity and he held the course so finely that his correc-
tions were scarcely visible for he had to move the helm
only a fraction at forty-six miles per hour to make the sleek
and roaring mosquito respond

  when riggs finished his final plotting he had good news
we couldnt possibly take more thantwo hours captain
at our present speed

  captain perry ruminated dully id like to signal dutch
harbor riggs the enemy might be in the zone of silence
and we might bounce out signals over them off the heavi-
side layer

  but we might not i cant afford to take the chance
itll be our show until we qso the enemy

they were spotted an hour later before the fog closed
- down the mists were rolling northward and visibility
had been growing poorer all the time

  the three motor torpedo boats were maintaining forty
knots streaking along at the front of a fine white wake dis-
placing so little water that there was scarcely a stern wave

  the boats ran clear and as the wind hauled around to
the north and began to flatten the swells of previous mak-
ing the going became much easier

  the lookout called aircraft approaching i

  captain perry and riggs grabbed their glasses and went
topside where away

  bearing zero four five sir

  there were four of them and although they were far
off and flying very high the skipper saw nothing familiar
in them he gve the alarm battle stations

  the deck of the mtb was quickly cleared not a living
soul outside the hatches closed tightly the armor shields
went up over the rear ports the forward shields were
screwed lock leaving the glass slots for navigation

  the skipper thought of his four torpedoes and what
might happen if a stray bullet hit one of the warheads
how did they put it in the books a surface ship carrying
torpedoes in tubes presumes and accepts the danger of a
chance hit in one of the warheads

  that was all right in a book there wouldnt be a splin-
ter of pt  left if a torpedo-or their depth charge-
detonated on deck one meant all there wouldnt be a

fragment left of them perry was keenly aware of that

   attack bombers said mr riggs watching them
through his glasses two place jobs demolitions packed
under the wings theyre not very fast

    captain perry told the engineroom watch to stand by
dont mind bombs so much he snapped afraid they
can machine-gun us easily though those tin fish-

    the roar of the fifty-caliber machine guns astern inter-
rupted him the range was closing he could feel a
tremor in the craft as the guns fired and in a moment he
could see the thin line of the tracers four pathways into the
sky he was remotely pleased to find their bearing good

the planes rolled away from the line of fire and split ijp
in another second there were only two of them

riggs snapped two for us captain here they come

fifty knots captain perry said full right rudder

ill

wake ho i

                                               

the mosquito boat surged forward momentarily and
then leaned on her side at the slots riggs breathed
in admiration at the skippers timing for the planes were
very low now and you could see the bombs drop

they struck ahead a hundred yards ahead exploding
the sea all around was spanked with white geysers from
the splinters

pt  continued her hard starboard turn

hold her on captain perry said crisply

some one in the stern had got the range they couldnt
tell which turret but twin tracer lines had found the
wing of the first plane and was holding on it sporadically
riggs held his breath hoping for the lucky bullet that
would touch off one of those small bombs

there was no such bullet the plane rolled away from
the line of fire and riggs lost sight of it with a muffled
curse

the mosquito boat was still hard in her turn while the
second plane banked to follow over her captain perry
straightened her out at full speed and suddenly watching
through the roof slots as the bomber roared after them he
called the engineroom five knots

the craft lost her weigh in three to four seconds she
dropped from fifty to five knots slicing sea up all around
them water poured over the bow as her head dropped
and doused the bridge they set the storm windows spin-
ning

reverse the screws took hold and the whole boat
shook -badly perry said itll pull her guts out but ive
got to do it

it didnt pull her guts out she took it the plane
overshot and its bombs showed the sea over five hundred
yards ahead leaving them on the rim of splinter splashes

ahead fifty knots

pt  raised her bow again and began to pound the
skipper suddenly liked the pounding he liked this grit-
ting of the teeth and tightening of the muscles there was
armament in the speed that made such pounding

riggs said theres the first one captain its in
trouble

rphe first bomber was smoking at the engine and there
were some tatters in the port wing the machine guns
astern both found her this time
launch torpedoes



   the plane had losther speed the four tracer lines ate
into her and she dove without warning a vertical dive
straight down on the nose

   riggs gasped when she hit there was nothing left of
her on the surface

   captain perry said hell go forty feet before the sea
slows him up    whats this bombs all gone

   the second attacker had wheeled in a broad circle gain-
ing altitude the plane was trying to get on the tail of
the mtb

   easier to attack from the bow said captain perry
quietly but if he feels that way about it we might as
well worry him

  he ordered a hard turn to port they followed the
circle of the plane obviously the plane was faster and
gained in the bank but the machine guns were chattering
and getting dangerously close to the mark

   the plane suddenly zoomed off to the other quadrant in
a climbing turn and gained more altitude it became
difficult to follow

   here he comes riggs said

   head into him said the skipper watch his bullet
splashes

   they headed into the line of flight of the attack bomber
and the sea before them became alive with spouts cap-
tain perry waited as long as he dared three hundred feet
and then zig-zagged the mtb off to starboard straightened
the course then another zig-zag to starboard

   the path of the bullets curved toward them but missed
completely the plane roared overhead thunderously very
close to them its engine whistling like a falling bomb
the fifty-calibers were rattling again they drew a bead
above the plane as he drew away going up

   the skipper distinctly saw the ship pass through the
hail of lead but nothing happened at two thousand feet
three of the four enemy aircraft met and then headed
northeast one trailing smoke

   riggs crossed his fingers and hoped the smoker wouldnt
make it captain perry said secure he went to the
radio shack and told stark to call in the other boats

   stark said pt  reports all well sir pt  has a
casualty bomb fell close splinter got the port machine
gunner in his turret not badly

   resume patrol bearing zero four five true captain
perry said is pt  seaworthy

   completely sir

   the skipper was pleased his eyes showed it his face
stayed gaunt call npr and send this report he said
he went out

t iggs was still sighting on the horizon with his glasses

     id swear he said that smoker went down but
the fog is getting too thick to see old man fog he just
keeps rolling along its bad enough to have a fight on
your hands with good visibility without-

   youll thank uncle joe for this fog later captain
perry said any casualties

   no sir and that was hamlin got the first bomber
that was excellent gunnery considering the motion
of this boat said captain perry

   the fog advection type was thick and growing dense
there was scarcely a visibility of seven hundred feet the
danger of collision with some other ship on the same course
southwest was remote of course and yet there was the slim
chance that they might somehow charge into an enemy

rear guard patrol if they did they did perry thought

   seven hundred feet of visibility at fifty knots was no
margin at all the two lookouts on the flying bridge swal-
lowed their discomfort and watched dead ahead with bulg-
ing eyes

   but with the moderating wind still working against the
morning swell the sea began to drop the pounding lessened
and they made a cleaner entry into each crest as they
caught up it and passed it

   astern the triple screws were throwing an arc of white
suds which reached fifteen feet high at the apex

   as the fog worsened closing in steadily around them
pt  and pt  jockeyed their positions closer to pt
 maintaining the same echelon formation but tightening
the distance between themselves in order to remain visible
to each other	s

   at four hundred feet the density reached a level and
stayed there

captain perry was surprised to find higgins come
up to the bridge from the radio shack dressed re-
spectably in a fatigue uniform bearing a message from
stark the radio man

   the skipper said this is reciprocation par excellence
higgins you dont have to work your passage on this
boat being shot down is enough work for one day

   he smiled faintly liking the lieutenant i only asked
you to stand by in case stark became a casualty wed
need a man at the key

   oh well captain higgins replied i dont mind help-
ing doing something keeps me from feeling queazier
you get quite a motion aboard here quite different from
a plane id rather feel im occupied if its okay with you
sir it helps me to hold my own

   seasick perry said

   not exactly but the pounding hit my stomach radio
message from npr captain stark is holding the direction
finder hoping for a radio bearing on the enemy fleet
tell him to keep trying perry said but they wont
give him any signal they know were around some place
he retired to his cabin with his code book and deciphered
the npr intelligence which read attack enemy on sight
that was that sort of redundant though he hadnt
planned to do anything else

   if he could break up a fleet train even with the threat
of a torpedo attack he would delay them just that much
longer and allow dutch harbor to prepare whatever de-
fensive measures were to be employed

   this was basic strategy this was his job the rest
belonged to secnav cincus and the army

   mr riggs reported at the cabin just as the skipper was
leaving two minutes from contact position with the
enemy captain he said no sign of ships no sound of
planes 

   captain perry said they wont have planes off the
carriers in pea soup riggs use your head they couldnt
get back again

   yes sir riggs said sober-faced

   if theres no contact at the pre-selected position said
the skipper change course right rudder bearing zero nine
zero true inform the other ships

   aye aye sir riggs snapped and ran for the radio
shack

   there was no contact captain perry concealed his in-
tense disappointment by looking completely blank
	argosy

 

 he knew riggs was watching him for some sign of im-
 patience perhaps riggs was worrying about a calldown on
 imperfect plotting but that was silly

 the three mosquitoes cantecj to starboard and executed
 a hard forty-five-degree turn straightening out on the
 track due east

 nobody said anything the quartermasters glassy eyes
 were riveted on the compass in its binnacle captain perry
 waited watching the movement of the ocean surface ahead
 of them

 riggs said radio beacon stations have closed down at
 scotch cap and st pauls he rolled his eyes theyll
 get a hot reception whether we find them or not

 i hope youre right captain perry said

 five minutes more captain perry began to get dis-
 couraged he signaled the other two boats to come up into
 horizontal line of formation four hundred feet on either
 side they did so cutting their weigh at top speed as pt
  slackened to let them gain the line

 another five minutes passed in dead silence

 the skipper finally sighed afraid weve missed them
 in this fog he turned to riggs thats ironic isnt it
 fog was our one real chance to get something done per-
 fect cover no need for smoke screen no fear of aircraft
 attack all perfect and then we lose them

 but he was wrong the lookout above on the flying
 bridge suddenly bellowed wake ho

iv

destroyer

captain perry scurried through the hatch up onto
the flying bridge with the agility of a jackrabbit

 riggs impressed as he was with the cry had to smile at
 the skipper perry looked a little ridiculous for a moment
 but once topside there was nothing ridiculous about him

 he saw the wake where the lookout called it on a bearing
 one zero one off the starboard bow first there was the
 telltale line of suds straight as a ruler beyond it a glassy
 flatness on the sea

 captain perry raised his binoculars found the other line
 of suds like a parallel rule they were with smooth sea
 between them

 the skipper turned to the lookout he said mildly not
 having had time to say it before for petes sake miller
 dont yell like that again with four hundred visibility
 we may be under their stern

 sorry sir miller said sober-faced

 riggs had come up i see its real captain

 captain perry nodded broad wake riggs  broad
 enough for the beam of a capital ship too broad for a
 transport but what would a battleship be lolling in the
 rear for i ask you

 make a signal to the others hold course watch for
 wakes thirty knots communicate by blinker tube battle
 stations

 aye aye sir

 the engines throttled down they were much more
 quiet the mosquito boat edged up along the line of the
 wake

 right rudder two degrees said captain perry hold
 her on come left to course zero nine zero again riggs
 all tubes ready for firing make a signal twenty-five knots

 the bow was down in the sea now the planning dead

 pt  having become a displacement boat at the slow pace

    twenty-two knots captain perry said quietly watch-
 ing the sea ahead with his binoculars

    the glassy area between the thickening suds was be-
 ginning to take on life ahead of them were glossy whirl-
 pools edged with foam the sud lines were converging
 the fog hung all around like fine snow

    they edged forward he couldnt hear the engines where
 he stood off on either beam the other mtbs were down
 to the same pace and a trifle astern riggs could hear the
 beating of his own heart in the silence

    enemy sighted sir the lookout snapped suddenly

    i know i know said captain perry his glasses were
 dead ahead ive seen her for the last ten seconds eighteen
 knots hold her on make a signal to the others

    there shes gone again twenty knots i make her
 speed

    check riggs said twenty

 tthey were dead in the center of the wake now twenty-
 five knots said captain perry the boat leaped for-
 ward once more and the swirls in the wake returned

 in another moment through the heavy fog they all saw
 a bulk big and gray and ominous in the swirling mists

 twenty knots captain perry held his glasses on her
 stern as his speed dropped to match the speed of the enemy
 ship he took one long look ten knots right rudder
 bearing two seven zero

 they wheeled away from the course crossed the sud line
 of the wake and went back where they found pt  and
 pt  lolling on the sea

 by blinker captain perry told them to form behind
 him at five knots they fell in

 riggs said what was it captain

 shes the kaga said captain perry aircraft carrier
 twenty-nine thousand tons originally laid down as a battle-
 ship that accounts for the broad wake she has a broad
 beam

 when they found the wake again captain perry said
 two knots cant torpedo tubes one and two ready for
 firing

 aye aye sir

 this is our lucky day riggs we got a look at her
 without being seen her stern is loaded with four point
 sevens that can be brought to bear on the surface besides
 playing at aa stand by

 when they were dead in the center of the wake the
 skipper said collision course bearing zero nine zero
 fire number one fire number two stark

 yes sir

 make the signal left rudder bearing zero one zero
 fifty knots

 it had happened with such brevity and dispatch that it
 was hard to believe that they had attacked but the whiff
 of the cordite fumes was in the air and off the port and
 starboard the two glistening torpedos had flashed into the
 sea

 riggs wathed the port one as it ran for twenty feet
 or so in a northeasterly direction leaving a white streak
 of roiled sea where it had passed

 the air lever had functioned perfectly and as riggs
 watched he saw that the gyroscope was functioning per-
 fectly too set at an angle to the torpedos axis it brought
 the torpedo around on a straight course in the wake twen-
 ty-five feet or so off dead center
launch torpedoes



 the torpedoes both disappeared

 pt  had come about to port and was racing thunder-
 ously across the sea kicking up her spray-tail at full speed
 with pt  and pt  in her wake each in turn drenched
 the ship behind it except pt 

 they crossed the sud line going like the wind and they
 were rapidly far off the torpedo track and to the northward

 since their speeds exceeded the speed of the torpedoes
 they managed to lengthen the distance of proximity with
 the enemy a good deal but hardly enough

 sphere were two explosions at first dull like a jar
 and then tremendous the detonation deafening the
 concussion striking down the lookout on the flying bridge
 of pt 

 too close to their own tin fish captain perry gripped a
 handrail and watched astern

 pt  cut out of line for a moment then swung back and
 began to drop behind-them her blinker tube sent port
 engine failure due to concussion

 pt  sent back make emergency repairs under weigh
 what is the best you can do on two engines

 thirty knots top

 do it then right rudder bearing zero nine zero thirty
 knots  we are going into enemy fleet avoid destroyers
 and cruisers center attack on transports and capital ships
 dont fire until you see the whites of their plimsolls

   the signal man smiled grimly at the command and
 glanced at his skipper but captain perry did not smile

   mr riggs came up his eyes were shining two hits
 sir

   two hits said captain perry wish we could see
 her thatll put her out of the action they went in by the
 screws or theyd have missed altogether

   but we cant count on having sunk her if she drops
 her tail enough to keep the planes on her decks and spoil
 takeoffs thats all i ask

   all eyes peeled for the train we should be coming
 up on it

   pt s blinker tube was working again the signal
 man reported pt  reports port engine functioning

    fifty knots perry said here we go

    destroyer dead ahead sir   the lookout shrilled

    hell said riggs

v

battleship i

 there she was coming like a gray ghost out of the sea
 she was terribly big with a tremenduous sheer for-
 ward and she looked as piled up as a skyscraper to them

    she was dead on them in a collision course as she boiled
 out of theast at thirty-four knots

    she had two five point ones mounted in the forward tur-
 ret and the instant she sighted them she fired a salvo
 the shells burst so far astern they couldnt even see the
 geysers in the fog

    hibiki type said captain perry tersely looks like
 the ikaduti but i cant be certain she cant bring those
 forward guns to bear on us at this range shell try and
 ram us they must have sent her back to look for us

   the distance between them was ridiculous machine
 guns were firing from the destroyer and the bullet spouts
 were kicking up the sea all around them

  pt  made the signal break formation pass to port
of her full speed and go in at transports

  the trailing mosquito boats broke away to port and in-
stantly disappeared in the fog the ikaduti was two hun-
dred feet dead ahead of the mosquito boat now the sea
furious at her cutwater machine guns had found the range
for there were wood splinters flying forward

  captain perry said stand by the can release can
hold the course right full rudder left rudder bearing
zero nine zero

  riggs heart was in his mouth astern they had dropped
their sole anti-submarine depth charge into the sea

  at fifty feet distance from the huge bow of the ikaduti
the mosquito boat canted hard over she swung off at
ninety degrees and then swung back on the eastern track
again

  this put her a bare twenty feet or so on the portside of
the destroyer as it swept by too slow for all its thirty-four
knots to make any sueh maneuver

  they broke into the big ships bow wave and stern wave
then and there was hell to pay the pounding was terrific
as they went across the swells slamming down so hard that
riggs prayed for the seams there was sea on them in
the air and all around them but pt  did not capsize

  they could still see the destroyer faintly astern as the
fog began to close around her she was beginning a hard
turn then the depth charge detonated

  it caught her on the port bow as she nosed and ca-
reened her far over in another instant pt s tremen-
duous speed had carried her beyond the visibility range
and they could see no more of ikaduti

  but captain perry said if that didnt hole her nothing
ever will

  in the fog there was the scream of a salvo ahead of
them three shells burst in the sea directly on their track
the splinters spanked the sea white all around

  at captain perrys side the lookout collapsed limply
riggs couldnt even see a wound on the man but he could
see that miller was dead

  the signal man shouted destroyer abeam the fog
is breaking

she was off to the north on a western track-sent back
no doubt to find them-and she had spotted them
through a broad sudden gap in the fog

  captain perry examined her with his glasses well
catch it he snapped she was slowing her speed and com-
ing over toward them and her forward aft and beam tur-
rets were being brought to bear

  right rudder course one one zero

  they wheeled into the safety of the fog slapping hard
with seas on the port quarter behind them the guns
roared ahead of them a salvo straddled the track they
would pass on

  riggs cried that shooting is too good it must be
lucky

  off to the south there was a dull jar and explosion and
the rattle of machine gun fire then another jar and
finally a third

  captain perry looked grimly pleased those were tor-
pedoes finding a target three hits he hoped they were
on three different ships

  right rudder bearing one five five he said making
for the sound of the explosions overhead a trio of shells
screamed by and burst close off the port bow they were


argosy

out of sight in the fog then and the destroyer would be
shooting blind

  perry promptly forgot her he could run away from
her with ease

  somewhere east there was a ghastly explosion

  mr riggs plot our position and radio npr the ap-
proximate location of the enemy we cant do any more
when the torpedoes give out and we might lose them in
the mists

  aye aye sir

  so riggs did not see the transport they broke into vis-
ibility range without warning and the sight was appalling

  off the starboard bow a ship was sinking badly she
was heeled far over on her port and the sea around her was
alive with struggling men

  perry said left rudder come to bearing zero nine zero
pt  wheeled to port and followed parallel to the enemy
track the transport passed astern in the fog

rthe signal man said pt  dead ahead sir and
captain perry glowed it was marvelous luck making
a contact with his command again in all the fog and con-
fusion

  but he saw no sign of pt  and to his dismay he
realized that the fog was thinning and visibility was grow-
ing greater all the time advection fog blowing with the
wind	

  oh well theyd been riding their luck terrifically and
you had to get a bad break some place you just couldnt
walk off with the honors of an engagement without engag-
ing the enemy really

  there they were to starboard three hundred yards
ahead-with visibility now around five hundred yards-he
saw two more transports sinking they were getting boats
over one was capsizing there was no sign of pt 

  captain perry took up the command on the interior
bridge they bolted the aft hatch of the lower bridge se-
curely there was good reason for this

  off the port bow in battle line were three heavy cruisers
the kako class his binoculars told him seven thousand
tons mounting six eight-inchers each not to mention the
lighter four-point-sevens

  the range was just under fifteen hundred feet almost
point blank on the decks of the cruisers there were
flashes and instantly the scream of shells

  the explosions were close and violent from the eye
slots of the bridge they could see the concussion lift pt
s stern out of the sea but it dropped back again whole
and pt  continued her track

  the skipper said tell pt  to take the first transport
well take the second then both come right to course zero
three six across the transports bows and take cover on their
starboard from the cruisers fire

  forward there was a blinding flash that graceful
sheer with the raked stem vanished as if it had been
smashed by a ragged fist the flame was brilliant

  the starboard side of the bridge house was sheered
brokenly captain perry was thrown on his back he
thought good lord not the torpedoes but when he
rose to his feet with blood on his left hand pt  still
held her weigh and the stern was intact

  there was no longer a bow it was gone the forepeak
smashed in completely but there was enough freeboard
forward for navigation

  the quartermaster was dead on the floor the signal man

was smashed under the starboard porthole shield riggs
got to his feet there wasnt a mark on him he said
youre wounded dick

aptain perry looked at his hand there was an
 expression of astonishment on his face not at the
wound he had felt the splinter bite in and he had seen
the blood he was astonished at riggs calling him by his
given name riggs had never called him dick before in
his life

  im all right perry said it doesnt hurt and the
hand works did pt  make it

  shes still ahead of us riggs said that was a di-
rect hit its a wonder-

  not an eight-incher said the skipper we wouldnt
be here it was a four point seven the hell with it
were still moving couldnt have holed us

  theres our target ill give her twenty knots col-
lision course one three three bearing right rudder tube
number three stand by thirty knots

  they worked in with their ragged forepeak and bow on
the transports port quarter the ship being ahead of them
slightly captain perry said launch number three
the torpedo grunted out of the number three tube on the
portside ran off at an angle changed its course and headed
fyr the target perry said right rudder to course one
six two fifty knots

  they shot toward the southeast behind the stern of the
transport fa behind it seemed ridiculous that the boat
could still move at such speed with the shattered forepeak

  but the hull up forward was still sound and with the
lessened weight of the three discharged torpedoes pt 
had picked up a few knots over her rated top

  through his glasses the skipper saw that pt  had
dodged ahead of her target without firing a warhead and
the reason was obvious the cruisers had laid down a wall
of steel systematically across the track that the mtb would
have had to follow to go in for the shot

  pt  was five hundred yards to starboard of the trans-
port-she was the twin screw m s chichibu maru of
seventeen thousand tons-when her torpedo struck

  captain perry and riggs and lieutenant higgins who
had joined them on the bridge saw the spire of white
water rise a hundred feet into the air before they heard
the detonation

  they did not feel much of the concussion being shielded
by the victim

  far ahead was pt  racing away from the leading
transport captain perry ordered a course due south he
had an idea that pt  had launched a torpedo at the
lead transport

  if they had kept on their course they might have arrived
in time for the hit which would have been disastrous

  he was right they saw the flash heard the roar
watched the sea spurt skyward saw the transport lean
heavily to port and hang there

and then southward straddling pt  beautifully a
salvo of big shells the explosions were terrific
battleship riggs cried those are fourteen-inchers
captain perry said the fogs gone south were in
the open from now on the visibility has opened up the
range

  bearing one eight zero riggs the time has come to
run away and fight again some other day if they letus
some show said higgins
launch torpedoes



 hphe enemy had no intention of letting them slip south-
 ward into the rolling fog there and take cover behind

 it

 behind the fleet track the destroyers were to be seen
 which accounted for the geysers of sea around them and
 the thudding of great steel splinters into the hull

 eastward six hundred yards to starboard of the trans-
 ports and the battleships a heavy cruiser had opened fire
 on them

 three other cruisers were laying shells around pt 
 who beat to southward at top speed zigzagging as crazily
 as she could heading for each last shell burst and trying
 to throw off the enemy plotting

 perry suddenly came out of the weary daze he had been
 in for the last moment right rudder full he snapped
 bearing zero zero zero

 pt  slung around madly pounding into her own wake

 the skipper said stand by number four tube

 pt  put her bow on a collision course with the bow of
 the transport which pt  had had to skip by fire num-
 ber four

 and when the torpedo was on its bubbling white way
 left rudder full course one eight zero and they were
 south again

    perry was gripping a handrail and his face was very pale
 riggs looked worried about him perry said forgot that
 last one we couldnt go back with a warhead in the tube
 could we riggs

no sir riggs said im afraid its a miss captain

    too long a track shes turning away from it

 the fog bank seemed a long way off they ran for it
 dodging back and forth like a waterbug whipping
 west then east and always back to the southern track

    pt  was going to make it they could see her already
 reaching the mists	

 out behind them there was a whistle then a whine
 then a scream they dropped to the floor of the bridge

    it was not a direct hit the eight-inch shell burst di-
 rectly abaft the stern but the splinters shredded the
 transom like firewood

    two engines went out and the third vibrated alarmingly
 their speed fell to a mere ten knots captain perry couldnt
 raise the engineer

    riggs went astern reported back that adams was dead
 and so was luce and mckay was badly wounded hig-
 gins returned to render first aid

   pt  staggered on toward the fog bank way back a
 destroyer was finally laying a smoke screen to starboard of
 the fleet train but before the smoke covered the train
 captain perry could see it five transports going one far
 down in the stern and sliding

west the aircraft carrier kaga had completely vanished

    the skipper looked at his watch the action had taken
 thirty minutes it was hard to believe

    a shell exploded a hundred yards off their starboard
 there was something desultory about its burst

   riggs came back captain perry said were sinking
 tell stark to signal pt 

   that was unnecessary pt  had seen the holes in
 pt s stern and bow only watertight compartments
 prevented her sinking quickly water was pouring in
 through the gaps at the chine forward now that the bow
 had dropped with the slow speed

pt  came back from the protection of the fog bank

and took them off captain perry really saw his own boat
for the first time when he set foot in the bridge of pt 

  he was appalled there wasnt enough left of her really
to float he wondered how he and riggs and stark hig-
gins the signalman and the torpedoman mckay had
managed to live through it

  he saluted the colors smartly with his good hand and
shook hands with lieutenant-commander sanford pt s
skipper and looked as if he would faint riggs supported
him

  captain perry said good work captain you got one
in on the leading ship what happened to pt 
sanford said she struck the third transport with two
missed one that was her torpedo then she was hit
do you have any torpedoes left

  i havent anything left but enough gasoline to get us to
kiska island if we use one engine said captain sanford
they had reached the fog bank at last as if in parting a
salvo of three shells roared in the sky and burst behind
them in the sea all far short for she was at top speed

  pt  rolled badly back there filled with sea and settling
rapidly there was another whine in the sky a burst and
pt  was no longer visible in the mountain of white water
which rose settled leaving the sea empty

  some one said well here comes the army

captain perry reeled it wasnt the arm he had
a wound in his side and that was the one which hurt
he could feel it wasnt mortal but his clothes were wet
with blood and he felt dizzy

  but everything was explained now whythe enemy had
not followed them shelled them to pieces there were
more important things in view for them

  off to the north where the enemy train lay he could hear
a terrific racket it was quite a show every anti-aircraft
gun in the fleet had opened up

  he struggled to his feet not realizing he had sat down
what is it he said what is it riggs

  i guess riggs replied higgins got through to npr
with his radio signals even if they did jam his frequency
those are boeing yb-lss captain flying fortresses i
lost count of them at fifty-three but there are more

  i talked with one of the guys who flies a thing like
that when i was back in seattle last winter and he was
willing to bet me a months pay that he could put one out
of three bombs down the funnel of the queen elizabeth
from twenty thousand feet on any kind of day

  i hope his sperry and his aim are as good as his brag-
ging today sir take it easy there

  the dull jars came across the horizon as the fog hid the
enemy finally from view each jar shook them a little
it was a fine feeling it made captain perry think of the
jar when his torpedoes had gone in and found the mark

  those were hits he hoped the big bombers would
have nothing but ack-ack to stay clear of and they could
hang up above the muck with the bombsight pt  had
seen to it there would be no fighters to rise up

  pt  had seen to a lot of things

  perry was thinking this and feeling proud of the slim
eighty-one foot hull which carried him theyre ships
he whispered ships

  aye aye sir riggs grinned he stood there a little
embarrassed for it was obvious the skipper did not know
they had put him to bed that he was out on his feet and
that the words had hardly been conscious ones

here in the jewel marts of paris and in a new
world laboratory together is the zenith of the
mystery the darkness and the beauty at the
heart of a precious thing here is the secret
shadow over a lustrous woman a black pearl

shipman coming down to work in the morning
paused before turning in at the door of his gem
laboratory he went to the window and stared in
open astonishment at the single object there displayed

  a snowy pedestal came to a point on this point and
backed by a dead white reflector was a tiny blade sphere
in front of it was mounted an enlarging glass

  looking through the glass shipman stared anew at
what might have been the finest black pearl he had ever
looked upon and he had seen the pick of the worlds
jewels



  his critical eye instantly described what few other eyes
would have noted there was something wrong with this
black pearl but to average sight it was a lustrous glow-
ing sphere of deep gray ricre a rich black in direct light
darkly shimmering with a marvelous soft glory a thing of
living beauty and mystery

  he was angry as he turned into the office he wanted no
display in the window above all he wanted nothing dis-
played that was imperfect as he sensed something about
this black pearl to be imperfect

  his laboratory served the jewel trade all over the coun-
try it dealt with cutting testing -setting and otherwise
treating precious stones it was an educational institution
not a showoff place it had nothing to sell except knowl-
edge and the most modern scientific treatment of gems

  who the devil put that thing in the window shipman
barked as he strode in

  my doing chief korvo his dark and competent as-
sistant stepped forward

the perilous

lorin hit between the eyes fell forward into hia
chair senseless michael quickly and surely
retrieved his pearl

pearl
the perilous pearl



  oh then suppose you come in and tell me about it
in his private office shipman settled down behind the
desk fiddled with his pipe and then abandoned it for a
cigar korvo pulled up a chair this lean rather sinister-
looking man of european birth was an authority on gems
a world-famed expert

  he was also conversant with shipmans private wor-
ries of the moment

  that young lady marie wilson he said cheerfully
will see the pearl in the window you know that she
hangs about this place fascinated by it

   now chief youve recovered the stones that she certain-
ly stole you know shes supposed to be a bit off her head
she very probably does not know her own name

  ua jewel maniac theyd callher i know better i know
shes possessed of an elemental spirit or to go back to the
greek terminology a demon

   i still say thats damned nonsense all of it exclaimed
shipman vigorously

  would you accept the police theory-

   blast it no shes the finest-person alive

  certainly once shes herself youre fascinated by
her anyone would be you refuse to believe in demons
you refuse to believe shes a thief in short you know
perfectly well that my theory is mercifully just to her and
is correct but you refuse to admit it

  at least youve agreed that i shall handle her when
next she shows up

  yes damn it shipman growled korvo smiled widely
good do you recall the legend of homer that true
dreams came through gates of horn and false dreams
through gates of ivory

  in the odyssey isnt it said shipman whats that
got to do with it

  oh everything korvo waved his hand horn was
a substance associated with the moon in greek eyes the
moon was the queen of sleep hence true dreams came
through gates of horn

  but ivory is a purely animal substance hence false
dreams came through gates of ivory

  shipman glowered korvo hurried on

 a pply this to our jewel-loving demon who has taken
possession of marie wilson he has a passion for
certain curious gems this black pearl will attract him
now with the proper exorcisms im confident that i can
drive the demon out of her and into this pearl

  shipman had the sickening feeling that his assistant had
gone off the deep end korvo might have a private belief in
devils that was all right millions of other people did but
to talk about them in this matter-of-fact way-well it
was just not normal

  what in heavens name has all this farrago about ivory
gates got to do with the thing in hand shipman broke-
out impatiently

  im coming to that chief of herself this girl marie
wilson knows nothing about gems this spirit or demon
who is in her knows a lot about them he drives her to
steal them and later hell drive her to murder for them

  its by his influence that she has induced the remark-
able visions to call them so which weve seen when a jewel
is placed into your examining machine this is something
weve all seen and know to be real it should make you
credit my theory-

  damn your devil theory- said shipman rather help-

lessly i dont know what to believe about the whole
thing-except that this woman is the loveliest creature on
earth and in need of help

  granted chief korvo went on cheerfully but sup-
pose shes possessed by an elemental spirit dont talk of
devils use the correct expressions now what sort of
stone would offer a refuge and habitation to this spirit
who has a passionate love for jewels none because of
their molecular composition or at least very few stones
shipman grunted you and your casting out of devils

i think youre nuts

  never mind what about a pearl and especially a
black pearl what is it not a stone like other gems but
a bit of animal substance the same as ivory is you get
the idea

  no shipman replied curtly

  well this elemental spirit is essentially evil as we
know therefore he would be instantly attracted to this
black pearl which is symbolic of evil

  korvo produced a thin sheaf of typed papers i have
here various kinds of exorcisms from different sources
which i propose to use 

  this was too much shipman threw up his hands with
a groan

  korvo youre stark staring mad to talk of using
magic formulas in this day and age-good lord youre
just plain crazy

nothing of the sort chief protested korvo these
have been used in the past to cast out devils now lets be
sensible about it all if the thing has been done before-
get out of here broke in shipman his leanly chiseled
features working with anger get out

  oh all right korvo rose hurriedly but if she
comes you promised that i should deal with her and
ill want you to hide in the examination room and see what
happens

  hold onl tell me something spoke up shipman
that black pearl should be worth a lot of money whats
wrong with it

  his assistant grinned

  it belongs to me chief an heirloom from the old
country its one of those black pearls from sunda straits
at one time however it got badly hurt on one side the
nacre is cut and broken mve thought of skinning it but
decided to keep it just as it is speaks well for your eye
to tell anything was wrong

   well think the matter over chief

  with this he departed leaving shipman to his pipe and
the morning mail and a mood of helpless irritation and
despair

vork it was impossible his mind was full of her
and of her terrible situation he could only assign it
to dual personality a good self and a bad self this was
merely another way of reaching korvos conclusion but it
was more satisfactory to the practical shipman than talk of
elemental beings or devils

  from their first meeting she had been struggling with
herself seeking his help one moment fleeing from him the
next he knew she had been agonized by this struggle un-
able herself to comprehend it

  a mental case shipman knew better he knew she
must be helped saved cured or she was a lost woman her
mania for precious stones her obsession on the subject
had brought her to the laboratory in the first place and


argosy

the amazing experiences here induced had left shipman
dumbfounded

   he at least was no mental case he knew korvo knew
that her presence when a stone was being examined evoked
scenes episodes from the past whose past

   korvo believed it was from the past experiences ofthe
devil within her who had inhabited and possessed other
human beings

   absolute nonsense snorted shipman angrily damn
it i cant work and why would her very fingerprints re-
semble those of julie favre the jewel murderess who was
guillotined twenty years ago why unless-

  the interphone buzzed he threw the switch and an-
swered

   chief it was korvos voice tense with excitement
shes outside looking at the black pearl youve just time
to slip through and get into the examination room leave
it all to me

   right

   with one leap shipman was out from behind his desk
and at the door abruptly all his hesitation and indecision
was gone here was action and the testing of korvos
theory

   and if korvo were wrong he thought grimly he him-
self would take a more desperate hand in the game his
heart had failed him when he las tried it for he loved this
almost unknown girl

   he slipped into the little examination room which had a
shallow curtained recess this he occupied and drew the
black curtain that matched the black walls the room con-
tained only the intricate mechanism of the polyandroscope
and three chairs

  this machine which shipman had invented and de-
veloped could work miracles with any jewel but the
things he had seen it do in marie wilsons presence far
outshone his own miracles

   presently he heard korvos voice raised for his benefit
as the two approached

utte may be back this morning or he may not miss

   - wilson however ill be only too glad to place the
pearl in the machine as you request i must warn you- not
to expect the same result as with a precious stone this is
not a stone but layers of nacre further it is black and
not translucent i strongly doubt-

   if you tried black light that might work on it that
was the girls voice they were almost at the door of the
little room but i suppose theres no such thing

  by george cried korvo in genuine enthusiasm
thats an idea of course it exists moving picture tech-
nicians have achieved it long ago and i can almost get it
on the machine here

   come in come in well have a try at this idea of yours
what with infra rays and the polarized light beams-
ill have the prisms rearranged and well see make your-
self comfortable while i tinker a bit

   shipman sitting in his niche scoffed to himself at the
notion a pearl reflects light and under the quartz rays
the true may thus be told from the false biit he was ex-
tremely skeptical of any result whatever on the polyandro-
scope his own experiments in this direction had been
failures

   he forgot everything else as past one edge of the curtain
he looked at the girl she was not three feet from him
sight of her face startled him

  when she was last here she had been defiant hostile
inimical now she was herself again utterly lovely a
tenderness in her eyes he had seldom seen there

  i had hoped to find mr shipman she was saying as
korvo worked at the machine i owe him many apolo-
gies id have been here sooner but ive been down with a
touch of flu im afraid i wasnt very pleasant when i was
last here

  korvo said nothing until a moment later an exclama-
tion escaped him

  there upon my word i believe weve got something
he switched off the room lights steady now smoke if
you like it may take a bit of time

  shipman curious craned to see what happened the
machine with its huge glass sphere and silver reflector
overhead was lost in the darkness only the needle of light
appeared beneath the central clamp that held the pearl

  gradually he became conscious of a luminous darkness
growing within the sphere and returning from the reflector
it was the peculiar steely sheen such as a black pearl itself
exhibits under artificial light impossible to define in words
yet a distinct radiance

  and very slowly this cleared something became dimly
visible there an angular upright something like some
skeleton structure half-seen against a dark night sky

  after a moment shipman comprehended that this angu-
lar shape was a guillotine

   it was not i a girls voice a womans voice fluttered
and beat upon the room that of the girl in the chair no
she was vaguely visible unmoving tense absorbed in the
luminous grayness it was not i who did it i tell you it
was not i   

  the voice died out the angular shape faded away the
luminous darkness increased in the room objects became
visible in the glass sphere grew the enormously magnified
circle of the pearl itself shot through with a faintly shim-
mering effect of light

   then it lost all shape was disturbed was like water or
fog why it was fog sure enough

rphin steamy fog such as drifts in upon paris from the
 seine at rare intervals paris no doubt of it and the
seine

   here was a bridge astream with busses taxis cars half
visible through the fog a towering statue up above henri
iv of course

   this was the pont neuf in paris with the stalls of book-
sellers reaching away along the embankment and coming
up through the fog appeared the face of a boy staring
wildly at his companion

   a face dark and pinched keenly alive

  the face of korvo as a boy yes the same face the
same voice deeply rich eloquent appealing

  dont do it gregor he was saying pleading urgently
and desperately you know that it is the only thing we
have left and tatiana is counting upon it

  our precious sister isnt losing anything intervened
the older voice im not doing anything with it you fool
im merely showing the pearls to julie

  and im afraid of her said the boy

  his brother gregor burst into a laugh a good-looking
fellow in his way like many of the russian exiles who
crowded into paris in  reckless gay not too strong
a face not half so strong as that of the boy beside him he
patted the boy on the shoulder
the perilous pearl



   on your way and dont tell any tales  must get back
to the shop cant afford to lose that job

  he smiled look here come around to the shop at
six and ill take you up to julies place well have a
drink and a chat she can see what a fine chap you are and
well get back to join tatiana for dinner at eight agreed

 agreed gregor exclaimed the boy quickly and his 
face brightened the two parted gregor crossing toward
the city the boy michael plunging into the rabbit-warren
of the left bank with its twisting streets and firetrap tene-
ments

   plunging into one of these tenements the boy clattered
up the stairs and came into a little three-room apartment
instantly thought of the dingy exterior was swept away
here all was neat clean fresh with dainty touches every-
where

   a woman seated over her sewing looked up smiled
embraced him warmly she was not young not pretty this
older sister but there was something about her that made
one look twice with a catch of the breath

   artists of the quarter had used her calm face more than
once as a model for that of the madonna

  i met gregor exclaimed the boy im going back
and meet him when the shop closes

   yes his sister regarded him quietly i see that the
pearls are gone

   oh i hoped-i hoped you wouldnt find out he said
in dismay she smiled not happily

   dear michael now tell me all about jt did gregor
take them

   he nodded his dark thin features set in a scowl

   he swears hes only going to show them to julie hes
telling the truth but im going there with him to make
sure well be back by dinner time

   dont worry about gregor she said calmly even if
he is infatuated with this young woman he knows that the
pearls are all we have in the world hes not the owner we
all own them

   im not worried about gregor but about this woman
julie favre

  oh she changed countenance i suppose so ive
never seen her she has a good place as a model at chanels
-nonsense we can trust gregor implicity of course
think how he got us out of russia well what other
news

   none said the boy and went about his affairs

   when he set out for the shop it was growing dark and
the thin fog continued making the streets highly unsafe
he picked up gregor at the fashionable shop in the rue
st honore and together they crammed into a bus that took
them to the old quarter behind the bourse

   michael kept a sharp eye on those around that morocco
case in gregors breast pocket was a bulging temptation
to pickpockets

   julies apartment was nothing garish but it was far
better than average so was julie favre herself a cool
slim dark creature all fire and laughter she greeted
gregor with a kiss and michael with another and boy
though he was he noted that it was a kiss to set him on
his toes

   he could not blame his brother for being infatuated
this julie would have kindled a fire under the sphinx he
watched her wide-eyed yet curiously enough that kiss of
greeting had somehow set him against her

   gregor got out the fat morocco case and opened it and

argosy-march  

there were the pearls a necklace of them the shimmering
white ceylon pearls with three pendants each having one
enormous black pearl dangling

   not only were they worth a fortune they were extreme-
ly rare at any price and the three black pearls were
matched an almost unheard-of thing

  julie favre stared at them trembling she scarcely
spoke at all she just touched them and stared at them her
dark eyes all ablaze and her breath coming fast gregor
laughed heartily at her excitement and mentioned their
value she shrugged

   the value it is nothing mon ami it is the pearls
themselves one could actually love such gems love them
and to possess them no price would be too dear youre a
lucky man my gregor your sister is a lucky woman put
them away before they tempt me too far

   she sighed and-hid her eyes he laughing put them in
their case and pocketed it when she looked up again
michael caught the strange tense look in her face he
never forgot it

  that was all presently the two brothers went home
again in the fog

tvtext day the fog continued a strange and unusual
-l  thing for paris the streets were wet the sludge of the
metro stank in ones nostrils

   it was a thursday the weekly half-holiday like satur-
day in america

  michael who was out job-hunting did not come home
until late in the afternoon he was elated having run down
a position with a broker on the curb jewel market already
his knowledge of precious stones was remarkable

   he found police in the apartment and frightful tragedy
that promised to sear him for life his brother was dead
his sister was dying they had been stabbed to death by
someone who had rifled the place taking the pearls who

  not a woman but a devil this was the only thing
tatiana said as she died in her hand were gripped two
pearls from the necklace-a white gem and one of the
black pearls michael sold the white one later and kept
the black one

  the murderer there was no shadow of any clue two
russians in those days were of small importance to the
french police no one had been seen coming or going

   michael saw julie favre briefly at the funeral she
embraced him wept with him and went away leaving him
chilled and revolted why he could not say but he was
sensitive to falseness of any kind

   he did not like her very definitely in his bewildered
affliction however he had no earthly reason to suspect -her
-except that his sister had mentioned a woman and this
was no cause for suspecting such a woman as julie
gregors beloved

   michaels employer was a queer old fellow an armenian
who had been a millionaire before the war and who now
made a livelihood in the game of wits that was the curb
market for jewels

   it was a market consisting of cafes men loitering about
tables or along the street and som women also with
everything done in the open air or over a drink fortunes
changed hands daily-not only stones but also pearls for
paris was the pearl market of the world

  while these brokers who were of every race under
heaven not only dealt in illicit goods but would cheat one
another at the drop of a hat there was none the less a cer-


argosy

tain esprit de corps among them a kind of loyalty

    michaels story became known for was he not one of
  them now his black pearl was greatly admired on all
  sides but the old armenian kept him from selling it

    wait my son wait he would say wagging his fat
  jowl if that necklace is ever found where will it or its
  jewels be sold here where will search be made for pearls
  to replace those two broken away here

     so go slowly these men would cut our throats in any
  business deal but theyre all watching for some sign of that
  necklace they like you

tvtichael waited and applied himself to the work in
hand some day some day the words were burned
into his brain some day he would see that the murderer
came to justice this was the ambition that drove him day
and night the old armenian encouraged him in it

    but do not look for any person my son he would
  say me i am too old i know how many devils are in the
  world and how few angels the angels will help you in
  this search be sure of it however do not look for any
  person

    what do you mean by that eramian asked michael
  in his dark poised way

     who killed your brother and sister no person but a
  devil did she not say as much she was dying she told
  the truth her eyes saw clearly you have a feud with one
  of the elemental devils my son and it will endure while
  you live and after you die

    a knife in the hand of someone perhaps a woman
  killed those two but it was a devil inhabiting the womans
  body who really did the work

     michael learned a lot about devils from old eramian
  who knew all about them and a little about angels and
  as the weeks dragged into months he learned a tremendous
  lot about precious stones which he could never have picked
  up elsewhere

     here on the jewel curb were the best of all forgeries
  imitations stolen stones and gems whose owners did not
  want to sell publicly

     michael learned why zircons display absorption-bands
  of the spectrum for what purpose diamonds are floated in
  methylene iodide and the ridiculously simple means of dis-
  tinguishing a real ruby from an imitation that passes all
  the standard tests these and everything in between

    and then one day in late spring came the clue

aff and on during these months jewel robberies had oc-
 curred and with them three murders by stabbing
the police began to recognize that a jewel maniac as
they termed the murderer was at work someone who
 murdered when robbery might have served better

     old eramian had said as much all along

     these elemental spirits he would say are terrible
  creatures our wise men our ancient priests knew them
  well and conquered them they murder for the sake of mur-
  dering and the average human mind cannot combat them
  or understand them they have a particular mania for
  jewels as is well known 

    then what is the use of my finding who murdered
  gregor and tatiana

     little said the old man get that person guillotined
   however and the devil must go find another home which
   may take a long time your feud is not with the person it
   is with the elemental the spirit whom we call a devil

   thus michael absorbed more or less belief in the active
existence of evil spirits a belief not in harmony with the
workaday world yet none the less rooted in primitive
humanity

   not that it worried him particularly he was intent upon
bringing the murderer to justice in simpler terms

   one afternoon he went to the hotel druout where all
the paris auctions take place to examine some jewels that
were to be sold on the morrow the huge bare rooms of this
former palace teemed with second-hand dealers amateurs
scholars collectors of all kinds

   michael was turning away from the showcases of jewels
when a levantine whom he knew to be a pearl expert of
the curb market beckoned to him they stepped aside

   i might seek to buy that black pearl of yours said the
levantine but i prefer to tell you where you may sell it
-to match others

   michael felt a sudden tingling something definite at last
the levantine handed him a greasy card bearing the name
and address of one francois lorin

   he sought me out yesterday he is trying to find a
dark gray or black pearl of about twenty grains he has
two and seeks to match them with a third whether it
will interest you or not i cannot say

   michael said nothing to theold armenian but that eve-
ning he took the metro out to the former suburb of passy
and sought lorins address

   he knew that lorin was acting for someone else and he
also knew that lorin would not talk even to the police

   but driven by that deadly ambition which had stamped
into his boyish features an almost sinister air he had de-
 termined that lorin would talk fully and would do it now

t orins apartment near the avenue mozart was not
 pretentious it served in french fashion both as office
and as dwelling lorin was a business negotiator the term
covering anything from brokerage to commission business

   michael gathered all this while he stood at the door
talking not until he displayed a glimpse of the black
pearl nested in a little box did lorin admit him then
eyes bulging and whiskers bristling with excitement lorin
hastily banished a half-visible family and ushered the vis-
itor into his office

  this was a commodious room near the entry heavy
with books and desk and untidy papers an open safe in
one corner when the door was closed the wqrld was shut
out very solidly

   lorin finding himself dealing with a young fellow no
more than a boy assumed his most ferocious and domineer-
ing manner michael readily let him examine the pearl
which he did minutely meantime the alert gaze of
michael was roving about the room the desk everywhere

   lorin looked up and grunted well well poor lustre
a poor pearl but ill take a chance your price

   not for sale to you said michael send me to your
client ill do the selling you shall have ten percent of
the price

   the room resounded to blustering to roaring oaths to
all the extravagances of gallic business play michael
stood pat saying little he finally raised the percentage
but by this time lorin was really furious

   very well the agents fat hairy hand closed on the
little box youve stolen this pearl you gamin i shall
keep it and communicate with the police off with you
clear out before i call for an agent
the perilous pearl



  the old trick was perfectly safe if michael called the
police lorin was a virtuous business man if not then
lorin had the pearl for nothing but michael only looked
hard at him and nodded

  careful msieu lorin i want the name of your client
towering passion seized lorin he erupted in pyrotech-
nics of word and gesture he seemed on the point of throw-
ing his visitor out bodily michael quietly learned forward
picked up a glass paperweight from the desk and hit the
man between the eyes with it

  lorin fell forward into his chair senseless michael was
not dramatic but he was efficient

  michael retrieved his pearl and pocketed it then he
went to the safe and rummaged among the papers and
notebooks

  he had not far to look almost on the top was an agree-
ment by which lorin was to receive twenty thousand
francs for a black pearl of no less than twenty grains

  the agreement was signed by julie favre

  michael stared kt the signature he swallowed hard
folded the paper pocketed it and left the apartment with
that paper burning his pocket with his brain in flaming
chaos he none the less kept his self-control and went di-
rectly to the surete

  information for the official in charge of the jewel
maniac murders

  that was all he would say imperturbable resolute
burning-eyed he did no chattering so presently he was
sitting in an office with a thoughtful keen pleasant in-
spector to whom he told his entire story in few words

  the inspector sent out for certain documents looked at
them nodded and offered his visitor a cigarette

  information yes but no proof msieu he said calm-
ly we cannot take action upon such flimsy evidence
what evidence must you have demanded michael
search this womans apartment-

  tut tut msieu this is france not russia came
the reproof but you have done superbly so far suppose
you continue in two of these murder cases we have dis-
covered the same fingerprint it is i grant you a womans
print

  whose impossible to say it fits no known criminal
well get us a fingerprint or prints of this favre
wojnan if it should be the same i promise you we shall
then take all the action you desire

  and said michael if m lorin makes a charge
against me for hitting him

  the official winked and chuckled my son let him
try are you not one of us not officially of course but
none the less an agent of the surete and if you obtain
those fingerprints and they match-ha thunders of
heaven but you shall really be an agent

  michael smiled at this and took his leave he did not
ask them for help for ways or means for advice

tvtor did he next morning when he met eramian in the
 usual cafe indulge in confidences or ask any help
there was something strange and terrible in his single-
handed independence in the indomitable resolution that
drove him straight to his end

  he sat down at table with the armenian and took out the
little box that held the pearl

  take his eramian as security he said i want you
to lend me that big unset aquamarine that was given you
to sell lend it to me until this evening if anything hap-

pens to it the pearl will cover it a dozen times over

  eramian who was not only clever but monstrous wise
took the pearl from its bed of cotton examined it and
grunted

  it is damaged he said

  incredulous michael took it screwed the loupe in his
eye and inspected the pearl true that delicate nacre was
cut and broken on one side michael remembered how the
fat hand of lorin had closed on the gem a ring no doubt
had done this damage

  no matter it is still good security for the aquamarine
he said calmly eramian looked him in the eyes for a mo-
ment then nodded

  i said the angels would help you he observed and
hauled out his fat dirty old wallet from it he took a
twist of paper and extended it michael without a glance
thrust the twist and the stone it contained into his pocket

  during the day michael got what he wanted a little
box of the right shape from one of the big jewel houses
with a bed of emerald cotton then very carefully he
took the aquamarine from its twist of paper and polished
it before bedding it in the cotton

  it was a glorious stone a beryl crystal nearly two inches
long on the face of the rarest sea-green color the flaw
which had put it on the curb market instead of in some
rue de la paix window did not affect the ineffable purity
peculiar to this gem

that evening having slipped past the concierge with
a likely story he knocked at the door of julies apart-
ment she opened started at recognizing him and he sur-
prised a hint of terror in her eyes then she flung the
door wide

michael it is the little michael she cried warmly

  he evaded her embraces accepted an aperitif and a
cigarette sat down and chatted she was dressing to go
out to dinner he promised not to detain her and got out
the box

  i thought you might know where id have a chance of
selling this he said simply

  she opened it saw the stone and sat silent once more
he saw her tremble saw her breath come fast saw her
dark eyes kindle

  this is one of the few stones that retains all its colors
and lustre under artificial light michael had picked it
for this precise reason julie who had grown more beauti-
ful than ever held it to her throat admired it against
the light with silent passion

  at last a call from the concierge interrupted her

  oh my escort-i forgot the time she exclaimed
and put the stone back in its bed of cotton ten thousand
francs you say but michael thats a fortune theres
no time now can you come back again

  yes he said ill come back again why not
tonight

  if you can yes she assented ill be home by
eleven

     the inspector of tjhe surete smiled as he listened
to michaels story they were waiting for reports on the
stone from the fingerprint bureau

  but my son you did not go far enough said the
inspector suppose you were right eh suppose she was
the killer then if you had gone back we might have
taken her in the very act it is not too late yet if you
prefer 


argosy

 michael shook his head gravely

 no i thought of that but one does not take chances
 with a devil msieu this way was surer if the stone
 has the right fingerprints well know

 a man entered the office with brisk salute

 no question about it msieu i the prints are those
 of the jewel maniac

 the inspector rose suddenly alert michael came to
 his feet also

 well he demanded what now what are you going
 to do

 take the first step toward the guillotine perhaps
 when she comes home well be waiting for her if youre
 right about everything else and we find the missing jewels
 -well my son come along and see

    the voices dimmed the faces faded away only
 a gray mistily moving luminosity lingered

 across this silvery mist now and again shot a sudden
 splurge of faint color upon this background began to
 grow something definite an upright angular object that
 took shape and form it was a guillotine

 it was not i a wailing womans voice fluttered and
 beat upon the room it was not i who did it i tell you i
 did not know-

 something left the top of the guillotine and swished
 downward the weighted knife clucked home out of sight
 the fluttering voice was gone a splash of color leapt part
 way up the high frame like a vast gush of blood   

 everything was gone once more gone in grayish fog

 ne wild sharp cry escaped the watching girl she had
  fallen backward in her chair in the dull light of the
 room shipman could see that she was lying senseless

 the luminous gray light slowly died away upon the
 room was rapping the voice of korvo imperious com-
 manding speaking some language shipman did not com-
 prehend

 with an effort of the will shipman controlled himself
 andsat motionless and silent korvos voice it was that
 of the boy michael older deeper yet the same voice

 and shipman knew that he had here seen a veritible
 vision from out the past korvo had been that boy michael
 the boy who had assumed a feud with this devil that
 would never end a feud deathless as eternity merciless and
 terrible as karma itself one woman had been brought to
 the guillotine and here in this room sat another woman
 whom korvo was this time trying to save

 a last febrile spurt of light shipman saw the girls
 face white and wan eyes closed a face like that of julie
 favre the same type at all events

 with a shiver shipman put his hands over his eyes
 the effort to keep himself immobile here was terrific he
 loved this girl who was so close so helpless so lost

 how long he waited he did not know at length he
 heard korvos voice

 chief come along and lend a hand

 he started up the lights were on korvo was chafing
 the hands of marie wilson her eyes were open her head
 was lifting

 she looked up at shipman as he came to her bewilder-
 ment filled her eyes	

 where am i what place is this she breathed oh
 you are mr shipman yes i must know you dont i
 but i cant remember anything much

 never mind youre quite all right now broke in

 shipman reassuringly you came in to look at a jewel

  a jewel she frowned but really there must be some
 mistake i dont know anything about jewels i never
 liked them much they seem so hard and cold

  shipman exchanged a glance with his assistant

  youve had a dizzy spell miss wilson come along
 into the other office and lie down for a bit then well
 call a cab and send you home

  she rose obediently with bewilderment still upon her

 t ater that day shipman returned to his office to find
 korvo awaiting him he sat down at the desk bit
 at a cigar and eyed his assistant

  well is everything all right chief

  apparently it is said shipman it seems that shes
 had a mild case of aphasia of forgetfulness at least thats
 the way they put it shes with friends she hasnt much
 recollection of anything here-but thank the lord she
 knew me for a friend

  korvo smiled in his thin almost sinister manner

  but you know the truth and i know it chief
 damned if i know what to think  burst out shipman
 chewing at his cigar shes a different person entirely
 herself

  good enough said korvo

  well what about that story we saw or heard ship-
 man demanded hallucination was it or auto hypnosis
 korvo smiled chief youre an expert in physics in
 the study of light you know all about the cleavage of
 stones how theyre made how the cutting acts upon the
 light that passes through you know the chemical com-
 position of a diamond or a ruby

  but can you tell me what gives such a stone its
 beauty

  eh shipman frowned light of course

  and what is this thing you call light

  shipman eyed him for a moment i see i cant tell you
 either what makes the green in a blade of grass hm
 precisely is the light hallucination is the blade of
 grass auto-hypnosis much easier chief to accept it as
 something past our comprehension just so with the story
 we saw it was my own story i was that boy yes

  but how did we see it so vividly i dont know
 shipman shrugged and the pearl did your experi-
 ment succeed

  korvo nodded

  undoubtedly is not miss wilson herself again if
 you want to see what that elemental spirit or devil looks
 like here it is

  korvo had taken the snowy white cone out of the
 window he put it on shipmans desk and at the apex
 placed the pearl the black sphere with its steely sheen
 had taken on to the somewhat startled gaze of shipman
 a maleficent beauty

  take the thing away he said whatll you do with
 it

  put it in the vault for the present said korvo do
 you realize what possibility of evil lies in this pearl chief
 if it got into the wrong hands if the devil within it were
 to exert a mental influence upon persons

  all im thinking about broke in shipman is that
 miss wilson and i are dining together this evening and
 i trust many an evening hereafter for which i owe you
 thanks

  and the two men exchanged a smile of comprehension

  murder goes to sea

by allan r bosworth

here is a new and absorbing story for argosy
readers of our navys hospital ship consola-
tion of murders on the high seas of homicide
in the place meant for healing

when the new six-million-dollar submarine starfish sinks
mysteriously off the california coast lieutenant everett
bral ix the skipper is threatened with the ruin of his career

a mustang officer risen from the ranks after being dis-
charged from the naval academy for a boyish prank brill
has already had trouble enough-including a court martial
which cleared him of charges of intoxication after his ship the
bolton had rammed another ship in maneuvers

and now twenty-two of his men have been lost in the un-
explainable flooding of the starfishs after compartment others
are injured and brill himself is sick

when a rescue ship finally reaches them with a diving bell
the skipper-much against his will-is among the eight to be
taken up first for adams first-class torpedoman has pur-
posely knocked him out making him a casualty-so that he
will be saved

the other lucky seven include first the injured

mike way chief torpedoman and master diver who found

a bottle on the skipper and hid it in the boat it smelled of
alcohol

lieutenant mcquaid engineering officer who was the last
man out of the flooded after compartment he had saved the
men forward-and doomed those behind him-by shutting the
galley door against the inrushing water

cardoni machinists mate whose brother was behind that
door he had taken a swing at mcquaid and they had gone
down together breaking cardonis arm injuring mcquaids
skull

then there is another sailor kowalski the kid john
thorpe and two civilians victor melhorne chief engineer
and foster bedell naval architect for the westco iron works
builder of the starfish

 mong those left behind are lieutenant james executive
officer and adams who gave up his own place to the skip-
per and they are left behind in great peril for as the first
load reaches the surface the diving bells downhaul cable is
carried away

this means another job of diving before the rescue can go
on-and the sea is rough for such work

back in the naval hospital meanwhile news is anxiously
awaited by three people

evelyn brill the skippers beautiful daughter who is fol-
lowing the family career as a navy nurse

dr vincent ayres who is in love with evelyn and




argosy

  gruff old admiral j k wetherbee retired who has been
laid up in sick officers quarters with a broken leg he knows
what the disgrace of a court martial would mean to lieutenant
brill

   anxiety does not cease with the arrival of the casualties
mcquaid in his delirium has been muttering dark things
which are-translated into rumors that lieutenant brill was
drunk before the tragedy

   the skipper assures his daughter that this is untrue but
does tell her that he had had to give mcquaid a dressing down
and that the junior officer resented it

fphe atmosphere is heavily charged cardoni whose brother
was left behind tjat closed door talks bitterly of mcquaid
-hopes he doesnt live

   the old admiral insists on being transferred to the hospital
ship consolation-at sea where he belongs

  and martin west builder of the submarine arrives with
his daughter barbara he is in a state of jitters-not about
the men left behind in the sunken pig-boat but about his
government contract what will happen to it now he seems
worried about a competitor who may take it over-the pacific
maritime company

   then just after evelyn learns that the hospital ship con-
solation is to be sent to the scene of the sinking and that she
is assigned to go with it she has a shocking message from
vince ayres

   mcquaid whom dr ayres has operated on successfully has
died-and not naturally he has been clubbed to death in his
bed   

chapter vi 

the admiral didnt sleep

she never remembered leaving the nurses quarters
she found herself stumbling along the hedge-rimmed
walk with a fine blowing drizzle cool against her
cheeks and making the dimly-lighted grounds even darker

  somebody moved yonder with a flashlight and she heard
men calling to one another

  an automobile swung around the driveway to catch her
full in the glare of its lights startling her it sped to the
curb before the administration building and stopped there
with a squeal of brakes

  she saw captain jessup jump out he was the medical
corps four-striper commanding the hospital a little bald
man of about sixty

  he slammed the car door and hurried inside and evelyn
heard loud voices in the personnel office where the chief
pharmacists mate of the watch and the master-at-arms
force had their headquarters

   she took the stairs and arrived breathless in the entrance
of the reception room at sick officers quarters

  all the lights were on now and there was a semi-circle
of white drawn faces at first glance it appeared that
everybody who -had been in the room earlier was again on
hand sitting and facing vince ayres

  she saw her father looking more stunned than before
mike ways rugged features were set in bleak hard lines

  vince came toward her gravely she heard cardonis
voice no longer bitter i didnt mean what i said i didnt
mean what i said about wishing hed die

  vince took her arm evelyn he said so low the others
couldnt hear i hate to drag you into this  but theyd
have called you anyway and you can help

  keep your eyes and ears open and watch everybodyi
theres one man missing the youngster-thorpe
that kid vince he couldnt-

  here comes the captain vince interrupted

   jessup was more the physician and surgeon than an
  administrative officer he tried now to keep the anxiety
  out of his voice and to sound military

   what steps have you taken dr ayres

  the master-at-arms force and the civilian night watch-
  man are watching the fence sir vince reported

   i notified the marine sentry at the gate to allow no one
  to leave the grounds and i called out the marine guard to
  search them

   nobodys gone out the gate in the last two hours except
  mr west and his daughter they grew tired of waiting
  here and left for their hotel that was forty minutes ago
  according to the gate sentry ive telephoned for them to
  return

   you didnt notify civil authorities-the police

 no sir	

   good ill report to the commandant as soon as i learn
  the details if police were called in the newspapers would
  be on our necks and linking this-er-affair to the starfish
  disaster we must try to keep down the scandal

   now suppose you tell me everything you know

  ves sir vince drew a deep breath his long sensitive
  face was pale and solemn but his eyes and glasses
  appeared as cool and clear as ever

   evelyn found a seat beside her father everett brill took
  her hand and held it tightly his palm was sweating now
  the fever she thought with relief was broken

   she saw that the night nurse miss wilkins had jined
  the group and there were two corpsmen both looking
  frightened

   mcquaid was in number five quiet room sir vince
  ayres began

   number three is unoccupied admiral wetherbee is in
   number one and lieutenant brill was in number seven
  all the odd numbers have windows opening on the balcony

   i know that captain jessup said impatiently a
  buzzer sounded in the hall miss wilkins said thats the
  admiral answer it murphy

   he was killed just before midnight sir vince went on
  the corpsmen were changing watches miss wilkins was
  in the diet kitchen getting-a trace of ironic amusement
  touched his voice-a cold turkey leg for the admiral

   murphy was relieving jacobs as the special watch over
  mcquaid they both went into the diet kitchen too-
  murphy to refill mcquaids ice cap and jacobs to get
  lieutenant brill something to eat

   the captain glanced at brill at midnight

   yes sir said brill flushing i couldnt sleep i
  hadnt eaten for twenty hours i called him as the watch
  was changing and asked for a couple of three-minute eggs
  when murphy went back to number five vince
  resumed he found mcquaid dead or rather dying he
  was still breathing then

   whos murphy the captain asked

   the redheaded corpsman captain miss wilkins said
  hes answering the admirals bell here he comes now
  doesnt the admiral ever sleep demanded jessup
  what did he want now-another turkey leg

   no sir murphy answered he wanted his fountain
  pen filled hes writing in his log sir an entry about the
  murder he said

   vince ayres looked queerly at evelyn captain jessup
  cleared his throat murphy how long were you out of the
  quiet room
murder goes to sea



  about five minutes sir i had to chop some ice when
i went back i started to put the ice cap on his head and
-and then-

  he hesitated and captain jessup turned on vince ayres
again go on doctor did you find the murder weapon
not yet sir we found the window open but i looked
for wet footprints in the room and there were none then
-he reached into the seat of a club chair-we found this
on the balcony

  he held it up something cold ran along evelyn brills
spine and laid clutching fingers on her leaping heart

  it was a scarlet-lined nurses cape her cape there was
a darker stain against the crimson lining and the rain had
already started spreading it

lince ayres voice sounded flat deadly apparently
 it was used to wrap the murder weapon captain the
weapon would have been heavy and blunt this cape not
only averted the chance of fingerprints but deadened the
sound of the blows

  mcquaids skull is badly crushed perhaps youd like
to look at him

  not yet said jessup he took the cape and looked
up sharply yours miss wilkins

  she was a mouse-like woman of past forty she gasped
heavens no captain

  its mine captain jessup said evelyn jirill calmly
she felt her fathers hand tighten spasmodically mike
ways eyes were on her and those of all the others she
could feel them

  only vince tried to look elsewhere and she remembered
what he had said theyd have called you anyway

  out of the corner of her eyes she could see victor mel-
hornes heavy face there was almost accusation in his pale
unwinking stare foster bedell rubbed a palm across his
stubbled cheek and the beard made a rasping sound

  do you know how it got there captain jessup was
asking her	

  no sir i-i think i must have left it here in this
room

  she felt confused after the shock of the telephone call
she hadnt rememberedgoing into the rain without a cape
but her white uniform was damp

  miss brill left here hurriedly to pack and get some
rest vince was explaining kindly shes one of the draft
for the consolation captain and shes been under a con-
siderable strain i-

  someone was coming up the stairs everybody looked
that way and saw martin west puffing into view barbara
west was holding his arm

  she had removed a portion of her makeup at the hotel
and didnt have time to renew it her heavily mascaraed
lashes were incongruous against her pale cheeks

  my god west panted the one man the one man
who knew who did it doctor who killed him

	 it down mr west said vince he pulled out the
 club chair for barbara thats what were trying
to find out and you may be able to help us

  west raised a fat hand quickly i dont know anything
about it-not a thingl and neither does my daughter
none of us does vince said patiently but you and
miss west had an advantage you left at the approximate
time the murder took place and you were out here where
you could see anyone who came in or went out something

 none of the others could notice from their rooms did you
 see anybody

 not a soul west said emphatically not a-
 father the girl said there was one man remember
 the young sailor thorpe his name is i believe he came
 through here and went out on the balcony before we left
 thats right west nodded id forgotten

 vince ayres face was a grave mask how was he
 dressed

 why-he was wearing pajamas and a robe like all
 the others barbara west said i remember his eyes he
 looked-well dazed and frightened

 mike way snorted the kid has been scared to death
 since it happened doctor surely nobody thinks he killed
 the lieutenant 

 vince turned to everett brill im not thinking be did
 he said but hes the only one missing and weve got to
 check up

 lieutenant brill in your opinion would thorpe have
 had any reason to commit such a crime-taking into con-
 sideration his mentally disturbed state which might have
 magnified a small resentment out of all proportion was
 there a grudge that you know of

 mcquaid brill said slowly put the boy on report-
 twice but good lord thats nothing thats no grounds
 for suspecting thorpe hes just a kid why-

 the admirals buzzer sounded again murphy arose with
 a resigned air and went down the hall captain jessup
 fidgeted

 i suppose id better notify the commandant he said
 dr ayres you carry on nobody is to leave this room
 if thorpe is found i want to be notified at once

 aye aye sir vince said

 murphy came back carrying a book its the admirals
 log sir he reported as he handed it to vince ayres he
 says he hasnt been asleep yet tonight and hes jotted down
 his observations here wants you to read it

 vince ayres turned the pages half-curiously half-humor-
 ously until he reached the last entry he studied this a
 minute in silence then looked up his mouth was com-
 pressed his eyes grave

chapter vii

murder for shipmate

 tnsomniacs ayres said slowly are usually cursed
 - with over-active imaginations but admiral wether-
 bee has well-developed powers of observation as well

 im going to read what hes logged tonight

 if anybody chooses to take offense ill ask you to re-
 member that this is a murder and that none of us is entirely
 free of suspicion until the murderer has been found

 he lifted the logbook and began reading

     january continued in dry dock as before

     first rescued survivors of starfish reported aboard
 several suffering from injuries

     lieut jg frederick mcquald u s n under-
 went operation for fracture of skull

    admiral  k wetherbee notified request for
 transfer to hospital ship consolation approved

     to  preparing to get under way for sea

    lieut jg frederick mcquald found murdered
 in room five this station who-and why mysterious in-
 cidents noticed remarks overheard etc include

    at about  man identified as cardoni john joseph
 mm c u s n of starfish survivors heard to express


argosy

 hope mcquaid would die at about  a womans figure

 hesitated on balcony outside my window appeared to be
 wearing nurses cape

    but nurses shoes have flat rubber heels do not click
 nurses not allowed to wear perfume   

 barbara west gasped that is a deliberate attempt to
 insult me doctor she exclaimed angrily its obvious
 that i am the only such woman at this hospital tonight i
 wont listen to that sort of nonsense father please take
 me back to the hotel

 martin west half rose but vince ayres motioned for
 him to remain seated

 i must remind you again he said gently the gate
 is guarded nobody can leave now if youll permit me
 to finish reading

    at approximately  a mans figure passed open window
 in rain he was carrying something over his shoulder

    it might have been a swab handle or something heavier

    motives for murder revenge possible but not likely
 jealousy  must inquire into any love affairs mcquaid had

    most likely motive hinges on fact mcquaid was apparently
 only man who knew what happened in starfishs after com-
 partments to sink ship

    mcquaid heard while delirious muttering about smell
 whpt sort of smell ether whiskey somethintfin submarine
 -whatt must find out

 vince ayres put down the book and then as an after-
 thought handed it to murphy

 return it to the admiral with my thanks he told the
 corpsman tell him ill talk to him later about the case
 and congratulate him for me on the fact that hes going to
 sea after all

 there was a commotion at the stairway entry a mem-

    ber of the master-at-arms force appeared with the old
 civilian night watchman they were dragging a man be-
 tween them a slender figure in a rain-sodden bathrobe
 thorpe exclaimed lieutenant brill

 vince ayres nodded impassively and the two brought
 thorpe forward and pushed him into a chair he had a
 fresh scalp wound high on his forehead and he looked to
 be only half conscious he was sobbing in convulsive jerks

 get some aromatic spirits miss wilkins vince said
 whered you find him mccarthy

    walking by the west fence said the watchman carry-
 ing this

   he handed vince a broken billiard cue it was wet by
 the rain

   foster bedell shuddered my god  he murmured -he
 couldnt have done it why he just isnt the kind
 whered he get this cue

    theres an old table in the corner yonder vince said
 slowly mccarthy did he offer resistance is that where
 you hit him

   the night watchman nodded yes sir i had to he
 came walking straight at me and he was carrying that
 shillaly like a gun i hollered for him to halt and put it
 down but he came on i dodged and tapped him with my
 billy

   miss wilkins forced the aromatic spirits into young
 thorpes mouth he coughed and sat up more erectly
 his eyes lost their dazed expression

   all right thorpe vince said talk up what were
 you doing out in the compotind what were you doing
 carrying this club

   i-i dont know  the boy said i dont remember i

 went to bed and  i dont know thorpe shuddered

 try to remember try hard vince said grimly
 something has happened and you may find yourself in
 a bad spot unless you can explain whered you get this
 billiard cue

 thorpe shook his head i didnt know i had it sir he
 said dazedly and passed his hand across his brow my
 head- its bleeding what happened

 take it easy thorpe vince cautioned he examined
 the cut this will need a couple of sutures miss wilkins
 if youll get me a surgical kit-

 rphe abrupt excited entrance of captain jessup inter-
 rupted the hospital commander faced martin wests
 chair angrily

  mr west did you tell the newspapers about this
 he demanded

 why no certainly not west said i-i told them
 that i planned to take my own salvage equipment to sea if
 the navy will let me the reporters left 

 im afraid i did mention the murder to the hotel clerk
 as we left though i-i was very upset

 jessup boiled over that was very thoughtful of you
 sir now there are a dozen reporters and cameramen at the
 gate	v

 im sorry captain west said contritely he looked
 flabbly and white and helpless in contrast to the others

 ive some news for all of you mr west included
 jessup snapped the commandant has instructed me to
 order you all aboard the consolation at dawn

 a murmur rose it came from west and his daughter
 and from victor melhorne and foster bedell navy people
 being that said nothing

 but i cant go  west protested the contracts and
 i need melhorne and bedell at the yards

 captain jessup eyed the civilian group with something
 like disdain barbara wests pale face clearly showed the
 distaste she felt a luxury liner evelyn thought would be
 more according to the girls choice

    everybody who was in soq is to be kept together
 jessup said the inquiry into mcquaids murder will pro-
 ceed aboard the consolation

    dr ayres ill give you written orders placing you in
 charge for the present therell be no newspapermen out
 there not on the consolation at least

    vince said aye aye sir and looked at evelyn brill
 neither had ever dreamed of going to sea under such
 strange circumstances neither had ever thought of sailing
 with a murderer for a shipmate

chapter viii

orders are manacles

 vince ayres felt more like a cop than a navy medical
 officer he stepped out of the first station wagon as it
 halted on the dock turning up his raincoat collar and
 watching two other machines come to a stop

    wind whipped the drizzle into a soft mist that was like a
 thin wet curtain fluttering against your face

lights dripped and ran in reflected pools the docks
asphalt and worn timbers might have been mahogany

    the gangplank creaked to the rise and fall of the ship
 and black water sucked noisily under the pier pilings

he turned his back to the wet wind and checked the
murder goes to sea



muster list of the party as they went aboard the consolation
admiral wetherbees stretcher went first manned by a pair
of hospital corpsmen

   they carried him properly up the gangway head first
but he let out a sea dogs bark as they reached the deck

   way enough the admiral boomed and sat up rigidly
to face in the direction of the quarterdeck he saluted
and his gaunt old face was soft under the gangplanks lights

   carry on he said simply when this respect had been
paid

   watching vince felt a lump in his throat and wished
the consolation had been notified that the admiral was
coming it would have been nice he thought to see side-
boys pipe the old man aboard in style

   he checked the names nurses were next mae kennedy
miss malone miss ballew evelyn brill and the drab
little miss wilkins whod been on duty in soq

  lieutenant brill was holding his daughters arm a
borrowed raincoat covered his stocky form

  vince touched evelyns arm see that he has some
cough medicine before he turns in he said and she smiled
gratefully

   there was strain on all these faces and a bewilderment
no one could leave ashore victor melhorne and foster
bedell waited at the gangway for martin west and his
daughter to precede them

  odd thing vince thought-civilians boarding a navy
ship going to sea

   barbara west lifted her expensive fur coat and the gown
that was beneath it as she crossed the wet gangplank there
was no need for this and vince marked it as another index
to her character spoiled and petty and capable-he
dwelled a space on the thought-capable of a quick jealous
anger

  navy men followed even in civilian clothes vince
thought he would have known they were navy men it was
in their manner of going aboard and the way they saluted
both the officer of the deck and the gangway

   young john thorpe his eyes wide and haunted under the
strip of adhesive that covered the scalp cut-thorpe halted
briefly looking down at the dark noisy water

   and cardoni his dark facegrown more stolid kowalski
his curly head bare and one cheek bandaged then mike
way

rphe big chief torpedoman alone seemed alert fatigue
- dropped easily from his rugged frame and his bruised
ribs had been taped so that he no longer had to hold his
hand against the pain of his breathing he stopped and
saluted

   dr ayres sir i want to put in a request i want to be
sent over to the algonquin so i can dive

   vince smiled take if easy chief havent you had
enough trouble you wouldnt want to come up with
bends

   no sir but i could stand the pressure i could get
that cable secured to the starfish sir will you let me
dive

   well see later vince said he patted the big mans
arm get some sleep now

   aye aye sir

  vince ayres understood twenty-five men still down
there in the submarine shipmates of mike way as those
who had died had been shipmates the word means some-
thing in the navy

  he checked off the hospital corpsmen who had been sent
along they included the two men who had been in sick
officers quarters when mcquaid was murdered-murphy
and jacobs

  then he went aboard and a deck detail at once began
shipping the gangplank the consolation was sailing before
sunrise

  she had just been commissioned in the navy but she was
old in sea service

  formerly a passenger vessel of some nine thousand tons
she had been replaced in the coastal run by larger and more
luxurious liners after war abroad shut down on transatlantic
sailings

  the navy bought her knocked out some of the cabin
bulkheads to create wards on both the main deck and the
promenade deck and installed hospital equipment includ-
ing a well-lighted operating room aft over the fantails

  the consolation gleamed palely in the wet dawn under
her fresh coat of white paint she looked like a ghost ship
and she was so empty of personnel vince found as to
further this illusion

   only a skeleton staff of the doctors nurses and corpsmen
she would need had so far been put aboard

   the deck force was billeted in the focsle and this left
more than a score of rooms that had once been passenger
cabins available for the party that had just come aboard

  assignment of quarters found the enlisted men chortling
that at last they had found a navy they liked they were
paired in the rooms that had once been tourist class cabins

  the nurses and barbara west had rooms to themselves
as did vince ayres and everett brill

  admiral wetherbee was already being made comfortable
in a roomy cabin aft martin west foster bedell and
victor melhorne were established amidships

  everybody vince told them will muster in that small
isolation ward on the main deck at eleven oclock so we can
resume the investigation youd better sleep fast

he turned in yesterday seemed an age ago an
eternity crowded with incredible things the full
horror of mcquaids murder struck him as he lay wide-eyed
feeling the-tremor of the engines and the beam roll that
began when the consolation backed into the bay

   a weariness lay heavily upon his eyelids but his thoughts
ran restlessly while light grayed in the porthole glass

  he thought of everett brill-the submarine skipper had
taken a room two decks down where he would feel more at
home

  he thought oj the others considering one by one the
persons who had been in soq before and after somebody
-one of them-slugged an unconscious man to death

  but there was no really tangible clue remembered there
was nothing on which his fatigue-fogged mind could base
the foundation and rear the structure of the crime

   it was a jumble of personalities and possible motives too
confused for him to untangle

  he came then to more pleasant thought evelyn brill
with changing ballroom lights on her coppery hair and
the whisper of her evening gown in his arms

   she had still been beautiful under those other lights in
the harsh brilliance of the surgery still beautiful but very
impersonal and far away

  it was hard to dissassociate her from the navy and
those few women who were in the navy couldnt get
married

    in a room on the starboard side of the main deck admiral
    wetherbee shook ink into the point of his fountain pen
    it was no trick at all for a man accustomed to only three
    or four hours sleep nightly to do without sleep entirely
    he propped his back against the pillows and made an entry
    in his logbook

      u s s consolation  january moored as before
       made all preparations for getting under way

       pursuant to orders of commandant admiral j k
    wetherbee u s n retired reported on board with
    hospital draft in command of lieut vincent ayres mc

    u s n

       murder inquiry ordered to convene at 

        dispatched urgent message to commandant to advise
    course of procedure in regard to lieut everett brill
    usn captain of the late u s s starfish

       got under way for scene of starfish disaster

 captain at conn navigator on the bridge standard speed
    standing out of harbor on various courses conforming to the
    channel   

      note why did no one in soq hear blows of weapon
    used in murder of lieut mcquald blows of force
    sufficient to crush mans skull are not exactly silent and sev-
    eral men were within earshot

       mus consider this important question   

   xince ayres entered the isolation ward at two
    minutes before eleven and rapidly ran his eye over the
   group asembled there

    -he said good morning and the chorus of greeting re-
    minded him of school days everybody he noticed ap-
    peared freshened	t

      chief he told mike wayill appoint you master-at-
    arms your first job will be to see that murphy and jacobs
    muster here theyre aboard for this inquiry and not for
    duty have them bring some more chairs

      waiting he walked to the porthole nearest him and
    looked at a gray sea running restlessly under the sullen
    sky the rain had stopped and the fog was broken it
    drifted now in scattered ghostly patches that hugged the
    shifting hollows

      the swells were high and the consolation rolled creak-
    ingly

      vince became conscious of perfume subtle and near he
    thought of admiral wetherbees logbook and turned to find
    barbara west at his side

      she had managed to get luggage sent from the hotel
    before the consolation sailed and now she wore a yachting
    costume of blue skirt and red tailored jacketwith exagger-
    ated brass buttons

      vince would have guessed that this shade of red had been
    especially created to match her lipstick

      yes miss west

      my father doesnt feel well doctor she inclined her
    head slightly toward one of the bunks

      mike way and the two corpsmen were bringing in chairs
    and everybody but martin west was sitting down -he lay
    in a lower bunk his eyes closed and a faintly green cast to
    his broad face

      nothing looks more helpless vince thought than a sick
    fat man martin west built ships but he couldnt sail in
    them

      i wonder if youd mind excusing us the girl went on
    ive told you all i know and father doesnt know any
    more it was a silly thing our being forced to come on this
    ship in the first place

      vince manfully put down the anger that rose within him
    no doubt it was he said you must be missing no end
    of important things teas and weddings and engagement

parties he kept his voice quiet watching her

  the girls dark eyes widened and vince noted the re-
action curiously more surprise than resentment he
thought

  he said im sorry miss west for your father too
but unfortunately medical science has discovered no cure
for seasickness he can lie here and hell be no more mis-
erable than in his room please take your seat

   her eyes flashed at him in evidence of that quick temper
she turned with haughty anger and her heels clicked across
the deck vince beckoned to evelyn brill

  youve had stenographic training he said please
take notes on all that is said and done here you may use
this pad of temperature charts for the present

                                                           

lieutenant brill shifted anxiously in his chair
doctor he began have you heard anything i-i
overslept ancl-

  yes vince said i made my call on the captain just
before coming in here and i saw the latest radio dispatch
the divers are still having trouble trying to secure the
downhaul cable

   but the men in the starfish told the algonquin by hull
tapping that theyre all right they have enough food air
and water for several days

	a spasm ran across young thorpes thin face brill drew
a deep breath

  of course he said as if trying to convince himself
of course i ordered those emergency tanks filled the
water will taste though it always does in new tanks

  and they have canned rations and enough soda lime to
fight the c they can always put on the momsen
lungs

   his voice trailed off

   foster bedell said im sure theyll all be saved captain
and youll be glad to know that the navy has approved
mr wests offer to have the westsal steam to the scene
shes very well equipped with diving and salvage rigs

  bedell had shaved and he had slept but his dark eyes
still showed red splotches at their corners and a nervousness
lay in the lines of his lean intense face

  from his bunk martin west groaned something about
contracts and vince ayres cleared his throat anxious to
get the inquiry under way

  were going towesume where we left off this morning
he said ill talk to you one at a time in the nurses
office

  i want all of you to remember that so far no one is
accused but that each and every one of you-of us-may
be under suspicion

  because-and he paused for emphasis-it is almost
a certainty that the murderer of lieutenant mcquaid is in
this room-

    the nurses office was a small glass-enclosed room
in one corner of the ward vince hoped for a psychological
effect here those who waited outside could see the ques-
tioning but unless voices were loud they could hear nothing
through the glass

  he beckoned to john thorpe all right thorpe well
start with you again come on in

  the door opened on the passageway and an officer
entered followed by the chief master-at-arms of the con-
solation a chief boatswains mate who wore a duty belt
and star

  vince looked up inquiringly 
murder goes to sea



 sorry dr ayres the officer said and hesitated

 then crisply the captain has just received radio or-
 ders from the district commandant to arrest and detain
 lieutenant brill

chapter ix

three minutes to kill

 uvelyn brill stifled a little cry she dropped the
 fountain pen she was holding and it rolled eccentrically
 with the lift and fall of the ship

 everett brill sat as if frozen his face gone gray for a
 space then he rose squaring his stocky shoulders

 lead the way please he said with dignity

 mike way retrieved the pen as the door closed on a
 silence he whispered dont worry miss brill

 vince waited until she had gone into the nurses office
 and then he and young thorpe followed

 sit down vince said now thorpe this is what we
 know mcquaid was beaten to death somewhere around
 midnight the slayer apparently wrapped his weapon in
 miss brills cape which was found lying on the balcony

 the window was open the murderer may have escaped
 that way may have entered from the outside tod for all
 we know or the open window may have been a ruse

 i dont know anything about it sir thorpe said in a
 high edged voice a boys voice scarcely changed

 you were brought in a little while later by the master-at-
 arms and the night watchman you had been carrying a
 broken billiard cue im having that cue examined in the
 laboratory thorpe can you cemember now what you
 were doing with it

 thorpe swallowed and his face worked no sir i
 dont remember anything-not anything not till they hit
 me

 the billiard cue vince said softly would have been
 capable of breaking a mans skull

 i didnt do it the boy moaned i guess-i guess i
 must have been walking in my sleep

 vince ayres exchanged surprised glances with evelyn
 and was silent while her pen scratched over the tem-
 perature chart

 he remembered that barbara west had seen thorpe pass
 through the reception room she had said the sailor looked
 dazed

 it was quite possible the doctor thought that the shock
 of thorpes submarine experience could have produced a
 mental condition that might result in somnambulism

 it would take time to check on this

 but could a man murder in his sleep

 thorpe he said you didnt like mr mcquaid hed
 put you on the report twice did you hold that as a
 grudge

 the sailor sprang to his feet and his voice was loud
 enough for those outside to hear

 i didnt have near as big a grudge against him as the
 skipper he blurted mr mcquaidwas going to accuse
 the captain of being drunk

 vince avoided evelyns eyes he looked through the
 glass and saw those in the ward react

 mike way stiffened and muttered something and
 barbara wests eybrows went up in thin lines as she met
 melhornes pale gaze 

  this he realized with an acute sense of shock was the
best motive for murder so far advanced

  we dont want any hearsay testimony thorpe he
said quietly what do you know of this first-hand sit
down and talk calmly now we want the truth-the facts
i heard him ask captain brill if he was all right said
the sailor i could smell the captains breath too it
smelled like alcohol the captain got kind of sore and
told mr mcquaid to get aft

  and then-he raised his eyes defiantly-then i saw
the captain take a drink out of a bottle later after it-
after it happened-mr mequaid kept mumbling about the
smell

  did you ever walk in your sleep as a child

  why i-i dont know sir i guess not

  thats all thorpe youd best not talk to the others
about this youre at liberty for the time being

  thorpe closed the door evelyn said it looks bad for
dad vince if even the enlisted men thought he was
drinking 

  you keep your chin up young lady vince said im
going to have a talk with your father later theres some-
thing we dont know going on here

that arrest-the evidence might warrant arresting
thorpe but not your father i cant understand the order
from shore unless they found something at the hospital-
the murder weapon evelyn said maybe they found
it

  maybe but we know he didnt do it so keep brave
she met his eyes and managed a smile well she
said wholl be next

  vince consulted his watch well have time to question
one more before lunch and afterward i want to send a
radio message or two ashore to a man i know in intelli-
gence 

  meanwhile batten down the hatches for a storm were
going to talk to miss barbara west and unless im mis-
taken she can tell us something 

she entered with haughty flouncing defiance and took
her seat with an air of utter boredom she said dr
ayres this continues to be utterly silly youve no right to
cross-examine me	i

  it might come to the point of criminal court and news-
paper publicity unless you cooperate now vince warned
you wouldnt care for front page notoriety would you
certainly not but-

  didnt i see your photo in the society section some
time ago

  the girl lifted a red-jacketed shoulder perhaps she
said icily why not ive done some club work for
charity

  my impression is that it was an engagement announce-
ment your engagement

  then im sure you must be mistaken she said what
has that to do with this case

  possibly nothing vince admitted he rose and paced
the small room he looked outside and saw the others sit-
ting in attitudes of impatience

  both foster bedell and victor melhorne were watching
the office

  the two hospital corpsmen and a pair of the submarine
men-cardoni and the curly-headed kowalski-had pro-
duced a deck of cards from some place and were shuffling
them to play on the deck


argosy

  what-vince turned suddenly to the girl-what
were you doing on the balcony last night

   her dark eyes blazed ive told you i wasnt just be-
cause admiral wetherbee says he smelled perfume-

  and saw the silhouette of a woman and heard high
heels clicking vince added

ince took another tack your father stands to make
 a great deal of money if he builds twenty more sub-
marines for the navy by the same token he stands to lose
a great deal-millions-if he loses that contract

   the girl stiffened what are you driving at now

  its up to me to examine all possible and probable
motives forthis murder if lieutenant mcquaid alone
knew of some fault in the starfishs construction-some-
thing that sent her to the bottom-it would be unfortunate
for westco when he regained consciousness and talked
why youre virtually accusing father you-

  vince smiled grimly not exactly remember i said
possible-and probable motives your father isnt alone in
his interest in those new submarines

   there are for instance mr bedell and mr melhorne
thats all crazy barbara west declared she fidgeted
on the edge of her chair suppose there were a flaw in the
ship itd be found wouldnt it theyll raise her
maybe not for some time vince said not if the
fleet is ordered to the atlantic as it expects to be no
there might be ample time to fulfill that contract the way
shipbuilding is being rushed today

   ive told you all i know the girl insisted i saw that
sailor-thorpe-leave and he was found with that club

i dont see what more evidence you need

   vince resumed his pacing miss west he said its
very important that we know just where everybody was at
the approximate time of the murder and just before it
took place look at this its a diagram of s  q

   he took a sheet of paper from the desk and handed it to
the girl her hands were trembling

   it would have been easy for anybody in one of the odd-
numbered quiet rooms to open a window step out on the
balcony and go to mcquaids room-number five he
went on

   the admiral was in one he couldnt get out of bed
number three was vacant	

   lieutenant brill was in five we know a corpsman saw
him in bed at the time the lieutenant asked for some three-
minute eggs

   barbara west flashed a feline look at evelyn three
minutes she drawled is just about enough time to kill
a man

  perhaps said vince but we know he was there
melhorne was in nine nobody went to answer his bell
he didnt ring as lieutenant brill did so we dont know
that melhorne was in his room he might-

   mr melhorne was asleep barbara west said quickly

vince straightened and there was a peculiar glint be-
hind his crystal-clear glasses he turned his long
sensitive face toward evelyn brill and said

i wanted to be sure of that miss west so that thered
be no need of going farther into that line of inquiry itll
help if you explain now why you went out on the balcony
all right  the dark-haired girl said suddenly she took
a cigarette case from her bag fumbled at it and finally got

 a cigarette between her tight lips vince lighted it for her

 she said oh i havent anything to hide theres nothing
 to be ashamed of i went out tfiere-yes to the far end
 of the balcony where mr melhornes room was

 why vince insisted

 to tell victor-mr melhorne-that father had
 changed his mind that we were going to the hotel after
 all

 why didnt mr west go

 i-i also wanted to tell him goodnight

 vince said oh go on

 but thats all oh yes-the cape it was raining and
 i saw the nurses cape lying on a chair i threw it over my
 shoulders to protect my dress

 vince nodded and glanced at evelyn your cape he
 said now you told mr melhorne goodnight and then
 returned to the reception room you-

 no said barbara west thats why i know he was
 asleep i couldnt wake him at the window i could hear
 him breathing but i suppose after-after that previous
 night in the submarine he was sleeping too soundly so
 i went back

 you took the cape from the chair vince said did
 you put it back there

 barbara west shook her head no i dropped it on the
 balcony i was frightened a man came along with a club
 i know now who it was of course thorpe but when i
 saw him i ran

 i see vince murmured he opened a notebook and
 turned through its leaves for a minute then he said miss
 west may i ask why you didnt go down the hall to mr
 melhornes room 

 the girl colored i think im entitled to keep my reason
 for not doing that to myself i didnt wish anybody to see
 me

 that-that isnt the way it sounds it happens that
 victor and i are engaged but only father knows it and
 if id gone publicly down the hall mr bedell and others
 might-

 im sorry i asked you vince said humbly i think
 that will be all now thank you

 and as he opened the door for her will you please
 tell the others to go to their dinner well muster here
 again at two oclock

tte faced evelyn when they were alone she said with a
sigh well vince are we getting anywhere

 i dont know i know this miss west hasnt really
 told everything either that or the admirals log is off and
 knowing the admiral i dont think the latter is true

 you heard her say she saw the man with the club on
 the balcony well the admirals log puts her there at
 about  thats ten minutes past eleven

 and he puts the man with a swab handle or something
 heavier there at -fialf past eleven

 what do you think vince about thorpe

     i dont know he confessed i must go by the labora-
 tory and see what they found on the billiard cue nobody
 would pick thorpe as a murderer hes more the bewildered
 boy type no i think what miss west revealed is more
 important

     what made you so sure-about her and melhorne 
 mean

      he sat on a corner of the desk lighting a cigarette and
 grinning through the smoke
murder goes to sea



 i wasnt sure but did you ever see colder eyes in a
 man and they warm up a little only when hes looking at
 that girl

 so i dropped a hint that melhorne might be accused
 and she rose to the bait protective instinct-its strong
 in all women

 but what do you think she hasnt told

 she hasnt told everything about that man with the
 club im sure of that oh she saw him all right in the
 rain and the semi-darkness one man would look very much
 like another

 now suppose she saw him come through melhornes
 window after she left it it wouldnt have to be melhorne
 he might have been sleeping so soundly anybody could
 come through his room

 but barbara west would be afraid it was melhorne
 the protective instinct comes to the fore

 she actually didnt have to tell us anything but she
 didnt know how much we knew and she decided to estab-
 lish an alibi for him so she says he was fast asleep

 but the time element doesnt jibe she and the admiral
 may have seen two different persons

 one of them thorpe evelyn said

 exactly and the other-the murderer

chapter x

the deed was on ice

 the old navy custom of a brisk walk on the quarterdeck
 after the midday meal sent vince ayres topside a
 man could think better up here too

     but there was the distraction of the algonquin tossing on
 the swells less than a quarter of a mile away her small
 cluttered deck showing a bustle of activity

    she put out a motor sailer and two stretcher cases were
 taken aboard the hospital ship divers suffering from the
 bends despite hours in the salvage tugs decompression
 chamber

    vince watched them grimly remembering that mike
 way wanted to dive a shadow fell across the rail and he
 looked up to see the big ugly chief

    mike way saluted doctor sir he began i thought
 maybe youd be wanting to talk to the captain i heard
 what thorpe said-about him drinking

    yes vince nodded im going to ask him a few
 questions

    could i go along sir i know a little-about that
 bottle

    vince turned toward the hatch no time like now
 chief come on

    they descended two ladders vince said i havent had
 an opportunity to discuss this thing with you but id like
 to know something about the feuds the grudges-that
 seemed to exist on the starfish

    i know about thorpe and mcquaid of course what
 were the others

mike ways blue eyes were honest he said well of

course mr mcquaid was sore at the captain but that
would have wore off the captain may not wear an academy
ring sir but hes a real skipper if there ever was one and
hed have had mr mcquaid eating out of his hand in an-
other couple of weeks-and liking it

  go on vince said

  thats all doctor except cardoni i wouldnt call
that a grudge cardoni was out of his head when he took
that poke at mr mcquaid hed have realized in a little
while that the lieutenant was only doing his duty when he
shut that door

txow about the two civilians bedell and melhorne

      any resentment toward mcquaid or anybody else
shown by them while they were on the bottom

  no sir mike way said positively they acted like
white men all the way through

  the pair came to everett brills room a sailor wearing
a duty belt was stationed outside- the consolation carried
no marines-and even before the sentry had unlocked the
door vince could hear brills caged restless pacing

  the submarine commander turned quickly as they en-
tered his iron gray head thrust forward and hope leaped
into his eyes

  vince said theres no word yet lieutenant theyre
still working i came down to ask you a few question

  if i could just be down there with them brill said
brokenly if i could help some way i thought perhaps
theyd let me go over to the algonquin and-

  he spread his hands helplessly but he began talking
again before vince could say anything why am i under
arrest doctor regulations say an officer must be informed
of the charges against him are there any charges

  i dont know any more than you do vince said just
that the order came from the commandant of nineteenth
naval district

  if its because of the murder brill declared thats
one thing and if its because i lost the starfish thats an-
other ive got a right to know 

tt was easy to see that he considered a murder charge
trival compared to an accusation of negligence in the
submarine disaster he was still a dazed harried man

  lieutenant he said i have to ask you some questions
that bear on the mcquaid killing they go back to the
starfish however ive learned that mcquaid apparently
had some sort of row with you and that he entertained
the idea youd been drinking

  brill stiffened that was between- mr mcquaid and
myself there was friction yes

  but the suspicion that you were intoxicated-

  i wasnt of course brill snapped then he smiled
without mirth it was a silly thing and could have been
explained in a minute if i hadnt been bullheaded enough
to believe that no junior officer was entitled to an explana-
tion

  i had a bad cough as you know the pharmacists mate
had fixed me some cough medicine lets see terpin-
terpin something

  elixir of terpin hydrate

  that was it i wanted to carry the bottle in my pocket
so i poured it into a small flask-a fiat half-pint bottle
there was no label on the bottle doctor but that was
nobodys business either

  i guess the stuff has a pretty high alcoholic content


argosy

enough to smell the odor is something like liquor-or
rather like a liqueur might have

  thats true vince said the pharmacists mate
could have explained

  he was-one of those men caught aft brill said
and once more the starfish and her men oytweighed every-
thing else in his mind

  mike way broke the grim silence i took that bottle
out of the captains pocket sir when we hoisted him up
the hatch i thought-

  look here chief brill exclaimed are you the man
who struck me there in the darkness

  the torpedoman grinned his hearty approval of that
blow but shook his head

  no sir i dont know who did that captain but i
took the bottle and dropped it behind the torpedo rack

  thats one reason id like to dive dr ayres i want
to get that downhaul cable secured and i want to tell the
crew of the rescue bell to have somebody bring up that
bottle

  youll wait vince said grimly there are other divers
in the outfit well lieutenant thats all i have to bother
you with just now

  i might ask you the one question we are all asking
have you any idea who might have had reason to kill
mcquaid

  brill looked at him squarely i have not doctor i
cant conceive of anybody-any man who was in my ship-
dreaming of doing such a thing and i can see no reason
for it

as vince and mike way climbed the ladders the big
chief swore softly of all the dumb tricks he ex-
claimed

  i thought i was doing the skipper a favor by ditching
that bottle i knew mr mcquaid had out the old squirrel
rifle for him and he looked kind of red in the face and-
i understand vince said as the chief halted lamely
there was a loyalty here that transcended rank it played
a large part in making the navy what it was

  it was a fever chief he was ill not drunk he should
have turned in on the sick list instead of taking that ship
out for trials

  but there was the testimony young john thorpe would
give to the board investigating the starfish disaster i saw
the captain drinking from a bottle 

  whether he had been placed in custody because of the
murder or because of the loss of his ship brill was in a
tight spot

the afternoon seemed to be dragging so far as produc-
tive results were obtained in vinces questioning but
admiral wetherbee-vince made up his mind hed visit
the old sea dog later in the day-sent in a copy of the latest
entry in his log

  and this offered the only seemingly logical explanation
of a matter that had been puzzling vince and others

  it happened that he was discussing this phase of the case
at the time while examining cardoni the dark-faced
machinists mate was ill at ease still grief-stricken and
shocked and very contrite

  i know it looks bad for me doctor he mumbled jeez
i kept sounding off about how i wished the lieutenant would
check out because-because he was the one that shut that
door but i didnt mean anything i didnt mean what
i said

  i understand that cardoni vince said gravely he
glanced at evelyn who was recording the testimony and
suddenly asked hows your arm did it pain you last
night

  a little sir but they gave me a shot-in the good arm
oh it hurt some but i slept i was about pooped

  you slept soundly then

  cardoni looked wary i didnt leave my bunk sir not
till they broke us out to say that mr mcquaid had been
killed

  you didnt hear anything or see anybody in the hall
your door was shut

  yes sir it was i didnt hear a sound ive been think-
ing it was funny me right across the hall from the lieuten-
ants room and not hearing the-whoever it was-slugging
him

  before i went to sleep i heard him mumbling a couple
of times about that smell

  the hospital corpsman came in just then and handed
vince a sheet of paper he looked at it and smiled the
admiral had sent the logbook itself last time

  i wonder if admiral wetherbees making some private
entries to be made public later vince chuckled this
is just a portion of todays log all right cardoni thatll
do lets go out and read this to everybody miss brill

   author of kid calamity stars in my crown etc

we just stood there all ten of us gazing up at
mann hill with our mouths wide open i remem-
ber it was bitter cold for the smoke plumes of our
breath hung in the frozen air and i thought

  were like a pack waiting for the stranger to show how
brave he is hell always be an outsider until he can make
us respect him in some way

  far up on the snowy slope of mann hill we saw the
small dark figure of the lone skier thrust his sticks down
hard the wind had scoured the mountainside and left a
wind-board crust

  now nels nelson executed a jump-turn and then sticks
trailing he crouched and began the swift descent

  my heart began to pound nelson was rushing down
that slope faster than any of us had ever dared to take it
he dipped rose dipped again he rose to a slight up-run
and then seemed to gain new momentum as he hit the last
sharp swift drop to the base of the hill there were the two
red flags which oscar troll-the new austrian coach of
skiing at yarnell-had thrust into the snow

  nelson would have to swing between those two flags
with a stem-christy to finish with a quick tempo-turn at
the last flag it had to be good or hed crash into that
stone wall at the end of the orchard

  i was scared plenty scared

npwenty minutes before nels had come flashing down
that same slope at a speed none of us had ever at-
tempted he ended his run with a quick jump-turn-a
hard thrust of the sticks a leap and turn in the air with
skis parallel and at right angles braking in a spume of
snow

  mein gott oscar had whispered how he can do
that one

  we-the rest of the yarnell ski squad-looked at one
another and didnt speak that praise coming from oscar
at that moment probably did more to make nelson an out-
sider than anything he could have said

  youll understand how we felt most of us had prac-
tically grown up on skis mel harris our star was rated
one of the best downhill-run skiers in the east and now
a tall pale-faced lanky swede from the west was out-
shining us in our own new england

  at oscars remark i saw anger stirring in mels cheeks
his dark lean face with its high cheekbones showed ani-
mosity and i knew that from that moment he and nels
would be enemies

  lucky run thats all he said let him try it again

  oscar said maybe-again then

  nels came running along in an easy one-two step on
the level snow the way he thrust his sticks into the snow
and glided along showed me hed been on skis since he was
knee-high to a juniper

  nice run i said as captain of the squad i always
tried to smooth over all breaches of good feeling on the
team oscar would like you to try that again nels this
time finish with a stem christy and a tempo-

  nels looked at me soberly i try it reed



ahgosx-march 


argosy

  he was one of those tall rawhide-muscled youngsters
who dont look strong but who can probably outrun a
horse id liked him the first day he had reported for ski
training in the fall and in a way id felt sorry for him too

  he hung about on the edge of all the kidding talk that
went on his eyes friendly and wanting recognition but
there was something about his flat pale face with its shock
of blond hair topping it that the fellows didnt warm up to
he didnt fit in he wanted to desperately and the more
he tried the more he got the cold shoulder

   the first time i saw nels on skis i felt a strange excite-
ment about the skill he showed we needed a good down-
hill-run man and this stranger from montana had the look
of a champion

  it was mel who shot the barb twenty minutes before
that made me wonder if nelson might be so good after all

  next time he had sneered do an immelmann turn
we like flashy stuff you know

  it was plain that nels had thought the senior meant
that for a compliment he wasnt used to sarcasm

  oh that wasnt much he said softly ive been doing
jump turns ever since i was a kid this hill isnt anything
to some of the hills ive done in the west

  he meant that honestly and without boasting but to
mel it was like a kick in the teeth he lost his temper then
and the damage was done

  high-hatting us eh he said darkly you dont really
know what tricky skiing is youd better watch out or
youll smear your brains over a stone wall-that one at the
bottom of the hill

  oh dry up mel i snapped go ahead nels take
the run again and forget what these yaps say

  but nels had suddenly grown pale he leaned there a
moment on his ski sticks and looked as though hed caved
in in the middle his face was pasty-white his lips moved
jerkily and his blue eyes stared back in sudden horror at
the run hed just made at express-train speed

   yes-yes of course ill go he said

  he started back up the hill but the old confident swing
he had shown was gone he acted as if he was afraid-
and that on the last steep slope down to the stone wall
would be suicide

tvtow i saw him come flashing down the last steep incline
-  like a bullet and i said a prayer for him hed been
scared when he climbed the hill-he was scared now

  but i found myself thinking if he can do mann hill as
fast as he did before what can he do in the downhill cham-
pionship run on the thunderbolt

  he seemed to be making good time-as good as he had
made on the first part of the run he rocketed out of the
last turn at close to fifty miles an hour he approached the
first flag

  i heard oscar groan aloud in disgust

  nels in a spray of flying snow had suddenly stemmed
his speed he shot in and out of the first curve in the
slalom with his speed cut in half the tempo turn he made
in the last quick lithe shifting of weight was a mere carbon
copy of that first magnificent descent

  dont ask me to explain how we felt theres something
about a good fast descent on a pair of skis that tkes your
breath away you feel like youre flying-shooting down
through the snowy woods or out onto an open slope at close
to fifty miles an hour

  the man who can do it never slows his speed any more

  than necessary and with oscar i knew a trick like that
was unforgivable

  and now nels had suddenly pulled a stunt that not even
a novice would have thought of doing

  when he came running up his skis slithering in the
snow oscar bristled his stubby mustache and growled
not so good tomorrow maybe again and he walked
off with his stiff austrian back showing how angry he was

  two faint spots of color burned in nelsons cheeks i
felt sorry for him the way he looked off after the squad
which had turned its back on him and was stringing across
the snow toward the gymn

  he had wanted to do that slalom a second time yet hed
muffed it but why in some way mels remark had
frightened him was he really yellow

  kicking off my-skis i stood up

  im going home in a few minutes nels-as soon as ive
had a shower ill walk over with you

  there was a gleam of something resembling gratitude in
those washed pale-blue eyes he tried to make his voice
non-committal as he nodded and turned away sure he
said

tte was waiting for me when i came out and i noticed
that none of the rest of the fellows said anything to
him as they went past he just stood there his hands
thrust into his pea-jacket his eyes hurt and troubled

  look nels i began yarnells not had a champion
ski team in a long time last season rifled us of all good
material there are only three men who show anything like
championship form this season youre one of the three
id expected gratitude but nels merely said thanks
in a toneless voice and stared off morosely at the white
slopes of mann hill i tried to figure what he was thinking

  look i said if you can keep mel harris off your
mind well get somewhere you know scrapping never
helps a team-and you know oscar troll is the best coach
in the east

  again nels nodded his face was still solemn

  i know

  you stemmed all your speed on that last run i said
thinking maybe i could help him was anything wrong
no- and this time there was even more hesitancy in
his voice nothing is wrong

  there wasnt any use pressing him i could see that and
so i left him at the corner he murmured something about
some school work and left me standing there staring after
him the cold seemed to get right down inside my bones
i shivered

  he walked off with his skis tucked under his arm they
were home-made skis and id taken the time to admire
them the first day hed come out for practice on mann
hills lower slopes

   i used to run the mail up through to a couple of logging
camps in the mountains he told me his blue eyes shy
and hesitant in summer i rode horseback but in winter
it got pretty deep-drifted too much for a horse so i
skied and i kept thinking about coming east to school-
it was something id always wanted to do pretty soon i
had enough money saved so i could

  it was all pretty interesting to me but to some of the
rest of the fellows on the team it seemed a little naive per-
haps mel had snorted in glee at the strangers homemade
walnut runners

maybe they arent such a good-looking pair nels
trial by thunderbolt

ended in confusion but ive sort of got used to them
now i thought maybe i could help out a little on the
team this year

  you can i said and now id just seen what he could
dp on mann hill to tell the truth i wasnt so sure id
done the right thing in encouraging nels

  and yet i hated to see a man with the rhythm speed and
coordination that he showed suddenly lose his nerve and
quit trying why that was what puzzled me

t was still thinking about it that weekend when we got

  together for the cross-country run over bald knob it
was a clear cold day one of those crystalline days when
you can see fifty miles and when everything seems to be
sharp and etched on your memory afterward

  thats the way i remember that afternoon and nels
nelsons part in it it is sharp in my memory-and yet
somehow unreal

  as usual i led the way but before long i dropped back
to watch the rest of the team come stringing past down the
snowy slope mel harris was running easily in the lead his
skis stirring a fine spindrift of hard snow

  and then at the rear nels came running along

  for the moment id forgotten what poetry in motion a
real ski run could be like with the even forward thrust of
the pole to shoot you forward and the sweet glide of the
runners over the pure white cloud of rising and falling
slopes but looking at nels brought it all back to me
never before or since have i seen such beautiful rhythm
such perfect control of the polished and waxed runners

  so long as nels was on the level he was all right j he
didnt see me now but went on by with a strange keen pleas-
ure evident in his face

  the descent of bald knob is a series of terraced slopes
all the way to spring creek where a low stone wall sep-
arates the pasture from the road

  mel took the slope first i could see him flying down
with the swift rush of an eagle into the turns between the
clumps of alders riding the slopes like a driven bolt of
blue the last of the run was a sharp pitch and most of
the fellows i knew would take the road in a swift jump-
turn

  but not mel he took the jump with a beautiful
geldndesprung-a swift downward thrust of the sticks
and then i saw his lean form shoot across the stone bar-
rier at unslackened speed hed learned that trick in
austria a pretty bit of skiing but useless

e followed mels path down pretty much one
by one the fellows dropped off swiftly down into the
valley until only nels and i were left

  he had come up last and when i looked at his face i
thought he seemed pale

  go ahead i said

  nels shook his head im a little winded you take it
first

  i shrugged and then with a shove i was off down the
slope the snow was almost dry-not too powdery but
slightly moist-so that bald knob was like a greased bil-
liard ball

  the snow hissed from my runners stung my face i
began to pick up speed and at that instant a strange ex-
hilaration began to stir in my blood dont ask me to ex-
plain it-skiing is something like gliding it gets in your
blood to see the snowy woods rushing up to meet you a

   second later i was shifting weight twisting turning shoot-
ing in and out among those dense snow-covered alders

  forty fifty fifty-five miles an hour with only those
waxed polished runners beneath your feet

  something caught at my throat my eyes tears blinded
by the swift rush of cold air blurred my vision i saw the
stone wall rushing up to meet me i made a jump-turn and
slithered to a stop beside mel harris

  wheres nelson he asked i shook my head blink-
ing the tears back

  i dont knowl said and turned to look back up the
slope

  we saw the lanky westerner still standing there how
long hed been there trying to force himself to the descent
i didnt know but the sight of him standing on the top of
that snowy hill gave me a sinking sensation in the pit of
my stomach suppose he did lose his nerve and crack up-
not on this slope but on tuckermans or kter on the
thunderbolt   

  there he comes somebody said

  the next instant nels was flashing in and out of those
clumps of alders i saw a spray of snow shoot up whenever
he stemmed to brake his speed it was clear he was taking
no chances

   finally he shot out onto the lower slope directly toward
that low snow-covered stone wall

  hed better try the golf course mel laughed shortly
if its coasting he wants

  shut up i snapped look he doesnt see that wall

  all the rest of us knew that wall but nels came gliding
on down that last steep slope totally unaware of it if he
smashed into that at the speed he was going hed break an
arm or leg-or his neck

  hell take it i whispered to myself hes got to-

  just then nels saw that wall instead of executing a
swift jump-turn he suddenly knelt on one ski and dragging
the other he slowed his speed in a telemark i almost
groaned aloud

  hed used a novices trick to keep from jumping that
wall

  i heard mel say in a satisfied tone lost his nerve
again i dont see why you keep that guy on the squad
reed

  at that moment i couldnt have told anyone just why i
did either but you cant kick a perfectly good skier off a
team just because he funks a jump-and besides i still
felt that if i could get the key to that hidden fear in nelson
wed see a champion in him

  now nels came running up to the barbed-wire fence he
placed a hand on it and vaulted it easily skis parallel it
isnt any easy trick to do that and it convinced me that
he was an expert

  whats the matter mel snickered didnt some-
body tell you there was a stone wall at the bottom

  i-i might have smashed into that stone walll nels
said in a husky voice

  nobody said anything you just dont talk about things
like that usually

next saturday we went up to mt washington for a
test run on tuckermans ravine that is a stiff
dangerous slope and i felt a little thrill of fear when i
looked up at that snowy headwall near the top it was just
far enough down so that if you spilled near the start you
tumbled hundreds of feet to the bottom of the headwall


argosy

  some run mel said staring up at the frosty skyline
you taking it nels

  the lanky blonde-haired westerner shot him a keen
glance

   yes of course he said ive done that sort of a slope
before i-

  mel gave a nasty laugh dont go on and tell us youve
taken something twice as steep as that in the rockies
maybe you have but theyre open slopes out there take
that headwall up there now-you could smash your brains
out on it anybody want to lay a bet on the fastest time
there werent any takers mel knew and we all knew
that he would come flashing down the run in the best time
he was sure of it just as he was sure of every run in the
east hed been taking them ever since he was a kid that
together with his schobling in the arlsberg technique made
him invincible

  come on i said time we shove off

  while we climbed to the top i kept thinking about the
look that had come to nels nelsons eyes when mel men-
tioned the headwall for a minute i was tempted to order
nels not to take the run that day but i wanted that kid to
whip whatever it was if id known what it led to later id
probably not have been so all-mighty sure that what i did
was right

e reached the top far off to the north we saw
the mountains lying like black pencil marks on a
gray horizon below us the slope dropped away in a
swift smooth whiteness-that was like the open mouth of a
pit

  fast today oscar troll said he looked like a short
fat little gnome with his cheeks shining with excitement
and the exertion of the climb he tightened his belt tugged
his cap on his head and gripped his sticks tightening the
rawhide thongs	

  i go first he said at the bottom i time you mars
you follow me down

  the next instant he shot off down the slope he seemed
to drop like a plummet crouched low as he shot into the
first turn snow spinning in a cloud from his skis how
that man could take the turns

  he didnt do a stem christy when he could have he did
a tempo turn instead its quite a trick-a crouch a slight
spring to unweight the skis- and then another twist and off
again from where we stood it seemed that troll merely
wriggled his hips and he had shot in and out of a turn at
racing speed

  the next minute the little austrian was far down on the
snowy slope he stemmed his speed raised his arm

 whew a skier said can he take it

  the westerner was staring down the descent glassy-
eyed his lips were tense white

   youre next mars i told a husky little junior dont
go hunting rabbits

  i whipped a flag down at the moment he shoved off far
below oscar would squeeze his stop-watch and then hed
write a record of each mans run on the time-sheet

  all nine of the fellows went down until only mel harris
the westerner and myself were left

  youre next mel told nels ill come along and pick
up the pieces

nels tightened his grip on the sticks okay he said
he was staring down at that snowy headwall hundreds
of feet below he shifted the weight on his skis and seemed

 about to shove off but then mel laughed thinly and said
 something that changed everything

    a chap cracked up on that headwall last spring so take
 it easy itd be a hard spot to reach to pull you out

    i saw nels hesitate he shot a startled look at mel and
 then drew back from the lip of the hill

    i-id just as soon go last he said

 personally id have broken every bone in my body
 before id let mel get away with that remark but
 nelson was fighting something he obviously couldnt lick

 i felt a little sick about it

 with a contemptuous sneer mel shoved off his skis
 slithered in the dry snow and shot up a little spray as he
 shunted into the first turn with a quick christy he wasnt
 taking any chances

 a minute later his rocketing figure whizzed down the
 slope and past oscar troll

 good time i said but you can beat that and you
 know it

maybe-

 there wasnt anything for me to do but lead the way
 forget everything mel said hes just a damn fool this
 run should be kids work for you well ill shove off good
 luck

 i didnt think about nels very long that first swift rush
 of the slope picked me up as if id been shot from a rubber -
 band a second later i was fighting to keep my feet try-
 ing to keep from tumbling down into that threatening
 headwall

 knees locked tight together hips swinging i managed
 to make that first turn but after that i didnt dare try a
 tempo i stemmed my speed and even when i shot into the
 open slope and saw oscar and the rest waiting i knew id
 made rotten time

 whats the matter reed mel laughed you got the
 jeebies from nelson too theyre catching you know

 i laughed but i wondered if maybe some of nelsons
 fear hadnt filtered into the squad

 then i heard mel whisper in a hushed unbelieving sort
 of voice good lord would you look at that hes
 climbing down

 we stared all of us up at that dangerous slope sure
 enough coming down that steep slope with his skis slung
 over his shoulder was the westerner

 right then i felt ashamed ashamed for him

 we were waiting for him seated in the bus with the
 motor running when he finally came up a good half hour
 later there was a lot of talking going on but it was turned
 off like a tap when nels poked his sticks and skis in the
 door

 he took a seat without saying a word im afraid i kept
 from looking at him by staring hard out of the steamy
 window

 tut still he didnt give up there was some strange
 streak in the westerner that never let him quit-even
 when he must have hated himself and us for what we had
 witnessed	

 that friday when we had a steak fry up at an old log-
 ging camp in the woods he came along it was one of those
 team affairs-a sort of exclusive party just for team men
 we always had it just before the downhill championship

 there was a big fire roaring up the chimney and steaks
 were sizzling on the iron grille over the coals-and there
trial by thunderbolt



 sat nelson at one side without a word or a look from any-
 one just staring into the fire

   i remember that i tried to draw him out but he an-
 swered in monosyllables and pretty soon i gave up trying

   about ten-thirty we started back there was a slight
 film of hard snow on top of a previous fall of soft snowso
 that spots were dangerous going we trailed out skiing
 fast and recklessly down that old logging road that twisted
 down the mountainside

   mel as usual was leading i was next and trailing the
 whole team came nels

   halfway down the trail it happened

   theres a big rock at the bend and a nasty curve if
 you hit that going thirty miles and upward per hour youre
 apt to do damage it was mars who crashed into it full tilt

   i heard the spill and knew mars was hurt badly when i
 got back to where he lay crumpled in a queer position
 against the rocks his skiis were twisted one was broken
 off short

   its my hip he said i cant move at all i feel
 awfully funny inside too

   there was nothing to do about moving him we had to
 have a doctor and have him quick now with the crowds
 coming into town for the weekend skiing and the downhill
 championship runs there should be a doctor at the tavern

   weve got to get somebody up right away from the
 village i said the quicker the better

   i remember looking down at the ravine at our feet it
 is one of those rocky tree-spotted gashes in a hillside that
 an expert skier could take-if he was in a hurry we all
 of us looked at it a second we were all thinking the same
 thing somebody had to make that descent

   that was why when nels spoke up in a tense voice we
 all turned to stare at him

   im going down maybe therell be a doctor handy
 ill bring him up the logging trail

   he dropped off down that black ravine like a shadow his
 sticks trailing and his lean body crouched for a sharp turn
 whenever a tree rock or stump crashed up at him out of
 the darkness i shivered looking down into that silent
 snowy void where nels had disappeared

   in a way i felt guilty for i was sure hed taken this al-
 most suicidal run down the mountain in a desperate effort
 to regain our respect

 tut then mars groaned and we forgot everything ex-
 cept trying to make him comfortable it got colder
 the moon which had been out when nels started now slid
 under a cloud things looked desperate

 maybe hes cracked up i said thinking of nels
 more likely hes climbing down mel said standing
 up and clamping his rawhide thongs about his hands ill
 take the logging trail and bring a doctor back up to the sta-
 tion at the foot of the hill

   there was nothing else to do presently we managed to
 get mars eased onto a stretcher made of our coats and skis
 it was clumsy but we did get him down to the station
 where we found mel a half-hour later with a doctor

   put the man down over here said the doctor in a soft
 voice

   i started and then stared openly at the little man with
 the black case he was a twisted deformed man who had
 clearly suffered some sort of an injury to his spine in his
 youth

   but it was his face i stared at he was somehow strange-

 ly familial i had seen those quiet blue eyes those tense
 lips somewhere before but where

   he moved quickly silently as he eased mars into a sort
of comfort his leg was broken close to the knee but no
worse injuries

   this man might have contracted pneumonia the doc-
tor said looking up a moment later why wasnt he
brpught down the mountainside sooner

  it was mel who spoke the truth he said we sent
somebody but he got scared probably tried to save his
own neck i guess

   at that instant we heard a sound in the waiting room
door we whirled and saw nels nelson standing there he
must have heard every word we had said

   for an instant his eyes rested on us taking in the glow-
ing cherry-red stove behind us the injured man on the
bench then he spoke not to us but to the doctor
hello sven he said softly his blue eyes wavered
he stood there his-face scratched and caked with blood
his coat torn to ribbons he stood there dumbly while we
all witnessed his disgrace for in one hand he held a pair of
skis-neither apparently injured in the slightest

   that meant hed taken them off hed failed again
hello-nels the doctor said and stood up as erect
as he was able to stand and then i got it

   this was nels brother

   you better let me fix you up sven nelson said now
you look like you need a little attention

   but nels shook his head bitterly and turned quickly
back into the night the next instant he was gone and
then i was following him running through the cold frosty
air trying to overtake the lanky figure who stumbled blind-
ly on toward the dormitory-alone

tt wasnt until we reached the room that i caught up
with him i saw then that tears stood in his eyes his
face was filled with suffering i said

   forget it nels things like that are bound to happen
mars will be all right and you wont have to take the
downhill tomorrow if you dont want to

he looked at me dumbly and then he started to talk
but ive got to he said ive got to dont you see
how it is sven came to see me do it hed never under-
stand if i backed out now hes counted on me being a
great skier like he was-

  your brother-a skier

   nels looked at me there was a desperate note of pride
in his voice as he said sure-sven nelson everybody
knew him twenty years ago

   the name clicked then sven nelson the worlds cham-
pion in the ski jump of course id heard that name be-
fore hed set a worlds record for the jump-a record for
skiers to shoot at for over a quarter of a century

   but how could the great champion be this crippled man
from montana nels read the question in my eyes he
said yes he is the same man he was hurt after he came
to this country he smashed in a pile of rocks i was just
a kid then but i remember he was brought home hardly
alive-he never could ski again

   he paused and i read the torture in his eyes when he
was excited too he lapsed into his strong dialect

  sven want me to become a champion-to carry on he
send me here to be a champion like he was i come east
where i will not be known maybe i can make good-but
now-


argosy

  i didnt speak after that there wasnt anything i could
say-truthfully nels alone would have to erase the shame
of refusing that dangerous trip down the ravine when an-
other mans life was at stake

  it was up to nels now i doubted if hed ever ski again

fphats why i wasnt prepared for the shock of seeing
him that next afternoon when we gathered on topof
greylock at thunderbolt run there were skiers from
every college in the east-champions amateurs onlook-
ers a colorful exciting crowd of thousands had strung
out along the entire course of thunderbolt

  we were all gathered there when suddenly i saw nels
come up the last steep grade with his skis on his shoulders
his face was set and pale except for two red spots of color
burning in either cheek

  nelsi i called and when he stopped i said in a low
voice you dont have to take this run you know weve
got plenty of men on the squad-

  he turned to look at me i noticed for the first time that
he was patched up a long ugly scar had been opened in
last nights wild run down the ravine there was something
in his dull blue eyes that made me shiver

  ive got to he said he had kept saying that to him-
self over and over i felt

  and he pushed past to report to the judges it was a few
minutes later that my name was called my turn to take
the thunderbolt

okiing people talk about vertical descents and max-
 imum grades well thunderbolt can be described as
being  miles with a racing trail  mile and  yards
long that describes it as perfectly as saying a west in-
dian hurricane is a strong wind

  i shoved off the wind began to whistle in my ears and
the woods seemed to start slipping by on two fast-spinning
wheels those black blurs on the woods were spectators

  i never knew how i made those first slopes but i do
remember suddenly coming out into the end of the trail and
facing a sheer white drop that looked like the end of the
world the steepest-and worst-of the thunderbolt

  sixty-sixty-five miles an hour my breath was painful
my whole body ached with the effort of keeping upright on
that racing shifting field of snow

  and then suddenly i was over the finish line tears
were streaming down my cheeks i heard the spatter of ap-
plause as i stemmed made a jump-turn and came running
back to where the yarnell squad waited

  good enough reed mel said looking pleased my
record is the best for the afternoon so far-looks like well
cinch it sure

  he meant all right mel did but he is one of those fel-
lows who cant think beyond himself so i said

  one more man to come nels is coming down

  i couldnt resist that thrust mels jaw fell then he
snorted

  that guy wont make it hes yellow-

  a voice at our elbows said softly i dont think so nels
may surprise you i turned it was sven nelson i
started to apologize but he waved a hand at me for silence

  he went on you didnt give him a chance to tell you
that he took the wrong ravine last night he tried to get
down a strange wooded hill hed never traveled before
that was why he was so late-

  hes started somebody shouted

t knew what he would be feeling and i knew that only

   two of us really knew the fear he felt as he flashed down
those upper slopes myself and sven would he spill on
those nasty turns spill and crash into those trees at sixty
miles an hour

   i glanced at sven he was staring with pale blue eyes up
at the snowy slopes wondering-praying for the lone
skier who came shooting in and out of those twisting turns
perhaps remembering the time he had crashed

   and then we could see nels he came rocketing into a
turn at dizzy speed even far below we could see the snow
spume from his skis we saw him snap in and out of a turn
with a quick tempo turn that seemed only to increase his
speed

  my throat was dry and i know that i was gripping
someones arm-svens arm-with aching fingers for the
worst part of the run still lay ahead of nels

   it all happened in less time than it takes to tell nels
shot in and out of the last turn now he faced the last
steep slope before the finish line

   i heard the crowd groan nels had swayed dangerously
near to the side of the run he caught himself a second
later he was rocketing down that snowy slope

   he came faster than any skier i ever have seen take
thunderbolt before or since he seemed to actually be fly-
ing his lean body humped low sticks trailing-racing
downward at a mile a minute

   the next instant he had rocketed across the finish line
i heard the roar of the crowd and knew that nels had set a
new record but the next instant that same roar grew to a
shriek of dismay

   somehow in some manner two children had broken from
the line and were racing across the intervening open space
where nels now shot like a bullet they stood petrified
with fear and then broke and ran one started directly
jcross his path

  look out

   to crash into those youngsters would mean injury to
nels or to them yet they were moving and a moving
mark was not easy to avoid while we watched nels did
the only thing that saved them

   he thrust his sticks forward and leaped bringing his skis
up under him as he did so his speed rocketed him up and
over the youngsters-a beautiful galdndesprung

   the next instant nels was running up to us while the
crowd prepared for tragedy suddenly began to laugh
the children were being brushed off the course by indignant
officials

   sven was waiting i felt a little tremor of pride in his
voice as he said

   you did it ever since you had the nerve to go down
that ravine on that dark night i knew you werent afraid-
not really afraid

   nels said i am glad it is not so bad that thunder-
bolt by golly i think maybe i take it again

   i think mel harris voiced all our feelings when he pushed
forward and took nels hand

   let me shake first will you nels some of us sort of
got things mixed up about you they didnt know a cham-
pion when they saw one

   nels said its okay excuse me now and ill take this
run again	 

   he did but he really didnt need to his first trip down
thunderbolt set a record that were still shooting at some-
how i hope we never better it

the sinister mystery of triangle town centers around the
year-old murder of rancher matt mchale since his
death his rocker-m herd has been ripped to nothing by
rustlers and his daughter mary ellen mchale is left with-
out an inheritance befriended only by dr george farabaugh

then mary ellen finds a new ally in cass gentry profes-
sional gunhand who comes to triangle with his partner
swifty ogden gentry is impressed by the trustworthiness
of dr farabaugh of frank irish the shrewd banker and of
abel bannister a rancher moreover gentry cannot bring
himself to blame the mchale murder on ollie shand a rustler
who is the chief suspect for shand saves the lives of gentry
and ogden but quite obviously vic barth the deputy is
somehow involved in triangles skullduggery and so is beefy
wash parsons the mayor then too there is martin bur- 
dette the smooth young lawyer once mary ellen mchales
fiance he has some place in the dark pattern and there are
two other mysteries which may or may not be important
what is the englishman talbot doing in town who supplies
the drunken duke costello with money

                                                         

at a nesters headquarters gentry discovers preacher
axton cardsharp and confidence man and buck chil-
dress a gunman whose brother gentry killed several years
before cass issure these men are in league with the rustlers
who keep raiding the neighboring rangeland

it is in a fight with buck childress that cass gentry acci-

this story began in the

dentally shoots queenie the gunmans woman because of that
terrible error gentry is branded a woman killer and his
enemies in triangle busily stir up lynching talk

   but that fever is forgotten when triangle is faced with a new
and particularly baffling tragedy mary ellen mchale finds
ada farabaugh the doctors wife strangled to death this
crippled and bitter woman has been a recluse for years and
the only apparent explanation of her murder is that she must
have surprised a thief in the farabaugh house for mary
ellen who lives there finds that her papers have been
rifled 

             chapter xxvi

                                                      

               let the dying speak

the viciousness of the crime gave mrs farabaughs
death an importance that overshadowed all other hap-
penings of the locality among the lesser items that were
briefly mentioned in the morning forums along wampum
street however were these details of various interest

  the nester woman out at the mills was still alive doc
farabaugh had reported that he was unable to remove the
bullet she had lost a lot of blood and her condition was
bad the next few days would tell

  martin burdette was preparing a law-and-order petition
to the governor and would carry it to the capitol as soon 
as enough legal voters had signed their names

  as far as martin knew thered been nothing of special
importance among those papers of mchales that hed
turned over they were chiefly business documents bills
and receipts and general records and he couldnt name a
soul who might consider them valuable enough to steal-
much less to murder for

  miz mustache-you know the gray house on division

street-had collected herself another sick-case shed
moved duke costello from his leaky shack into one of her
rooms claimed he was dying though everybody knew it
was just another bout of the dukes delirious trembles

  old doc riggins wasnt good enough for her either
shed called around on farabaugh-him with his wife
hardly cold yet-and insisted he take a look at duke
and doggpned if the doc didnt do it

  abe bannister had taken up headquarters in town when
abe got the bit clamped in his teeth there was no stopping
him he had announced that his volunteers would ride
the streets by night until all this mares nest was cleaned
out that frank irish had put up a thousand rewardfor
the capture of the killer and that triangle county would
see what was meant by action before the moon was many
days older meaning of course that when the right night
rolled around hed loose his vigilantes on the devils
pocket

  there were some who didnt see eye-to-eye with abe on
ollie shand what would ollie have wanted of any old
papers mchale might have had how could ollie have
picked the one exact hour when the doctor was off on a
trip and mary ellen was at church

  at the same time more men were beginning to agree that
stronghand methods were needed and that those rustlers in
the pocket were as good a crowd as any to start with for
years that hideout had been a stink to honest men and
now might be a good ripe time to blast and burn em out
of there

  old bearpaw that roustabout up to the star corrals
stood on the street and just about blubbered last night
claimed miz farabaugh mightnt been killed if hed been
keeping watch like he was supposed to he moved his
bedroll into the docs stable and swore hed never let matts
girl out of his sight again day or night from now on

  gentry yeah he was still around he would likely
sing a softer tune hereafter though seeing how almighty
fast his bluff had been called in the happy hour that
girl saved his bacon dont let em tell you different

  he was holed up now in that shack at the head of town
him and his dude-dressed amigo that nester woman had
missed him closer than hed thought as it turned out yep
her bullet had tickled a couple of his ribs small loss if
shed shot a little straighter triangle had guns enough of
its own to handle its own problems there was no need
here for a woman-killing gunswift

such was the trend of opinions and events in triangle
town on the morning following ada farabaughs
murder thus they continued gaining momentum until
the morning of her funeral

  they buried her on a gray wednesday the solemn
procession that followed her coffin turned into wampum
street shortly before noon with a dismal pomp of creak-
ing wheels with horses plodding slow the train of vehicles
crawled on an avenue of grim quiet as bleak as the over-
cast skies that hugged the hills

  past stores and buildings shuttered for an hour in respect
past men who halted suddenly hatless and humble-eyed
women who moved their hands in the symbol of that great-
est death upon mount calvary up the path of sorrows
sadly winding to the new brown grave in the field where
green mounds sleep in a row

  cass gentry stood at the edge of the road where the
wagon-yard of the star corrals marked the southern limit

of town and watched the snaking cortege dwindle he

turned to swifty shaking his head

  she dont mind it said swifty poor woman her
pains are cured her troubles done

  thats one way to look at it cass admitted somberly
i was thinkin though lookin up the street that trian-
gles troubles are just begun

  how so

  cant you smell it pardner it was in the looks of
that bunch that passed here a while ago this towns
primed so high that its got to explode its in the air

  my skin feels the same gooseflesh prickles that comes
over a herd when weathers breedin its too damn quiet
swifty and the skys squeezed down too close

  been like that for days said swifty most likely its
bannisters blow-off thats due theres plenty on the
street right now that didnt ride to town for the funeral
i noticed men cornin and goin all mornin long theres
been all kinds of talk

  feller was tellin me they aim to dynamite the pass
once the pockets cleaned out and fix it so the hideaway
cant never be used agin another said it was the plan to
keep three-four men stationed in that territory hereafter
just as lookouts to make certain no new bunch moves in

  bannisters mighty confident they say hes bribin in-
formation from one of-shgds best men and that hes
got a big-jawed trap all set to be sprung

  cass nodded thats what i know hes apt to cut
loose mighty quick-tonight tomorrow any day-and spill
the fat into the fire leastwise thats my hunch i know
hes on the wrong trail swifty but theres no way i can
steer him right the way that things have switched
around-our hands are tied

  suppose he does jump crosswise swiftys shoulders
hunched what harm is that to you and me hes let
us alone aint he we can do the same with him-he
grinned-since theres nothin else to be done

  yeah said cass dully theyve all let us alone best
we can do i reckon is go back and polish the seat of our
pants some more

rphey cut across lots toward bearpaws shack cass
- walked with a certain stiffness because of the corset of
bandages that compressed his upper chest except for an
occasional twinge his ribs did not trouble him as far as
he was concerned the cure was a bigger bother than the
injury

  swifty moving beside him lifted a covert glance to
his face he couldnt quite puzzle his partner out these
last couple of days cass gentry had never been what
youd call an easy book to read but it appeared to swifty
that more of the pages had glued themselves together just
lately

  cass seemed older somehow since the night of that
shakedown at the happy hour he had taken on a look as
solemn as an owls life was too short for that swifty
thought as far as swifty was concerned another real
good bust of excitement would be welcome right now a
hair of the dog might be the medicine cass needed

  at the shack they ate a little meal cass sat on a box
by the table afterward and rolled a cigarette he stared
at the window with that new-found frown of his and began
to talk some more the old cass gentry had never been
long on palaver he mostly did things and left it for other
people to jaw em over later
gunswift



  the trouble with bannister swifty he said is that
he hops before he looks hes inclined to the same mis-
take i made of crowdin things too fast i had good ad-
vice about takin it slow but i passed it by out at burnt
mills i upset the bucket on top of that the man that
killed miz farabaugh spilled a whole damn ocean

  i still cant figger who it might been swifty said
most everbody i could suspicion is accounted for one
way or another you reckon it was some stranger cass
one of that bunch from the mills mebbe

  i dont know who and i dont know why said cass
it beats me swifty    the hullabaloo that it raised
though he went on explaining a situation that swifty
thoroughly understood has just about cooked our goose
it stirred too many tempers the rats we got to smoke
out are layin lowern ever now

  yeah said swifty like that bushwhacker of ours-
that tex cordill his bodys never been found and no-
body seems to care a hoot what happened to im

  thats how it goes cass agreed we got a big sack
of suspicions but not a grain of proof amongst em and
when it comes to gettin proof were jammed both ways
from taw theyre too many and too watchful for us out
at burnt mills

  if i start a move against barth about that money he
lifted from cordill-no we could never force that angle
wash parsons might been made to squeal with the right
kind of squeeze but thats too late now hed deny any
deal with childress of course and we couldnt threaten
the truth from him without runnin foul of bannisters
vigilantes

  was he trying to apologize or something swifty won-
dered whod ever expect to hear such mealy talk from
cass gentrys mouth	t

  well what about them new little angles swifty asked
how about that map bearpaw found among the scatter of 
mchales papers anything to that

rphe map was a careful representation of the rocker-m
properties including the free range in the valleys that
mchale had claimed by right of usage eight inked
squares had been sketched upon it and notations in matt
mchales bold hand indicated these as the key segments
of his freehold the controls of water supply winter grass
storm shelter

  it was doggone funny bearpaw maintained that the
first homesteaders to push into the valleys had filed their
claims on these identical sections

  it raises a lot of questions said cass but it dont
prove none of em i been givin some thought to that map-
you thought over my other notion-about burdette i
mean suppose he bundled up some wrong papers into
that batch suppose they was dangerous and he had to git
em back he waited his chance till the crippled woman
was alone in the house-	-

  jts possible cass admitted more sense in it than
is in this ollie shand talk theres a man with brains
behind this deal here-a jigger who dont miss many tricks
thats what bannister is too bullheaded to savvy my
idea is that certain people would be pleased to see the 
vigilantes make fools of themselves in the devils pocket
that englishmans no fool said swifty they say
he carries a bale of that big-sized money of his that would
choke a mine shaft you recall what i told about him dont
you

  whats that

  why about that man friday of his that brown-
skinned cousin wouldnt know a mineral pan from a skillet
him and me has talked around and hes a cattle expert
hes ead erdsman for is ludship back at we thats
how the feller shoots his lingo

  anyhow he says us yankees dont have the first idea
how cattle should be raised his familys been at the job
for hundreds of years he says and could give us cards and
spades at it

  mebbeso said cass wheres that get us

  it struck me as queer said swifty this talbot
claims hes a minin man says hes lookin for mineral
properties yet evertime he rides to look around that
brown-skin cowboss trails with im

  cass frowned shrugging talbots dickerin with
frank irish for minin lands i heard he represented some
british syndicate if hes got other notions-well its a
crazy way to do business

  you never cherish none of my ideas said swifty
wagging his head whats our next move then
nothin said cass we wait and see some twist
is bound to develop swifty if we happened to be a dif-
ferent kind of men wed sit and pray as it is well just
sit and give our luck a chance to turn

  this couldnt be cass gentry swifty thought cass
gentry was the boy who always made his own luck this
gent across the table did resemble cass but all the same 
swifty heaved a deep breath and reached for the casino
deck

they sat and smoked and played listless cards while the
- hours passed they talked about nonsense yawning
and the mood of the shack was as blank and gray as the
sunless weather it was pointing toward five by bear-
paws tin clock when the luck turned

  it was something like a man in a poker ame swifty
thought who made up his mind to draw a royal straight
flush-and then drew itl
cass happened to spy her as she moved past the star
stable building she approached the shack by roundabout
hoisting her skirts like any lady as she hurried through
the grass they were standing at the door when she came
up breathing quickly

  please- she said glancing behind her and they stood
aside as she entered

  i had to com myself said madame mustache be-
cause i sent the boy away on a pretext a friend of mine
in the country will keep him at the ranch until tomorrow
the poor child does not know of course that his father
is dying

  the young un cass said toning his voice to her
semi-whisper costello dyin

  with every breath she said she tapped the black
silk of her breastbone he has known for years that his
lungs would kill him one more hemorrhage-

  she fixed dark eyes on cass i do not do this because
of your over-gallant street rescue mr gentry i know
your purpose in that

  but you have been good to the boy also i am sorry
for that poor young miss mchale it might have been
easier for costello to die in silence but i have convinced
him that his story should be told

  her glance moved quickly over the room triangle
town has become a dangerous place she said i came


argosy

here unnoticed i hope and you will be careful when you
come to my house i have a rear entrance which some
of my callers prefer to use i will watch for you there

   he is sleeping now but in a few hours in the early
 evening perhaps in the dusk you will come costello may
 be able to show you who robbed and murdered that peg-
 legged old hypocrite matthew mchale

chapter xxvii

the mourning house

 five oclock and the tall timepiece in dr farabaughs
 hall bonged out the hour the musk of the funeral
 flowers still faintly pervaded the house and the trailer of
 mourning crepe had not been removed from the main door

   the doctor was in the kitchen with maggie he put a
 sealed envelope into her hands

 a little token maggie in appreciation of your extra
 work your special consideration in these days since-
 oh no doctor i only did what any decent woman-

 i couldnt doctor-

   put it away he said its scant pay for all your
 trouble dont bother with supper ive got to go out and
 mary ellen can feed herself put on your hat now and
 go home and get some rest

   its you who need the rest doctor if youve slept
 a wink these three days an nights i dont know when it
 was

   he smiled faintly go on with you now

   i jist wanted to say doctor-i had no chance before-
 that when all is considered meanin no disrespect the
 good lord knows she may be better off-

   perhaps youre right maggie the body is a useless
 vessel unless the mind has something to live for

   he returned to his office his deepset eyes traveled
 slowly around the shabby redolent little room he soothed
 long fingers over his forehead drew them down with wip-
 ing motion across his bearded lips there was a filing
 hook upon the wall above his desk and he fingered the
 strips of paper it held then he mounted the stairs to the
 upper floor a somber black giant striding

 ivtary ellen was transferring an armload of clothes
 from the bureau to her bed an open valise was on
 the table she turned faintly smiling as he towered in
 the doorway

   now my loneliness will be complete the doctor said
 its not easy to see you go my dear i should have dis-
 cussed it with you previously but in the circumstances-
 i didnt think of it myself until this morning she said
 several of the neighbors were kind enough to offer-but i
 think a hotel would be best until the court settlement at
 least after that-

   i insist upon making your arrangements you cant
 deny me that mary ellen the palace would suit you
 i believe ill speak to joe foyle-

   she moved quickly to grip his big hand with both her
 own ill never forget how kind youve been i only
 hope that some day i can find a way to repay you oh
 doctor i cant tell you how sorry-

  hushi he stroked her shoulder awkwardly we
agreed not to speak of that again as ive said before i
owe you a debt of gratitude for the brightness that came
into my house with you i want you to count on me

theres very little i wouldnt do for a fine brave girl like
you how soon will you be packed

   oh just a little while half an hour

   i might as well wait then he said and carry you
and your luggage in my buggy there are a few of my
out-country patients who cant be neglected any longer

   according to the list on my hook theres a confinement
case that woman at burnt mills a sick child on cotton-
tail ridge i wish there were more if i can keep myself
busy i may be able to- he shook his head sorry

i didnt mean to say that

   you work too hard doctor said the girl you give
too much of yourself

  he chuckled im not exactly a weakling my dear
the farabaughs were built to endure i can still count
another twenty years or twenty-five of life in my carcass
his eyes narrowed as he regarded her youre the one
who must be careful a womans system cant stand-
his fingers captured her wrist measured the pulse-beats
he drew her closer thumbed back her eyelid i dont like
the looks- he muttered if i knew how to take you
away from all this-

  and suddenly his eyes held a deep glow why dont
you come with me my dear he said impulsively its
jane morgan who is having the baby her first you
know her youd be welcome there a woman would be a
godsend in her house right now i could leave you there
while i went on ill sleep the night at the mills i expect
and i could pick you up tomorrow

  she thought of a cramped room at the palace hotel
the lonely shadows creeping the walls the faces of staring
strangers

triangle is a troubled town the doctor said im
afraid of the looks of things youd be safer at morgans
caring for jane would lift your mind out of its sad rut
why yes said mary ellen theres nothing to hold
me here if i could be of help to jane-

   get your packing done he said ill fetch the lug-
gage when youre ready

he was arranging the vials in his medicine kit when
she descended to the office she skewed the long pins
that held her ribboned hat in place watching him

   ill leave word with bearpaw he said and that re-
minds me-i told henry gaunt i might see him this eve-
ning if i could get riggins to handle my calls henry felt
that cheering-up was what i needed you might write out
a note i could leave for him while im finishing here
she sat in the chair beside his desk with pencil and
paper what shall i write

  oh anything just say-lets see-dont bother to
look for me i have decided that travel is the better
solution to my problem yes that will do that covers it
mary ellen read the slanted words she had written then
passed them over for the doctors signature he glanced
at the slip of paper nodding

   look how nervous your hand was on that last line
he said a mild sedative is what you need young lady
before we start sit right there and ill fix it 
mary ellen sat listlessly she was dreadfully tired not
sleepy exactly but brain-weary those dismal days of
hush in the house of adas coffin in the gloomy parlor and
mourners trooping endlessly the pompous morning cere-
mony of the funeral-all the dreary emotions of them still
weighed her she wanted someone to tell her what to do


gunswift



to lead her by the hand she needed to find some place
where her thoughts would not be shrouded

  she thought of cass gentry thinking of him remem-
bering that wild dark moment of embrace had become a
curious consolation if she saw him now if she could
talk to him   

  but what would she find to say he had been careful
to keep his distance-not even a message that bearpaw
might have delivered-and perhaps his judgment was wise
in that it would serve no purpose to burden him now
with her own vague misery

  the doctor reentered with a cloudy mixture in a glass
he smiled down on her as she drank it 

  sit quiet he said just relax my dear the buggys
ready ill take your grips out and settle things with
bearpaw

  it was easy to sit there it was pleasant to be guided
and cared for a womans chiefest need was to be sheltered
to be protected

  bearpaw was not in sight when the doctor helped her
into the buggy she leaned back against the cushions and
already she could feel a soft languor that drifted through
her her eyes were heavy-lidded and she watched the
flow of the streets with hazy disinterest triangle town
was a sullen town in the dwindle of a dour day

  they were well along the northward road when mary
ellen straightened with a faint laugh my luggage she
said we forgotto drop it off at the palace

  the doctor looked at her with glowing eyes his thick-
fingered hand squeezed her forearm so we did he said
yes i neglected that but i assure you my dear that all
our other arrangements will be carefully attended to

  he touched the whip to the rump of the horse and in
his throat soft laughter chuckled or was it laughter

chapter xxviii

i accuse

the dusk came early the soot of night shaded the
drab rim of overcast the air was humid the storm
winds still withheld their force

  i cant make out what happened to bearpaw swifty
ogden said he usually hits the shack at the stroke of six
we may have bigger worries right shortly said cass
hold it-well stop here till that rider passes

  they were skirting the feed-sheds of the star corrals
intending to cross at the head of wampum street the
lone rider they were watching came down the slope from
the south he pulled his mount up not far beyond them
rising in his stirrups to peer along the dim stretch of road-
way presently he swept off his hat swabbed a sleeve
across his forehead and cantered on he turned off at a
ramshackle building some fifty yards ahead

  that might be worth lookin into said cass if we
had the time what business would he have at that old
place yonder which aint been used for years from the
looks of it

  who said swifty

  gent who just rode past you see that brick-topped
scalp and the scar on his cheek when he cooled himself
last time i saw that face it popped up in the window of a
shack out at burnt mills there could be some reason
of course why one of that nester bunch should be ridin
out of the south on a well-tired hoss

  as a smarter man just said swifty drawled im
lookin for bigger worries whats keepin us

  they went by a devious route to a fenced backyard a
gate stood ajar and the rear door of the house opened be-
fore cass could thump his knuckles on it a light-skinned
negro girl closed the door behind them as madame
mustache rose from a kitchen chair

  except for my sick girl above she said and for
rachel here who can be trusted we are alone in the house
you need have no fear of a trap costello still sleeps but he
will waken soon

  as you understand he is too weak to talk a great deal
too much excitement could kill him with another cough-
ing spell a hemorrhage but that is costellos risk he
accepts it by his own decision she shrugged please
come with me

  she led them to a small room furnished in quiet taste
this is my private parlor she said please sit down i
must tell you first that costello is not to be blamed too
greatly for hiding his knowledge he is weak-willed per-
haps but not a scoundrel

  remember that in common with many others he had
no great affection for matthew mchale mchale scorned
and abused him for his drinking shamed him publicly many
times when sympathy might have helped him in the be-
ginning also costello could prove nothing

  later when his whisky-soaked brain saw a clearer pat-
tern he hoped to be able to discover the truth behind his
suspicions and to blackmail a good fat sum as an inheri-
tance for his boy

swifty ogden perched on the edge of his chair
watching her with a sort of fascination she sat in a
rocker and in the soft light of the china-shaded table lamp
her face was almost handsome

  you didnt notice that down on her lip after youd
watched her a while she was well under forty he thought
and she had a real womans shape to her her snapping
black eyes had the kind of spirit a man liked to see she
spoke in a quiet fast-moving voice that had some faint
foreign note in it

  swifty turned his look toward cass and began to feel
better cass gentry was starting to be cass gentry again
he sat ramrod straight his hands spread on his thighs and
the tilt of his chin told the story that swifty wanted to hear

  it does not matter how i wormed out costellos story
said the woman i will repeat what i learned from him in
the course of many drunken hours and he will confirm it
when he wakes it goes back to the day that matthew
mchale was murdered and robbed out near the rimrock
cut-off

  costello was drunk that day as he usually was when
he could cadge the money the handiest place he could
find to sleep it off was behind some bales of straw at the
spur stables it was in the afternoon and he was half
awakened at one time by the voices of men nearby in his
bleary way he recognized one of the talkers though he
did not overhear a single word

  early that same night long before the news of mc-
hales death had reached town costello was roaming the
alley behind the wheel of fortune nerving himself to go
in and beg a drink he saw a man dart out the back door
and hide something in a stand of barrels it was the man
whose voice wakened him at the spur

  he went wandering on and it did not occur to him until


argosy

later that what he had seen of the object this man was
hiding suggested a wallet he went back and searched
among the barrels finding nothing the wallet or what-
ever it was had been removed

  im coming to the point she said you must realize
that costellos story is not so much what he knows as what
he has reason to believe the next day costello met this
man he had seen at the spur and in the dark alley costello
had no sound reason to ask him for money but his thirst
was fierce and he took the chance

  the man refused where would i get money to pass
out to every bum in town he said why said costello
from what i overheard at the spur yesterday you were
about to inherit ten thousand dollars the man stared as
if he had seen a ghost he pushed a bill into costellos
hand and darted off

  who was this man cass asked

t will come to that she said costello of course
had meant nothing by what he said speaking of ten
thousand dollars was his idea of a joke not until a few
days later when he asked this man for money again and
got it without question did his rumsoaked brain begin to
ponder

  why should a man who never before had spared him a
civil word suddenly become a soft touch why should
mention of the spur and ten thousand dollars produce
such a miracle

  he knew of course that there was some crooked work
afoot he says however that he did not connect it with
the mchale murder until some time later this certain
man had no apparent reason for killing mchale-at any
rate costello did not think of it right away

  he kept himself happily drunk but now and then he
had a sober hour he was an able lawyer in his day and
he still could be clever occasionally he convinced his
hgndout-man that he had drawn up a document relating
the conversation he had overheard and the incident he ob-
served

  he had arranged he said for this document to be de-
livered to federal authorities in the event that he died
any other than a natural death this was a lie of course
but costello told it convincingly he put it over

  by this time costello was sure that he had his finger
in something big he knew that the man he was bleeding
was one of the lesser fry but he hoped to hit on a lead that
would carry him higher five thousand dollars was the
blackmail price he counted on-a stake for the young un

  in the meantime he did not press his demands too hard
on his handout-man he was satisfied with a ten-spot here
and there for he was convinced that his sucker was con-
cealing from his bosses the fact that costello was in the
know and so costello waited and pried a little and
added two and two-

  and what was the answer cass demanded harshly
who was it name the man

  it is costellos story she said let him accuse in
the back room-come with me



  the doctors buggy rocked through the early dark a
wheel bumped over a boulder the vehicle lurched and the
jolting sway of her body roused mary ellen dr fara-
baughs arm was the strong support that held her securely

he released the grip that banded her shoulders as she mur-
mured sleepy surprise

   i must have dozed off for twenty winks she said vague-
ly my eyes just wouldnt stay open she frowned into
the blank night where are we why wait-were off
the road

a short-cut he said put your head back my dear
and rest just a little short-cut to where were going
she smiled at him sleepily rest-so sweet the softness
of it so easy to let your body relax in the deep deep calm
of dreamless sleep



the seal of death was graven gray on duke costellos
- face the effort of his breathing beaded sweat along
his brow but his eyes were darkly alive they lifted to
cass and swifty beside the bed sardonic and rolled to-
ward the woman who was placing her lamp upon the table
is it time he whispered have you arranged-
i have arranged she said i followed your plan i
told them how you learned of the situation and how it de-
veloped shall i go on now with your conclusions

  the head moved on the pillow-yes

  costello knows that two men murdered matthew mc-
hale he could name them for you but as i have ex-
plained he could back his accusation with no real proof
later we will return to this point he believes however
that these men were the hirelings of another an unknown
and that mchales murder was the first step in a scheme to
steal the rocker properties right costello

   right he said

   some years ago she continued when costello was
acting as mchales attorney he investigated the status of
the free range the indian grant lands that mchale had
been using he outlined for mchale a scheme for the
legal control of these lands by means of homestead claims

  mchale rejected it as nonsense unnecessary soon
after his death however someone else proceeded to put the
same idea into operation

   and the will said the whisper from the bed dont
forget the will

   yes the will mchales will as filed for probate
named costello executor it was a will drawn up at least
six years ago before costello began his drinking career

   costello knows that a new will was signed later-per-
haps in plateau city-which listed the rocker assets and
included new bequests he believes this later will was de-
stroyed in order to cover up the looting of the estate he
thinks that matthew mchale was a wealthy man when
he died

  but who destroyed it cass demanded damn all
this run-around name me a name-one name

   softly she said listen

tjrom the rear came a rattling noise cass gentrys
gun flicked out and swiftys hand dropped to holster
as the rattle was repeated

  it is my rachel said madame mustache she fum-
bles the lock to warn me that her errand is completed i
sent her out mr gentry to bring the answer to your ques-
tion stand back hide yourselves along the wall

  her hands flung out dramatically her voice was an
urgent rushing whisper

costello cannot prove she breathed the single fact
gunswift



he possesses is the identity of the man who paid him hush-
money rachel will bring that man to this room it is
costellos hope that he will betray himself when publicly
accused perhaps you can force from him the truth that
evaded costellos slyness

  she turned her head listening hush-the door-here
they come

  the distant door was closed with a softly echoing thump
voices murmured from the kitchen footsteps dragged
the clack of rachels heels was an approaching signal
and beneath that sound was the scuff of a heavier tread

  across the kitchen down the dark hall drawing closer
cass gentry and swifty ogden pressed close against the
wall in the shadows that flanked the death-room door the
woman stiffly posed expectant and duke costello a live-
eyed corpse upon the bed a nearing voice mumbling

  cant afford-be seen-place like this decent thing-
a dyin man-

  this way suh said rachel yonders the light

  he has been calling your name said madame
mustache come in

  wash parsons came puffing-in



  the buggy had halted dr farabaugh had unpinned
mary ellens hat and her head-lolled back against the
seat the breath of her heavy slumber was softly audible

  the doctor climbed down he crossed a thick-grassed
clearing to the shadow blot of the cabin he fitted a key
into the padlock of the door his searching hands found a
lantern on the wall and the spread of its light revealed a
dust-filmed room plainly furnished

  dr farabaugh placed the lantern on the table he
opened his medicine kit held up a stoppered vial and
watched the contents as he shook them thoroughly from
a small compartment he lifted a needle-pointed hypodermic
plunger nodding

  he carried the lantern outside put it down on a stump
fifty feet beyond the cabin long strides moved him back
to the buggy his gentle fingers felt for the girls hand
a prick of pain a jabbing bite in her forearm roused mary
ellen she sat upright gasping



cass gentrys fingers were squeezing the fat of wash
parsons throat the mouth of the mayor of triangle
was a bloody smear and his gross body was slumped in a
corner where one of the furious blows had dropped him-
his thin-thatched head pounded the wall-angle with
each new thrust of the strangling grip that shook and bat-
tered him he glared in terror at the gun-muzzle cass
now lifted

  no he gluttered for gods sake no his thick
breath choked i never killed im dont shoot-vic
barths your man

  he lifted quivering fingers to his throat when cass re-
laxed the clamping pressure his red-webbed eyes looked
down the gullet of the colt and the whimpering wheezing
words gushed out of him

  vic killed im he panted i stopped the buckboard
on the rimrock road an vic stepped out an shot im i
swear i never knew what vic aimed to do vic sucked me
into it

  i done no moren i was told i fixed the rustlin deal
with tex cordill i carried orders to that burnt mills
crowd but i was forced i tell you vic swore hed pin
matts murder on me

  wait said madame mustache sharply what was
that noise

  i had the goods on vic wash parsons blurted thats
why he hooked me in he used me for a cats-paw that
was all except for murder-money that couldnt be passed
i swear i never got a penny

  but there was money behind your deals cass told
him grimly who put it up where did it come from
vic got it the bloody mouth blubbered he never
let me know from where he wouldnt tell me what was
goin on- his voice lifted to a sudden bleat as the sun-
sight stabbed his cheek dont-dont kill ne now ill
tell you what i know i follered vic one night when ready
cash was needed-

  rachel the woman called harshjy what are you
doing out there she turned the key that had locked
wash parsons in opened the door to the dim hallway

  i follered vic the fat man wheezed an he never
knew it he taken a wide circle out tord hill street he
come up behind a big house there an sneaked in the stables
he took a wad of bills that had been hid for him beneath
a carriage cushion this was up at eli lomb- 

  the woman screamed she screamed as roars of ex-
plosion hammered into the room vic barths shoulder
slammed the door wide open and he came charging through
with both guns shooting

chapter xxix

 the dread gun

tlfary ellen lay upon a blanket-spread bunk in the
cabin where the doctor had carried her by muster-
ing all her concentration every ounce of effort she pos-
sessed she could keep her eyes from closing completely

  this fringed slit of vision was the chief importance of
her life if she allowed her lids to meet even for an in-
stant the whirlpool coma would swallow her again her
body was powerless she had no strength no force of will
her sole weapon against the stupor the paralysis was
one small bright spark which glowed in her brain and
fought the tides of darkness that would sweep her under

  a candle burned in the cup upon the table dr fara-
baughs shadow moved across the wavering radiance and he
sat once more in the chair beside her he leaned to test
her pulse to smile his bearded smile close to her face

  still fighting against it eh he said softly you are
strong my dear you have strong young life in you and
i will teach you how to use it we will rear the tall sons
she denied me

  his hand stroked her arm

  so now you know he said i would have saved it for
the morning but it may be as well for your mind to digest
it while you sleep we are not bound for jane morgans
ellie my child we are traveling wider you and i god
knows where our journey will end but triangle will be
far behind forgotten when your few little days of sleep
have passed

  some day you will thank me for it he said i will
show you happiness my dear and a love you would never
have known what could a puppy like martin burdette


argosy

give you you were made for a man ellie-for a mans
passion and tenderness and understanding

  the chair creaked with his shifting weight mary ellen
heard his words from a droning distance she saw him as
a giant loom of shadow faceless and shapeless

iithey will talk of us in triangle for twenty years he
said we will be scandal a great romance i left
a letter of my own behind you see to explain that little
note in your handwriting

  our love couldnt wait for propriety i told them or
sham respect for the dead the town will be shocked but
they will also understand everything has been carefully
arranged a friend of mine will soon be here with the
horses we will need he will lead us to a safe and quiet
place dont be afraid my dear i will be gentle i would
never harm you

  his fingers smoothly brushing pushed the hair back
from her forehead his hand felt the beat of her heart

  you will sleep soon he said there was too much
sleep in my needle to be resisted many minutes more
relax-

   nbut that one little spark of strength would not extinguish
it was desperate hope her last resource it was a tiny flame
of memory an instant of reality that her weakness could
still grasp

  in the dark buggy waking to a bite of pain she had
struggled briefly against his strength she had felt the
deeper jab of his hypodermic then but there had also been
a flow of moisture down her arm she was able to with-
stand the drowsy surges now only because she had escaped
the full effect of the narcotic

  you do not know that you love me he said would
you believe that until a few brief weeks ago i did not realize
my own feelings for you it needed ada to discover the
truth

  her sharp eyes saw how we looked at each other how
your hand sought the touch of my hand how you came in-
stinctively to my arms in trouble and danger i laughed
when she first accused me but then i began to see-

  he spoke in monotone he was staring down at her
face but his words were addressed to the wall to the
silence to the dark spirit within himself he was easing
the strain of his days and nights of turmoil

  that was why ada hated you he said your youth
your beauty-yes they taunted her she turned her ugly
spite against us both

  you remember the threatening letters ada wrote
them planted them at her own door she admitted it to me
laughing-defied me to expose it and then of course she
tried to kill you when i would not send you away

  his voice was part of a horrid dream mary ellen was
dreaming it was a roaring wind in her brain that was
fanning that small spark of sanity brighter and brighter
she could feel a stir along her body a flex of wakening
muscles there were beads of perspiration ridged on her
lip she could close her eyes now and know she had the
power to open them

  she was a crafty woman ada was he said she knew
how to hate how to be cruel she blamed me for the ac-
cident that caused her injury you see confining herself
to a chair when she might have walked if she wanted to
was her punishment of me

  she could hobble well enough to go out to the stables
that evening and shoot a bullet that missed your face by

an inch as you talked with gentry she thought having
heard the buggy that you were meeting me in a lovers
rendezvous i realized then that she would kill you unless
i prevented it that was why i murdered her

  he stood abruptly his chair toppled he flung out one
big hand fingers clawed yes damn you he said harshly
i killed you as i should have done before i planned it
years ago-to hide the buggy at the edge of town to creep
the alleys to silence your harpys tongue in the smother of
your pillow

  i waited six years too long your damned ambitions
your complaints your nag nag nag for money money
more money you pushed me into that devils deal with
milo shand-	

  there was a plunk upon the roof a stone bounced and
rattled down dr farabaugh whipped up the tail of his
coat pawing for the revolver at his hip then straightened as
a faint whistle sounded he went to the door

  its just us chickens doc hailed a voice from the
night

 hold it a second the doctor called be right with
you ollie



tn the gray house of madame mustache in the small
room where duke costello lay dying where wash par-
sons bleated his confession the guns crashed and the bullets
slammed and the frenzied shadows on the wall wove the
pattern of destiny

  vic barth sprang through the doorway he had a gun in
either fist-guns that spouted and boomed as he lurched
ahead his arms pumped and the bullets blasted

  a chance remark had led him here a wink and a grin
and a passing reference to the dusky messenger who had
buzzed wash parsons ear-it was enough to send the lean-
faced deputy prowling the copper-skinned maid huddled
senseless near the kitchen door was a milestone on the
trail he had followed he had overheard the blurted words
creeping down the hall

  he was a murder-machine loosed upon the room already
the gallows noose was looping his neck and his sole escape
was this road of desperation if he could silence that blub-
bering mouth if his first attack could settle cass gentry-
his shots slammed into the dangerous corner he fired
again at the rooms boil of motion

  the woman had been staggered by the inward thrust of
the door she was lurching milling her long arms trying
to reach the bedside table to crash the lamp duke costello
was a deaths-head doll jerked up to sitting posture and
jerked again in a sidewise fall to the floor swifty ogden
was bringing up his pistol shouting and cass gentry-
cass gentry was down he had stumbled forward against
the wall with the first hammer of explosions from the door-
way trapped in a cramping angle hampered by the frantic
clutch wash parsons fastened on his gun-wrist he could
do no more than fling himself in a wild sprawl of escape
from the swift assault that caught him with his back turned

  a slug slapped close to his head as he wrenched his hand
free but he was twisting instantly to face the door to point
his colt by blind instinct to trigger it

tte fired into the teeth of vic barths second brace of
--- shots the triple detonation rocked the room blos-
somed a smoky haze into which cass drove three bullets
gunswift



  swiftys pistol spoke and barths weapons whammed a
third discharge but the dark deputy was a dead man
shooting his pumping arms were faltering and the loads
of those final cartridges slapped only dust and splinters
from the floor

   vic barth was still lunging on but the upper half of his
body moved too fast for his limber legs he dropped his
guns and his hands hugged agony to his breast as he fell
he toppled forward and his head lolled limp upon a little
plaited rug

  a hvsh chased the echoes from the room in the fading
gunsmoke fog the bitter powder fumes the single sound
was a gasping breath a gurgle cass let his gunhand fall
and his eyes went across the room to swifty ogden he
pushed himself up and his head turned to see what swifty
saw

  it was the droop-headed bulk of wash parsons the
mayor of triangle sagged in his penitents corner his last
confession squeezed out of him one of vic barths bullets
had loosed his despairing grip as he struggled with cass
the wound was an ugly gape high on the fat mans temple

  costellos was the strident breath the gurgle they
lifted him from the floor a skin-and-bones scarecrow

  the doctor said the woman hurry-bring some-
one-

  cass and swifty went together they ran past the big
main parlor and cass unlocked the front door with a heave
of his shoulder that cracked the wood and shattered glass
the uproar of gunfire should bring scurrying figures all
along the street he thought but as he sprang across the
porch clattered down the steps there were no voices lifting

  cut across and find farabaugh he yelled to swifty
ill hunt abel bannister i

  what he would say to bannister what words he would
find to convince that bull-necked man-no that problem
was beyond him now

  but somehow cass knew he could manage it he would
make that snaketrack hard-head see the picture cass
gentry now could see if he had to lick ten squads of
vigilantes to do it

  it was a vague picture-there were blind spots in it-but
wash parsons had disclosed the door to the central mystery

feeble scattered lights along the empty thoroughfare he
knew the answer he knew what had happened before he
barged in at the nearest doorway of light the elk hotel
and saw the group of older men and derby-hatted drummers
who sat uncomfortably beneath the center light the dull
sensation in the pit of his stomach deepened with every
twang of the hotel clerks voice 

  bannister said the clerk why tonights the night
man the orders passed at sundown to close the town
while the posse was gone women and youngsters are to
stay indoors until the menfolks ride home and it was
made plain that it wouldnt be healthy for any man to
roam the streets in the meantime

  cass muttered another question

  whered he go the clerk cackled theres a thirty-
mile stretch of badlands around the devils pocket and
abe bannisters the one man who could say where theyll
head into it

  cass stood on the walk outside he turned his head
slowly staring blankly along the lonely thoroughfare the
sound of his name hoarsdy shouted moved him on toward
council street swifty ogden was coming on the run

  cass swifty panted shes gone-mary ellens
gone

  cass grabbed him fiercely

  shes gone i tell you swifty puffed the docs
gone too some neighbors found bearpaw out in the stable
-been hit across the head he never saw who hit im he
aint got the least idea where theyd want to go or why
the carriage pulled out the neighbors tell just around
dark

  doc was drivin mary ellen they say her rooms been
cleaned out and her luggage is gone the ony thing at all
thats known is that the doc paid a boy to carry a letter to
henry gaunt

  gone cass muttered

  and henry gaunt cant be found said swifty his
house and office are- both locked tight his voice rose
sharply he pushed at cass twisting away leggo he
cried cass youll break my arm  

chapter xxx

cass loped along the middle of the road the night
had inherited the dour aspects of the day the over-
cast had blanketed the stars and the air had a muggy taint
division street was sparsely housed but even so it was
strange that no one had roused to the shooting it was
curious too to see such a stretch of darkened windows at
such an early hour

  when he came to wampum street when he saw the

escape without hope

mary ellen moved her hand she stretched the
fingers knotted them iffco a fist the effort of lifting
her head required all her energy but at length she managed
it she let her body relax then breathing out a sigh 
slowly slowly she could feel the warm ooze of returning
strength that was chasing the listless sleep out of her body

happy relief from
            painful backache

  many of those gnawing nagging painful backaches peo-
ple blame on colds or strains are often caused by tired kid-
neys-and may be relieved when treated in the right way

  the kidneys are natures chief way of taking excess
acids and poisonous waste out of the blood they help
most people pass about  pints a day

  if the  miles of kidney tubes and filters dont work
well poisonous waste matter stays in the blood these
poisons may start nagging backaches rheumatic pains loss

of pep and energy getting up nights swelling puffiness
under the eyes headaches and dizziness frequent or
scanty passages with smarting and burning sometimes
shows there is something wrong with your kidneys or
bladder

 dont wait ask your druggist for doans pills used
successfully by millions for over  years they give
happy relief and will help the  miles of kidney tubes
flush out poisonous waste from the blood get doans pills

she kept her eyes half lidded to hide the bright awareness
with which she watched the cabin door

  how much longer how many minutes more would
they give her to fight the waning effects of the drug the
cloudy drink she had accepted so innocently in dr fara-
baughs office how much vitality could she coax back
into herself before they returned

  the lethargy still held her she knew that time must
pass before she would be able to roll herself from the bunk
to crawl but if they gave her half an hour

  they were coming now she eased her body limply
she closed her eyes and subdued her breath to soft regular-
ity she must be sly there must be no false starts no
fumbling attempts

  the voices approached the door the newcomer spoke
in a pleasant drawl a young voice ollie- was that the
name the doctor called was there any other ollie but
ollie shand

  i just thought id mention the lay of the land he was
saying i been scoutin around in there doc and i watched
the work they done they got the ambush set some three-
four miles this side of the notch

   its a place we used to call the cattail cut and i see em
fixin shields of brush to hide behind and diggin out the
roll-down boulders how many men you says with ban-
nister a hunnerd odd lord if they ony wait for half
of em to get inside the cut before they crack loose-why
even then itll be a massacre

   its no affair of oyrs the doctor said

  it is of mine said shand in a way it is i swore
id never go back to the pocket that night i cut down my
dad and buried im there i never gave a damn when that
new crowd moved in and started the kind of thievery that
mustve rolled my daddy over in his grave

  for a while doc i was pleased with the talk which
passed around and named me as the boss of the pocket still
but these damn buzzards have carried it too far what
hellishness have they got afoot in the days when the
shands picked up the little bunches of dogies that you
spotted for us doe wed ride ten miles to keep from killin
a man

  the doctor mumbled he opened the cabin door peered
in at mary ellen she lay still as death and he closed the
door gently

  a nother thing said ollie shand is that one of

   the boys that worked for us is suckin bannister in
red helwig that scar-face son of a skunk for five
hundred dollars so i hear reds agreed to show bannisters
bunch a way into the pocket

   he claims theres ai trail that neednt run them through
the notch which there aint doc hell lead em into cat-
tail cut thats all and men will have their heads blowed
off before they know it

  but our heads will stay put ollie the doctor said
thats the big thing boy what do you owe bannister
some of the men behind him are men who rode on that
other devils pocket raid

  i didnt think id hear you talk that way said shand
you been drinkin doc or what you sound like youd
taken to shootin that stuff in your arm agin the halfway
reason i told all this was that you might want me to show
you the short-cut trail that can head bannister off i
couldnt stop him myself but you could handle it you and
your friend aint in that big a hurry i reckon

   but we are ollie the doctor said harshly thats why
i asked you to bring the horses here thats why i need
you to lead us through the roughs i expect to be miles
deep in montana before morning you know the old cabin
your father used-the one of rocky ridge thats where
i want you to take us i know the trails on the other side
i can handle it from there

  shand whistled whats wrong doc whos trompin
on your tail

   the devil  dr farabaugh muttered my friend is a
woman ollie ive got to get her away shes sick-ill
have to carry her-but she can stand the ride bring up
your horses and lets get out of here



ass gentry pushed into the wheel of fortune less
than half of the usual lamps were burning here and
the big room was almost lifeless the wheels were covered
the tables deserted the handful of men huddled at the end
of the far of companionship speaking softly these were
the employees of the place the cardmen and stickmen the
lookouts

   only the riffraff in triangle town tonight cass thought
the tinhorns the outcasts of respectability the wolf-breed-
fellows like mr cass gentry

   he stood briefly inside the door vaguely staring then
turned and went out again swifty ogden was waiting on
the walk and they paced slowly

   the trouble is cass said gruffly that i dont know
what to do i dont know where to turn theres nothin
i can put my hands on swifty

   swifty did not speak

   and i think of what might happened said cass i
think of-hell i dunno who knocked bearpaw on the
head why would she leave without a word to me it
might not even been doc farabaugh with her for all we
can tell

   swifty shook his- head

   i got to do one thing or another cass said his voice
was shaky ill drive myself loco just walkin here i
never felt like this before i-well i-

sure said swifty you love her thats the hell of it



the cabin flooring creaked beneath the doctors tread
-- he bent beside the bunk watching mary ellens face
in the candlelight

   this was the crisis she must play the corpse every
muscle limp she must control her breathing she must pot
flinch

   she felt his breath upon her cheek his fingers sought
her wrist-and could she hide the tremor of her heart

   he straightened safe-play it safe he muttered
theres no road back

  mary ellen knew what he meant there was no road
back from rocky ridge no return for either of them the
shame they would share would build a barrier around tri-
angle town his secret would be locked behind the doors
of her disgrace

   and her instinct knew another meaning his words when
dr george farabaugh thrust the face of his crippled ada
into her pillow venting the impulses that the years had
bred he had forced an inevitable chain of events
gunswift



   he was not cruel not a criminal none of his thoughts
 or actions were abnormal he was still the calm and kindly
 man in whom mary ellen had sensed honest sympathy and
 understanding protection against her fears

   but he had chosen murder as the strong medicine to cure
 his ills and the fever aftermath was a ravage beyond his
 control his will his nerves could not endure the strain
 of his guilt this was his sole insanity

   she could understand the tension that racked him from
 the night of death to the morning of the funeral he must
 have known that his safety depended upon a dulling passage
 of time if he could maintain his saddened pose for a month
 three months   

   a cold-blooded killer could have managed it dr george
 farabaugh could not in the logic of his turmoil he had
 seen the risk of flight as the lesser evil perhaps he had con-
 vinced himself seeing them in the distortion of adas savage
 eyes that mary ellens thoughtless affections had been
 tokens of a love for him perhaps his harried imaginings
 could see a future that mary ellen might share he had
 blinded himself to all impossibilities for murder had set his
 foot upon the road without turning

   this knowledge was a dull sense she possessed she knew
 it in the same way that she recognized her peril with the
 same finality which recognized that death death by her
 own hand would be her escape from rocky ridge

 she could follow the sounds of the doctors movements
 he was at the table the snap of his little bag the
 glassy tinkle had her pulse betrayed the shamming was
 he filling another hypodermic with cloudy sleep she did
 not dare to move her head to risk a lidded glance

   the cabin door whined dr farabaughs foot scraped
 the floor his breath hissed an exclamation the doorway
 sounded to a hesitant step a jingle of spur

   i dont like it doc said ollie shand i dunno just
 what it is but this deal here smells wrong what in hell
 goes on doc

   the doctors strides moved swiftly over the floor

   you tend to the horses ollie ill bring her out in just
 a minute

  not so fast said shand what stuff was that you
 shook in the bottle who you usin that dingus on-her or
 you who is this woman friend and what is it that ails
 her i figger thats the least i ought to know

   - your father trusted me the doctor said i didnt
 think id have to explain myself to the shands i saved
 your life one time boy is a little favor a few hours help
 too much to ask since when did you go high and mighty
 mary ellen saw them in lash-dimmed outline the bulk
 of the doctors shoulders partially hid the slighter figure

ollie shand had advanced into the room was edging in the
direction of the bunk against the wall

  i never claimed to be no bettern i am he said its
the woman part of this that i got no hankerin for i trust
you good enough doc id ride the river for you too i
reckon though i ought to have a look at her any good
reason i shouldnt

  why no the doctor said slowly he moved aside

   mary ellen let her lashes fall her breath was tremulous
waiting there was life in her hands her arms but not
enough not quite enough she felt ollie shand beside her
leaning to peer in the candleglow he was turning swiftly
then

  hell doc this is matt mchales girl

  yes ollie-and mary ellen heard the menace in his
soft voice if ollie shand didnt-the daughter of the man
who noosed the shands on a gallons tree does that make
it different

  it makes it crazier said ollie shand whats eatin
at you doc you know i wouldnt touch her theres
enough who aready think i killed old matt

  yes said the doctor thats why i didnt want you to
know i thought you might feel that way but i wont
press you ollie i-perhaps i can find my own way if
youll dispose of the buggy for me loose my nag on the
main road-

  mary ellen slitted her eyes ollie shand stood close to
the bunk darkening her face with his shadow dr fara-
baugh was moving toward the table falking smoothly but
mary ellen knew he was talking lies he had dipped his
hands in murder once and murder cannot stop halfway
if ollie shand was not a friend he became a foe he knew
too much to be left behind

  and dr farabaugh would play it safe he would talk
soft dissemble until he was ready to act he would draw
close to ollie shand smiling and then he would spring
his giants hands-so swift so strongly gentle-would
fasten their grip on the smaller man and no gun in holster
could parry them

  mary ellen turned her head an inch she saw the black
crook of ollie shands gun-butt so close above her hand
moved her hand lifted and ollie shands back concealed
the pounce of it her fingers sped and grabbed and jerked-

  and she had it she had the gun she was twisted on her
side her free hand pushed against the inner wall and her
elbow propped against her body and the muzzle pointed
straight as bearpaw had taught with the butt firm against
her palm and her finger tense upon the trigger

  and she had a shaking voice that cried dont move
dont move dont move

horses for the cavalry

in all the old west theres only one who can have his feet where his
head ought to be and still win hands down its the kid send him out
with a stallion to deliver and he comes back with a load of scalps
threaten him with a sioux and he turns up with stew

the thirty horses strung out in single file and
walked at a fast pace trailing them by ten feet
was a huge pinto stallion with a black head and a
mean eye

  he wore a rope hackamore and from it a rope strung to
and tied around his right front foot that held his head
down and kept him from running

  ten feet behind the stallion ben egan sat a stubby
black horse with the reins loose on his neek

  beside ben the kid rode a bay pony his chubby face
was rapturously alight this-going out and buying horses
for tookers cavalry-was part of the high adventure he
had come west to seek

  the holster flap of the elaborately carved pistol that
swung by the kids side was buttoned back they were
near indian country and there was nothing like being
ready

 suddenly the stallion holding his head low and run-
 ning with a hopping little gait ran ahead into the horses
 he reared and sank his teeth into the neck of a little
 black mare the mare squealed and fell out of line

 pivoting the stallion singled out another mare ben dug
 his heels into the sides of his horse and rode forward his
 rope swinging the end of the rope hissed about the stal-
 lions flanks

 he kicked laid his ears back and snorted then he re-
 sumed his place in the rear the kid watched

 whyd he do that ben he asked

 ben shrugged he run on timlys ranch for many a
 year he was head boss of eleven of the mares we got
 here we buy the bunch from timly an they get a new
 boss the stallion dont like it

 what would he do if you let him go

 reckon hed cut his eleven out of the bunch an cut
 back to timlys hes a trouble maker law lummy i
 dont blame him but hell make an officers mount

 	shouldnt be surprised but what we can sell him for fifty
 sixty dollars

 are all stallions like that the kid pursued

horses for the cavalry



   some is an some aint ben said hosses is a lot like
 people an you dont find no twe of em in the same pattern
 that big stallion just happens to have it on his mind that
 hes gonna get them mares of hisn back an i reckon he
 wouldnt bother much about no others

   suppose he got away the kid asked

   -id have to go back an get him

 tor a few moments he rode soberly along the thirty
 horses had cost him three hundred dollars the cavalry
 would take them off his hands for an average of thirty
 dollars apiece

   that would give him six hundred profit and the money
 could be laid aside to apply on the ranch that beckoned in
 the distant future

   ben had always wanted a ranch now that he was be-
 yond the spring chicken age he thought it high time to
 start getting one

   the cavalry wanted at least five hundred horses but the
 three hundred dollars hed paid for the thirty was all the
 money he had been able to get most of it had been bor-
 rowed from the officers mess at the army camp

    it wasnt a particularly difficult job to drive thirty horses
 the hundred miles from timlys ranch to the army camp
 the hitch was the kid

 	the kid had read too many books about the romantic
 west and even after being in the west a year still believed
 implicitly everything he had read green as new grass
 and scarcely dry behind the ears he was gifted chiefly with
 an amazing aptitude for bungling everything he tried

   in his year in the west he had had more hairbreadth
 escapes than most frontiersmen experienced in a lifetime
 only by amazing luck had he managed to keep his scalp

    as usual the kid had invitti himself on the horse-buying
 expedition riding up to bens camp the first night out he
 had attached himself firmly to ben and was as hard to get
 rid of as a case of boils

   ben sighed there had been no trouble yet but it just
 wasnt possible to ride out with the kid and not have some

   for an hour they rode the kid with exaggerated cau-
 tion inspected every bush animal track and other obvious
 sign they passed ben watched him amusedly

    but at the same time he was a little worried the cavalry
 mens rifles and sabers had supposedly tamed the sioux
 but ben knew that they were tame only when they were
 in range of the rifles or in reach of the sabers

 a crushed weed beside the trail told ben that in-
 dians were near or lately had been near he looked
 at the weed and the sign around it as he rode by

   five ponies had passed not more than two hours ago
 they had been traveling at a fast trot and could have been
 ridden by none but indians casually ben rode on

   if the kid-who fancied himself a mighty indian hunter
 -knew they had cut a sioux trail he would probably go off
 hunting them

    two miles farther on ben stopped in a grassy little glade
 the kid looked at him puzzled the sun was still four
 hours high they should be traveling ben put his hand to
 his mouth to stifle a forced yawn	i

   im tired he announced we aint gonna make it into
 the army camp afore tomorrow anyhow spose we camp
 here tonight an go on in the mornin 

   why-i guess thats all right the kid agreed

   the horses crowded into the glade and began to crop at

the long grass all of them contented but the pinto

   standing at the edge of the glade the pinto stallion
watched the men while he pretended to eat bens rope
hissed out settled about his neck he drew the squealing
horse to him and shortened the check rope about his front
foot

the kid stripped the saddles from the saddle mounts
and turned them in with the herd ben picked up his rifle

you watch the hosses he told the kid ill amble
down an around to see if i can pick up some camp meat

   ioux traveled for a lot of reasons all of which had
some kind of devilment behind them before he went
on ben had to know what the five who had crossed the trail
were up to

  it was only twenty miles to the army post but five
sioux wouldnt need even two miles to ambush and kill two
white men and run their horses off

   ben didnt like it at all if the five had not gone to so
much trouble to hide their trail there would not have been
so much cause for worry

   leaving the kid and the horses so near where they had
cut the trail was good strategy if the five had designs on
the horses they would probably circle ten or twelve miles
ahead and attemptan ambush

   if ben had told the kid to go on he would stand a good
chance of running squarely into it this way while not
entirely devoid of peril contained less than any other
method

   ben picked up the trail where the five ponies had crossed
and carefully followed it for an hour he walked over
rugged little ridges and up ravines always the trail went
west

   ben began to breathe easier apparently the indians did
not know that he and the kid were in the country

   he could go back get the kid and make an all night
ride that would put him close enough to the army camp
so that they should make it in the morning without any
trouble

   then ben came out of a ravine into a little mountain
meadow where a herd of horses had grazed he studied
the sign

   the five sioux he saw were a raiding party out to get
what horses they could

   they had gathered at least thirty from various places
probably isolated settlers some of whose homes undoubtedly
lay in ashes now with their inhabitants slaughtered and
had left the main herd here while they reconnoitered east-
ward

   ben recalled that there had been a small ranch there
whose owner had left a month ago not knowing this the
sioux had hoped to add such horses as he might have to
those already plundered failing to find any they had
come back

   ben followed the trail long enough to make sure that
they were traveling west and to fix the trails location in
his mind so a punitive expedition of cavalry could follow
and started back to where he had left the kid

tte was still a hundred yards from the glade when he
saw that there were no horses in it his rifle ready
he crept forward there was no sign of the kid

   ben felt a cold fury as he visualized his bloody and mal-
treated corpse lying somewhere among the trees a hard
anger flared in his mind if the sioux had got the kid-


argosy

 ben rose to his feet and called softly

 kid

 there was no answer ben called again a little louder
 kid

 something stirred under the bole of a fallen pine a few
 feet to his right he jumped behind a tree and trained his
 rifle on the pine

 dimly he made out a reclining form there an almost in-
 audible groan was wrenched from him it was the kid

 ben walked forward

 he leaned down grabbed the kids shoulder and
 shouted in his ear

 kid

 the kid sat up blinking stupidly his hand dove toward
 his gun he stopped and smiled sheepishly

 oh its you ben i thought twas indians

 yeh its me ben said dryly you have a good
 snooze

 oh quite good the kid stifled a yawn it was cool
 under the tree and i didnt think anything would happen
 nothin did ben said grimly except that while you
 slept the sioux come up an run your bosses off good thing
 you dont snore

 what

 the kid jerked erect and looked towards the glade an
 air of comical amazement settled over his features he
 spread his hands appealingly

 gee im sorry ben honestfl never would of thought
 any injuns would come or i would of stood them off gosh
 ben im sorry i lost your hosses

 forget it ben said

 tte went out into the glade examined the ground

     the horses had been run off by the same five sioux
 he had trailed

 they hadnt known that he and the kid were bringing
 the herd through but by some lucky chance had wandered
 east again and bumped right into the glade

 in a hurry to get the horses off they hadnt looked for
 the herder and that was the kids good luck

 wonderingly ben looked back at the kid probably the
 only person in the world who had ever slept within thirty
 feet of a band of sioux that were running off his horses

 he shook his head the kid didnt carry any rabbits
 foot but he was certainly blessed with a lot of luck

 then his relief at finding the kid safe gave way to
 piercing anger he had borrowed the money to pay for
 those horses he would have to pay it back the kid his
 face miserable with contrition and sympathy joined him

 gosh ben he wailed again i didnt know they was
 cornin im awful sorry i let them take your hosses

 it want your fault ben said

 what are you goin to do ben

 there aint no five or five hundred sioux in this blasted
 country can take my hosses an stay happy ben egan
 growled im goinafterem

 happy expectation drove some of the misery from the
 kids face

 when do we start

 i said i was goin

 aw gee ben suppose they get you suppose you need
 me aint we always hunted together please ben

 ben pondered if he ordered the kid on to the army post
 he wouldnt go or if he did go he would come out again
 and go hunting sioux on his own account

  if ben took him there locked him up and came alone
to get the horses the kid would surely follow the minute
he got out and the lost time would afford the sioux ample
opportunity to get the stolen horses to a place where they
never would be found

  since the kid would wander into the hills anyway he
was as safe where ben could keep an eye on him as he would
be any other place besides the kid had had miraculous
luck more than once before and might have it again

  come on ben said were travelin

rfhe sioux ben knew would run the horses as far as
they could in order to draw away from any pursuit
they would then rest until the horses were able to travel
again and go on

  probably they would stop at their own village long
enough to be acclaimed mighty horse stealers finally they
would trade the herd with some tribe farther west receiv-
ing in return horses that had been stolen far away from their
own grounds

  knowing that they would be eager to get away ben took
no unusual precautions as he alternately walked and trotted
along the trail

  a half hour after he and the kid left the glade night fell
and they came to where his horses had joined the rest of
the stolen herd

  after another half hour ben stopped short in his tracks
as a horse whinnied motioning the kid to silence he
stepped into the shelter of the trees the sioux should be
farther than this but maybe they werent

  the horse whinnied again and there was a great splash-
ing of water and clattering of stones as he crossed a little
creek not far ahead followed by the kid ben ventured
back to the trail

  if an indian was riding that horse he wouldnt be making
so much noise ben saw the animal head low and riderless
limping down the trail waited until he was abreast and
leaped at his head

  the horse tried to shy away but ben caught the hacka-
more

  it was the pinto stallion the check rope still on his
front foot he had not been able to keep up with the rest and
had been left behind rather than risk losing even the mo-
ment it might have taken to cut him loose

  ben reached down to cut the rope on his foot the pinto
jerked his head up his knee was chafed and raw where
the rope had rubbed but otherwise he was unhurt

  ben brought the rope over his neck and tied it on the
other side of the hackamore to form a rein the stallion
plunged backward and reared ben pulled him to the
ground and mounted him

  for a moment the stallion pitched wildly then stopped
bucking and responded to the pull of the rope on either
side ben slid from his back keeping the rope over his arm

  hes wild but broke to ride he said thoughtfully
kid can you follow this trail

  easy the kid boasted with the air of one who likes
nothing better than following trails at night

  we got one hoss but theys two men ben said that
aint enough hosses but itll help well ride an tie ill
ride him ten minutes up the trail youll find him tied to
a tree then you ride ten minutes an tie for me

  but for petes sake kid dont lose hold of this hoss or
hell be gone kin you remember to keep a tight hold on
him
horses for the cavalry

s

i can hold any horse the kid said confidently

 his face was eager and excited-and fearless

 ten sprang to the stallions back and put him to a swift
 trot up the trail ten minutes later he dismounted tied
 the pinto to a tree and continued on foot a little farther
 op the kid who had reached and mounted the stallion
 cantered past him

 ben breathed a sigh of relief if the kid had handled
 the horse once he could do it again

 most of the night alternately riding tying the horse for
 the one coming on foot and walking they continued then
 ben who was riding overtook the kid on the trail and slid
 from the pintos back

 wait a minute he said

 whats the matter the kid demanded

 injuns up thar

 gee is there ben

 ben was sniffing the breeze down which very faintly
 but undeniably present was wafted the odor of wood smoke
 the sioux had stopped their stolen horse herd not far
 ahead how far was a matter of conjecture

 ben swung from the trail he led the horse and the kid
 a quarter of a mile into the woods and stopped

 which way is east he asked the kid

 for a second the kid studied the sky hopefully while
 ben cynically regarded his astronomical observations the
 kid flung an arm out

 that way

 thas right ben agreed but dont depend on the
 stars wait right here for the sun in the mornin dont
 for no reason leve go of that hoss if i aint back by sun-
 up ride east like hell

 the first big crick you come to will be bowler river
 follow that upstream an you cant miss the cavalry camp
 tell tooker that if hell send a detail into gandoo pass
 hell be able to ketch five sioux with a herd of stolen bosses

 got it set your course by the sun

 what you aim to do the kid asked

 im gonna look these hellions over mebbe theys a way
 we might get the hosses back ourselves if there is ill be
 back here before sun-up if there aint ill follow them
 heathen devils while you ride

 that hoss is fast all you got to do is ride east to
 bowler river my life may depend on it is that clear

 yeah the kid said his eyes dancing

 im dependin on you ben warned dont let that
 hoss go an get the cavalry into gandoo pass

 like a drifting shadow ben melted into the woods swift-
 ly he trotted toward where he supposed the indian camp to
 be he came to the top of a hill and lookeddown into a
 dark valley

 suddenly through the darkness came a few high-pitched
 squeals and snorts as a couple of the stallions among the
 herd fought over a mare or some grass

 ben sank to his belly and wormed his way towards a
 stump that was faintly outlined ahead

 a sioux brave rose up from behind the stump a war
 club smacked against the side of bens head he fell face
 down

 the first thing ben became conscious of was that he
 was tied he lay on his side with rawhide thongs
 drawn so tightly over his wrists and about the calves of his
 legs that the flesh on either side stood out in great ridges

  he looked down at his hands tied in front of him and
raised thema little when he tried to move his body he
could only wriggle back and forth

  the next thing he became aware of was the horse herd

  he lay in the bottom of a valley looking up on a side
hill the horses about sixty of them grazed in a little
natural meadow about a hundred and fifty feet from the
edge of the forest

  then a big sioux naked except for a breech cloth and a
string of grizzly claws about his neck padded up from
somewhere to stand over him the sioux drew his foot back
and kicked ben hard in the ribs

  ben tried not to flinch but could not control the agony
that shot through his chest and he knew must show on
his face

  expressionless the sioux stood over him a moment ben
studied his face his armshis body and every distinguishing
mark about him if he got out of this he would know that
particular indian when he saw him again

  there was not he admitted candidly much chance of
getting out the ground beneath him was grassy and soft
even if he could roll over there was no outjutting rock or
hard substance against which he might saw the rawhide
bonds in two

  the sioux would prevent any such attempt to escape
anyway

  ben tried not to think of the method the indians would
choose to kill him burning skinning alive disemboweling
staking on ant hills-the sioux knew them all

  of course there was always the chance that they would
take him prisoner to their village so everybody could be in
on the fun if not that the torture would not be too drawn
out because they would be anxious to get their stolen horses
on the move

tte heard the indians moving behind him and also
the stamping of the riding horses they had tethered
there for a moment he gave way to an overwhelming dis-
gust

  he ben egan had let himself be caught easy as the
greenest tenderfoot still that was the way these things
went one slip was one too many

  but these indians were in dangerous country and they
must know it if they tried to ride out any way except
through the gandoo pass they must go through settled
country where they would have to fight their way and
tookers cavalry would be waiting for them in the pass

  he knew that he could trust the kid to take the news to
tooker the kid would seize any excuse for a wild ride
if the sioux decided to take him through to their village he
would be rescued by the cavalry

  suddenly he was seized from behind by the hair and
the ears and jerked to a sitting position

  the sioux he saw had raised no tepee and hadnt even
used blankets but had merely lain on the ground about a
fire the fire was blazing now and the hilts of two cavalry
sabers protruded from it

  laying his rifle on the ground one of the indians stopped
to seize a saber by the handle and wave it aloft their rifles
in their hands the other four turned around

  ben spat at them

  one got up to walk over and rip bens clothes from him
he placed a foot against bens chest and pushed him back
to the ground

  ben closed his eyes they were going to disembowel him


argosy

with a red hot saber if he screamed he would make it as
loud as possible they might kill him quickly rather than
risk attracting attention

  again he thought of the cavalry it would take the kid
not more than six hours to reach the camp the sun was
two hours high so he must be two hours on his way by
now

  gandoo pass was only about seven hours from the army
camp but driving the horses ahead of them the sioux
couldnt make it in less than eleven or twelve from here

  no doubt in addition to sending a detail to the pass
tooker would send another here to take the trail on the
one chance in ten that the sioux were not stopped in the
pass they would certainly be overtaken

  and when the cavalry seeing what they had done to ben
egan caught them   

  ben smiled grimly

  his thoughts returned to the kid and he sighed in-
audibly he had cussed the kid and damned his blundering
a hundred different times but there was something about
him something that touched ben in a way no other human
being ever had

  he was under no illusions concerning himself knew that
he was just an ordinary hard-bitten frontiersman but to
the kid he had been a dashing hero

  he smiled the kid was like an overgrown puppy that
cant do anything right but at which nobody can stay
angry

  he hoped the kid would come here some day maybe
even put a marker over the place where he had died and
tell his grandchildren how he and ben egan had whipped
the entire sioux nation without any help at all

  the kid was like that he-

  the sioux who had laid his rifle on the ground rose up
again the saber about the hilt of which he had wrapped
green buckskin glowed with a white heat

  then from the hill where the horse herd grazed rolled
the high-pitched angry challenge of a fighting stallion

tien opened his eyes and looked toward the herd he
- gasped the pinto stallion stood at the edge of the
forest he had gotten away from the kid ben swore

  lowering his head the stallion charged into the herd
for forty seconds they milled about driving his eleven
mares ahead of him the pinto thundered back into the
forest

  the sioux who held the saber dropped it and leaped
toward the tethered ponies where the other four were al-
ready mounting the pungent smell of scorched grass arose
and little tendrils of smoke curled up from beneath the
saber

  ben watched the sioux overtake the fleeing horses and
steer them back into the herd

  a rifle cracked one of the sioux threw up his hands
and slid to the ground while his riderless pony plowed into
the milling nervous herd

  the other four indians bent low over their ponies necks
put the herd between themselves and the forest from which
the shot had come

  ben groaned the shot could have come from no one
but the kid taken by surprise but warned now the
other four sioux were after the kid

  ben knew that there could be only one result they
would get him

  struggling bending and wriggling to hitch himself for-

ward an inch at a time ben worked toward the saber for
a brief second he poised over it and the smell of burned
flesh and hair mingled with that of the scorched grass as
he brought his hands down on it

 then the buckskin thongs burned in two and his hands
 were free

 ben crawled to the rifle it was still where the sioux
 had laid it he picked it up steadied it across his knees
 and got a bead on an indian who was crouching behind a
 horse at the shot the sioux dropped in his tracks

 for a moment there was tense silence then alarmed by
 the shooting the horse herd stampeded toward the bottom
 of the valley they stopped there to throw their heads up
 and stare back at the forest

 mounted whipping their ponies toward the shelter of the
 forest at the far end of the meadow the three sioux turned
 in their saddles and shot wildly

 bens eyes centered on the leader the one who had
 kicked him again he rested the rifle across his knees and
 shot a grunt of grim satisfaction escaped him when the
 indian tumbled from the pony

 shooting from the edge of the forest the kid got another

 the lone remaining sioux whipped his pony into the
 shelter of the trees and safety

 pe turned to watch the kid emerge from the trees the
 kids face was streaked with sweat the gaudy buck-
 skin suit he affected was dirty and disheveled he came
 close

 that darn stallion he panted i was ridin along
 nice as you please and all of a sudden he began to pitch
 like crazy i slipped and fell off him i followed him out
 here and run right into this

 howd the sioux get you ben aw gee they hurt
 your hands

 its nothin that a little time an bar grease wont fix
 ben murmured did you wait until sun-up kid

 no the kid admitted i started a little before i
 knew i could find the way it cant be far to the bowler
 river i figured id find it over three or four more hills

 he waved a hand straight westward

 it aint so very far ben murmured i-

 for a second the kid hesitated then

 aw gee ben you aint mad are you just because
 that stallion had a lot of luck and pitched me off it
 wouldnt happen again not in a million years how was i
 to know the stallion would smell his mares and want to
 get em

 honest i was goin to get the cavalry i can ride
 youll take me along with you some more wont you

 ben sighed and looked at the horses that were sixty
 now instead of thirty

 of course those with brands would have to go back to
 their owners if they were still alive but most of them were
 unbranded-and most of the owners probably werent
 alive

 he could catch his own saddle pony and with him get a
 mount for the kid

 he sighed again an expression of awed disbelief spread
 over his face once more the kid had won out where any-
 body else would have lost

 ill try not to be too mad he said feelingly and as
 for taking you along-i just wouldnt know what to do
 without you

 the kid beamed

 by arthur leo zagat

norman fentons army of liberty is steadily gath-
ering strength the opportunity for america to throw
off an alien tyranny is now at hand but first the
desperate tactics of yee hashamoto must be defeated the
asiric viceroy has summoned two divisions of troops to move
up from the panama canal and they will give him sufficient
strength to crush the american rebellion somehow those
two divisions must be halted

in this critical hour president norman fenton turns again
to dikar leader of the bunch the boys incredibly difficult
task will be this to go alone and secretly down into the jungles
of yucatan there to seek out the americans who fled into
that wild land at the time of the asafric invasion dikar
must rouse these people to strike at the advancing asafric
divisions

dikar is commanded to go without telling his wife
marilee of his mission and he obeys but she follows
him as does another girl of the bunch bessalton eventually
after hazardous adventures these three find an ally and
companion one jimcorbin it is he who guides them down
to the jjulf of mexico

  they are standing on the shore of the gulf bitterly dis-
heartened by the length of the journey still ahead of them
when they hear the sound of a fast motorboat soon they
see it it is approaching them and jimcorbin urges that they
hide but the boat dikar says is their one chance of reaching
yucatan and he has a plan   

chapter xv

warning in the sky

the put-put-put got louder as the boat came in
between the arms of land then it stopped but
peering through the leaves dikar saw that the
boat still came on toward the shore the water parting for
it sliding along the clean long curve of its sides

  a very fat yellow officer stood by the pole that stuck
up out of its middle a thin one stood up in the very front
leaning over and looking dpwn into the water and there
was another one in the back

  the one in the front yelled something all of a sudden
and the one in the back dropped something into the water
the boat stopped moving its nose very near the shore
the thin asafric climbed out on the nose of the boat and

the first installment of this four-part serial herein concluded appeared
in the argosy for march

jumped he landed on the sand and then the other two
jumped

  they came up on the sand a little way and looked
around as if they didnt know where they were the fat
asafrics face was round and greasy and his slant eyes
were very little

  the one who had been at the back of the boat limped
a little he turned to look out over the water and jabbered
something in his high-pitched voice the others turned
and jabbered as if they were excited and happy and
frightened all at the same time

  dikar tried to see what they were looking at but all
he could see was a tiny black cloud way off on the horizon
he shrugged stepped sideways into the road and walked
out on the sand

  hed left his rifle in theushes but hed made sure his
asafric uniform was fixed straight all the buttons but-
toned thodgh his hair and beard had grown a little so
that some gold showed at the roots he was sure no one
would notice it unless they came very close

   he kicked a shell on the sand with his bare foot stopped
and stood very straight as the thinnest of the asafrics
wheeled around his hand darting to the revolver butt in his
belt

  dikar snapped his right hand up to his head and down
again the way hed seen the black-soldiers do that time in
newyork the fat officers fingers dropped away from
his gun his high-pitched voice jabbered something that
dikar couldnt understand

  dikar grinned made noises with his mouth that sounded
like they meant something but didnt really doubletalk
the yellows stared at him puzzled-looking dikar smiled

asafric officer who dikr knew led a company of abys-
sinians capn sen me-

  never mind all that can you guide us to the closest
point where there are substantial buildings

  oh yaas sah i

  very well you will do so at once we do not wish
to be caught- get moving boy

  yaas sah dikar snapped his hand up to his head
again dis way he turned and started off along the path

the squelch of shoes in the muck told him the yellows
were following and he did not have to look back to
know that the tangled thick greenery forced them to
walk single file

  dikar speeded up his long strides got way ahead of the
first officer he went around the big trees at the sharp
bend in the path-dropped to hands and knees and crawled
under a bush beside the path

  not so fast the thin officers thinner voice called
we dont want to lose you

  he came around the tree a green length of vine
stretched across the road caught under his chin a bent-
down tree bough above snapped up lifted the asafric
straight up in the air as his frantic hands clawed at the
noose that had tightened around his neck

  he had time for a single agonized scream before the
trap like those dikar had so often set for rabbits but much
bigger cut off his breath the fat man plunged into sight

reaching for his gun dikars hands shot out from his
covert clamped on muddy ankles jerked the yellow
squealed squashed down into the mud dikar leaped on
his back and seized the soft throat

  a crunching thud told him that jimcorbin hiding the
other side of the path had brought his rifle-butt down
on the head of the thirdasafric the yellow officer pinned
under dikar struggled frantically but dikars fingers
tightened the roll of yellow fat at the back of the thick
neck turned slowly purple a long quiver ran through the
soft body and then it was very still high over it a thinner
corpse swayed back and forth with the trees gray looped
beards

  dikar unbent his stiffened finger shoved up to his
feet turned and went back past the tree he jumped
over what lay in the path there jimcorbins face was gray
his mouth straight and thin-lipped remind me about my
father he begged dikar remind me how my father
died

  im remindin myself about all the american men an
women who have died since the asafrics came an how they
died an how the rest have lived an im remindin my-
self about the asafric tanks that will soon be startin out
from panama

  dikar shook himself and then he was whistling bob-o-
link bob-o-link the way he used to on the mountain
when after supper and dishwashin he wanted to call
marilee away from the bunch

  bob-o-link the answer came in the dim green hush it
seemed a strange sound dikar and jimcorbin reached the
paths end and the girls met them there their faces
anxious

  the boat is ours dikar told them but only marilee
heard him because bessalton had ears and eyes only for
jimcorbin

  dikar was able to smile again seeing that and marilee
smiled at him and dikar knew that they were both smil-
ing because their friends had each found someone to end
heartache and loneliness

ome on everyone dikar said lets take the
v boat now its ours an start off i suppose you can
make it go like you could the truck jimcorbin

  surest thing you know jimcorbin grinned i can
run that pusher an i can sail her if we get a wind i did
plenty of both on old misissip when i was a youngster
but-i dunno he looked out over the water i dont
like the looks of this sky

  dikar looked out there too and the feeling that some-
thing terrible was going to happen was back the awful
emptiness the color of the sky and water that cloud on
the horizon was a little biggernow but only a very little
and there was still no wind

  i dont like it either he said watching how the
breathing of the water had gotten deeper longer but
we cant hang around here those asafric officers must
have come from somewhere nearby an when they dont
show up their friends will be out lookin for em weve
started somethin we cant stop

  jimcorbin nodded lets go then

  the boat was bigger when they got on it than it had
seemed from shore and it was all clean and shining every-
where the girls ran around it excited but dikar was
too busy helping jimcorbin and learning a lot of things
about a boat including a lot of new words
long road to tomorrow	

  he helped fimcorbin pull up the thing the limping
asafric had thrown into the water it was like a curved
arrow of iron pointed at both ends with another long
rod of iron fastened to the middle -this jimcorbin said
was an anchor

  he made dikar coil up the rope very neatly on the
boats floor that jimcorbin called its deck the tall pole
like a tree without branches which stuck up from the
middle of the deck was a mast the sail was a huge cloth
folded up and tied-reefed-to another pole that stuck
out from the mast and was called a boom the ropes that
would open the sail-unfurl it-were sheets

  toward the back-the stern-of the boat was a little
engine dikar turned a big iron wheel on this while jim-
corbin fiddled with it it wouldnt getvstarted and dikar
got mad and turned the flywheel around very fast and
then it was going around by itself and the engine was
put-put-putting

  jimcorbin grinned went to a sort of big wooden wheel
with a lot of handles sticking out from it he did some-
thing there hey dikar exclaimed the lands mov-
ing and then felt his face get red as jimcorbin threw
his head back and roared with laughter it was the boat
that was moving of course not the land

  the girls stood by the rail up in the prow of the boat
looking out across the gulf dikar could make out only
their outlines slim and lovely against the weird glow of
the sky ankle-length hair rippling very gently in the stir
of air through which the boat moved

co clear was the water that the boat seemed not to
 be on its surface but to be floating in midair that
reddish-yellow uneasy light under it as well as above you
gals better duck in the cabin jimcorbin called till we
get out of sight of land dikar an i are all right in our
uniforms but if someone on shore with a glass spots you
two-

  wheres the cabin marilee asked looking around i
dont see any

  that little house forward of the mast there

  oh

  they went into it dikar stood straddle-legged to the
slow rise and fall of the boat ive got a funny feeling
he said after a long while here in my stomach

  its going to get funnier jimcorbin said grinning
before youre much older say i think theres wind
coming off there	f

  dikar turned the way jimcorbin pointed they were
out past the headlands far off to the east the water was
no longer like a mirror lets get the sail up jimcorbin
said here ive got the wheel lashed give me a hand
with these sheets hey his fingers tightened on dikars
shoulder whats the matter you gone deaf

  no dikar muttered no i was just looking at that
cloud its spreadin awful fast

  it had spread all along the eastern horizon it was a
black mass all rolling in on itself the way the smoke of wet
wood does and the edges of the billows were a bright
yellow were in for a storm jimcorbin muttered well
get as much southing as we can before we have to reef
sail again

  they got the sail up and the wind came and filled it
jimcorbin stopped the engine the boat flew through the
water like a beautiful great bird the water hissing along
its side

   spray stung dikars cheeks cold and bracing he pulled
great breaths of the stinging fresh wind into his lungs
which had been muffled so long by the hot steamy air of
the queer woods and for a while he forgot the funny feel-
ing in his stomach

   but the water got rougher and the boat rose and fell
and the feeling came back im sick he groaned jim-
corbin im awful sick and just then the girls burst
out of the cabin their faces green their eyes staring out
of their heads they ran to the rail and the next moment
dikar was with them there

   dikar hated jimcorbin for his ringing laughter and
could cheerfully have killed him but he was much too busy

   after a while dikar felt a little better go on into the
cabin and lie down jimcorbin said ive already sent
the girls in

   dikar was so weak he had to hold on to things and drag
along the deck marilee lay groaning on a sort of shelf
that ran along one wall of the cabin inside and bessalton
suffered on the one that ran along theother wall so
dikar lay down on the floor and closed his eyes

   with his eyes closed he felt a little better and the slow
rise and fall rise and fall of the boat was soothing and
he fell asleep

nphe forest in which he wandered was dim and ominous
and the ground under his feet rose and fell rose and
fell in a very strange way

   marilee screamed somewhere and just then a black beast
dropped down on dikar and another leaped at him claw-
ing and it was marilee whod fallen on him from her shelf
and bessalton was clawing at him thrown clear across
the cabin from hers and the floor of the cabin slanted up
from where they were all tangled it was night and outside
the cabin was a terrible whistling howl and a loud crackt
ing and jimcorbin shouting something dikar couldnt
understand

   dikar got free of the girls somehow and somehow was
climbing to the cabin door it was shut something held
it shut something against which it took all his strength
to force the door open

   it was the wind that had held the door shut the wind
that howled and pinned dikar against the cabin wall
staring into a wild waste of water that slanted up into a
night sky not night a terrible sort of light filled the
air a lurid light and the sky was a black mass rolling
in on itself in tremendous billows edged with the yellow
and terrible light

  that loud cracking was the sail and jimcorbin was
fighting with the sheets his mouth open shouting some-
thing to dikar the sail split into a hundred flapping rib-
bons that tore away from the mast

   dikar fought up the slant of the deck fought the wind
till he got one arm around the mast to which jimcorbin
clung what he yelled what storm

   storm hell jimcorbin shouted in his ear this-
is-a hurricane

chapter xvi

hands or the hurricane

cfhere was no up or down no east or west for an
endless time the world had been nothing but a howling
madness that beat dikar into a sort of nightmare numbness
	argosy

   vaguely he knew that he still lived vaguely he knew
that the shadowy shapes he saw now and then within some
less violent flurry of the storm were jimcorbin and marilee
and bessalton theyd gotten the girls out of the cabin
in those first few frantic moments and lashed them with
ropes to the mast

   there was no cabin any more there was no mast only
a jagged stump sticking up out of the welter of foam that
forever had been pouring across the deck washing to
dikars knees to his waist fighting to break the lashings
that cut into him

   that tree-thick pole had snapped right through feet
over his head and so great was the roar of the storm that
he had not heard it so great was the strength of the
hurricane that the huge mast and its trailing ropes had
soared almost straight up into the driving murk like a dry
leaf on fall wind and so had not crushed the pigmy humans
lashed to its splintered stump

   that had been very long ago since then a night must
have come a morning returned because there had been
a blackness and now there was this lurid terrible glow
or had there been many nights and mornings or none
dikar could not figure how long it had been he could not
think could not feel he was hardly dikar at all only a
something half-drowned half-stunned too beaten to be
even afraid

   and suddenly he was afraid suddenly the boat was
shivering beneath him its fabric groaning ready to break
apart at last each separate small inch of it screaming

   a loose rope-end slatted sharply somewhere queer
that dikar could hear these small sounds above the deafen-
ing wind-and then he realized the amazing truth there
was no wind

   there was no wind all of a sudden and though about
the crippled hulk a vast and foam-streaked waste heaved
mountainously water and air were separate again

slumped against his lashings a head lolling dikar
saw the water run from the deck and the deck appear
splintered but whole he lifted his head turned it to
marilee

water streamed from her wet and battered body hair
was soaked and stringy about her slimness but her eyes
lifted to meet his and in them he saw the same wild
unbelieving joy that he knew must be in his own eyes
its over he cried its finished an were saved
says you jimcorbins voice was husky tired to the
point of agony but still held a shadow of his familiar
chuckle i hate to disappoint you lad an lassies but
this isnt the end of the hurricane weve simply come
into its windless center into the eye of the storm in a
little while it will come again from the other direction
oh no marilee sobbed no jimcorbin the boat
cant live through much more

   no it cant it cant live through another fifteen
minutes of that kind of beating well folks his blue lips
grinned its been nice knowing you i-

   jimcorbin bessalton cried from the other side of the
mast dikar look off there

   dikar strained around against the tightness of the ropes
craned to see what it was toward which she flung out a
tense trembling arm heaving water a wrack of cloud
a darker loom within the cloud formless-

   land jimcorbin gasped thats land

   marilees hand somehow reached clasped dikars

land she whispered do you hear dikar its land
an were saved

  hold it jimcorbin said hold everything that
shore whatever it is is two miles off at least maybe more
were drifting parallel to it or a little away if anything
our sails gone an even if we could rig one in the time
weve got there is no wind at all howre we going to
get to it

   the engine of course dikar was surprised hed for-
gotten well get the engine started-

   take a look jimcorbin jerked his chin to the stern
dikar looked there and saw a couple of twisted bolts
sticking up from split boards a broken pipe nothing
else the pusher went overboard long ago an im afraid
there are no oars aboard now if we had wings maybe-
we have arms legs dikar fumbled at his belt his
knife was still in its pocket how long have we jimcorbin
before the storm swoops back

  an hour maybe maybe a little more

  time enough to swim there the knife was already
cutting dikar free but well have to hurry

jimcorbin was slashing the ropes that held him to
the masts stump while dikar worked on marilees
then having freed bessalton jimcorbin said no
sharks the storm will have sent them to the bottom
theres a chance a bare chance of getting away with it
dikar tore off the rags the storm had made of his asafric
uniform get undressed jimcorbin hurry up the
girls didnt need to be told theyd slipped off their wet
sarongs were knotting their long hair in great bundles
brown black atop their heads what are you waitin for
jimcorbin stared at the other side of the boat i-i-
he stammered his face getting red  know i ought to
but-

  but what dikar snapped wondering what had come
over him well be racin the storm an every little thing
that might slow us up must be got rid of

  i know but-

   marilee caught jimcorbins arm twisted him around to
her you idiot she blazed madder than dikar had ever
seen her youre ashamed of seein me an bessalton with-
out clothes an havin us see you without em

   but still dikar couldnt understand why jimcorbin was
troubled just as hed never understood why walt had
made the bunch cover themselves up at wespoint the boys
with fawnskins an the girl with their sarongs what was
there about ones body to be ashamed of

   what you ought to be ashamed of marilee was say-
ing is the dirtiness that makes you ashamed

  but-but marilee-

   oh i know she broke in it isnt your fault youve
been taught to think that the body god gave you is dirty
an to be hidden no matter what well she shrugged let-
ting go of him if youd rather be drowned then have
bessalton an me see you naked all right but dont expect
us to be such fools

   you win jimcorbin grinned like a kid thats been
caught doing some silly thing he started to pull off his
uniform

dikar lifted an arm over his head and put it into the
water and kicked eyes squinted shut against the salt
burn of the water he lifted the other arm and put it into
the water and kicked
long road to tomorrow



  hed been doing this forever arm kick arm kick
he would keep on doing it forever arm kick he was
tired awful tired somewhere far off there was a rumbling
the storm returning

  what was the use why not stop and sink peacefully
into the green quiet water before the storm came

  look jimcorbins voice was in his ear look there
dikar

  dikar opened his eyes that mass not far-strange
trees leaning all branches stripped from them green
stuff fluttering but the vast howling of the storm wind
nearing swiftly come on come on marilee come on
everybody

  fast fast never mind how tired fast toward that
smother of foam that hollow boom of water on land the
water had a thousand hands plucking at dikar to pull
him back the water had a thousand fists battering him
but he fought it

  he fought it and had an arm to help marilee fight it
and all of a sudden there was ground under his feet and
he was dragging marilee up out of the angry water and
they were on land no more water and he knew that jim-
corbin and bessalton were staggering beside them and the
rumble of the hurricane was coming closer

  keep going jimcorbin gasped weve got to find-
some sort of shelter keep going

  they were in the woods staggering stumbling away
from the shore they were threshing into the woods there
were smells in dikars nostrils smells of soaked earth of
broken wood sap oozing

  they were fighting through a nightmare tangle of green-
ery twisted vines uprooted trees queer trees their trunks
furred with red hairvinstead of bark queer leaves long
and narrow and spreading from a middle point like fingers
of a spread hand or was it the swiftly deepening dark-
ness that made them seem so queer the lurid glow like
the strange light of a dreadful dream

  i-i cant go any further dikar heard bessalton
whimper close behind and heard jimcorbin grunting
youve got to weve got to beat that storm-

it struck it pounced on the woods like some gigantic
howling beast and the woods exploded into an awful
roar about them filled with a crash of falling trees a hail
of flying splinters

  dikar tightened his arm around marilee saw that her
mouth was open shouting something but he could not
hear her terror leaped into her eyes and she dragged
back on him her hands grabbing at him pulling him to
a stop

  right here right in front of dikar thunder crashed
no not thunder  where there had been only wind-threshed
green a huge furred tree-trunk lay it would have struck
him had marilee not dragged him back

  it rocked was trying to roll would crush them if it
rolled they had to get away from it but it blocked them
off back then they couldnt go back another tree had
crashed behind them just behind jimcorbin and bessalton
who stared at it eyes dazed mouths twisted grotesquely

  the huge tree-trunks shielded them a little from the
almost solid wind but the rocking trunks were a greater
danger if one or both rolled just a little more   

  dikar looked to the rigjit the trees slanted to each
other blocked escape to the left then the great masses
of their roots had some space between the roots were

packed with earth they must have left deep pits where
they pulled out all that earth

  this way dikar shouted but he knew that even
marilee crushed to him could not hear he shoved her in
the direction he wanted her to go beat with his fists at
bessalton and jimcorbin to make them understand fran-
tically he drove them along between the rocking trees
past the root masses

  the full force of the solid wind hit them but even in
the half-night dikar saw hed been right there were
deep holes here where roots had spread for ages on ages
he threw himself against marilee jimcorbin and they all
went down into one of the holes together tumbled in
slithery mud at its bottom

  the wind was not quite so bad the shreds of the storm-
ripped woods went by overhead dikar untangled himself
from the floundering mud-plastered bodies lifted his head
he saw a black opening in the earth-wall to one side
blinked hitched himself to it

  and then he was waving wildly to the others his mouth
forming a shout they could not hear a cave its a cave
were saved

  they could not hear him but they saw what he wanted
floundered to him dikar shoved bessalton past him into
the black hole then the two others and he crawled into
it himself

  it was black dark in there and the roar of the storm
was loud behind but the storm no longer battered them

rvikar lay panting he lifted his head all of a sudden
his nostrils flaring the air in here smelled musty
dead and by that dikar knew that this was an old cave
the roots and the trees had grown up to cover

  there was a smell of salt water too strangely and be-
neath the roar of the storm he could hear a hollow boom-
ing like that which had -pounded his ears before hed
gotten deep into the woods that meant that somewhere
this cave must have another openingto the gulf

  these things flashed through dikars mind as he stared
into the dark but they were not what had brought his head
up so sharply not what made him stare so intently over
the pale forms of his companions into the dimness beyond
another smell threaded the smells of rock and earth and
ancient wood a smell that frightened him

  what was it it was not so dark any longer in there
his eyes were getting used to the night and by the little
light filtering in through the opening behind he saw
that the cave was narrow too low for a man to stand
upright for a little way but further in it widened in
that bigger part he saw-

  blackness ismashed down on him with a tremendous
crash bessalton screamed its all right jimcorbin
grunted ah thats happened is that the palms rolled
over and its roots have closed up the entrance

  dikars skin was an icy sheath for his body the way
out was blocked naked defenseless they were shut in
here with the dreadful thing hed made out deep there
within the cave in the instant before all light went

chapter xvii

house of the gods

that which dikar had seen there in the blackness
had been man-shape in a bloated hideous sort of way


argosy

but it had been high as two of the tallest men dikar had
ever seen wide as four and it had been gray all over
the gray of something long dead

  its head was a full half of its height neckless squarish
and thick through as its swollen-bellied body and it had the
beak of a bird the great hook-curved sharp and cruel beak
of an enormous eagle each side of that beak there was
a black pit round huge within which terrible eyes had
seemed to lurk

  something touched dikar and he whirled but it was
marilees hand whats the matter she demanded her
voice suddenly sharp against the muffled storm-roar
whats scared you

  nothin he grunted pushing ahead of her a little so
that hed be between her and that thing im not scared
but be quiet for the love of god quiet

  crouched dry-mouthed he strained to catch the smallest
sound the things pointed ears grotesquely small at the
corners of its square head had been perked in the instant
hed glimpsed it as if it had been trying to separate the
noises they made from the storm-howl the far-off boom
of storm-roused waters had it heard them was it creep-
ing toward them now silent stealthy

  but it couldnt it was too big much too big to get
into this part of the cave where they were it couldnt get
at them as long as they stayed here they were safe

  dikar let himself breathe again even made himself laugh
a little i thought-no tellin what the storm might have
driven in here he said wed better be careful folks
keep close together not move around at all till we can
see where were goin there might be snakes or hidden
holes in the cave-floor-

  you are scared marilee broke in the way youre
babblin i know youre terrible scared dikar you did see
somethin what was it you saw

  some shadow i guess some trick of light an shade
no dikar light an shade dont smell like fresh-spilt
blood

  that was it that was what this smell was that had
frightened him even before he saw the thing    what
was that what was that deep hoarse noise

  someone groaned bessalton exclaimed i heard some-
one groan way in there

  jimcorbin made a queer sound with his throat some-
bodys in there badly hurt hear it from within the
lightless secret depths the hoarse moan came again must
have been smashed during the first part of the storm
crawled in here weve got to help him dikar come on

jthere was a rattle of little stones as he lifted no
dikar flung out a terrified hand in that direction
caught hold of a stubbled jaw no jimcorbin dont move
marilee bessalton dont any of you dare move from
here

  what the devil

  what is it dikar marilees calm low voice asked
tell us what has you so scared we have a right to know
were not babies what did you see back there

  i dont know

  thats crazy you must know what you saw

  i ought to but i just dont believe it dikar told about
it i think the worst part is its color he ended gray
like dead wood or weathered stone-

  a roar of laughter from jimcorbin broke in on him a
howl of rollicking laughter im not kiddin dikar

flared angry i did see that gray thing back there

  sure jimcorbin spluttered sure you saw it old
man he managed to stop laughing but its nothing
to be frightened of its gray like stone because it is stone
its a statue carved out of stone and the men that carved
it have been dead for at least six centuries if i remember
my archaeology right what you saw was the statue of a
mayan god

 mayan what-

  the mayas were the people of a vanished civilization
by the lord harry i just realized-that statue shows
that weve reached exactly the place we were aiming for
yucatan

  this peninsula was the mayas last refuge and its jungle
is full of their relics huge pyramids like the one at chichen
itza temples like the one at uxmal sacrificial wells your
sculptured friend in there has probably had countless
human sacrifices made to him in his time but that sort of
thing hasnt happened for hundreds of years- he
checked

  it was only a shadow of sound now deep there in the
blackness a shadow of a word help marilees fingers
dug into dikars arm help the word whispered to
them again

  english marilee breathed oh dikar its an amer-
ican that lies hurt in there an hes heard us hes callin
to us to help him weve got to dikar weve got to find
an help him

  yes sure but we cant go plungin in there without
bein able to see a thing were liable to break a leg any-
thin might happen if only there was some way to get
some light

  theres pieces of dry wood here where i am that
was bessalton they feel like pieces of some root broken
off when the tree fell

  an there are all these loose stones around dikar felt
better now there was something to do wait there bessal-
ton im comin there to you

tte found her without trouble cleared a space on the
rock floor where she was took some bits of root-bark
from her and scratched fuzz from their inside surface with
his fingernails he made a little pile of this felt for and
picked up two stones cracked them together near the fuzz

  sparks flew were gone dikar cracked the stones to-
gether again they sparked but nothing happened he
kept on doing this he kept on doing it till his hands were
sore his fingers aching

  no use jimcorbin sighed youre just wasting time
an meanwhile that poor brutes stopped calling

  wastin time am i dikar grunted look one of
the countless sparks hadnt gone out it glowed a red dot
in the black where the pile of fuzz was dikars hands went
down to it he let his breath drift across it

  nobody moved nobody spoke the spot brightened
grew dikar dared to breathe a little more strongly the
pile of fuzz was all alight and it throbbed like a bright
red heart dikar broke a little splinter from the piece of
bark in his hands put it on the red pile but it went dark

  now youve spoiled it jimcorbin groaned but dikar
kept blowing very carefully at last a flame popped out
of the splinter yellow no bigger than a flys wing dikar
held his breath and with his fingertips put another tiny
splinter across the first it caught a third splinter spread
the flame a little more a fourth quite a bit bigger
long road to tomorrow



  dikars fire was growing swiftly now he could feed
it the sticks bessalton handed him small ones at first
then bigger and bigger ones

  a small but healthy bonfire crackled on the caves stony
floor dikar sat back on his haunches and grinned at
jimcorbin the latter grinned back i apologize he said
here he thrusti a piece of twisted root at dikar wrist-
thick about the length of his forearm this will make
a good torch lets get it lit and go take a look-see

  the firelight threw black wavering shadows on the rocky
walls naked except for the mud with which they were
plastered crouched in the red glow the four of them looked
exactly like the people in a picture walt once showed to
dikar of humans who lived on earth thousands and thou-
sands of years ago

  dikar lifted the root its tip flaming now said come
on jimcorbin you girls stay here by the fire an wait
for us

  like fun we will bessalton came back at him you
two can go ahead but were goin to be right behind you

 but-

  stop arguin marilee snapped i havent heard the
hurt man a long while now if we waste any more time
well be too late to help him

  dikar shrugged picked up a fist-size stone from the
rubble waited for jimcorbin to do the same they had to
go on hands and knees the roof of the cave was so low
but it was wide enough so that they two could crawl side
by side and the girls the same way behind them

  dikar had to hold the torch right in front of him and
it blinded him to what was ahead but as they went on
the smell of blood grew stronger all of a sudden the floor
ended dikar stopped was bumped into by one of the
girls heard jimcorbin gasp almighty  look at that 

rilkar looked saw that the torchlight had spread out
into a huge cave but those high rock walls that wide
stone floor were too smooth too straight to be the walls 
and floor of a cave this was a huge room men had hol-
lowed out in the depths of the earth long ago

  in the wall opposite was a black hole like this one and
out of that hole came the booming of the gulf like a shelf
beneath the two openings was the topmost of three descend-
ing rows of huge squared stones that end to end ran
all around the cavern they were benches where many
people could sit and look at the gray statue thick-legged
swollen-bellied hawk-beaked it stood on a great stone
platform in the center

  on this platform across the statues talons lay a man
naked except for a narrow belt of gold around his waist
and a curiously looped wider strap of green and gold which
went down between his legs and around under him

  did i say there were no human sacrifices any more
jimcorbin muttered i was a liar dikar

  the mans eyes were closed but his hands were pressed
to his belly and they were brown-splotched with blood it
had come from a deep and terrible gash that still was
scarlet with undried blood

  the mans chest moved he breathed shallowly he
was still alive dikar thrust the torch into jimcorbins
hand leaped down into the cavern bounded across its
floor and up on the platform to kneel beside the man

  help the faint moan came from black shriveled lips

  helps here dikar said we heard you and came
to you

the bluish eyelids flickered opened and half-seeing
eyes found dikars face true    heard english   
thought    dreaming the lids closed again water
gosh dikar groaned wherem i goin to find water
in here

  spring a hand jerked sideways as if to point
behind

  ill go look marilees head was at the platform level
i think i heard it as i climbed down i think i know
where he means

  she sped away into a growing light jimcorbin was
running along the top tier of benches touching his flame
to other torches slanting out from the wall held by stone
brackets they flared

  marilee was tugging a a gold ring fastened to one of
the stones in the lowest row bessalton came to help her
and the two girls pulled hard the stone was sliding out
dikar heard a tiny tinkle of water

  he turned back to the man beside whom he knelt shes
found it youll have your water the skin drawn tightly
over a skull-like head was beginning to shine like wax
the scrawny chest was fighting for air if the man died
before dikar found out-who are you dikar cried
hen-small

  no he had to know i mean are you an american
are you one of those who escaped across the gulf when
the asafrics came

  escaped the corners of the tortured mouth twitched
yes escaped-asafrics

  dikars heart pounded his ribs where are they
hed found them this hensmall was one of them and
he could tell where the others were where he must
tell before the man died where do i go to find the
others

  go the cracked mouth was open now in a hideous
grimace thell mlad the voice that came from it
was a crows caw come wi me an find em in hell im
th last-th last of em all

  here is water

  marilee shoved past dikar knelt gently lifted hen-
smalls head and held a gold cup to his mouth dikar
saw her through a gray throbbing haze sunk back on his
haunches he stared at the hawk-gods monstrous thick legs
and he was all empty inside and all he could hear was that
crow-caw the last im the last of em all

  this was the end of his journey from the mountain
the long long road to tomorrow had ended in the same
black yesterday where it began

chapter xviii

this finery is for death

there were murmurs around dikar a hand was on his
shoulder was shaking him gently a voice jimcorbins
was asking whats the matter dikar whats struck
you

  dikar said dully were licked hes the last-

  the last hensmalls hoarse whisper repeated the
word last of five hundred marilee was supporting his
head and his eyes were open again bright with a strange
black fire we licked th asafrics we licked th storms
on th gulf

  a new strength had come to his hoarse voice a strange
flare-up we licked th jungle he wasnt looking at


argosy

marilee or at any of them he was staring up into the
fierce face of the gray statue that loomed above them but
we couldnt lick yer copper-colored devils they did fer
us one by one an sent us thell tuh lookfor yeh

  lie quiet an youll be all right marilee murmured
to him but that strange hoarse babble went on

   yeh-re white they say an we were white so they sent
us tuh th white mans hell tuh look fer yeh an tell yeh
tuh come back tuh them five hundred one by one an im
the last mebbe ill find yeh mebbe ill find yeh in hell
but ill be damned if ill tell yeh they want yeh back
kukulcan

  jimcorbin grunted and his fingers dug into dikars
shoulder dyeh hear me hensmall shrieked sitting all
the way up now with impossible strength im th last
an i wont send yeh back tuh them an so theyre licked
licked-

  a terrible croaking laugh broke into the words arched
the wasted body flung it back down on the stone floor
and left it there lifeless

  oh marilee whispered

  hes better off than we are jimcorbins mouth was
grim as he said that his face lined as he bent and got
fingers under marilees elbow urging her up to her feet
his troubles are over come on lets get off this thing
come on dikar-bessalton

bessalton stopped half-turned toward the black hole
where theyd come in i think the storms ended
people she was trying to get their thoughts off what
theyd just heard and seen i dont hear the wind any
more

  yeah it didnt last as long as the first part of the
hurricane jimcorbin was looking at the other hole
the one out of which the boom of the wide water came
to fill the cavern but the waves will stay high for a long
while yet thank god	t

  marilee twisted to him why do you say that jim-
corbin why are you glad that the waves will stay high
a long time

  because- he checked and his face was cut by deep
lines old-looking all right he decided theres no
sense my holding back as long as the sea stays high that
entrance is inaccessible and since the other one is blocked
were safe here

  safe what do you mean

  the mayas of course they-

  but you said the mayas vanished long ago

   i said that their civilization did the people themselves
didnt degenerate reverted to savagery they still prowl
this jungle i knew that what i didnt know was that
their religion still lived their religion of human sacrifice
their worship of kukulcan

thats what hensmall called that dreadful statue
exactly that gave me the clue to the rest of his
delirium kukulcan was their-well their human per-
sonification of their god something like our christ is to us

  sometime in the past the legend goes he lived among
men and those were the mayas golden days a long long
time ago he went away and their troubles began but they
believe he will come back to earth some day and raise them
again to their ancient glory

  they made statutes of him marilee was big-eyed
an they killed people in front of the statues so that theyd
go look for kukulcan an tell him to come back

  yes it didnt work though and finally they gave up
but to understand this youve got to know that in the
ancient legend kukulcan wasnt copper-colored but white

  so when the white refugees showed up here in their
jungle the mayas must have gotten the idea that what
had been wrong all the time was theyd been sending
copper-colored souls as messengers to him while he natur-
ally would be in some white part of the other world

  the rest is plain enough they captured the americans
whenever they got a chance and-

  brought them here bessalton whispered killed em
one by one what beasts

upvont marilee put her hand on bessaltons arm

       dont call em that because weve been doin almost
the same thing weve been killin humans to make things
better for ourselves isnt that almost the same thing
oh bessalton cried how can you say that were
in a war-

  hold it hold it you two jimcorbin tried to grin
but his lips were too stiff right now what we ought to
be thinking about is getting out of here before the sea
goes down and those birds come back

  what makes you so sure they will come back as soon
as the sea goes down dikar had got interested after all
jimcorbin they think hensmall was the last one of the
whites and so why should they hurry back

  because they didnt finish i read a lot about all this
when i was a kid and i know that this sacrifice wasnt
finished

  how how do you know

  his heart- hell dikar i dont want to explain the
bloody business but take it from me they were driven
from here by the coming of the hurricane before they
finished and so theyll be back if they find us here when
they come-four more whites-well what happens to us
wont be pretty weve got to get out of here
where where will we go

  anywhere so its not here

  out in the jungle dikar kept on do you think well
be safe out there five hundred americans werent no
no jimcorbin i dont want to be hunted day after day
night after night i say we stay here an if your mayas
come die fightin em

  very fine a very fine sentiment my boy theres only
one thing wrong with it look at us jimcorbin spread
his arms wide naked as the day we were born empty-
handed what are we going to fight with

  dikar jimcorbin we have got things to fight em
with marilee was excited clothes to wear an arms to
fight with we have loads of em

  we have jimcorbin stared at her where

  in here behind the stone we pulled out come she
caught his wrist was pulling at him come ill show you

rphey went around the end of the big stone and through
the place where it had been and the light from the
torches around the wall of the big cavern followed them
threw their shadows ahead of them into a dim space that
held the tinkle of running water

  dikar came into that space and all of a sudden there
was a glory in that dimness a glory of green and scarlet
and blue and yellow vivid and glowing	

  gosh he breathed oh gosh

the blues and scarlets and greens were feathers hanging
long road to tomorrow



on one stone wall cloaks woven of feathers belts head-
dresses of long feathers colored like no feathers dikar had
ever seen

  and the yellow-that was gold golden bowls and cups
and plates piled in niches cut into another wall hundreds
of them and there were spears of gold gold bows strung
with cord of golden wire knives of gold whose handles
were a green transparent stone flashing in the dim light so
brightly that it hurt dikars eyes to look at them and all
the golden things had pictures hammered into them beau-
tiful pictures of men dressed in the feathery finery

  a treasure house jimcorbin murmured a fortune
in the gold the conquistadores hunted and the indians hid
from them a fortune-and not worth a tinkers damn to
us pd give you the whole shooting match for a bellyful
of food

  theres food here too marilee answered him here
she darted to the other end of the room where the tinkle
of water came from strange-looking fruits but they must
be good to eat

  dikar saw them piled against the wall and he saw the
spring that trickled out of the mouth of a snake carved on
the wall and ran into a little bowl below it was a queer
snake it had wings

  i get it jimcorbin pointed to a couple of golden
chains that hung from rings fastened to the wall between
the spring and the pile of fruits they chain their sac-
rificial victim here till they are ready and since he s to
be honored to the gods they make sure that hes well fed

  seeing that were going to be honored that way we
might as well take everything that goes with it but i
make a motion that we get washed first and get some
clothes on

   i havent forgotten your lecture marilee he chuckled
but since it isnt going to hinder us from dying when our
hosts return to make us welcome im quite sure you wont
scold me for wanting to meet my maker properly dressed
and in a style to which im not accustomed

  of course jimcorbin in fact-and she laughed-
bessalton an i cant wait to get into those wonderful
things ourselves

  they were all of a sudden merry as theyd ever been 
on the mountain they knew they were going to die soon
and so it seemed easy to find pleasure in small things

tm awful glad i washed out the black from your
--hair an beard marilee told dikar i like havin
my blond mate back again an i think you look fine

  i feel like an awful fool the only thing dikar liked
about this business was the bow he had in his hand a bent
arc of gold sweetly balanced and the quiver of golden-
shafted scarlet-feathered and obsidian-pointed arrows
slung over his shoulder im goin to take it off

  dont you dare turn around an let me see how you
look from the back

   dikar turned slowly the great cloak of brilliant feath-
ers wasnt so bad it was light at least and warm and the
designs that had been woven into it-of winged snakes
and snarling wildcats and so on-were interesting to look
at	

  it was the towering headdress marilee had put on his
head that bothered him why it was half as high again
as he was and two feet wide it was all waving green
feathers and carved wood painted in bright colors it
was a silly thing for anyone to wear

    dont you think hes beautiful bessalton marilee
  asked laughing

    hes pretty swell the other girl answered but i
  think jimcorbin looks better even if you did take the
  best things for dikar

    wait ive got an idea jimcorbin turned around
  listen kids ive been thinking about that poor fellow
  up there on the altar we cant bury him but we could
  at least cover him up and say a prayer over him

    oh yes the smiles died from their faces i know
  just the thing bessalton exclaimed a beautiful blanket
  woven out of green feathers she disappeared behind the
  big stone was back with it again come on

    they climbed to the platform aid the girls covered
  hensmalls stiffening body then they straightened looked
  around expectantly

    go ahead jimcorbin dikar muttered you know
  what to say

    well    look lets do this thing right you stand
  here right in front of this statute and the gals either side
  of you jimcorbin moved them to the positions he meant
  an i- he stiffened weve got visitors

    dikar followed the direction of his suddenly narrowed
  eyes to the opening they hadnt been thinking about at all
  the one from the jungle a figure dropped from it to the
  top of the bench underneath a red-brown weazened man
  with long black hair a flattened squash-nosed face naked
  except for a breech-clout around his middle

    the maya twisted saw them froze but another came
  through the opening and a third and they all had long
  black tubes in their hands and from the tunnel behind
  them came a great rustling that told of many more coming

    caught jimcorbin whispered caught out in the open
  where we havent even a chance

    ill get a couple dikar muttered snatching an arrow
  from his quiver and fitting it to the bow before they
  get us

chapter xix

return op kukulcan

  the first maya squealed something in evident terror
  - dikars muscles bulged as he stretched his bow no
  jimcorbin snapped no dikar hold that pose but
  dont shoot dont move

    there were five or six of the little brown men out there
  now and they made a mark one couldnt miss why
  dikar demanded why shouldnt i shoot

    that was a sort of queer spanish that brute yelled and
  i think- by jehosaphat we have got a chance-a
  damned good chance hold it hold it everybody dont
  show them youre scared just stay the way you are
  look at that

    the brown men had dropped to their knees there on
  the stone top of the benches they were bending forward
  till their heads touched the stone no more were coming
  out of the black hole

    i dont understand bessalton whispered i dont
  understand why theyre doin that -
  jimcorbin grunted its plain enough heres dikar
  standing over their sacrifice the last white they had to
  sacrifice to kukulcan hes tall gigantic in that head-
  dress and hes blond-haired blond-bearded white-faced
  they think hes-
	argosy

  kukulcan marilee exclaimed

  exactly that hurricane-it broke just as they were
making the sacrifice you see he came on the wings
of the hurricane

  put your bow down now dikar but slowly with dig-
nity and then the way a god would in a sort of fatherly
way sorrowful because of their sins but forgiving beckon
to them to come nearer

  nearer but-

  do as i say youre kukulcan youre their white
god who went away centuries ago and now youve come
back because- he broke off and then his eyes bright-
ened youve come back because their ancient enemies
the toltecs are coming from the south again as they did
long ago to destroy them

  the toltecs are coming in great monsters of steel and
with thunders to demolish them but youve come to lead
your children against the monsters of the toltecs do
you understand

  i understand dikar murmured yes jimcorbin
he lowered his bow slowly and slowly he lifted his arm
and beckoned his worshipping people to him

tut they did not move they stayed there bowed
to the stone they didnt see me jimcorbin they
dont dare to look at me

  call them

  i dont know their language they wont understand
me

  call them anyway call them in the doubletalk you
used on the beach ill talk to them ill tell them you
speak only with the tongue of the gods the ancient for-
gotten language an thats why you brought me along to
interpret your words to them

  all right dikar said and then his mouth opened and
sounds came from it they were meaningless sounds but
they were deep-chested and round and booming in that
great cavern like a gods sounds should be and the little
brown men looked up and then dikar waved them to come
to him standing straight in his feathered cloak the way
a god should stand his headdress towering over him
making him gigantic

  dikar called the mayas and they came the six whod
bowed to him came and more and more crawling out of
the black hole from the jungle till the altar was ringed
around by a sea of the long-haired flat-nosed brown little
men kneeling to their god kukulcan 

  and then kukulcan spoke to them his voice like thun-
der and the little god utzlcoatl spoke to them in their
own tongue and told them why it was that kukulcan had
at last answered the messengers they had sent to him why
he had come to them and what they must do

  from a history oj the asiatic-african world hege-
mony zajir uscudan ph d bombay lld singa-
pore f i h s etc third edition vol  chap  ft

  most of the legend of dikar is apocryphal but there is
nothing apocryphal about the record of the posthumous
court-martial of lieutenant general miyamara

  miyamara himself was dead of course by hara-kiri but
viceroy yee hashamoto was not willing that he should
thus easily escape punishment for the loss of three hundred
asafric tanks and the defeat of hashamotos brilliant plan
to put an end to the great uprising of his american slaves

  here is an extract from this record a small part of the 
story of an officer major wan hunan for his part in the
debacle he died under the lash on the plaza before city
hall in new york

  i was riding in my staff car at the head of my battalion
of tanks along the narrow defile where the pan-american
highway pierces the sierra madre between queseltenango
guatamala and tapachulai chiapas mexico

  it was an exceedingly hot day and since neither our
reeonnaisance planes nor the outflanking scouts had re-
ported any intimation of danger i followed orders in
permitting my men to ride with turrets open those who
could be spared from the actual operation of their vehicles
were allowed to dispose themselves in the outer portions
thereof so as to be as cool as possible

  quite suddenly my driver collapsed lieutenant li
togo riding alongside him in the front seat seized the
wheel and fell dead over it i noted a little feathered dart
in his neck then became aware of a terrific crash behind
me as the two lead tanks collided

  in the next instant huge boulders descended from the
cliffs above thundering into the tanks all along the line
causing damage ranging all the way from a simple destruc-
tion of the caterpillar tread to a complete overturn of the
vehicle

  these gigantic stones caused a number of casualties but
the confusion they brought about the screams of the
wounded men the shouts of those who were merely fright-
ened was worse than the actual damage

  all this time not a human being had appeared

  my superstitious blacks were about to break in
desperation i shouted the order to fire anyway into the
jungle at the top of the cliffs anywhere as the men
began to execute this order a horde of copper-colored
savages rushed onto the highway a human wave of ap-
palling fury

  many of my blacks died but the others seeing a hu-
man enemy now fought bravely the brown attackers
wavered and victory was in our grasp but in that in-
stant a great voice bellowed unintelligible sounds through
the screams and crash of the conflict and on a rock high
above the road i saw what appeared to be a gigantic bird
feathers flashing in vivid colors

  before my very eyes the bird became a veritable
colossus of a man blond-haired blond-bearded from a
bow of solid gold he sent arrow after arrow into the
seething madness below and each arrow seemed to multi-
ply into a hundred screeching savages against whose knives
my blacks were helpless   

  there follows an account of major humans own escape
which if we wish to believe him was accomplished by epic
feats of strength and endurance what interests us how-
ever is the way he sums up this one story of what was
perhaps dikars greatest single exploit thus

  there may be some consolation your excellency and
most honorable members of this court-martial in the re-
flection that this disaster was brought about by an inex-
plicable raid of savages-an accident so to speak that
could not have been foreseen-and not by the presumptu-
ous american slaves whose puny efforts against the might
of our armies are foredoomed to failure

  may the writer in the interests of historic accuracy point
out that the savages were americans the oldest race of
americans that still exists on the western continent

fphere are times when we think

    of taking up some comparatively
 simple occupation like running the
 united states or lecturing on the
 fourth dimension for even the
 president is not supposed to know
 everything about everything and we
 are at least it seems that way

   we get into complications because
 our authors bring so many different
 subjects into their stories for in-
 stance we may have a story in which
 the author speaks learnedly of the
 mechanical intricacies of a steam-roll-
 er well we publish it not knowing
 anything about steam-rollers our-
 selves but taking it for granted that
 the author has his facts right

   a few weeks later a letter arrives
 frorn a man who has spent the best
 years of his life inside a steam-roller
 the story is all wrong he say justi-
 fiably indignant and of course that
 makes us unhappy we are all the
 more unhappy because we havent un-
 derstood a word of our correspon-
 dents discussion of the steam-roller

   youll see what we mean shortly
 we are about to present a lengthy
 and expert disquisition on the rifle

f j leslie

    have been a reader of your mag-
 azine for about twenty years still
 think it is fine but some stories are
 not up to the standard of years ago
 one of my favorite authors is jim
 kjelgaard he must be a real out-
 doors man the way he writes

   well-to get to the object of this
 letter-i have been noticing some
 technical blunders concerning fire-
 arms by some of your authors be-
 ing a rifleman myself i take excep-
 tion to a statement of richard sale
 in his story design for valor

   the gun pilser carried was a
 - remington automatic i
 find no remington automatic in
 their catalogue with a hammer or a
 half-cock hammer safety the only
 automatic they have-or ever had
 as far as i know-is a hammerless
 with a thumb safety

   it is cocked the first time by a
 knob on the bolt after firing it
 automatically cocks itself until the
 ammunition in the magazine is ex-
 hausted it has a lever thumb safe-
 ty on the right side

   also the  remington caliber
 is not the same as the - which
 was first made by winchester and
 the remington will not shoot the

 were of  grains and i believe
 the - is the only caliber of
 this weight bullet the picture
 shows nick carrying a rifle that
 looks like a savage which is a
 hammerless rifle while the win-
 chester has a hammer capable of
 being put at half-cock with the
 thumb on the hammer anyhow
 the gun in the picture looks like a
 savage from the fore-end i have
 never seen a winchester with a
 fore-end of this shape

   ask any good rifleman how much
 chance a crack shot would have of
 hitting a spotlight at night from a
 bobbing boat at five hundred yards
 unless he had time to elevate the
 sights he sure was a miracle man
 if he could hold over enough to
 compensate for the drop of the bul-
 let

   these rifles usually come from
 the factory zeroed at two hundred
 yards or maybe less a man has to
 know something about shooting at
 long range and sighting also the
 remington cartridge in one load
 has the same ballistics as the -
 winchester though a different
 case as i have stated this cart-
 ridge drops from one hundred
 yards zero  inches at three
 hundred yards and lord knows
 what at five hundred yards prob-
 ably the gun would have to be
 pointed as high as a several-story
 building to carry this far they
 dont give the figures for five hun-
 dred yards

    the very best  caliber we have
  today is the  magnum with
  much more velocity than the 
  caliber remington the  mag-
  num is zeroed at two hundred yards
  and drops sixty-five inches at five
  hundred yards with no change of
  sight setting from your zero so
  you can see it would require con-
  siderable elevation on the sight-
  setting for the  remington-
  more than anyone could hold over
  the target by guesswork

    in street of swords the author
  speaks of downing a buck with an
  old smooth-bore rifle it must have
  been a musket a gun is not a rifle
  unless it has a rifled barrel of
  course it could have been changed
  from a rifle to a smooth-bore if
  there had been any rifles made at
  the time this story took place

why cant-
  you write

fts much simpler than you think

 since finishing your
 course i have sold arti-
 cles to the n y times
 central press assn and
 various magazines my
 writing netted me over
  my first year and
 almost  the first six
 months this year writ-
 ing as a career has
 always been my wish
 now thanks to the
 nia course it is be-
 coming a reality de-
 spite a serious physical
 handicap i took sick
 with infantile paralysis
 in  i am now
 making my living by
 writing - andreas
 dorpalen  w th
 st new york city

 after graduating from
 nia i became news
 correspondent for the
 new orleans states and
 the morning paper the
 times-picayune  re-
 ceived top space rates
 from both papers i
 have already netted
  and proved by
 actual experience that
 nia instruction is as-
 toundingly efficient and
 accurate in charting the
 course of aspiring writ-
 ers-mrs d b turn-
 bull  esplanade
 ave new orleans la

 so many people with the germ of writing in them simply cant get
     started they suffer from inertia or they set up imaginary barriers
     to taking the first step

 many are convinced the field is confined to persons gifted with a genius
 for writing

 few realize that the great bulk of commercial writing is done by so-called
 unknowns

 not only do these thousands of men and women produce most of the
 fiction published but countless articles on business affairs social matters
 domestic science etc as well

 such material is in constant demand by editors every week thousands
 of checks for    and more go out to writers whose latent
 ability was perhaps no greater than yours

the practical method

 newspaper work demonstrates that the way to learn to write is by writ-
 ing newspaper copy desk editors waste no time on theories or ancient
 classics the story is the thing every copy cub goes through the course
 of practical criticism-a training that turns out more successful authors
 than any other experience

 that is why newspaper institute of america bases its writing instruction
 on the copy desk method it starts and keeps you writing in your own
 home on your own time and upon the very same kind of actual assign-
 ments given daily to metropolitan reporters thus you learn by doing not
 by studying the individual styles of model authors

 each week your work is analyzed constructively by practical newspaper
 men gradually they help to clarify your own
 distinctive style writing soon becomes easy absorb-
 ing profitable too as you gain the professional
 touch that gets your material accepted by editors

 above all you see constant progress week by week
 as your faults are corrected and your writing ability
 grows

    have you natural ability

 or not you have natural talent for writing it will
