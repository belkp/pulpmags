  you poor kid didnt you get that awful scar during
your engagement

 no hon it was while we were away on our honey-
moon
entre

maxie had a bad case of the jitters he
couldnt keep his mind or his hands
still well nobody would worry much about
his mind keeping still but it was important
that maxie keep his hands still he was
a dentist	  

  and rita rjan was the cause of all the
trouble she had cornc to work as maxies
nurse the week before a blonde eyeful of
sweet curves and soft skin but was she cold
every time maxie touched her hand acci-
dentally on purpose his own almost froze
rita was very businesslike and efficient
who wants a blonde to be businesslike and
efficient-especially a blonde with curves and
skin

	 

 at night it was particularly hard for
maxie all day at least he had her presence
to comfort him sometimes she even went
so far as to smile and once her dress
caught in the filing cabinet and maxie got
a glimpse of peach flesh above the top of
her stocking and between the bottom of her
panties the patient on the chair at that
moment got an awful jab in the jaw

	 

  when maxie tried to sleep it was terrible
he couldnt think of anything but rita he
would hug the pillow to him passionately
pretending that it was rita but what kind
of comfort can a man get from a pillow
maxie threw it from him in disgust and

nous

paced the floor thinking wild fantastic things
about himself and the blonde

  

  our hero began to lose weight he lost
his pep and spirit he walked around like
a sick man he didnt want to go places
and do things he simply wanted rita and
when a man makes up his mind that he
wants a certain femme and that femme only
why the queen of sheba wouldnt fill the
bill a friend invited maxie to join him
on a wild party but he refused and dragged
himself home alone on the way home he
bought a handful of magazines he took
these to bed with him and tried to read
one after another he discarded the books
until a story finally held him

	 

 held him nothing this one almost
knocked him out of bed it put him to
sleep with the swellest dreams of rita the
next day when he went out to lunch he left
the magazine open on his desk when rita
sat down as she would in his absence she
couldnt help reading the story she did

	 

  that afternoon while working on a patient
maxie touched ritas hand and found it
piping hot and that evening-well that
story in pep stories certainly cured
maxie of the jitters and now he and rita
read it from cover to cover every month
you should too

stripping

ive stripped myself for
    bathing

and stripped myself for
    sleep

ive stripped myself for
swimming
in a forest pool so deep

ive stripped myself for buyers
and donned filmy lingerie
ive stripped myself for artists
and posed au negligee


by virginia maxwell

ive stripped myself for
   money

   they took photos by the
   ton

ive stripped when i lost at
    poker

    thinking it strange i never
    won

ive stripped a million times i
    guess

  but this strip will thrill me too
when youre with me on our wed-
ding night
and i strip myself for you


w aiting
  for a

thrill

  by c s montanye

because cynthia jerris was
born on july fourth her
playmates called her pun-
kie that was when she was
seven the name stuck at nine-
teen when she made her debut
got tight for the fiftieth time and
celebrated the anniversary when
she was all speed and sparkle and

was cynthia to those who met her
for the first time she still re-
mained punkie to the old crowd

  all her life she had been slight-
ly batty she did the craziest
things for no good reason at all

for example when she was a kid
punkie was fascinated by the
strange tattoo designs on the hairy
chest of tony the family ice man
tony had the figure of a turkish
dancing girl spread all over hia

                               


waiting for a thrill

chest when he breathed deeply
the girl wiggled and oscillated it
was a beguiling sight to the nine-
year old punkie she made in-
quiries as to where such art might
be obtained and learned that for
two or three dollars an elderly
german whose trade was almost
exclusively nautical might be pre-
vailed upon to exercise his skill

  punkie with six dollars in her
dime bank used a button hook
to fish out thirty ten cent pieces
with the tattoo artists address in
hand she stopped at his studio one
afternoon when her class at the
mayfair school was dismissed
she stated her wants clearly and
precisely

  und does your mudder know
about dis the german inquired
in his best brogue nefer do i
vork mit out der bermission uf
der gut barents

  punkie lied like a trooper and
displayed her thirty dimes the
sight of them so shiny and new
completely overcame teutonic
scruples the german requested
the details mumbling in his beard
when punkie stated her wants

  listen he said himmel
to do dot you vill haf to get un-
dressed to der vaist yet

 pm ready punkie said
promptly

the artist muttered some more
bud he protested it aind
nice for a frauline like you to get
undressed before a man like me
ach

  punkie smiled

  how about adam and eve
she asked brightly

  he didnt have any answer to
that and with another look at the

dimes set to work when punkie
pulled off blouse underwaist and
cute little shirt the tattoo needles
hurt but she bore up bravely
when the job was finished punkie
had the slim tree of life growing
up from her tummy there were
beautiful leaves on it and when
she took deep breaths the leaves
trembled just like the ice mans
dancing girl

  when her own personal maid
saw it she fainted punkies
mother had hysterics her father
did a number of things he tried
to have the german artist arrested
and the tree of life erased how-
ever the work had been well done
and the jerris family physician
shook his head and advised leav-
ing it alone so the art work re-
mained with its trembling leaves
while punkie turned the mark of
nineteen

  in a way putting on a waitress
uniform and together with ten
other debutantes waiting on the
tables at the charity dinner given
for the unemployed relief at the
hotel st leigh was as crazy as
the tattoo inspiration but pun-
kie didnt find that out until later
she made a charming waitress
her lustrous midnight hair enor-
mous black eyes and cream olive
complexion were only a few of
her attractions the abbreviated
little quaker costume she wore
brought out to advantage ripe
rounded little breasts that asserted
themselves impudently against the
tight bosom of the dress which
further down clung snugly to her
small boyish hips the skirt was
very short so that her gleaming
silken knees and slender calves
phone me at the hotel when youve got everything ready
for the camerahe warned

were pretty much in evidence
she looked good

  the only trouble was it was no
cinch juggling a half dozen soup
plates at the same time and
punkie never knew there was so
much roast beef and mashed po-
tatoes in the world she lugged
roast beef and mashed potatoes
until she was confident the next
day would find her a strict vege-
tarian

  eventually all things do the

charity dinner ended punkie
was so tired that her good right
arm drooped like a damp sponge
she had barely enough strength
to take an elevator to the street
and hunt up a taxicab

  she still wore the waitress en-
semble under a topcoat that swung
open while she waited for a cab
to come along punkie was con-
scious of the rather keen regard
supplied by a young man who
watched her from the comer fin-

                               


waiting for a thrill

wilmerding and sandy page the
two rivals for punkies love

ally he approached her
and said

  how would you like
to earn a hundred dol-
lars

  punkie looked at him

he was a very aristocratic
appearing person with the
profile of a codfish and
slightly popped eyes he
had more nose than was
absolutely necessary or
legal and a smile as cheer-
ful as a rainy january
afternoon

 dont annoy me

punkie requested look
up your keeper and have
him take you home if you dont
somebody will come along and
think youre serious

  i am serious he said with
another slant at the uniform im
willing to pay you a hundred dol-
lars for doing me a favor if
youll spare me a minute ill ex-
plain

  not interested punkie de-
clared briefly

  look here he went on catch-
ing her arm youve got to
listen youre the spittin image
of cynthia jerris the society girl
and as such youre going to hear
me be sensible i have no wish
to defile or seduce you this is
purely a business proposition on
account of your resemblance to
the young lady i mentioned
punkie stared harder she had
been mistaken for many things in
her career but never had she been
bribed to impersonate herself it
was the uniform of course the
aristocratic youth thought she was
a working girl who looked like a

society deb it was all so funny
that punkie had a job controlling
ribald mirth

  so i look like some society
dame she said getting real
slangy what about it

  the youth raised a finger and a
sixteen cylinder hafadac came
drifting down to the curb a
chauffeur opened the door and the
young gentleman followed punkie
and his nose into the tonneau

  now he began after telling
the beautifully dressed chauffeur
to drive around central park ill
explain first my name is elmer
wilmerding im from chicago
surely youve heard of wilmer-
dings winsome bacons and hams
thats my father weve taken a
duplex apartment on park ave-
nue and weve met some perfectly
charming people in fact i like
all of them except a certain snob
her own tattoo reminded her of
the time when shed been so
attracted by the figure on the
iceman s chest

by the name of sanford
page

 punkie suppressed a
smile she knew sandy
page slightly she had
met him once or twice at
various important social
functions page was some
guy in addition to being
worth a million and a half he
played perfect polo at westbury
and was a butterfly along the
glittering length of broadway
punkie remembered page as a
handsome devil with a fascinat-
ing personality and a whimsical
humorous line most entertaining

  she trailed a glance at elmer
wilmerding like fog the plot
began to thicken

  why dont you like mr-the
person youre talking about
wilmerding coughed

 were both members of the
royal club and more than once
this sanford page has made me

the butt of his coarse comedy
he continually finds mirth in the
fact i come from chicago and
that my family are meat-packers
there in fact ive become mighty
tired of it for some time ive
been looking for a chance to make
an utter fool of page and repay
him in his own coin the instant
i saw you i began to realize how
it could be done

 how

  wilmerding made a gesture

  simply page is down at his
place at pilot light on long
island hes giving a house party
whats to prevent you from crash-

                               
ing it as the miss
cynthia jerris i
spoke of i could
have reporters and
camera men ready
to expose the hoax
at a given time
think of the sensa-
tion it would create
in society circles
and pages humilia-
tion upon learning
that instead of a
society girl he was
entertaining a wait-
ress 

  yes think of
it punkie echoed
you think of it
while i get out and
walk home

  wait fll give
you two hundred
dollars really
your resemblance is
so amazing that i
cannot let you go
two hundred dol-
lars my good girl
think of all the
weeks you have to
work to earn that
much

  you think-
punkie began and
stopped

  all at once she
began to feel inter-
ested cocktail par-
ties chasing around

there came a loud knock
on the door just as punkie
pushed the dresser
against it


with a gang of half-wits and sibilities she had taken an ex-
liquoring up to the kings ad- treme dislike to the chicago
miration had left her jaded and bacon manufacturers offspring
a good deal bored wilmerd- it was a case of hate at first sight
ings idea punkie saw had pos- yet she felt that if she could get

                                                                       


waiting for a thrill

a laugh out of it it would be worth
while

  ill do it for five hundred dol-
lars punkie said and not a
quarter cheaper

  wilmerding patted her arm
fine perfectly great whats
your name my good girl

  im not good and im not your
girl punkie told him stiffly my
name is mary obrien sir im
mr and mrs obriens daugh-
ter

  now mary wilmerding re-
sumed youd better call up your
family and tell them you wont be
home for several days tell them
anything plausible remember
im paying you five hundred dol-
lars that ought to make you in-
vent a good excuse

  tell your chauffeur to stop at
a drugstore and ill phone
punkie replied

  she called up
the jerris town
house her
mother was in
paris and her
father fishing
in florida all
punkie did was
get hold of
austin the
butler and tell
him that she was off on another
week-end party

  then she climbed back into
wilmerdings car and he took her
to a talksoftly where he ordered a
couple of drinks and went into
deeper details concerning the plot
punkie absorbed it all and said
she was ready to be his accom-
plice and tool but all the time
she was thinking how she could

get away with it down at pilot
light she would have to change
her appearance somehow there
would be people there that she
might know and who might know
her

  youre a nice girl mary
elmer wilmerding told her after
his third shot of gin and green
lime you get this revenge for
me and ill do something big for
you how would you like to have
an apartment of your own some-
where and a pearl necklace
oh id love it punkie said
wilmerding made a magnifi-
cent gesture

  i wouldnt be surprised if you
got both some people think im
stingy but im not come finish
your drink and then im taking
you up to park avenue you can
sleep in my sisters room to-
night shes a-
way at school
in virginia to-
morrow morn-
ing ill take
you shopping
for the kind of
an evening
gown miss
jerris would
wear

                   that pun-
kie said will be just too lovely
for words

  the apartment was the type a
chicago meat-dealer could be ex-
pected to have queen ann tu-
dor and colonial furniture gave
each other a pushing around the
place dripped with servants pun-
kie spent the night in a strange
bed between real linen sheets

  she gave up all the
nice peppy things that
other men offered her
until she discovered
that her boy friend
was---

to wish that she hadnt
taken goeffrey dales
protests so all - fired
seriously she remem-
bered the arguments
shed had with dale

  a girl cant be
prudish and make a
success on broadway
she had protested

  goeffrey dale waved
the argument aside i
want you for myself i
dont want every yokel
from up-state staring at
your bare body

let me out of herel she yelled but his arms
held her prisoneri

  but-it means more salary for
me susan said

  goeffrey dale flushed thats
right-rub it in just because the
market hit me hard and i cant
afford to marry you right now-
i dont mean it that way goef-
frey dear susan answered soft-
ly and i dont mind waiting
until you feel you can afford for
us to get married

  all right then quit think-
ing about going bare on the
stage dale replied huffily

  susan dimpled anything to
please you dear she replied
but secretly she had wondered
what particular harm there would
be in exposing her dainty girlish
charms in the big tableau finale
of the show the manager had
offered her ten dollars more a
week to take off the lacy silken
brassiere of her costume and sub-
stitute a string of very small
beads

  that night the manager called
her all set for your new cos-
tume i want you to appear in
it for tomorrows matinee he
said

  susan shook her head i-im
afraid i cant do it

  the manager smiled sourly at
her its your funeral sister
he said with finality you dont
possess anything that i cant get
in equal quantity from some of
the other girls theyre all will-
ing to display as much of the skin
you mustnt touch as i want em
to-because they want that extra
salary but for the sake of dis-
cipline ill have to ask you to do
what i say-or else take your two
weeks notice

  susan took the two weeks no-
tice thats what came of being
in love with goeffrey dale dale
was middle-aged and attractive
although his eyes were a little too
close together to make him look
forthright there was something
evasive about him-but susan
couldnt see it

  the show manager stared at
her you mean youll quit

  i know where i can get a job
as cigarette girl in a night club
she answered

  the manager grinned at her
help yourself but if its any-
thing like the night clubs im
familiar with youll soon be wear-
ing a lot less than im asking you
to

  he proved to be correct too
the night club management
wanted susan to wear a costume
that didnt even include a string
of beads susan wouldnt do it
she was afraid goeffrey dale
might come in and see her con-
sequently she sold fewer cigar-
ettes in a week than the other
cigarette girl sold in one evening

  the reason was obvious enough
the other cigarette girl wore noth-
ing from her concave little tummy
northward-except the strap that
supported her tray patrons
bought from her just to have her
stand around close while they
pretended to study the selection
on the tray one chap studied so
long that he tried to chew a cigar-
ette and light up a stick of spear-
mint

  the night club hostess called
susan to task anything will
smoke when its hot she said
get a customer heated up and
what do you mean by taking all my clothes awayf susan demanded
quick get into this room ill explain later he whispered

hell smoke anything chuck
away that waist and lets see some
-er sales

  susan resigned instead and
now she was discovering that sell-
ing magazines was a tough racket
but it was the only job she could
find and the rent was due she
hadnt heard from goeffrey dale
for more than a week either

  seventeen doors slammed in
your face is enough to discourage

anybody so when susan tapped
timidly on her eighteenth door
that morning her courage had
just about all oozed away

  tt was in an apartment build-
ing and susan was on the top
floor at first she got no response
to her knock so she rapped again
louder

 the door opened a white-
faced chap who looked scared to
death stared at susan with star-




susan surrenders

tied fear-stricken blue eyes

  susan smiled sweetly would

you be interested in- she

started that was as far as she
got a look of wild relief flooded
across the white-faced mans fea-
tures he reached out grabbed
susan by the arms and dragged
her into the apartment

 susan gasped wh-what-

  the young man pawed at her
quick-let me have your dress
he hissed there was a sort of
desperation of despair in his look

  susan backed off my dud-
dud-dress she stuttered

 yes hurry up here-ill
unhook it for you he reached
around and started fumbling with
susans snap-hooks

  susan emitted a frightened little
shriek let me go she wailed
are you crazy let me out of
here

  before she had a chance to say
another word she felt strong bare
arms grapple her from behind
when she turned to face this new
attack the young man pounced
on her she fought-but two
against one gave her not a chance
in the world before her whirling
thoughts could be collected she
felt her summery frock being
yanked over her bobbed brown
hair somebody had her legs in
a clasp of iron-someone was re-
moving her shoes and stockings
suddenly she wrenched herself
free-just in time to save herself
from being divested of her final
remaining garment a pink lace
teddy

 susan opened her mouth to
scream a masculine hand closed
over her lips and choked off the
sound the young man who had

pulled her into the apartment was
holding her from behind and she
couldnt escape but susans eyes
were wide with surprise on the
other side of the room a red-
haired girl was hastily donning
susans dress hose and shoes
she was the one who had assisted
the man to make susan a pris-
oner

  susan watched fascinated and
speechless the red-haired girl
fairly threw herself into susans
captured garments then with a
last look around the red-head
dashed for a window threw it
open and made her exit down the
fire-escape

  susan felt the arms around her
relaxing she pulled free and
faced her attacker what-what
do you mean she demanded
grabbing a pillow from the ad-
jacent divan and holding it close
to her as a sort of shield

  footsteps were heard in the
hallway outside and the young
man turned even paler than hed
been before quick he whis-
pered come in here to my
studio ill explain everything
later he grabbed her by the
arm knocking the pillow from her
fingers with the same motion
then he yanked her through a
door into an adjoining room

  susans whirling brain hardly
registered the things her eyes saw
the place was an artists studio
-bare unfurnished and vast a
big skylight flooded the place with
north light and under the sky-
light stood an easel on the easel
was a canvas on which had been
sketched a figure-an undraped
figure undeniably feminine

  susans captor whispered hur-
they got such a kick out of having her close
to them that they pretended to buy her whole
stock of cigarettes

riedly in her ear that girl-
she wanted to model for me-she
and her husband live in this same
building hes terribly jealous
he refused to permit her to pose
she thought he was out of town
so she slipped up here this morn-
ing in nothing but a kimono ive

        been sketching her then
her maid phoned - said
her husband had just re-
turned and was on his
way up here looking for
her the girl couldnt escape
down the fire escape with noth-
ing on but a kimono you were
like a gift from heaven sh-h
theres her husband now he
gurgled as there came a loud im-
perative rapping on the apartment
door




susan surrenders

  whos there the young man
called weakly

  you open that door damn
you youve got my wife in
there im going to kill both of
you

  the young man faced susan
desperately get up on that
stand and pretend youre posing
he whispered in agitation then
he dashed for the front door

  susan felt like leaping out the
window and following the red-
haired girl but she couldnt
she was in the same fix the red-
head had been-she hadnt any
clothes and if she just stood
there clad only in the silk teddy
anybody seeing her might think
all sorts of things there was
only one logical thing for her to
do she got up on the modeling
dais and assumed a pose

  there was a commotion at the
door susan heard the young
man open it-and then there was
a burst of excited conversation

  wheres my wife a voice
thundered

  the young man gulped i-
i havent got your wife in here

  youre lying i know shes
here get out of my way-im
going into your studio

  susan felt herself beginning to
blush it was bad enough to have
exposed herself to the strange
young man in the apartment-
but to stand there on exhibition
before another fellow-

  the studio door crashed open
with a bang susans back was
toward the door and she stayed
that way there came a sudden
ominous pause

  susan heard the scared young

man say faintly there-thats
not your wife is it thats a
model ive engaged

  turn around and let me see
your face the newcomer rum-
bled

  susan hesitated and then
turned

  whereupon she almost col-
lapsed

  geoffrey dale she shrieked

  susan geoffrey dale whis-
pered his face gone suddenly
white

  it was dale who recovered him-
self first he assumed a bold
front susan what do you mean
posing for an artist in practically
nothing he demanded with un-
convincing bluster

  susan started to explain then
her wits returned to her sud-
denly she realized what had hap-
pened

  she faced geoffrey dale so
its you she said and youve
got the nerve to stand there and
ask me questions her eyes
flashed now i know why you
were always postponing our wed-
ding you-youre already mar-
ried 

  geoffrey dales close-set eyes
refused to meet hers he turned
i-i guess ill go he muttered

  susan watched him depart the
anger in her gaze was beginning
to turn to amusement

 the young man approached
her gee - youve saved me
from a bad situation he said ad-
miringly i-i dont know how
i can repay you

  i do susan answered with a
grin

clive could do nothing but stammer
but-but auntie alicia and i llove
each other

she drove every man mad with her beauty but she her-
self remained cold is it any wonder they called her

              the frozen flame

have been aware of it besides
fawning men were constantly re-
minding her of it

  her sensitive slightly fleshy
lips twisted into a wry little smile
as she reviewed some of her more
recent conquests all so alike
all so basically naive and child-

like when one understood them
and was able to dissect their mo-
tives 

  her mobile lips softened into
commiserating lines she could
not forbear pitying them at times
these gullible pawns in her game
whose rule was that the world

                              


a woman of many loves

owed her ease and luxury some
of them had been so ludicrously
disgruntled when they had discov-
ered finally that she had been
laughing at them behind their
backs all the time

  well in a way there had been
a sort of hectic forgetfulness an
anodyne for that gnawing pain
that assailed her heart unceasing-
ly she was known in the gay
sophisticated haunts of the con-
tinent from the riviera to vienna
as a frivolous butterfly that had
fluttered about the candle flame of
men without singeing her wings
a marvelously lovely woman who
could inspire a frenzy of love and
yet who remained as asbestos in
the fire

  la flamme glace thats what
the boulevardiers and the bon
vivants had cynically dubbed her

 the frozen flame alicia
shrugged her shapely bare gar-
denia-textured shoulders what
did it matter she had lived
luxuriously she had attained a
species of forgetfulness what
more could she expect of life

  madame is-magnifque the
little olive-skinned maid said
stepping back and crossing her
hands over her breast to em-
phasize her admiration

  alicia smiled her appreciation
and arose her slender figure
ever so slightly voluptuous with
the ripeness of maturity at breasts
hips and thighs was tightly
sheathed in shimmering black
daringly decollate a string of
huge amethysts scintillated about
her smooth throat and a broad
armlet of the same jewels en-
circled one wrist

  yes she was looking uncom-
monly radiant that night even
in the blase cafes of paris men
would turn to stare desirously at
her she wondered vaguely if the
fact that a certain diplomat friend
of hers was to take an american
acquaintance over to meet her had
inspired a more meticulously art-
ful toilette than had been her cus-
tom then she smiled crookedly
at the absurdity this man was
like all the others-beasts under
the veneer of culture

  as the diplomat suave austere
snowy-haired bowed graciously
and brushed his lips against her
hand in her reception room a lit-
tle later alicia glanced with mild
curiosity at the man who stood be-
hind him

  clive-clive gregory she
gasped so you are the ameri-
can i was to meet of all sur-
prises 

  the tone in which she uttered
the words was casual enough
masking the emotional upheaval
that was taking place in her
clive of all men

 alicia clive murmured
breathlessly you i didnt dream
-count guiseppe referred to you
only by some ridiculous title-
the frozen flame something
about alicias heart tightened as
she saw a flicker of pain flash
across his features but its
awfully good to see you again
alicia better than anything else
i expected when i came to paris
heavens its been fully five years
since weve laid eyes on each
other hasnt it

  alicia drifted through dinner
with her two guests in her huge
panelled dining room she
was re-enacting her affair
with clive five years be-
fore her mind swung back

  he had been in his senior year
at yale then and she had graced
a leggy revue they had met at
a studio party in the village the
moment her eyes had met those of
this tall serious-faced young col-
legian alicia had been aware
of something tremendous taking
place within her it was as if
part of her which had always been
held inviolate had let down tie
draw-bridge clive was charging
triumphantly over the moat that
had heretofore surrounded her
heart

  they had sat in a corner and
talked oblivious of the raucous
gaiety swirling about them for-
getting even to partake of any
more gin and orange juice after

                  that clive
had run
down to
new york
at every opportunity the month
that followed was tinted with the
rosy thralldom of love for alicia

  then a cloud had drifted over
their happiness - clives aunt
martha

  shes being stubbornly unrea-
sonable about this clive had told
alicia gloomily as they sat their
arms about each other in her
modest little apartment of
course i realize and appreciate all
the dear but narrow-minded old
dame has done for me she took
me in when i became an orphan
and reared me gave me all the
advantages her tremendous for-
tune could procure the best sort
of prep school and college social
standing and all that but in

                              

she was a gorgeous gal
and she knew it no
wonder every man she
met fell at her feet


a woman of many loves

spite of that it does seem to me
she could let me choose my own
wife she cut up terribly when i
broached the subject of marrying
you as soon as i graduate

  alicia had winced at that but
almost instantly she had become
more mother than sweetheart ca-
joling him out of his melancholy
mood

  then that terrible afternoon
when catastrophe had swooped
down upon them as they had been
wrapped tightly in each others
embrace in alicias apartment
they had just finished one of the
torchiest kisses on record when a
grim premonitory rustling had
sounded behind them and they
had swung around to behold aunt
martha herself glowering at them
in the doorway

  i knocked but you seemed too
busy to hear she had said each
word like a drop of icy water spill-
ing down alicias back it was
really my intention to speak to
you alone but since clive is here
he may as well hear what i have
to say

  alicia had felt somewhat awed
by the plump gray-haired dow-
ager smartly attired in a sym-
phony of expensive gray who
faced her so dominantly intui-
tion had warned her even then
that she would succeed in taking
clive away from her

  wont-wont you sit down
she had faltered awkwardly wip-
ing away a smudge of sugar from
her flushed cheek

  no i dont intend to stay here
that long the older woman had
said with studied insolence as she
cast a quick contemptuous glance

all about i have wonderful
plans for clive the best of train-
ing in some profession travel a
brilliant marriage what have
you to offer to compensate for the
loss of that when your pretti-
ness no longer ensnares him what
will there be left poverty-quar-
rels-hate clive my boy you
cant be such a fool as to throw
away all the advantages i can
offer you for this mad infatuation
be sensible now and give her up

  but auntie we love- clive
had begun weakly miserably

  love nonsense youll have
forgotten her in a month her
voice became steely final and
i warn you im getting tired of
this foolishness if you dont
come home with me now and
promise me not to see this schem-
ing chorus girl any more im
through with you ill cut you off
without a cent

  alicias eyes had studied clives
face keenly she had seen slowly
but unmistakably a craven fear
stealing over his handsome fea-
tures fear of the loss of the lux-
ury that pampered his flesh of the
loss of those things that would
raise him to worldly success and
she had thought that he loved her
above all things

  clives eyes had swerved around
to meet hers not squarely but
guiltily groveling in the knowl-
edge of his depravity she had
realized then the anguish of know-
ing he was lost to her

  a sudden wave of fury had
swept through her get out of
here-both of you you money-
worshippers you snobs get
out
listen here clivel she said youve been
getting drunk too darned often the next time
you touch a drop im throughi

  blinded by her scalding tears
she had tottered into her bedroom
and had slammed the door shut
upon them

  the next day she had signed a
contract with an agent who was
organizing a chorus for one of the
paris cafes

  feasting her eyes surreptitious-
ly on clive now across the gleam-
ing silverware and gorgeous floral
centerpiece she decided that the
years had only added to his virile
masculine appeal the gray eyes
had steadied become assured
could twinkle at times in a way
that betokened a keen comprehen-
sion of life and a refusal to take

it too seriously he had acquired
poise too and a sort of assured
languid grace

  alicia was secretly delighted
when the diplomat probably sens-
ing her eagerness to be alone with
clive pleaded urgent correspond-
ence that needed his attention and
left

  well have the years brought
the snob and money-worshipper
forgiveness alicia clive asked
whimsically when they were alone

  forgiveness yes but-

  alicia stopped suddenly be-
cause her voice had become un-
steady how the memory of him
had seared during those five years

                              


a woman of many loves

into what mad escapades had the
anguish of frustration driven her

  ive been in hell ever since
then alicia darling clive said
tenderly what a cad i was to
fail you so utterly but i was
young too much of a spineless
pup to know that a real man al-
lows nothing to come between him
and his mate ive longed for you
searched for you hoped that each
day might bring you back to me
and now that ive found you its
only to learn that the playboys of
europe have pinned a suggestive
nickname to you-the frozen
flame-because you incite your
lovers to madness while you your-
self remain passive cold-blood-
edly feasting on their passion

  he had risen and was pacing
the room wildly in his agitation
alicia went to him laid soothing
hands on his shoulders and gently
impelled him to sit on a divan
then her hands tightly clasping
his she seated herself beside him

  you mustnt forget clive
dear she said softly that not
only my heart but my pride also
was terribly hurt oh i wish it
could all be blotted out those
mad years but its no use grieving
over bygones i want you to be-
lieve though that no man-ever
was to me what you were there
was a shrine-yours darling-
deep within my heart that none
could enter how could it be dif-
ferent when i was loving you so
-loving you so-

  alicia my precious

  she was in his arms alicia
gave herself to him with a passion-
ate joy

  youll marry me now wont

you darling clive asked hours
later his voice was eager

  your aunt-

  shes staying in venice with
some friends for a few days clive
divulged venice bored me so
i came on ahead-thank heavens
but my aunt has nothing to do
with this its our affair darling
nothing can take you away from
me now alicia tell me youll be
my wife

  and alicia dazzled by the
glamor of the only real love she
had ever known said she would

  it is extremely doubtful if dur-
ing the next five days there could
have been found in paris any more
wildly ridiculously happy couple
than these newlyweds they spent
the days wandering about in
quaint isolated nooks and cran-
nies of the city that neither of
them would have dreamed of vis-
iting alone and at night they
were in each others arms revel-
ling in the orgy of ardor that
should flavor every genuine hon-
eymoon

  clive spent money in such a
lavish way that alicia remonstrat-
ed mildly with him his tastes
were decidedly expensive he was
an excellent judge of quality in
everything from underwear to
claret and he was satisfied only
with the best

  this trait in him caused alicia
some uneasiness clive seemed
almost to make a religion of lux-
ury although she herself loved
ease and luxury still it did not
seem wise for anyone to depend so
much on them for part of ones
happiness after all she was be-

ways said the same things and
who always came across after a
varying amount of expensive pres-
ents began to pall and then one
day he had met carl deland
carl and he had attended haryale
together

  youre looking peaked carl
told him after the greetings were
over

  feeling punk hallam ad-
mitted tired to death of this
superficial life in
new york

  tired of it

carl said aston-
i s h e d w h y
man fm raring
to go closed up
westmoreland
towers dis-
missed most of
the servants and
im up here to
lead a wild life

   not that i
can afford to lead as fast a one as
you do but 

  say said hallam i got an
idea why dont you take over
my apartment on park avenue
and all that sort of thing    save
you a lot of money and ill go
down and live in your westmore-
land towers for awhile youre
bored with your life im bored
with mine well switch for a bit
see how it turns out

  splendid carl agreed im
the last of the line down there
you know youd have the place
all to yourself suppose we
make it indefinite when either
one of us gets tired of the life
were living we can trade places
again

  slick hallam agreed and
they went to luncheon to talk
over the details carl like hal-
lam was well off

  the first night he moved into
the apartment carl from force of
habit got sleepy about ten oclock
it was about twelve oclock when
he heard a mighty banging on the
door he opened the door and
a whole mob piled into the room
all half drunk they paid no at-
tention at all to
carl but went
ahead to make
a party some-
body played the
piano some-
body else mixed
drinks hallams
japanese night
duty boy was on
the job not at
all disconcerted

               evidently
carl saw this
was the natural order of things in
hallams apartment nobody
asked him any questions he
thought it amazing how they took
things for granted in another per-
sons home

  and then later as suddenly as
they had come in someone got the
inspiration to go to somebody
elses apartment out they piled
carl who had just begun to enjoy
himself regretfully went back to
his bedroom he turned on the
light and then stared in amaze-
ment at the bed

  upon it lay what he took to be
a child so small she was and so
dainty at first he did not
recognize her she seemed so in-
nocent so like a soft little angel

just because a fellow
puts his hand down
the back of a pretty
girl to get a coin it
doesnt mean hes a
scotchman
asleep her long thick lashes
swept down over her baby face
touching her rouged cheeks her
hair was childishly awry on the
pillow she was one of those
heavenly blondes that seem im-
possible yet are

 he remembered her now she
had come in with the rest of the
party obviously the others had
forgotten her she had been
drunker than the rest had been
consumed with the heat of her ex-
cited dancing and the quantities
of liquor she had drunk had

drunkenly come off into the bed-
room thrown off her dress and
flung herself upon the bed to pass
out

  although a gentleman in every
sense of the word carl could not
help but approach and touch her
to see if she were real she was
soft as satin    firmly soft
warmly pinkly whitely hot carl
found himself boldly running his

hands over her feminine perfec-
tions appreciatively this he
realized was foul ball he de-
cided to leave the room lock her
in it for the night  so that she
wouldnt be disturbed if more
parties piled in and go to one of
the other bedrooms to sleep him-
self but before he departed he
decided that the exacting ethics of
chivalry certainly could not be so
stern as to deny him just one kiss

  he bent over to kiss her full
upon the lips and then a strange
thing happened in her sleep she
reached up her arms and locked
them firmly around his neck
drew him to her resistlessly the
fragrance of her was overpower-
ing carol took her into his arms
with a sigh that was almost a
gasp

  meanwhile back in westmore-
land towers hallam had dressed
and gone out for a walk west-
moreland towers was quite a way
out from noroke the nearest
large virginia city to it hallam
walked for half an hour over hill
and dale realizing that he was
still on the westmoreland estate
the negro cook had gotten him a
breakfast of ham eggs and bacon
he felt more than fit the air
was tremendously bracing

  at last he came to a little creek
which meandered along through
the countryside the place seemed
deserted but he heard a curious
sound as of huge trout rising at
flies he wondered if it would
not have been a wise thing to
bring along some fishing tackle
the creek was banked and hedged
in by trees reaching the shade

of a tree hallam gazed upon a
sight the like of which he had
never seen before in his life

  a young girl undraped except
for a thin silk bathing suit was
swinging from a long rope at-
tached to the limb of a tree
presently she let go of the rope
and fell with a splash into the
water below she disappeared for
a moment beneath the surface of
the water then rose and swam
lustily toward the shore once
more she grasped the rope swung
far out over the water with it
hallam decided to withdraw and
leave the child as he supposed she
was to her playing but as he
turned his back and started away
he heard her scream shrilly he
ran back and discovered that she
had somehow entangled her foot
in the rope so that when she had
let go to drop into the water she
had caught and was hanging
there in mid-air by one foot it
was a remarkable sight

 hallam ran down into the
water a little way and on a re-
turning swing of the rope caught
her as she swung back he ex-
tricated her from the rope hold-
ing her in his arms upside down
the while when he set her upon
her feet he blushed for the first
time in his life never before had
he looked into such dark brown
liquid innocent eyes never not
even in motion pictures had he
seen such fresh young beauty
she was like an image carved
from ivory so smooth and per-
fect every warm curve flawless
her wet skin seemed to shine
hallam was speechless it was
she first who recovered her
as he gazed at her fast asleep he remembered that sked been
the wildest one at the party

equanimity and could speak

  oh she exploded and sud-
denly conscious of her condition
she grabbed her towel from the
ground and covered her feminine
dainties with it but not before

hallam had noted by the ripe
womanly fullness of her exquisite
pink tipped breasts that she was
a woman in full bloom

im terribly sorry hallam
began you see i wouldnt have

                              


try it yourself

intruded only your scream   
you saved me she admitted
i never came to the pool before
it belongs to the westmoreland
tower estate and i thought that
carl the owner was away so i-
he is away hallam ex-
claimed im not carl but just
a friend of his he asked me to
take charge in his absence

  this pool is so far from every-
thing she went on and when i
was a child i used to swim that
way  so i-

  anyone as beautiful as you are
justified in displaying her per-
fections hallam said lamely
youre the most beautiful girl
ive ever seen

  well she said at last you
might as well help me dry my-
self so i can dress he rubbed
her back briskly with the towel
later he helped her to put on the
dainty pink intimate feminine
things that she led him to draped
over a bough as she dressed
she talked

  im home from school she
explained i go to college in
richmond studying art i hope
to be at least a commercial artist
someday

  you were made for a model
hallam pointed out

  perhaps she admitted but
although models may have a lot
of fun they dont make so very
much money    they just raise
a lot of whoopee and then marry
millionaires im very serious i
dont want to marry-ever i
want to be one of the new bachelor
girl types i want a life and a
career of my own you see

  its dreadful to hear you say

that hallam pointed out you
were made for love and kisses

  well cant one have love and
kisses and a career too

  well-er-yes hallam ad-
mitted only- suddenly he
changed the subject will you
have tea with me alone this after-
noon

  he saw her look at him apprais-
ingly im game enough for any-
thing she flashed back what
time shall i come hallam told
her and they parted she to go
over the hill he to go back to
westmoreland towers his pulses
leaping his mind alive with de-
licious speculations and hopes
she was a goddess nothing less
   and obviously innocent
hallam felt almost faint when he
contemplated her in memory the
exquisite quality of her soft flesh
the youthful and yet voluptu-
ously perfect contours of her full
blown woman body

  at four oclock he paced the
floor of the library at westmore-
land towers impatiently every-
thing was arranged he had told
the colored butler to serve and
then withdraw closing the door
after him not to come back again
the library was the coziest room
in the house it contained thou-
sands of books a massive ma-
hogany table and the most com-
fortable of lounges furthermore
it had only one door which was
fitted with a key and the window
looked out over the garden from
the second floor the window
was so placed that nobody could
possibly see into it

  when she arrived at ten min-
utes after continued on page

ene howard was well
aware in a way that he
was cheating but he
seemed powerless to help himself
the girl in his arms was decidedly
not his fiancee and yet he had
already kissed her several times
kisses during which the soft vir-
ginal tremor of her lips had sent a
flame of passion leaping stirringly

     

through him boy was she hot

  he had never suspected it of
vernie her ardor her daring
acceptance of stolen delights
afforded him a rapture that was
almost staggering for a girl just

she got herself into a
situation that promised
to be a pretty tight
squeeze until-

why vernier ruby
gasped what-what are
you doing in jeffs

  lets go to the green
inn and make a night of
it he suggested impulsive-
ly

  ive heard that its aw-
fully fast vernie said her
eyes wide with the tempta-
tion of his offer its bad
enough that youve kissed
me even though youre en-
gaged to ruby if she finds
out weve been to that
place shes liable to get
peeved in a big way

  aw youre just taking her
place whats a fiance between

sides youve got it coming to you
kid youve never really done
any stepping

  not that i havent wanted to
vernie confessed all right you
win but remember we both
have to be not only careful but
good also

  gene smiled smugly to himself

as he leaned over in the darkness
to give directions to the chauffeur

  the green inn was one of those
places that pays for protection
when it can be bought and takes
chances when it cannot there
one could eat drink gamble and
-well no one concerned himself
much with what took place be-
hind the closed doors of the pseu-
do-dining rooms

after her second cocktail ver-
nie didnt seem to mind much

  dont be silly gene scoffed
baby im all athrill at the idea
of being alone here with you in
this swell apartment and do you
know too much talk and not a
single kiss makes gene a mighty
discontented chap isnt there
something that can be done
before vernie could reply he
had slipped his arms about her
and had kissed her passionately
again and again even though
vernie strove to evade his lips

  have a heart she pleaded
breathlessly remember im
just a foolish little butterfly trying
to find out what makes the candle
flame so bright

  vernie you little darling
youre simply irresistible youre
maddening - adorable gene
said huskily i cant help loving
you-forgetting everything
you must think of ruby-
vernie gasped atremble in his
ardent embrace

                               


kid sister steps out

  i canti cant help it
gene said in a hoarse whisper
youre burning me up i can
only remember that youre in my
arms and that were here alone

  beyond an open door under
the amber glow of shaded lights
a perfectly appointed sleeping
room lay disclosed gene gently
but masterfully drew vernie to-
ward it

  gene-oh heavens-gene we
must come to our senses-forget
this madness- vernie breathed
in the deep throaty voice of pas-
sion

  gene halted and drew her
closer his lips pressed down on
hers with clinging intimate sup-
plication vernies soft white
arms crept up about his neck and
made a tight circle as she sagged
limply against him   

  a fleeting remorseful thought
of ruby flashed through genes
mind momentarily dulling his de-
light then he thought of the
odd chain of circumstances that
had culminated in bringing vernie
and himself into this intriguing
situation and he wondered if
after all he should combat occur-
ences that seemed to have been so
aptly prearranged

  when he had dropped in at
rubys home to carry out a
theatre engagement with her he
had been received by vernie
rubys younger sister who had
returned from boarding school
only the day before she had
positively bedazzled him

  she was small and cuddly and
blonde her hair was a bewitch-
ing mass of golden ringlets and
her eyes little sections of a sunny

venetian sky she resembled
ruby to some extent but she was
a vastly more scintillant and viva-
cious replica

  ruby was a spirituelle blonde
who seemed more interested in art
than in men-with the exception
of gene to whom she had become
engaged she maintained a studio
in the artists quarter and dabbled
there almost daily with smelly
sticky paints

  vernie had run up to gene and
kissed him with the free camara-
derie accorded to an elder sisters
beau the contact of her fresh
young lips the brushing of her
firm full young breasts against
him the subtle fragrance of
her hair all had stirred gene
strangely

  ruby asked me to tell you that
shes awfully sorry but shes lying
down with a nasty headache and
wont be able to go with you
tough luck gene had lam-
ented now ive got a whole
evening to kill some way or an-
other all alone

  well you have my sympathy
im in the same fix the most
interesting thing i can find to do
is to sit up and read a stupid novel
thats supposed to be hot vernie
added

  say misery loves company
lets you and i join forces and
go out to spread a little whoopee
oh boy im with you with
bells on vernie had accepted
eagerly after being cooped up
in that stuffy school i feel like
going to naughty places and doing
wild things

  it was thus the whole affair had
started
   can only think of one thing he whispered that youre in
  my arms and were here-all alone




kid sister steps out

  now in a strange mans apart-
ment vernie was pleading with
gene not to succumb to the mad
urge of their desire when her
arms crept caressingly about his
neck however and she sagged
limply against him gene forgot
that she was rubys younger sis-
ter forgot everything but the
heady allure of the girl in his
arms with a smothered little cry
of anticipated bliss he picked her
up in his arms and strode heavily
across the room   

  the whirring of a key in the
lock of the outer door startled
them vernie was in genes arms
at the sound of the door opening
however they both sat very still
listening intently

 you dont know how happy
youve made me by coming to my
poor place darling it was a
mans voice deep and tremulous
with emotion

  i like to do the unconven-
tional jeff you know that and
besides ive found something
lacking in gene lately hes
failed to thrill me thats why i
pretended a headache tonight so
as to come here with you i dont
know how in the world ill ever
get him to understand though
he seems a bit thick when it
comes to that both vernie and
gene caught their breath sharply

  as they recognized rubys rich
contralto drawl

  hell have to know it soon
darling for im jealous of every
moment you give him her
companion stated passionately
come let me show you the bed-
room so you can make yourself
comfortable

  the next instant the two
couples were facing each other
there was very little verbal ex-
planation for not much was
needed gene told briefly of the
incidents that had conspired to
bring him and vernie there
everything else was glaringly ob-
vious

  at the earliest opportunity that
presented itself vernie and gene
eliminated themselves from the
embarrassing situation

  ruby said i was a bit thick
precious but i have enough sense
to know one thing im wildly
desperately in love with you we
belong to one another-after to-
night lets get married baby
gene said softly once they were
in a taxi

  ive wanted you ever since i
first knew you darling i was so
jealous of ruby that i was glad
to go off to school oh gee mar-
ried to you hold me tight honey
just thinking about it is making
me dizzy

the sky liner roared across
the purple heavens like the
gray ghost of a gargantuan
bat its motors droning its propel-
lers wailing a weird song

  inside the cozy electrically-
heated cabin the male passenger
turned from his lady companion
in disgust

  well if you wont warm up
he said irritably i can get out i
suppose

     

  suit yourself replied the lady
calmly and turned away

  the man stared a moment in
silence then savagely punched a
button that opened a trapdoor in
the floor of the cabin revealing
swirling clouds of darkness below

  so long he said laconically
-and stepped through the open-
ing into space   

  a long drop-with rushing wind
in his face an empty feeling at the

the way it looks now-a fellow and a girl will never be
able to have any privacy at all

pit of his stomach then a jerk
of the ring at his belt and his par-
achute slipped from its casing with
a sharp report and streamed out
behind like a pennant the rush-
ing wind caused the chute to fill
and the speed of the mans descent
was broken by a tug as the canvas
ballooned out and filled to capaci-
ty and size

  grinning in appreciation of his
having bailed out without mishap
the man glanced aloft and
thumbed his nose at the gaunt
gray ship still pushing its prow
into the night

 go on he muttered id
rather land in a barnyard and take
my chances with a milkmaid than
hang to your skirt and get only
the cold shoulder

theres moren one
dame in this mans
world

 glancing down-
ward
dark he
that he was

earth than he had supposed and
apparently about to drop into a
town down down he went and
presently he saw the top of a build-
ing rising to meet him and the
next instant crashed through the
skylight and dropped on some-
thing soft and springy in the room
below

  ohhhhh screamed a femi-
nine voice how dare you

  the man rose to his knees
clawed his way from under a tan-
gle of rope and canvas and stared
bewilderedly about to discover
that he had landed in a ladys
bed moreover right here before
his astonished eyes was the lady
in person pale of face chatter-
ing of teeth and very much fright-

 and almost landed
beside her


love in the future

ened but-beautiful beyond the
power of words to describe

  i beg your pardon he stam-
mered im awfully sorry i
smashed your skylight and lit-
tered up your bed but it was so
dark up there i couldnt see where
i was going

  apologetically he stared at her
drinking in the beauty of her pale
face dark eyes and hair and soft-
ly gleaming flesh she was both
young and beautiful and he de-
lighted in his slow appraisal of
her charms evidently his abrupt
descent had roused her from slum-
ber for she was still attired only
in a sleeping garment-a wisp of
diaphanous silk that served only
to emphasize the glowing skin and
palpitating curves of her lovely
body

  do you mean you descended
from a plane she asked finding
her voice at last

  sure he grinned rather
unusual especially my landing in
your bed but i got fed up with
my transcontinental companion
and bailed out leaving her to fin-
ish the flight alone washburns
my name-richard washburn
im from new york

  oh-her eyes widening a
trifle in acknowledgment of the
introduction i am v a i d a
dwight 

  what a pretty name he mur-
mured do you live here is
this your home

  its my rooming house she
chuckled i occupy this one
room im close to the roof be-
cause the rent is cheaper here

  i understand he said slowly
im sorry i interrupted your

beauty sleep i apologize

  oh that doesnt matter but
i must admit you almost fright-
ened the life out of me oh say
-with sudden concern in her
tones-youre hurt

  am i

  a splinter of glass has cut
your cheek she said rising
you must let me bathe and dress
it

  oh dont bother he de-
murred its only a scratch
but she laughed and hastened to
assemble her first-aid remedies a
basin of cold water a sponge and
a bit of tape washburn watched
as she moved about the room and
he was keenly aware of her beau-
ty her sex appeal her youthful
body was a slender curving shad-
ow through the thin texture of her
gown as she leaned over him
he was conscious of a delicate per-
fume about her that made him
dizzy when she bent further
oyer he could see two pear-shaped
bits of feminine delights-pendu-
lous maddening and so desirable

  when the slight wound had
been bathed and dressed both
were visibly affected by their near-
ness and mutual magnetism the
man was breathing hard and star-
ing the girl was slightly tremu-
lous and pink

  how can i ever thank you
he murmured pressing her hands

  dont be silly she admon-
ished in low tones

  but if i had had you instead
of the other girl with me on the
transcontinental hop-

  yes she challenged

  yes he answered with con-
viction
by frank k young



she got so tight that she man-
aged to tear her gourtt off and
climb to the top of the statue

  she laughed and averted her
gaze gosh she was lovely

well he continued i hardly
think youd have permitted me to
jump from the plane anyhow
im sure i wouldnt she
whispered

  his gaze probed deep into her

  id like to awfully well she
replied caressing his cheek lightly
but    well i got into a bit of
trouble awhile ago and attracted
the attention of the police com-
missioner he disapproved of me
in a big way and ordered me to
be at home and in bed every night

soul and encouraged by the result
of his scrutiny he gathered her
tenderly into his arms

  gee vaida youre a swell
girl he whispered lets go
places and do things  get dressed
and go out with me-show me the
town wont you 

at an early hour im sort of on
probation you understand im
not supposed to enjoy the com-
panionship of men for a whole
year my case was given consid-
erable publicity and my picture
appeared in all the newspapers if
i were to go out with you tonight


love in the future

somebody would be sure to recog-
nize and report me then he
would know i had violated my
parole and id be in an awful fix
oh im sorry he said con-
tritely but of course i didnt
know the circumstances why
even my presence here might be
sufficient to queer things for you
yes it might be she admit-
ted but i dont think anybody
else knows youre here my land-
lady-the woman who owns this
building-doesnt sleep here and
mine is the only sleeping chamber
on this floor

  wouldnt it be a great lark if
-his voice was low and caressing
-i might remain here and no-
body be the wiser

  her glance was filled with elo-
quence

  but of course he hastened to
add i wouldnt want to be the
cause of making more trouble
what did you do if i may ask to
get into this jam

  oh nothing much she re-
plied modestly just got a bit
soused with a young man one
night and danced with him in the
public square he took my clothes
off a garment at a time and put
them on the statue of liberty
and i climbed to the top and broke
a bottle of booze over the ladys
head but the commissioner
didnt like it at all he laid
down some very strict rules for
me to follow and put the young
man in jail for sixty days
washburn struggled to choke
back a laugh and regarded his
companion gravely i see he
murmured then perhaps id
better go

  oh no protested vaida
please dont i-i like you and
want to become better acquainted
with you i feel rather responsi-
ble for you since you crashed
through my skylight and i could-
nt think of turning you adrift in
this strange town with no place
to go or sleep

  you mean you wish me to re-
main here all night with you he
stammered

  why not she chuckled re-
garding him frankly its the
safest place i know of were not
so likely to be discovered here as
we might be if we went out on the
street

  you darling he breathed
crushing her close to his breast
and rapturously kissing her up-
turned face

 uh-huh she murmured
dreamily i like you too
again he embraced her passion-
ately and started kissing her all
over again he had just reached
her left bare shoulder when there
was an interruption caused by the
ringing of a bell

  oh darn exclaimed the girl
petulantly youll have to wait
please while i answer the phone
swiftly she rose and moved to
the television set at one side of
the room as she lifted the re-
ceiver a light flashed on and a
mans voice was heard speaking

  miss dwight    well sor-
ry to disturb you but one of the
night patrolmen reports that he
saw a parachute descend in your
neighborhood not long ago he
has conducted a thorough investi-
gation but can discover no trace
of the aviator or his chute he
didnt think to call on you because
he was unaware you were occupy-
ing the roof apartment but it
occurred to me that the man may
have landed on the roof and been
too seriously injured to call for
assistance have you heard any
suspicious sounds during the past
fifteen or twenty minutes

  no replied vaida sweetly-
none at all i was safe in my
bed when you called

  glancing over vaidas shoulder
richard saw framed upon the
screen a picture of the interior of
the police commissioners office
and the commissioner himself a
middle-aged man with iron-gray
hair and fierce moustaches sitting
stern and erect before his desk
even as he gazed he saw the
commissioner give a start of sur-
prise and realized too late that he

had betrayed his presence in vai-
das room

  hello the commissioner was
saying you say you have seen
nothing of the young aviator
not a sign of him commis-
sioner replied vaida still more
sweetly im sure he couldnt
have descended on the roof
then who is the young man in
your room with you rasped the
angry voice

  oh good heavens gasped
vaida i forgot to disconnect
the television hes seen you
richard whatll i do

  miss dwight continued the
irascible old voice you are guilty
of misdemeanor you have dis-
obeyed my commands and broken
your parole i must insist that
you report to me in my office
within an hour and give a full

                              


love in the future

and truthful account of your re-
cent behavior do i make myself
clear  may i expect you to follow
my instructions or must i send a
man to take you into custody
oh please commissioner
begged vaida ill do whatever
you say

  very well then i shall be
expecting you    and the en-
suing silence denoted that the
connection had been broken

  did you hear what he said
whispered vaida turning tragic
eyes upon the man ive got to
go right over to his office and ex-
plain the whole thing

 never mind honey he
soothed taking her in his arms
everything will turn out all
right im going along with you
oh no i cant allow you to-
hush he said silencing her
with a kiss im the chief cause
of all this trouble my descend-
ing in your bed brought it all
about so i feel myself responsi-
ble and must insist on seeing it
through you get dressed now
like a good girl while i call a
taxi

  he saw her step behind a tall
screen in a corner of the room
and then turned to the television
set but he could scarcely keep
his mind on the business of phon-
ing so interested was he in the
slim curving silhouette that was
revealed upon the screen first
he watched her slip out of her thin
nightie and as she stood there in
all her unadorned reflected loveli-
ness he felt like grasping herein
his arms and crushing her with
his passion then in a flash he
saw her don a dancette of sheer

lacy panties so scanty that they
barely covered her hips and then
a tiny wisp of bandeau to match
shoes and stockings and short
tight-fitting satin dress completed
her outfit just as she had fin-
ished a buzzer sounded at the
door informing them that the taxi
had arrived

  all ready honey richards
called

  coming she answered and
stepped out into the room fully
attired in street clothes

  richard took her arm and to-
gether they descended in the auto-
mat into the street tenderly he
helped her to a seat inside the
waiting car then spoke a few low-
toned words to the chauffeur and
sprang in beside her the motor

put in jail for all i know

  as if entertaining a man in
your room a few minutes were a
terrible offense he chided

  it isnt just that she said
wisely its the fact that i dis-
obeyed him you see his rigid
rules were intended as a means of
punishing me for my earlier of-
fense 

  well dont worry darling

game if you can supply the
right time the right place the
right girl and-the right kind
of giggle water i

come on ethel lets go
out on a spree and liven
tip a bit

choose your
partner

four people-two married
couples-sat in the living
room of the apartment the
four had been inseparable for
years one of the men was us-


ing the telephone 

  olympia -shorty this
is malcolm send over two bot-
tles of white satin-no im not
at home im at bills you know
bill yes the boy has been here
before he knows the place-thats
right third floor  - right
away

 malcolm hung up the phone
and turned back to the others in
the room hell be here right
away

  his wife then spoke up herb
i wish you wouldnt get anything
tonight we dont need it and
we ought to save our money we
will never save enough to buy a
house if you spend it all for gin

 the other man

burnside spoke up
then shes right

herb we dont need
anything to drink

were trying to save
for a house too

  burnsides wife in-
terrupted laughingly

as his wife rattled on
burnside turned to mal-
colms wife and held out
his hands in mock appeal
he said in a resigned

as

sure thing bill i need
some pepping up myself
right now

with dont pay any attention to
these two kill-joys herb be-
tween your wife and my husband
an evening can be very beauti-
fully spoiled all they want to
do is sit around on their hands
and save money for houses i like
to have a good time once in a
while and so do you you and i
will have a few high-balls any-
way

tone its no use ethel we can
do nothing with your husband
and my wife we will have to turn
to each other for consolation
he took her in his arms and
held her tightly to him against his
breast he placed his hands on
her hips and gave her a little
squeeze as she seemed to melt
right against him then she put
her arms up around his neck and

                               


choose your partner

pretended to sob unrestrainedly
as her body shook with presum-
able grief it made his pulses beat
faster and his blood pound against
his temples as he felt this move-
ment of hers so close the whole
thing took place in such a short
moment that neither of the other
two seemed to notice anything
they simply burst into laughter
and rushed into each others arms
as malcolm said well marilyn
you and ill have to stick together
then we twoll have a good time
together and let these two old
stodgies cry on each others
shoulders come over here and sit
with me and well seek consola-
tion and he drew her down on
to his lap   

  the door-bell rang burnside
and mrs malcolm drew apart
and burnside went to the door
he admitted a sleek looking well
dressed young man and once in-
side the apartment the young
man with a houdini flourish pro-
duced seemingly from thin air two
bottles of gin

  in the act of producing the liq-
uor his eyes darted quickly about
the room from one person to an-
other and he spoke to each one in
turn he had been there before
and he had also been to malcolms
apartment he knew all four of
them

  as he glanced at mrs burnside
sitting on malcolms lap in a
rather too comfortable position-
malcolm spoke up jocularly
dont look surprised eddie at
what you see you are gazing
upon two people who are misun-
derstood by their own respective
mates and they have turned to

each other for consolation

  as eddie hesitated malcolm
spoke to him again and dont
stand there with that expectant
look on your face either youre
not going to get any money from
me tonight i am going out of
town tomorrow and i need all the
cash that i have for expenses tell
shorty ill mail him a check for
this as soon as i get back that
will be in about four or five days
after the young man had de-
parted mrs malcolm turned to
her husband and said why
herb you didnt tell me that you
were going out of town

  it came up suddenly this af-
ternoon he answered and i
didnt get a chance to tell you un-
till just now

  mrs burnside then spoke up
well ethel is that nice i ask
you  both of us at the same time
im going to be short a husband
too bill is going on a trip and
he will be gone a week or ten days
and while hes gone i am not at
home to anyone i am not going
any place or see anyone at all i
am going to my sisters and take
a good rest why dont you go to
your mothers while herb is
gone

  i guess i will answered mrs
malcolm

  lets play bridge suggested
burnside as he came out of the
kitchen carrying two gin highballs

  arent you drinking mal-
colm asked burnside

  no hes not malcolms wife
answered and neither am i you
and marilyn can do the drinking
for our two families both houses

ot the disposal committee	 s have to put my

  the game progressed burnside	dress r

and mrs malcolm playing quiet-
ly and seriously while mrs burn-
side and malcolm grew more
light-headed and noisier with each
succeeding drink

 abruptly marilyn burnside
threw down her cards and cried

ive had enough of this its too
quiet here lets do something

go some place its early yet
only nine oclock    lets all
go out to the cotton club

maybe you two old folks
will liven up a little as
she turned to her husband

 herb malcolm jumped
up at once with thats
right lets do something

ethel lets go

 mrs malcolm turned
to burnside what shall

fer

  burnside spoke slowly

fuse to recognize either of
them as far as i am
concerned i cannot hear

they are not going to drag
me out there ive got to
get some sleep and get

of things to straighten
out before i leave tomor-
row night im leaving
on the owl for san fran-
cisco at eight oclock


choose your partner

  well im not going out there
either answered mrs malcolm
you two imps have just enough
gin in your systems to want to go
places and raise the roof well
go ahead im going to bed as
soon as you all clear out of
here

  malcolm turned to mrs burn-
side what do you say marilyn
shall you and i go let these
two old glooms get their sleep
you and ill step out  and he
ran to get her cloak laughing as
he went

  mrs malcolm turned to burn-
side let em go bill let them
get it out of their systems to-
morrow theyll feel like hell with
their headaches and well have to
take care of them

  burnside turned to mrs mal-
colm gee youre sensible
ethel i wish marilyn was more
like you we could buy a house
in no time with the money that
wed save

 as he spoke malcolm came
back into the room with his top-
coat and marilyns wraps he
heard what burnside had said to
ethel and as he kissed his wife he
turned to burnside yes and i
wish that ethel was more like
marilyn wed have more fun
then to his wife dont worry
ethel well be home early can
you trust me out with bills wife
and how about you bill

  go ahead answered bill
have a good time but dont break
your fool necks take care of my
wife shes the only wife ive got
right now and dont blame me
for tomorrows head-aches

  the three went out together

and left mrs malcolm alone in
the apartment down in the street
burnside made sure that his wife
had her key in her purse put her
in malcolms car and waved them
away from the curb then he got
in his own car and drove home
he slept soundly and stirred but
slightly when his wife came in
shortly after two oclock in the
morning

  the following morning he was
up bright and early and he was
cooking his own breakfast when
his wife called to him to bring her
some ice water he chuckled to
himself as he took her the cold
drink and asked her well did-
nt i tell you so was i right
yes bill you were right
youre always right i dont
know what id do without you   
my what a head ive got on me
this morning

  thats all right dear he an-
swered just lie around quiet to-
day and if you dont feel like
cooking dinner tonight we can eat
out ill be home earlier than
usual because i have to pack in
time to catch the owl at eight
oclock

  not many blocks away in the
malcolm apartment the same
thing was taking place except for
the changes in the parties

  herb malcolm lay in bed and
his wife ethel administered to
him with an ice pack on his head
and a cup of steaming black coffee
in her hand didnt i tell you
yes mamma you sure did
why didnt you make me stay
home oh my poor head and
i have to catch a train for san
diego at twelve
by charles harris



  he got out of bed took a cold
shower dressed took a bromo
and asked his wife to drive him
to the station

  good-bye dear

ill be back in four
or five days he
called as he ran in
under the station
parquet

  bill burnside
got home a little
after six oclock
and found his
wife in the
kitchen with
dinner almost
ready why

marilyn i
didnt expect
you to cook
this evening

i thought you
felt bad

  i feel much
better now she
answered and
the least i can do
is cook you a nice
dinner when you
are going to be
gone for a week
or more

 burnside ate
his dinner packed his
bags called a taxicab
kissed his wife and was
off to the depot

 somewhere around
eight oclock the tele-
phone rang in the
burnside apartment
and marilyn picked up
the receiver a mans
voice spoke to her are
you ready sweetheart

oh my poor
head he
moaned why
didnt you
make me stay
home last
night


choose your partner

  meet me at the usual corner in
thirty minutes she answered i
want to pack a few things

  four days later herb malcolm
and marilyn burnside were in
cottage nine at the agua cali-
ente hotel in old mexico they
had registered as h m notman
and wife she was clad in a thin
transparent negligee that revealed
more than it concealed she was
putting on stockings and each
time she bent forward to straight-
en a seam the folds of the negligee
fell apart and exposed a wide area
of pink-white satiny skin and lit-
tle rolls and folds of flesh herb
stared at her all the while she
dressed

  presently she stood up and with
her back to him stepped into a
pair of green chiffon panties lace-
trimmed and very sheer and then
imprisoned a pair of bobbing
buxom breasts in a little brassiere
that was hardly sufficient for
them she threw off the negligee
then and entirely unmindful of
herb walked over to the clothes
closet took down a dress from
its hook and slipped it over her
head

 then malcolm said wed
better be getting back sweetheart
weve had our little holiday and
our time is up

  you know best herb she an-
swered i dont want to go back
yet but if you say so im ready

  i dont want to go either he
replied but we have to be care-
ful we have been lucky so far
as long as we have been doing
this four years now we have
never even been suspected lets

not take any chances now

  youre right she said we
cant take any chances she
paused then went on you know
herb i love these occasional holi-
days with you we can blow off
steam then go back and appre-
ciate our respective spouses the
more for it but i couldnt stand
you all the time ive got to have
bill hes solid substantial he
would never go away from me
with another woman on a trip like
you do with me i dont know
what id do if i lost bill-even if
he is a big unsuspecting old
chump

  by golly marilyn youve hit
it all right thats the word
said malcolm chump i feel
the same way about ethel as you
do about bill id be lost with-
out her but shes a chump
thats what they both are just a
couple of chumps

  a train was crawling slowly
over the high sierras near truc-
kee soon it would be in nevada

  in one of the pullmans a man
and a woman sat close together
the man had his arm thrown
protectingly around the woman
and he was whispering m her pink
ear well soon be in reno dear
itll take six weeks to get our
divorces but after that well have
each other we can go back and
save our money and buy a house
and have kids    let herb and
marilyn go to mexico all they
want then if we had the money
they have spent down there in the
last four years we could buy a
house right now

  it was the two chumps

louis head barber in pauls	let me inform you that pauls

sporting barber shop was	place was located not far from

accustomed to men patrons	times square it was a rendez-

as a rule yet whenever a femi-	vous for actors and near-actors

nine patron desired his services	theatrical producers and near the-

he was equally at home with her	atrical producers bootleggers and

     
near bootleggers-in short the
successful people in every profes-
sion mingled with the near-suc-
cessful there

  louis was only thirty fur-
thermore he was the most good-
looking barber in new york and
a bachelor-not by choice but
because he supported so many
flames in different love nests he
simply couldnt afford to marry

any particular femme because he
had so many on his list get it

  to explain further louis was
so popular with several wall
street broker customers who had
slipped him swelegant street tips
at various times that he had ac-
cumulated a neat fortune be-
cause he loved the ladies he
squandered most of his neat in-
come on those fortunate ones of

                              


it never lasts

his choice and as a result he
hadnt gotten anywhere to date
from seven in the morning until
quitting time he barbered after
quitting time he became a gentle-
man about town and one who
donned elegant raiment rode in
taxicabs and tossed his dough
away wherever fancy dictated

  it was six oclock in pauls
shop paying louis his weeks
salary paul shook his head fondly
at his star barber

  i suppose remarked paul
that since this is your regular
night off and pay night i can ex-
pect you in tomorrow around
noon in your usual glued con-
dition eh the morning follow-
ing pay night is usually your
headache - and - gee - how - punk-
i-feel morning and there is no
reason to anticipate anything dif-
ferent tomorrow eh

  louis grinned rather sheep-
ishly

  well a guy must play at least
once a week boss-you know how
it is

  okay louis have a swell
time fact is i wish i was your
age and single like you myself
i cant remember the last time i
was able to escape the ball and
cable for an evening off

  there will be no handcuffing
wife in my life boss chortled
louis complacently im too
smart to fall for that wedding bell
stuff i-

  he stopped short petrified at
that precise instant in walked the
most sensational red-head louis
had ever seen in his vast experi-
ence she was no older than
eighteen at most her evening

wrap was a poiret masterpiece
the evening frock as she casually
flung the wrap on the nearest
chair revealed a figure of such
slim perfection curves and lines
that any head barber would have
slashed his customers throats in
half merely giving her side
glances in one hand was a ciga-
rette and in the other a half-
emptied silver flask of rye her
gigantic violet eyes were slightly
glazed for obvious reasons

  she tapped louis arm

  are you the boss

  louis stammered no mr
gognocci here is the boss-
she turned to paul gognocci
im natalie harrington she an-
nounced in a rather thick voice
my father disowned me an hour
ago for my wildness and im now
looking for a job as manicurist in
your deadfall how about it
mr gognocci and louis looked
at each other in gasping amaze-
ment by a blind stroke of fate
the current manicurist had quit
early that morning to be legally
merged with a bootlegger the
employment agency had not yet
sent around a suitable substitute
natalie harringtons father owned
the harrington steel corporation
and there had been enough head-
lines about her to furnish material
for all the sunday feature editions
for months to come to hire her
would be an unparalleled stroke
of luck-a break that would add
dozens of patrons to the shop
paul grabbed her at once

  can you start right away he
demanded joyfully

  tomorrow at nine sharp she
yawned and finished the rest of
my millionaire fathers just disowned me she said dizzily
and  want a manicurist job got onef

the flask in one hectic gulp its
far too late now of course-and
besides i havent had dinner yet
she turned to louis imperiously
take me to dine somewhere will
you im starved

  paul nodded quickly at his head
barber louis beamed and in-
serted her arm under his gal-
lantly he escorted her to a taxi
ten minutes later they were in
mordeaus there were intimate

little booths in mordeaus and
you could order anything from
beer to champagne

  louis pondered rapidly as she
leaned her flaming head on his
shoulder and closed her eyes his
plans for the evening hadnt in-
cluded anything unexpected like
this he had intended to visit
irma who ruled his west end
apartment of late irma was third
from the line in a burlesque house

                               


it never lasts

on the stem and usually was
through at midnight from mid-
night until noon next day she
would be all his but in com-
parison to this society beauty
peacefully asleep on his shoulder
irma was so hammy that louis
mentally eased her out of the pic-
ture at once

  furthermore if he wished to
retain his place in mr gognoccis
good graces it behooved him not
to lose sight of the delectable na-
talie even for a second when
paul had nodded at him there
had been a silent warning in his
protruding black eyes deliver
this ritzy honey safely to the shop
at nine tomorrow louis or it will
be just too bad

  well reflected louis with a
grin and a shrug fate could have
handed him a decidedly punker
break than this he would sober
up the sizzling natalie with a few
shots of black coffee show her a
nice time take her to a hotel for
the night somewhere and in the
morning paul would beam at him
in gratitude and consider him a
smart guy what could be more
kosher

  a pot of coffee however failed
to sober natalie as much as he
anticipated it merely went well
with the cocktails turtle soup
roast maryland turkey and ice
cream and that was all natalie
sleepily insisted on cognac kiim-
mel chartreuse and benedictine
after the dessert so all the good
effect of the coffee was lost

  take me to your apartment
darlin she yawned im too
languid and sleepy for words

  being well acquainted with

hotel clerks louis had no diffi-
culty whatever in obtaining a
large double room in an incan-
descent alley hostelry he didnt
even need the usual phony suit-
case though jake the desk man
evinced the utmost astonishment
at sight of his companion as louis
signed the register

  gosh said jake feebly
you certainly have promoted
yourself into a big shot louis
since when do you travel around
with society numbers of her
class

  louis tried to act as if escorting
a girl like natalie harrington into
a hotel room were small-time
stuff but made a poor stab at it
his grin of complacency would
have made a chessy cat look like
a pall-bearer having locked the
door he watched natalie remove
the wrap and fling it on the bed
then herself adjacent to it the
sheath of an evening dress slid up
as she did so and briefs of ex-
treme vividness and laciness de-
lighted his eyes not to mention
blinding white stretches of knee
and thigh

  darling she said before i
undress it would give me a pass-
ing thrill if i saw you in all your
virile manly perfection first give
me a cigarette and a drink from
the bottle you brought with you
from mordeaus and then shed
your raiment

  this certainly was not hoyle
usually when louis locked a
door on a femme it was she who
undraped herself first to give him
a preliminary caviar taste before
the feast-and he stared at her
pop-eyed
lie zcas jvezv yorks handsomest barber and every pretty girl
wanted to be a flame of his

  whats the idea he yelped
im very jaded with men she
yawned there have been so
many males in my life of late that
i bother with no candidate who
doesnt really thrill me in your
snappy gray pin stripe suit you
certainly look promising but the
burning question is - how will
thaupromise be fulfilled when you
are outside of the suit louis
oh sneered louis is that
so well if you think im going
to leap through a hoop for you
just because youre natalie har-
rington take another shot in the
arm baby no wonder your
father aired you he must have
got washed up on you plenty-
he might not have talked like

that with red spots of indignation
in his handsome face if so many
assorted liqueurs hadnt raved in
his veins he had a pretty good
opinion of himself-with reason
didnt he possess fifty grand of
his own and werent at least
five or six assorted cuties nerts
about him pah-lenty

  natalie rose and started to don
the wrap her eyes viewed him
in a most indifferent manner

  well thanks for the dinner
anyway she yawned ill be
going now there are several
other barber shops id like to try
and there is still plenty of time
because the tonsorial establish-
ments in the broadway sector do
not close until midnight mostly

                               


it never lasts

sorry you cant please me in this
little matter boy friend but no
hard feelings-

  louis stopped her just in time
another instant and she would
have turned the evening into a de-
bacle unthinkable how could he
face the outraged paul in the
morning if he let her walk out on
him paul would justly think
that his celebrated s a and it
had fizzled and that he had been
unable to hold her - and that
thought gave louis flaming pause

  okay he chirped you win
return to the bed baby and
watch me and if i do say it my-
self ill bet a shoe horn against a
cow bell youll never think of air-
ing yourself afterwards

  as the humor of the situation
suddenly struck him he gave vent
to deep chuckles nobody could
call him a poor sport or a moist
smack and hed save this ritzy
number for pauls shop remov-
ing the quart bottle from his coat
pocket and swishing out a pocket
cup at the same time he handed
them to her with a grinning bow
then a cigarette-

  she tossed the cup under the
bed disdainfully tipped the bot-
tle neck to her exquisitively cut
berry lips and a quarter of its
contents vanished down her slim
throat louis gulped by all the
sacred bulls of spain what a ca-
pacity dizzily he disrobed
first coat vest trousers and
shirt that left him in his b v
xs and silk hose with spatted
shoes he struck an attitude
clowning it with a grin he was
beginning to enjoy himself no
other baby had ever put him un-

der a preliminary x-ray like this
and the novelty of the situation
had its points-and how

  well he inquired softly
how do you like me natalie
do i qualify

  from the bed she regarded him
with critical eyes

  slowly they kindled he was
nothing if not well-built and from
the torso down especially an
apollo might have envied him

  natalie nodded approvingly
suddenly she was on her feet be-
side him and her hands roamed
over his muscles lovingly a giant
blaze grew and grew in her eyes
until they seared louis in their
heat

  magnificent she hissed sibi-
lantly just the masculine per-
fection ive been looking for dar-
ling absolutely unsurpassed

  in a blinding rush she reached
for shoulder straps the evening
dress slid off her and she stood an
inch away from him in nothing
but the sheerest of shorts and
stockings   

  if louis were masculine perfec-
tion in her eyes how much femi-
nine perfection was she in his
nature had endowed her with a
leopard grace and exquisiteness
her coral-pointed breasts the
sheer beauty of her torso the
tapering beautifully-flowing lines
of hip and thigh and leg made
him catch his breath sharply
the tigress blaze in her eyes as
her hands reached for his neck and
his lips were crushed by hers the
intensity of her passion had never
been a part of his sexy past fea-
tured though that past had been

dear mrs shane-

  i bet you must get hundreds and hun-
dreds of letters from all over the world
yours is such a great idea and id love to
become a member of the club is there
room for me im seventeen five foot
tall and weigh ninety-six pounds ive
got brown hair and blue eyes and my
principal recommendation is that ive got
loads of snap and plenty of pep

mo hie r

dear mrs shane-

  maybe all this drinking and petting is
the style but then im an old-fashioned
fellow not that i dont enjoy a good
time but night after night of drinking and
necking leaves a sour taste in your mouth
i come from a small town where the op-
portunities for making new friends are
very limited i wonder if some of the
many people who write to you would like
to write to me please dont get me
wrong mrs shane im not a crab-
just that i want more from life than a
continuous round of drunken orgies

  im twenty-four american five feet
ten inches blue eyes and i guess youd
call my hair medium

jim lenox

dear mrs shane-

  new york city is a great place all
right but when youre all alone you might


just as well be out in the desert its so
very hard to make the right kind of
friends im studying dancing in new
york and i love my work but all work
and no play can make a dull girl of kay
as well as it can make a dull one of jack

  im nineteen and of rather a shy dis-
position but what i cant express in words
i can say with the pen ill make a good
pen pal for someone will you give me
a chance to prove this

kay new york

dear mrs shane-

  do you know the old line about the
man who comes from missouri well
hes supposed to be the kind that wants to
be shown things and i want to be shown
just what your club can do ive been
reading pep stories for many years
now and i always turn to your section
with interest i like the spirit in the let-
ters of the members they seem to have
such confidence that youre going to fix
things up for them

  im twenty-six and not too bad to look
at ive got a normal disposition and im
interested in everything the normal fellow
is interested in nothing any different
about me-just an all around man are
there a couple of friends left for me

  he reached blindly for the light
switch   

  mr cognocci was in a very sour
mood next day when louis came in
it was almost midnight and the head
barber had failed to materialize hence
paul had reason to be sore

  louis had never looked such a figure of
sartorial perfection as the irritated ton-
sorial impresario glared at his erstwhile
head barber his top coat was fur-
collared unbuttoned it revealed a daz-
zling glimpse of white shirt front and
dark dinner coat a platinum-headed
walking stick was grasped in one dia-
monded hand and a jeweled cigarette
holder embraced a gold-tipped cigarette
outside mr gognocci glimpsed a limou-
sine so large and smart and impressive
with a uniformed chauffeur at the wheel
that paul almost swooned

louis grasped his hand in a cordial

grip-

  sorry to leave you boss he uttered
but theres no further reason for work-
ing i got legally sealed to natalie this
afternoon at the municipal bureau and
am now her official hubby she was only
kidding you last night when she chirped
her old gent disowned her she was all
washed up on the muggs she met in deah
old sassiety and she was looking for a
real man like me she settled half a
million on me the minute the altar chimes
boomed

  mr gognocci reeled to a scat and
feebly regarded louis

  then he forced a sick grin

youll need it you poor half-wit and
you were the oaf who said hed never get
married

  well beamed louis we all make
mistakes boss-thats why they have rub-
ber mats under cuspidors you know
how it is

  but he applied for his old position with
paul only a aveek later nevertheless
matrimony was too cramping-and na-
talie didnt find him as thrilling as the
first time he discovered so after a week
he reeled home late one night and found
a dismissal note pinned to his pillow
that was how poor louis swanky mar-
riage blew up in smoke

the comfort of his love and the re-
mainder of the ride was a sweet floating
dream to them both only when the taxi
came to a shuddering stop before a cluster
of bright lights did he take his lips from
hers or remove his arm from about her
waist then reluctantly he opened the
door and helped her alight

  uttering a startled little cry she
paused clutching his arm why rich-

wild if he finds out ive defied him by
running away she exclaimed

  the commissioner is already aware
of your intentions young woman spoke
a voice gruffly and the dark figure of a
man detached itself from the shadows and
moved forward you see i anticipated
that you might try something funny so i
instructed central to check any call you
might make within the next hour when
i learned that your gentleman friend had
ordered a taxi i radioed the officer on
the beat to follow it to its destination and
report to me when he informed me it
was headed in this direction i put two
and two together your gentleman
friend was an aviator-therefore hed be
making for the airport to take off in an-
other ship thus i was able in my
speedier car to beat you to your destina-
tion simple wasnt it-and if i do
say so a rather good nights work

  oh but commissioner broke in the
girl i-we didnt mean any harm mr
washburn just happened to fall through
my skylight in his parachute and thats
how i came to meet him we didnt
want to report to you because we-that is
we want to be married

  married ejaculated the officer
well of course if thats the case you
see my dear i merely wished to make
sure that you were being a good girl and
not ruining your reputation by foolish
pranks if your young man possesses a
good clean character and is worthy in

every way i dont see-

  well uncle bill im surprised that
you didnt recognize me when you saw
me in the televisor interrupted richard

  eh     why blast my eyes if it
isnt richard exclaimed the commis-
sioner striding forward and grasping his
nephew by the hand

  i didnt know what town i was in
till i saw your familiar face when vaida
was phoning laughed the young man
then i remembered about the mercury
stopping here

  oh gasped vaida then your
father and the commissioner-

  are brothers he finished

  well hurry and get your tickets you
young fools barked uncle bill dont
you see the mercury is about to take off

   are you one of the thousands of women who are em-
barrassed by excess fat that hangs in shapeless unsightly
masses  nothing so utterly ruins the beauty of the fem-
inine form as a large heavy bust many women find that
fat settles here becomes a flabby weight that drags down
the tissues but now x have a wonderful secret to tell you
-i want to show you how easy it is to correct this con-
dition not just another fat-reducer but something ex-
pressly for this vital need of women-to reduce the size
of the bust and to restore firm high rounded contours

firm youthful con-
tours restored as
fat goes

                                             ordinary fat-reducing methods are ineffec-

                                           simple method not only takes off fat it also
                                           tightens and firms the skin and remoulds
                                           the form you regain the smart shapeliness
                                           of the youthful figure you will be delighted

four driving herself up in her own little
sports roadster hallam was astonished
in a cute little sports ensemble with a
jaunt red hat she looked like a high
school girl he could scarcely control
himself while the butler served tea and
cakes and withdrew she sipped daintily
at the tea and then put down her cup
looking deeply into hallams eyes with a
hunger in her own that had nothing to
do with the want for material food

  hallam could not swallow anything
at last he sprang up and went around
the edge of the table he kneeled before
her upon the floor took her slim vibrant
quivering untutored little body into his
arms kneeling before her and hugging
her closely to him

  little angel he breathed somewhat
thickly i adore you i could worship
every inch of you

  ive been waiting she said calmly
years to hear something like that go
on but hallam did not waste further
words in speech he glued his lips to
hers he felt her shudder throw her-
self even more tightly against him again
and again he kissed her and with each
flattening pressure of his lips upon her
wet hot eager mouth he felt her more
and more suffused with something akin to
electricity expressed in human terms

  he kissed her eyes her cheeks buried
his face in the fragrance of her hair let
exploring hands test out the smooth warm
delights of her young body without re-
sistance or remonstrance from her

  at last he picked her up bodily in his
arms carried her across the room put her
down and leaned over her her fragrant
hands played for a moment over his mouth
then went to his hair and lost themselves
in it he could feel her heart beating
like mad against his and in the depths of
her eyes there was fright but glad fright
heedlessly he crushed her slender body
in his embrace until he knew when she
winced that he was hurting her but that
she was not minding it   

  afternoon had shaded into early eve-

she left her arms went about his neck and

she clung her lips settled hotly upon
his and clung

  please please    he begged mar-
ry me

  but i hardly know you she pro-
tested

  dont you love me he asked in
mystification

  yes    but i dont want to aban-
don all my plans right at the outset you
thrill me terribly    but you couldnt
keep on thrilling me forever id get tired
of you every woman if shes honest i
imagine must get tired of even the most
perfect lover after awhile cant we just
have our glorious days of love while youre
down here and then when you go away
youll be free and ill be free and both
of us later will have lots more of splen-
did love affairs with others    thats
life why should we especially when we
are both young tie ourselves up in matri-
mony

  thats what ive always believed
hallam admitted regretfully until i
met you now youve changed every-
thing i want you for my own for-
ever  

  sorry she said regretfully ill come
every day while im on my vacation   
but after that back to school and back
to my career and he could urge her
no further to declare herself he was
regretfully forced to let her drive on
without further assurances

  it was some time after she went that
the phone rang it was she

  oh please    she said excitedly
leave westmorland towers instantly
go back up north i forgot about the
servants all the servants over there
know all of our servants and they are
inveterate gossips some of them called
up over here and father knows i spent
the afternoon alone with you hes in-
sane with rage on his way over there
now with a shotgun get out quick

  i wont stir a step hallam said de-
fiantly

  dont be a silly motion picture hero
she said petulantly or youll ruin the
memories ill always keep of you other-
wise run thats the only sensible
thing for a young man to do under the
pep stories for april 

circumstances and dont stop until
youre back north again

  but if he knows hallam pointed
out he may harm you

  nonsense she said i have my own
fortune in my own right left me by my
mother and grandmother he cant touch
it all he can do is bawl me out and
hes done that lots of times before thats
why hes in such a rage at you-because
he cant do anything to me you must
g

  at last hallam was regretfully forced
to agree with her he started in a lei-
surely way to pack but while he was do-
ing so he heard a car stop before the
towers he looked out of a window
what he saw seemed to take all the stiff-
ness out of his knees there was a very
resolute looking man with a shotgun

  hallam sped down the back stairs fled
out the back way he had a good run-
ning start across the fields before he saw
coming behind him the figure with the
shotgun and he ran and ran until
nightfall overtook him and made his pur-
suer give up the chase

  it was two days later that hallam
walked into his park avenue apartment
carl was in bed groaning he exclaimed
as he saw hallam

  gee im glad youre back i cant
stand it any longer girls girls girls
i never can find a bed in the house that
hasnt got one under it or on it or hiding
in a closet i dont ever want to see any
more sophisticated young ladies as long
as i live and my head is splitting-this
awful new york liquor and my stom-
ach    im going to have a new one
this hideous food

  boy im sure glad youre sick of our
bargain hallam told him enthusias-
tically i dont ever want to see or hear
of an innocent girl as long as i live and
i loathe the noise crickets make and corn
bread chokes me    and that rotten
corn liquor youve got down there is poi-
sonous i dont see how you can stand
such a place

  and i dont see how you stand this

a woman of many loves

to discover there are things of the
spirit of the soul that count

   it irked her at times to realize that she
wasnt sufficient to satisfy clives every
need she was a little jealous of the fact
that in addition to her he needed to the
extent of utter unhappiness if they were
denied him a certain brand of cigarets
and wine and clothes made by one par-
ticular tailor in london

  on the sixth day of their marital bliss
aunt martha stalked in on them she
found clive seated on the chaise longue
in alicias boudoir with alicia on his lap
both were in shocking-to aunt martha
at least-undress

  i heard the rumor that you were mar-
ried to this notorious red-headed adven-
turess aunt martha sizzled but i
wont believe it until i hear it from your
own lips

  clive arose and faced his irate relative
with as much hauteur as his scanty wear-
ing apparel would permit

  you heard the truth he said firmly
once when  was hardly more than a
boy you bluffed me into acting like a cad
this time itll be different alicia and i
love each other and im going to stick to
her and i must ask you aunt martha
not to refer to my wife as an adventuress
aunt martha almost snorted adven-
turess she spat contemptuously not
call the woman the men-about-town know
as the frozen flame an adventuress
poor boy what a blind fool you are about
this woman well im giving you your
last chance clive if youre not at my
hotel by noon alone ready to go back to
new york with me im through with
you i disown you disinherit you you
can starve with your adventuress

  she turned and flounced toward the
door
pep stories for april 



  youve held the club of your money
over my head long enough aunt mar-
tha clive flung after her its time
that i became a man and worked for my
living

  aunt martha sniffed her scornful de-
rision over one fat satin-clad shoulder
before slamming the door shut behind her

  six months six months that worked
drastic changes in clive and alicia al-
though he was the one who changed the
most petulant haggard under the lash
of poverty he even became doubtful of
alicias fidelity even as he surlily ac-
cepted a livelihood from the francs she
earned by modeling for the artists in the
quartier he cast veiled but none the less
virulent innuendos about her virtue bit-
ter quarrels

  there was something that could be
nothing less than stark hatred in clives
eyes sometimes as he glared at alicia he
was like a plant that only thrives in the
sunshine and rich soil of wealth without
these he became merely rotting vegetation

  finally one afternoon when clive re-
turned to the miserable room at a cheap
little pension he found what he should
have been expecting a note pinned to one
of the pillows it read

     staying on together is becoming in-
  tolerable clive dear  cant stand
  it any longer so i am going with
  rene latour on his sketching tour
  in egypt

    good-bye-and try to forgive and
  forget	alicia

  the note stabbed clive like a white-
hot dagger he took to drinking heavily
with what money lie could scrape up
oblivious of cold and rain he would
tramp about aimlessly for hours at the
time

  one day he went to bed with a bad
cold the doctor the neighbors in the
adjoining apartments summoned soon di-
agnosed his ailment as influenza there
came a night finally when in the final
crisis his soul hovered between an earthly
and heavenly destination undecided in
which direction to take flight

  when clive opened sane conscious
eyes with the battle won for an earthly
stay he was surprised to find both alicia

cuddled his head against the softness of
her bosom

softly i wrote that just because i was
angry and wanted to hurt you your
aunt was in marseilles and i happened to
know it so i went to her instead to plead
with her to come and help us straighten
ourselves out they cabled her in the
states about your illness and the message
was relayed to her in marseilles oh
clive get well for both our sakes-clive

last word and this time it was inspired
by that good-sport part of her that un-
fortunately sometimes lay dormant

kisses for the
king

by robert leslie bellem

    he was a great ruler and
  all his subjects loved him
  except for one thing-he
  didnt want to marry any
  of the princesses they in-
  troduced to him he said
  blah to each one of them

    finally he met a girl
  and what a girl why
  hed pass up any number of
  rich but homely princesses
  for a cute little trick like
  her

   she certainly was a
 dainty dish to set before
 the king

  masterpiece in the may

waiting for a thrill

continued from page 

she retired she locked the door and
pushed the bureau in front of it

  she wasnt taking any chances with
elmer and besides he had told her he
liked her

  punkie usually arose about eleven
oclock in the yawning she jiked to
pound the pillow to the last minute
however the son of the big bacon and
ham man knockcd on her door at nine
sharp punkie remembered she had to
go shopping so she popped out of bed
slipped out of her chiffon nightie and
dressed only in her own pink satin skin
dashed into an orchid bathroom and drew
her own bath she enjoyed lolling in
the warm scented water lathering her-
self from her soft white throat down to
her ten little pink toes then she rinsed
it all off under the shower rubbed her-
self dry until her body was a glowing pink
flower and quickly dived into a lavender
satin teddy chiffon hose slippers and
dress which wilmerding had said she
would find in the closet then he smug-
gled her out and took her to childs
for breakfast

  remarkable how well eves things fit
you wilmerding said that dress is
highly becoming you look almost like
a lady in it

  thank you you overwhelm me
punkie murmured by the way what
is a lady

  wilmerding tested his plate of prunes
and blinked

  i dont know unless its a woman in
nice clothes no matter well go shop-
ping directly kill time around town and
about four shove off for pilot light
theres a little inn down there where
you can dress and stay until youre ready
to crash sandy pages place satisfac-
tory 

  yes punkie drawled but i want
my pay in advance i dont want to be
gyped if anything goes wrong tonight
nothing will go wrong because  shall
coach you carefully as for the money
i cant pay you until you buy the eve-
ning gown  will have to deduct the
price of it from the amount you are to
receive after all two hundred was my
highest offer

  punkie stared at him across her stack
of wheat cakes

  ill bet she said softly youre very
very rich you should be with that
clever financial mind of yours she
pep stories for april 



laughed ill also bet that morgan
gnashes his teeth every time he sees you
youre trying to be humorous wil-
merding said

  punkic let it go and they went shop-
ping he took her to a certain fifth
avenue establishment where stunning eve-
ning frocks were as thick as fleas at a
dog show wilmerding wanted to stick
around the fitting room when punkie
tried on some tasty numbers it was
only by threatening to call the manager
that she made him act his weight and
stay outside

  one of them fresh monkeys eh
the saleslady murmured one of them
kind who go through life with an eye
at the keyhole

  one of the kind punkie agreed
who end up hiding under beds and being
shot at by husbands returning unexpect-
edly home dont think hes a pal of
mine im just working for him

  i dont envy you the woman said
by the way did anybody ever tell you
that you look like cynthia jerris
where do i look the most like her
punkie asked with genuine curiosity

  the saleslady thought it over

  ive only seen her photograph in the
brown section of the sunday newspaper
you wear your hair differently and i
think your face is a little fuller

  the evening gown was finally selected
paid for and wrapped up by that time
it was lunch hour wilmerding dragged
her into childs again for a sixty cent
banquet there was something in his look
that made punkie frown it was a sort
of combination of leer and sneer it
blended a covetous smirk with an ogle it
failed to make elmer wilmerding any
more attractive

  you certainly did look smart in that
evening gown mary youve got a re-
markably fine figure do you know you
interest me a great deal next month
i have to go to havana i might take
you with me

  havana isnt that where they make
cigars punkic drawled oh id just

paris frolics

on sale all over for two bits

  in a beauty parlor no girl ever
went to a party without first being fixed
up youll have to advance me some
more money elmer i suppose it will
come out of my fee also say by the
time i finish this racket ill be owing
you money and all because i happen to
look like a society girl

  wilmerding left her at a beauty shop
on fifty-seventh street it was the place
punkie always went for waves washes
and the fixings the handsome adolph
took her immediately

  adolph punkie said this is a deli-
cate subject i address you on study me
carefully and tell me what you can sug-
gest to alter my appearance slightly to-
night ive been dated to make hoop-a-
dooley in case you dont know it hoop-
a-dooley means a grand toot with all
stops wide open and a foot on the gas
pedal what would you suggest to
change my looks enough to make anyone
who had seen me before just uncertain
as to whether i was really cynthia jer-
ris or-ah-mary obrien

  adolph touched the waxed tips of his
mustache he was a swell worker an
artist in his way he held a comb like a
baton and gestured expressively

  i would recommend a shade of gold
in your hair possibly a trifle more arch
to your brows a little carefully applied
shading to the lids of each eye would
help with the addition of a shadow dim-
ple to the left of the mouth where there
is no dimple at present if miss jerris
wishes-

  miss jerris does punkie said go
right ahead-shoot the works and re-
member-women and children first
when it was all over and punkie re-
garded herself in the mirror she saw she
was the same and yet oddly different her
midnight hair now contained a glimmer-
ing tawny motif adolph had waved it
a brand new way and her delicate silken
brows were shaped so her expression was
piquantly new then too the shadow
dimple engineered into her chin helped
vastly

  punkie nodded

  masterly work adolph the touch of
pure genius

  thank you miss jerris may i say
pep stories for april 



i hope your hoop-a-doolcy will be enter-
taining

  its got to be good-and it will be
punkie smiled

  when she met elmer wilmerding he
gave her a puzzled look

  my sainted aunt what have you
done to yourself you look different

  thats why beauty parlors make
money she told him serenely if a girl
wanted to look the same she wouldnt
go to one as it is you enter looking that
way and exit looking this way and all
for a few dollars in good new york
currency

  but wilmerding protested you
dont look so much like the jerris girl
now and thats why i hired you

  thats just too bad punkie mur-
mured what do you want me to do-
quit cold

  wilmerding pulled himself together

  youve got to go through with it now
ive tipped off a newspaper and theyre
sending a special reporter and camera
man down to pilot light but why-

  dont ever ask why a woman does
anything punkie advised cheerfully

  pilot light was on long islands
wealthy north shore and the little inn
wilmerding had spoken about a mile
from the pages estate wilmerding had
taken two rooms the catch in it was
there was a connecting door and all the
time punkie dressed undressed and
dressed again she had the impression wil-
merding was doing a nathan hale and
spying on her it was a disquieting feel-
ing particularly when you had a tree
of life tatooed all over your tummy and
realized the peeping tom might be an
art lover

  eventually punkie finished pulling on
her african-hued hosiery her scanty
bandeaux and new evening gown it was
the latest spanish tile tint and was a
chalice for all of her bewitching feminine
charms in it she looked more like a
million dollars than a million dollars it-
self

  cant i come in and hook you up-
or something wilmerding asked his
voice sounding suspiciously near the key-
hole
