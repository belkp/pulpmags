 shoot that left

moan cassidy had made him moan cassidy with the ceaseless advice to
shoot that left had brought him to a battle with the champion but there
came a time when the frantic cries of a heart-broken cassidy were not
enough-when the referees count climbed slowly upward-and buster

martin did not stir

complete fight novel

o ht at left buster

       the booming order came
 from one corner of the roped-
off space defying the commissions or-
der against coaching from the comer
the mouth that uttered it was the most
prominent part of a rather large red
face-a red that at the moment threat-
ened apoplexy the heavy roll-necked
sweater lettered on the back with the
name buster martin heralded the
pugilistic affiliation of the man who
wore it he shook his head disgustedly
and looked around at the news-writers
at the press table for sympathy

  look at that he moaned to the
crowd at large look at that hes
got that monkey tied up in a knot-hes

got him ready for the pay-off and hes
in there playing tag with him instead
of sockin him where itll do the most
good

  he lifted a large checkered cap off
his bald head and mopped a perspir-
ation-beaded forehead vigorously with a
large red handkerchief

  a moment later his eyes were again
following the two fighters in the ring
his face was redder and apoplexy was
a stride nearer he made clutching mo-
tions with his stubby fingers he
danced around in the limited space about
him and feinted imaginary opponents
into large and free openings he crossed
his right at the empty air to register a
mental knockout




fight stories

  around the corner of the ring the
radio announcer a smile upon his face
was telling the listening universe

  this is a laugh moan cassidy
the manager of buster martin is over
there in his corner fighting the fight for
him cassidy is a fat individual who
has managed the lightweight sensation
in all of his fights and he sure puts his
heart into his work there cassidy
with a right swing at empty space has
just succeeding in knocking the empty
air for a loop-yea boy-what a swipe
cassidy nearly took a nose dive into the
press table-oh its a great life
shoot at left buster the boom-
ing voice again swept over the ring

   inside the ropes on the resined can-
vas buster martin heard the message
he straightened up there was a grin
on his face no mistaking it-it was a
grin of pleasure he glanced at his op-
ponent for an instant looking him over 
his right arm moved forward-flashed
forward rather

  the party of the second part kid
mccabe ducked the right he thought
was about to arrive-and ran his face
smack into the left glove of buster
martin the sharp spat of the blow
could be heard all over the huge build-
ing a crimson flow started from the
nostrils of mccabe

  martin was dancing easily away-the
grin more pronounced he glanced
toward his corner and saw the same
grin on the face of moan cassidy

  yea boy stab him goofy buster
cassidy was yelping use at left
whoops-whos this guy anyway we
could lick him every night for a week
back in the ring mccabe put his
head down and bored in he was a
dangerous body-puncher low-hung
squat hard-headed cauliflower-eared
bullet-domed hairy-chested he looked
more like a heavyweight coal miner
than a lightweight boxer he was com-
ing in close his arms working from
his hips like tireless pistons

  martin danced away now and then
that lightning-like left flicked out and

smacked against the almost unprotected
face of mccabe each time it landed it
damaged that face it had one eye
closed and purple it had mccabes nose
battered flat it had mccabes lips raw
and bleeding but mccabe bored in

   still grinning martin walked into the
hulking kid he measured him care-
fully and let go a left and right to the
head they went home with a velocity
of a mules kick mccabe settled back
upon his heels and shook his head
rapidly to clear away the effect of the
punches

   up in the gallery in the dark shadows
of the roof a shrill voice screamed
down oh what a sock oh what a
sweet baby nail him buster-slap
the big boob for a row-yow-did you
see that left write him a letter bus-
ter the big hick forgets to duck-
whoopee

   buster martin in and out a gliding
phantom with a punch of a dempsey in
either hand played with his man the
whole crowd including the newspaper
men and the radio announcer knew that
he was playing with mccabe he
evaded the slower-moving kid with
ridiculous ease he hit him at will in
the clinches he tied him up in knots
usually buster had one arm free while
mccabe was completely helpless
whenever this happened martin would
tap him playfully on the back of the
head or pound him in the ribs-merely
to show him what could be done if
buster decided to do it

  the radio announcer was telling the
listeners in

   hes a nice boy this buster martin
up there in his trunks and gloves he
looks more like a sunday school kid
than a fighter who has knocked out
every good boy who has faced him
mccabe hasnt so much as mussed his
hair up yet and this is almost the end
of the second round

   martins skin is white and hes beau-
tifully formed his arms and legs have
those flat muscles that are the joy of
a trainers heart and his face is young
shoot that left

s

ana fresh-just like a school kids if
hes taken any hard knocks in the ring
game-and hes taken plenty-they dont
show he hasnt a mark on him any-
where no flat ears no flat nose-
bright eyes and a smile that kind of
makes you want to laugh with him

  every time he looks down here and
grins i have to grin back at him-his
smile is that contagious hes been
playing with mccabe all the way
through the fight dancing around him
-peppering him with straight left jabs
mixed up with a flock of hooks and
short rights that remind you of dempsey
at his best he doesnt bore in like
dempsey did-hes a boxer not a
fighter-but folks he has about the
stiffest punch in either hand that weve
ever observed in a lightweight and he
knows how to use that punch

  a couple of seconds ago he almost
flattened mccabe with a one-two to the
jaw mccabe was hurt-no doubt
about it-and martin went dancing
away hes holding mccabe now-in
a clinch a big grin on his face and he
just looked over mccabes shoulder-
down here at us-and believe it or not
he winked at us deliberately hes sure
having a lot of fun up there if appear-
ances count for anything and mccabe
doesnt seem to be bothering him at all
- bull mccabe rated as being the
toughest lightweight in the division with
the exception of the champion sailor
madden it looks as if the sailor was
due for a stormy night when he meets
this martin boy for the championship-
which he must do theres the bell
folks-turning the mike over to our
friend boston blackie for a few sec-
onds of fun

buster martin jogged to his

corner in a dancing shuffle he ig-
nored the ready stool for a moment to
look out over the house finally moan
cassidy hauled him to a sitting position
on the stool through sheer strength so
that the seconds could work on him

  nix on the towel he grinned wav-

ing away the man in front of him i
aint got a sweat up yet i aint
breathin at all

  cassidys face was anxious and omi-
nous listen buster he warned
speaking rapidly dont play with this
kid mccabe-lont play with him for
no sucker either hes too good a boy
dont make no mistake like that you
listen to old moan cassidy you go
back in there and knock his block off
in ten seconds if you can-hear dont
monkey if that bird ever cops you with
his short right to the jaw-well you re-
member phil ross-the kid that was
billed as a coming champ just before
you came up-well mccabe ruined
him forever with a right to the heart
and a short right to the jaw now ross
is out-done for dont play-please
buster-

  forget it advised buster with his
grin i can take him when  want to
what do i want to make a palooka out
of this guy for hes o k i dont
have to make a monkey out of him in
front of this gang do i let him ride
-let him go on who wants to take
his bread and butter away from him
i dont ill get him-but-

  cassidy shook his head in exasper-
ation listen boy he half shouted
that egg over there will knock you out
from under your hair the first chance
he gets he aint worried over your
bread and butter he aint worried
about nothin except a shot at sailor
madden for the title hed knock you
kickin in the first round if he could
bull mccabe-thats him you paste
him for keeps and contribute to his old
age if you want to but dont play with
him in there-get me -paste him-
stab him with at left and hook him
with the right-put out the lights-right
now these birds down here are say in
that youre givin him a ride that youre
gettin soft hearted what they say
goes a long way-them guys pull in the
money at the gate-and they got a lot
to say about your gettin a title shot
the guys in the gallery want a socker

chapter ii
the count of nine

martin shuffled forward into the
center of the ring mccabe came
out-a blue lump under his jaw where
martins sharpshooting right had caught
him in the previous round his eye
looked better his seconds had been
working on him furiously through the
minute rest his head was down bob-
bing from side to side his hands at his
hips his square jaw set in a snarl he
was shuffling forward almost like a
tank over rough ground his little
deep-set eyes were fixed  martins
face he meant danger in large letters

  martin laughed at him-at the attack
he stepped in and belted him on the
jaw with a long looping right it shook
mccabe but it didnt stop him martin
clinched and tied him up he looked
toward his own corner in the clinch
the big grin on his face and his eyelid
drooped in a wink at the worried cas-
sidy

  for answer cassidy ripped the
checkered cap from off his head threw
it down on the floor amid the cigar butts
and jumped up and down on the un-
offending headgear

  buster martin laughed outright and
pushing the lumbering mccabe away
from him stabbed him with a straight
left to the injured eye mccabe mut-
tered feelingly and charged like a mad
bull

  they were in a neutral corner with
martin close to the ropes martin liked
work at the ropes he was clever and
fast and usually he could feint a man
into any old position then duck out into

the open without being hit this time
he feinted the enraged mccabe into
leading with his left and as he did so
martin nailed him with a stiff right to
the jaw-and then it happened-but
listen to the radio announcer

  martin is trapped in a neutral cor-
ner hes grinning at mccabe mc-
cabe leads a left and martin crosses
with a right to the jaw-martin ducks
-ow mccabe starts a right for the
heart from down around his hips it
hit martin under the heart and lifted
him fairly off his feet

  martins eyes are glazed and his
mouth is hanging open-hes hurt-
badly mccabe is all over him throw-
ing punches at his jaw martin is try-
ing to cover up hes sagging at one
knee ow mccabe lands a right flush
on martins jaw-flush on the button

  martin is going down folks-hes
folding up kind of mccabe shoots
another right to the jaw as the boy is
falling-hes on the floor-martin-a
knockdown the timekeeper is count-
ing-mccabe is being waved to the far
corner of the ring the referee is lis-
tening for the timekeepers count he
takes it up at three he lifts his arm-
listen-you can hear him count-
four martin is quivering on the floor
mccabe is over in the neutral corner
glowering like a tiger that has tasted
blood he looks as if hed like to kill
the referee for keeping him off the
fallen martin

  it looks as if martin is out cold-
hes trying to struggle to his feet-his
limbs are trying to move-the referee
is still counting-seven-hear him
the boys eyes are clearing moan
cassidy is over there chewing the neck
of his sweater to ribbons-

  cassidy was moaning in agony
buster-buster-get up boy please
-for old moan-get up son dont
take it down there get up and cover
thats the lad buster-please-

  the radio announcer again

  hes struggling folks martin is
trying to get to his feet nine chants
shoot that left



the referee hes up-martins up
people-the first man who ever got up
after mccabe hit him with a short right
to the heart and jaw hes up-hes
groggy-but hes covering up and back-
ing away

  mccabe is swarming all over him
shooting punches wildly theyre most-
ly hitting martin on the head and shoul-
ders or missing him altogether hes
down again-down on one knee-taking
another count for a rest-to let his head
clear some more the round has twen-
ty seconds to go martin will use nine
of those precious seconds before he gets
up hes up-at nine his head seems
cleared hes tying mccabe up-there
you are-hes trying to grin again
mccabe is trying to tear himself away
-the bell-

martin staggered to his comer
and threw himself wearily down
upon the stool cassidy was on him in
an instant the smelling salts were
tinder busters nose a second was
rubbing his stomach muscles moan
cassidy was whispering in his ear

  i told you lad-i told you if he hit
you it was curtains buster look at
me dont never do that again-it aint
in the game dont try to carry this
bird look at him over there-glow-
erin at you hes thinkin that hes
goin to take yon next round you stay
away from him boy-stay away until
you feel yourself play for a draw
two knockdowns is bad-

  buster martins face was red and his
breathing was almost normal again a
great red welt showed beneath his heart
where mccabes plunging fist had al-
most shocked the heart into stillness a
robins egg was forming on the side of
his jaw his eyes were blazing he
seemed a fighter transformed he
leaned forward eagerly in his chair after
fifteen seconds of the minutes rest

  draw nothin he breathed in cas-
sidys ear through set teeth im go-
ing out and punch that guy through the
canvas im goin to hit him with

everything except the referee i wont
play with him this time-you watch

  the bell rang

  martin leaped half across the ring
before the echo of the gong was still
he trapped the slower moving mccabe
coming out of his own corner he set
himself his fists at a slugging position
and greeted mccabe with a solid right
to the jaw then he tore in working
both hands from underneath the spat
-spat-spat of gloves on flesh could
be heard above the roar of the crowd
he was driving jolting bruising man-
killing body punches from his knees
into mccabes mid section mccabe
tried to back away to give ground but
the furious fighting machine that was
buster martin smothered him under an
avalanche of blows and drove him to
the ropes hands working tirelessly
pumping through mccabes weak de-
fense-over-hand rights short lefts
left hooks to the jaw jolting uppercuts

  he stepped back and looked mccabe
over coolly there was no grin on his
face now it was drawn up into grim
lines-the lines of a fighter-and his
eyes were gleaming like the eyes of a
wild-cat his right flashed out the
sock as it landed jarred the newspaper
men below the ring they were for-
getting all about typewriters and news-
papers for the minute they were
watching martin-speech forgotten
cigarets forgotten-the sight of a nice
body transformed into a demon of
scientific destruction

  cassidys voice was heard again-
despite the rule against coaching use
at left buster use at left

  as if cassidys voice was the signal
martins left flashed out it tilted mc-
cabes bullet head backward a trifle
there was an almost imperceptible pause
then martins right lashed out

  it did not travel more than eight
inches it went in shoulder high land-
ing squarely on the jaw and the thud
shook even martins body mccabe
stiffened on his feet while martin
stepped back the boy did not so much


fight stories

as look back at his handiwork he de-
liberately walked away to a neutral cor-
ner and mccabe plunged face down-
ward into the resined canvass

no one was interested in the count
the referee might have counted
to a hundred and ten the seats-back
in the darkness away from the bril-
liantly-lit ring-were rocking scream-
ing yelling bellowing the men around
the press tables were standing on their
chairs gazing at mccabe on the floor
-for the first time in his life

  in the neutral corner martin waited
until he saw the referees hand rise and
fall with the tenth count then he walked
straight to his corner donned his black
and gold bathrobe and climbed through
the ropes

  the arena was in an uproar they
were shrieking his name to the high
heavens his face had lost the grim
look of concentration the grin was
also absent he looked like a serious-
faced boy who had beervnear to danger

  a surging mob of fans grabbed him
as he came down the steps from the
ring they lifted him high and danced
away with him in the direction of the
dressing rooms a police squad bat-
tered its way into the mob and rescued
him there was a look of pain on the
boys face cassidy was raving and
tearing at the shoulders of the gang that
barred him from his precious boy they
merely laughed at him

  in the dressing room with the door
barred cassidy went over the lad with
minute care he shook his head as his
hand pressed down on a soft spot be-
neath the heart that was still red from
mccabes terrific body punch there
was a peculiar softness there a
broken rib or im a bum guesser mut-
tered cassidy

  hurts like the dickens informed
buster trying to grin that bozo has
a punch like a battering ram believe
me  heard the little birdies singing
when he hit me with that right to the
heart and pounded me on the jaw i

felt like niagara falls on a big day-
going down-could hear you yellin at
me to get up-but i couldnt dont
press so hard on that rib

  the house doctor confirmed cassidys
diagnosis buster had a fractured rib
they bound him tightly about the
middle with adhesive tape before he left
the dressing room outside the fans
howled the louder when they learned
that buster had staged his great rally
with a fractured rib

  cassidy was telling him things again
dont never do nothin like that again
buster he was begging when you
was on the floor i nearly swallowed me
teeth if he had nailed you for keeps
-well thered have been two of us out
now its nothing but this madden bird
-and were the champs a little lay off
until that rib heals and a little light work
after that-and youll wake up one of
these mornings to see your name in the
papers in big type-buster martin
lightweight champion of the world
and old moan cassidy will be the hap-
piest man this side of canarsie

  buster patted the old man on the
back affectionately dont you worry
about me pop he said happily from
now on when you yell shoot at left
-im shoot in it

  they left the arena by a back en-
trance the street out in front was
filled with a wild mob of rabid fans
who wanted a look at the newest and
brightest star in the constellation of
caulifloweria

chapter iii

newsboy to contender

moan cassidy was a wise man-
ager moan knew all the tricks
of the trade and was still honest he
never cut a boy more than thirty-three
and a third and he always gave him a
square shot he never sold a leather-
pusher out in his life-merely for the
jack he could collect from the other
shoot that left



camp-and as a consequence his bank
roll was not so fat as it might have
been

  the newswriters had a habit of kid-
ding old moan cassidy whenever he
breezed into town with a new pros-
pect under one wing moan was al-
ways about to break forth with a cham-
pion of the universe up to now moan
had never watched the announcer raise
the mitt of one of his boys as the new
champion of his class and of the world
and moans fiercest and greatest ambi-
tion was to manage a champion some
day

  moan was getting old up around the
sixty mark still no champion then
he had happened upon buster martin
it was a street fight buster was em-
ployed in giving another newsboy a
tasty beating-a very tasty beating from
the standpoint of ringcraft he was
using that famous left hand with telling
effect-and exactly one minute and
twenty seconds by moans watch after
moans approach he flattened his bigger
and stronger opponent with a right cross
to the jaw it was then that moan had
stepped in

  whos trainin you lad asked
moan 

  trainin who for what demanded
the newsboy of the laughing blue eyes

  trainin you to handle your mitts
like that repeated cassidy where
are you fightin when you aint sellin
papers 

  nobodys trainin me responded
buster proudly when i hit em they
stay hit-at least they always have

  moan departed from the corner
thinking deeply next day he was
around again and the next day and for
many days after

  finally he startled the kid by offering
to get him a fight-a preliminary at one
of the clubs buster looked his amaze-
ment but it took him just as long to
accept as it did to say yes and bus-
ter martin had been launched on the
route to fame and fortune

  that first fight of busters had been

a joke buster had walked into the
ring looked at the bird in the opposite
corner grinned at cassidy moulded his
gloves over his knuckles and when the
bell rang-it was a four-round affair-
he leaped across the ring speared the
other boy with a straight left which
pushed his chin up in the air and
slammed home a right hook moan
went out front and collected sixty
bucks while buster was tying his shoe-
laces in the dressing room

  neat boy buster clean and fast no
bad habits a little too friendly and not
quite ready to finish his man until he
was hurt cassidy didnt like that very
well he tried to break buster of the
habit of carrying a man along-but
buster filled with the joy of life and
with compassion stamped all over him
never did like putting his man away
unless he had to or unless the other
fellow stung him badly and aroused that
flaming fury that was pent up within
him

  cassidy brought the boy along in
rapid strides there was very little
moan could teach him about the fight
game-that is the fighting itself bus-
ter seemed to have everything a fighter
needed-instinct he hit blocked
ducked and thought like a veteran of a
hundred ring battles cassidy merely
taught him the tricks that dirty fighters
employed in the ring to cripple an op-
ponent and then showed him how to
protect himself from such tactics

  for the most part buster fought on
the west coast during those early days
it was not until the press of the coun-
try boomed him as the coming cham-
pion that cassidy brought him to new
york and the really big time by that
time however martin had decisions
over shocky grady young hogan kid
twin green and billy edwards-
most of the good boys in his class he
was bowling them over one after an-
other with no trouble at all and with
a startling ease

  it was no wonder that sailor madden
looked over the sport pages with a new


fight stories

interest and followed the ring doings
of buster martin with a keen eye
sailor madden was the lightweight
champion of the world-and didnt care
much about such contenders as buster
martin life was too soft and money
too easy hard fights were things to
be shunned

  when madden was challenged the
first time he told cassidy to get a repu-
tation for his man-to have him beat
some one good cassidy sputtered and
mentioned edwards and hogan and
grady but spike otoole maddens
manager sneered

  get a man he advised go push
over the bull push over kid mc-
cabe after that well talk business

  so cassidy got the match with mc-
cabe and martin had knocked out the
boy maddens manager had termed a
man

cassidy was happy happy for
the boy and for himself he was
happier when the new york state box-
ing commission ordered madden to de-
fend his title against buster martin
within the next three months or to for-
feit the lightweight belt cassidy
knew that he was about to become the
manager of a champion at last because
he honestly believed that buster could
take madden the newspapers were
whooping things up and martins name
was the chief item on the sport pages

  buster martin was happy he was
a kid twenty full of fire and life he
still liked to chase after fire engines and
go to the movies up to this point
martin had never known a single girl

  cassidy had shielded him from such
temptations with practised hand al-
ways he used to tell buster lay off
the dames buster theyre bad medi-
cine for a fighter like counting the
house before you have your man put
away plenty of time for them things
when youre the champ forget the
frails until then and youll make the
grade right now anything can happen
lay off-get me

  and buster would grin and sink a
glove-padded fist into cassidys side as
a playful gesture and for a minute the
gym would be a madhouse of flying fists
and grunts and slapping blows-until
cassidys wind was gone and then hed
heave a medicine ball at the grinning
buster and stamp away down the stairs
inwardly grinning but outwardly shak-
ing his bald head cassidy had been
able to go some himself when he was
young-but this buster boy-well he
was a regular flash-a rapier-a super-
fighter

  cassidys happiness was marred a
trifle by a visit from spike otoole
cassidy knew spike of old he knew
that spike was a bad actor a tough
customer and a plain crook he knew
that he had other activities on the side
beside the management of sailor mad-
den it had worried him plenty-to
have to buck such a combination as the
otoole-madden outfit could put in the
field

  he knew several stories he knew
that sailor madden was the champion
because spike otoole had fixed the
fight that brought him the champion-
ship he knew that an innocent kid
had been sold out by his manager to
make a roman holiday for spike
otoole and sailor madden he knew
that fight had taken place in another
state where it was safe from the inves-
tigations of a regular commission-and
that while sailor madden was a hard-
hitting ugly customer in the ring he
hadnt won the title on the up-and-up
it was quite probable that he was ready
to defend it in the same way

  otoole sauntered into the lobby of
moan cassidys hotel and offered him
a big black cigar after a minute he
led him to one of the easy chairs in
the lobby and lowered his voice

  listen moan he began there
aint no use of two old friends quarrel-
ing over this coming scrap no need
for it lets fix things so that no mat-
ter what happens or who loses we win

  cassidy said nothing inside he was
shoot that left

u

boiling but prudence demanded that he
listen to the proposition

  you see went on otoole with
what was meant to be a friendly smile
this thing is too good for one show
lets have the boys meet put on an in-
teresting scrap-looks good to the
suckers-and have it a draw and then
rematch them the sailor wants to
keep his title for another year after
that hell blow it to your boy but be-
fore that they can fight one or two good
exhibitions for the dough-get me-
and were sittin pretty

   inwardly he was gloating if moan
cassidy would send his boy in there be-
lieving that sailor madden was not go-
ing to try for anything but a draw-and
if cassidy would swallow the bait-
well madden knew his oats buster
martin would not be a contender after
that night he watched cassidys face
eagerly

   cassidy was red faced lie was on
his feet looking down at otoole
spike leaped up in alarm cassidys
hands were clenched

   listen you snake hissed cassidy
you take that talk to some of your
crooked friends dont bring it here to
me i dont play that way and you
know it so the sailor wants to keep
his title for a year-eh well listen
my crooked friend buster martin will
knock him from under that title exactly
two months from today-understand
-two months from today hell be cham-
pion-and by a knockout take that
back to your bootlegging gang you
never were a manager anyhow-and
your fighter never was a fighter-he
was a crook like yourself the two
of you are too rotten to be in the fight
game which is made up for the most
part of clean boys fighting clean fights
-but your days are numbered me
laddybuck-and buster martin is the
boy that has em counted go back to
the dive on th street and tell the
sailor that he better come loaded for
bear there wont he any second fight
-not for his title

  and moan cassidy walked away
leaving spike otoole standing in the
lobby staring after him-his cigar out
-and his derby hat tilted on one side
of his head

chapter iv
throwing the boomerang

sailor maddens training quar-
ters were a haze of tobacco smoke
it hung in the air like a foul cloud and
with a reek of something stronger than
water in one corner of the room sat
the sailor himself and close to him
her ear an inch from maddens mouth
sat a blonde girl with lips a more vio-
lent red than nature had intended any
lips to be from her attitude one knew
that she was very much interested in
sailor madden from the sailors at-
titude it was very evident that he was
aware of the fact and regarded it as
nothing to be puffed up about

  spike otoole was making one of
six at the poker table which held down
the middle of the floor his black
cigar was oozing smoke as he gripped
it with his teeth bringing half a dozen
yellow-gold teeth into prominence a
brilliant diamond glittered on the third
finger of his left hand and another
nestled in the exact center of a red
necktie a checked suit much like one
observed at race tracks adorned his
person but not quite hiding the splen-
dors of a pink silk shirt he was study-
ing the cards in his hand a pile of
chips were in front of him

  pass he declared throwing his
hand i was just telling the sailor
here that its time he was tunin up for
the go with this guy martin if we ever
intend gettin in shape im try in to
get the sailor to do a little road work-
see-but hes busy wit other things
he nodded largely toward the other end
of the room where the sailor sat talk-
ing to the blonde girl

  the surly voice of the champion cut


fight stories

through the tobacco smoke you cut
your end and let me do the fightin he
suggested with heavy sarcasm you
we boys give me a pain in the neck
we do the trainin-we do the fightin
-we can lick em-come on get up
we aint hurt-blah the only thing
that tires you out is countin the dough
im gatherin for you i sock and you
collect ill start trainin when im good
and ready

  spike laughed uproariously now
thats what i been tellin them news-
paper boys im tellin them that the
sailor he dont need no conditionin
hes in shape right now how do you
know they asks me listen i tell
em i been around that boloney for
the past four years when he gets
nasty hes on tap-get me  well aint
he nasty now he glanced around
the circle for the laugh that was sure
to come he got it

  nasty laughed one of the hangers-
on-ho ho thats hot-hes always
nasty

  one of the players familiarly known
to the fraternity that frequented the
quarters of sailor madden and spike
otoole as frankie the gyp didnt
laugh instead he shocked everyone
present by raising a rasping voice
yeah hes nasty o k he better
be more than nasty or hell never have
another chance to be after that guy
martin gets started babeee what a
sock i could feel that right to the
jaw he clouted mccabe with clean up
to where i was sittin

  sailor madden frowned deeply and
pushed the girl away from him the
sailor could not bear to hear of the
fistic prowess of a rival it got under
his skin he walked across the floor
to the poker table and put the eye
on frankie

  listen you he said to the pasty-
faced youth who had remarked on
buster martins punching ability if
you think this palooka is so good why
dont you go over and hang around
where he hangs out and not mop up

the space around here huh why
dont cha-

  well i was only sayin that this
martin bird had some sock defended
frankie weakly shrinking away from
the rage in maddens eyes no of-
fense champ-just a little friendly
tip

  i dont want no friendly tips
snarled madden and im sick of see-
in your ugly mug around here get
out-and stay out gwan clear the
door lemme see space between your
feet and the floor outside bum-and
next time you want to come in call me
up-and if i want you around ill
whistle

  spike otoole nudged the boy
frankie with his elbow better beat
it he advised in a low tone better
take the air frankie get out until the
sailor is himself again you ought to
know better than to yap about that bozo
bein good at this stage of the game
gwan take the air ill tip you off
when the storm blows over

  frankie the gyp climbed to his feet
his hands were twitching

  im tired of bein the fall guy for
that cheese champion he declared in
a loud voice im tired of bein
frankie this and that one minute when
im needed and a bum the next im
tired of doin all the dirty work around
this camp-like that job on ray mitchell
-that rotten fight-and standin around
to get the rap if anything goes wrong
and then gettin no thanks from the
guys im the sucker for im through
the next time-

  sailor madden had stepped up behind
frankie he was standing close very
close and his eyes were filled with a
swirling rage he whipped his right
hand from the floor and it landed be-
hind the unknowing frankies ear with
the crack of a pistol shot frankie cut
off in his spech fell forward on his
face down like a pole-axed ox down
among the cigar and cigaret stubs and
lay quiet

  spike otoole leaped to his feet in
shoot that left



wild alarm but he was too late to pre-
vent the blow he charged angrily
down upon the raging sailor

  how do you get that way he de-
manded what do you mean by hit-
tin that guy in the back of the head
like that you big bum his voice was
shrieking what you tryin to do bust
a fin or somethin so you can run out
of this martin fight and leave me hold-
in the bag hittin a guy on the head
with your bare hand-why you aint
got thesense of a louse

  he whirled facing the group at the
poker table get that guy out of here
put him on the back steps-anywhere
ill take care of him later he con-
tinued to glare his indignation at the
sailor he cleared the whole room so
that the sailor and he were alone

  nice thing he continued when they
were all out if the commission would
find out that you had a busted hand
nice thing with that stack of jack from
the martin fight lookin us in the face-
ah get down to your weight
scoffed the sailor i could win that
fight with two broken arms aint it
in the bag -

  spike otooles eyes were narrow
slits for a moment he seemed about
to explode with wrath it may be in
the bag big boy he snarled but if
it is frankie and me told you how to
put it in the bag unnerstand im
not saying anything for frankie he
ought to have more sense but im not
goin to kiss my dough goodbye-not
the biggest take well make while youre
champion i told you how to frame
this martin guy-youre doin it i got
the brains and you drink all the rum
and do all the girl chasin listen bozo
if anything happens to gum this fight
im off you for life-see im through
well theres plenty of other guys
lookin for a soft livin hinted the
sailor i dont need to worry much
about losin no manager

  youll worry if you lose me warned
otoole youll be champ as long as
im with you and not a week longer

i made you and i can break you-and
dont you forget it his tone was
pregnant with meaning

  oh forget it offered the sailor
with his crooked-mouthed smile well
be the champs till the cows come home
come over and hear the report ive got
for you on the strict qt its a hum-
mer

together they crossed the
room sailor madden piloted to a
far corner and they stood conversing
in whispers dont let stella hear
this he warned with a nod of his head
in the direction of the blonde girl she
thinks i wouldnt look at another frail
-but this molly kid the one that thinks
im a little hero-you know the one i
met at that society jaunt that night and
gave the stall that i was a home boy
and only in the fight racket because i
had to make some rapid dough to send
to the old folks at home-molly ocon-
nor-well thats the kid ive sicked on
buster martin molly is nuts about
me tryin to reform me and all that
boloney and sister-shes gettin in
the work with martin in a way that
would knock your eye out she had
buster himself down among the white
lights until the milk wagons drove home
this morning shes one fast-working
kid

  listen warned spike tell me
im throwin cold water again-but when
i gave you that plant i didnt know
nothin about this molly girl that she
was goin to have anything to do with
the works i thought youd send stella

youll be sorry if you dont shes out
of your class entirely shes a good
girl she thinks youre somethin you

givin her a stall-well boy you better

stance-but this molly kid-well you

fight stories

announced the sailor shes working
on martin now and shes the only one
who could do it it aint my fault shes
nuts over me i met her that time and
i been meetin her ever since course
i gave her a line told her how much
i hated flightin and how i was tryin
to get enough jack together to lift the
mortgage on the old home thats a
laugh aint it if i wanted to lift a

down  th street she thinks im
in the game because i need the dough
honest every sunday she cuts want
ads out of the paper and brings em
around to me-guys wantin to hire
salesmen for this and that can you
imagine me ever being a salesman  hot
dog-thats the limit the sailor
laughed uproariously

  spike shook his head dubiously
shes a good girl he said slowly i
dont like to see no good girl taken for
a ride ive got a sister of me own
ah act your age said madden
with a slap on the back i couldnt
drive that molly woman away from me
with a bull whip she thinks im nuts
over her

  she dont know nothin about this
stella woman ill tell the cock-eyed
world or she wouldnt think so

  no admitted madden she dont
know nothin about nothin just a nice
high school kid that i smiled at say
listen when i take her out i remember
grammar and everything shes uptown
ok i put the works on for fair-no
wise cracks or nothin like that fancy
language-and the movies not like
stella there

  well whats the lay whats she
put across

  boy she fixes everything ok ill
tell the world gloated madden i tell
her to stick around the athletic club
where martin is doing his road work
does she listen she gets a tennis bat
and she rigs out and goes over there
seems like her brother or father or
somebody is a member of the joint and

she hangs around until she gets intro-
duced to the buster

  after that its coffee and doughnuts
-easy pickins she has him dated up
for every night in the week and the
buster is losin more sleep than any three
hounds on the white alley funny
thing-he keeps working days just the
same hes burnin himself out-fast
-wont be anything but a shell a month
from now when the fight comes off
why i could be punk that night and
still gallop around him fast enough to
make him fall over his own feet the
scraps in the bag this molly girl
has put in the works

  spike shook his head again dubiously
well i hope she has-we need this
fight to keep up our reputation the
fans didnt like that murray go at all
it was cold

  well can i help it if the palooka
gets the signals mixed and takes a dive
w-hen i sock him on the elbow i dont
blame the boys for gettin sore a guy
like that dont belong in the ring he
could give em their moneys worth by
lettin me hit him a decent punch-to
make it look like a ko-but he does
his dive from a punch on the elbow-
fooey

  the sailor strutted back across the
room to where the blonde girl with the
red lips was waiting what you say
kid if you and the champ step out of
here for a breath of fresh air he sug-
gested lets ankle down to the
dutchmans for a pail of the real old-
fashioned these hay-burners around
here have this place smelling like a
cabbage factory

  spike otoole watched them go
there was a queer expression on his
face

  outside frankie the gyp picked him-
self up and rubbed his swollen ear his
ears were still ringing from the dirty
punch from behind his hands were
shaking he wobbled slightly as he
stuck close to the wall and made painful
progress down the avenue in his
whirling brain he was thinking of how
shoot that left

ne could even the score with sailor
madden

chapter v
the contender skids

moan cassidy watched the lithe
form of buster martin as buster
danced about the gym punishing the
light bag he shook his head there
was a light of dismay in his eyes buster
was down too fine he looked drawn
white stretched-out he was laboring
at his training and buster had never
labored over his training before buster
was the sort of lad who could work at
an easy gait for hours at a time-
three minutes after three minutes-and
never blow hard nor show signs of
fatigue

  these days buster martin was not
working like that buster was making
training a labor his chest heaved his
muscles were becoming hard and they
were not retaining that flexible round-
ness his punch seemed to have lost
its old sharpshooting snap and certainty
his cheeks had lost much of their color
his eyes were dull and lacked the old
spirited fire of a few months past

  then too buster was becoming si-
lent almost morose he had little to
say he was not the buster who
bubbled over with animal spirits and
went about the gym taking sly pokes
at any one with a turned back

  he was training perfunctorily-as a
duty-and above all when he looked
at old moan cassidy he hada guilty
look his eyes would drop and study the
floor moan watched him throwing
punches at the heavy sandbag it seemed
an effort for the boy to throw his arms
moan called him aside

  buster came over to him a look of
half-defiance in his eyes his gloved
hands were hanging at his sides he was
breathing heavily moan went straight to
the point he was not one to beat about
the bush over anything he placed his

hands on martins shoulders and looked
him full in the eyes

  buster boy he said in a low voice
are you goin to throw old moan down
at this stage of the game you intend
making me see you get a beating that
will finish us both

  martin glanced up in surprise
whats eatin you old timer where
do you get that line he asked but
as he spoke he shifted his eyes from
moans face to the floor and stood with
his head bowed

  listen boy begged cassidy
weve been through too many things
together you and i to split up now
howsomever im going to take a chance
im going to tell them newspaper boys
that i wont stand for you goin into
the ring with sailor madden

  you what exploded martin

  just that assured cassidy i cant
stand to see you take a beating like
youll get from that bird ive always
got my heart riding in there with you
every minute im not goin to be a
party to sendin you in to a guy that
hits like trip-hammers and see you
pounded to a bloody mass just be-
cause youre out of condition and cant
get into condition in time for the
fight

  whos not in condition demanded
martin guiltily im feeling great
right now i could knock maddens
block off at this minute

  talk said cassidy disgustedly
just wind you know as well as i do
that youre not in condition you puff
around here like a steam-engine with
asthma youve lost the snap to your
punches your timing is rotten you
couldnt knock over a feather pillow
just yesterday afternoon that young
kid of farrels made a monkey out of
you when you were in there sparrin
with him because you didnt have the
legs to go after him and land him
how many miles did you do this morn-
ing

  three replied martin

  three mocked cassidy and you


fight stories

promised me to do six at least-and you
trainin to fight the champion

  oh that guy scoffed martin
yeah that guy answered moan
hotly listen he may be a crook and
lie may fight dirty and he may make
everybody believe that hes not training
-but sailor madden can hit and he
can fight like a wild cat dont forget it
he can fight-and he will

  well i was tired when i got up
defended martin

  cassidy snorted indignantly what
time did you get to bed he demanded
twelve oclock lied martin

  dont tell me that buster dont lie
to old moan begged cassidy thats
always the beginning of the end-when
a fellow starts to lie to his best pal if
you want to quit scrappin im with
you but dont lie to me youre kiddin
yourself-not me dont lie just to
make me like it-and then go in there
and take a shellacking from the sailor
thats liable to finish you that egg hits
-oh boy how he hits

  well a fellow has to have a little
fun some time growled buster ive
been a sunday school boy for years-
and now that the folks want to see me
 have to give the fans a run for their
money theyll think im another false
alarm if i dont go out some

  dont kid yourself laughed cas-
sidy bitterly i know them fans ive
been around em all my life theyre
strong for you now because you knocked
mccabe kickin the minute somebody
does the same to you theyll be off you
and on him they want action thats
what they lay their good dough down
on the line for-action if you want
to give em a run for their money let
them see you in the ring stoppin sailor
madden in two rounds

  fightins your game not giving
night clubs a dizzy whirl i looked for
you last night i do etery night kind
of a habit i guess to see that youre in
bed ok and covered up so the damp
dont get at you i looked in your bed
every half hour i waited up-im an

old fool i guess-but you didnt come
in four am buster boy-four am
when you rolled in and youre trying to
work out today-trying to kid old moan
better quit on the spot-youre only
kiddin yourself

  im tired of having you run me
around like a grandma announced
martin jts buster this and buster
that-and dont do this and thatll hurt
you-and hey you mustnt eat that-
hey put down that ice cream cone
what fun do i get out of life anyway
a guy ought to have some fun

  there was a hurt look in moan
cassidys eyes lad he quavered i
never put you on a wrong steer in my
life did   i never did nothin that
wasnt for your own good did i i
never told you a lie or held out a penny
on you or sold you out or stacked you
up against a boy that was too good for
you did i im not money greedy am
i  i never would take a chance on
your gettin hurt bad when you didnt
have no ring experience would i 

   kind of thought that we meant
more to one another than just a fighter
and his manager never had nobody
much of my own-been alone all my
life youre kind o like the kid i would
like for my own lad if i had one kinda
loved you i guess thats why i sneak
in at night to see that youre covered up
-and-im a hard old guy-but boy-
i kinda thought we was different-
specially them times when you used to
feel good and call me pop i like
that i always wished you was-most
times i think of you as son-darn ol
fool-always was-but anyway thats
me

  howsomever if you think somebody
else can do you more good why youre
free buster free as air ol popll step
right out of the picture wishin you all
the luck in the world contract or not
i couldnt hold you to no contract i
tore it up long ago i aint had no con-
tract for over two years now so youre
free if you think im doin you wrong
you know best-
shoot that left



there was a furtive tear in buster
martins eye he dashed his glove
angrily across his eyes and sniffed sus-
piciously he punched moan playfully
on the nose then threw his arms around
him listen pop he begged i
know im slippin-you dont have to
tell me-but pop shes a wonderful girl
-one in a million-and she likes me and
i like her and she likes to go out with
me i aint never met nobody like her
pop shes too good for me

  moan cassidy snorted there aint
no girl too good for a young clean-livin
and thinkin square-shootin boy like
you he said hotly a girl would
know that even if you didnt

  well she likes me went on martin
we get along swell together shes
teachin me to dance and wear a tux
and everything i feel like an awful
boob alongside of her

  does she know anything about
straight lefts and a right cross does
she know how to stagger up off a floor
like you did against kid mccabe-and
then go on to win  can she-

  she dont know anything about
fightin said buster earnestly she
thinks its all wet as a dough-getter
she says t ought to make a good bond
salesman because ive got a good per-
sonality she wants to help me find a
job-

  she what shrieked cassidy a
job say what does she think youre
makin now does she know that you
pulled down twenty thousand for four
rounds against mccabe and that youve
got enough salted away to buy a few
fancy bonds yourself 

  no i didnt tell her anything about
money admitted buster but she
thinks its a bum racket she wants me
to quit after this fight

  wiell she should want you to quit
before it stated cassidy she dont
know that youll have to quit

  what do you mean  demanded
martin

  i mean that when sailor madden
gets through hammering them soft ribs

  f-june-

of yours-well you wont never fight
no more

  ill beat him - easy predicted
martin with a swipe of his glove hell
be duck soup

  whats this girl look like de-
manded moan

  say who do you think i am-gari-
baldi or whoever that wop is that writes
all that poetry well shes about up
to my shoulder and has black hair and
eyes and the funniest tilted-up nose you
ever saw and her face is as white as
your shirt-and-oh boy can she
dance

  whats her name asked cassidy
her name is molly-molly ocon-
nor

  well theres some hope-shes irish
sighed cassidy get your shower and
lets get out of here

  martin bounded away with some of
his old-time pep to run the stinging
water over his naked flesh

      chapter vi
      the stool-pigeon

it was then that frankie the gyp ap-
proached cassidy he sidled up to
him and coughed slightly to attract
moans attention

  youre cassidy aint you  he asked
when cassidy looked around moan
cassidy what handles buster martin
cassidy surveyed the sharp features
of frankie for a long minute i am
he announced whats it to you 
you dont know me went on
frankie except maybe by reputation-
i got a bad one-and i got it from
kickin around in the same stable with
guys like sailor madden and spike
otoole they call me frankie the
gyp down  the street its a good
moniker i guess i earned it framin
other guys but right now at this min-
ute im on the level see this mark
on my jaw well the sailor hit me
there from behind when i wasnt lookin


fight stories

and dropped me on the floor like a sack
of flour because i told him he better do
some trainin for this fight

  threw me out they did out on the
back steps to lay like a dog-me
frankie thats been doin their dirty
work for three years-and they did it
for nothin now im through-get me
--out-done listen cassidy i dont
know you and i dont know this mar-
tin kid but from what ive seen of him
in the ring hes a real guy and a clean
boy i know youre a square shooter
you take a tip from frankie keep your
lamps skinned for a dame by the name
of oconnor and if you see her around
here run her off with a shotgun-
see

  cassidy looked at the gyp through
narrowed eyes whats the game he
asked he had no idea but that frankie
was playing on the level with him at the
minute the entire attitude of the
gangster was too earnest for anything
else

  listen cassidy theyve cooked up
a sweet layout for buster over there at
spikes joint-get me this oconnor
broad is nuts about the sailor thinks
hes a little tin god-goin to reform
him and all that bunk and all the time
hes givin her a phony play-see on
the side hes hanging out with a flock
of other frails the best of the lot being
a jane that answers when somebody
sings out stella-see

  well this stella is the sailors skirt
ya unnerstand but-this molly ocon-
nor thinks the office is in for her-so she
falls easy for the rackets they back
her into a neutral corner one day when
the sailor comes in from the road work
and hes groanin like he was killed he
hadnt been near no road hed been out
shootin kelly pool with the gang and
this is a stall theyre handin molly-
see hes holding his ribs and groanin
like hes dying on the spot and shes all
nervous and anxious and asks him
whats the trouble he tells her that he
fell and busted a rib-fell on a big rock
while hes runnin in the park-and now

hes sure to get a bad beatin from this
buster martin guy he tells her that
this martin is one tough egg and
wouldnt think nuthin of takin advan-
tage of a busted rib

  she hates bloodshed and fightin and
seein guys get hurt worse than poison
and right away shes all sympathy for
the sailor she asks him why he dont
call off the fight and he strikes one of
them movie poses-you know-the
curfew shall not ring tonight-
sign the papers or drink the ink and
tells her that he cant call off the fight
on account of his honor bein involved
and the fight public would be off him
for life and hed never lift the mort-
gage on the old homestead can you
imagine any one falling for a lie like
that from sailor madden but this
kid is an uptown people-and she dont
savvy the double-x-see she falls
hook line and sinker

  well after a lot of skull work that
was thought up by me and spike otoole
-oh im not lettin myself out-the
sailor tells her that if she thinks any-
thing of him or wants to see him get
ahead shell help him out of the mess
hes in by trying to keep martin from
murderin him

  he tells her that if she can meet
martin and make dates with him and
keep him out at night so hell be just
a little bit tired and wont train so hard
why everything will be jake and the
sailor wont get hurt so bad the up-
shot is that the dame molly agrees to
help the sailor and promises to meet
martin and to take him for a few turns
on the merry-go-round-to keep him
out of top condition then the sailor
goes to work in earnest for the fight
hes working out like he never worked
for no fight in his life but hes work-
in early in the mornin-from daylight
-so that nobody will know that hes
trainin theyre keepin it a dark
secret

  ya understand on the form of
the sailor the last time out and on the
form of buster martin against mccabe
shoot that left



the odds is a million to one that martin
will knock the sailor kickin if he gets
a decent break if the sailor dont train
none why itll be martin in a breeze
and name your own ticket so the
sailor is laying around spikes joint all
afternoon makin his friends believe
that he aint gettin in any work and
dont intend to-and spike and him are
fixin things to make a killin on the bets
-ya get me they think that not even
their friends can tip the lay-and that
nobody will know that buster is not in
condition-sweet little layout eh well
the sailor is workin hard hidin out in
a gym up on th street and hes
roundin into shape fast i saw him
work i know form when i see it
that sailor guy is punchin that
sandbag groggy its one sweet little
plant

  cassidy was looking out the window
a deep frown creased his forehead his
hands were clenched in his pockets sud-
denly he whirled on the gyp and shook
him like a terrier shakes a rat you
sure this is on the level this line youre
handin me he hissed through set
teeth if i thought you was a spy for
that gang over there cornin here to
pump me for what i know id knock
your brains out

  its clean gasped frankie its
on the up-and-up that guy has
hit me for the last time im
through

  cassidy dug down in his pocket and
fished a twenty off his roll here take
this for the trouble he growled it
better be straight

  frankie the gyp shrugged his shoul-
ders i dont want no dough he pro-
tested im just over here givin you
the office because i dont want to see no
dirt done that boy buster im in deep
enough now ive pulled many a wise
one but this is the first white one ive
pulled in a long time-kinda balancin
things a little i dont want no dough
for tellin the truth just ask buster to
smack that sailor guy once in the kisser
few me and well be square

frankie sidled out of the gym
it seemed to be his natural gait-a
shuffling half-side step

  across the street a furtive-faced
gangster stopped in passing and ducked
around a show window he watched
through the window while cassidy and
the gyp were talking he saw the earn-
est look on frankies face and the
thoughtful frown on moan cassidy
he hurried around the corner just as
frankie emerged from the doorway

  five minutes later he was pouring the
tale of frankies indiscretion into the
stunned ear of spike otoole over the
telephone

  at the other end of the wire otoole
was muttering to himself the dirty
double-crossing rat the dirty stool-
pigeon  he hung up the receiver with
a bang when the spy had finished his
report he was silent for a long min-
ute in his mind was the thought that
he could never trust the gyp again-
not in any of the various shady enter-
prises that flourished under the direc-
tion of spike otoole

  he lifted the receiver and called a
number when an answering voice
sounded over the wire in his ear he
spoke cautiously

  hey dominick is that you 

  yea this is me came from the
other end in a foreign voice

  well listen close frankie the gyp
has just turned stool-pigeon and gave
a certain party a line of talk about some-
thin that shouldnt be mentioned see
hes dangerous-hes turned rat i
want you and the boys to take him for
a ride tonight-understand

  sure ok i understand came
the thick voice

  ko grunted spike theres a
grand here for a split in the morning-
dont mess up the job

  the receiver clicked

  that night a curtained automobile
swept dowm fourteenth street slacken-
ing speed as it approached second
avenue frankie the gyp was standing
on the corner of second avenue e


fight stories

cigaret between his ups-his back
turned to the curb

  the curtained car its license number
obscured by a thick layer of grease and
dust lurched in toward the curb an
automatic-several of them in fact
barked viciously and frankie was mak-
ing a frantic attempt to reach his own
hip-pocket even as he slithered down
on the curb and rolled off into the
gutter he twitched for a minute and
became quiet

  the darkened car roared down four-
teenth street to lose itself in the traffic

  frankie the gyp had been taken for
a ride   

chapter vii

buster discovers broadway

the music at sterns paradise was
intoxicating saxophones crooned
weird harmonies the rhythmic tap of
drums and cymbals beat a nerve-tingling
tempo at the piano charlie johnson
was giving his educated fingers plenty
of exercise dim lights discreet booths
tea in tea-cups constant laughter
swaying dancers white tableclothes
glowing table lamps pink and blue and
cherry sheen of dull silver white shirt
fronts glowing jewels on fair ladies
blondes titians brunettes-everything
that men preferred

  part of new yorks night life two
in the morning and blaring like a circus
side-show  tipsy old men bright-eyed
girls ermine wraps and jeweled coro-
nets haze of cigaret smoke stamp of
black-bottom daners smell of a hun-
dred perfumes here a movie celeb-
rity there a stage star over here a
champion gate-crasher over there a
flat-nosed pug one eye still black
spending last nights takings escorted
by a hilarious group of backers and
several too-painted women who looked
more at home on fourteenth street
than on the white way

back from the dance floor in a little

booth for two sat buster martin and
molly oconnor busters eyes were
ringed with black shadows he looked
weary his shoulders slumped he
was puffing on a cigaret his face was
a glaring white in the shadow light
still he was drinking in the false gayety
of the night club it was all new to him
this kid up from the corner newsstands
-up through hard work under the
spartan guidance of moan cassidy

  there was a fascination in the music
and the crowds-free spenders who
threw it away with a flourish and a
laugh men you knew only through the
columns of the newspapers orchestras
you heard only over the radio dances
you saw only on the stage hectic gayety
-fatal for a leather-pusher

  molly oconnor looking as fresh as
a rose in a florists window watched the
white face of the boy sitting across the
table from her there was a frown of
perplexity upon her face-almost the
look of a mother as she hovers over the
bed of a sick child molly found her-
self liking this quiet good-looking
broad-shouldered chap who wore eve-
ning clothes as if he were moulded to
them

  there was a doubt being born in her
heart she felt a guilty something with-
in her every time she looked at the
dark circles under his eyes and knew
that she was responsible for them being
there-and that she held the future of
buster martin in her hands

  these stories sailor madden had told
her could not be true buster was not
a man-killing blood-thirsty fighter who
cared nothing for the hurts of others
he could not be a cruel heartless
mauler wrho would take advantage of a
serious hurt in his opponent and use
that hurt as a pathway to victory it
could not be true molly oconnor
knew human nature her womans in-
stinct told her that buster martin was
clean all the way through and a gentle-
man in spite of his lapses in english

  he could not be heartless two nights
before she hd paused with him on a
shoot that left



street corner where a frail emaciated-
looking newsboy was selling papers and
fighting the chill of a march wind
buster had stopped and looked at the
kid for a long minute then he took the
kids papers and sold them all tor him
--sold them to men who worshipped
him as a fighter standing there on the
corner with the papers under his arm
until they were all gone after that
he took the kid across the street and
bought him a warm overcoat and a pair
of shoes and slipped him a bill buster
martin could not be a heartless fighting
machine if he could do a thing like that
it had made her wonder

  he glanced toward the floor want
to dance molly he asked half shyly
he always spoke to her that way as if
he was afraid that she was only a mirage
that would vanish forever if he lifted
his voice above a low tone she almost
loved him for it the look in his eyes
when he spoke to her the gentleness
of his hand as he helped her in or out
of a taxi

  she gulped down a sob of remorse-
she was double-crossing him-leading
him to ruin-

  she shook her head and tried to smile
no id rather sit here and talk with
you talk to me marty she begged
say something to me you sit so si-
lent-watching everything what  are
you thinking about 

  i was thinking about all this he
told her he was making painful efforts
to improve his speech since the first
night he had escorted her about new
york i was thinking how much i
missed when i was a kid how lucky
these guys are that have nothing to do
but sleep days and play nights it
must be a great racket-

  dont you sleep days she asked
knowing the answer in advance

  he looked at her for a long moment
no i dont sleep much days you
see i have to work like the deuce for
this fight with sailor madden it means
a lot to me and i dont dare sleep-not
with pop cassidy riding me and telling

me how rotten i am there was a
rueful grin on his face

   does he tell you that you are rotten 
she asked with interest

  does he he grinned he can tell
me that in seven languages and the
funny part is that hes telling the truth
i can feel it im not much interested
in this scrap yet it is my chance-my
chance to get to the top i know i can
take this madden bird like grant took
richmond

  there was a panic in mollys heart
she was hearing the result of her care-
fully planned campaign from the lips
of the man she was ruining for an
instant the face of sailor madden was
far away and only the white face of
buster martin filled her mind

  am i the cause for that she asked
softly

  he was silent for an instant looking
deeply into her eyes the tingle he had
known for the first time on meeting her
was alive again he wanted to leap
across the table and to crush her in his
arms instead he shook his head and
toyed with the knives and forks on the
table

   no he said slowly its me i guess
pop dont seem to understand that ive
been starving for this sort of thing all
my life he dont seem to understand
that i love music and laughs and lights
and more music no molly its that
little newsboy kid out on the corner
looking in through the window of some
swell restaurant wishing he could be
inside with his feet parked under the
table stowin away the good grub he
never tasted thats me   

  you see i wasnt nobody much-just
a newsboy-until moan cassidy got hold
of me and pushed me to the top hes
done everything for me moan has he
tucks me in bed at night he worries
like a grandaunt when im not in the
hay when he thinks i should be in but
molly its different somehow now that
i have you here with me-a lot dif-
ferent i used to think that nothing
in the world existed except the smack


fight stories

of gloves and the gym and trainin
trunks and soft shoes and old pop tell-
ing me to use at left buster

  its different now gee everything
is gone i cant think of nothing any
more except you you are in my mind
all the time    funny aint it

there was a tear in molly ocon-
nors eye more it trickled down
over her nose within her was a feel-
ing that she was a rotter that somehow
she had been tricked at first she had
accepted maddens game to destroy
busters chance of victory just as she
would have accepted a commission to
blot out something hideous from the
face of the earth she had steeled her-
self to endure an uncouth bully who
had to be gentled down to a point where
he would no longer be a man killer
now she felt that something was wrong
not with buster martin but with billy
madden-sailor madden-the man she
believed she loved

  mr cassidy must have been won-
derful to you she ventured in a trem-
bling voice

  gosh wonderful dont cover it by a
long shot said buster earnestly he
watches every mouthful i eat he tests
the water i drink he makes my bed
and shines my shoes and combs my
hair tonight when i came out he fixed
the studs in my shirt-i aint used to
them movable buttons yet-and he just
said goodbye and  know he was
broken-hearted because i was going out
when i should have been in the hay   

  but he dont understand molly he
dont understand how a wonderful girl
like you can change everything gee
molly if i only had you and pop cas-
sidy all the time i could lick the world
just to have you somewhere near me
where i could look at you once in a
while-see you smile    molly dear
do you think you could ever learn to
like a mutt like me who makes his livin
pushin other guys in the mush

  she lowered her head so that he could
not see her trembling lips and tear-filled

eyes she seemed suffocated for she
knew now that she cared    how
could she repay the wrong how could
she make things right so that he would
not hate her-curse her

  i do like you awfully she half-
whispered even if you do make your
living pushing other guys in the mush
i feel that perhaps i have done you a
great wrong-that ive been tearing you
down instead of building you up ive
been keeping you out of bed and all
that-

  he reached out his hand and covered
her own tiny white hand shucks
molly that aint nothin-excuse me-
that isnt anything i could lick this
madden guy with one hand if i thought
you were for me i could just get one
nights sleep and go in there as fresh
as a daisy-if you were sitting in my
corner how about it

  take me home she said in a
hushed tone take me home buster
i cant talk to you any more i must
think i have made a big mistake i
have committed a great wrong please
take me home

  he was standing beside her in an in-
stant what he demanded if
anything or anybody has done anything
to you ill wipe the street up with em
what is it molly

  she tried to smile it was a wan
attempt nothing that you can do
anything about-now she told him
its only me before i can talk with
you any more i have to think things
over find things out that are buried in
my own heart please buster take me
home

  buster martin said good night to
molly at her door and ordered the taxi
driver to take him to his hotel for
an hour he sat on the edge of his bed
dreaming of the girl and her voice and
the touch of her hand until pop cas-
sidy old moan came in from the next
room and helped him to undress

  cassidys eyes were troubled the
conversation with frankie the gyp was
fresh in his mind but he held his peace
shoot that left



it was too late to interfere now with
the fight only four days away it was
too late for anything-but to pray and
let fate decide

  that night frankie the gyp lay in the
gutter his frail sinsodden body riddled
with  slugs taken for a ride for
the first white thing he had attempted
in years

chapter viii
molly learns the truth

molly oconnor was going

to be sure she was going to
charge billy madden with lying to her
with sending her out to lure an innocent
boy to destruction merely because sailor
madden feared to meet him in a fair
fight she knew now that she did not
love madden she wondered how it
had been possible for her to ever be-
lieve she had loved him she thought
of his queer eyes and the hard metallic
ring of his laughter of his companions
-all of them looking like so many
gangsters and thugs

  yes she was going to have a show-
down with sailor madden and tell him
that she was through trying to put
buster martin in such a condition that
his climbing through the ropes in any
ring would be a farce

  she got out of the taxicab in front
of spike otooles office as she
alighted she stood across the street and
watched a group of foreign looking
thugs come down the stairs and out of
spikes office they were laughing
loudly among themselves and one was
counting a roll of bills she did not
know that spike had just finished split-
ting the grand he had promised for the
ride given frankie the gyp

  she passed along the hallway and
into the little room at the corner of the
hall where spike ran a poker game and
took his clients for private conversa-
tions she beckoned to a sweater-clad
evil-faced shifty-eyed youth and asked

him to tell sailor madden that she
wished to speak with him for a moment

  the budding gangster looked her up
and down in open admiration and
winked one eye suggestively i got-
cha kid he grinned showing a row
of yellow teeth ill get him out of
the front for you

  he ambled along the hall puffing
upon a cigarette which dangled from
one corner of his mouth knocking
discreetly on the door to spikes office
he stuck his head through and motioned
with an eloquent thumb toward the rear
of the hall

  that swell frail is lack there and
wants to whisper in yer ear he grinned
at sailor madden

  madden started in surprise and
glanced at otoole its that molly
broad he announced in a stage whis-
per you see i told you that i
couldnt keep her away from me with a
baseball bat

  listen guy answered spike in the
same hoarse whisper you take a fools
advice and tie the can on that dame get
me i feel wrong about her see
shes not in your class youre going to
trip yourself up

  baloney grinned the sailor with
his crooked mouth ive got her tied
down and counted out she thinks the
sun rises and goes down in my back
yard look at the play shes been givin
this martin guy he aint done a lick
of training and aint been in bed one
night since i sicked her on him what
do you think of them bananas

  some of the gloom on spike otooles
brow lifted well i admit she did
a clever piece of wjork there but re-
member she did it in the dark she
wasnt tipped off on the up and up
you never can tell with a jane like that
best thing to give her the air

 you let this jane to me boasted
madden expansively i know how
to handle girls i got a way with
em

  blah grunted spike in disgust
blah you talk like you didnt have


fight stories

a busted nose and a split lip and two
flat ears out of my life

  the sailor took a hitch at the top of
his trousers and lifted his coat off the
back of a chair he glanced into a
cracked mirror hung on the wall
straightened his hair and with a mock-
ing wave of his hand strutted out into
the hall

  the page boy-the coming gangster
-watched him go admiration shining in
his eyes he heaved a deep sigh as the
sailor disappeared through the door

  what a lad he sighed and what
a line he hands them wimmin

  spike snorted what a false alarm
and what a sap he is for them wimmin
he mimicked in the same tone

in the back room molly was waiting
impatiently sailor madden entered
an anxious look upon his face he
was clever this leather pusher-a great
actor he managed the anxious look
to perfection

  molly he whispered molly is
there anything wrong

  he placed both hands on her shoul-
ders and bent to kiss her she suffered
the caress and he could not sense the
shudder that passed through her as his
face brushed against her cheek

  i just wanted to come in and say
hello she began i havent seen much
of you since i went out to entertain mr
buster martin i thought maybe you
had forgotten me

  forget you lied madden why
i think of you every minute every
minute i say to myself-what a won-
derful little pal she is what a wonder-
ful girl to go out and sacrifice her
happiness for three whole weeks just to
save her boy friend from getting hurt
too badly

  not that i care molly i dont mind
being hurt but i dont want to lay in
a hospital for a couple of months with
a punctured lung or something after the
office is in at martins camp that i have
a fractured rib ive got too much to
live for now that i have you he was

speaking as if from carefully rehearsed
lines

  she glanced up at his face in her
heart she knew that he was lying are
you sure she asked in a low tone
are you sure you think that much of
me and appreciate what im doing for
you 

  do i  why kiddo i was just sayin
to spike that we owe everything to you
-everything

  billy she always called him billy
rather than sailor-it is true that you
injured your ribs isnt it it isnt just
a trick to get me to secure an easy
victory foryou over martin

  his eyes glowed dangerously and he
looked down at her in a cold fury then
he remembered his part

  true of course its true he lied
even now i cant bear any pressure on
my left side under the heart you know
right where they hit most what dou-
ble-crossing stool pigeon has been telling
you that it aint so

  in his fury he was forgetting to be
cultured

  she didnt answer the question but
asked another it is true that you
come from a good family and that
youre only fighting because its the only
way you know to get enough money to
help your parents isnt it

  he did tricks with a poor memory
he had told so many lies he took a
chance certainly its true he de-
clared solemnly every dime i get
goes home to the folks i hardly keep
enough to buy decent clothes and to
live on

  she appeared satisfied you dont
have any other girls but me do you
you arent in love with any other girl
are you

  the glare in his eyes was postively
dangerous as he looked at her listen
kid he demanded spit it out what
stool has been working on you what
dirty double crossin rat has been spillin
his guts about me ill take that lyin
buzzard and jerk his tongue out from
the roof of his mouth
shoot that left i



  he saw that she was shrinking away
from him

  dont be frightened molly he
begged fighting to control his rage
you know how it is it makes me
angry to have some one telling lies
about me to the only girl i ever cared
for all of us big men-all of us
champions-have to stand for that
though guys that dont like us whis-
per nasty lies behind our backs and
we only hear them when friends tell us
about the wise-cracks that are going
around ive listened to plenty theyre
all lies i can prove it i can prove it
by spike otoole that t dont have any
other girl youll believe spike

  as quickly as i would anybody else
around here she said ambiguously i
just wanted to know

  well i told you he said with a
look out of the corner of his eye to
observe how she was taking it im a
champion of the world im in the
same class with movie stars and people
like that the public likes to make up
stories about me  i cant stop them
but i thought you loved me enough not
to believe everything you hear

  she smiled oh let it pass what
do you think of the fight now

  well he told her with a crestfallen
look glad to drop the subject it wont
be much of a fight i cant work out
at all because i cant stand the pain in
my side i can only hope that martin
isnt in top shape and that he wont
find out about the busted ribs

  she smiled again wanly this time
oh he wont be in shape she prom-
ised him he looks worn out right
now

  he could hardly suppress a grin of
glee at the news i heard that you
were doing a good job he said patting
her on the shoulder after the fight
is over and im feeling better ill try to
find a way to repay you for all youve
done for me

  she took up her fur and started for
the door i hope so she half-whis-
pered i hope so she passed through

the hall wearily almost dragging her
feet

  madden watched her go a puzzled
look upon his face he shook his head
several times then he grined be-
lieve me he muttered to himself ill
find a way to muzzle that bozo when the
fireworks is all over

  he entered spikes office

      chapter ix
      the eavesdropper

molly at the foot of the steps
halted and glanced quickly up the
street a blonde girl with too much
rouge was hurrying along evidently
about to turn in at spikes doorway
with a wildly beating heart molly
turned and fled back up the steps she
dashed down the dark hall on tip toes
and slipped into the private confer-
ence room there was a small closet
in the wall opposite the place where
sailor madden usually sat she darted
into the closet just as footsteps entered
the room

  she heard a feminine voice giving
orders evidently to the same young
gangster she had asked to go fo sailor
madden after a moment a heavier
footstep sounded and the sailors voice
broke the stillness

  hello stella old kid it said
heartily whats on your mind if any-
thing this morning

  you heard the news asked stella
just loud enough to be heard

  what news asked the sailor

  frankie the gyp was taken for a
ride last night they fished him out of a
gutter this morning-full of holes

  there was a low whistle from the
sailor

  ah dont come that holier-than-
thou-stuff on me sailor sneered
stella youd like to make me think
that you didnt know a thing about it-

otoole

have a second shot at the lightweight
title-the big sap

  funny how a girl can bust a good
man up aint it mused stella now
if everything was even this buster could
have taken you in his stride but after
that molly or whatever her name is
finishes with him he cant lick a postage
stamp what a sucker

  hell be a sucker after i nail him
a few in the ribs and under the heart
with this right boasted the sailor a
ferocious something in his voice ill
teach him to challenge for my title
ill kill the little umpchay ive got
him when hes soft and im in shape
when i get finished well-hell have
whiskers before he can walk around
again

  well im off announced stella
but remember dont get gay with
that molly skirt youll be sorry her
voice was cold with threat
shoot that left



  the sailor laughed a nasty laugh
boloney kid that dame dont mean a
thing to me-no more than frankie the
gyp shell get the gate as soon as
shes through playing the little game
spike and me cooked up for her
stella slouched along the hallway one
hand on an enticing hip red lips smiling
a satisfied smile sailor madden breath-
ing a sigh of relief went back into spike
otooles office

  the closet door opened and molly
oconnor totered out the air had
been nearly suffocating in the narrow
confines of the wall closet her face
was streaming with perspiration she
felt weak-giddy her head was
whirling but she had heard sailor
maddens voice-everything the two of
them had said she knew exactly where
she stood and what a fool she had been
she felt sick white inside when she
thought of what she had led buster
martin into and what a rotter madden
was she felt sick as she thought of
martins beautiful young white body
soft from lack of training wilting un-
der the savage pounding of maddens
brutal fists a man going into the ring
with the sole thought of forever crip-
pling a clean-living boy who was his
master except for the dirty work of
molly oconnor all of her girlhood
shrieked a protest she was weeping
silently she crept on hands and knees
past the doorway of spikes office and
down into the street

chapter x
molly calls on pop

buster martin did not see his
molly for the next three days
neither did he hear from her he
haunted the telephone and the hotel
lobby but no call came from her-no
word her silence did not help he
could not sleep at night he paced his
room or fell into fitful dozes from which
he awoke with a start harried by fren-

zied dreams of the girl who had come
to occupy the major portion of all his
moments

  he was as nervous as a cat drawn
to a fine line haggard weary with the
fight one da- away-one day and one
night it seemed that he was more fit
for a sanitarium for nervous cases than
a prize ring and the smack of thudding
gloved fists against his naked body

  cassidy stricken with new lines run-
ning about his eyes and the corners of
his mouth said nothing there was
nothing he could say only a miracle
would win buster martin this fight
only a miracle could keep him on his
feet after the first round miracles
were things of the past and anyway
they didnt belong in the prize ring
clean training judgment a stiff punch
the ability to duck and counter wind
legs lungs-but no miracles

  buster still insisted upon working out
even though cassidy would have pre-
ferred that he rest no need to bum
up the little remaining stamina but
buster whirled around the gym cutting
viciously at the light bag and socking
into the heavy sand bag as if trying to
vent his disappointment on something
concrete the pity of it was that after
one or two socks he was breathing like
a porpoise and his legs trembled as if
shaken with the ague

  he did not mention molly he never
talked about anything moan cassidy
knew that the boy was hurt he knew
that he had been double-crossed yet
he dared not mention the fact it would
be the last straw-the cutting away of
the last prop that held buster to a ves-
tige of sanity he could only hope that
buster would survive the madden fight
without serious injury and that he could
rebuild from the wreck build up a new
buster with more vision and more gray-
matter

  then on the night before the fight a
timid knock came on his door he took
his slippered feet off the dresser set
down his corncob pipe carefully and bel-
lowed a gruff come in pop cassidy


fight stories

was not in a mood to talk with any one

  he struggled to his feet a moment
later and endeavored to hide his embar-
rassment and to appear natural he
knew the identity of his visitor he had
heard her description so many times
from buster that it was impossible for
him to mistake her his hand was trem-
bling his brain was hardly clear he
was face to face with the girl who had
so heartlessly ruined his boy and who
had tumbled the dreams of a lifetime
down about his shoulders

  im molly oconnor announced
the girl in a dead voice ive come to
talk with you if youll talk to me i
had to i had to talk with some one it
hurts me-here she pressed her hand
over her heart

  cassidy gave her the chair and perched
on the edge of the bed he was not
impressed as yet he knew that girls
could be good actresses frankie the
gyp had said that molly was sailor
maddens girl maybe she was acting
-maybe not he waited for her to
speak

  i havent been near buster in the
past four days she confessed in the
same flat voice i guess you know
that i guess you know what i did to
him i ruined him

  moan cassidy nodded and picked up
his corncob pipe seemed he could al-
ways think better with that pipe burn-
ing

  what can i do to help now this
late she cried you dont know
what ive gone through you dont
know what ive suffered ive been a
little fool a sap as sailor madden
would say he told me that hed be
terribly hurt if buster was to hit him
on the right side i fell for the story
i agreed to help him by keeping buster
out of condition i did it and now i
feel that madden intends injuring bus-
ter for life to hurt him so badly that
hell never be able to fight again and
im the person who did it-not any blow
that madden may strike

  i knew it all the time informed cas-

sidy i was tipped off i knew that
buster was riding to a fall but i
thought that he couldnt be wrong all
the way i thought maybe youd rec-
ognize what a good clean honest boy
he is and kind of lay off of him

  you knew and you didnt tell him
she cried

  pop cassidy nodded no i didnt
tell him he has a right to be happy
if he can be happy if he loved you as
much as he said he did-well it would
take a pretty bad girl not to like buster
i was sure that you werent bad else he
couldnt love you as much as he does
hes broken hearted because you havent
had anything to do with him during the
past four days moonin around the
gym like a dying calf-trying to work
he cant work at all hes thinkin of
you all the time i cant do anything
about it either

  her cheeks were white does he
think that much of me she asked
softly

  cassidy snorted lady at this min-
ute that boy would throw away his box-
ing gloves forever if you were to say
the word hed go back to sellin news-
papers or them bonds you been tellin
him about if he thought it would get
a nod from you hes licked ive seen
it before

she was weeping oh mr cas-
sidy tell me something i can do to
wipe out this terrible thing isnt there
something 

  cassidy shook his head sadlv no
miss he declared there aint noth-
ing that can be done i reckon buster
will have to take his medicine only
thing you can do-and i ask you to do
this because i love the boy like my own
son-is to keep him straight when this
is all over dont just feel sorry for
him and leave him go after he goes
through this hell if you love him say
so and help me make a man out of
him and a champion

  i wont have you foolin him no
longer miss i know youre sorry
shoot that left i



nobody by the name of molly ocon-
nor would be crooked and like it if
you love him close your eyes the night
he meets sailor madden try to for-
get that a game kid is going in against
a bird that would hit him with a brick
if he thought he could get away with it
forget about him staggerin around the
ring and tryin to hit back go out and
help him to get back on his feet-up to
where he belongs girl do you love
my buster

  she looked straight into his eyes
yes i do she whispered her cheeks
were crimson but her eyes were flam-
ing with a new glory i didnt know
it until the other evening when i sat
watching him but i do i thought i
was just sorry for him but now i know
that i miss him theres a great empty
spot in my heart when he isnt near me
im hungry for him now-and i love
him ill pay him hack with my whole
life for this mistake ive made if hell
only give me the chance

  there was a wetness in old moan
cassidys eyes he patted her kindly
upon the shoulder dont feel too bad
molly he comforted although his own
heart was weighted with grief we all
make mistakes i have and the
boyll need you more now than ever
before stick to him girl hes worth
it

  she was weeping softly her eyes
were fixed on the opposite wall she
squared her shoulders as if arriving at
a decision listen to me she begged
of cassidy maybe i can help may-
be there is something that can be done
it would be hard but it would help and
maybe it might even win him the cham-
pionship it would mean the end be-
tween buster and i but ill make the
sacrifice maybe i can pay him back

  cassidy was staring at her what is
it girl what are you talking about
he demanded in a tense voice

  well she smiled through her tears
if buster could know that he had been
double-crossed as you call it and that
sailor madden had used me to do the

double-crossing wouldnt he think that
i had never been playing square with
him wouldnt he hate me wouldnt
he do his best to get even with madden
for breaking his heart and his strength
wouldnt he go into that ring for-
getting that he was tired forgetting
everything excepting that he had
been cheated and hurt wouldnt he
do his best to beat that madden fel-
low as quickly and as terribly as pos-
sible

  cassidy was studying her face any
fellow with any guts would do that
he told her

  well pop listen the night of the
fight let me call up madden ill tell
him that ill be waiting for him in the
dressing-room of buster martin and
that hes to stop in there and take me
with him to the ringside as he goes
along the corridor ill tell him that
that will be the last straw to batter down
busters nerves ill tell him that if
buster sees him walking off with the
girl he believes is his that it will finish
him ill tell madden that he can tell
buster how i double-crossed him that
it will make the boy feel worse mad-
den will do it hed jump at a chance
to gloat over buster to take me out of
the dressing-room in front of busters
eyes to break his spirit completely
hed like to crush him that way as
well as with his fists dont you think
it will work she regarded cassidy
anxiously

  there was a new light of hope in
cassidys eyes he stared at her as if
seeing her for the first time then he
jumped to his feet and smote his hands
together with a mighty crash

  if i know my buster and sailor
madden will fall for that story we have
a chance-a chance in a million-but a
chance if buster has the strength to
stand up and swing one punch at that
crooks jaw we have a chance i hate
crooks he won the title that way-a
frameup like he rap with you molly
girl if youre game to go through with
this maybe we have a chance im not


fight stories

promising anything im just willing
to lay a bet on busters fighting heart
a heart that goes on fighting after his
nerves and muscles have quit ill take
the chance can you do it 

  she smiled confidently trying to
cover her quivering lips yes i can
do it she promised i can do any-
thing to pay for the wrong i did buster
ill do it ill bring sailor madden to
busters dressing-room fifteen minutes
before they step into the ring ill do
it or die

  when she had gone cassidy stood
staring up at the electric light set in the
ceiling next door he could hear bus-
ter tramping up and down haunting the
telephone still hoping for some word
from his molly

      chapter xi
       to  on martin

down in caverns under the arena
buster martin was in his dress-
ing-room his hands were taped his
trunks were on his shoes were laced se-
curely the gloves had been fitted on
before the eyes of a representative of
the boxing commission and a personal
representative of the champion buster
martin was ready for the ring but
buster was sound asleep upon the rub-
down table cassidy stood over him
his watch in his hand keeping an abso-
lute stillness in the room over in one
corner the water-bucket and bottles
along with the smelling salts and the
terrible searing collodion that was used
on deep cuts to stop the bleeding were
waiting to be carried to busters corner
of the ring when the youngster
mounted the stairs to face his ordeal of
battle

  in the dressing-room there was no
sound but the deep even breathing of
the sleeping buster

  in sailor maddens dressing-room
was a different scene the scowling
sailor was dancing around on his toes

looking trained to the minute and mak-
ing vicious lunges at imaginary buster
martins shadow-boxing flexing his
muscles waiting for the minute when
the call boy would summon him to the
ring

  spike otoole was chuckling to a
group of his particular cronies oh
boy he was saying wont there be
a yowl tomorrow when the news leaks
out listen the odds are  to 
on martin the office is in that the
sailor hasnt trained a lick for this bout
and that hes ready to blow the title-
cant make the weight they think hes
trained on beer and bananas get me
ive been covering as much of the mar-
tin dough as i can grab without spiliin
the mitt been takin it since last
week goin in hock to raise more dough
when my own ran out this is the big-
gest shot ive ever pulled and take it
from me its a lulu why them wise
boys out in front are just beggin for
die chance to get money down on mar-
tin at name-your-own price i wish i
had a million to bet this scrap is
strictly in the bag the sailor will fin-
ish that lush in about the second round
write that down in the book look at
him gents hes in the pink and rarin
to go

  sailor madden was thinking of other
things he was thinking of that little
frail molly molly had called him
up an hour ago and had told him to
stop in martins dressing-room on his
way to the ring to see the result of her
handiwork she had asked in such a
seductive voice that madden had
promised

  the sailor was easy to influence-
when it came to gloating over a rival
he wanted to see buster martin pale
and drawn and white before he met
him in the ring he wanted to say a
few things and then he wanted to take
molly out of there with him not that
he cared anything about molly but just
to get martins goat he was impatient
for the word-for the call to the
slaughter
shoot that left



back in martins dressing-room the
door opened and a white-faced
molly crept into the room she looked
questioningly at the table on which
buster was sleeping soundly

  first time hes been asleep in two
days whispered cassidy hoarsely
hell wake up with a grouch against
the world and that little bit of sleep
will do him more good than a shot of
hop i still have hopes how about
the sailor

  i called him up about an hour ago
he promised hed stop by and say a few
words to buster on the way to the ring
cassidy nodded his head in satisfac-
tion well i hope it works the way
i want it to remember you must act
the part though you got to sit in
maddens corner and every time buster
looks at you you have to be yelling for
madden to smash him

  she nodded wearily i understand
she murmured i wont fail after
tonight it wont make any difference-
that is for me ill never see buster
again he never will want to see me
hell hate me despise me i cant
blame him i deserve it but it will
be hard to have to know that he is
thinking those things

  upstairs the semi-final was moving
fast and furiously the crowd was
having its appetite for the final bout
whetted by a good old-fashioned slug-
fest and was crying encouragement to
the two fighters slugging in the center
of the ring

  it was over one of the boys snaked
a right to the jaw and stood staring
stupidly at the crumpled form of the
man at his feet the referee had to
wave him away twice before he would
go to a far corner and let the count pro-
ceed the electric indicator showed
that it was the eighth round of a ten-
round fight the referees arm rose and
fell on the fatal count of ten seconds
leaped into the ring and half supported
the loser to his corner the winner
shook hands with himself in front of
the crowd

  a sudden stillness fell over the im-
mense arena the lull before the storm
then a rising sea of voices-the mur-
mur of twenty thousand mouths talking
at one time

  in one corner of the ringside seats
some of the wise boys were getting
money down on the coming fight
anxious to bet on martin at any odds
spike otoole had trained his wrorkers
well they listened with assumed re-
luctance and accepted bets in the same
spirit the word had been passed
that sailor madden was about to
blow his title and that at the end of
fifteen rounds a new champion would
have his hand raised

  a wheezing band tried to make itself
heard above the clamor of conversation
lights were turned on all over the hall
for the moment the bright klieg lights
over the ring were turned off fireflies
appeared by the thousand-little flames
darting up here and there as cigarets
were lighted in anticipation of the big
battle

  in the betting corner the odds were
now  to  against madden and spike
otoole was gloating hed be worth
a million in the morning

  in martins dressing-room a tired
white-faced boy was still sleeping a
cowering white-faced girl was slumped
down in a straight-backed chair and a
red-faced old man was waiting with
anxious eyes and pounding heart-an
old man who wore a roll-necked sweater
on which appeared the words buster
martin

chapter xii
the clang of the bell

in the sailors dressing-room the
sailor started toward the door es-
corted by spike otoole and a young
army of handlers true the handlers
would all creep into positions along the
ring side after the sailor climbed
through tke ropes it was part of the


fight stories

graft for only three men would be per-
mitted in his corner but at the moment
they were handlers and the police
guard let them through it was one of
the ways spike otoole and sailor
martin rewarded the faithful

  sailor madden swaggered impor-
tantly down the corridor at the door
to buster marlins dressing-room he
paused and waved for all to go on ex-
cepting spike otoole he winked
largely at the surprised otoole and
hammered on the door otoole stared
at him this was a new trick

   im goin to rub it in a little an-
nounced the sailor with a nasty grin
there was a nasty tone in his voice also
a grating tone of triumph wait till
you see the fireworks

  moan cassidy stuck his head out of
the door sailor madden pushed his
hand in cassidys face and forced his
way into the room the noise disturbed
the sleeping martin he roused him-
self and propped his head up on one
arm staring owlishly at the unshaven
face of madden madden strutted into
the center of the dressing-room and
looked the place over with his sneering
face

  nice little layout he commented
he started as if he had not noticed
molly before sitting in her chair in one
corner he waved at her and showed
his teeth in a grin

  hello babe he called genially
ready to go

  she nodded her head and rose to her
feet

  buster martin looked on his brain
was clearing he saw molly for the
first time

  shes been waiting here a half an
hour informed cassidy briefly he
was studying busters eyes

  whats the idea of the loud conver-
sation demanded buster of madden

  what conversation asked madden
innocently aint a guy got the right
to talk to his best girl

  buster glanced toward molly she
was walking over to the sailor

  his what shrieked buster

  you  eard me guy said madden
nastily  have half a mind to bust
you one-just to pay myself for lettin
her be with you for a couple of nights
shell be glad to get back with human
beings again wont you babe

  molly busters voice held an
agonized note his eyes were blinking
a wet blanket had come down and
smothered his heart molly-you
dont mean-molly say it aint the
truth  say you aint his girl-you-

  the girls eyes flashed her bosom
heaved she was making her big scene
cassidy watched her eagerly

  aw cut the baby stuff she said in
a rough voice and with a laugh almost
like the nasty laugh of sailor madden
cut the baby stuff im tired of hear-
ing it ive stood for it for four weeks
now and id like a new line molly
this and molly that you starin at me
like a moon faced calf-and me handin
you the old salve what makes you
think i like the cut of your mug bozo
what makes you think i could take a
tumble for you when theres men
around 

  she moved closer to the sailor who
was grinning over her shoulder at the
shaken martin

  why dont you get this cassidy guy
to mother you some more she went
on you think theres any dough in
it for me stringin with yon you big
sap im a live guy-not a dead one i
know where my dough is cornin from
before i start takin a hand in the game

  her pale lips curled in a sneer you
with your molly-it aint true of
course its true anybody but a dumb-
bell would have tumbled to the racket
long ago i gave you a good time and
kept you out of bed and away from
trainin so my boy friend here sailor
madden could give you the beating of
your young life and believe me kid
i hope he makes it a good one for the
pain in the neck youve been to me dur-
ing this last month olive oil kid ill
see you in the funny papers
shoot that left



  she laughed once more the hard
metallic laugh of sailor madden and
minced out of the room without a
glance back at the door she looked
cassidy up and down theres your
little boy all back again safe and sound
think about him being the champion
after you carry him out of the ring
will you you big champanzee

  the bulk of sailor madden hurled
back the assault of moan cassidy
buster martin was standing with
clenched fists and blazing eyes there
were two red spots on his face-one
over each cheek bone he was staring
at madden his jaws working as he
ground his teeth in helpless fury

  so its a plant eh he spat at
madden through set teeth you dirty
yellow cowardly dog-gettin a woman
to defend you in the ring

  he lost control of his twitching
muscles and leaped forward before
spike or cassidy could interfere his
fist shooting out in a right swing
bashed against maddens jaw and
madden reeled back against the wall
he came back fighting-to face a rag-
ing animal in the form of buster mar-
tin

martin was clawing at moan
cassidy in an attempt to get at
madden spike otoole was hauling
the sailor away

  come on you idiot he was bellow-
ing you dont get paid for fighting
down here you get paid for fighting up
in the ring-if you want to fight-fight
it out upstairs

  the door slammed and they were
gone-leaving buster martin with sag-
ging shoulders and a lead weight where
his heart had been

  he raged about the room after a sec-
ond pounding at the walls with his
gloved fists kicking at chairs and tables
glowering at everyone in the room with
burning eyes

  cassidy ventured to speak buster
boy theyre waiting upstairs for you
theyre announcing from the ring now

    f-june-

we have to go buster boy if you
want action take it out of his hide
and remember the girl will be sittin
there in his corner watching him cut
you to ribbons they mean to do it
boy they mean to hammer you down
for fifteen rounds so that you never
will be in condition to fight again
make it short buster go after him
boy get him in the first round if you
can

  martin was almost calm outwardly
inwardly he was raging listen
pop he said fiercely i threw you
down see im a rotten dog you
told me what was cornin and i laughed
at you ive busted up your whole life
and ive made a bum out of you after
youve done everything for me i stood
here and listened to them crooks call
you names-and you the best guy in
the world but pop-i aint dead yet
im going up to lick him or get killed
im goiiv to lick him or get killed tryin
lets go-you guys lets go-before
i go crazy

  he threw open the door and half ran
up the stairs and into the brilliant glare
of the lights the crowd was waiting
patiently for him as soon as his head
and shoulders appeared above the sit-
ting crowd as he walked to the ring a
tremendous ovation greeted him he
noticed nothing his face was white
and drawn his hands were twitching
the hectic red spots were still over
each cheek bone

  he was climbing through the ring
ropes he couldnt see anything be-
cause of the glare in his eyes he
didnt see that the entire crowd was on
its feet cheering him as the new cham-
pion the word had already gone
around that the sailor and he had
staged an impromptu battle in martins
dressing room the word was around
that this was to be a fight for blood-
a fight over a girl-and to the finish

  dimly he felt pop cassidy pushing
him toward the center of the ring
dimly he listened to the referee and
heard nothing he felt the lights go


fight stories

out all over the building leaving the
ring in its stark-naked whiteness with
two fighters in the center of the
glare

  a whistle blew he knew that he
had hold of the top ropes in his cor-
ners and was flexing his muscles as he
always did he saw mollys face for
one second-dimly outlined in the
tricky light below him and he saw
she was laughing at him the flame
burned widi a new intensity he was
aching to feel sailor maddens body
against his gloved fists a terrible
noise sounded in his ears he jumped
and whirled around as if on a spring
it was the gong-the signal for the be-
ginning of the first round

chapter xiii
buster martin vs sailor madden

madden had leaped out of his
corner like a raging beast buster
met him in the center of the ring they
stood toe to toe for a full minute arms
working with the speed of lightning
bolts buster was playing for the face
madden was pounding at busters stom-
ach madden knew that it would be
a downstairs battle a rounds
pounding in the belly would just about
finish a fighter in the condition of bus-
ter martin

  buster seemed not to feel the shower
of blows he was intent upon crashing
his gloved fists into maddens face he
had forgotten science-forgotten how
to tie his man up to prevent body pun-
ishment he was merely a berserk sav-
age a street brawler living only for
the pleasure it gave him to feel the
flesh of maddens face under his fists

  he stepped back he was panting
maddens last punch had hurt him his
stomach felt sick he realized now his
lack of condition he was shaken all
over he heard spike otoole yelling
to madden

  that shot got him sailor-that shot
spilled his guts go in and rip a few

more to the same place he cant take
it downstairs

  in martins corner pop cassidy was
chewing on his checked cap-chewing it
to tatters he was suffering each time
one of the sailors pile-driving hooks
thudded into the soft stomach of his
boy he was praying tears were
streaming down his cheeks he tried
to yell encouragement and only a hoarse
croak resulted still buster did hear
that old cry

  shoot at left buster-shoot at
left

  martin gave ground and studied the
sailor his eyes were red with hate
madden was sneering at him martins
left glove shot out like a whip-lash and
the spat of leather on flesh smashed the
sneer from maddens lips madden
snarled there was blood trickling
from the corner of his mouth he
rushed and again martin gave ground
shooting punches from underneath up
at the sailors covered head he felt
them going in-one-two-three the
sailor straightened up and martin
drove a right cross to the temple that
shook madden to his toes

  the sailor was screaming at him
mouthing vile language again the red
tide surged into martins eyes he
went in to fight it out toe to toe a
jolting short right took him under the
heart his mouthed jarred open and
another terrific left to the same spot
caused him to gasp the world went
black suddenly a right hook landed on
his jaw he felt himself slipping-go-
ing down he felt the soft surface of
the canvas was dimly aware that the
shrieking maniacs out in the darkness
were people-men and women he
knew that he had been knocked down
and that the referee was counting he
knew that over in the far corner mad-
den was standing with his arms thrown
over the ropes and a nasty smirk on
his battered face

  pie turned his buzzing head and his
eyes rested on the form of pop cas-
sidy miles away chewing on his cap-
shoot that left



tears in his eyes his head cleared a
little he saw the referees arm going
up and down he was saying eight
and the voice sounded a mile off he
had to go on hed thrown pop down
-treated him like a dog

  below him a frantic radio announcer
was telling the world 

  martin is down in his comer right
over our heads his eves are glazed
and there is a look of pain on his face
those terrific smashes over the heart
literally drove him into the canvas it
will be a bad night for the boys who bet
against the champion at odds of  to
 it looks as if martin is not going to
survive the round 

  he was up he threw himself to his
feet as the referees arm was ascending
for the tenth count sailor madden
was all over him in an instant mar-
tins reeling brain told him that he must
cover and get away he couldnt his
legs were trembling his arms felt
heavy he saw the punch coming and
couldnt duck it it thudded home on
his jaw again he crashed to the can-
vas and the fatal ten was being
chanted again and the radio announcer
was saying

  it surprised us all when martin got
to his feet he was still very groggy
and badly hurt hes down again with
a right to the jaw hell stay down
this time or im no judge of fighters
hes terribly hurt there is blood
streaming from his mouth and his legs
are like rubber the sailors punches
must be more terrible than we imagine
for martins body is quivering from the
impact  by glory hes up

the thrill-crazed announcer was
right martin was staggering to
his feet for an instant-for an in-
stant only-his fighting heart was telling
him that he must stand up he tried to
charge madden but madden was back-
ing away sneering at him madden
landed two short lefts to the body and
an overhand right to the top of busters
head the blows felt like the landing

of a pile driver and they were only
taps-measuring punches

  he tried to box but his arms were
too heavy he heard a shrill voice-a
girls voice it sounded over the din of
twenty thousand fight mad fans

  kill him sailor kill the big bum 
martin knew that voice it was
mollys all of the rage of five min-
utes ago surged through him he felt
himself strong again his head cleared
he felt that he was out-boxing the
sailor-automatically pop cassidys
training

  he flicked out his left and saw the
blood spatter from the sailors flat nose
he stepped back feinted with his left
and crossed a heavy right to the sailors
jaw it went home like a lightning bolt
it shook the sailor from heels to head
he heard spikes rough voice

  keep away from that right you
dummy spike was bellowing that
guy can hit as long as he is alive
martin was grinning-a wolf grin
hit hed show em he could hit
he waded in close and ripped his right
hand to the sailors heart again the
sailor wilted a trifle and gave ground
and martin the terrible rage burning
him up followed after him-shooting
short rights and lefts to the jaw and
head of the snarling man before him
he could sec nothing but the head of
the sailor and the bloody gleam on two
of his gold teeth buster reveled in
the sight he was counting-making
him feel the weight of his fists

  he lashed forward and drove an up-
percut to the jaw at the same mo-
ment madden side-stepped and from
a crouch drove a body punch at mar-
tin it went home with terrible force
-and it was low martin groaned
aloud in his agony and started to double
up as he sank to the floor the sailor
shot two rights to the jaw

  when he wrent down martin knew
that he was done hed felt that pain
before it was the muscle and heart
paralysing blow-the dirty punch a
punch the referee couldnt see a thou-


fight stories

sand voices shrieked foul but the
referee shook his head and began the
count and martin sank lower  the
floor

  in the corner pop cassidy stood
tears streaming down his face his lips
muttering strange curses there was a
towel in his hand he was thinking
that he had to save his buster from fur-
ther punishment he had to save him
from terrible injury he blamed him-
self should have called the fight oft
in his grief he forgot that the rules will
not permit a fighters manager to end
the fight by throwing in the sponge
the referee must end the fight-or
stop it

  in maddens corner a white-faced
girl a stricken light in her eyes
watched the gray face of the man she
loved the referees arm was going up
for the ninth time the house was a
bedlam and martin was still inert upon
the floor of the ring-near to his own
corner

  a hoarse fog-horn sound broke
through the din it was the frenziedly
ringing bell martin was saved for an-
other three minutes of torture

  madden turned to his corner his
face was slippery with blood and two
great welts showed on his flesh where
the gloves of buster martin had left
their trade-mark

   at guy can sure hit he gasped to
spike otoole ill get him next
round

  you stay away from that right of
his-as long as hes on his feet snarled
otoole

  madden grinned

  with the sound of the bell cassidy
had leaped into the ring and by main
strength dragged the almost uncon-
scious buster to his corner he knew
it to be a hopeless gesture he knew
that buster would never answer the bell
for the second round cassidy had seen
them go down like that before he was
working on the boy mechanically-from
long practice buster lifted his head
and looked up with dull eyes

  what round is it he demanded of
pop cassidy what round is it
the end of the first answered cas-
sidv truthfully and youre out on your
feet

chapter xiv
the boomerang returns

a tremor shook martin tn
out when im out he growled
ill paste that big gorilla yet i had
him goin and he got yellow and fouled
me when the ref couldnt see the shot
listen if youve got any idea of
throwin in the sponge for me-just be-
cause im on the floor-you forget it
so help me if you heave in that sponge
im off you for life promise me pop
-no sponge ill take it if i have to
get it but let me go down fightin-
please

  cassidy looked down at him there
was a light in his eyes that only a father
could correctly interpret i promise
kid he said huskily he glanced up
that molly girl is over there in the
sailors corner havin a regular circus
he reported

  martins body went tense and rigid
oh yeah he said through his split
lips yeah well ill send her little
boy friend home next round o k my
gosh pop but im tired i can hardly
stand up

  the buzzer buzzed ten seconds to
go

  that left buster begged cassidy
that left to tilt up his head hes a
mark for it then let him have the
right he pushed him off the stool
toward the center of the ring

  the radio announcer was talking
again to his unseen audience

  cassidy has been saying things to
his man during the rest believe it or
not but except for the battered look
you would never know that buster mar-
tin was on the floor three times during
that last round and had to be carried
shoot that left



to his corner after the bell the fire
is back in his eyes and hes glaring at
the sailor as if he intended to eat him
lip this buster martin is one sweet
boy for anyones money hes shown
more sheer guts here tonight than weve
seen in the arena in a blue moon hes
leaping oft his stool hes jumping
across the ring its his old trick folks
hes trapped the sailor coming out of
his corner

  with the gong martin had leaped out
as the sailor rose slowly to his feet
he trapped him in the sailors own cor-
ner close to the ropes he was bobbing
and ducking in front of madden and
his hands were flashing in and out tie-
ing up the sailor without touching him
there was a grim look on busters face
he was thinking of what pop had said
that molly girl is over there in the
sailors corner having a circus yeah

  spat without him knowing it his
right flashed out and jarred the sailors
head back he sank his left up to the
glove wrist in maddens middle and
stepping back crashed another right to
the jaw the sailor closed and held
in the clinches madden heeled him
under the chin with the back of his
glove and the laces cut a deep gash in
busters upper lip he could hear the
shrill voice of molly she was scream-
ing at the top of her voice

  kill the big boob sailor sock him
one for me-

  the sound gave new strength to
his weary arms he lashed out with a
straight right and the sailor slipped to
one knee the referee waved martin
away and the house was filled with so
many gibbering lunatics he stepped
back panting and eager he felt his
legs trembling and his arms were
powerless the sailor was up and com-
ing in

  as he lunged in martin jabbed him
to the sore nose with three rapid lefts
and laughed aloud as he saw the blood
spurt anew the sailor was again
mouthing expletives he was slamming
away at martins body each blow hurt-

ing and each blow taking some of the
little stamina left in the battered body
of buster martin he knew that he
was at the end of his rope the
thought drove him mad in another
round he would not have enough
strength left to drive home a finishing
punch even if madden gave him the
opening

  he stepped in desperately and swung
madden crashed through his guard with
a pounding left to the jaw again the
world rocked and swayed and a shrill
laugh came to him-mollys laugh he
bobbed his head and threw a right hook
at the sailors body he heard madden
grunt he lashed out with an over-
hand left and knew that it had found
the sailors jaw then the sailor
reached him with another of those pile-
driving rights to the heart

   in condition and hard as nails buster
would have laughed off such a punch
tonight they landed with a crushing
force his knees sagged and his hands
dropped to his sides quick as a flash
madden leaped in sensing the moment
his left and right thudded against bus-
ters jaw-even while buster was
crumbling from the body blow the
world spun and the blinding lights were
sickening like a ship at sea rocking
in the storm he could hear cassidys
voice pleading with him

  get up buster get up get up or
ill throw in the sponge

  martin stirred his pain racked body
at four it was a quiver of punch
drunk muscles and nerves to the ring
siders to buster it was a titan effort
to stand erect his legs refused to
work his brain was dead he was
sobbing his lungs were like furnaces
burning him cruelly with each indrawn
breath he knew that he was licked-
for the first time in his life out
beaten the referee was saying
seven

  he was on his side in maddens cor-
ner dimly he sawthe snarling face
of spike otoole grinning at him and
then he saw molly oconnor and he


fight stories

eyes were glowing and her fists doubled

  get up you mamas boy she was
screaming full in his face-not ten feet
distant get up you bum sport get
up and take your medicine from a bet-
ter man stop dogging it you quitter
oh you yellow dog

  he was on his feet without looking
around he didnt even know where the
sailor was standing he couldnt see
the lights were still reeling he felt
the strength of ten giants his heart
was aflame bum sport eh-yellow
dog he groped about with his two
hands a thudding blow landed behind
his ear and he whirled punches had
lost the power to hurt him a crashing
left landed on his jaw and he shook it
off waded in he had found madden
his gloves were touching him

  his head was clearing a little he
could hear hear the shouts and growls
and cries from the house hear the bed-
lam of noise as madden broke ground
under his attack and retreated across the
ring madden had a puzzled look on
his face he couldnt understand how
this boy could keep getting up spike
otoole was chewing his cigar and
swallowing the raw leaf cassidy was
shrieking his face purple

  shoot at left buster shoot at left i
the left boy-the left

chapter xv
molly wins a decision

faintly buster heard pops voice
what the left oh yes-the left
-the old trick pop had taught him in
the beginning prop em up with a left
jab and drop em with the right he
was fighting like an automaton but
he was fighting with fury driving the
sailor across the ring beating at his face
and body with a never-ending storm of
short rights and lefts in the center of
the ring he stopped short and gave the
sailor time to open up then he stepped
in and measured him his left flicked

out a short snappy left jab just as it
always flicked out and before it landed
on its target the right was on its way
following it up

  the left tilted the sailors head up so
that his jaw was exposed for the frac-
tion of a second and then the crashing
right drove home-the good old right
hand that knew when hay was to be
made the hard bone of the sailors
jaw under his glove sent a wave of
exultation over martin he closed in-
but he stumbled over something on the
floor he was still fighting slashing out
with his hands but the sailor wasnt
there and the knock-down timekeeper
was counting two the referee was
pushing buster to his corner so he could
go on with the count

  as it was madden got a longer count
than he was entitled to due to martins
numbed brain but he didnt stir and a
stunned spike otoole pulled him
bodily to his corner when the fight was
over-when the referee had counted the
final ten-and out

  a raging mob descended upon the
ring to carry martin to the dressing
room on the way in he passed out
completely the police had to carry
him the rest of the way and place him
on the rub-down table so pop cassidy
moan cassidy in all truth on this
occasion could go to work on him

  outside the frenzied mob pounded on
the door and demanded entrance to the
idols dressing room but pop ignored
the clamor he was ministering with the
tender hands of a woman to the battered
body of his boy

it was not until the next morning that
buster was really able to listen to
anything it was not until he awoke
from a pain-racked sleep in which he
continued the fight of the night before
that he knew that he was buster mar-
tin lightweight champion of the
world a champion the newspapers
heralded as the greatest of them all
a boy that hasnt sense enough to know
when hes knocked out-and goes on
shoot that left



fighting with his heart he read the
papers all of them as any boy would
do the morning after he happened to
become the lightweight champion of the
world

  i heard you yell use at left bus-
ter and i did it just like you showed
me a million times he told cassidy
and then i found myself wonderin
why i couldnt hit him any more he
wasnt there

  pop cassidy grinned happily he
was on the floor and i was the manager
of a worlds champion

  pop im awful glad for your sake
said the happy kid im more glad
than i am for myself its your chance
to laugh at the guys that laughed at you
for so many years

  cassidy was serious and silent for a
long moment he patted buster on the
back listen boy theres another
friend of yours out here that would like
to shake your hand and wish you luck
dont be too hard and everything that
she did yesterday and last night i knew
about in advance and told her to do it-
to help you lick madden

  who is it demanded buster sus-
piciously

  never mind who it is answered

cassidy just remember what im tell-
in you i knew about the whole thing
and i planned it all with her help to save
you from yourself it was the only
chance you had to win i had molly
oconnor trap sailor madden into
steppin into your dressin room before
the fight to give you the razzle-dazzle
i wanted you to think you had been
double-crossed it was a hard job for
molly-but she handled it like a thor-
oughbred after all she won the fight
for you not you or me i want you to
see her-and whatever you do or say to
her-im for her all the way shes a
girl in a million

  cassidy stepped out of the room his
eyes were wet too much happiness in
one day

  in the next room where molly was
waiting he lifted up her face and kissed
her on the forehead you can go in
molly girl he told her i guess it
will be ok

  his eyes flashed for a minute and he
grinned his old grin and you tell that
bird that even if he is the champion of
the world if he dont kiss you the first
minute youre in there ill come in and
lick him myself

  and molly went in

the end

friendship through defeat

before tom sharkeys first fight with jeffries he was absolutely confident
that he would become heavyweight champion of the world the tremendously
powerful young sailor fairly bubbled over with strength and vitality and cock-
sureness

    for weeks after the decision was given against him he was actually heart-
broken he moped around brooding he hated jeffries with a consuming bitter-
ness when he signed to meet the big boilermaker for the second time that bout
could have been billed in all honesty as a grudge fight

    it was as hard fought as the first sharkey came out of it with three broken
ribs but he came out with the grudge missing he was a fighting man first last
and all the time and he appreciated a fighter more than anything else in the world

    tom found jim jeffries a great fighting man a man who took the worst he
had to give and came back for more and his hatred was swallowed up in admira-
tion he found it impossible to dislike a man who fought as well as big jim did
and they became fast friends

  the durable dane

by jack kofoed

battling nelson-a fighter who made the fans break up their chairs his
attack was his defense he never took a backward step in the ring begin
the amazing life-story of this fighting flame here-part 

the sun shone hotly from the
blue sky on a wooden arena in
colma where two nearly naked
men were fighting

  one was deep-chested and handsome
the lines of his body were well
rounded he was beautiful as an athlete
is beautiful clear-eyed graceful the
other looked smaller his face was
weazened his neck thin the wiry
bristles of his almost colorless hair
stuck out at all angles

  they were the actors in one of the
most dramatic battles the history of the
ring has ever recorded

 the handsome man was jimmy
britt the drawn and scrubby one bat-
tling nelson nelson moved forward
always forward he had no defense to

speak of britt hit him at will nelson
continued to move forward no matter
how hard or how often britt punched
he bored in just the same jimmy kept
backing away smashing him cruel
blows and always he kept advancing

  once inside britts arms nelson
went to work punch punch punch
right and left to stomach and kidney
and short hard uppercuts to the jaw
in the clinches nelson did all the fight-
ing while britt strove to protect him-
self jimmy wanted to box at long
range the battler would have none of
it he started to fight his way inside
the moment the referee forced them
apart

  britt landed six blows to nelsons
one they were hard blows for the




fight stories

pride of the pacific coast had a left
hand like a foil and a right with the
hint of dynamite in it

   at times nelsons expressionless face
was a crimson jelly under the thud of
britts sodden gloves there were times
when even his greek body seemed to
be stung through and through by the
merciless flogging but he never
stopped going forward the roughest
toughest lightweight champion that ever
lived was working at his trade he took
no account of the rounds there was
no need of accounting for it was a fight
to a finish

   through all of it britt paid no heed
to his seconds wildly they urged him
to caution in the earlier rounds but
jimmy sought to stop his opponent by
main strength he boxed but it was
not the cautious defensive boxing he
had shown in other fights he was wag-
ing his own war win or lose the credit
would be his

  in the sixth nelson punched britt
groggy the gong saved him another
minute and he would have been done

  the rest did wonders for him he
recuperated amazingly nelson needed
no recuperation he had neither tired
nor wilted under the constant punching
he was as strong and almost as fresh
as when he started

   in the succeeding rounds britt could
do nothing with nelson he hit him a
thousand blows in the matter of points
he was far ahead but points meant
nothing jimmy was not hurting the
battler not slowing him down in the
least and that meant he was losing-
grimly and gamely but losing just the
same

  so the fight went the crowd was
all for him it cheered every move he
made even the newspaper men in the
press row were praying for him for
jimmy britt was the idol of the coast
and nelson was almost an unknown
he was soon to be known throughout
the world however

  in the fourteenth britt went groggy
again he forgot to box he forgot

everything but the necessity of slaying
the tight-lipped man who was continu-
ally crowding up against him of clos-
ing the terrible blue eyes that flamed
into his he fought like a madman
he fought himself out in a hopeless
rally

  in the fifteenth britt resumed his
boxing he tried to stall to rest but
the inhuman fighting machine before
him would not let him rest jimmy
would throw all his weight back of a
punch it would land squarely on the
danes chin but the head coming for-
ward in advance of the body met the
blow rigidly it never snapped back
nothing britt could do seemed capable
of snapping it back

  so through the next three rounds
his friends gave up hope his father
standing in that crowded arena like a
mourner at a funeral had long since re-
signed himself to the inevitable

  in the eighteenth came the high
climax of that bitter fight nelson fol-
lowing the one plan he knew waded
into the showering blows-the blows
that had weakened and softened with
the passing of the rounds the body
the body that was the target that
was always the place to hit

  a couple of lefts to the stomach
brought britts head forwaru as it
came in nelson showered clubby rights
and lefts to the jaw another left to
the body a right to the jaw-the body
again-

  jimmy sank to the floor and rolled
over his tongue protruded he
grasped the ropes and tried to rise but
there was no more strength left in his
arms and legs nelson a smile on his
battered face looked down at him

  he did not hear the gloating roar
from the fifteen thousand in the colma
arena they hailed him-battling nel-
son cushions from the hard seats
rained through the air the ring filled
with jubilant men who swept him up
on their shoulders nelson hardly
seemed to notice it

  he had a strange sort of concentra-
the durable dane



tion though not much more than a
boy in years-he was twenty-five-he
had been fighting his way toward this
moment for ten of them ten years is
a long time when they are filled with
hard knocks nelson had always faced
hard knocks in the same manner that he
had faced the flying fists of jimmy
britt

  it was the biggest moment of his life
bigger even than that happy day he fin-
ished the old master joe gans the
battler had a high contempt for britt
the boxer rather than the fighter it
brought him the keenest personal joy to
win

for fighting was nelsons trade and
there was never another just like
him the greatest lightweight the ring
ever saw was this little man with his
straw-colored hair and the strangest
blue eyes in all the world he was slim
and not very rugged in appearance with
the biceps of a dry goods clerk who
had taken up physical culture

  yet battling nelson was the rough-
est toughest old wolf of them all he
wasnt pretty to watch for all his
slimness he was awkward as a great
dane puppy he wasnt clever or par-
ticularly fast

  he tore in whaling away with both
hands smashes to the head and body
here there everywhere nelson had
no defense he pushed in against the
punches hooked and swung so fast
and often that only a small proportion
of his blows were necessary to wear the
other fellow down

  his left arm had been injured so
he couldnt bend the elbow for block-
ing so he would keep turning his
head to stop the blows with his neck
and ears it turned those ears into
grotesque deformities but while he was
in the ring he didnt mind that

  the battler was rough he always
came into action with a two- or three-
day growth of whiskers on his jowls-
a trick that jack dempsey emulated
years later in the clinches he would

  scrape those bristly whiskers against
his opponents neck and chest time after
time in every clinch after a bit blood
would seep through the scratched skin
his dry wiry hair would get in the
other fellows eyes and all the time
he would be hammering away with both
hands

  rough tough never stopping
no one could hiyt him no matter how
they cut and slashed his face and body
into shreds and his eyes

  jimmy britt said of them-and
jimmy should know having fought
nelson four times-they were un-
canny expressionless they looked
through you instead of at you they
were so expressionless that they might
have been the eyes of a dead man an-
other thing they never blinked when
you stab a left into a fellows nose or
cross a right to his chin he cant help
blinking nelson never did no mat-
ter how fast the punches were coming
his eyes were wide open and staring
it began to get you after a while you
began to believe that the guy wasnt
human say for days after a fight
with nelson i couldnt see anything but
his eyes

  its a lot to say of any man that he
is the best that ever came along at his
particular game there was not a
lightweight champion in the whole pack
who didnt know more about boxing
than battling nelson there probably
wasnt one who could not make a fool
of him in six rounds outpoint him in
ten have none the worse of it in fifteen

  but if you tossed any of them into
the ring with the durable dane in a
fight to a finish one man would be car-
ried out and one would walk-and the
walker would be battling nelson

kid lavigne was just as game as
nelson a harder hitter and faster on
his feet he was a rugged soul too
joe walcott fairly murdered him in the
early rounds of their historic fight at
maspeth lavignes left ear was hang-
ing by a shred he was scarcely recog-
nizable but he fought a stern uphill


fight stories

battle and beat the barbadoes demon
that indicated plenty of ability to take
punishment but the saginaw kid didnt
fight nearly as much as nelson nor did
he last as long

  frank erne would have given him a
good fight but the battler would have
worn him down joe gans was not
far from his best when he traveled
those forty-two hot rounds in the ne-
vada desert yet he was on the floor at
the finish-knocked out f a man ever
was even though the referee did give
him the decision on a foul

  wolgast was of the same type as nel-
son and jlavigne but he crumbled fast
once the break came great ringman
though benny leonard was it isnt
likely that he could have licked the
battler where harder hitters failed and
certainly he was not cut out for the
finish fights that were once popular

  as for goodrich kansas and man-
dell we can dismiss them as we have
the others they were not built to
travel the derby route

  nelson was as honest as the day
there was never the faintest hint of
suspicion against him in the years he
waged wars in rings from new york
to frisco before the first fight with
gans at goldfield a gambler offered him
a large sum to quit if he would lay
down he would be independent for life

  nelson rose up in the wildest wrath
and kicked that gambler down the steps
he had no education in the accepted
sense of the term but possessed sound
native intelligence he owned a mining
company ran a town and wrote a book
in addition to winning the lightweight
championship of the world a record
that many a more pretentious man
might envy

  yes battling nelson was a diamond
in the rough-the roughest on record

  this two-fisted slugger was and is
-you get in the habit of past tensing
a fighter when he has been out of the
racket very long-a generous fellow
when the san francisco earthquake
came along he sent a check for 

  to the relief fund which was a lot
more than some professional philan-
thropists did he once traveled clear
across the continent to box in a bene-
fit for the newsboys of new york

  no one ever won a fistic champion-
ship without passing through a lot of
bitter travail hard work and disappoint-
ment nelson came from nowhere to
the pinnacle of athletic fame twenty
years ago he was known as the richest
fighter on record though his quarter
of a million would not be so highly
rated now it represented a greater
achievement to get it together than it
was for gene tunney to earn his mil-
lion in these days of high finance

  it isnt my job to paint bat nelson
as an angel he was anything but that
he didnt drink or smoke but no man
who has gone on the road as a kid
fought his way along as a meat-cutter
waiter prize-fighter and what-not can be
a little lord fauntleroy but he was
game and honest and never whimpered
if he was an egoist he was also a doer

  and he was the greatest fighting
lightweight champion we ever had

  it seems to me that there can be no
dispute on this point he fought ihe
longest championship fights in modern
history he beat the greatest men of
his time-gans mcgovern britt cor-
bett herrera canole hanlon he
took more punishment than any other
champion who ever lived and yet his
unbelievable ruggedness carried him
through twenty years of competition

  he was one of the most picturesque
of all champions a man who never
backed up who never believed any chap
of his weight could whip him jack
london called him the abysmal brute
by this he meant that battling nelson
was soaked with that basic thing that
is the very center of life-movement
no matter what comes the abysmal
brute will move

  no one who saw nelson in his last
great effort against wolgast can doubt
that london was right blinded beaten
to a pulp hopeless almost helpless
the durable dane



nelson following the one plan he knew waded into the showering blows-the
blows that had weakened with the passing of the rounds

 he continued to move against his foe
 the durable dane

 the man who coined that nickname
 knew what he was talking about

 theres a line of kiplings that runs
 through my mind-a line describing
 bendigo a champion of england back
 in the bare-knuckle days

 bendys short for bendigo you
    should see him peel

 half of him was whalebone and
    half of him was steel

fight stories

have had something to do with starting
him on a fighting career that his fam-
ily took him to illinois when he was
only a year old and eventually settled in
hegewisch certainly had much to do
with it

  hegewisch was a fighting town
meat packing and ice-cutting were the
principal industries and that sort of
work makes for strong muscles when
you get a lot of husky youngsters to-
gether there is bound to be fighting

  bat quit the henry clay public school
when he was thirteen to drive the horses
used for hauling ice he was paid
ninety cents a week which looked like
a small fortune to him his employer
john daline recognizing the kids en-
ergy and trustworthiness increased his
wage until he was getting one dollar a
day by the time he quit to enter the em-
ploy of the g h hammond company
for this employer nelson became suc-
cessively driver cutter timekeeper and
assistant foreman

  the scandinavians are a conscien-
tious hard-working breed bat never
looked for any the best of it and the
hard work in the outdoors helped mould
him into a much stronger youngster
than his slim build indicated

  it was in september  that
wallaces circus made a one-day stand
at hammond which is just around the
corner from hegewisch in a manner of
speaking practically every boy in
hegewisch walked to hammond to see
that show because of the hot weather
the meat-cutters-of which brigade
young nelson was one-were working
only three days a week so bat hied
himself over with the gang marched in
the street parade with a banner and
afterward carried water for the ele-
phants for this each youngster was
rewarded with passes to the show

  wallaces circus was no dazzling af-
fair or wouldnt have been to metro-
politan eyes the costumes were shabby
and the elephants wore a moth-eaten
look but to battling nelsons eager
gaze it was a carnival of grandeur yet

an even bigger attraction than the circus
itself was a supposedly world renowned
pugilist who was traveling with the
show

  no one knew who this fellow was
but the circus billed him as wallaces
unknown he was a tough-looking
chap compactly built and as hard as
kid broad i guess he was the first
real prize-fighter nelson had ever seen
at any rate the boy was thrilled to his
bones at the thought of watching him in
action though only fourteen years
old bat was the cock o the walk in his
home town and already thoughts of a
ring career were flickering and buzzing
around in his head

  in these days they talk a lot about
gene tunneys supreme confidence
the present heavyweight champion of
the world is sure of himself but he was
never as complete an egoist as battling
nelson even when that young man was
at the immature age of fourteen

  quite casually he offered to fight the
great unknown for the dollar given any
one who lasted three rounds imagine
the supreme gall of the youngster so
far as nelson knew this fellow might
have been a worlds champion amusing
himself by a tour incognitio his ex-
perience was limited and he didnt know
that worlds champions are the last peo-
ple in the world to do such a thing his
ignorance made the exploit doubly
daring

  wearing a frayed red sweater and
rubber-soled shoes little bat walked out
into the sawdust arena to face the
killer the tent was packed and to
the accompaniment of roaring lions a
band that struggled through down
went mcginty and the yelps of the
crowd the greatest lightweight of them
all made his fighting start

  of course the unknown was not
afraid of this youngster he rushed
grimacing fiercely intent on getting the
job over and done with nelson met
that rush squarely his left hand held
out in the approved manner back
went the unknowns head his nose
the durable dane



streaming blood nelson was on top
of him instantly with a cracking right
under the heart that had the profes-
sional gasping and floundering he was
game though and came back but bat
again jabbed with his left and coun-
tered with a right to the stomach down
went the unknown completely out

  old man wallace paid over the
promised dollar but there wras little
profit in that wthile bat was making
his first step toward the championship
of the world one of the circus hands
stole his coat which contained his
weeks salary of  and a water-
bury watch

the circus owner wanted bat to
play the role of the great un-
known for the balance of the tour he
even offered fifty dollars a week and
expenses-an unparalleled offer for a
fourteen-year-old in the fading days of
the nineteenth century--but old nels
nelson wouldnt listen to it his boy
was too young for such foolishness he
must stay at home

  well that was all right with bat he
was having a good time in hegewisch
and the call of the road had not yet
taken hold of him

  his victor over wallaces prize-
fighter started a great interest in box-
ing around his neighborhood the
white house club an athletic organi-
zation was started with nelson as the
prize boxer

  the population of the town was about
equally divided between danes and
swedes there never has been much
love lost between these peoples and the
latter rallied around a rough young
fellow named ole olson to counteract
the ballyhoo the danes were making
over nelson

  so a match was made for a purse of
three dollars and one sunday afternoon
the entire male population of hegewisch
turned out to see the fight olson had
height weight and reach on his rival
which about balanced the reputation
nelson had made by knocking out the

unknown pay envelopes were rifled
for betting money and the excitement
was so great that men were taking pot-
shots at each other all over town

  olson knew no more about the sci-
ence of boxing than nelson did he
tore in and bat met him flat-footed
for two rounds ole swarmed all over
the kid they battered away at each
other like a couple of wild men but
in the third nelson beat the swede
down with a flurry of short arm
punches to the body

  that precipitated a riot the spec-
tators nervously excited about the fight
and keyed to a higher pitch by the short
and desperate struggle began a battle
royal among themselves nelson went
into the forefront of that and led the
danes to victor- over the swedes

  rough and tough tireless a boy
who really loved to fight

  there was too much fight talk around
the nelson household those hard-
working and conscientious folk had no
time for the ring they saw no glory
or money or advancement of any sort
in it for their son they thought he
would get hurt

  bat kept on talking though his
two victories had brought him only four
dollars but money wasnt everything
by this time he was working as a black-
smiths helper in one of the hegewisch
shops and the stir of adventure was
whipping up his blood you cant ex-
plain that sort of thing to your mother
-not so shell understand anyway

  one day a fly-- g iron fragment from
a broken machine struck bat in the face
laying it open he was taken more
dead than alive to the mercy hospital
where he lay unconscious for forty-
eight hours he came out a couple of
weeks later through with that sort of
work fie wanted to fight

  wrhen mrs nelson protested he said
aw ma look at the risks i ran in the
shop boxing cant be as dangerous as
that

  somehow or other the argument
didnt convince her and a few days


fight stories

after his fifteenth birthday battling
nelson ran away from home

  he beat his way by slow stages to
huron south dakota most of the
romance had gone out of the road for
him by that time there was no fight-
ing to do in that part of the country
except the street corner kind that al-
ways crops up when hot-blooded youth
gets together

  so bat went to work as a helper in
a butcher shop at fifteen dollars a
month that was his occupation until
christmas when his demand for five
dollars a month more being refused he
tossed up the job and went to work as a
cowboy on a nearby ranch

  the war with spain came down like
a thunderclap on the country every-
one was in a fervor of patriotic excite-
ment a volunteer company was formed
in huron they werent finicky about
a persons age so bat nelson slipped in
and became a soldier overnight the
warriors traveled down to sioux falls
where for some reason or other the
captain was rejected and his men who
had agreed to follow him to the finish
returned home with him

  that visit to sioux falls gave nel-
son an idea there was a boxing club
there and bat had by no means decided
to give up the game he finished up
the winter months as a waiter in the
vanderbilt hotel in miller but when
spring began to tint the world with
green he went to sioux falls

  at that time a shifty raw-boned
long-armed fellow named freddy green
was the particular pet and idol of the
fans he was called the champion of
the dakotas nelson had never heard
of him until he wandered into the falls
it wouldnt have made any difference if
he had the idea never entered his
shaggy head that he need be afraid of
any one his blue eyes would not have
wavered had he been tossed in with kid
lavigne then lightweight champion of
the world

  the manager of the club was glad to
match bat with freddy green since

there were not so many fighters around
who wanted to risk themselves with that
young man

  all right kid he said ill take a
chance with you if you make good ill
let you fight soldier williams next day
at our annual picnic

  no more ragged red sweaters and
baggy trousers as a fighting costume for
battling -nelson he bought himself
regulation ring shoes and a pair of green
trunks

  sixteen in that short span of time
a boxer cowboy soldier casual worker
-yes nelson took life by the throat in
his tenderest years

  now against the champion of the
dakotas he was to make his debut in a
real ring in real fighting togs-quite
sure that he had taken the first step
toward the goal that beckoned him on
since he stood watching wallaces un-
known writhe and squirm in the saw-
dust of the big top

chapter iii
the lure of the game

green was a boxer he danced
around the awkward youngster
poking him with a left jab then slipping
away it was all new stuff to nelson
the unknown and olson had rushed
at him as eagerly as he went at them
this was a different sort of game

  bat kept chasing and freddy kept
sprinting and outboxing him in the
fourth round the blood spurted from
nelsons nose under the continuous
thumping it made him wild with rage
for it was the first time such an indig-
nity had been visited upon him but
only in the clinches could he do any
effective work the rest of the time
he was missing too frequently

  then nelson proved that he had ring
instinct as well as courage he was
beginning to get a little weary so he
laid back and green under the im-
pression that the kid was all in hast-
the durable dane



ened to the slaughter he stopped box-
ing and started to trade punches that
was where he made his mistake

  the dane met him with a volley of
body blows that struck freddy with
panic and forced him to hang on the
bell saved him further punishment

  the seventh round saw the finish
green came out a pretty weak and tired
lad he tried to back-pedal but nelson
was at him like a catamount whanging
away with both hands

  a left hook to the jaw finally turned
the trick and the champion of the da-
kotas went down for the long count

  the manager collected  by pass-
ing the hat among the spectators and
asked bat if he was willing to fight
soldier williams at the picnic next day
he offered to raise the ante to ten dol-
lars

  in these days careful athletic com-
missions will not permit boxers to go
into the ring without several days rest
and many a fighter thinks one bout a
month pretty strenuous campaigning
not this rough young fellow from
hegewisch though stiff and a little
tired from the hard scrap of the night
before nelson rose early and hied him-
self to the picnic grounds his victory
over green was a tonic that lifted him
to the heights

  williams knew no more about boxing
than nelson did he came out of his
corner both hands swinging the
battler met him with a grin of pure
joy that sort of stuff was right down
his alley he doted on it

  but williams was strong as a bull
and much the more experienced man
up to the sixth round he had a bit the
better of it he was weakening
though the pace was faster than he
was used to on the other hand nel-
son had no tire in him and kept coming
faster and faster

  in the seventh bat landed a sharp
right to the stomach then stepped back
to see if the soldier would follow him
instead the puffing warrior retreated

  ah ha said nelson to himself
  r-jone-

youre a quitter are you he came
rushing back once with a whirl of
hooks crosses and uppercuts to face and
body williams wilted under it tried
to run and was saved by the bell as
green had been the night before

  the respite was only temporary the
eighth round was not a minute old be-
fore the referee counted him out and
battling nelson had scored his fourth
straight knockout

about that time the kid began to
get a bit homesick he was only
sixteen after all and he wanted to see
his folks and chum around with the
boys so he rode the freights back to
hegewisch where he was given the
time honored welcome of the prodigal
son

  even the earth-worn nels nelson
must have realized that his son was a
youngster with the sort of determina-
tion that brooked no stopping bat
wanted to be a fighter neither his
fathers anger nor his mothers tears
could stop him if they thought he
was following a dreary track to the rain-
bows end the boy had a different idea
so verbal opposition was dropped and
nelson made a fistic reappearance be-
fore the home folks

  he boxed a six-round draw with
eddie herman in hegewisch and the
draw decision was nothing in the way
of a break for him eddie a smart
boxer made a fool of bat for the first
three rounds after that the dane bat-
tered him from pillar to post and at
the finish herman was a gory sight
had the bout been scheduled for ten
rounds nelson would undoubtedly have
scored another knockout

  so far he had given no thought to
the big cities confident as he was of
his own ability he knew that outside
his own bailiwick and up in dakota
he was not a drawing card but now
he turned those blue eyes of his on
chicago

  hegewisch is one of the many small
towns that snuggle around the south-


fight stories

era outposts of that city it isnt so
much of a trip into the loop and at
the moment nelson had no desire for
long and tiresome trips

  eddie penny had been cleaning up
most of the second-rate lightweights in
chicago he didnt feel any call to be
afraid of the tow-headed kid from
hegewisch and when a match was of-
fered he willingly agreed they met on
the south side and bats victory was
quite as decisive as the first one over
wallaces unknown

  nelson walked right into penny bat-
tered him with both hands and finished
him off in less than a round in the
following month he stopped bull win-
ters in even a shorter time and topped
off his chicago debut by knocking out
a fellow named john smith in the sec-
ond 

  these three victories netted him ex-
actly fifteen dollars the method of pay-
ing a fighter at that time being to pass
the hat since all of bats victims
were favorites of the crowd the folks
assembled were not in a mood to give
him much reward

  nelson wasnt discouraged nothing
could discourage him though the re-
wards of the moment were meagre in-
deed he knew that ringmen did earn
large sums of money if other men
had done that he could too the boy
reasoned he felt that destiny had
pointed him out	

  but for more than a year no fights
came his way he stayed home and
worked trained at the old white house
club and took one gorgeous hunting
trip in the northwest the outdoor life
and hard physical work and consistent
training were building him up he was
only eighteen and had plenty of time
ahead of him

the year of  marked the end
of nelsons sporadic ring efforts
he began to fight regularly he started
on the first step of the ladder

  he agreed to fight a negro named
feathers vernon at dalton illinois

six rounds for ten dollars it wasnt
much of a fight for feathers ran and
ducked and clinched throughout bat
was given the decision just as the
president of the club was about to hand
him the ten dollars a fight started the
money was knocked out of his hand
nelson managed to retrieve a dollar and
a half but the bill was so badly tom
that he was not able to pass it

  though his financial reward for that
bout was only fifty cents it was not en-
tirely a wasted day in the free-for-all
nelson went to work and whipped half
a dozen men for the sheer pleasure of
it

  then glory of glories the manager
of the star theater in chicago offered
him fifteen dollars for a windup match
with charley dougherty it was like
a gift of the gods nelson accepted
with avidity and knocked dougherty
out in a round

  they brought him back for a bout
with joe hedmark

  the fight with hedmark was the first
bit of tragedy to come into nelsons
career afterward he said that joe was
a combination of terry mcgovern and
dal hawkins an exaggeration cer-
tainly but he must have seemed some-
thing like that to the inexperienced
country boy

  at any rate hedmark was strong
fast and a good puncher he was tal-
ler stronger and had been in the game
much longer nelson fought harder
than he had done in any of his other
battles but was doomed to defeat from
the start

  as usual bat came out swinging and
hedmark let go a right uppercut with
every ounce of his strength behind it
down went battling nelson for the first
time in his life it was a greater indig-
nity than the blood freddy green had
drawn from his nose he came up
clawing like a wildcat mad clean
through

  nelson kept going forward all the
time but he couldnt reach his target
and joe pelted away with both hands at
the durable dane



his face and ribs they finished the
last round fighting like madmen in the
center of the ring but there was no
dissenting voice when the referee raised
hedmarks hand he had won with
plenty to spare and even battling nel-
son admitted it

  in the matter of knockdowns it prob-
ably set a record hedmark dropped
the dane seventeen times in six rounds
and in turn was floored on five occa-
sions twenty-two visits to the canvas
in a six-round bout ought to be a rec-
ord if it isnt one

  nelson was paid fifteen dollars-or
about eightv-eight cents a knockdown
you can hardly buy that sort of thing
today at any price

  just a week later bat went on with
harry griffin in the same ring and
dropped his opponent thirteen times
without being able to put him away
when you consider there were thirty-
five knockdowns in twelve rounds of
fighting its easy to understand why
nelson was becoming popular with the
chicago crowds

  his remaining fights in  were
successful enough from an artistic but
not a financial standpoint young bay
one of the best lightweights in the
middle west clarence class ed bur-
ley danny mcmahon black griffo and
jack martin caused him no particular
trouble pete boyle when on the verge
of being stopped was awarded the fight
on a foul by referee george siler

  the day he lost to boyle nelson for
the only time in his life fought two
battles in one day as soon as he had
been disqualified he changed into his
street clothes hopped a trolley car and
went to the hibernian club where he
fought four rounds with mcmahon

  for these fights nelson was paid ten
dollars that wasnt cake and coffee
money even in those days

  the battler was beginning to find out
one thing he wasnt cut out for the
six-round game he needed distance
in which his superb vitality would give
him a chance to come from behind the

clever men could outbox him over the
short route even the frailer ones
would not tire much in six rounds

  fifteen rounds twenty finish
fights that was the dream lurking in
his tousled head even then but in his
section of the country six rounds was
the standard had it been the standard
everywhere battling nelson would never
have risen to fame he would have
been just another strong rough medi-
ocrity they couldnt possibly know
that in a finish fight he was the greatest
lightweight of them all

chapter iv
the fight at rheinlander

nobody knew that of course
the promoters knew it least of
all apparently for up to this time the
largest sum he had been paid for a fight
was thirty-five dollars then quite un-
expectedly nelson went up into the
three-figure class

  he fought a tough young irishman
named mickey riley in milwaukee for
a guarantee of thirty-five dollars
mickey was pretty smart and kept out
of reach for the six rounds the ref-
eree gave him the decision and it was
a most unpopular one following the
storm of hoots and boos came a rain of
silver and small bills the battler
netted  which was approximately
the value of the united states treasury
in his eyes

  lurking in his simple heart was the
desire to be a beau brummel after
the fight he togged himself out in a
seven-dollar suit a derby and a new pair
of shoes and trod the boulevards to
give the natives a treat

  you must understand that even so
rugged a soul as battling nelson could
not possibly have lived on his ring earn-
ings at that time even with such occa-
sional windfalls he was working for
the hawley down draft furnace com-
pany on the north side of chicago


fight stories

swinging a sledge for eight hours a day
that was all the training he got gym-
nasiums and road work and balanced
diets were beyond his range on the
afternoon of fight night he would get
off early for a bath and haircut and was
ready to go any distance when he
traveled to milwaukee he took the whole
day off

  his brother johnny and charley
peterson used to come up from hege-
wisch to second him so there was no
money wasted on handlers there
couldnt be for bat made it a rule to
send half his purses to his mother

  after the victories there was little
margin for celebration either except
for a meal at flynn brothers restaurant
on state street the flynns were big-
hearted irishmen and they liked the
tow-headed kid from hegewisch if
he had money he could pay if he didnt
they wrote it on the ice

  early in may  nelson went to
omro a little wisconsin town to fight
harry fails it was only a six-round
no-decision affair but it was so-bitterly
contested that the fans demanded an
encore

  that was satisfactory to all parties
save the sheriff of the county the
sheriff himself was not particularly op-
posed to a little setto but he had been
given orders to stop it if he didnt off
would come his official head he also
informed the fighters that if they went
through with the bout he would per-
sonally see that they served a little time
in the penitentiary

  that scared both the boys they
were eager to fight but didnt want to
get in trouble over it the fellows pro-
moting the affair decided that they could
all go over to rheinlander just across
the county line and then the sheriff
could not interfere

  all the horsedrawn vehicles in omro
were hired and they started out in
the excitement no provision was made
to transport the fighters all the rigs
were full nobody offered them a seat
some of the bigger-hearted bumpkins

said they could ride on the laps of the
passengers if they had a mind to both
harry and bat decided to walk they
thought it would be good training

  suddenly it began to snow hard it
came down so thick and fast that they
could hardly see fifty feet ahead of
them an icy wind was whipping down
from the north and there was four or
five miles to go

  bat had never seen snow in may be-
fore he had no overcoat and the
seven-dollar suit was no great protec-
tion against the elements by the time
the boys reached the barn where they
were to fight they were so stiff with the
cold that they could hardly move the
barn itself was a pretty chilly place no
spot for a man in nothing but trunks
and shoes to stand around

  every one of the spectators had a bet
down and the gangling fellow who
owned the place was appointed referee
the crowd howled through the ten
rounds bat and harry were stirred
by the excitement but more by their
rivalry and the need to keep warm
they fought like a couple of bob-cats
at the finish they were both strong and
fit

  the referee raised both their right
hands exclaiming even up boys-
hang fiddle if she wasnt

  no purse had been arranged for
fighters in those days werent very
good business men you know but the
wisconsin fans were sports and real-
ized that they had been treated to a
great scrap they began to toss money
into the ring and the erstwhile enemies
turning from blows to finance began
scrambling over the floor to pick it up
there were a lot of cracks and some
of the coins rolled into them

  the money had been too hard-earned
to let it escape so easily they bor-
rowed a hammer and pinch-bar and
pried up the boards so that not a penny
would be missed when it was all piled
up and divided they each had  it
was the biggest purse so far and one
that nelson was not to better for nearl
the durable dane



two years thats how slow progress
was for the greatest lightweight of them
all

bat did practically no fighting again
until the fall of that year when
he started campaigning in milwaukee
again first with the italian joe per-
cente then with that cagy veteran ed-
die santry santry incidentally later
became bats sparring partner when the
durable dane rose high enough in fistic
ranks to have such luxuries

  the fight was held at the pyramid
athletic club and nelson battered the
veteran around from start to finish
he took every round and in the sixth
knocked eddie down as a matter of
fact santry was on the floor when the
last bell sounded and the referee had
to help him to his feet before lifting his
right glove in the sign of victory

  astounded bat rushed over and
grasped the official by the arm whats
the idea he yelled i won didnt i
why nelson the referee said
santry told me that everything was
fixed up that he was to get the decision
whatever happened

  that was the durable danes first
meeting with anything shady in the
ring all his fights were on the level
no suggestions one way or another had
been made to him lie later found that
there are plenty of pitfalls dug for un-

wary feet that there are sharks in every
line of business but it was a stagger-
ing jolt to him then

  nelson finished off the years cam-
paigning by knocking out a middle-
weight named mike walsh and losing
a point decision to charley berry
the last fight came just before
christmas

  the holiday spirit stirred him bat
was always sentimental about christ-
mas even when he became champion
of the world he never failed to get home
for the holidays or to hang up his stock-
ing so that his old mother could fill it
with presents

  well here he was back home there
were six years of sporadic fighting be-
hind him he was twenty years old
and getting a little battered he had no
money to speak of the fifty dollars he
carried in his pocket representing the
sum total of his wealth he had no
trade he seemed to be getting no-
where in his heart bat felt as sure of
success as ever but so far there was no
outward signs of it

  on christmas morning dad nelson
called his boy into the little parlor and
said now listen bat i want that you
should stop dis fighting mother und
me ve talk it over you had your
chance und make nothin of it now
before you leaf home again you must
promise no more fightin

  that christmas day conversation almost deprived the ring of its greatest
lightweight champion the next installment tells how an argument between
two men he didnt even know kept battling nelson at his trade it tells oo
of his one-second knockout over billy rosser of the one man nelson
never could beat of the rawest deal he ever got of his discovery of the
left-half scissors hook and his debut on the big time against canole
hanlon herrera corbett and jimmy britt

eye one of them hard-cut juttin
heads like a gunboat cleavin the waves
nice pair of shoulders sort of stooped
like theyd followed a plough he
tapers right down to the hips even in
them baggy clothes he was wearin
an though he was leanin against the
wall he seems to stand light an poised
easy on his dogs well he had the
ear-marks

  i was all set to open up an get some
of the dope from him when i hears a
yell from across the gym an looks up
shocker coffee one of the cornin
heavies i had had jus kissed the can-
vas not out or anything jus down
hard the shocker had fought a tough
go with the savannah tar baby couple
of nights ago an he was still some shook
up he waves to iron jaw mccabe-
he was sparrin with him-hes had
enough an climbs through the ropes for
the showers

  i throws a word the shockers way
as he passes an turns back to find this
tow-head gent laughin he points at
the shockers back an i notices the
size of his mitts big an square

  them kind of babies ought to be
peddlin shoelaces he cracks laughin
some more

  jus then iron jaw comes up he

overhears the remark an looks this baby
up an down iron jaw was as square
as they come and the shockers buddy
every saturday night he lays twenty
cold on the shocker an never squawks
a groan when he shells out well he
looks at this guy an speaks up

  thats right buddy an youll never
sell none here

  whats that the tow-head yells
flushin in the neck

  iron jaw squares around shovin out
his under lip which not moren twenty
ham-an-eggers has thickened for him
iron jaw always lasts the full route so
you can figure that lip is pretty good
say dont they speak english where
you hang your hat he inquires

  mebbe the tow-head comes back
an i notice he aint leanin against the
wall no more

  well an iron jaw walks up close
to him i said get out

  the tow-head dont get excited none
instead he jus looks over the iron jaw
like he was something marked -
cheap in one of them second-hand
clothes dens on eighth avenue then
he turns to me smiling it was
easy to see he aint mad or even
sore

  punch drunk eh sends a lot of
em nuts

  ordinarily iron jaws jus like any
other fighting man he dont pick
scraps when he fights he wants to get
paid for it but that one caught him
low it was less than a month since he
buys some oil stock an it turns out
that what was behind that stock was
good for drinking maybe but not much
for lubricating right then some of the
boys had begun to remark as how iron
jaw had been stoppin a pile of punches
with his head iron jaw has heard
some of them cracks so this one dont
help none at all

  it was like walkin into a bulls bou-
doir in red underwear its iron jaws
turn to get hot now an he does he
stalks back to the ring proud an snar-
lin low through that hole where some


fight stories

teeth were missin pie climbs through
the ropes sheds his robe an turns to
the tow head

  you want to step this way mister
he bawls out an ill drink a few of
them punches of vours

  the kid grins at me an says worse
than i thought

  iron jaw gets that one too right on
the button he comes back for more
with the only wise-crack i ever heard
him pull

  most hicks are green he sings out
at this guy youre different you
look yella to me

  well thats enough to start a pretty
good war any place the tow-head
grins some more at me an then begins
strippin off his coat aint had a
work-out today an i might jus as well
he explains

  one of the boys digs him up a pair
of trunks an it aint long before hes
in the ring with iron jaw now get
me right iron jaw may be old an
hes seen better days but theres more
sore hands come from tryin to crack
his jaw than from the rock pile at sing
sing also despite the fact that he
sops up punishment like a thirsty
sponge he carries a right-hand punch
that reminds the boys of cain handlin
abel the works when it lands

well theyre in there this tow-
head bozo aint worried none
an he dont seem mad somebody
cracks the gong one an theyre at it
iron jaw comes wadin in like a truck
horse with fallen arches that round-
house right cocked for the fall of rome
the tow-head-an i didnt make no
mistake about his build its pretty-
starts prancin around shootin light
lefts at iron jaws head might jus
as well waste time tickin a battleship
under a port hole iron jaw unleashes
the right swing a couple of times but
the kid steps away from it like it was
bad news jus once he fools iron
jaw an rolls under it cornin up to poke
one in the bread basket thatd help 

mans indigestion that was the first
round

  iron jaw goes into the second mad-
dern ever an the tow-head aint sore
atall jus prances around grinnin an
pokin a neat left into iron jaws eye
im gettin a good line on the kid i
sees hes flashy with plenty of speed
an good footwork he back-pedals
like a champ an he counters plenty
but theyre all light what that bozo
needs is a punch every once in a
while he steps in an shoots one hard
but hes firin from long distance an
when his glove lands its at the end
of his reach no sting in them kind

  they clinch an i sees the tow-heads
mouth movin i dont know jus what
he says but it was mean for iron
jaw backs off mad like the time the
ump gave him a raw decision up in
yonkers an they called out the dicks

   he plows in primed for man-
slaughter an nails the kid in a corner

  right thens where i learn this kid
can take it iron jaw hits him with
everything in the book takin turns at
his head an his tummy but instead
of pullin his chin into his shoulder an
coverin up hard the tow-head tries to
box he picks some of them off in the
air an blocks a few more but iron
jaws landin hard an plenty an there
aint no room to back pedal easy to
see the kid hasnt done much fightin

  i was thinkin of stoppin the
slaughter before the kid goes down
when  notices its iron jaw whos
breathin hard an wobblin hes hit
the kid so many times hes groggy
from throwin punches he breaks
ground to the middle of the ring an
the tow-head comes out does he tear
in an put the k o on the founderin
iron jaw  does he rush him around
an hand him the works before he gets
set again oh no this babys a
boxer an out to show the world he is
the big dumb-bell stands there sparrin
with a occasional light left to the head
then i glims that sick grin on his face
again-an he makes me mad conceits
battlin beppo

 

written all over him this mangy cor-
respondence-school shadow boxer

  i was standin near the light switch
an right then i gives iron jaw the
high sign he was so groggy i had to
flash it four times before he catches it
he finally does an nods right away
he begins backin up again i see him
cock the old right like a coffin nail an
i presses the button

  when the lights goes on again the
boys was throwing water into the tow-
heads mug an stickin the smellin salts
under his bugle iron jaw had con-
nected perfect with that right swing in
the dark the kids eyes finally rolls
back an opens light blue an inno-
cent

  somebody turned off the lights he
croaks

  oh no i comes right back that
was the punch turned off your lights
maybe ha-ha thats a good one
boys i laughs

  well mister that hicks so dumb he
falls for it jus sits there an rubs his
jaw iron jaws wrorked all the sore-
ness outa his system an steps over to
me

  that baby aint bad he says

  coinin from iron jaw thats a lot
any baby he puts down is rotten in his
opinion i steps up to mister tow-
head an tells the boys to quit drownin
him

  where you fought before kid i
asks him

  right then he puffs out his chest an
straightens up oh i done a lot of
fightin he says important i fought
knockout hogan in kankakee
knocked him out got a decision with
young johnson at rices corners took
louie solomon at rochester in the pre-
lim got a draw with jack milligan at
hammondston over at cortlandt i
licked dynamite lynch also joe cor-
res an sailor cook an-

   cuts him off right away i had
this birds number he was a small-
town pug what had tipped over a few
nobodies in places you never heard of

he thought he was good an classy
any sluggin bean-eater with a few
tricks could take him but he didnt
know it yet he had a lot of speed
seems like he was naturally shifty an
bad a pretty set-up

  say i says my names higgins
you heard of me probably i handled
porky nelson who was almost welter
champ back in  if it hadnt been
for the war-now i know this game
backwards an forwards you aint
good-but you aint bad maybe-with
a little luck-i could make a fighter
outa you what do y say

   well he says serious i been tryin
to ee mr rickard for the last few
days id kinda like to talk to him-
oh tex i cuts in yeah well i
guess i can get you to see him any
time me an tex an i crosses my
fingers

  i got him in the office an begin to
make out the contract fifty-fifty i
says an whats the name

  albon wittleton beppo he says
proud-like

  the deuce it is i fires back
battlin beppo i writes

  well he looks over the papers a bit
holdin them right-side up provin he
could read all right he says slow
but there aint no mention made of
a championship bout you know-
with tunney-or dempsey or some
one

  yeah i know i avs

       chapter ii
       ten and out

ill tell you right now i wasnt doin
no weepin or gnashin of teeth for
signing battlin beppo into my stable
no sir mister he had a pair of them
flat straight legs like dempseys an
when the manassa mauler was at the
top he sure had a pretty pair of pins
then there was them wide slopin
shoulders with power behind em an


fight stories

the kids natural ability well i was
feelin good for the next two weeks an
even dreamin about how good id pho-
tograph standin next to the challenger
for the title

  you see it didnt take me moren a
day to find out the kid had no use for
booze seems his old man had hit it
pretty hard or something   as for the
dames his only regret was he never had
a chance to get the original eve-by
the throat one look at them clean
straight eyes an that open face would
show you he wasnt lyin

  for almost a month i works on him
showin him how to put some pepper in
that jab how to stand in an hammer
them punches so they connects with
steam i takes him down off his toes
a bit he was up so far dancin around
on them he never could get set for a
swat for three days steady i ties
his left to his side an makes him hit
with that right duke hes beginnin
to get the trick now

  footwork i couldnt show him
nothin about he could sidestep em
an back pedal an dance pretty his
feet were fast an always set to get
away an he could pick off punches
in the air like a no-hit champ in a
week he knew how to tie up a guy in
the clinches yeah he learned fast an
seemed to like it

  iron jaw was workin with him every
day regular theyd gotten over their
grudge now an pals around like
brothers iron jaw works him hard
shows him how to gouge a mans eye
how to warm up the kidneys in a
clinch how to stick an elbow in a fel-
las arm an a pile of other helpful
tricks an it was iron jaw who put
me wise to him

  say iron taw says to me one day
as he was workin in his false teeth
this guy wont hook no more he says
dempsey hooked an look where it got
him

  yeah i ponders whats he
wanta do

  jab an straight punch iron jaw

explains says that beats a hook seven
days a week

  i corners beppo a little later an
asks him about it now listen here
i tells him in a fatherly way you never
see no gents kissinthe rosin from jabs
or offa straight punches theyre all
right in their way dempsey hooked an
what was the matter with him

  oh he was pretty good the kid
admits serious pretty good
yeah i leads him on

  but he was jus one of the blind
hitters no science no skill now
some day ill get up against a guy like
that an ill tie him up an run him dizzy
with sheer boxin superiority

  yeah i encourages

  sure he runs on jus slip inside
them hooks or pick em off on the arms
easy now when i meet one of them
champs-

just one month after i signed the
kid up he was listed for a four-
round prelim at the atlas sporting club
i was plannin to send him up against
fireman jack jones a slow pork-and-
beaner not much better than a set-up
when jakie mccoy collars me one night
jakie had a kid on his string jus a
slow palooka so he says so we paired
em up

  the kid was awful nervous in the
locker room but when the announcer
knocked him down to the crowd he
warms up fast an gets enthusiastic
they gave him a good hand an that
seems to put steam in him ill admit
he looked pretty under them pale purple
lights with his short black trunks an
that body cut like a clean wedge

  battlin beppo against babe luke i
take a shot at this luke guy of jakies
an smell a rat if that so-called green
palooka aint seen the inside of a hun-
dred rings i dont know the difference
between a one-two to the body an a
bottle of liniment besides jakies
lookin too pleased over in his corner

  well i dont worry much my boy
looks good is good an acts good i
battlin beppo



shoot a few last words in his ear before
they give em the gong box him the
first two then step in an catch him
cornin dont hurry an keep your chin
in take your time if you go down

  sure he comes back ill jus play
with him

  well as i was sayin battlin beppo
looks great in the ring that is while
he was there they meet in the center
an jus feel around for a minute this
luke guys a hard-lookin sinner an he
carries his right cocked low his lefts
slow-too slow to be true thats how
i figure

  still i aint sweatin none my boys
prancin around easy an stickin that
jab in plenty with every once an a
while a hook his big white shoulders
gleam an hes carryin his blond head
confident theres an openin an he
digs a straight left to the tummy the
old trick though he dont get close
enough there wasnt enough on that
one to shake a rabbit

  but this luke baby drops his guard
an wraps his mitts around his groin
below the belt his head drops an he
groans something that sounds like
foul right thens where battlin
beppo lives up to his rep-or mybe
lays the foundation stone for it

  he drops his hands an sticks out his
head dumblike he half turns to me
not knowing what to do any one
could see that luke gent wasnt hurt
none any one but mister battlin
beppo he turns back jus in time

  yeah jus in time to stop a round-
house right that started from the floor
a left comes off the shoelaces fter it
an the massacre is complete battlin
beppo hits the floor in a very peaceful
position an jakie mccoy trots
around to collect that friendly little
ten we lays on the bout

  down in the locker room i tells bep-
po all about it from beginnin to finish
he dont do nothin he wasnt even
mad

  well he says when i finish the
story hard luck but that wasnt a im-

portant fight anyway an a champ
would never pull that stuff

  let em pull another like that on
you i snaps back mad an youll
never get far enough to find what a
champ does do

if risin above discouragement makes
a great scrapper this beppo gent
would a been john l sullivan jack
johnson an mister dempsey rolled in
one what i didnt tell that kid durin
the next week about how bum he was
wasnt worth mentionin i went on
the warpath bad i had iron jaw work-
in on him an what he didnt finish in
the mornin session he completes in the
afternoon go he showed every dirty
trick of the game to the kid by pullin
it on him an he unlimbered the heavy
artillery right more times than he ever
had in his life then i give the kid
a two-day layoff an match him with
gashouse gans

  this gashouse gent is the steppin
stone for every pug in town pie aint
got nothin but a glass jaw an some
flashv-lookin stunts like bouncin off
the ropes well battlin beppo takes
him by decision an the fans were
yellin for rain checks after it was over
every round but the sixth the kid had
him on the edge of a knockout an
hangin on for life but he dont put
over the k o in the sixth gashouse
is so surprised at still bein there he
steps in an swings an almost hangs one
on the kid

  if i wasnt so soft-hearted id a
dropped this beppo gent right then an
there without ever givin him his car-
tare downtown still if looks meant
anything he had the makings of a good
fighter i got him in a corner an asks
what was the matter

  well higgins it was this way he
says i could a dropped him-easy
but i wanted to show the boys i could
go the route

  mister can you beat that one any-
way gettin desperate i signs him on
with one joe flynn a tough wild-


fight stories

swingin bird who always carries the
fight i figures maybe a tough match
will rouse beppo into doin something
an i gets the kid primed for action an
tells him to step it from the first bell

  he does fine even surprises me
hes steppin in pretty an shootin them
punches across snappy iron jaws
taught him a fast cross an he gets it
over twice in the first the seconds
the same way he bores right in
feintin an openin an sockin hes
lettin flynn hit wild an steppin around
him he goes out smilin for the third
an bowin to the crowd an starts
boxin i leap up an yell for him to
get out an fight he does

  then flynn closes his eyes an shoots
one it catches the kid on the button
an i can see his knees sag still i
wasnt scared he could clinch an
hang on till hes out of it does he
no that brainless one-track-minded
palooka keeps on walkin in an hittin

  the rest dont need to be told flynn
sees hes groggy an his punches weak
he leaves himself wide open uncoils a
haymaker from his heel well after
the ref finishes countin up to ten an
im holdin the smellin salts under this
kids nose an thinkin what a waste of
time it is he opens his eyes an starts
to explain

  -an you told me to carry it to
him he ends up

  yeah an i ought to tell you to jump
off brooklyn bridge listen what
do you think a guy like tunney would
do in there cover up you half-wit
cover up plenty

  oh tunney he yawns gettin into
his bathrobe well now higgins he
aint so good he-

chapter iii
easy mark

i dont know whether i got a soft
spot some place in my head or
maybe im jus plain stubborn an hate

to leave go of anything anyway i
kept battlin beppo on an in the
gym he looked like a champ speed
punch an confidence yeah confi-
dence he always had an alibi he
was too dumb to know it

  one day he comes up to me readin
the account of last nights bout at the
garden look here higgins he
chirps up them two babies last night
pulls down one quarter of the gate re-
ceipts apiece an it was a hundred-
thousand-dollar house twenty-five
thousand smackers gee

  yeah i counters an what does
that mean to you

  oh he says some day ill be
pullin a good house down there

  well i puts him against lefty lo-
gardo up at the weston a c headin
the bill he takes the decision with a
knockout starin him in the face i
throws tough old gene parker in the
ring with him over in newark battlin
beppo turns in a first round thatd done
credit to the manassa mauler-himself
in the second he catches gene in his
own corner an shoots three hard lefts
to the head with a right cross he
steps back against the ropes to shoot
the k o an parker hunches over an
beckons to him with his glove

  come out an fight he squawks
an has the kid fooled for the rest of
the fight

  beppo meets georgia lush an tom
dominick an one-round hooker in
short order an its the same story
gents hes got these boys licked an
he never come out with better than a
decision some bonehead play every
time i was ready to throw up my
hands

  if the kid wasnt such a likeable
fella i dont think id a kept him on
easy goin an good-natured you
couldnt help warmin up to him he
tried hard too wasnt a man in my
string that took his work as seriously
an he never breaks trainin but it got
so that every time i sees that tow head
under the lights an the crowd yellin
battlin beppo



i prepares for the worst that boy was
bad news from the first gong-for me

  right about when i was gettin total-
ly discouraged jimmy doheny comes
down from chi to eliminate the only
other real challenger for the heavy title
in the field i handled jimmy when he
fought in the welter division an he
always comes over to clancys to see me
when hes in town well he drops in
an  ask him to cock an eye on this
battlin beppo the kids workin out
with the shocker

  doheny watches him for about five
minutes an dont say nothin then
he turns around to me serious
harry he tells me if im ever
champ ill make no bones about it i
dodge that baby hes got the goods
from the heels up where you been
hidin him

  i aint i avers then i tells him
the sad tale

  well lighthead he breaks in
theres only so many dumb ones he
can pull he looks like a sure money
nag to me

  mister that puts some hope back in
my system i keep on workin with
the kid an prayin then a piece of
luck drops like a bombshell into the
camp big les brown pacific coast
heavy is in town an lookin for action
before he takes on the latest south
american hope none of the boys
wants to step it with him because this
brown maulers got a rep for damagin
a gent i runs right down to his man-
ager an dickers till i get a bout for
battlin beppo

  after what jimmy doheny tells me
i know im right the kids got the
goods if he can only bring em out
for two weeks i works on gettin beppo
fightin mad i cook up a couple of rough
stories about what this les brown
thinks of the kid but it dont do no
good he jus smiles that slow grin

the night of the fight comes

 got the kid all primed up on
what this fight means maybe a shot

among the real heavies maybe a
chance at the title anything to make
him fight jus before we start for the
ring i have a note sent in supposed to
be from les brown that note aint
very sweet beppo reads it an looks
up sort of puzzled i called him about
everything in the book in a few lines
in that note

  maybe he chuckles this fellas
tryin to scare me but he wasnt even
sore

  i was lookin for the worst after that
but the kid opens my eyes for four of
the fastest toughest rounds i ever hope
to see big les brown was out to get
it over with as quick as possible he
was big an fast an crafty he shot
over a couple of swings in the first min-
ute with finish written all over em
did they bother beppo not one bit
hes fightin

  mister i almost lost my tonsils them
first four rounds the kid had every-
thing an he was usin it even the
newspaper men were hurrahin an
scribblin oft copy fast he was step-
pin it like a champ the kid carried
the battle right through the first i fig-
ured he was all shot but it was brown
what was gaspin after it was over

  the second canto was battlin beppos
easy he chopped brown back an
forth an laced his body till it was pink
if hed only got fightin mad in there
he could have finished it right then an
there but all the time while he was
fightin good he seems to lack that little
spark you know-the thing that sent
ruby fitz in with that double shift the
thing jim jeffries used to pull outa the
bag to drop his man the thing dempsey
used to uncork in the famous fourth

  the third was great beppo had the
boy from the coast lookin like a big
sandbag an breakin ground till he was
dizzy the kid shot in a barrage of
jabs and hooks that would a run a
champ ragged then les brown takes
a grip an slides under a hook a short
hard jolt to beppos midriff he for-
gets all about the hook from then on


fight stories

even at that hes crossin brown with
pretty rights an stickin that snaky left
in his eye browns viewin the world
from one side an his torso looks like
its been painted red

  before the fourth i tells the kid to
uncork the hooks again he looks
around at me shakin his head

  naw higgins youre all wrong
theyre no good jus because that pa-
looka dempsey had some luck with em
that pork-an-beaner- an the gong
rings

  i didnt get over that crack until the
kid wades in an rattles two rights over
browns heart the house is screamin
for a knockout as they tie up in a clinch
they clinch again-an again im
howlin to the kid to stand free
an hit they lock again an the kid
dont seem in any great hurry to
break

  well the story comes out after its
over it was this way so beppo tells
me in them clinches brown hands
him a sweet sob story his little wife
is down at the ringside he dont want
her to see him knocked out jus hold
oft till this round is over then hell
have her sent out do t need to tell
you that big hick fell for it

  the way he began pullin his punches
was a crime he dont rush brown
hard now an he has him twice on the
ropes an lets him away im tearin
my hair an wonderin whats wrong
ten seconds to go  see browns glove
come up an wave to some one down at
the ringside

  his wife the kid figured he stole
jus a glance brown was set he took
jus one shot with that dynamite left
curtains battlin beppo never saw
mister browns wife an les was grin-
nin in the center of the ring with his
hand up when the kid wakes

  yeah he fooled me the kid ad-
mits after the battle with that slow
grin but tunney wont

  no i groans

  no he assents that ham i
mixed it with tonight aint any good

he pulled a nifty now them guys at
the top aint much better-

      chapter iv
      the frame-up

they say a rollin stone gathers no
moss but i always figured that the
gent that wrote that nifty must a lived
in a country where grass didnt grow on
a hillside anyway along about that
time the pickings were gettin pretty
thin in the big burg all the boys in my
stable had strutted their stuff in every
fight club around an they couldnt draw
no more laughs from the fans

  iron jaw was gettin so he jus stood
an swung the shocker was hittin
the cabarets hard an i figures maybe a
change of scene will help him as for
battlin beppo the fight boys had his
number they didnt want to see him
any more if they had to pay so i let
the other has-beens out an hit the road
with these three

  first stop was fhillv an we was
swingin west from there the kid
steps ten with pete dono an gets a draw
after havin the fight tied up in the fifth
from then on he elects to slug with this
baby hippo outweighin him forty
pounds it didnt do him no good in
buffalo he meets the local favorite an
tries to jab his way to victory against a
guv who specialized in imitatin a
shadow on the train out of buffalo
he explains this

  sure higgins he broke out in the
smoker i cant help wantin to jab
i got a good one pretty an fast aint
she juslike a champion yeah when
it comes to the jab its me an tunneym

  yeah i submits lightin a cigar

  hed be good if he was a little
faster the kid admits

  in a backwoods town called carlton
in the sticks of illinois i tries a new
one i figures if i could get the kid
blind mad hed be too crazy to make
battlin beppo



any bonehead plays for the last six
months i been tryin to get him seein
red an it aint worked hes too good-
natured but at carlton i digs up some
of the local applejack

  i knew the kid would raise a howl
about drinkin so i feed jus enough to
him before the bout callin it iron
tonic it hits him plenty an hes even
rollin a bad eye at me when we starts
for the ring

  it works fine he lays the other boy
out with a one-two an looks around for
more worlds to conquer his glazed
eyes light on the ref an he uncorks a
hook with morgue tagged all over it
the ref forgets to duck an we leaves
that burg with our coat-tails stiff in the
wind

  from then on its a losin game i
work everything i can think of or ever
heard of on the kid nothin takes
hes good-natured an hes dumb an
thats enough in chi i tell him to make
a runnin fight of it with slug herberts
a south side pug the kid backpedals
for eight innings shootin a straight
right an hookin heavy with his left
hes got the guy dizzy an fought out
in the seventh a couple of stiff kidney
punches sets the stage for the fade-out
in the eighth an battlin beppo still
breaks ground i give up

  in detroit i dont sign him on with
anybody he sits on the sidelines an
tells me how the war should have been
run when its over

  now if iron jaw had let that baby
carry the fight in the seventh hed a
had something left for the last he con-
fides in me innocent-like the champs
all do that

  sure i says iron jaws won
more scraps than you lost i adds

pion he comes back blue eyes serious

slug herberts i took on in chi that
fella was lousy you could hit him witli
anything he was wide open an-

  well i breaks in why didnt you

  he shrugs his big shoulders why
should i take a chance against that punk
pug i got everything to lose an noth-
in to gain

  that had me stopped we blew intot
st louis an met a load of hard-luck
rain an a bad house iron jaw slips
under the ropes an breaks a leg the
shocker meets up with a couple of molls
he knew in new york an goes out on
one party he never comes back from
there i was harry higgins the slick-
est fight manager in the game with a
no-good hit-an-miss pug on my hands

  well i signs battlin beppo on for a
fifteen-round slug-fest with some black-
smith down in a burg people forgot
we blew in an the fight blew up the
local peanut promotors got cold feet
me an the battler climbed onto a train
an got run off two stations up the line
because we had no more tare im get-
tin a little stiff in the limbs an aint got
no desire to ride the rails i takes a look
at the kid an hes grinnin

  why i asks

  some day he chuckles ill get a
big kick outa rememberin this-when
im at the top of the pile

  right then an there i could have
socked that bimbo when i comes to
check back it seems like all my hard
luck began when i signed on the kid
an he hasnt helped any well we
dogs it down the main street of this
joint an pull in at the local hotel our
baggage gets us in but the dinin room
is separate an run on a cash basis looks
like we dont eat an im plannin work-
in the battler out as a farm hand over
my last cigaret

right then is where ol lady luck
takes a tumble an unbends im
tryin to prolong the last drag as much
as i can when a smooth quiet voice
right above me breaks in

  got a match lighthead

  i looks up an its spud jordan spud

on me over in newark but he looked

head he inquires without excitement
i tell him got a fighter with you eh 
he drawls that aint bad news bat-
tlin beppo that big boloney you had
at the atlas club well he looked

  spud eases himself into a chair an
tilts his panama back on his head wrhen
spud does that theres something in the
air i waits

  i got a hunch lighthead he begins
you know im handlin tiger palmer
now dont you a good boy the tiger
a good boy some day lighthead he
draws on you might sign up with a
boy like the tiger if you keep your
eyes closed long enough

  he chuckles a while over his humor
which i dont appreciate very much if
spud hadnt v picked up one of my
has-beens an made a welter threat outa
him with a streak of luck hed still be
snipin bills for the atlas club today
well he goes on gettin confident now
as he moves closer

  heres the dope lighthead the
tigers up a tree som i its this way

  jus at that moment the battler
ambles up makin a bout higgins
he grins put the bee on em for cash
in advance an the champ aint too
good with that sweet one he ambles
on that bird really figured hed be
champ some day

  spud laughs that one off an goes on
the tigers been chasm reilly the
coast champ all over the country for a
bout we got a promoter in chi whos
ready to back the brawl but the champ
wont sign the tigers taken them all
out around frisco but hes got to keep
fightin to keep the public hot now
lighthead follow close if i can get
one good fight with the earmarks of a
murder for the tiger-which he wins
of course-well have the champ cor-
nered heres the play

  he brings out a pair of cigars an we
lights up

  the battler aint no good-but hes
flashy i saw him one night when he
looked like a second edition of jim cor-
bett himself o k now    we
swing him in with the tiger for a bout
right in this dump give out the news
that its a grudge fight an then lay low
about the pedigree of your man the
mystery stuff the newsboys out here
dont know the battler from king tut
well bake up a pedigree for him thatll
make john l look like a flop   
fifteen rounds to a finish-by knock-
out the tiger    get that   
theyll fall hard for it the tiger
forces the champs hand an youre in a
thousand apiece like it

  like it did i i never even dick-
ered i grabs spuds mit an lets by-
gones be bygones - after gettin five
hundred in advance then i rounds up
the battler an steers him into the dinin
room as we stow away the chow i
begins to give him the dope

  i got you a fight i opens up

  good harry good he grins
that slow easy grin that reminds me how
hopeless he is one of these small
town palookas eh i starts in to tell
him the rest but hes got more to say
dont worry i trust you you know
he gets confidential as his stomach
fills you done right by me harry
dont think i dont know it an
when i begin to crash the big money
harry youre goin to be right with
me

  to tell the truth that dont give me
any vision of riches now big boy
i begin again about this scrap i feel
im goin to have a hard time gettin
him to sign for a fixed go but i aim to
convince him the guy youre meetin
is-

  thats all right harry he assures
me anything you say i was readin
the other day about jack dempsey an
the faith he usta have in kearns me
im the same way about you an he
pulls that big grin again that makes me
battlin beppo



feel like a criminal sometimes it makes
me wonder how i could dislike a fella
like him because hes one of the squarest
blokes i ever met an easy to get along
with if he only wasnt a leather pusher

  well now i begins again as we
reach the pie this fella ti-

  an theres one thing more harry
he breaks in again i aint been doin
so good all the time that all the
time was a hot one but its been a
lot of hard luck things cant always be
breakin against me some day ill be
in the top row that guys faith in
himself made my eyes water sometimes
an theres another thing when im
signin for one of the big boys-
dont forget our share of the movie
rights  

  well mister i almost caves in on
that one this lowdown palooka worry-
in about the movie rights of a big bout
sort of like that noah gent figurin on
gettin the trans-atlantic trade i order
another helpin of that pie an jump off
again

  battler this cornin bouts a funny
one youre mixin it with-

  another thing harry he jabs tak-
in the toothpick outa his mouth any-
thing you say goes with me but when
we sign for the champ-or one of them
big bouts-make em come across i
notice as how the champ usually takes
the big end well i figure it takes two
to make a scrap his big honest eyes
fix me two an these gents like
tunney an dempsey got to have some
one to fight to make the coin so when
we hitch in call em for a fifty-fifty
break

  cornin from any one else id a
laughed right out loud an saved my
sleeve but this ham kid was so dumb
he meant it yes sir then that tips
me off an i closes up like a trap fifty-
fifty eh supposin he knows hes
ftghtin the tiger fifty-fifty eh i
thinks fast a cigar helps

  what do you know about the boy
were takin on here harry he asks

  i think faster oh jus a hick pug

 f-

i comes back snappy name of micky
morris an not much

  he sighs some day of course well
be signin with a gent like this here
tiger palmer an hit the big game he
says slowly

  micky morris this shot kid

      chapter v
      under cover

gents i dont claim ill ever die
of a attack of brainstorm but i
sure pulls some fast thinkin in that
dinin-room an i follows it up with a
pretty piece of back-pedaling next day
at sunrise i jerks battlin beppo outa
town an rents a shack in the hills for
his trainin quarters then i drew a
comfortable breath

  its this way theres the kid jus
pullin that fifty-fifty gag suppose he
should learn were takin on the tiger
right away hell be demandin fifty-
fifty an a clause in the contract callin
for the winner to face the coast champ
were lucky to get this scrap an luckier
still to draw a thousand apiece but i
never could a convinced that big inno-
cent dumb-bell of that so i decides
hell never know who were takin on

  i goes into town to dig up a cook an
to cock an eye at the mornin papers
spud sure had worked fast the local
sheet has it big tiger palmer signs far
grudge bout tiger to meet old man-
killing rival tollervxlle gets battle
banned elsewhere mister that spud
boy sure spread it thick the chi an
st louis papers has it covercd on their
sport sheets tiger in feud bout coast
challenger to meet mystery rizal
sounded great spud was clever

  well i hotfooted it back to camp
thankin my stars the battler aint read
a sport sheet since some manhattan edi-
tor panned him as the big fizz and flop
man from the wide west it got him
sore then he figured these babies were
dumb so he never bothers no more


fight stories

about them i gets back jus in time to
save the beans three newspaper men
from the local sheets were waitin for
an interview

  the battlers jus gettin dressed after
his road-work an ready to give em a
spiel i saves him the trouble yes
its true i tells em the battler meets
the tiger the battlers record well
id rather not say we felt we were
lucky catchin spud jordan an his man
an we didnt want to scare em out of
the fight yes its true they banned the
fight in several states no they couldnt
see the battler work out not for sev-
eral days anyway

  i gets rid of them gents an dashes
off to avire porky howard who was
walkin the streets in chi when we went
through hes a old-time ham-an-egg
pug on his heels but he can make the
battler step an keep up the appearances
of a real trainin camp porky arrives
on the afternoon train an over a meal
i give him the lowdown ive staked
porky moren once an he sticks by me
then he puts the kid through a few
rounds

  things were sorta quiet for the next
few days spud comes over an o ks
the layout the battler takes his trainin
as serious as ever an shapes up good
in the eyes of the local sport writin
gentry who watch him from a distance
this mystery stuff about the battlers
past has got them an the post comes out
with a yarn hintin the kids put some
guy to sleep for keeps down south an
jus slipped out of a prison term that
suits me fine spud too

  spuds a smooth talker an he lines
up some backin from the local big guns
for the fight they got a race track
grandstand an the town throws up tem-
porary seats around the green free in re-
turn for the publicity things are goin
smooth with the kid believin hes fight-
ing some hick called micky morris

   burn all the papers when im
through with em porky never opens
his chops then two newspaper gents
drop in from chi the next day they

play the bout off as some sort of secret
grudge feud thats tryin to dodge the
authorities couple of days later an-
other drops in an i spot him as jacobs
the expert dopester of the bunch he
goes home an tells how he thinks he
recognizes the battler as a gent he saw
in a bout at the weepah goldfields last
year he then presents us with a rec-
ord that sounds like wholesale murder

  everything seems to be breakin right
i dont tell spud i aint put the kid
wise that guy plays em awful safe an
might get hard about it he aint aimin
to take no chances on his man but i
dont dare let the kid in on the game
an i figure its safe anyway the bat-
tlers sure to drop the fight some place
he aint never failed yet ill send him
in with orders to back-pedal an box like
a fool that guy nor no other can buck
the fates an previous records prove
they got his name on the wrong side of
the book

  the kids talkin all the time now
about the big fights it gets under my
skin sometimes hes so serious one
day he springs this one

  porky tells me the champ aint had
a fight this year an lies puttin on
weight believe me harry youll never
catch me doin that or you notice
harry i aint on my toes so much now
none of the big boys does that in train-
in somehow that makes me mad

well things runs along so good i
cant believe im alive spud lines
up a referee from among the tigers
handlers thats good insurance against
a break the mayors tickled silly when
spud offers to let him be official an-
nouncer the local board of commerce
puts up the ring an rigs a good lightin
plant over it everythins smooth

  that is it is until the day i slip over
to the tigers camp for an hour spud
wants to fix the details porky promises
to herd off the newsmen theyre pretty
thick around there now while im
talkin with spud i happen to look over
the tiger he aint been takin his
battlin beppo



trainin seriously anyway an he looks
shabby an slow an sort of careless i
notices he misses a punch occasional an
his boys are handlin him light i dont
say nothin to spud but when i get
home i watch the kid closern ever

  mister ill admit the kid always
looked good in the gym but this out-
door stuff seems to have done some-
thing to him he admits he came from
a burg like this anyway maybe its
that home feelin anyway hes plain
mean an vicious steppin around with
the fast-movin porky that little boy
can hit some himself an i almost keels
over when i see the kid drop his guard
an let porky tear in wild

  j think this over the battler always
looked good but he looks better now
an when he moves sometimes he re-
minds you of the way a scared fish darts
in the water fast an easy also-i
see a snarl breakin out every once an
awhile that aint good if he gets
fightin mad-wherell i be he might
do anything

   always thought that anyway may-
be thats why i held on to him so long
the way those clean-cut straight limbs
snap about puts a chill in my heart
also the kids gettin bigger he seems
to have spread some an put on weight
in the barrel not fat either no that
kind of beef that ripples like coils of
burnished copper-mean an wicked

  i dont sleep well on it either but
the next day relief sails into port the
news crowd standin back of a rope i
rigged up about twenty yards from the
ring is jabberin an lookin then one
of em catches my eye an i spots him
as charley forbes the old heavy who
used to knock em galley-west at shar-
keys club i go down an give him the
glad hand stung with a bright idea

  hes coverin it for some sport sheet
in detroit i asks him how hed like to
have a real story about how the battler
felt to him he dont get me at first
i explains i mean for him to climb in
an mix it with the kid now charley
aint never quite got that fever for the

feel of a punch outa his system some
of em never do thats why they keep
coinin back till they lock em up in a
padded cell an hes one of them guys
that always keeps in training also hes
written detour on more up-an-comers
than any other leather-pusher in the
game

  he falls for the idea it dont take
no time to slip him into a pair of trunks
an introduce him to the kid we run
off the rest of the news gang an they
go at it

  three rounds an fast charleys step-
pin to knock him if he can the kid
looks good awful good then charley
paws him in the eye-shoots a couple of
rabbit punches in the clinches-cracks
him with a backhand shot he even
snarls at the kid the battler steps fast
but he dont get mad jus keeps a-grin-
nin an inovin three times he has an
openin charley leaves em a-purpose
but something seems to tie the kid up
an he cant drop him

  charley tells me the lowdown while
hes gettin back into his clothes hes
good but he lacks the knockout wallop
dont seem to have the fire no hed
never trouble a real champ

  that makes me feel good after
charley leaves i ponder it some
strange maybe its the excitement or
the tenseness of a real bout that ties him
up makes him do the wrong thing holds
him from flashin over when the times
right

  well i been workin on that problem
over a year now an i know its useless
i aim to give the kid the gate after this
bout anyway why worry

chapter vi
fightin wild

gents i dont need to tell you
about the crowd there that sat-
urday night it even surprised spud
moren five thousand with a special
train from chi all the folks from miles


fight stories

around had rode in they were set for
a big fight-ready to see their first fight
at the last minute they rigs up a thou-
sand more benches an even then when
the local palookas had messed through
the prelims they were standin all over
an even parkin their cars an buggies
back of the seats

  everything was set in the tent wed
rigged up at the end of the park the
battler was nervous an he never was
that way before i asks him whats the
matter

  them big blue eyes set on me an i
notice theyre kinda pale tonight his
hands quivers at his sides an he cant
lay still when he speaks hes husky
an hoarse

  gee harry he blurts out this is
different this seems like a real big
ffght an i got to make good tonight
thems my kind of people out there
they-

  somebody sticks their head in the tent
flap an veils good luck against the
tiger kid

  the kid looks quick at me hes sort
of strained around the jaws

  tiger - ha - ha - ha i laughs
thats a good one they got a new
name for mickey eh that was close

  well the time comes to go down it
was hot an the battlers hide glistens
like oil when he climbs into the ring
standin there under the lights he gets
a big hand from the crowd his tow-
head waves an bobs an suddenly the
enthusiasm seems to run away with him

  mitts above his head shakin hands
with em he yells out tiger palmer
next then the champ it brought an-
othercheer an a laugh the kid didnt
know the joke

  but it brought a groan from me hon-
est that kid was so serious an dumb
standin there the poor pug with that
crazy dream of bein a champ mister
do worms ever get to be alligators an-
swer me that

  the tiger comes in then hard-faced
an arrogant you know he steps over
to the kid an shakes hands like he was

bad to touch then he goes around
bobbin to the crowd the mayor does
his stuff an when he points to the
tigers corner mister i began talkin
fast in the kids ear so he wouldnt get
the name

  -an in this comer battlin beppo
the terror of the pacific coast one
hundred an ninety-four pounds

  go careful kid this guy aint no
set-up hes three kinds of wildcat in
close back-pedal plenty an stay away
from him dont risk a shot keep
backin an sparrin dont forget youre
a boxer

  all right harry honest man that
made me feel bad that kid was so
trustin

  bang the gong

  there they go the battler slips out
easy an starts snakin that left right off
the tiger begins stalkin him feints him
open an slides his glove high on his
head it sounded like a crownin wal-
lop an the crowd went mad but the
tiger was playin his game twice more
he connects in the midriff but light all
of em pulled the kid chops his face

  mister the battler was beautiful that
round like a big oiled piston sleek an
slippery movin fast an easy he was
all bronze from the sun an under them
yellow lights i begins to notice the
shoulder muscles when he moves they
flow like soft steel slippin under a veil
he crosses a hard right to the tigers
ear as he comes in the tiger grunts
an frowns that was a heavy shot

  the rounds over the kid comes
back light an fine i was almost wish-
in he was fightin a real fight that night
id a sent him in hard he grins up at
me an says the other guys good but
hittin light i have to turn my face
away them blue eyes of his   

there goes the buzzer ten sec-
onds more hold him off back
water spar kid thats what i told
him then he went in believin me an
playin the tiger pretty round they
go workin like a pair of swordsmen
battlin beppo



thats it swords the tiger leaps an
throws a couple of punches figurin hes
safe because its fixed anyway hes
open wide

  the battler slides under bendin
straightenin an when he comes up
he cuts loose with a pretty double hook
into the tigers ribs then he breaks
ground again smilin at the tiger hes
some sore they were heavy too he
tries to work in to tell the kid to lay
off the kid takin my advice wont
let him get close

  the tiger keeps cornin the battler
backin he dont lead hard an hardly
counters an the tiger gets rash he
plunges once-an misses he plunges
again an the kid aint there the
tiger hits the ropes the kids waitin
for him three times to the heart hard
an straight nasty makes you think of
a snake whippin in

  the tiger covers up quick an stalls
the battler seems to be flat-footed an
waitin sudden-like that left whips
out a cuts opened over the tigers
eye the rounds over

  the kid comes in confident feelin
great he tells me wants to tear in an
eat the tiger up careful i warns stay
away keep him cornin gee im ner-
vous spuds givin me the sign from
his corner thumbs down to make the
kid lay off im tryin to think of some-
thing to tell him when the gong clangs

  the tigers still got the red welt over
his heart as he walks out an the kid
fools him again instead of cornin
cautious an waitin for the tiger to
lead he slips one into the tigers face
the tiger grunts an covers another
an another i screams at the battler
an he backs off the tiger tries to cor-
ner him but its like cornerin smoke no
chance the kids footwork is perfect

  ever- minute i was regrettin the deal
id gone through the boy was pretty
tonight still hed always looked good
around the ring they go the tiger un-
hooks one from the floor an throws it a
mile wide it looks great to the crowd
an he knows the kid wont cut him

down but the kid does three chop-
pin hooks to the sore eye a smash
straight on the button the crowds
wild crazy yellin

  the tiger drops into a clinch he
holds the kid an i can see hes talkin
in his ear i see the kids tow head
gleamin in the light snap back his
mugs twisted in anger an he breaks
throwin the tiger halfway across the
ring

  gents from then on shes a fight
the prize palooka of the second-third
rate fight clubs against the outstandin
fighter of the pacific coast an mister
what a battle i never see the kid that
way before he steps in an hes plenty
close when he lets go with a pair of
drives to shake a gunboat they hit an
sink when they connect he steps back
leadin the maddened tiger to step in
an when he does   

  bam you could hear splittin flesh
then flesh an bone the tiger went
down in a heap he rolled an writhed
an the kid was against the ropes-ready
to swoop out the ref the guy from
the tigers camp takes about five sec-
onds gettin over to the man before he
starts the count

  one-two-three-get up tiger-
four-r-r-hurry tige-f-f-five-come
out of it tiger -six-s-s-seven-are
you gettin up tige-come on tige
-e-e-e-e-ight-come on tige   

  spud saved the day sneakin around
the corner of the ring he jerks the bell
string with twenty seconds to go they
drag the tiger to his corner the
crowds tearin the place apart i cant
hardly make myself heard in the kids
ear an i dont know what to say gee
how  want to send him in to win i
mumble something about back-pedalin
but i can see he aint listenin

  i take a quick look at him an his eyes
are like little splinters of ice-like cold
blue steel his lips is two white lines
across his teeth his fine clean-cut head
is still an tense i read the signs crazy-
mad i cant figure it back-pedal
kid  r ac


fight stories

  spud jordan purple-faced rips me
away double crossin eh dirty
work you lousy-

  i cuts him short an begins explainin
the rest period is already ten seconds
over time theyre bracin tiger fast in
his corner i tell spud the truth there
aint nothin else to do porky leaps
down an backs me up spud sees its
true because he knows the kid never
fought like that he shakes me around
an bawls me out for a dumb-bell

under you gotta he yells shakin a
fist in my face

  im desperate i slosh enough of
water over the kid to drown him chillin
them muscles it dont seem right but
i cant double-cross spud its a acci-
dent the battler fightin like this hes
against a near champ an hes showin
him up lickin him

at last the gong goes jus as the
mob gets suspicious theyre out
the tiger ready now an set to fight--
real they clash in the dead center of
the ring a writhin sweepin turmoil of
bronze arms an the smack-smack of
leather an its the tiger who reels
back his heads rollin

  an the kid dont play his part no
missteps no errors now no he feints
three times like a veteran then he
whips a trio of hooks to the tigers
tummy hard ones that land with a cruel
smack he steps back an the tiger
lunges to clinch he misses an falls
the battler surprises me again hes
in an hurls a brace of swats to the
tigers face the tiger hits the canvas
an dont move

  spud saves the day again jumpin
into the ring an bawlin foul
foul

  the ref cant do nothin no long
countd save the tiger now the whole
place is in a frenzy the dins awful
it takes a couple of minutes before the
tigers managers out of the ring an
theyre bringin the tiger around the
ret rules for the to continue

  spuds at my side shoutin in my ear
ill never get the rest of that two grand
suddenly i dont care my kids fight-
in fightin like he never fought before
the tigers roused now his big torso
twists an snakes around as he works in
the kid waits an suddenly breaks
ground again

  the tiger leaps for him an catches
him jus as the battlers glidin off the
ropes they clinch its awful red-
stained gloves thuddin like dull guns
two lean tan bodies writhin under that
canopy of light a screamin insane
crowd

  they both reel back an the kids
face is battered and bleedin the tiger
lurches in the kid beats him to it
hes coinin in faster like a knife findin
a hole

  both his mitts drop the tiger swings
for his head the kid takes it is he
goin nuts the tiger recoils an lets
fly again the kid takes it the tiger
laughs silent an draws back for the
knockout then that mad kid comes to
life

  those two mitts shoot up like two
pistons they find the tigers face
hard something snaps like bone the
tiger wilts on his feet the kid hits
again-and again-and again the tiger
swings into a clinch cuttin loose a low
one

  did that kid cover up an tie up those
arms naw im yellin like a maniac
the kids hittin with him short jar-
rin man-breakin jolts like a demp-
sey the tiger drops back stiff in
agony

  the battler poises on his toes meas-
ures him with the left smack she
goes in that right five times  an
one awful thunderbolt outa the left
the tigers down flat the noise rolls
like a poundin ocean on your ears the
tiger never quivers

spud nails the bell again-with thirty
seconds to go the fans shout murder
the rest period is extended to two min-
utes the tigers still a limp stained
a his chair the mayor who was
battlin beppo



announcin leaps in an puts battlin
beppos right duke in the air then
there was noise

well gents out in the tent i kept
smacking the battler on the back
an askin him how come hes grinnin
sheepish again with that slow smile an
his blue eyes is as dumb as ever how
come i was demandin

  well he says slow-like the big
palooka grabs a-hold of me in the third
an tells me to lay off the heavy stuff-
the fights fixed gee harry i cant
stand anybody accusin me of fixin a

fight-of fightin crooked he smiles
again i got mad

  i jus stands there lookin too struck
to open my mug a half-dozen news-
paper guys rush in collarin the kid
before i could get between em

  the kid dont say nothin well
they cries what do y think of tiger
palmer

like when he pulls that slow grin hes
jus like dempsey an tunney an them
other palookas i could take em now
this guy i mixes with tonight-micky
morris-theres a real scrapper 

the end

honest tom the blacksmith

out of a rather colorless series of so-called eliminations tom heeney has
emerged to be decorated with the crown of logical contendership and in
spite of the booming razzberries of many boxing fans it must be said that heeneys
selection was the only just one to make its true that heeney didnt display any
knockout punch its also true that he isnt blooming with that elusive box-office
it called color but he is willing to fight and he fights hard-which is more
than can be said of some of the other logicals

  heeney stepped in with all of em his record against paulino the basque
axe-expert is better than it reads in the records he earned just decisions against
delaney and risko and sharkey by sheer aggressiveness and willingness to mix it
he didnt wipe up the canvas with them-but he won

  the experts of course concede him little chance against mr tunney they
say his aggressive style is built for gene that tunney will slaughter any one who
forever comes piling in and swinging free they also say that he hasnt punch
enough to hurt the champion when he connects-if any

  tunney figures to outbox heeney-but so did sharkey and it would be well to
recall that the same people who scoff at heeney against the champion were equally
scoffish when joseph eugene tunney donned the cesti for the first time against
dempsey in the rain at philadelphia

  tom heeney is making no boasts in his quiet way he is going about his training
with one idea in mind ill make him-and the folks who see it-know hes been
in a fight

  the idea is typical of heeney and when honest tom sets out to let a fellow
know hes been in a scrap he is apt to do it at least hell be in there trying
  referees decision

by arthur j burks

he had a leathernecks fighting heart and a wallop like dynamite but
beyond the ropes was terror that seared his soul

the lightweight championship of
the fleet was at stake lieutenant
gillis marine corps realized this
he hadnt wanted to be the third man in
the ring but he had been detailed be-
cause some wise jazzbo who had known
him in the old days had told the old
man he was good at it

  scarcely conscious of what he was
saying he spoke to the two brown pan-
thers in the center of the ring one
was frederico calles present holder of
the title a filipino the other was
young dave burdett the challenger
whose skin was like that of a baby hair
combed back like that of a drugstore
cowboy

  hit with one arm free no holding
rabbit punch barred break when i
tell you to

  neither paid gillis much heed appar-
ently though gillis wondered if bur-
dett remembered it had been five years
before-bum job that time burdett
had gone to the hospital with three bro-
ken ribs because gillis hadnt stopped


the fight in time but he didnt seem to
remember

  the fighters turned away going to
their corners just as they turned bur
dett snarled at the officer over his
shoulder

  hope youre not as entirely rotten
as the last time i saw you doing your
stuff gillis

  then the bell started the fight but
burdett had planted the old seed again
only gillis knew how far back beyond
that other fight his memory went to con-
found him back to long before marine
corps days when gillis had been a ware-
house man two-fisted square-jawed the
born fighter-and one of the worlds
most sensitive men hed mixed it with
a lot of chaps in his time until that
fatal evening when an amateur after
all he was inveigled into a battle with
a professional mauler

  just a kid then a kid who was known
by his first name to every man who saw
the scrap they knew him for a comer
he wasnt trained for this fight hadat
referees decision



expected it last-minute substitution
be had been for a scrapper who had
suddenly caught cold some folks said
in the feet anyway gillis had gone in

  and the professional fighter grin-
ning a grin that glistened with gold his
broad nostrils working like pulses
knocked him out in the first round but
he didnt let gillis drop he kept him
on his feet fooled the crowd through-
out and battered and mauled him for
five additional rounds his hands had
been too heavy to lift he couldnt fight
back the pro didnt hurt him he
was too numb but his ears caught the
shouts of the crowd

  yellow yellow stand up and
fight him gillis dont lay down like a
whipped cur

  they never knew for gillis never told
them that he had been knocked out in
the first and then had been scientifically
carried through five rounds of ungodly
drubbing

  and since that day he had never
fought in the ring the blasted crowds
did it wasnt yellow either he told
himself it was the crowds and their
yelling their heartlessness hed re-
fused to scrap a champion in quantico
whither his record had followed him
and because he gave no reason his
friends said he was yellow even the
man he had been asked to fight thought
so he taunted giilis with fear and
gillis took him out in the woods with
only a few friends looking on and gave
him a trouncing he would never forget

  watch this baby gillis hes hit-
ting low

  that was burdett snarling as usual
complaining as usual hard egg bur-
dett always ready to take three to
land one and one was usually enough
but in the filipino he was up against
class callcs was like a jungle cat un-
smiling shooting in damaging blows
from every angle

  the crowd was at it again

  whered you get that referee yank
em apart dont let em stall

  yank em apart he did how he

dreaded the end of the fight referees
decision and folks who knew said he
hadnt given a right decision in ten
years of taking third place in the ring
he knew better himself the old man
had called him in

  burdett is our pride gillis he had
said fancy the boys have got up a
lot of dough on him

   always call em the way i see em
sir gillis had said whether the deci-
sion pleases the crowd the fighters or
the newspapermen

  that of course is what is expected
of you

and now they were at it calles the
champion burdett the challenger
calles was all over the ring and all over
burdett but burdett was a cagy
scrapper he sank his fist into the
stomach of the filipino and the filipino
went back on his heels hands dropping
to his stomach burdett flew at him
and was knocked flat on his back by a
couple which came so fast even gillis
almost missed em

  burdett bounced up without a count
and blood dripped from his lips to dye
his chin he punched the filipino off
balance shot a right cross to the jaw
calles dropped rolled halfway across
the ring staggered to his feet as gillis
followed him plunged against the ropes
whirled facing burdett who his face
set in a mask of determination pre-
pared for the finishing blow

  off the ropes bounced calles tearing
at burdett like a wildcat across the
ring he drove him into the ropes rock-
ing his head with rights and lefts not
deigning to protect himself keeping
burdett so busy burdett couldnt fight
back he rocked his head from side to
side lowered his own head and fairlv
lifted burdett to his toes with savage
uppercuts to the short-ribs burdett
went through the ropes doubled up like
a jack-knife hanging by his knees
calles came back and burdett was
through inside the ring again before
gillis could count


fight stories

  make em fight make em fight
burdett burdett

  this was a burdett crowd burdett
was away behind hed been out-
smarted by the older more skilful fili-
pino but gillis knew the crowd didnt
think so burdett had apparently
smothered the filipino in a flurry of
blows time after time but gillis had
seen that every one of em landed on a
protecting glove or elbow or missed en-
tirely by almost nothing burdett ap-
parently landed two for one on the fili-
pino yet calles was ahead on points
gillis knew it

  but if he gave the decision to bur-
dett it would be wrong if he gave it
to calles the crowd would go wild al-
ways the crowd the crowd had no
mercy he knew crowds every man
in it apparently knew more about fight-
ing than the referee and theyd got
his name from the printed program

  get busy gillis cant you see
calles is hitting low part em you
saphead

  so easy to call names when a fellow
couldnt tell who was calling them

  probably not one of those yelling ma-
niacs out there had ever officiated as
third man in a ring or done battle with
the gloves either crowds were merci-
less through the yelling now of those
who thought he wasnt doing his stuff
came from down the dim corridors of
memory the voice of another crowd that
shouted at him

  stand up and fight him gillis
youre yellow yellow

  and the other crowd hadnt been able
to see that he was out his arms like
lead that he didnt drop simply because
the professional mauler wouldnt let
him

  and the same kind of crowd yelling
now

  watch the filipino gillis hes
hitting low get on the job you
dumbbell

  mad with bloodlust the crowd was
fighting the fight themselves vicariously
as crowds did fickle without mercy

flicking in the raw those sensitive ones
who happened to be in the limelight-
that light which from above the arena
showered a circle of silver light upon the
glistening blood-spattered torsos of
calles and burdett

  it was the fourth round calles and
burdett stood toe to toe in the center
of the ring going at it hammer and
tongs their arms moved so rapidly
one could scarcely see them certainly
none beyond the newspapermen at ring-
side could check up on those blows

  but gillis-gillis saw them all and
noted that calles landed two where bur-
dett landed one burdett made more
noise as his gloves slapped home hit
oftener was more spectacular but as
always his blows were practically harm-
less because the gloves elbows and
shoulders of calles flicked them aside

  calles heard the shouting of the
crowd and grinned slightly at gillis

  get him burdett knock the brown
boy for a loop sock him batter
him down hes only a cheese cham-
pion 

  gillis understood the grin of calles
calles knew crowds and calles knew
that burdett was a whipped fighter so
did gillis so did burdett himself
but the crowd did not know bur-
detts eyes were glassy his knees trem-
bling but he had guts lots of em
and he stood toe to toe with calles ex-
changing damaging blows a crowd-
pleaser that was it a crowd-pleaser
yet burdett was whipped with two
rounds yet to go

  calles knew it burdett knew it gil-
lis knew it and the newspapermen knew
it but the newspapermen had one ad-
vantage over a referee the referee had
to decide after the last bell who had won
while the newspapermen could discover
the reaction of the crowd to the decision
-and write stories that would please
the greatest number

the sixth and last round both
men came from their corners ap-
parently as fresh as when the fight had
referees decision



started they touched gloves in the
center of the ring darted apart then
calles bored in he went in like a bat-
tering ram burdett swung at him
calles blocked the blow with his glove
he slipped in a small wet place dropped
to his knees and burdett was all over
him an accident nothing more

  but the crowd yelled for burdett to
the crowd it had been a knockdown and
burdett was miles ahead

  finish him burdett finish him
youve got him youve got him

  then they wrere at it again circling
feinting but feinting little as each bat-
tler goaded himself to the utmost to
make a showing in the last round to do
his best to influence crowd and referee
to his standard calles was covered
with blood but most of it came from
the nose of burdett who had hung on
time after time until gillis had pulled
him away and warned him for holding
calles looked like a beefsteak but it was
burdetts blood

  the crowd didnt know that

  their breath coming in agonized
gasps the fighters stood toe to toe at the
bell heads down all science flung to the
winds striving for that last-minute
knockout battering battering slugging
the crowd was on its feet yelling like
mad-

  clang

  without a moment of hesitation
gillis crossed to calles and held up his
hand burdett was tight behind the
referee

  couldnt give a chap a break gillis
could you  he snarled just as rot-
ten as always

  burdett strode to calles shook his
hand and gillis heard him snarl
youre a dirty fighter calles you-
calles only grinned then flung aside
the hand of burdett

  to the crowd this was an indication
of burdetts wonderful sportsmanship
the crowd went wild unobtrusively
several privates wearing sidearms
slipped into the ring it was an ugly
crowd gillis had given a rotten deci-

sion his face was white as he strode
to the reporters bench

  how do you chaps stand he asked
a veteran of typewriter and prize-
fights replied

  i agree with you all the way through
kid and ill write her up that way
but he didnt next morning his
paper carried a story which bitterly be-
rated gillis called him a blind referee
and gave four rounds to burdett with
the other two even

  the old man sent for gillis

  rotten decision gillis he said
coldly were you blind last night
the men lost thousands of dollars on
your decision

  it was the correct one sir replied
gillis id give the same decision
again in like circumstances rematch
those two for ten rounds and calles
will knock burdett out

  if they are rematched gillis re-
plied the old man well have a man
in the ring who knows something about
the game

  but when the rematch came every-
body had forgotten about gillis deci-
sion and not one newspaper mentioned
it though calles furiously intent upon
proving that the newspapers had been
wrong before knocked burdett out in
the sixth round

  but everybody had forgotten except
gillis who now knew what he should
have known all along he was yellow
in a way he feared no man would
fight any one his weight-outside the
ring-but he couldnt stand the merci-
less ranting of a crowd

the test came two years later in
shanghai gillis went over with
the fourth regiment of marines and
went through the hectic early days of the
trouble around shanghai everybody
except the close followers of the fight
game had forgotten the past perform-
ances of gillis in the ring but gillis
didnt forget he never would the
yells of the crowds rang in his ears
always


fight stories

  somewhere some time somehow he
promised himself he would conquer his
fear of crowds

  the chance came sooner than he ex-
pected

  it was after things quieted down in
shanghai and the authorities were look-
ing around for entertainment for their
men and for the foreign population as
usual they settled upon a smoker this
time an international affair as the best
bet fighters from all the various units
were to participate

  two men were eagerly sought for as
the details of the scheme were being
worked out a man to officiate as third
man in the ring and a match for
mauler benson light-heavy cham-
pion of the asiatic fleet

  people in the know came to gillis
but gillis shook his head

  ill never referee another bout he
told them

  and he stuck to his guns hed help
out in the corners he told them help
handle marine corps battlers do all he
could to get the gyrene scrappers into
shape

  they grabbed him as a drowning man
grabs at a straw they begged him to
groom some light-heavy who wouldnt
look too much like a dub against mauler
benson he agreed to try

  well go have a look at this bensons
workouts first he told the committee

  well the world is small after all
gillis had often heard the statement
but hed never thought much about it
until now

  he took one good look at mauler
benson he was older more expe-
rienced there was more gold in his
golden smile he was rugged fit an
animal whose forte was the squared
circle-a born fighter cruel merciless-
cruel and merciless as any crowd that
ever booed a losing champion or a
referee

  gillis thought it over for a moment
his heart pounding

  ive got a man for benson he said
at last

  but he wouldnt tell them who it was
he gave a name the first one that came
into his head and pretended that he was
keeping his fighter under cover which
he was there was a lot of excitement
as the time for the fight drew near
friends and enemies alike begged for a
look at the dark horse who was to face
mauler benson but gillis only grinned
and shook his head

  there was a stirring movement
through all the crowd when gillis man
stepped into the ring preceding benson
for the last bout of the evening then
they recognized the man

  gillis lieutenant gillis

  the shout went up rolling like a tidal
wave through all the crowd the crowd
seemed to be for him it always was
for the under dog up to a certain point
gillis waited quietly for benson to ap-
pear he waited patiently unbothered
by the uneasiness which possessed the
crowd

  then the mauler came down the aisle
and a second tidal wave larger more
mountainous swept in a vast crescendo
of sound through the tight-packed
crowd benson crawled through the
ropes strode to gillis felt of his taped
hands then he looked into gillis face
grinning showing his mouthful of gold
his grin faded slowly a puzzled frown
creased his low brow

  seen you before somewhere havent
i fella he asked have we
ever stepped through together be-
fore

  we did benson replied gillis
quietly you knocked me out in the
first round you wouldnt let me drop
you fairly slaughtered me for five more
rounds im going to pay you up to-
night 

  benson grinned

  more power to you kid sorry to
disappoint you ill carry you to the
fifth though

it wont last that long benson un-
less i hold you up like you did me
the crowd yelled for action benson
went to his corner he was still grin-
referees decision



ning but bis face was thoughtful
puzzled

  the crowd began its old chant

  knock the shave-tail for a goal
benson hit him with everything but
the stool

  the old fear came to gillis again as
he listened to the voice of the mob he
put his gloved hands over his ears
then feeling sheepish he took them
down again strove to shut his ears to
the shouts and cat-calls but his mind
went back to the time when he had faced
this killer before

  stand up and fight him gillis
youre laying down you yellow pup

  the bell clanged

benson came from his corner like
a cyclone gillis met him in the
center of the ring the fight that is
still talked of in shanghai had begun
benson drove both hands to gillis
stomach like twin sledge-hammers gil-
lis gasped started to lower his hands to
his mid-section saw bensons right start
the deadly drive at his jaw crouched
covering then uncorked both hands in a
series fast and furious of rights and
lefts that carried all the pent-up steam
of years of fearing the crowd-fear
which he owed to the man before him
the man with the golden smile

  bensons head rocked back snapped
forward as a left flicked into his face
as a right smashed to his heart benson
grinned he could take it hed al-
ready taken the best gillis could send

  he snarled bored in he rocked gillis
to his heels with a one-two that gillis
could neither duck nor block gillis
tried to clinch benson smashed his
nose filled the evening with dancing
stars pounded gillis to his knees with
murderous rights and lefts

  gillis staggered into a clinch ben-
son snarled in his ears

  still yellow he said still hang-
ing on rather than fight i remember
you now guess ill carry you through
after all and mark you so youll re-
member me some more

  im not a kid now wheezed gillis
gasping im going to break you to-
night benson youre dirty im go-
ing to break you

  it was bensons turn to gasp as gillis
fought his way out of the clinch bent
down to a fighting crouch his stomach
shrinking back against his spine dis-
appearing almost as a target for flying
fists sank his neck into his shoulders and
bored in he made little attempt to
cover now nor did benson both were
blood-spattered fighting furies as the
bell signaled the end of the first rouncl
they circled warily for a few sec-
onds to begin the second

  get him gillis dont let him get
you down

  the crowd again thought he was
afraid maybe he was but hed con-
quer his fear if it was the last thing on
earth he did he charged like a bull
went back to his heels swaying like a
tree as benson pounded relentlessly at
his heart

  gillis dropped to one knee for no
count dived in from low down raised
as he closed in and punished benson
fearfully with half a dozen to the face
and head benson grinned a born
fighter loving the ring was benson-
but dirty playing the game to his own
standards

  he knocked gillis flat on his back
with a haymaker that nothing could
block gillis rose groggily at the count
of seven staggering in arms wide un-
protected benson stepped inside bat-
tered him about the head and neck

  gillis chopped at bensons face bat-
tered pounded danced here and there
in and out fists working like pistons
licking out like serpents tongues

  benson drove gillis to the ropes drove
him through them with a right to his
suddenly relaxed stomach gillis was
back at the count of nine doggedly slug-
ging with this arch-slugger of the asi-
atic fleet

  a wall of fists-a circular wall clos-
ing on gillis he could see the
blows coming they landed sapped


fight stories

his strength his arms sagged sank
to his side benson mauled him un-
mercifully

  the crowd was in an uproar bellow-
ing for the kill gillis dropped rolled
to his back rolled to his stomach to his
hands and knees tried to pull his hands
loose from the floor-flopped down
the referee was counting the count
seemed fast

  gillis was saved by the bell

  he came out for the third staggering
he came out slowly hesitantly the
crowd yelled

  dont turn yellow gillis stand up
to him youre doing fine jar him
loose from his feet benson

  the call of the pack once more the
blood-lusting screams of men who like
the sight of blood

  the old fight of long ago came back
benson younger then grinning beating
him to a pulp making him seem to
clinch holding him up carrying him
through yellow

  benson straightened gillis with a blow
to the chin a blow that rocked gillis
made him sway like a limb in the wind
and snapped his head back his head
miraculously cleared the blow whirled
him around he saw his seconds sig-
naling making mad motions with their
hands saw their lips moving knew they
shouted encouragement then he saw
the towel in the hands of one

  he whirled drove benson against the
ropes close to his seconds

  if you birds throw in that towel he
snapped at them ill beat the heads
off both of you im going to win this
scrap

  the man who held it folded the towel
sat upon it grinning benson snarled
in gillis ear

  you think youre going to win
watch me if you still can see

  gillis started bicycling as benson
drove him unmercifully battering un-
resisted at his face head and body he
drove gillis into a corner gillis doubled
up covering his stomach and head with
hands and forearms benson stepped

back measuring his man gillis un-
corked like a jack-knife came out of his
corner like a projectile from a catapult
both arms moving in and out like
rapiers

  bensons grin faded as gillis came in
and would not be denied

  gillis grinned now taunting benson
he slugged benson in the stomach in
spite of years of training benson low-
ered his guard gillis aiming at the
button knocked out some of bensons
gold teeth spoiling any grin benson
might have started

  fourth round like the other three
benson leading a mile on points both
men arm-weary and punch-drunk

  fifth round toe to toe in the center
of the ring neither asking quarter nor
giving it gillis and benson slugged
sobbed with the pain of their own blows
became primitive men as they sought to
destroy each other

  take it back gillis mumbled ben-
son youre not yellow but take
the count and ill slip you a hundred
ive got everything up on this fight

  that fixes it mauler benson
gritted gillis here goes

there was no stopping gillis now
yellow he might be crooked never
he forgot the crowd in the one minute
left him as he should always have for-
gotten the crowd he drove benson to
the ropes rocked him doubled him up
punched him off balance

  the crowd was roaring but gillis
could hear not one word he could only
see the face of benson sick with pain
eyes glassy but ups set in a snarl gillis
drew back for the finisher

  a house seemed to fall on gillis
head he wras down his head weaving
from side to side the referee was
counting his second had grabbed the
towel again

  the referees hand had started down
on the fatal count when gillis ro
swiftly that the eye could scarccly fol-
low the movement charged benson al-
most from a x-rone position against
referees decision



the ropes he drove him again one-twoed
him mad with fury-and fear of his
own fear bensons face was beseech-
ing now

  one hundred dollars gillis

  gillis drove to the mans heart with
everything he had and benson went
through the ropes he went through as
if hurled from a catapult he was
horizontal as he passed through he
fell in the laps of three of his
friends who lifted him tossed him back
into the ring where he lay as one
dead

  gillis staggered to a neutral corner

  there was little need to count ben-
son dm out

  the referee stepped to the ropes
grasped them in his right hand

  lieutenant gillis gentlemen the
new light-heavyweight champion of the
asiatic fleet

  he had already lifted the right hand
of the winner

  gillis faced the crowd looked all
around the ring raised his hand for si-
lence it made no difference that the
british general was at the ringside no
difference that his own colonel who had
probably won a couple of hundred on
the fight was there nor that his battal-
ion commander was there he could ex-
plain to them later

  silence fell and from the mashed lips
of gillis like a cry of rejoicing came
words whose import only those in the
know could comprehend

  go--to-hell

  then he turned while the stunned
silence held for all of a minute and
helped to lift the limp body of benson
who still was in dreamland to the chair
his seconds had contemptuously tossed
into the ring

breed of champions

by jack byrne

he was born of a fighting breed-yet his very heritage made him yellow
a story of the amateur ring-of our champions of tomorrow whose only

prize is glory

the hardest blow joe dunn ever
felt was struck by his own right
hand it was an uppercut a
short one with not much punch behind
it and its force padded by heavy train-
ing gloves it landed just beneath the
ear of joe dunns son

  joe dunn grinned and side-stepped
lithely to avoid the swift counter he ex-
pected and then his grin was wiped
away and a tiny startled cry was forced
from his lips as he leaped in with both
gloves open

  for the kid was going down

  he was on one knee when joe dunns
hands reached him held him kid
   toe dunn whispered kid-i
didnt mean-

  and then suddenly his words stopped
gloved hands tightened on the boys
arm joe dunn down on his knees now
stared stupidly unbelievingly into the
face of his son except for his eyes
and the faint tremor of his lips it was as
if a great sponge had wiped all expres-



sion from the face of joe dunn  made
it blank-ghastly

  kid- his lips barely moved then
all at once his body stiffened and he
raised himself slowly to his feet leav-
ing the boy still kneeling there wearily
joe dunn drew the back of his glove
across his eyes almost mechanically he
bent down to tug at the glove-strings
with his teeth

  that will be all for today toe
dunn muttered

  his head was bowed and his eyes
clouded as he bent down under the ropes
and moved slowly away the kid till
knelt there silently

in the days before the war when joe
dunn was known as the killer
men used to say that hed take three
punches to land one many a fighter
had dropped joe dunn but none had
made him back up in his scrap book at
home was a treasured clipping that new
yorks greatest sporting writer had
breed of champions



signed it said that the shrapnel at
belleau wood which had torn into joe
dunns leg had robbed the ring of its
greatest fighting heart since the days of
ketchel and the dane

  perhaps that is why it hurt joe dunn
so much to see that his son was yellow

  he knew that the blow hadnt been a
heavy one he was surprised to see the
kid drop under it yet he thought that
it might have reached the button and he
knelt beside the boy penitent he was
only seventeen the kid was and joe was
afraid hed put on more steam than he
intended it was then he saw the look
in the kids eyes

  joe dunn had seen that look before
had seen it in the faces of whipped men
it wasnt the dull glassy stare that came
when a man was punch-drunk it
wasnt the dogged glare of a man who
is weakening and knows it no it was
something else again-a whimpering
sort of look a thing of sheer fear
many a time joe dunn had sneered at
it many a man hed taunted for it

  and there it was shining in the kids
eyes yellow

  never once did joe dunn look back
toward the ring as he moved stiffly
toward the little room he called his
office he didnt hear the shouts of the
other kids who were punching the heavy
bag and shadow-boxing at the other end
of the little gym for joe dunn was
sort of stunned couldnt yet believe that
his kid was yellow

  he sank into a chair and stared
blindly straight ahead it was a long
moment before he was aware of the
other man in the room he looked up
   captain parsons

  you look hurt joe parsons said
whats the matter the leg again

  worse n that captain joe dunn
answered worse n that

  parsons had commanded joe dunns
company in france it was he who had
given toe his chance as boxing instruc-
tor in the service who had fixed up this
job for him at the little club where he
could teach the neighborhood kids to

  f-june-

handle the gloves there wasnt much
money in it-just a living-but it had
given joe dunn something to do when
he came back and hed sort of enjoyed
teaching the lads enjoyed watching
young bob his son    until now

  its the kid-bob he said yel-
low  dully he told parsons what
had happened

  there was a bond of understanding
between joe dunn and this man who
had been his captain some men might
have laughed or tried to find excuses
for the kid but parsons knew joe dunn
knew how he felt he nodded

  wrhich means- he asked

  which means joe dunn finished
that the kid doesnt fight tonight im
sendin morgan in

  and that means parsons said
slowly that the shamrocks take four
out of seven bouts-

  joe dunn shrugged wordlessly

  -and that marty ford who coaches
them will get a nice job at the city
a c-a job that joe dunn deserves
that he can have if his boys win four
out of seven

  joe dunns eyes answered him hes
yellow joe said softly i saw it
and that was that wade parsons
late captain a e f rose without an-
other word and walked to the window
for a long time both were silent

  at length parsons turned to the door
i think he spoke softly ill hunt
up the kid-huh  maybe  

  ask one of the boys to send morgan
in joe dunn said want to have a
talk with him

young bob-was tying his street
shoes when wade parsons found
him the boy looked up nervously and
his pale face flushed a sudden red his
eyes fell and fingers fumbled with laces
that were already tight parsons put a
hand on his shoulder

  whats wrong son he asked
quietly

 young bob didnt look up he
squirmed his shoulder from parsons


fight stories

grasp pm all right he said huskily
lemme alone

  but parsons was sitting beside him
now listen here kid he was say-
ing i cant handle that line snap out
of it act your age young uncle
hector wants to know just what hap-
pened-and why

  young bob didnt change expression
didnt raise his head but slowly his lips
began to move he hit me the boy
said and i-i stayed down i-he-
well i guess hes off of me

  why did you stay down asked
parsons softly

  - the boys voice was husky-i
dont know maybe    maybe im
yellow

  wade parsons laughed then and his
big hands went out to grasp the boys
shoulder roughly he twisted the kid
around until their eyes met

  thats a lie he growled and both
of us know it now lets get the up-
and-up on this whats the matter
young bob swallowed hard i dont
know captain he said honest i
dont we were just sparring see and
he swung a quick one that caught me off
balance and then i saw his face-
and i remembered    and i stayed
down

  remembered 

  the kid nodded yeah his face
was like it used to be when they took me
to watch him fight i-i guess i was
just scared guess ive always been
scared of him so i stayed down
parsons big hands clenched hard on
the kids shoulders he understood for
he recalled the scenes of other days then
   joe dunn-killer joe-in his cor-
ner    his manager holding up joes
motherless boy to shake hands and wish

him luckthe white face of

the kid and his scared eyes suffering as
joe dunn bored through a rain of blows
with that fighting snarl set on his face
a moment of terror   

  why the kid was only six then-no
wonder the memory brought him fear
and joe dunn himself was responsible

for it he had made the boy afraid of
his own father

  yes wade parsons understood but
would joe dunn see it

  parsons slid an arm across young
bobs shoulders and pulled the boy
close i get you kid he said lets
go see joe

  but the boy held back aw no
captain he pleaded i cant its like
squawkin or something i-

  with the palm of his free hand wade
parsons tilted the boys nose -you
shut up he growled in mock anger
and listen to the doctor were going
to see that stubborn old man of yours
and im going to give him wade par-
sons famous lecture a to rebellious
sergeants if he doesnt cock an atten-
tive ear ill put him on k p for the
duration of hostilities

  bob dunn managed a wry grin
o k cap he said im game if

  they found joe in his little office
talking to two of his boys one was
morgan second-string -pounder  the
other was snell joes best light-heavy-
weight bobs father glanced up as they
came in and his eyes narrowed he
went on talking

you all you can do is keep rushing him
-keep talcin it an try for a haymaker
he lifted his eyes for just a moment
and they flashed toward his son i

  wade parsons cleared his throat

asked

  then wade parsons was leaning
over his desk listen joe he said
i wajat to talk to you now wipe that
dirty look oft your face and get this
ive been talking to the kid and i know
whats-

  wait joe dunn almost snarled it
he was half way from his chair and
his face was hard just what are you
going to talk about he asked throatily

  why - parsons was startled -
about this afternoon about the kid-
joe dunns fist crashed on the table
and joe dunns face was an angry mask
lissen cap he growled you aint
talkin to me see i dont want to hear
about it-dont want to think about it
ill-

  they stared at each other in tense
silence while young bob stood white-
faced behind them and the captains
eyes were first to drop for he knew
how joe dunn figured things he under-
stood

  all right joe he said quietly well
say no more about it but im telling
you now joe dunn were going to do
something about it

  he turned to bob cmon kid i
sort of got a hunch 

  they left joe dunn still standing
there his face white and drawn and in
his eyes a brooding anger

yellow light flooding the ring-
pad pad of swift feet on canvas-
the smack of leather against bare flesh
two white bodies weaving in and out
dodging parrying striking a hum of
voices from the watchers here and
there a shout again the slither of feet
and the thud of blows a mighty roar
from the crowd-hes down

  the arena was filled men and
women-mothers and fathers and sweet-
hearts-people from every walk in life
were jammed close high up the
shamrock rooters gathered in a body
and filled the place with din each time

their man struck the friends of joe
dunns third avenue boys replied to
each sally with rattles and whistles and
cheers at the ringside a sprinkling of
white shirts stood out against the black
of evening clothes close to the ring two
or three sports writers made lazy notes

  for it was well known that these
bouts were a sort of grudge fight be-
tween the shamrocks and the third
avenue a c also they knew it was a
test between joe dunn and marty ford
who coached the shamrocks there
was a fat salary attached to the instruc-
tors job at the city a c and the di-
rectors of that big club had been waver-
ing between marty and joe it was
common gossip that they would offer
the position to the coach whose boys
made the better showing

  the fifth bout was on each club
had taken two in the lighter classes
joe dunn was at the ringside crouched
down chewing nervously on a splinter
each time a blow started he shifted his
head each time one landed he seemed
to wince in sympathy  go easy
kid-box him    thats the way
   now-now the right-bring it
up the left    again-one-two

  clang its over

  theyre back in their corners waiting
for the decision joe dunn is wiping
his fighters face-telling him he made
a nice fight and it looked like hed get
the duke

  then the bell clangs for silence the
announcer raises his hand waves the
judges votes

  winnah    lutz

  the third avenue crowd howls
theyre clapping at the ringside the
shamrock fighter comes over to shake
hands and grin and say it was a good
fight and now two more are in the
ring and the bell is clanging again for
silence

  in this cornah fred davidson of the
shamrock s c    his opponent-
dan morgan    weights davidson
one-fifty-nine morgan one-fifty-six
three-quarters


fight stories

  his opponent-dan morgan the
echoes were singing in joe dunns
mind as he whispered in morgans ear
dan morgan-and it should have been
bob dunn he shifted nervously while
the referee was giving his usual instruc-
ts ns in the center back in the corner
again he took the boys robe and whis-
pered to him in a voice that sounded
strange

  make him mix it keep borin in
there and throwin em at him dont
let him box an dont let him tie you
up   

  the ten-second buzzer    the gong
morgan went out of his corner fast and
davidson met him quarter way they
seemed to hesitate as they came to-
gether seemed to be only a whirl of
flailing arms davidson gave ground
and morgan drove him against the
ropes morgans right and left flashed
out-seemed to have him pinned there
and then it happened

  even joe dunn didnt see the blow
start but he caught a glimpse of
davidsons right flashing up as the
shamrock boy bounced off the ropes
and morgan came plunging in with both
hands swinging and joe dunn shud-
dered as that right went home mor-
gan seemed to stop suddenly as it
struck then to wilt as his opponents
left sank below his heart he sagged-
fell-and even as he went down his
right was set to swing again but mor-
gans right would swing no more that
night

  they finally brought him around
though and he was able to muster a
grin when davidson came to his corner
you wont do that on me again mor-
gan said ill get you next time

  davidson laughed as their gloves met
but somehow joe dunn couldnt he
was thinking of bob wishing his kid
could take it like morgan did    well
that made it three all now it was up
to snell	 

  the shamrock crowd was still yell-
ing still making the arena echo with
their joy at the quick knockout the

beli was clanging vainly for silence but
they wouldnt stop to hear the an-
nouncer tell them that the winner was
davidson time one minute seven sec-
onds of the first round

  the shamrock handlers were leading
another man in now and joe wondered
vaguely why snell didnt come he
cast a hasty glance toward the aisle that
led to the dressing-rooms the sham-
rock man was in the ring was sitting
down while his handlers kneaded his
muscles tough looking baby joe
thought to himself  pretty cool and con-
fident for an amateur and pretty old-
looking too nice legs and well-mus-
cled arms his beard was sprouting
out blue-black and his confident smile
was gold-toothed looked bad for
snell   

  snell  where was snell  joe dunn
growled a hoarse order to one of the
seconds and the man scurried toward
the dressing-rooms joe bit nervously on
his splinter as the crowd began to shout
impatiently and clap mocking hands
snell should know better than to be
late   

  then some one was clutching his arm
you dunn the man asked excitedly

  yeah-hey whats wrong

  the stranger was pulling down the
aisle toward the exits quick he was
panting snell-hurt-wants to see
you   quick

  they were running down the aisle
while the crowd stared in wonder
now they were downstairs and the
stranger was pointing to the little rub-
bing-room near the showers

  in there he gasped and he fell
back as joe dunn darted in before him

  snell joe dunn shouted snell
where- and he suddenly realized
that the little room was vacant he
twisted about wildly and leaped for the
door just as the click sounded that
locked it

  joe dunn was bewildered-mad he
was shouting wild things as he hurled
his shoulder against the locked door
again and again he dashed against it
breed of champions



bruising himself without feeling it and
each time the wood hurled him back
he picked up a wooden stool and beat
wildly against the panels shouting as
he felt the door crack again he struck
and a white gash leaped up in the door
again    and again and now the
panel splintered and he tore at the open-
ing with hands that didnt mind jagged
wounds he jerked with all his
strength almost fell backward as a
loose slab came free then his hand
snaked through and he turned the key
he was running back to the ringside
furious with silent rage

  he burst into the arena like a mad-
man  had made three tremendous steps
down the aisle before he was conscious
of the roar that filled the place wildly
he stared around-up toward the yellow
glow which marked out the white can-
vas and the ropes in a square of gleam-
ing white and joe dunn paused sud-
denly as if a mighty blow had struck
him he gasped

  for in that square of light two fig-
ures moved-and one of them was a
tall yellow-haired boy with a very white
face young bob his son whom hed
branded yellow

the stranger had no sooner led toe
dunn below than the cat-calls of
the impatient crowd were silenced
from the opposite dressing-rooms
wade parsons came and behind him
was a tall white-faced boy with an old
robe draped across his shoulders they
hurried to the ring and parsons whis-
pered with the referee the judges
talked a moment then the gong sang
and the announcer was in the center

  in this cornah mike grosso of the
shamrocks    his opponent-bob
dunn who is substituting for kid
snell weights grosso one-seventy-
five one-half  dunn one-sixty

  a buzzing whisper spread through the
crowd fifteen pounds difference-
dunn was fighting out of his class
just a kid too and he looked whipped
already as he stood in the center listen-

ing to the referee then the buzz grew
to a deep hum as the ten-second horn
groaned it grew to a roar as the gong
rang

  they slid out to the center cautiously
and stalked each other for a moment
without attempting a blow grosso
feinted with a left and bob dunn
stepped back grosso snarled a laugh
and gestured him to come in and fight
another moment of sparring with
both moving closer then a sudden
shout from the crowd as they traded
rights to the body

  they were in close now their arms
moving like pistons glove thudded
against flesh grosso head down
stood toe to toe with the white-faced
kid and neither gave a step bob sank
a long left below grossos heart and
stiffened his muscles to take the return
blow but suddenly-out of nowhere
it seemed-grossos right swept up in
a fierce arc that ended with the kids
jaw and as bob dropped forward the
left crashed into his side

  it was then-just as he sank to the
canvas-that joe dunn burst upon the
ringside like a whirlwind he was
shouting but the sound was lost in the
maelstrom of the crowd he clutched
at wade parsons tried to tear his way
to the ring but parsons hauled him back
and scrcamed at him in return it may
have been something that joe dunn saw
in parsons eyes for a photographic sec-
ond-or maybe he suddenly knew-but
all at once they were quiet and their
eyes were fixed on the drama that was
out there on the white canvas

  five-the referees arm picked up
the timers count-six    seven-

  and the kid was up he was on his
feet and grosso was coming in with his
right drawn back for the kill but be-
fore he could strike bob dunn had
smothered him in a flurry of blows-
was driving him back to the ropes with
left and right left and right in a mad
barrage against chest and jaw and ribs
twice-three times grosso drove his
right but the kid didnt seem to feel it


fight stories

he was driving him back    back   

  joe dunn didnt understand didnt
care about understanding right then
for he had seen the kid get up and take
it he was in the ring automatically
was working frantically on the boy try-
ing to tell him with his eyes that he was
sorry and while he worked wade
parsons was shouting the kids story in
his ear joe dunn didnt hear it all
but gradually the idea began to dawn

  he said kid-

  and then parsons was pulling him
outside the ropes the gong

  bob dunn was out with a rush he
smothered grossos lead and tied him
up in the neutral corner for bob
dunn had seen in his fathers eyes that
it was all right again he knew in his
heart the words his father would have
spoken back there when the gong rang
he tried with a short uppercut and
grossos left flicked his face close
have to watch that

  he weaved in again took two jolting
shots to the body as he missed a long
one for the jaw they hurt hed have
to catch that left before it landed the
left    uh

  seemed funny to bob dunn that he
was down that one hadnt hurt much 
just knocked the breath out of him
hed get up without a count    what
were they howling for couldnt they
sec he was all right

  there he was up    something was
beating at his face and his stomach was
numb but he had to keep swinging he
had to show the old man that he could
take it left right    keep em going
keep pilin in-dont back up

  he didnt hear the bell was only con-
scious that those gloves were no longer
whipping at him and that he must cross
to his corner he tried to grin at par-
sons and his father and now they were
working on him water felt good   
their hands felt good    only one
round to go

  who is that guy talking to the old
man  whats that hes sayin about
grosso hes not an amateur huh

this newspaper guy has seen him work
on the coast    tells the old man to
stop the fight   

  stop the fight i the words leaped in
bob dunns brain and seemed miracu-
lously to clear it he drew an arm
across his eyes shook his head his
father was waving an arm at the ref-
eree to call him over when bob reached
up a gloved hand to knock the arm
down he turned on wad parsons and
his father and the newspaper guy half-
arose from the stool his eyes blazing

  stop the fight he sobbed youll
stop the fight you will like the deuce
-ill stop it

  the three stared at him

  kid- his father began

  gosh said the newspaper guy

  and parsons sort of gulped and
grinned and jabbed an elbow into joe
dunns ribs hell stop the fight
said captain wade parsons

  the gong rang before they could
snatch the stool from bob dunns cor-
ner

  the kid wasnt quite conscious of
what he was doing in that third and last
round he only knew that there was a
man out there who must go down who
must hit the canvas and stay there he
was out of the corner and met grosso
half-way with a right that he lifted from
the waist

  grosso countered swiftly sidled back
but bob dunn kept tearing in on him
he forgot to box forgot all the tricks
his father had drilled in him day after
day just punch punch punch just
punch and take it until something gave
he felt blows but they seemed to come
from far oft he knew he was tired
and it was becoming more difficult to
breathe but it didnt matter get in
there and take it

  now he was down   no he was
up again and his arms were swinging
sometimes he couldnt see grosso
sometimes he couldnt even see the light
   funny but it didnt matter all
he had to do was keep swinging em
keep his gloves going   
breed of champions



  then the haze cleared and they were
close together grosso was snarling at
him-or was he laughing at him  grosso
was hitting him in the face and he was
piling glove upon glove against the face
of grosso

  hit-hit-hit that face knock that
smile off of there    hit

  and all at once the face disappeared
and bob dunn had stumbled and was
clinging to the ropes funny    he
couldnt get up

bob dunn was all right though
when they got him down to the
dressing room they were still roaring
upstairs the sting of collodion was on
his lips and the burn of smelling-salts in
his nostrils he was all right though

  his father and wade parsons and
the newspaper guy were there they
told him how hed knocked grosso cold
with only twenty seconds to go-and
they said a lot of other things that made
bob dunns face red and made him say
aw-ww but he didnt really feel
good until kid snell came in with the
rest of the gang

   joe spotted kid snell right off and

  what in the blue blazes happened to
you he wanted to know where
were you in all the excitement

  kid snell looked a little scared i
was here all the time he said

  here

  yeah said kid snell pointing to
one of the lockers in there  i
was just gettin ready to go up see
when these two bozos- he gestured
toward parsons and bob dunn-come
down an said bob was to fight my
fight

  i said sure you are-like so much
applesauce an when bob reaches over
to get my robe i swung on him so we
got into it-an somethin must of hap-
pened-an when i come to i was done
up in towels an stuck over there like the
wet wash

  joe dunn tried hard to smother his
grin he shook his head reprovingly
at bob and wade parsons

  but wade parsons wasnt trying to
smother his grin

  i warned you sergeant he chuckled
that bob and i would do something
about it-and it looks to me like we
did

when dempsey took the count

   one legitimate knockout was scored against jack dempsey though it
is not in the record books when jack was training for the bill brennan
bout he engaged jamaica kid as a sparring partner the kid was big and
strong and could hit hard

   they were mixing it up in the gymnasium when jamaica let go a wild
right-hander that started from his heels it landed flush on the button and
dempsey went down and out he was unconscious for ten minutes and
jack kearns was scared to death

   when dempsey was working out for sharkey he had tilly kid herman
a veteran middleweight in his entourage tilly made the same sort of a
faux pas but his punch only rocked dempsey to his heels it wasnt strong
enough to keel him over herman was promptly discharged by leo flynn
wrho was handling the camp

   this may or may not be a warning to sparring partners you are never
supposed to hit the boss too hard there is another angle to it however
and that is that a man in training must protect himself as completely as
possible against injuries which might lead to a postponement of his match
or even endanger his career he must in brief get all the work-out possible
without running too much of a risk that is one of the many worries of
fight managers
famous fights i have

seen

ketchel and papke

by old-timer

ketchel was a fighter for you-a grim man with the tiger instinct the savage
slashing mauler with fury in his heart drama packed his life as tragedy
ended it-and the ring has never seen his counterpart

one of the most vivid pictures
the ring will ever show was
painted one october day in col-
ma california when stanley ketchel
stood looking down at the writhing
ebony body of jack johnson

  there was the greatest heavyweight
in the world a wonderful boxer a
clean sharp hitter a physical giant
whose more than six feet of perfectly
muscled bulk weighed two hundred and
ten pounds struck down by a boy who
weighed fifty pounds less and was four
inches smaller

  the fighting game has many black
spots against it-meanness treachery
and greed but it has its big moments
too

  and to my mind it will never have
a bigger one than came that afternoon
when stanley ketchel s smashing blows


dropped jack johnson to the canvas

  the michigan assassin fought sixty-
two battles before a bullet ended his
career at the peak of its glory fifty
of them he won by knockouts

  twice he was stopped once when
untrained and in wretched condition by
a man whom he defeated on three other
occasions and once by the huge negro
who outweighed him by fifty pounds-
the man who became heavyweight cham-
pion of the world

  there are several types of fighting
men

  the one is the business man the
clever speedy boxer who goes through
his entire career with an eye only on
financial reward he is usually a dap-
per fellow like benny leonard or
leach cross who when he retires has
a fortune the game is a business to
famous fights i have seen



him with little of romance or adven-
ture in it

  then there is the rugged shock-
absorber like battling nelson or ad
wolgast or joe grim-steel-ribbed
hard-chinned young men willing to
take a dozen punches to land one they
arent craftsmen or inspiring to watch
simply bulldogs with unquenchable
tenacity and unbelievable vitality

  and then there is the killer

  he is the man with the tiger instinct
the savage slashing fighter with the
lust of fury in his heart there is no
fear lurking in it he comes to kill or
be killed and he has the power to slay
the knockout punch that is deadly even
when he is battered and reeling and
blind

  do you remember kid lavigne in his
battle with joe walcott the ape-man
from the barbadoes the kid was lit-
erally slashed to ribbons one ear was
hanging by a shred he was bathed in
blood from head to heels yet he
stopped the fiery walcott

  do you remember terry mcgovern
with the senses knocked out of him by
that terrible hitter oscar gardner ris-
ing blindly at the count of nine to tear
in utterly unconscious of what he was
doing and lay gardner in the resin at
his feet

  do you remember the classic battle
between jack dempsey and firpo the
wild bull of the pampas when demp-
sey crawled back into the ring stunned
by the frightful blow that had hurled
him out of it and went raging into ac-
tion knocking firpo down time and
again until he had literally beaten the
resistance out of the huge bulk that
towered before him

the real killer is a comparative
rarity in the ring in him must be
combined not only the will to do and a
merciless heart but the sheer power to
accomplish his design

  and not in all the long history of
the prize ring has there ever been a
more ideal man of this type than stan-

ley ketchel the michigan assassin

  they didnt call him the assassin
in merry jest

  his real name was stanislaus kiecal
he was a pole one of that rugged
northern race the hardships of whose
ancestors bred strength of bone and
muscle high courage and ferocity in
battle

  when he tore at an opponent you
might visualize that foe as a don cos-
sack who had participated in a pogrom
that laced the snows of poland with
blood it was as though the one thought
in ketchels mind was to revenge the
woes of poland on any man who en-
tered the ring with him

  there is no thrown battle in the
assassins record he was a fighter
not an actor and he would not have
known how to fake a fight successfully

  he was fifteen when he ran away
from his home in grand rapids and
went out where the west begins fif-
teen-but a strong young fellow with
what the man in the street calls guts

  for a while stanley worked on a
ranch punched cattle but the monotony
bored him your killer of the ring lives
on excitement and action he must be
moving

  in  he drifted into butte which
was wide open and humming a tough
prize fighter named kid tracey had
won some measure of fame thereabouts
boxing bouts were popular but tracey
found some difficulty in getting any one
to meet him he was too good for the
sort of opposition that could be fur-
nished in butte

young kiecal was jobless and
hungry though only sixteen then
he had been through more than his
share of informal fistic encounters he
was unknown and inexperienced but
the killer instinct was in his heart so
he offered to fight kid tracey

  the great man scoffed he wasnt in
the habit of murdering kids he said
but the price of beans in butte was
high and tracey had to fight to live so


fight stories

he condescendingly agreed to fight that
polack kid from michigan

  it wasnt a fight in the real sense of
the word stanley ketchel as the an-
nouncer presented him to the crowd-
being unable to master stanislaus kie-
cal-flew at tracey like an unleashed
wildcat over swished his left hand
the hand that was to become so famous
in american fistic history down down
went the pride of butte his nose on the
canvas

  thus began the career of one of the
most wonderful fighters that ever lived
from then until the memorable fourth
of july  only three men lasted the
limit with him cagy old veterans who
clinched and clawed and did their best
to keep out of the way

  and it was on that fourth of july
that the fame of stanley ketchel really
began his name was a byword in
butte and gregson springs and miles
city and helena but beyond that he
was unknown

  the purses he earned were small and
he liked fun so when a dollar came
he spent it as recklessly as he fought in
the ring

  it happened at that time that joe
thomas was booked to fight in marys-
ville thomas had won the welter-
weight championship by knocking out
honey bill mellody and no one was
conceded a chance in the same ring with
him the local men declined to meddle
with his game so jim coffroth brought
the black-haired youngster as a sacrifice
on the altar of thomas record

  sacrifice

  ketchel lacked then the knowledge
that was to come to him later but he
was a killer then as always joe
thomas speed and ring-craft enabled
him to keep on his feet until the end of
the twenty-round battle but he was
hacked and beaten and dizzy when the
last gong clanged while ketchel was
still fresh and able to go at top speed

  no local favorite ever lost a decision
in marysville however so the referee
called the slaughter a draw

it was stanleys introduction to the
tricky side of the ring but it brought
him fame no one in the east had ever
heard of him but every follower of the
game knew joe thomas

  so column after column in the sports
pages of the metropolitan dailies were
filled with stories and conjectures about
this unknown

  just eleven months later ketchel
gave billy papke-who had scored sev-
enteen knockouts in twenty-four fights
and had never been beaten-a frightful
lacing before an enormous crowd in
milwaukee

  when referee jack mcguigan held
up stanleys soggy glove at the end
of that ferocious battle the latters
name was whipping over the wires to
every corner of the united states

  this boy who a year before had been
fighting before small-town audiences
for enough to give him a scanty living
stood on the threshold of a fortune he
had never dreamed of

  stanley ketchel was the man of the
hour-the greatest middleweight since
the days of jack dempsey the non-
pareil 

  no man of his weight-no champion
-has appeared since who compares
with him more favorably than a mexi-
can diamond would with the kohinoor
he possessed the vital spark the killing
instinct the punch that marked him
then as a wonder it developed with the
passing year

  had the bullet of a murderer not cut
short his career he would have been a
champion indefinitely certainly there
was  one on the fistic horizon when
he passed into the valhalla of fighting
men who had a chance with him

  i first intimately heard of stanley
ketchel from jim coffroth who staged
the greatest fights in the history of the
west and whose mission street arena
was the real fives court of america

  coffroth had come to new york
from milwaukee where he sat at the
ringside during the first ketchel-papke
fight
famous fights i have seen



  no other man of his weight could
have beaten papke but ketchel said
jim for he really is a wonderful fel-
low nobody but battling nelson
could have faced the licking bill did
without flinching and let me tell you
that this ketchel is a merciless tiger in
the ring

  they told billy to watch the kids
left everybody knew how powerful
it was papke rushed from his corner
carefully guarding for that left-and
pop quick as you could wink the right
went over and down he went it hurt
him so that he wasnt himself through
the rest of the fight

  ketchell isnt left-handed you
know i mean to say that he isnt en-
tirely dependent on his left as frankie
neil was he is a hitter from either
side and an awful punisher too why
the first time i saw him i was on fo
that

  he was playing handball and ordi-
narily a man plays strongly with either
his right or his left ketchel was there
with both and t figured right away that
he was a dangerous man to box with
wrhy they laughed at me when i
brought him down from marysville to
fight joe thomas they thought he
was a job

  guess i figured hinvto a nicety eh
hes an awfully decent fellow too
not red-headed as some of the papers
have it his hair is black as a spaniards
and he has dark eyes too quiet un-
assuming chap with few words to say
no braggart and never wants any the
best of it

tte doesnt need any the best of it

  a a hes the best drawing card in
the country today theres only one
who has a real chance with him thats
jack obrien  figure him the greatest
of all the fighters except ketchel

  i was in los angeles when tommy
burns and obrien agreed to fake their
go jack didnt train a lick burns was
working in a big pavilion and the
crowds there every day forced him to

go at top speed but obrien stalled
knowing that the go was to be framed

  three days before the fight we
drank four quarts of wine together
now you know as well as i do that any
man who is going to fight on the square
never drinks billy nolan was to take
obrien battling nelson and abe at-
tell across the pond and jack was to
fake with burns before leaving for
england

  at the very last moment bets were
declared off and obrien fell back in
his corner like a dead man he had
agreed to give tommy all the money
and part of the betting when he knew
that it was all off he had to fight on the
square and out of condition and he put
up the finest fight youd ever want to
see

  how was that for nerve

  jack obrien was the master boxer
of his division then a cool crafty
courageous man who knew every trick
of ring strategy though he had been
in the ring for fourteen years he was
then only a shade over thirty still in
the prime of his strength he had
twice beaten tommy burns before that
framed bout in the west and burns
later became heavyweight champion of
the world

  he was-as coffroth had hoped-to
pit his marvelous skill against the killer
instinct and terrific punch of the
young tiger from out of the west
and no fight in all the history of the
ring had a more dramatic ending than
the one that came with their first meet-
ing

  they were matched for ten rounds in
new york

  the east knew jack obrien they
had seen him in two hundred fights
they had seen him beat sluggers like
bob fitzsimmons and joe choynski
and joe walcott they had seen him
outspeed ring masters like kid mccoy
and jack blackburn

  what if this young galahad was the
greatest fighter they liad seen on the
gold coast in years


fight stories

  he wouldnt lay the weight of his
glove on jack obrien

  that was the verdict of the eastern
experts

  when the bell sounded for the finish
of that fight it interrupted the count of
the referee

  a man lay stretched flat on his back
battered into unconsciousness

  another stood in his corner looking
down at his fallen foe

  the man on the floor was jack
obrien the man on his feet was
stanley ketchel

  if you look in the record book youll
see the mystic symbol no dec-mean-
ing no decision-next to that bout but
no cleaner knockout was ever scored
had the round lasted two seconds
longer the bout would have gone down
in ketchels record as a knockout

  for ten rounds obrien matched his
speed and cleverness against the fiery
assault of the western killer but no
left jab could keep him away no speed
could evade the headlong assault of
stanley ketchel

  in that last round he caught obrien
literally herded him to his doom
smashing away with both hands until
the pride of philadelphia went down
and out

  three months later ketchel again
stopped him this time in three flying
rounds in which obrien was continu-
ally on the defensive beaten from pil-
lar to post and back again frantically
and hopelessly bringing into play every
trick and stratagem that he knew

  let it be said to the honor of the
dark-haired boy that no other man save
that mighty black sam langford ever
nailed jack obrien langford did it
in jacks last fight after he had been
softened by sixteen years in the hardest
of all games

  dont gather the impression from
what i have said that stanley ketchel
was merely a slugger with courage and
the killing instinct of a tiger with
those attributes alone he would never
have accomplished what he did he had

instinctive ring knowledge and speed
and shiftiness and no man of his
aveight unless it was that physical
freak bob fitzsimmons could strike a
harder blow

  there was so much drama crowded
into stanley ketchels life that it is
hard to pick out the bouts that were
most crimson with the flare of it

  the finest perhaps were his fights
with the illinois thunderbolt billy
papke his first meeting with philadel-
phia jack obrien and his match
with jack johnson for the heavyweight
championship of the world

  there were others just a shade less
so four times he fought joe thomas
the first was the native son draw
already alluded to then three times he
beat the veteran knocking him out in
thirty-two rounds taking a twenty-
round decision and then erasing him
altogether by stopping him in two
rough cantos

  he knocked out the welterweight
champion mike twin sullivan in two
minutes at colma then jack twin
mikes brother and buddy took the
quarrel upon himself jack had been
recognized as the middleweight title-
holder but ketchel toppled him over
in twenty rounds

  yes there was color and excitement
indeed to these bouts but papke
obrien and johnson were his foils in
battles that will go down as epics in
ring history

  they were of entirely different types
yet ketchel fought his swirling type of
battle against them all each was at his
feet one time or another twice he
rocked papke into dreamland and
twice obrien was unconscious when
the last bell tolled the giant johnson
too was smashed to the floor by the
ketchel punch backed by the ketchel
ferocity

  neither papkes savagery of attack
nor obriens consummate ring gen-
eralship nor the vast bulk and clever-
ness of johnson were entirely proof
against the killer
famous fights i have seen



  before his second fight with billy
papke ketchel became the victim of his
fair-weather friends then a good deal
more so than now the winner of a fight
was supposed to go out with the boys
to cut into the grape to show that he
was a good fellow

many a great ringman sang his
swan song to the popping of
corks and the michigan assassin came
close to being one of them he was
young and liked life and gaiety and
laughter he bad never known what it
was to have money before now his
hands were overflowing with it

  and remember that though he was
known as one of the greatest fighting
men in history he hadnt reached his
twenty-first birthday

  he was only a boy with a boys out-
look the future was a vague misty
thing and he simply did not bother
about it

  his training for the papke bout was
a farce he put no more intensive ef-
fort into it than jack obrien had done
for the framed bout with tommy
burns

  when he climbed into the ring be-
fore that vast crowd in los angeles he
wasnt brown and hard as he always
had been before there was a sallow
tinge to his skin a slight roll of fat at
his waistline

  and he was facing a man who
though not as great a killer as himself
was a frightful puncher and the sec-
ond best middleweight in the world

  when they stripped off their bath-
robes and stood in the center of the
ring listening to the referees instruc-
tions stanley ketchel looked at bill
papke and for the first time really un-
derstood the task that lay before him

  the illinois thunderbolt was as
fine as a man could be the muscles
over his stomach stood out in straight
hard ridges under his skin the huge
muscles crawled like living things his
mouth was set like a trap stanley
ketchel was the only man who had ever

beaten him and he was determined to
die before the ignominy should be re-
peated

  it wasnt in the assassins heart to
be afraid of anyone since their first
meeting in milwaukee he had known
what sort of a man he had to face but
the blandishments of his fair-weather
friends had convinced him that the task
would be easier the second time it had
been so with joe thomas-why
shouldnt it be with papke

  standing there waiting for the
brazen voice of the gong to send them
into action ketchel knew that he had
been wrong-that in the poorest shape
of his life he was meeting his most ter-
rible rival

  they went at each other like a couple
of bulldogs the assassin and the
thunderbolt came together in the cen-
ter of the ring bending forward to
the attack it was papkes right against
ketchels left and there was the thun-
der of thor in each neither backed
up an inch

  they smashed and hooked and ham-
mered each was shooting in his
punches straight and hard neither was
trying to block each was intending to
stop the other or be stopped himself
boxing was flung to the winds

  and the crowd stood up and howled

  the battle lasted twelve rounds and
every round was a martyrdom for stan-
ley ketchel yet battered panting
tired to the verge of exhaustion he
hung to his guns with fanatic fury

  he saw the kewaunee man through
a red haze but he kept shooting
punches from every angle few men
had ever lasted the limit with him and
even now he didnt believe that papke
could

  after every round the crowd dropped
back in their seats gasping it seemed
impossible that the men could continue
at that clip but continue they did-the
perfectly conditioned papke and the
burned-out ketchel

  in the last desperate twelfth round
the mob stood the blood crv choked in


fight stories

its throats-tense white as they saw
the greatest killer of the age go to his
doom

   thunderbolt billy a killer himself
put everything he had behind his right
hand smash in that round it caught
ketchel squarely on the point and he
went down dazed and bewildered he
was beaten then-bloody sick but un-
daunted

   he dragged himself to his feet slack-
chinned arms dangling the blood
drooling from his battered face to meet
his inevitable doom

  the crowd was howling now it was
in at the death

and great as stanley ketchel had
been in his hours of victory as
tireless on the triumph trail he was
greater now than he had ever been

  no towel was thrown in as a white
token of surrender for him to his
mind there was only one way that a
champion could be beaten and that was
by a knockout

  and papke cool and merciless ad-
ministered the coup dc grace with his
thundering right hand

  ketchel went down again this time
exhausted nature refused to respond to
the spurring of his great spirit the
referee counted ten over his prostrate
body and his seconds carried him
mournfully to his corner

  he had lost the middleweight cham-
pionship of the world

  yet it was destined that his con-
queror was to hold that championship
for the shortest time on record-until
poor little war-torn eugene criqui
came on the scene to take the feather-
weight championship from johnny kil-
bane and lose it to johnny dundee
within two months time

  the illinois thunderbolt won the
title from the michigan assassin on
september  on november  he
again sat in the corner opposite his
greatest rival

   but he faced another man altogether

  ketchel had turned his back on the

white lights and gay companions he
had gone off into the open breathing
the clear air of the plains purging his
system of the poison that had dulled it
before

   his eyes were bright his color high
once again he was the deadly tiger who
had strewn fistiana with the bodies of
fighters who stood between him and his
ultimate ambition

  there are dullards who say that a
man never comes back

   stanley ketchel proved that saying a
fallacy indeed

   this fight was as bruising and savage
and bitter as the other one had been
but this time it was papke who was the
victim he was game and a terrible
hitter and no man of his time unless it
was battling nelson could stand up
more staunchly under a frightful beat-
ing

   but no man of living flesh and blood
could have assimilated the unleashed
fury of stanley ketchel that night he
was a better man than billy papke he
knew it and he was there to prove it to
the mob that had howled joyfully at his
downfall two short months before and
he proved it in eleven rounds

   but luck refused to stay in the saddle
for stanley ketchel a madly jealous
man shot him down without warning at
conway mo on octobcr   ex-
actly a year after his epic battle with
jack johnson

   he was then only twenty-three years
old in the prime of his health and
power there were no men in sight
who had the remotest chance of beating
him his mind and heart were set on
another meeting with johnson whom
he was thoroughly confident he could
defeat despite the disparity in size

   he might have

   for to the killer like stanley ketchel
nothing was impossible the tiger
doesnt hesitate to do battle with any
foe-and no tiger was ever more dan-
gerous than the michigan assassin
when he crawled through the ropes
with the gloves on his mighty fists
the
unknown
kid

by
e r
vadeboncoeur

they touted him as the coming champ
but the wise money was on the other
fighter-and only the kid knew why

if the unknown kid had had his
choice he would never have alighted
from the train where and how he
did but a brakeman made the choice
for him so he unloaded abruptly on
the right-of-way just outside a tiny
somnolent country town ploughing up
a generous furrow of cinders in the
process

  the whole-souled jolting stirred
afresh rather than diminished his appe-
tite and when he pulled himself to his
feet the tall gangling redhead steered
a course for the nearest farmhouse he
ambled ludicrously along with his sham-
bling gait his abnormally long arms
dangling nearly to his knees his ham-
like fists swinging beside him perpetu-
ally clenched and apparently grown
that way

  the unknown kid didnt know that

the farmhouse he picked for his break-
fast was the country training camp
maintained by jim maxon for his string
of boxers neither did he know that the
dapper tricky little manager with the
drooping left eyelid was in one of his
jesting moods so when he volun-
teered to do anything for a hand-out
and followed maxon down the lane to a
barn he stepped into trouble up to his
ears

  before he realized it the kid was in
the cool smelly half-gloom of an im-
provised gymnasium and maxons
trainer spike dugan short snub-nosed
and as redheaded as the bewildered kid
had taken him in charge and was tying
a pair of -ounce gloves on his huge
hands

  maxon beckoned a swarthy athlete
away from his bag-punching and led




fight stories

him over to the redhead

  bo said he to the kid this is
battling rivers youre going to take
him on you look as though you had a
few laughs in you if you make good
you eat if you flop you dont go
to it

  the kids knees sagged battling
rivers he made a break for the door
but maxon caught his arm and swung
him back laughing harshly spike du-
gan looked up into the redheads terror-
stricken face and what he saw there
areused his sympathy

  aw say boss i dont think- he
began

  of course you dont think dugan
maxon interrupted him angrily youre
just a sap come on bo do your
stuff maxon spun the kid around
placed a hand in the small of his back
and propelled him out on the floor the
next thing the redhead knew something
thudded lightly on his mouth and his
lips went numb

  the kid was worse than frightened
he was downright scared his fear was
so obvious that rivers had little taste
for his work and danced around lightly
jabbing away with his left until the red
thatch bobbed like a cork but pulling
his punches steadily until maxon let out
a roar

  get in there rivers he yelled
this is a fight not a fox-trot quit
dancing and sock make him take it

  so rivers opened up he slipped
both hands to the kids lean stomach in
a lightning succession of trip-hammer
punches and as the redhead mouth open
and gasping doubled over with both
hands across his midriff rivers hooked
a vicious right swinging his whole body
behind it there was a sodden thud as
the leathern knuckles smote the un-
known kid fairly on the jaw and he
went down in a heap dizzy puzzled and
trying to figure out in his punch-addled
brain just what had happened

  for an instant he sprawled there
then something stirred under his fiery
mop a blind unreasoning wave of

hot anger swept over him he leaped
to his feet forgetting fear forgetting
pain intent only on annihilating that
dark scowling figure of torment before
him

  what followed was highly unortho-
dox and therefore doubly amazing
rivers smiling coolly stepped in to meet
the kid but his smile vanished in a
breath he found himself entangled
with a brick-topped cyclone fighting as
no self-respecting boxer would fight

  the kids head was hunched turtle-
like between upraised shoulders the
enormous hands on the ends of those
long arms were flying like thrown
sledges and they were not swinging
they were shooting straight ahead like
twin pistons in lunging irresistible
drives

  the redhead was upon his quarry be-
fore rivers could sidestep or duck the
battler threw up a guarding left but it
was brushed aside like a straw and the
huge fist catching him high on the fore-
head threw him off balance as he
wavered another crashed through and
he staggered back feeling as if his chest
wall were crumpled then he was en-
veloped in a rain of blows and went
down badly hurt his eyes slightly
glazed his breath coming in labored
sobs

  he dragged himself to his knees to
find the redhead looming over him still
in his queer turtle-like posture his blue
eyes aflame his mop of red hair bris-
tling he heard maxons shouts

  get up there rivers box with
him stand him off and cut him to
pieces flatten him for that

  still kneeling rivers shook his head
to banish the mists he inhaled deeply
and in a moment his eyes were clear and
he was on his feet dancing away from
the redhead who brokeinto pursuit

but this time there was a different
story rivers beat the kid to the
punch and the old fear welled up in the
redheads breast he retreated but the
leaping bobbing form appeared every-
the unknown kid



where and leaden merciless punches
caught him at every turn twice he
fell blinded helpless and when he
dragged himself to his feet for the sec-
ond time he was begging abjectly

  dont dont he moaned covering
his face rivers stared then dropped
his hands and with a muttered yella
stalked across the floor pulling off his
gloves in an instant spike was at the
unknown kids side leading him to a
water pail dousing his battered and
bleeding face and murmuring crude con-
dolences in his ear

  and watching the gasping blubbering
redhead through eyes that were mere
slits jim maxon was hatching a colos-
sal take the thing had been born in his
crooked brain as the kid launched his
furious offensive for a flash the scene
had been blotted out and maxon was
back at another ringside under a broil-
ing sun with  screaming shout-
ing fans in a delirious uproar as a red-
headed freckle-faced giant battered and
crushed down a heavyweight champion
to enthrone himself as the most beloved
idol in ring history

  well did maxon remember the little
procession that always wended its way
to the ringside when red bob fought
there was mrs bob wearing her trim
blue jersey and so small she could have
stepped under her big husbands arm
always mrs bob walked to the ring
hand in hand with red bob and on
red bobs shoulder rode a tiny carbon
copy of the fighter little bob was
four years old when his father became
champion and for two years he had rid-
den to the ringside for every fight the
tiny mite had been born with a birth-
mark-a clean-cut boxing glove of red
in the palm of his little hand

  little bob and his mark became a by-
word among fight fans and his father
and mother were completely wrapped
up in him

  the day after the big fight the blow
fell little bob disappeared there
was talk of kidnaping but no trace was
ever found red bob hung up his

  p-june-

gloves he never wore them again
somewhere out west the broken-
hearted champion and his wife bought
a ranch and retired to it their friends
saw them no more

  that was the story that flashed
through maxons mind as the kid ripped
and battered rivers for one inspired in-
stant it was in just that fashion that
red bob had waded through the tough-
est field of heavyweights in the worlds
history xo one had ever fought that
way before or since

  and now this tramp for just a flash
had duplicated the old masters famous
crouching lunging furious attack al-
ready the scheme was taking shape in
maxons fertile brain

  in half a dozen strides maxon was
across the floor and at the side of the
kid lying sprawled out his breath com-
ing in jerks while spike rubbed his
heaving stomach

  rip off that right glove dugan
maxon commanded and as spike
obeyed maxon bent over caught the
huge naturally-doubled list pried open
the ringers and examined the palm

  no callouses there he grunted
typical tramp ill bet he never
worked a day in his life doc ought
to be able to fix that up in short order
then to spike

  fix him up and put him to bed in
one of the bunks dugan then come
into the house i want to talk to you

  the scheme which maxon unfolded to
the little trainer made him gasp but his
protests only angered his chief

  never mind the buts maxon
snapped i dont need any sap to ad-
vise me youve got your job now
do it

  and so when maxon left for town
that night the unknown kid had a
home-temporarily at least-for the
first time in his life

  once decided maxon wasted no time
the next day a shifty-eyed bald-headed
man arrived at the farm with a kit of
needles and a collection of pigments
and chemicals for two agonizing hours


fight stories

the stranger pricked away at the tender
skin on the kids right palm when he
had finished the kids huge paw was
sore as a boil and swathed in white
gauze but under the bandage lay the
nearly-perfect outline of a boxing glove
in vivid red

  in the next month spike worked a
near-miracle with the unknown kid
sawing chopping and digging of deep
and useless holes hardened and dulled
the palm with its doctored birthmark
daily tilts in the gymnasium gave the
kid a smattering of boxing fundamen-
tals and a superficial finish sufficient to
deceive a casual observer

  the diminutive trainer gave his gan-
gling pupil much but he couldnt give
him heart he convinced himself of
that reluctantly for a real friendship
was developing between the oddly as-
sorted pair

  and then jim maxon returned he
summoned the redhead into the farm-
house uncurled the clenched fingers of
the ham-like right hand grunted satis-
faction and waved him out without a
dozen words

  its all set he confided to spike
later rivers is boxing babe barry at
the arena a week from tonight the
winner gets a crack at williams for the
title and the place will be jammed to
the rafters every sports writer in
new york will be there and ive slipped
this bum in for a ten-round semi-
final

  im fighting him under the name of
the unknown kid thatll get them
wondering and when he stops old joe
levin hell have them talking their
heads off

  but look here boss spike objected
levin can still fight even if he is get-
tin old hes a good main-bout draw
for any club and hes never been knocked
out

  maxon tossed his head impatiently
ill do all the figuring thats necessary
levin and  understand each other see 
all youve got to do is follow orders and
here they are so listen

there was a buzz of expectancy
as the big redhead strode down the
aisle to the ring followed by spike and
maxon the crafty manager had re-
fused to tell who the unknown kid
was he had refused to discuss him
at all no one had seen him  one
could find out anything rumors flew
through the crowd

  if there was a buzz when the kid
entered the ring when he left there was
pandemonium behind him levin was
cold in his corner spraddled across
the stool where his handlers had dumped
him after that spectacular second round
he had cleverly worked the redhead
into one of his furious fits of temper
then let one of the kids punches land
and the punch had dropped him like a
sack of grain-knocked out for the first
time in his long ring career

  maxon with spike was through the
ropes even as the referee finished his
count and raised the redheads hand
aloft they whisked a towel over his
shoulders a sweater over that a bath-
robe over all and before any one real-
ized what was happening the kid still
in his trunks was in a car with spike
and was hurried away from the club

  the next day saw the beginning of a
smoke-up that was a monument to the
cunning of maxon with boxing
writers talking of the reincarnation of
old red bob and fight circles agog
maxon became suddenly inaccessible to
the scribes he usually sought out him-
self for two days they speculated
they re-hashed the story of red bob
and little bob they told of the kidnap-
ping and the champions retirement
then maxon allowed himself to be
cornered

  what that bum nothing to it
you guys must be crazy he coun-
tered their questions with just the right
shade of insincerity hes just a tramp
 picked up go out and talk to him
yourselves

  they did they descended upon the
training camp and found spike as un-
communicative as maxon from the
the unknown kid



redhead they drew little more he in-
sisted he didnt know his name he
didnt even remember having any
parents

  finally they applied the acid test
they pulled off his training glove un-
damped the huge fingers and found
cuddled in the saucer of his palm the
boxing-glove birthmark

  from that time on the build-up needed

	nursing the discovery of little
bob given up for dead unwittingly fol-
lowing in his fathers footsteps attained
instant fame as the greatest of all sport
romances photographers invaded the
camp old pictures of red bob were
raked from dusty files and if they
failed to show sufficient resemblance
enthusiastically wielded air brushes sup-
plied the deficiency

  overnight the unknown kid stumbled
blinkingly into the limelight jim
maxon grinned knowingly but said
nothing

  read the papers they seem to -
know more about him than i do was
his stock retort

  if you dont think your hard-boiled
fight fan is foolishly sentimental con-
sider the eases of georges carpentier
and luis firpo consider what they
accomplished on a capital that was nine-
tenths color and one-tenth ability it
was on this generous gullibility that
maxon played and things came his way
rapidly

  offers flooded him but he scanned
all proposed opponents warily every
one with a real punch was turned down
without hesitation

  at last the chance he had been seek-
ing came and the unknown kid-still
billed as such-climbed into the ring
against lefty moore in his second fight
moore the logical contender for the
heavyweight championship was a phe-
nomenally cievcr boxer but a woefully
weak hitter and not too robust in ab-
sorbing punishment his skill had put
him above the ruck and kept him there

  maxon reasoned that the kids first
flurry of rage would brush aside moores

powder-puff punches and crush him
down before the boxer had a chance to
get started if moore weathered the
first storm and slipped over a smart cuff
or two the kid would fold up maxon
knew all this and he staked the success
of his whole scheme on the fight

  pie won in the first round

  again the unknown kid was rushed
from the ring his fatal weakness still
hidden while a frantic crowd swarmed
the aisles shouting and cheering for
little bob and fighting to grasp his hand
or pat him on the back

  and so the stage was set for maxons
big coup instantly lie accepted the
first offer of a tilt with marty johnson
the title-holder he knew it was to be
the end of the little comedy he knew
the clumsy timid unknown kid had not
the slightest chance of lasting more than
a round or two he knew the redhead
would quit-if not actually knocked out
-the first time johnson connected with
one of those pole-axing rights but he
had nothing to fear for himself no
matter how miserably the kid might
perform

  never once had maxon mentioned
the unknown kid except to deride him
if people chose to think that he jim
maxon was lying that was their own
hard luck and his bets-those juicy
sure-thing bets on johnson-would be
deep under cover hed see to that

  in the red barn preparations for the
big fight went forward busily like a
trojan spike worked with his protege
prepping him for the slaughter and al-
ways hoping that he might show that
vital spark of gameness that would en-
able him to go down in a fighting finish

  his hopes were fruitless and when he
piloted the unknown kid through the
huge coliseum to the ring he knew he
was bringing out a rank quitter

  he grinned as he and maxon fussed
over their man while the throng cheered
deafeningly but his heart was sick his
hand resting lightly on the redheads
shoulder detected a telltale quivering
as a new roar of cheers heralded the


fight stories

appearance of johnson he felt a dis-
tinct flinch and noticed that the kids
lips were trembling as the champion
hopped lightly through the ropes and
dropped coolly to his stool

  spike steered his sacrificial offering
through the formalities then he and
maxon slipped from the ring he caught
a flashing glimpse of the unknown kids
white face as he went and he could have
strangled maxon who crouched beside
him wearing his professional mask of
indifference

then the bell the fight was
on and it was a pitiful spectacle to
spike who knew what was happening
up there in the white light that bathed
the ring mechanically the kid went
through the motions spike had taught
him this time there was no stinging
attack to lash the redhead into fury
johnson sparring carefully was feel-
ing his man out a look of bewilder-
ment spread over his face he ccased to
frown he boxed carefully a moment
longer then he smiled

  deliberately and with perfect timing
the champion feinted with his left then
hooked his right at this ridiculous shuf-
fling figure the kid staggered back on
his heels then backed off like a sure-
footed tiger johnson flew after him and
unleased a terrific leaping right smash
in his flying onslaught he misjudged
his distance and the punch glanced harm-
lessly off the top of the thick red
poll

  then a howl went up that rocked the
roof the unknown kid was down
he had slipped to the floor almost be-
fore the glancing blow landed and was
lying there still and quiet

   it was all so pitifully obvious that the
crowd was up on the seats booing and
screaming quitter the referee bent
over as he swung his arm in the count
and barked sharply at the recumbent
figure under his verbal prodding the
kid dragged himself reluctantly erect
at the count of eight a vicious upper-
cut ripped through his half-hearted

guard and again he slumped to the floor
just as the bell ended the round

  hauled to his corner the redhead
pleaded for mercy im done he
wailed  at guyll kill me if i go out
there again lemme go please hell
kill me i tell ya hell kill me

  now it was no part of jim maxons
scheme to have the kid quit in his cor-
ner things like that cause held-up
purses gossip investigations and other
unpleasant things so maxon talked
dutch to the kid

  listen to me you big stiff he
grated into the redheads ear at the
same time raising the kids water-
bottle significantly into view do you
see this bottle well im going to
cave your yellow skull in with it if you
dont go out there when the bell rings
and take your medicine stick out your
chin and stop one rhe sooner the better
but you cant dog it in your corner
snap into it

  the unknown kid did as he was bid-
den slowly uncertainly he advanced
from his corner for the second round to
be met by the dark-browed champion
leaping across the ring to end the farce
contemptuously the title-holder jabbed
a rapier left in half a dozen lightning
stabs to the mouth and blood spurted
from the kids lips to trickle down his
chin he was looking for his chance to
drop and as a looping punch thudded
over his heart he folded his knees clum-
sily and went down on his face quit-
ting cold

  it was just at this point when ac-
cording to maxons scenario the farce
should have ended that two new actors
stepped in unnoticed in the din a
huge old man stoop-shouldered but
powerfully built had upreared his bulk
from an isle seat and started for the
ring

  a broad-brimmed black hat was
jammed down on his head and his right
hand clutched an umbrella by the middle
until the knuckles showed white through
the skin

   his left hand was closed over the tiny
the unknown kid



hand of a sweet-faced little old lady who
walked beside him so tiny she
could have stepped under his out-
stretched arm without ducking her
bonneted head

  the couple reached the ringside just
as the unknown kid took his final
flop just as the referee started his
toll for an instant the big mans eyes
swept over the ring then he reached up
and out with the handle of his umbrella
and tapped smartly and steadily on the
ring floor

  in one buzzing ear of the redhead
flattened down against the mat came
that imperative rapping strumming hol-
lowly on the raised planking like a
pounded drum

  -three-four-five- droned the
referee

  slowly the kid rolled over and his
half-closed eye fell upon the leonine
head and shoulders of the tapper rising
above the edge of the ring the big
mans blue eyes were pinpoints of glint-
ing steel his face wore an angry flush
and he spoke in a booming big voice
that carried clearly to the redhead

  boy he thundered leveling his um-
brella at the kid get up

   -seven-eigh t-n i ne-

  the unknown kid came up from the
floor why he did it he didnt know
but he scrambled to his feet in the nick
of time and swung apprehensively
around to meet the next assault it
came in a leaping bobbing slashing at-
tack and the redhead began to wilt

 from somewhere behind him he
heard that booming voice again

  fight boy fight

  a nasty left hook barely falling
short scraped agonizingly across his
face from deep down in the breast a
hot tide surged up engulfing him in an
insane fury with a perceptible jerk
his head dropped down turtle-fashion
bis shoulders hunched up into a protec-
tive cradle his body swayed forward
and launched out

  for just a breath that eternally
booming voice goaded him on then it

was drowned in a vast roar for the
crowd sensed the drama taking place
there at the ring the supposed little
bob was fighting agaii and old red bob
miraculously appearing out of thin air
was tongue-lashing him into a brick-
topped hurricane

  and like a hurricane the unknown
kid went after the champion driving
those crushing piston punches the
first caught johnson on the right shoul-
der and spun him like a top the second
thudded solidly checking the title-holder
in midspin and sending him headlong
across the ring to slide to a stop with
his head hanging over the edge of the
platform

  this time it was johnson who was
saved by the end of the round gasping
through his wide-opened mouth the
champion caught at the ropes hauied
himself to a swaying upright position
then staggered to his corner as the bell
pealed a life-saving clang

  behind him the referee and a yelling
joyous spike grabbed the raging red-
head by the arms and dragged him
kicking and struggling to his corner

  and now maxon his face livid came
leaping into the ring elbowed spike
aside and pulling a bottle of smelling
salts from his hip pocket swung it
briskly upward ostensibly to give the
kid an inhalation

  like a flash spike acted his hand
lashed out struck maxons wrist and
the bottle instead of discharging its
fiery liquid accidentally into the red-
heads eyes went sailing over the ropes

  came that great voice again

  thanks spike

  old red bob was in the ring

  a big hand closed around maxons
arm and propelled him from the corner
red bob stooped over the panting kid
now half dazed and gazing dreamily off
into space

  come out of it boy he admonished
and slapped the flat of his big palm
smackingly across the redheads jowl
the unknown kid came out of it with a
start to find himself staring at a wag-


fight stories

ging finger and listening to amazing
words

  your old mans talking to you now
son the big voice was saying and i
mean business  didnt come two thou-
sand miles to find my son a coward i
you dont march out there and flatten
that fellow im going to take you home
and thrash you to within an inch of
your life

 vaguely the unknown kid became
aware of a tugging on his dangling
glove he leaned over and stared down
into what he thought was the sweetest
face in the world tears streamed
down the upturned cheeks of mrs bob
as she stood on tiptoe to reach that
huge hand with both her tiny ones

  bobby-bcy she pleaded dont
make your daddy and me ashamed of
you dont be-yellow

  what happened in the third round is
ring history the unknown kid new
from his corner an irresistible savage
when the bell rang he met johnson
in mid-ring and for just an instant the
two traded thumping killing punches

  then the champion broke ground the
redhead after him a terrible right
straight from the shoulder crashed full
into johnsons face and he was cata-
pulted stiffly against the ropes the taut
strands tossed him back in a rebound
to meet a pile-driving left squarely on
the point of the chin and like a limp
cloth figure he collapsed in a heap
there was no need for a count   

maxon went up the stairs two at
a time he had confirmed the
bad news his commissioners had placed
every cent he had given them and it was
lost irretrievably it was not in the
nature of the man to take his loss si-

lently he was out to square accounts

  bursting into the crowded dressing-
room he pushed and shoved his way to
the chair where the unknown kid sat
grinning happily red bob stood by
smiling proudly at the new champion
while mrs bob fussed busily over a
deep cut in the kids cheek and spike
chattering deliriously pulled oft the
soaking gloves

  just one minute maxon shouted
confronting the big old man youre
red bob i remember you dont let
this bum gyp you hes a faker and i
i can prove it look here

  maxon snatched at the unknown
kids right hand hauled it up into view
uncurled the fingers and pointed accus-
ingly at the birthmark

  he took me in too maxon yelped
that mark was put there by a tattoo
sharp not six months ago i can
prove it

  before any one in the stunned group
could speak spike had crossed the floor
in a bound his face flaming he faced
maxon determinedly for the first time
in his life thrust his jaw forward and
spoke

  wrong again you big stiff thats
the second time tonight now im
gonna tell you somethin when you
framed this deal you made one big mis-
take you looked at the wrong fist
hold out your left hand kid

  the kid held it out and there redly
dim and dull but unmistakable lay the
irregular outline of a boxing glove

  ya see that maxon  spikes words
cracked as though they were flipped
from the end of a buggy whip i knew
that six months ago but i didnt tell
ya cause why cause yer just a big
sap

by jimmy de forest

           trainer of champions

  jmtny de forest knows every phase of the fight
game in his career extending over a period of
more than thirty years he has served as a match-
maker for various clubs as manager of fighters and
as a trainer and conditioner in this latter work he
is world-famous having trained champions in every
class including jim jeffries jack dempsey and
many others perhaps his most notable work was
his preparation of jack dempsey for the willard

condition is a word that has
many meanings but when its
used by a physical trainer it
means the state of health of the human
body the study of condition and how
to obtain it is not only interesting but
it is of the utmost importance yet it is
surprising how few people begin this
study until they have lost their health

  a few years ago i conducted a col-
umn of questions and answers for one
of the big metropolitan dailies and be-
fore the column was a week old i was
receiving on an average of five hundred
letters a day the surprising thing to
me was that i got these letters from
men and women of varying ages be-
tween eighteen and sixty years now
i was prepared for queries from per-
sons in the forties for that is about the
time of life when one begins to fail
physically i mean that is the time when
persons begin to realize that they are
failing

  but most of the questions had to do
with weight-reducing or building up i

fisht when dempsey won the championship in this
department in fight stories he will give you the
benefit ot his extensive knowledge on matters of
physical fitness he will answer your questions ad-
vi you of correct training methods exercises diets
etc young men who pride themselves on a clean
healthy body high school and college athletes men
in all walks of life in fact may turn to him tn
these columns for help

received so many of these that i finally
wrote an article on girth control in
which i told in detail a method of build-
ing up to normal weight and a method
of reducing to normal i was sorry
afterward that i did this for it kept me
busy for a long time with a clientele of
correspondents who evidently believed i
had nothing else to do but prescribe
diets for invalid relatives and under-
nourished babies

  it is not my intention in this article
to take up the matter of girth control
i will go into that thoroughly in a future
article i am merely concerned at pres-
ent in telling how good physical condi-
tion may be attained

  the two things most essential to a
healthy condition of course are diet
and exercise one must eat properly
to nourish the body and its glands and
organs and one must exercise in order
to prevent stagnation sunshine and
fresh air are concomitants you could
diet and exercise all you want but if
you were encased in a compartment




fight stories

filled with foul air and without sun-
shine youd die very quickly

  so far as diet is concerned that is a
problem that must be worked out by
the individual if you happen to be
overweight you must cut down on the
amount of food that you take every day
i do not advocate the cutting out of
sugar fat starch or any essential food
entirely for it is necessary for a person
to maintain a balanced diet whether re-
ducing or building up but to reduce you
must curtail the amount that is taken
into the body i always have maintained
that it is better to under-eat-that is
for an adult to under-eat-than it is to
over-eat

  recently i received the following let-
ter which is typical of many that i have
received perhaps it may fit the case
of some of the readers of this article

dear jimmy

   i am forty-one years of age of late i have
been going through a set of exercises every
morning which was advised by my doctor
but i find that the slightest exertion tires
me when  was in college i was one of
the star athletes having rowed on the crew
and played on the football team i also took
part in track athletics doing the quarter in
pretty fair time for those days the doctor
told me i had been leading too sedentary a
life and that i needed exercise he pre-
scribed ten minutes a day but im all in
long before i have exercised five minutes
do you think the exercise is too strenuous
or what will appreciate your advice

                       sincerely

william b walsh

  if i had received a letter like this
ten or fifteen years ago i would have
hesitated to answer it because i never
liked to step into the picture when a
physician was on the job but about
five years ago one of the official medi-
cal journals took an editorial rap at my
writings when i published a series of
articles on diet exercise and health for
one of the big news syndicates saying
that it was a fine state of affairs when
great newspapers would publish such a
series by a trainer of prize-fighters
instead of getting a reputable physician
for the job or something to that effect

  i spoke to a friend of mine one of
the most prominent medical doctors in
this country and he laughed that
shows what that writer knows about it
said my friend you are doing a good
work jimmy far from taking the
bread out of the mouths of the doctors
as this editorial veiledly accuses you are
a help for you bring people to a real-
ization that they should watch their
health

  i wrote a sharp note to the edito-
rial writer and received an apology
and now to get back to mr walsh

the doctor is perfectly right sir
in ordering exercise in your case
but he evidently counted on your co-
operation there is a grave likelihood
that your heart may be slightly enlarged
as a result of your early strenuous ath-
letic activities from yqur letter i
guess that you must have ceased to ex-
ercise long ago else the doctor would
not have ordered exercise for you and
you wouldnt tire so quickly

  now all you have to do is grade the
vigor of your exercise dont go at it
right from the start as if you were try-
ing to set a record exercise at only
half speed and exercise only until you
begin to feel tired then stop also
alternate your exercises with a deep-
breathing exercise that is stop every
minute and take a few deep breaths
enough to make you feel comfortable

  in this way you will find that in a
few days you have gotten so that you
can go through the allotted ten minutes
of exercise without tiring

  some years ago i formulated a rule
which i called the heart exercise creed
as follows rest completely as soon
as the exercise causes shortness of
breath heart-racing oppressed feeling
in the chest or fatigue

   that i have found to be die best rule
for regulating exercise for any individ-
ual regardless of age sex or physical
condition you can see that by follow-
ing this rule even mr walsh can easily
get in his ten minutes exercise a day
keeping fit



his doctor told him to exercise ten min-
utes a day but i am sure he didnt
mean for him to pile it all in ten con-
secutive minutes my advice to you
sir is to follow your doctors orders to
the letter-exercise three minutes in the
morning four minutes in the afternoon
and three minutes in the evening that
will make up the ten minutes your doc-
tor will be satisfied and you will be
greatly benefited

  that advice applies only to mr walsh
but remember a great many more hearts
are hurt by insufficient exercise than are
hurt by excessive exercise the busi-
ness man of today is apt to pen himself
up in his office for months at a time
neglecting to take regular daily exer-
cise it is the exercise of today that
counts not the exercise you took on
your vacation last year

  heres a letter from a young man
whom i judge to be about twenty-five
or twenty-six years of age

dear mr de forest

  the other day t played a game of hand-
ball with a friend from the office in a down-
town gymnasium i won but it was a close
game and right after it i collapsed completely
i became deathly sick and had to go home
being unable to return to the office that day
i am young and have been an athlete since
i was a kid only last summer i played on
a basketball team for two weeks and you
know thats as strenuous exercise as a fellow
can take this collapse has me a bit fright-
ened can you advise me please

sincerely

william j bulger

  p s-i have been working very hard for
the last three or four months do you think
i am being overworked w j b

  now this young man has told his
whole story in that postscript to his
letter he has been working very
hard and therefore has had no time
to take any physical exercise after a
lay-off of several months he goes into
a strenuous competition in which he
carries along after his heart has warned
him to stop the game was close and
because he is young he was able to force
himself out to the limit only to have
the old heart chastise him when it was
all over for disobeying its warning

the only trouble was mr bulger
that you piled too much ot a load
on to the heart you drove it along at
top speed just a mite further than it
was prepared to go perhaps it was
not so very long after your luncheon
that you went into the game and the
heart had not gotten a sufficient amount
of rest after going through the rather
arduous task of helping in the process
of digestion

  at any rate if you would apply the
heart exercise creed that i have out-
lined above you would avoid any such
unpleasantness if you had merely
called time when you felt tired and
taken a minute or two of rest you
would have been able to go through
with the game without serious conse-
quences

  but even so after a long lay-off from
exercise it is imperative that you do
not begin to exercise with a spurt no
man should begin violent exercise of any
kind without some preparation for it

  in conclusion i want to say that i am
not advocating laziness in exercise
merely going through the motions does
not constitute real exercise i regard
ordinary walking as no exercise at all
any more than i regard ordinary breath-
ing as exercise why eating a meal is
more exercise than either of these two
things unless they are done with a bit
more vim and vigor than the ordinary
routine walking and breathing

  if a person will step out briskly
swinging the arms and stretching the
legs exercising the call muscles and the
ankles and the toes then walking is a
great exercise but if one merely rolls
or lolls easily along strolling listlessly
you can see for yourself that there is a
slight motion at the ankle a very slight
motion at the knee and a slight motion
at the hips the upper part of the body
remains almost stationary

  so much for how to exercise in my
next article i will take up the matter
of reducing to a normal weight in sci-
entific healthful manner

champion at last fame and wealth within his grasp yet peter anson
remembering a promise turned down his first big battle so they

framed him-i

though peter anson won the
heavyweight championship of the
world by stopping tommy cripps
in eight rounds he continued to live in
a single room of a flatbush boarding-
house in this he was unique scan
the list of champions from broughton
downward you cannot name another
one than anson who failed to make a
splurge following his ascension to the
purple

  the new title holder did not stay in
flatbush from choice a cramped
room with an outlook over backyards
festooned with clotheslines was not an
ideal setting for one who loved the
open nor do meals served by board-
ing mistresses compare with the ambro-
sial concoctions of scotti at the ritz
however not having money anson
could not spend it all he earned prior
to his title-winning tilt had gone to pay
the debts piled up by his fathers failure
and death his end of the purse for
beating tommy cripps had been scarcely
large enough to cover training expenses


  one golden spring evening after
supper anson went up to his room
pulled a chair over to the open window
lit his pipe and solemnly regarded the
landscape it consisted of a variegated
collection of undergarments drying on
lines a brigade of discontented cats and
a colorful slice of sky to the heavy-
weight champion of the world it was
more than that for marigold havens
window fronted his own across the
width of two yards-and marigold was
the girl he loved

  he was not thinking of his stringent
finances for with worlds champion
tacked on to his name that difficulty
would soon solve itself he was puz-
zling over a most unusual promise that
he had given marigold

  some one knocked on the door with
an energetic fist that disregarded the
thinness of the panels at peters invi-
tation to enter a breezy man in a check
suit and fedora hat came in apparently
suqdrised to find the champion in such
poor quarters

by bill britt
f ramed



  hello ted said anson recogniz-
ing the boxing promoter

  in his characteristically brisk way
ted richards returned the salutation
drew up a chair and plunged at once
into the object that brought him there
he offered anson a fabulous sum to
fight gunner brown the english heavy-
weight champion and the only man in
the world conceded an even chance with
the big american

  peler listened quietly and then de-
clined the promoter was plainly
astounded

  but-but you cant refuse he pro-
tested two hundred thousand for
your end and-why ill even strain a
point and make it a cool quarter of a
million

  i couldnt do it if you gave me one
side of broadway from forty-second
street north

  youre not signed with some one
else

  no

  richards shook his head helplessly
then im blessed if i see how you
can afford to turn me down you
need money and i know that youre
not afraid of the britisher come
peter use a little judgment get yours
while the getting is good

  anson wanted to a purse of that
size would enable him to quit the game
-clean up the balance of his fathers
debt-marry-but he could not accept it

  why wont you demanded rich-
ards

  peter said quietly im engaged to
gunner browns stepsister she asked
me not to fight him and i promised
and you cant buy my word you know

  ted looked in the champions steady
eyes and understood that argument was
useless so he shook hands rather awk-
wardly and went away

  peter leaned back in his chair dead
pipe dangling in his fingers and con-
jured up in the sunset a vision of mari-
gold with her thunderous copper hair
and blue eyes perhaps she might re-
lease him from his promise but he did

not intend asking her to he sat there
for several hours thinking

  a shrill treble piped through the key-
hole hey youse in dere wake up
heres a telegram for y

  bring it in called anson and an
impudent mite popped into the room like
a blue-clad jack-in-the-box

  the wire was from leslie gribble
president of immortal players inc

    will you accept two thousand
  dollars weekly on ten weeks con-
  tract to appear in photoplay to be
  produced by this company if
  agreeable wire acceptance to film
  city office of this company on
  your way ivest stop at our chicago
  office and sign contract with mr
  mayer there he has been in-
  structed to advance you whatever
  sum you desire report to our di-
  rector john hallahan in film city

                   l l gribble

  anson creased the yellow slip in his
fingers and smiled that slow inscrut-
able smile of his he scribbled an ac-
ceptance and gave it to the boy with a
half-dollar

it was seven oclock of a southern
california morning so perfect that it
thrilled even the hearts of native son
press-agents at that hour stars of the
flickering film roll about beneath silken
sheets and curse the industry that makes
them rise with the chickens dynamic
directors tear through breakfast with
one eye on the clock and the other on
atmospheric conditions and extra
people after inking frayed edges of
trouser or skirt start off to haunt the
lot

  peter anson being none of these
neither growled nor hurried he
strolled out the santa ricoro boule-
vard wondering just what paces di-
rector johnny hallahan would put him
through more than one person who
did not know the champion turned to
admire the acme of physical perfection


fight stories

he represented the sunburned tone of
his skin was darkened in comparison
with his blond hair his shoulders were
broad but not bulky enough to detract
from the tiger-like iitheness of his body

   early as it was and peaceful as were
his inclinations the champion had al-
ready engaged in one altercation that
morning-a sordid little affair with a
chap who lived with his brother at the
boarding-house coming down from
his room anson found this fellow shak-
ing a girl peter seized him by his
beefy shoulders and sent him spinning
away the man flung out his arms in
a wild effort to retain his equilibrium
then went down heavily anson looked
at the girl the sleeve of her dress was
ripped sufficiently to disclose a purple
bruise on the skin

   please go she whispered so peter
left them

   lie thought of the affair now as he
strolled out of film city occasional
roadsters of violent color rushed by
spurting up clouds of dust they
were manned by ambitious directors
chafing at the limitations of time

  by this time peter had passed the
pretentious rows of residences that
line santa ricoro boulevard a mile be-
yond film citys limits their scramble
of architecture had merged into frankly
utilitarian buildings - the hangar-like
factories of canned drama as a future
worker in this environment the cham-
pion looked about with interest a sign
on one of the buildings informed him
that it was the business office of immor-
tal players inc

  a moving-picture cow-puncher ar-
rayed in the conspicuous habiliments of
his calling lounged on the steps rolling
a brown-paper cigarette with the fingers
of his left hand he looked up-recog-
nized anson from the pictures he had
seen in the papers-and nodded not
abashed as some fight fans are by the
proixmity of greatness

   hello peter he grunted

  hello can you tell me if mr hal-
lahan is here yet

  yeah johnnys in the office chewin
the fat with old gribble theyre most
probable framin up some pretty tough
stunts for you-the slave-drivers
gribble said anson hesitating
with his hand on the doorknob oh
yes hes the president of the company
isnt he what sort of a chap is he
you dont know him

  no i have never had the pleasure
of meeting mr gribble

  the cow-puncher blew a smoke ling
into the air and watched it shred out
in the sunshine

  gee but youre lucky he said

johnny h allah an director-
in-chief of immortal players inc
shoved the advertising section of the
film city gazette across his desk into
the damp pudgy hands of president
leslie gribble the latter adjusted his
glasses to the bridge of his fleshy nose
and read the item his editor pointed out

  wanted an englishman six foot tall
over one hundred and eighty pounds must
be skilful boxer apply to john hallahan
immortal players studio santa ricoro boule-
vard city

  there leslie said hallahan is
what you ordered-and look at the re-
sult the waiting-room out there is
filled with ten tons of pork-and-bean
fighters whose only knowledge of eng-
land is that its the place where joe
beckett gets licked yet every one of
them will try to convince me that he is
still seasick from the trip over it isnt
such a bad idea to stage a picture with
the worlds champion as a star-but why
an englishman for his opponent why
not a siberian tennis champion or a for-
mosan crochet star  i suppose you think
ive nothing else to do but pick out
slack-chinned johnnies with buck teeth
and yellow hair

  if hallahans asbestos hide could
have been withered by a look gribbles
would have accomplished it

  youre a good director my boy he
said but you dont know everything
this is the first step in taking mr an-
framed



sons championship away from him
  what do you mean

  just this gunner brown is the
only man in the world with an even
chance of beating anson-and peter
wont fight him i dont know why
hut ted richards called me on the long
distance and told me and ted doesnt
speak until he is sure of what hes say-
ing well ive got the gunner here in
film city all ready to go on with
anson

  you said peter wouldnt fight
thats where the idea comes in im
going to send anson out into the santa
catalina hills on location for a couple
of weeks he hasnt a manager or any
friends to keep him posted about whats
going on you can see to it that he
isnt in good shape when he comes
back

  what then 

  ill put up an arena announce a
fight between anson and brown
peterll go into the ring thinking that
it is part of the picture and then the
gunner can knock him for a goal while
we clean up on the betting

  the director scoffed theres a
million reasons why you cant pull off
anything like that and ill tell you fifty
or sixty of them in the first place
anson wouldnt fall for it in the sec-
ond even if he was trimmed nobody
would take it seriously because it w-as
in the movies-

  youll understand in a minute ex-
plained gribble tolerantly i have
peters signature on a contract to fight
brown impossible not at all
mayer in chicago arranged that while
anson was signing for this picture
the old substitution trick you know
as for the champion getting wise-not
a chance this advertisement here will
forestall that brown will come in an-
swer to it see well hire him in front
of anson-who never saw the gunner
in his life do you think he would be
suspicious of a tramp extra-man  what
if he does find out after he gets in the
ring it will be too late then

  by george thats good said hal-
lahan suddenly

  of course it is the stage is all set
now brown is waiting out there now
with the rest of the pork-and-beaners
heres his picture johnny the gun-
ners brother who is incidentally his
manager-sent it to me ive never met
them you know richards and mayer
have done all the work so far sweet-
looking baby isnt he

  a taffy-haired stenographer opened
the door mr anson is here she in-
formed the duo

  they went out into the waiting-room
gribble still clutching the newspaper
there were a score of men chiefly
prominent for bulging jaws and disfig-
ured features sitting about the ex-
ecutives ignored them and rushed to the
door where peter stood their greet-
ing was rather stickily effusive

  hallahan explained why the men were
waiting and intimated that he waited
on the champions approval before pick-
ing one of them out gribbles eyes
were roving about the waiting-room
and settled on a big red-faced chap
with rather prominent teeth    gun-
ner brown he knew

  you he said sharply whats
your name

  curran sir

  youre a fighter

  yes sir

  weight

  one hundred and ninety-five
good enough what do you think
of him anson

  the champion looked at him sharply
there was something familiar about
him    why yes he was the brother
of that chap who had been abusing the
girl at the boarding-house however
there was no use holding that against
him the fellow probably needed the
job

  oh i guess hell do said peter
he looks to be in top-notch physical
shape do you want to work with me
curran 

  the englishman gave him an evil


fight stories

glance then dropped his eyes yes
sir he said sullenly

two hours later a number of big
touring cars hummed swiftly out the
foothill road they contained the ac-
tors who were to participate in the pic-
ture for johnny hallahan did not intend
that the time should be wasted anson
thought it peculiar that they were going
on location for so long a time but ad-
mitting his ignorance of the devious
ways of directors said nothing

  their headquarters were half a dozen
cabins deep in the santa catalina hills
the motors took them as far as pos-
sible  then they continued  horseback
it was far enough from human habita-
tion and pernicious newspapers to satisfy
even leslie gribble there were to be
no messengers between film city and
the location on which they were work-
ing in order to prevent the slightest in-
formation from getting to ansons ears

  then johnny went to work he had
mapped out a stunt picture that kept
them on their toes-hair-raising runs
through the brush and over boulders
struggles on the very lip of the canyon
rescues from the icy waters of the
stream

  peter anson thoroughly enjoyed
every moment of it he had expected
to spend a lot of time in the studio
working under the glare of the cooper-
hewitt lights life in the open-the
exhilaration of strength-building effort
-and the spice of danger added a
piquant zest to existence time flew
and almost before he knew it the two
weeks were over

  the exhausting work had tired out
many of the stunt actors but it had not
injured anson in the least that both-
ered johnny hallahan he decided to
stage an affair that would send the
champion into the ring in no condition
to fight

  there was a steep path down the face
of the nearby canyon below it a swift
mountain stream hurdled over its rocky
bed swirling in deep pools and racing

over pebbly narrows only the soft
murmur of it came up mingled with the
thresh of willows and the elfin music of
insects the day before they returned
to film city johnny took the company
out there

  were going to try a run down the
face of the canyon he said peter
here will be in the lead fanning old
thunderbolt between the ears with the
butt of his gun you want an oblique
angle he added to the camera-man
and shoot low i dont want much
above his head when you get to that
point-indicating a rock marked with
chalk midway down the steep declivity-
pedroll rope old thunderbolt and
bring him to a stop foi heavens
sake get a little life into it we dont
want any make-overs

  peter anson climbed into the saddle
his heart beating not a fraction faster
in spite of the narrow and frightfully
steep trail that faced him

  ready action go snapped the
director anson touched thunderbolt
with his spurs and the stunt-pony
started lickety-split down the trail with
the posse pounding behind yelling and
firing  pedro the little mexican va
quero was in the lead circling his lariat
above iiis head when peter came
abreast of the marked stone the coil of
braided hair snaked out and dropped
around his shoulders it seemed to the
champion as though a mighty hand
reached out of nowhere lifted him from
the saddle and dashed him to the ground
sprawling  his back in the whirlwind
of dust ne saw the other actors sweep
by then pull up and ride back as
johnny yelled cut

  peter anson was bruised from neck
to heels and his left wrist was begin-
ning to swell ominously in his brief
experience in filmland he had learned to
take a fall as trick riders do but this
had been so unexpected that he came
to the ground all bunched up thun-
derbolt-not he-was to have been las-
soed he rose dizzily spitting out a
mouthful of sand and blood
framed



  the doctor with the outfit examined
him and found a sprained wrist in ad-
dition to a score of bruises johnny
hallahan was raving mad-or pretended
most admirably that he was

  the dumb greaser he shouted
id like to feed him to the squirrels
a dozen times i told him that it was
thunderbolt he was to rope and every
time he opened that silly mouth of his
and said si senor then he lays you
out fortunately were just about fin-
ished here anyway

  it is fortunate that i havent any
fights scheduled in the near future
said peter grimly if i had i would
be an ex-champion sure as shooting-
and i cant afford to lose the title yet a
while

  the director averted his eyes yes

it is lucky he said

while peter anson was in the
santa catalina hills on location
gribble carried out every detail of his
plan an arena that seated some ten
thousand people was built on the lot
of immortal players inc and on the
day of the fight it was packed with
sweating enthusiastic fight fans anson
was the favorite of course but the
flood of cash that appeared to back
gunner brown sliced the odds from two
to one to even money that in itself
aroused hectic interest something was
in the wind

  gribble prowled around uneasy as a
wet cat his fat face had lost its
wonted color and there were moments
when his hands trembled with nervous-
ness he felt morally certain of the
outcome but it was his spineless nature
to worry over every chance he took on
the other hand hallahan was as cool
and debonair as if only a trifle hinged
on the result

  youre sure everything is all right
johnny gribble asked for the twen-
tieth time if anything goes wrong
ill be wiped out

  the director puffed calmly at his
cigarette so will i-but nothing can

go wrong gunner brown is a fighter
who can give anson the battle of his
life even if peter was in pcrfect shape
just now our champion is in better con-
dition for the hospital than the ring
youve seen brown training besides
he has a grudge against anson peter
and the gunners brother had a scrap
the morning we left for the hills and
the englishman had all the worst
of it-broke his arm i believe when
peter knocked him down so the
gunner wants to clean peter for
purely personal reasons nothing can
go wrong

  anson drove up to the arena in
gribbles limousine his wrist was
heavily bandaged and taped and his
badiy bruised left arm was wrapped in
cloth he had suggested that the box-
ing scene be held up for a day or two
ilallahan countered with the plea of
financial necessity the company was
laboring under difficulties and it would
strain them to keep the enormous mob
of extra people any longer than was
absolutely necessary he pointed out
that the boxing scene would be no more
than a mild workout anyway so
peter always good natured agreed

  now he paused outside the arena
the immensity of it the enthusiasm of
the mob puzzled him and then in an
instant he understood that he had been
framed inside the stadium an op-
ponent was waiting for him  a
good one  doubt    gunner
brown 

  peter ansons lips tightened he
had promised not to fight that fellow
it would take the biggest sort of moral
courage to stand by his word in the face
of that crowd-but if gunner brown
was his opponent he would not fight
marigold held his promise only she
could release him from it and she was
three thousand miles away

  johnny hallahan came to the doo of
the limousine but he did not look di-
rectly at the champion

  who is this fellow i am to fight
asked peter


fight stories

  you picked him out yourself some
tramp scrapper

  i want to know hallahan do you
think that i am a blind fool i can see
that this isnt a moving-picture but the
stage setting for a real fight

  so feeling absolutely confident of the
outcome and knowing that it was only
a few minutes until peter would find
out the truth anyway the director told
him everything that had happened

  youre going to box gunner
brown he finished gribble has your
signed contract and if you welsh now
youll never fight again there is a big
enough purse to make it worth while
anyway

  not to make it worth my while
said anson quietly i promised not
to fight gunner brown-and im not
going to

  such a contingency had never oc-
curred to johnny hallahan he threat-
ened he pointed out that anson would
be irrevocably ruined if he refused
peter realized the truth of the assertion
but his promise to marigold was a bar-
rier that he refused to hurdle

  at that intensely interesting mo-
ment the moving-picture cow-puncher
whom anson had first seen on the steps
of johnny hallahans office rushed up
sweating profusely and out of breath

  ive been chasm you around like a
locoed cay use he panted heres a
telegram marked urgent important
rush an all the rest of it

   peter tore it open

  if you get the opportunity to fight
gunner brown do it i release you
from your promise-more am anxious
for you to get that bout dearest love

m arigold

  how do i know that this isnt part
of the frame-up asked peter in his
quiet voice

  the puncher grinned feebly i may
be dumber than a long-horned bull but

i	know some things i listened around
and heard about this frame-up-an two
or three other things-so i took the

liberty o sending a telegram to miss
havens you can trim this gunner-
pcrson go in and do it

  peter anson went into the ring his
lips thinned into a hard line he had
been tricked into fighting for his title
when he was in better condition for a
doctor than a crucial battle if he went
down to the canvas for ten seconds it
meant the end of his happy dreams he
wasnt going to lose if brawn and cour-
age could beat this mighty champion of
england

  when the bell rang for the first round
peter advanced to the center of the
ring he had mapped out his plan of
combat battered as he was it was im-
possible for him to sustain a long battle
he must end it quickly if at all

  his opponent circled around him left
fist pumping in and out anson hurled
himself forward and ripped into brown
like a madman the englishman cov-
ered up and retreated the mob
howled for peter was the favorite and
the super-cautious tactics of the in-
vader delighted them

  though able to hit only with his right
hand anson made that fist count he
herded the gunner into a corner and
belted away like a madman the title
was forgotten he was fighting for his
future-for marigolds happiness

  the gunner huddled up his shoul-
ders wrapped his arms about his body
and jaw and sought to weather the
storm as a championship fight it was
a farce-not the farce that gribble and
hallahan had expected-but exactly the
reverse the crowd howled its execra-
tions on the vaunted fighting machine
from england

  the end came twenty seconds from
the end of the round brown sought
to slip out of the corner and essay a
little footwork peter nailed him with
a savage hook to the jaw that threw the
gunner back on his heels the britons
eves glazed one arm jerked up in a
futile gesture of defense then peter
caught him with a savage blow that sent
him quivering to the floor
framed



  there was no need for the referees
count had each second been a min-
ute long gunner brown would have
been unable to drag himself to his feet

ten minutes later the moving-pic-
ture cowboy accompanied peter
anson into the latters dressing-
room

  i cant understand it mused the
champion caressing his sprained wrist
the gunner should have been able to
trim me under these conditions

  the cowboy chuckled he might
have-but you see it wasnt gunner
brown you fought

  what

  listen i got this story right re-
member the guy you licked at your
boardin house the mornin you re-
ported to hallahan that was gun-
ner brown himself who had followed
you there to keep a line on you he

busted his wrist when he fell an so
far as he was concerned the scrap was
off but brother nat saw a chance to
clean up without hurtin the gunners
fighting reputation he took the eng-
lish champs place himself easy enough
wasnt it nobody knew em and the
fight was staged too quick for any
european sportsmen to get over nat
collected the money-gave the story
clearin his brother to the newspapers-
an hiked for a train east youre all
set now peter-boy i wired from the
ringside for miss havens to come out
here right away after youre married
she can tell you that she is sorry for
tryin to keep her stepb-other from
gettin trimmed for that matter you
can take him on when your wrist is
better-an eat up ted richards quar-
ter of a million everythings fine
aint it

  peter admitted that everything was

the old man in cleveland

kid broad had a rich and exciting career the kid wasnt handsome and he
wasnt clever but he could put up a rattling good fight any time he was
matched with a hard hitter one night-oh an awfully hard hitter

 he belts me one on the jaw in the second round see said the kid down i
 went scratching canvas i rolled over an said to meself get up kid the old
 man in cleveland  read about this in the paper to-morrow an i got up

   in the third he lands another one and while im listenin to the referee i said
 dont forget the old man in cleveland hell read about this

 durin the next couple o rounds im down half a dozen times an each time i
 says you dont wtant the old man in cleveland to find out that you was stopped
 then in the sixth this bozo lets one go from his heels and i didnt know nothin
 until i heard eight and found meself on me back everything was dark and
 wobbly the old jaw felt like a mule had been beatin tattoo on it wit his hoofs

   so i just rolled over and said i dont care what the old man reads he takes
 too many papers anyway

   an i stayed down

a rock-em and sock-em fighter

bobby barrett has been knocked out fourteen times but even up to
the day he quit the ring was a great drawing card on the strength
of victories over johnny mealey and oakland jimmy duffy he was rushed
along too fast for his strength and experience-an error committed all too
frequently in the fight game when just a raw kid he fought lew tendler
charley white and other leaders in their difficult profession

   barrett was a caddie-master at the aronomink golf club in philadelphia
before taking seriously to the ring his brick red hair was a familiar sight
to the club members and later became a flaming beacon to the fans who
loved a rock-em and sock-em sure-enough fighter for ten years he stuck
to the fighting game meeting with more reverses than successes but always
packing em in when he fought

   there never was a better illustration of the power of the punch tuar this
same bobby barrett he never learned to box never acquired the skill
which might have put him on the top of the heap but the crowds came
just the same because they knew the odds were all in favor of a knockout
one way or the other they knew barrett would tear in with all he had
they knew he would fight furiously and dramatically to get over one of his
famous round-house punches and they knew that if one of those punches
landed his opponent would take the count

   even though the odds were against its landing the possibility was there
and that possibility alone tinged young bobby barrett with a glamor and
color that made him the box-office attraction he was

stories

shoot that left

  george bruce author of shoot that
left the novel in this issue of fight
stories has an interesting background
on which to draw for his yarns  the
prize ring he says

  shoot that left is the result of my
experience as newspaper man covering sport-
ing events for one of the largest newspaper
syndicates in the country sitting ringside
night after night at star bouts soaking up
the atmosphere of the ring knowing the
fighters the heart-breaking unending toil that
is the lot of every pugilist seems to give one
a different slant on the whole game from the
slant it brings to the fan-the man who
pays his money at the gate and takes his
choice

  ive learned how much a punch can hurt
how much heart it takes to stand up under
the fire of a superior man and keep boring
in for more i know what hanging arms and
heaving chest mean to a pugilist in the way of
agony-and many times as i have sat in a
wooden chair looking up at a game stand
by a bor who refuses to dog it ive thanked
my lucky stars that my part of the program
was to rap a typewriter for the edification of
the general public rather than take a chance
of getting my own jaw rapped by being one
of the parties to the rough house inside the
ropes

  its plenty easy for a sporting writer to
come out the next day and knock one of the
contestants had the same sporting writer
been in the ring and taken a few of the
knocks himself his viewpoint would have
undergone a serious change

  shoot that left is a story of the ring
it is a story that lives in the mind and heart
and memory of every boxer it is his at-
mosphere and his world the incidents are
all actual facts-insofar as the attempt of
spike otoole and sailor madden to frame
buster martin through the mediumship of a
girl its done-often still the best laid
plans of mice and men-

  i hope all you resin rubbers will like this
yarn if it strikes home id like to know
about it-it means that more will follow

george bruce

jack byrne writes-

jack byrne who wrote breed
of champions that rattling good
yarn of amateur boxing in the current
issue relates below a little incident that
provided the theme for his story

  breed of champions is based on some-
thing that happened to me and is still very
real in my memory it is based on the first
the neutral corner



time that i admitted to myself that i was
afraid

  my kid idols were two uncles of mine one
was heavyweight champion at his college the
other was champion on his fleet i thought
they were super-men invinciblc and i was
mighty proud to be able to say they were re-
lated to me

  then one summer one of them came up
to spend a couple of weeks with us he
brought footballs and baseballs and all sorts
of sporting equipment with him and he used
to spend most of his time playing around
with the kids in the neighborhood one day
he produced his gloves and decided wed have
some boxing lessons

  what happened is much the same as the
story he socked me one while we were
sparring and i took a quick dive and i
knew that he knew i was afraid to take it
so next day i did the only thing possible to
show him i wasnt a quitter

  i managed to get some of the other kids
sparring and then i boldly offered to scrap
a ittle with a chap who was plenty bigger
well i look quite a beating but when my
uncle stopped it i was still piling in there
and asking for it and i would have taken
a couple more beatings just to hear him tell
me again that he understood

  i have always been interested in amateur
boxing because to my notion it is the finest
part of the fight game its clean and whole-
some and it builds men if you want to see
a real scrap with nothing in the bag just hie
yourself to the next series of amateur bouts
that hit town youll find action and thrills
-and maybe laughs-that you cant get any-
where else

                       jack byrne

the busiest fighters

who among the great array of
fighters from time immemorial
has fought the most battles win lose
or draw perhaps our readers have
some little-known information on this
subject if so send it in it is gener-
ally known that abe the newsboy
claimed to have engaged in more than
a thousand combats but abe wrestled
as much as he fought and there are no
conclusive records at hand to prove his
contention

 kid beebe who fought for many
years and met some of the best feather-
weights in the game seems to have been
among the worlds busiest fistmen

  here is a list of stars who engaged
in more than two hundred fights each

                                      fights

gameness

  they say the difference between a
game man and a quitter shows when
they are knocked down the game man
gets up the quitter stays on the floor

  this is not entirely true sometimes
it is a question of ability to assimilate
a punch rather than of courage bom-
badier wells the englishman was as
game as any one but he could be
knocked out easily he just didnt have
the resistance joe choynski with a
heart like a lion felt a strong punch so
much in his legs that he could not con-
trol them

 both wells and choynski were as
game as joe grim and joe jeannette
yet grim was knocked down thirteen
times in a six-round bout with bob
fitzsimmons and rose every time jean-

ette was dropped thirty-two times in a
finish fight with sam mcvey but came
along to win out

  no one could question the courage of
these men but it must be remembered
that they had abnormal strength and
vitality which wells and choynski did
not have so the next time you see a
man go down on the floor and stay
there dont jump to conclusions and
question his gameness he may want to
get up and be unable to do so

levinsky comes back

the comeback of battling levinsky
is one of the most interesting and
dramatic features of the past years ring
history levinsky a smart young man
some time ago revived the light-heavy-
weight title and took it for his own
he lost it to georges carpentier before
the frenchman met jack dempsey and
after losing a fifteen-round decision to
gene tunney in  he retired from
the game

  about a year ago levinsky became
convinced that he could outpoint most
of therugged sluggers he saw in the
ring he started out again and has been
surprisingly successful levinsky is
forty years old but clean living and
proper training have kept his body in
perfect condition

  he defeated matt adgie a youth
who was known and feared for his
punch and then went ten fast rounds
with billy stribling  and though strib-
ling had run up a string of knockouts
he was unable even to knock the ancient
mariner down another of levinskys
surprises was in fighting a draw with
tiny roebuck a young giant twenty
years his junior and fifty-seven pounds
heavier

  it just goes to show that the man who
takes care of himself intelligently can
retain his vitality and skill past the time
when athletic ability is supposed to fade
the neutral corner



sams wallop

some of the old-timers opinions of
other old-timers make interesting
reading for example gunboat smith
whose occipital punch nearly ruined
jack dempsey in the early stages of the
maulers career believes that sam
langford was one of the most devastat-
ing hitters of all time

  sam was the greatest puncher i ever
saw says smith for a week after
my first bout with him i could hang
my hat on the side of my head there
were so many lumps i didnt need a
collar button either for langford
raised one on the back of my neck

  he hit me on the top of the head
so hard that he knocked my tights clear
up to my chin no kiddin if he was
around today and as good as he was then
they wouldnt have to look for any logi-
cal contender hed be it

 whims of fighting men

  eddie burnbrook who won the army
welterweight championship some years
ago and became known as one of the
hardest punching men of his weight
when he turned professional is a curi-
ous soul

  eddie has scored more knockouts
than almost any other man in the game
he hasnt the hardest chin in the world
and has been beaten more than once
himself but no one ever questioned his
courage

  his favorite pastime is crocheting
no kidding this slugging prize-
fighter would rather crochet something
like a bed-spread than do anything else
in his spare time his home is full of
doilies and centerpieces and what-nots
that he made himself

  no one can call him a sissy though
hes far too hard-boiled for that but
he is as amazingly skilful with the
needle as a painter with his brushes
and is rather proud of his deftness

the unluckiest fighters

 tvld all you statisticians know that
 spencer gardner has lost more
 decisions than any other fighter in the
 game  he had  verdicts charged
 against him though in this he is but
 little ahead of the english feather-
 weight freddy jacks who lost  ref-
 erees decisions

interesting comparative figures in the
matter of lost decisions does not in-
