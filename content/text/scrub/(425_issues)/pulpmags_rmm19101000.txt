our fourth mile-post

the train-sheets of our successful run of the past year which has ended
without a hot box or a loose joint-and the old hog is panting
for the next division our string of cars is as new as the
day it left the shop the con has given the high-
ball-she is off again and hot for the hill

by the editor

ompleting his first four years
of continuous service no mat-
ter how indifferently it may
appeal to the average layman
as merely a certain measure of
time is to the railroader a
period replete with much significance be-
cause it tells unerringly whether success or
failure has attended his effort in his chosen
line it is the time associated with the du-
ration of all apprenticeships to the many and
varied trades - machinists boiler - makers
molders pattern-makers and others-which
necessity through development has gradual-
ly incorporated into the conduct of the iron
trail it represents the time which a brake-
man must serve before running his own
train and serves to define the length of a
firemans endeavor before the coveted posi-
tion is attained on the right side of the cab

  to successfully round up these four years
is to pass from the experimental to the pos-
sible stage-from chimera to reality and
because fact has supplanted fancy a tangi-
ble basis is evolved for general groundwork
in the future the presentation of an appren-
ticeship certificate by the master mechanic
to an embryo machinist implies the conces-
 rr

sion on thepart of the railroad company that
the recipient has learned his business-or
at least if he has not thoroughly learned it
he is still safe to be entrusted with its con-
duct it means that while before the ap-
prentice had largely speculation for a basis
he is now familiar with what is wanted and
it is up to him to apply his lessons

  the railroad mans magazine which
with this number passes its fourth mile-
stone is impressed by the mark which the
above lapse of time affords to its own his-
tory it points with pride to the fact that
it too has served an apprenticeship-a four-
year apprenticeship in which it has tried to
learn the trade of appreciating just what its
readers want between its covers

  we say that it has tried to do this because
in the stirring business which it chronicles
where something new or progressive crops out
every day it would be absurd to assert that
it inis thoroughly learned its trade as yet
and this notwithstanding the grateful fact
that you boys have given u our apprentice-
ship certificate on approval in the shape of a
patronage which in magnitude has probably
never before fallen to the lot of a magazine
just four years old


the railroad maxs magazine

author of many articles of technical value

including the rogers group for
beginners

photograph by kemp paterson atevj jersey

  when this magazine was founded the field
defined by its name was recognized as prac-
tically limitless and past experience had well
indicated the appreciation among all classes
of magazine readers for a good railroad story

  it was realized that the very best of these
were yet to be unearthed - that they were
scattered throughout the length and breadth
of the land in lonely signal-towers terminal-
yards office-buildings and bustling round-
houses-and that every ramification of the
railroad no matter how apparently insignifi-
cant embodied some local incident which
with the proper treatment must be of uni-
versal interest

  disregarding pure fiction for the moment
we believe that the fund of true stories is in-
exhaustible we refer to the stories of rail-
road life that are heard after the days work
is done but which so seldom see print be-
cause the narrators have neither the time in-

clination nor possibly the training it was
to secure these and the associated features
which combine in the real drama of the road
that gilson willets was put on the trail in
october  it was an assignment dar-
ing in conception as the magazine was then
an unknown and untried quantity it was
the first time that a magazine writer had ever
gone among railroad men for stories

  since his first trip over the union pacific
and part of the southern pacific mr wil-
lets has made three similar journeys he
has traveled thirty-six thousand miles on the
railroads of this country more than enough
to encircle the globe he has written from
the last eastern extremity at cape cod
through the northern boundary via the great
lakes and chicago to puget sound and
from los angeles and the desert country
through the south to the national capital he
secured some of the best stories of human

nature daring heroism love comedy and
tragedy that were ever published-and the
railroad embodies all these elements of life

  we have mentioned mr willets thus
prominently because more than any man we
know he has unearthed the human side of
cur great railroads he possesses the justly
envied faculty of making friends he knows
how to get a story and-he knows how to tell
it his future work in this connection will
no doubt be lighter than in the past because
through the slogan watch for willets
the railroad men are always ready to meet
him they have seen and enjoyed the fruits
of his earlier trips they understand his mis-
sion and they know that their confidence
has not been misplaced

  one of our most popular features has been
the true story series we asked your help
to make these stories possible as we believed
and still believe that everv incumbent of a

as interesting as they are accurate

railroad position no matter how humble he
may be can recall a personal experience or
an incident out of the ordinary which would
make splendid reading because it is true

  the only stipulation was that it must be
authentic and proof against any question
which we might ask the railroad company or
the persons written about that the re-
sponse has been noble is evinced by the fact
that this october  issue contains true
story no -forty-nine stories of unusual
interest which we venture to say would
have remained largely untold had it not been
for the railroad mans magazine and
there are hundreds more which have never
come to our office but the good ones will
come

- mr willetss campaigns and the true
story series effectually portrayed the human
interest side of the railroad but they have


the railroad wans magazine

not dimmed our fiction-our stories of rail-
road life in all its phases from the frozen
fingers of the humblest  ham  to the finan-
cial concerns of the president

  after the first number appeared we were
in receipt of many letters in which we were
besieged with many requests for real rail-
road fiction-not true stories or even stories
based on fact but for the simon-pure article
without which no magazine can possibly ex-
ist

  engineers wrote us for fiction stories of
their always romantic profession the fire-
man wished his progressive calling to be ex-
ploited telegraph operators clamored for a
recognition of their important end of it and
even the baggage-smasher of humorous fancy
was averse to being forgotten

  we called on old and tried writers and
have developed many new ones to supply us
with our fiction cy warman j r staf-
ford and  h richardson have sat on the

right side of the cab in their day augustus
wittfield he of the monk hausen and car-
lock bjones yarns is a philadelphia printer
and never wrote before this magazine in-
spired him john c russell that nomadic
soldier of fortune robert fulkerson hoff-
man who has also served as a railroad man
charles wesley sanders c w beels rob-
ert f creel frank condon horace h herr
katharine eggleston and the others who we
do not slight bv omitting their names have
furnished us with some of the most readable
stories ever given to the american public in
which the life and atmosphere of the railroad
man have been depicted with unerring touch-
es and when it comes to humor it must be
a weak-minded vinegar-blooded man who
cant chuckle till he aches over the honk and
horace stories by emmet f harte

  these writers have created a new school
in story-telling which we will term the fiction
in story-telling which we will term the fic-
tion of the railroad the creations of these
writers although often broadly drawn as
fictitious characters must be under certain
treatment were nevertheless of distinctively
human aspect they reminded one of the
pleasanter side of business and they were the
fellows you liked to meet after the day was
in no matter what their peculiarities may
have been

  the short story is a vital problem in the
making of any magazine but it has been a
particularly hard task in connection with this
publication due to the fact that its audience
is naturally the most critical in the world

  our fiction readers are active men of the
rail who want good enlivening stories of
their various occupations but they are quick
to resent a technical inaccuracy

  the old-school fiction wherein the lever
is reversed and the eagle eye blows for
brakes could have no place in the rail-
road mans magazine it would simply
imply that the book would be thrown aside in
pardonable disgust regardless of the literary
excellence of the effort

  we want to remind you of the many and
varied serials with which you have been en-
tertained for these at least we have 
apology to offer and  recriminations for
ourselves william s wright john wells-
icy sanders george van schakk j aubrey
tyson and horace herr have furnished
some thrilling yarns-and they are going to
furnish some more

  some of them may not have possessed the
distinctive flavor of the railroad but the
majority were connected therewith and it

is pleasing to recall that many have survived
in the more enduring book-form since you
first made their acquaintance in these pages
we have been truly fortunate in this rather
elaborate form of fiction in securing the
work of trained writers who possess the ad-
ditional qualification of being sufficiently
versed in the basic principles of railroading
to present the incidents with realism and
fidelity to fact

  however it was never intended to make
the railroad mans magazine a mere
story-book any more than to have it strictly
informative and technical we knew long
before october  that railroads in gen-
eral had been but lightly touched upon in
the special article the basis of which is
necessarily informative and that employees
of all grades were eagerly awaiting the his-
tory of the great american railroads

  that is why we started with the very first
number to tell you the real facts of the build-
ers lives of their struggles during the for-
mation of these enduring monuments to su-
perhuman endeavor and of the romance that
is associated with enterprises so great and so
diversified

  space limitations of this talk forbid more
than a mention of how thoroughly the maga-
zine has covered this ground in the past four
years but it is no more than fair to the ef-
forts of our contributors and our own as
well to recall the great american train-
robberies series which ran through fourteen
numbers the histories of the railroads in
which you read the history of the famous old
erie with its mosaic of ever-changing ad-
ministrations of the baltimore and ohio
the real pioneer of the trunk-lines and of
the great pennsylvania which so proudly
lays claim to be the standard railroad of
america 

  other stories in this entertaining series
told you how the union pacific united the
ends of the continent how the santa fe
conquered the desert of the varied career of
the new york central and of the titanic
struggle which pushed the canadian pa-
cific from ocean to ocean

  these articles which subsequently ap-
peared in book-form under the title when
railroads were new were written by c f
carter who has contributed many additional
articles of historical and biographical im-
portance in the latter connection we wish
to particularly specify mr carters series
entitled men who have made travel
safe undoubtedly the most important ad-
dition to the railroad literature of the coun-

try which had been presented up to that time
in its component parts the gamut was run
from ross winans the baltimore locomo-
tive-builder and probably the most pictur-
esque character in the annals of the business
to plimmon h dudley the inventor of the
modern steel rail

  in relating the researches and achieve-
ments of these remarkable men and of bald-
win westinghouse pullman and many oth-
ers whose names are known all over the
world mr carter certainly unearthed a
wealth of unsuspected and hitherto unpub-
lished reminiscence biography lost its dul-
ness through the clever recital of interesting
and well-told stories of the men who made
railroading possible and if your pleasure in
reading them equaled ours we are repaid
with the author for the labor of their prepa-
ration and presentation

the railroad mans magazine

iv came to us that the railroad mans
magazine has covered an unusually wide
field in telling of prominent railroad men
and their doings the men at the top
related the stories of the presidents and
through the  getting off the sidings  you
were kept well informed regarding the pro-
gressive movements of the lesser lights

  the end is-not yet because the magazine

he relates with facile pen the quaint
doings of that joy-dispensing pair
honk and horace

proposes to make a brief mention of at least
every man of authority on the railroad of
his present position what he has done and
maybe of the little peculiarities which asso-
ciate with the majority who have won suc-
cess in this exacting business we cannot say
just what form this presentation will assume
but it is one of the good things to come

  a large majority of our readers are prac-
tical men and with the friendliness which
so soon became established between us on
the congenial environment of the editorial

carpet they began to refer to their favor-
ite monthly for the solution of many little
problems which daily confronted them in
their work at hand thus the prominent de-
partment  by the light of the lantern
came into being no doubt the most popular
feature ever incorporated in a magazine

  in the november  number the invi-
tation was extended to railroad men in any
capacity to ask us in this announce-
ment we did not claim that the answers
would be infallible as it was well realized
that the varied constituency of the new de-
partment would necessarily present many
hard nuts to crack but our confidence was
strong in the railroad man of long expe-
rience whom we engaged to  swing our lan-
tern and the outcome was awaited without
misgiving

  the rapid growth of this venture in in-
trinsic worth as well as volume needs no
comment here we would be pleased to
quote from a portion of the myriad letters
which the editor has received in the past
three years commending the conciseness and
thoroughness of the replies and thanking us
for the sound and practical advice which the
editor of the lantern has been so fre-
quently called upon to give

  the popularity of this now strongly es-
tablished department has been no unimpor-
tant factor in the success of the railroad
mans magazine it has served in the val-
ued capacity of continually attracting new
and retaining old friends and last but not
least it has endowed the magazine with a
prestige of which we are mighty proud

  although you may not have recognized
the fact the lantern department for a long
time has traveled hand in hand with another
particularly prominent department which
we have called the  self-help  feature or
properly  help for men who help them-
selves this and the lantern in the ag-
gregate really constitute our real claim for
technical recognition and the history of the
self-help feature is of such interest that we
feel impelled to tell you about it

  the considerations which brought it into
being were of mature deliberation we de-
sired to add to our many features another in
which the primary object would be to de-
scribe the inner workings of tlie railroad
world for instance we aspired to take in
detail the work of a fireman and that of his
more exalted confrereon the other side of the
cab we wanted to tell you how a locomotive
is built and of the pulse which throbs in its
vitals
our fourth mile-tost



  we did not propose to stop there either
because the track the telegraph and many
other ends were just as important and called
for equal recognition in their turn it was
impossible in view of our varied clientele
to relate the story of one without the other
and so long as we have introduced this sub-
ject let us see how we have measured up
to it 

  our first story in  help for men who
help themselves appeared in the august
 issue it was entitled the making
of an engine and was written by robert
h rogers who at that time held the posi-
tion of master mechanic on the new york
new haven and hartford railroad at bos-
ton massachusetts

  mr rogers accompanied this story by two
others- how a locomotive-boiler works
and the inside history of a locomotive
we were impressed by the evident mastery
of the writer over his subjects and no doubt
the ease of style and absence of stiffness
which characterized their portrayal-fea-
tures which carry a particular appeal to the
trained editor-were active in dictating our
subsequent attitude and this was to besiege
mr rogers for more articles

  to be entirely candid with you-which
in fact is the real object of this writing-we
thought that so long as we had secured thus
opportunely three acceptable offerings of the
very goods which we knew you wanted they
might form the basis of a permanent feature
of course it was problematical at that time
whether additional material of equal force
and appeal could be readily secured but as
the saying goes on the road we  took the
chance the result quite clearly indicates
that the  help for men who help them-
selves  has been a valued asset

  the writers who contribute to this particu-
lar feature must necessarily possess qualifi-
cations somewhat unique in the first place
they must have an intimate personal knowl-
edge of what they are writing about and
second - which to many is the hardest
requisite-they must know how to write ac-
ceptably what they have to say

  we feel that these difficult requirements
this unique combination of talent has been
well realized in the articles by arno dosch
peter mulligan charlton c andrews c f
carter and others which have regularly ap-
peared in the self-help series and of which
some furdier mention will be made

  mr rogers has written many articles for
this magazine from an educational stand-
point and furthermore from the standpoint

which knows whereof it speaks he has the
honor among our contributors of presenting
the first self-help story we regard with
particular significance his work during the
year just passed in our history-the series
-ihich appeared from april to august 
wherein the progress of a neophyte in the
mechanical department of a railroad was
traced from the humble apprentices berth

he has pictured in many short stories the
psychological side of the railroad
mans life

to the proud eminence occupied by the su-
perintendent of motive power

  these articles were enriched with added
interest through the general knowledge that
mr rogers has himself filled every position
from cub to master mechanic it was not
necessary in his delineation to strain for
words or for effect because - as we have
often said-a true story largely tells itself
we regard the  rogers group  as the most
valuable series from an informative stand-
point that we have printed


the railroad mans magazine

  perhaps you are wondering by this time
what was meant when we said that the
help for men who help themselves and
the lantern department traveled hand in
hand it was simply because questions sub-
mitted to the lantern from time to time im-
pressed us as being worthy of elaboration in
the self-help feature for instance those
of you who are lantern readers know that
for quite a long period we were besieged with
queries as to whether the steam-locomotive
was doomed to be supplanted by its electric
rival this induced the preparation by mr
rogers for the september number of  why
the steam-locomotive vill stay and simi-
lar queries regarding the walschaert valve-
gear resulted in the matter being thoroughly
covered in a special article which will appear
in november

  thus you will see that you have had quite

 who wrote the successful series the let-
 ters ok an old railroad man and his son

a voice in the selection of articles which have
appeared in the self-help series

  a subject of general interest which has
been featured in this department wa 
electricity for telegraphers by j h
gingrich which continued through three
numbers and which we believe constituted
the most lucid explanation of the telegraph in
general which has ever appeared in print

  another valuable series by charlton c
andrews was on the actual building and
maintenance of the railroad which appeared
under the following heads surveying for
a railroad  building a railroad track
keeping a railroad track in order
and the men who handle the engines

  these - articles and many others which
limited space prevents our mentioning have
appeared in thirty-six numbers of the maga-
zine and in all probability contained the
very information in compiled form which
you had been awaiting for years
our fourth mile-post



  in september and october  mr
rogers told you how a locomotive-boiler
works and how the locomotive is con-
structed in february  john elfreth
watkins followed with a graphic description
of the actual building and iothe next num-
ber c t rommel described the intricate
process through which its pulse is felt the
ever-exciting work performed by real heroes
from their perilous perch over the throbbing
cylinders while the engine is  doing her
mile

  it is the story of speed

  this series has contained the story of the
block system it has explained how train or-
ders are made and has discussed the more
intricate problems of getting at the truth
about the rolling-stock indeed so broad has
been its scope from a practical standpoint
that notwithstanding our own familiarity
with the self-help department we are

amazed at the wealth and diversity of ma-
terial which has been presented

  it is our intention to continue covering
every important part of the railroad and the
industrial fields contributor- thereto so
fully that those who follow the magazine
closely will have as perfect a knowledge of
each department appliance and operation as
it is possible to secure without actual prac-
tical experience the primary object of the
 help for men who help themselves  is
to add to the knowledge and consequent
value and efficiency of the railroad workers
who are anxious to climb to higher grades
but the articles must still be of tremendous
value to all  outsiders  who are possessed
of an ordinarily healthy curiosity about rail-
road matters

  the man who wants to know because he
likes the sensation of knowledge will be well
repaid by scanning this department and our
special articles closely in the future there

is an unlimited field ahead and aldiough
much has been accomplished we have in
reality only started

  for those who find relaxation in a study
more intricate than above described-that of
human nature-it has been here for you to
delve into through the inimitable  observa-
tions of a country station-agent we trust
that this pleasing philosopher will remain
with us for some time because j e smith
has done more than write merely humorous
stories around his profession he is the sage
of the station-house

  his clever work which has been embodied
in many numbers of the magazine forms in
its entirety what is really a railroad classic
the quaint humor keen perception and
knowledge of humanity reflected in every
phase of these observations carries an appeal
so unique that it knows no particular cli-
entele it makes no difference what your
position in life may be either on or off the
railroad you would be lacking in that which
makes the whole world akin if you did not
enjoy mr smiths observations

  so much for the more important achieve-
ments of the railroad mans magazine
during the four years it has been learning its
trade and qualifying for a more active field
of usefulness in the future if there has been
undue dilation in this little history it is be-
cause we are truly proud of what has been
accomplished and in this pleasant retrospect
we wanted particularly to tell of the difficul-
ties which have beset the way of the many
hard battles we have fought to raise this
magazine to a popular plane and which
with your assistance we have won we are

thankful for the kind tolerance which you
extended during the period of our earlier ef-
forts and for the well-meaning criticisms
which you offered before we began to hit
up our gait we have a kindly thought
too that probably no magazine ever existed
where editors contributors and readers have
met on so agreeable a footing

  a department of the magazine which has
given us a great deal of pleasure is our own
little corner the carpet here is where
we talk with the boys at close range where
we tell our troubles and listen to theirs it
is our corner in the roundhouse our meeting-
place while waiting for the call-boy or the
train orders in this department we have
published many famous old railroad poems
we have gone to considerable trouble to dig
up some of them and others have been con-
tributed by our readers we are proud of
our collection of old railroad poems for they
are filled with the fire of heroism and courage
as well as the quality of human kindness

  that we have pleased the women folk is
readily attested by the volume of letters re-
ceived from the wives the daughters and the
sweethearts of the boys they like the maga-
zine because it pictures the lives of the men
in whom they are most interested

  we believed in the success of the rail-
road mans magazine from the start and
contributors artists and editors have worked 
shoulder to shoulder toward this realization

  the magazine passes into its fifth year se-
cure in its ability to do greater things than
those which have marked its past we thank
you boys for your kind support may you
never put the arm against us

 fifth avenue new york n y
the days run

by robert fulkerson hoffman

 the simple story of some everyday folk
 who do their work well and seek no glory

die world loves a lover twit-
tered a little woman who
stood with her friends just
below the cab-window she
set her hat straighter on her
head she believed and pat-
ted her back hair until it suited her imagina-
tion meanwhile smiling benignly after a
young couple who were self-consciously ma-
king their way down the platform they
appeared to be embarking upon a life ad-
venture by way of john labenburgs train

  the little group beneath the cab-window
dissolved into the hurrying throngs in the big
train-shed and if the repetition of the old
saw-which perhaps holds more of jingle
than of truth-made any impression upon
johns faculties he gave no outward sign

  true a brighter gleam may have lighted
the old mans eyes for an instant as he con-
tinued to look back along the train but he
took no more notice of the speaker than of
the hundreds of others who were part of the
animated scene

  labenburg in some respects was disap-
pointing as a locomotive engineer but in
reality there are many labenburgs that
is to say he was not down on the platform
before a group of admiring passengers doing
unnecessary oilings or feeling the driving-
axle centers with the back of his hand to
learn if they had run hot when he knew that
the engine had been standing in the round-
house for the last ten hours nor was he
loosening needle-feeds in the oil-cups so he
might look profoundly at them and tighten
them up again when in the beginning they
were all right and just as they should be

  in short john never made a play to the
grand stand in his life and would not have
known how to go about it he made most of
his preparations at the roundhouse

  when he got the signal he was watching

for he withdrew his calm-eyed old visage
into the cab and with an after-dinner sigh
dropped his hand caressingly upon the brake-
valve and released the brakes

  he looked out again for the answering
signal from the far end of the dusky train-
shed it came when he settled comfort-
ably upon his cushion his young fireman
was fuming about a leaking flue and had
just succeeded in kicking the fire-door shut
in a way that did not at all comport with his
good-natured face

  billy did you hear what the little lady
said of you   queried labenburg

  not about me said stalwart billy with
emphasis i can improve upon it though

	all the world kicks a kicker -or ought to
if that man at the roundhouse would quit
kicking and calk flues we could do better on
this run and less coal would be charged
against us

  dont kick billy counseled labenburg
with much gravity  we do pretty well
sometimes

  billy grinned guiltily and climbed upon
his seat-box to wait for the starting signal
when they got it and the shrill treble of the
little air-whistle in the cab died away laben-
burg opened the throttle as gently as one
might draw upon a softly-opened door and
as gently the engine at first responded

  there is a moment that is dear to the
heart of an engineer and yet it is one in
which the engine to the inexperienced on-
looker seems to fail of its promise of strength
it is that moment in which the eye of the
man in the cab is fixed upon the floor or the
earth at the side of the track and the for-
ward movement of the engine is so slight
that only that view will reveal it to him it
is the actual beginning of the days run

  they drew out through the wide-arching
mouth of the train-shed into the afternoon


the railroad mans magazine

sun and crossed from lead to lead down
through the teeming city yard curving his
able body above the clacking reverse lever
labenburg drew its resisting length up for
quicker speed and latched it safe and high
in the quadrant

  joy and hope despair and failure young
life and the quiet dead a magistrate late
from his ermine and a madman bound the
wealth of a kingdom in golden bars in the
express car only a cars length from the
cluttered possessions of a party of bewildered
immigrants all of these trailed in the lee
of the big engine all of them to him
were the train it was his to move them
swift and sure to deliver them up where
desired or at the farthest at the station one
hundred and fifty miles across the prairie
that station differed to him from all other
stations-because it was home

  the city fell behind like a swiftly
rolled canvas of neutral tints and they curved
around the southern shore of lake michi-
gan where surf-caps rolled white upon the
tawny beach and seemed to fall away broken-
ly among the sand pines

  a touch of the hand on the brake-valve
now and then to steady the long line of
coaches upon the curves the expiring sigh of
the release upon the tangent the momentary
stammering of the exhaust while a yielding
but sure grip reset the fighting reverse lever
the firm almost imperceptible play of the
hand upon the throttle the quickening speed
again the grinding restraint upon the smooth-
running wheels until the signal-arms beck-
oned them onward

  these were the animating forces that con-
trolled the fate of the hurrying cavalcade of
wheels with its motley burden of life and
the steady brain and eye and hand of laben-
burg played upon them as confidently as a
trained hand plays upon a well-strung harp

  the run was on and he was composedly a
part of it as silent serene and alone as
though in the heart of a forest ruled by
the primal laws of compensation in nature
his mind was instinctively working its own
economies

  an otherwise unbearable physical hurt
brings numbness that is near to physical com-
fort a crushing mental shock often gives a
mental cjuiet like that of deep peace an ac-
customed tumultuous world of sound eventu-
ally gives mental concentration that sharpens
every faculty gives alertness for the hearing
and sight of the unusual and leaves the mind
free to deal chiefly with that

  thus labenburg ran placidly on reading

signals - home and distant distinct and
clear-and billy worked methodically on the
deck rejoicing in the decreasing leak and
finding anew that trouble is sometimes worse
in the offing than when it comes nearer

   towns and hamlets arose out of the beau-
tiful flats of the prairie took on a momen-
tary importance and slowly sunk into the
low distance behind the flying train the
bell sang its musical crooning note and the
whistle droned across the wide spaces where
no hill sent back its voice and the smiling
land received them with a wide-ung wel-
come as in days gone and with happy prom-
ise for the days to come

  once toward evening a galloping horse
attached to a wildly rocking buggy raced up
a country lane between the green hedges to
contest with the engine for the moment of
crossing the space between them narrowed
closer and closer until a flying curtain
waved like a victorious banner from the
rear of the outfit after it had safely won
the crossing by an instants lead the occu-
pant was unaware that the little comedy
would have been a thing for his friend to
wee over but for labenburgs slight move-
ment at the brake-valve

   when the train stopped at a village that
boasted the name of  victory  on its small
station-board a little company awaited the
home-coming of the silent passenger in the
baggage-car with bared heads they walked
haltingly under the weight which the train
gave up to them and sliding it reverently
into the waiting mud-stained spring-wagon
by the track they placed a seat across it and
thus rode away with the great citys contri-
bution to the quiet little churchyard

   in silence labenburg and billy watched
the speaking scene and when they started
on again the hand upon the throttle drew it
open with a kindly touch the bell under
billys steady hand seemed to sound a slower
note and the mournful chime of the whistle
across all of that broad country seemed to
bear a deeper significance

  but the extra minutes used in the stop
were to be regained and labenburg went
calmly about it touching adjusting urging
restraining until the long line of coaches
again followed its flying leader in steady
flight and sailed around the wide curve with
the grace of a hawk in air

  duly they delivered the pair of cooing
doves who apparently were supposed to be
living on showers of rice and in due time
the judge strode away in majesty up the
shaded street of a suburban puddle in which
the days run

lie was perhaps the biggest toad turning
at the curb from daily habit -he waved a
paternal farewell to billy much as one might
say

  your greatest work is done my son
now run along to your supper

  and billy strong in the habit grown of
another view-point waved a polite adieu and
turned with merry eyes to meet labenburgs
slow smile as he fixed for the far-reaching
miles ahead

  where the tracks spanned the deep and
rocky bed of a clear babbling stream and
broad smooth-clipped lawns sloped up among
tall firs to a secluded city of refuge upon a
swelling knoll of the prairie they came to a
halt with no ring of bell or sound of whistle

  there the madman with hands encased
and unseeing eyes stalked up the knoll sing-
ing over and over again a plaintive refrain
it struck a quavering chord with the low
notes which billy drew from the bell at
starting until it wavered away with the mans
receding figure among the trees and was
swallowed up in the thickening exhaust of
the engine

  the open book of the days run lay again
before labenburg who was looking stead-
fastly ahead on the track far and wide
upon the great steel web of track that has
reclaimed the wilderness and made it the no-
blest workshop and playground of the world
a host of othe labenburgs were reading
understanding- without qualm of fear or
wide-eyed haste other familiar pages of the
daily story of the track-the vivid common
story of a common day from pages which
are changing with the moments

  the sleeping country roads were growing
more marked in the slanting rays of the sun
and the engine crooned a deep low mono-
tone through the wooded places as she fled
across the long level through the busy
teeming hours she rocked and steadied and
plunged ahead climbing among rugged oaks
rises in loud-voiced triumph and again
chanting a low requiem over the straight
and silent places

  where the prairie was dotted by widely
grouped cottages in the distance the train
again stopped some new-formed arcadia
welcomed the careworn immigrants they
turned their tired faces eager-eved to the

reddening rays of the sinking sun shoulder-
ing their crude luggage from the baggage-car
with many lowly bows and trailing away
into their new land of promise to claim a
manhood they had never known

  the hands of the big illuminated clock in
the station were drawing close to seven of the
evening and the piercing rays of the big
torch high upon the city liall tower were
flashing farewell signals after the departed
sun when the train came hurrying steadily
out of the darkening maze of the afterglow
across the waving fields and thrust itself
into the narrowing throat of the terminal
yards

  it glided into the lighted gloom of the big
station exactly at seven by the hands upon
the glowing dial high upon the wall beyond
the ends of the tracks a final vibrant hiss
from the brake-valve spoke sharply to the
engine looming large toward the guard-post
which stood directly in its path slower and
slower the menacing engine crept nearer the
obstruction until in the last forward turn
labenburg set the brake-valve handle to full
release and the train was still and free
without a demurring lurch free as it had
been through the living hours in the free-
dom of a sure control

  all was quiet for a moment except the
regular pulsing of the air-pump then the
station renewed its murmur of restrained life
-so like the murmur of a shell from the sea
then came a group of men who took the
golden treasure from its car and carried it
away the hurrying throng flowed by un-
notingand unnoted the days run was
finished

  a little later a happy-faced woman looked
up in the failing light from among the flow-
ers in an old-fashioned doorvard as the gate-
latch clicked under labenburgs hand

  prompt as ever john she said was
it a pleasant run to-day

  like canoeing on the river in june
mother he answered where are the
children 

   they were with me here until they saw
you coming they have supper ready now

   suppose we tie up those nasturtiums in
the morning suggested labenburg

   i was thinking of that when you came
she replied

the transportation problem is a national issue the best talent of the
country is in constant demand to handle it-the vice-president
      water-tank
  wisdom

 a derail is like providence-appealed to
 as a last resource

 if opportunity flags you dont be too tickled
 to read the orders

 a little authority makes some men as over-
 bearing as the high rail on a curve

 where theres smoke theres fire but-the
 hottest fire makes the least smoke

                       better a lowly pedigree in a meadow than
                      noble ancestry in a damage claim

                      he is a wise despatcher who never says
                       one reading of the order is sufficient

beware of head-on collisions at lifes meet-
ing-points the wrecker cleans up both trains

  bad luck runs on no schedule and you are
apt to meet it going and coming-but its the
same with good luck

  dont sit in the shade of the mogul and
tell the tallow-pot how disappointing life is
tis a poor way to get over the hill

the railroad mans magazine

the following business card in the pippin-
ville banner of a local attorney

clay calhoune sokum
attorney

real estate and insurance

corporation law a specialty

  there it was

  other things might claim immediate at-
tention but the main fact stood out in bold
announcement that in the one particular di-
rection of corporation law sokum was using
a term not exactly taken from blackstone
but otherwise elegant and forceful sokum
was the original ring-tailed peeler

  let us get the idea clearly in the dry
and dusty village of pippinville there are no
resident corporations of any kind only the
placid routine of a country town i had a
curiosity to know why under such uninviting
surroundings sokum had turned into the
avenue of corporation law

  i asked the shoemaker the livery-stable
man and the blacksmith but none of them
knew then i called on sokum

  he had a lean cassius look and his tunic
was somewhat shiny at the elbows and frayed
about the edges

  to my question of why he lifted a high
brow and replied

  i am a young man of thirty twenty
years from now there wont be anything but
corporations theyll own all the little
stores and shops and work places and the
individual man will be only a part i will
be but fifty then and in the zenith of my
power and intellect and i will know it be-
cause i have made a specialty of it

  but for the present i asked

 we have the railroad	-

are you attorney for the railroad

  no but i hope to be they tell me
they do not need an attorney at pippinville
but they may see different i represent the
people the people vs the railroad the
people suffer impositions sir and injustices
sir and outrages sir and remain silent un-
less there is some one that knows and can
secure redress for them

   do you have many cases against the rail-
road  

  now and then it is necessary to insti-
gate suit i have had a few cases and i
have beaten em sir he added with an em-
phasis of triumph  i have recovered for

my clients from the railroad that is a
great satisfaction for a rising young lawyer
sir because the railroad is alert and skilled
and is a foe worthy of the steel figurative
speech-he meant steal of any lawyer

  when i beat em it adds prestige to my
name these small squabbles between neigh-
bors heard before a justice of the peace dont
get a lawyer anywhere but when you beat
the railroad the whole community sits up and
praises you for turning the trick

   if you can beat em a few times youve
made a reputation and thats necessary- to a
lawyer sir as i said before there wont
be anything but corporations after a while
and ill have my name made before the
younger attorneys wake up

  sokum got this off witli a serious and
dignified earnestness he had a few books
in his office and a second-hand typewriter
a layer of dust like a mantle of charity
covered everything his desk was littered
with unanswered and unfiled correspond-
ence and one end was piled high with the
come-on homesteading literature of the
great alkali desert for whose broad acres
sokum was the resident agent

  i was attracted to sokum because of the
suggestiveness of his name the unpromising
surroundings and the high resolve to make
corporation law a specialty when there was
but one corporation in sight

  i was curious to know what sokum had
done for the people in what way he had
circumvented the railroad what great prin-
ciples of law he had established in his com-
munity in fact just how he had proceeded
against the one corporation within his reach

  in truth there are sokums in every town
throughout this broad land

  in thinking of sokum and the railroad i
call to mind the old farm-horse that plods
along the best he can hauling the country
produce to market but stung and harassed
all along the dusty highway by a pesky gad-
fly after a drop of blood the railroad tries
to do its work but winces under insect stings
at every turn

  i	made a few inquiries and i gathered a
few little incidents in sokums career which
illustrate the operation of a village attorney
who makes corporation law a specialty

  the station baggage-master told me this
one

  an old man wearing a blue uniform and
a g a r badge had a canvas suit - case
checked to pippinville it failed to arrive
and that road was unable to locate it after
the usual search
observations of a country station-agent



   it did not occur to the old soldier to ask
   the railroad company to compensate him for
   his loss

   after roundly abusing the baggage-master
and hurling a few choice anathemas at rail-
 roads in general he told his troubles to
sokum

   sokum made formal demand on the rail-
   road to produce the grip

 no grip	

   then he held a star-chamber conference
   with his client

snookenheimer ive wore that suit three
years does that make any difference
not in the least assured sokum posing
his pencil now what else

   they wasnt anything else

  what protested sokum nothing else
in the grip think again man didnt
you have any jewelry

   only my g a r badge-an i got that
on

  any shoes or underwear think again
man surely you had something else in it

dollars and
all i git  

   weve got to know every article thats in
the grip said sokum

  well replied the old soldier they
aint much in it theys a second-hand suit
its been wore some it cost me eight dol-
lars and fifty cents

   all right said sokum  one suit-
eighteen dollars and fifty cents

   eight dollars corrected the client
oh eight dollars thats pretty cheap
wed better make it ten thatll be letting
them off pretty easy not much of a suit
under ten dollars one suit ten dollars
what other furnishings

  they was a quart bottle of good old

   	rr

one bottle of herb-liver tonic one dollar
thats eleven dollars

   they was a handkerchief in the coat-
pocket

  good one silk muffler fifty cents
thats eleven and one-half wasnt there
something else in the other pocket  

  the client gave a dismal shake of the
head

   i told the baggage-man what was in the
grip said he

  sokum shook a reproving finger at him
 dont never do a thing like that dont
tell em anything tell me you damage
your own case by talk you must never


the railroad mans magazine

talk wlien youve got to sue thats what
the other side wants they want you to talk
then they know all about your case

  the client batted his eyes in bewilder-
ment

  theres the grip itself- continued so-
kum  a good leather suit-case costs five
dollars

    taint leather- corrected the client
 i bought it of ikestein six years ago its
canvas it cost seventy-five cents

    seventy-five cents-six years ago every-
things gone up worth one dollar to-day
one canvas suit-case one dollar total
twelve dollars and fifty cents only twelve
dollars and fifty cents

  sokum repeated this with evident disgust
 seems to me you would have some other
articles in there

   thats all they was insisted the obtuse
client

  all right then ill make em dance
now dont you have anything to do with
em if they tell you anything or write to
you you come to me with it if they ask
you to call and sign for anything you come
to me and i will go with you they wont
play any shenanigan on you when im with
you dont go near em yourself you see
you are taking an affidavit to this and if it
aint exactly right youre in for it so if
anything turns up you come right straight
to me

  in time the client returned and handed
sokum a postal-card

    its a notice for me to call at the freight-
office -

  well go right down said sokum sei-
zing his hat  i put it up to them they
had to settle or have a lawsuit they knew
that when they saw the case was in my
hands

   a few minutes later the client and his at-
torney appeared at the counter at the freight-
house

  the agent produced a voucher and the
old soldier signed it

  the agent thereupon laid out a ten-dollar
note and two dollars and fifty cents in frac-
tional coin

  attorney sokum stretched forth a grasping
hand and appropriated the ten-dollar note
the client raked in the silver

  they passed outside

  is two dollars and a half all i git
asked the client with tentative innocence

  no fault of mine replied sokum
that you didnt have more articles in that

grip-

   well we beat em enyway didnt we
chuckled the client in feeble triumph
wont you come over and have a drink

    dont care if i do said sokum ill
take one on you

   this uns on the railroad grinned the
client

   in the evening the old soldier a little un-
steady on his underpinnings approached the
attorney for the purpose of artfully nego-
tiating the loan of a quarter

    jush len me twenty-fi cents he said

    cant do it said sokum  cant spare
a cent heres one of my cards better keep
it with you all the time

   the old man held it out before him and
through misty and confused eyes made out
enough of it to mumble corporation law
speclilty

  the next case that came to sokum was
that of a farmer living near pippinville who
had a muck-patch of about two acres in a
field near the railroad the soil on it was
of exceedingly light vegetable mold it
would not hold moisture the crops planted
thereon would burn out in the scorching days
of summer

   the only thing the farmer ever raised on
it was a luxuriant crop of weeds that were
adapted to those conditions in all the years
the two acres had made no returns to the
owner

  during a particularly dry and dead pe-
riod a spark from a passing locomotive lit
in the patch and started a fire there was
no available water and it burned for two
months smoldering widening and eating
away the surface and dying out only after
the entire fluffy top-dressing of two or more
feet had been entirely consumed and the
clay subsoil had been reached

   sokum viewed the devastation with horror

   he went after the railroad in behalf of the
farmer he prepared a complaint in which
he set forth the richness and fertility of the
spot true it was not adapted to corn or
wheat but it was to be devoted to rhododen-
drons and whortleberries - specialized and
highly profitable crops of that particular
spot and adapted to that particular soil-
but now alas the culture of which must be
abandoned

  they asked three hundred dollars dam-
age from the railroad but finally compro-
mised on one hundred and twenty-five

   sokum got fifty dollars

    you see he explained to the farmer

 if i hadnt shown the possibilities of whor-
tleberry culture on that patch and what you
observations of a country station-agent



were going to lose by not being able to raise
them you wouldnt have received a cent
you can just consider yourself seventy-five
dollars to the good

   what are them whattleberries   asked
the farmer innocently

  the crossing had been provided at one
time but in the course of some track work
had been taken out and not restored

  there was some delay and die fanner
grew fretful in this condition of mind he
sought sokum

  the following year having gotten rid of
the light loose top - dressing the farmer
plowed over the two acres put them in corn
and got a crop for the first time

  the railroad redeemed his land for him
and paid him for the privilege

  then there was the case of another
farmer whose land lay on each side of the
track and who wanted a private crossing
and was entitled to it according to the origi-
nal right-of-way agreement he mentioned
it once or twice to the section-foreman

  sokum wrote a letter to the president of
the road setting forth the grievance of his
client and demanding a crossing at once

  it is the disposition of the private citizen
who has no definite idea of railroad organi-
zation to appeal to the highest official when-
ever there are woes to ventilate

  it is the crude conception that one so high
will hand an awful jolt to the negligent or
erring underling and which thought adds
a sort of secret joy of vengeance

  sokums letter pointed and threatening

tmture

jcnw-m- har-

   jush len me
   twentv-fl cents
the railroad mans magazine

and limiting the time of action to ten brief
days came to the official who had the work
to do at a somewhat leisurely gait so that
it was five days from the date it was written
until it found the proper official

  some time before this the section-foreman
had reported the matter and on the afternoon
that sokum licked the postage-stamp for the
letter to the highest official the crossing was
put in

  sokum learned of this before the farmer
himself did so in order to make good he
got in communication with the farmer at
once and handed out this line of talk with
a boisterous fighting voice a clenched fist
and hit-em-in-the-solar-plexus gesture

  no use to fool with a railroad no use
to waste any time writing em i telegraphed
em i gave em just three days-three days
from the day you called on me if that cross-
ings not in in three days well do em to a
frazzle ill go after em for damages-
heavy damages they know it too ive
been after them before they know me
and when i put this up to them as i did in
this telegram the- know somethings got to
be done quick you go out there to-mor-
row or day after and see if they have put it

in if its not in by day after to-morrow
let me know at once thats the last min-
ute ill give em 

  the farmer went out the second day to in-
spect and report he found a new crossing

  he hurried to sokum and reported

  sokum gave a triumphant snort

   they know me i have had business
with em before when we put it up to
em by telegraph they knew something had
to be done and quick too if they burn
your meadow or kill any of your stock let
me know about it keep one of my cards
we sually charge heavier on corporation
ca-ro than in others but ten dollars will be
satisfactory in this case thank you call
again dont forget if anything else turns
up let me know

  in the meantime sokums letter was on its
 respectively referred  route from the presi-
dent to the local track supervisor and he had
about as much to do with having the crossing
built as founding the modern order of mol-
lycoddles

  the ten-dollar fee should have gone to the
section-foreman

  this is corporation law in the country
in the city there are more ramifications and
perhaps more dignity to the pro-
ceedings and more complications
than are presented in cases involv-
ing private crossings burned-over
muck-patches and stolen grips
but most of it however high-
sounding and complex is graft or
larceny of some sort

railroads are keenly aware of
this

we next hear of sokum as a
passenger  one of our trains

it was our through train to cin-
cinnati that makes no stop be-
tween kokomo and anderson but
sokum complacent and confident
from previous triumphs
handed the conductor a
ticket reading to frank-
ton an intermediate no-
stop town

      i cannot accept this
ticket explained the con-
ductor  this train does not stop
at frankton

it will to-day coolly replied
sokum

on whose authority asked
the conductor

 on that ticket i called for
a ticket to frankton it was sold

 maybe yog dont know who youre talking to
explained sokum
observations of a country station-agent



 to me for this train i was allowed to board
 this train and i expect to get off at frank-
 ton

 the conductor called the porter

 did he tell you he was going to frank-
 ton when he got aboard he asked

whats this got to do with it he

asked

 see that pointed sokum  corpora-
tion law a specialty dont you think i know
what im talking about when i say this train
will stop at frankton

two men behind him gave the names of
john doe and kichard roe

no suh replied the porter the gen-
tleman suttenly said anderson

i said frankton asserted sokum
this train doesnt stop at frankton

 it will to-day

  not this day we will take you to an-
derson and it will cost you twenty-live cents
additional	

   you will not get another cent and you
will not take me to anderson i have bought
a ticket to frankton i was admitted to this
coach for frankton and you have lifted my
ticket to frankton so this train stops at
frankton to-day

  now conductors however well trained or
however fine the discipline have certain hu-
man qualities the rules of conduct govern-
ing in this case indicate a polite firmness
a well-constrained and genteel positiveness
nevertheless the conductor shot out his jaw
and snapped authoritatively in a high de-
cisive voice

  i tell you we wont 

  the two glared at each other for a bit
maybe you dont know who youre talk-
ing to explained sokum  heres my
card

  the conductor took the proffered card and
read it

  he was not overawed

  that dont tell me anything shouted
the conductor  maybe you would like to
look at one of my cards running a train
a specialty

  all i want you to understand is that i
know my rights retorted sokum  i want
you to have fair warning because youll
hear from this if you do not make this stop
it will cost your road something and you
will be made personally responsible no
doubt i have an important engagement on
the arrival of this train the damage if
you dont stop will be a good sum dont
think i will surrender my rights passively i
will exhaust the law in every detail

  with this legal defi sokum sat daringly
upright and looked out of the car-window
at the passing scenery which indicated to
him that frankton was only three miles
away

  the conductor went to the forward end
of the coach and spoke a few words to the
brakeman after which the brakeman passed


the railroad mans magazine

out into the vestibule the conductor paid
no further attention to sokum

  the train whistled for frankton

  the town reposes in a little valley and
trains pass through it at the highest speed

  sokum arose and glanced anxiously at the
conductor who turned his back indifferently
sokum expected to hear the grind of the
brakes and feel the slackening momentum of
the train but instead the outlying houses
went flying by him at terrific speed

  sokum had not exhausted his resources
he grasped the bell-rope and gave three
lusty pulls-three triumphant tugs there
was no response from the engineer but so-
kum did not notice that

  he grasped a small satchel and went for-
ward to be ready to alight but the main
street a business block an elevator and the
depot all whizzed by in one blurred and in-
definite streak

  he hurried to his seat and looked out

  there was no mistake they had passed
through frankton like a shot from a gun

  a mile or two farther along the conductor
sauntered by spying sokum he gave a start
of surprise

   by george brother  he exclaimed
you forgot to get off at frankton

  sokum whipped out a pencil and a mem-
orandum-card and began writing furiously

  youll hear from this he snapped
you wont be so gay when im done with
you 

  he made insistent inquiry of near-by pas-
sengers for names and addresses for use in
sokum vs the railroad some refused to
give him anv and two men behind him gave
the names of john doe and richard roe of
poeville indiana-handy names for legal
conjuring

  nor was that the full extent of the hu-
miliation suffered by sokum

  he was compelled to produce the necessary
fare between frankton and anderson he
did this under formal and furious protest
carefully putting away the cash fare receipt
and serving notice on all that there would
be a final reckoning it was either that for
him or the dusty highway between the two
towns

  now the real truth of this little incident

was that sokum had purchased a ticket earl
in the day for a local train but missed it
and in the necessity of getting to frankton
had hit upon this expediency of having the
fast train stop

  he knew the bell - cord if pulled three
times would bring the desired results even
if the conductor was obdurate

  the bluff did not work with the conduc-
tor and as for the bell-cord the brakeman
was wise he stood in the vestibule with
a keen eye and when sokum reached for the
cord he deftly disconnected it from the valve
sokum might just as well have tugged at his
own watch-chain so far as any signal to the
engineer was concerned

  ordinarily these simple narratives of the
legal luminary of pippinville whose special-
ty is corporation law would not have been
collected and set forth if attention to him
had not been called by recent political events
of that borough

  sokum has been honored by his party

  in a mass convention in which the pee-
pul  select some one whom the bosses pick
out for them to vote for sokum was named
for the state assembly

  next year lie will probably figure in the
output of nefw and revised statutes with  cor-
poration law a specialty

  there should be no surprise if in the grist
there is one making all trains stop at all sta-
tions at all public highways at all private
farm-crossings or wherever a downtrodden
citizen may wish to crook a beckoning fin-
ger

  that blurred strak of landscape known
as frankton is indelibly printed on sokums
mind and will produce something

  a surprising number of legal regulations
that annoy and hamper in railroading come
from little petty grievances of legislators that
are purely personal

  in time sokum may go to congress

  then if he can put in a few corporation
kinks he will become what the country press
calls a great statesman accent and triple-
tongue the word g-r-e-a-t

  congressman clay calhoune sokum

 moments of emergency

by arno dosch

few engineers have not been called on at one time or another to think and
act quickly in order to prevent a wreck notwithstanding the many pre-
cautions of modern railroading the unforeseen happens and whether it
is a broken side-rod a loose rail or another locomotive that happened to get in
the way the result is the same old story unless it is prevented by the quick wit
of the eagle-eye

    some hoggers have had closer shaves than others but all have had their ex-
citing moments though emergencies occur that offer no choice but a leap for
life others arise which give an engineer a chance to prove whether or not he
contains the stuff of which heroes are made and like the men of which mr
dosch writes will stick to his post no matter what the consequences may be

the numerous attempts of locomotives with broken side-rods disabled
throttles and similar troubles to land themselves
and their masters in the scrap pile

bankers special was begin-
ning to click-click over the
frogs through the network of
tracks approaching the harlem
river station and the business
men coming from their country
places to their down-town offices at the leis-
urely hour of ten laid aside their papers and
picked up their overcoats the train was
speeding toward the grand central station
at its usual gait of forty miles an hour and
in only a few minutes they would be whipping
through the subway down to wall street

  a shiver passed through the cars then an-
other followed by a slight jolt within ten
seconds the train was jerking convulsively
along and the men who dealt daily in mil-
lions without the bat of an eyelash became
frightened and leaped instinctively to their
feet in a mad desire to jump but before one
qf them could steady himself in the aisle
there was a terrific jar and the train stopped
dead

  walking into the station a few minutes
later the passengers saw the engine of the
train they had just left locked with a heavy

freight - locomotive which stood on a cross-
over blocking the track many of them had
come to town safely on that train for years
and regarded it as infallible but here they
saw before their eyes a wreck they had missed
by the skin of their teeth

  for a moment they grew cold with the
thought of what might have happened but
within a week they were passing the spot
every morning as unconcernedly as ever and
properly so for lightning is riot apt to strike
twice in the same place and there was small
chance that there would ever be another wreck
or accident again at that point

  after they had all gone engineer edward
ballon of the express and engineer trafford
of the freight allowed themselves the luxury
of a shiver or two then they looked at each
other without a word the situation was be-
yond speech if they had not been engineers
they would have pinched themselves to see if
they were actually alive but their long train-
ing on the iron monsters caused them to waste
no time on studying their sensations and soon
they had backed their limping engines away
and cleared the track


the railroad mans magazine

  though the bankers may have forgotten
the spot ballon has not and ever since that
day april   as he whirls by at sixty
miles an hour he wonders how he ever suc-
ceeded in bringing the train to a stop in so
short a space

  his is an important train and to it belongs
the right of way he is used to having the
track open and his schedule calls for high
speed straight through the yards there are
cross-overs every few rods but he pays no
attention to them at  every morning as
he rattles over the frogs they are all supposed
to be clear

  on this morning however trafford pull-
ing a freight from behind the roundhouse at
one hundred and thirty-third street
could not see or hear him coming and he
was equally obscure to ballon even when
he was within a hundred yards of the cross-
over ballon had had no warning of the dan-
ger and he approached swiftly and certainly
to what seemed an unavoidable collision

  there was no one to give warning and
the first intimation either had of the impend-
ing wreck was when ballon with eyes trained
on the track ahead suddenly saw the pilot of
the huge locomotive come out from behind
the roundhouse and approach the cross-over
not fifty feet away behind was a long train
of heavily loaded cars

a wreck averted

  it made no differencewhich one reached
the cross-over first ballon would plunge
into the freight and pile up his train behind
him or trafford would rip out the side of
the passenger - cars as they swung past his
engine either meant dead and mutilated
bodies and all the awful carnage of a wreck

  it takes long in the telling but both ballon
and trafford acted in a hundredth of a
second the brakes went on in a flash and
the engines fairly leaped from the rails
trafford moving more slowly was able to
come to a full stop just in front of the express
but ballon with all his power on the reverse
slipped dangerously neither man left the
throttle as the quick seconds flew by risking
their lives to minimize the shock when
they struck ballon still had a fair headway
but not enough to do damage

  if it had not been for ballons presence of
mind there would have been a different story
to tell indeed stories of this kind are rarely
told at all engineers who have narrow
escapes are not prone to enlarge on the ex-
perience instead they forget as rapidly as

possible if they remembered their nerves
could not stand it

  with all the modern devices to safeguard
travel there are more emergencies than any
one dreams of at such times the lives of the
passengers are in the hands of the men in the
cab their quick action has averted many a
crash and more than one train has come to the
depot untouched on account of the heroism
of the engineer

when the side-rod snapped

  having made the top of pickerel mountain
above somerville new jersey joseph lutz
engineer on the easton express of the cen-
tral railroad of new jersey had opened up
for the long run down into the valley when
he heard something snap at the same in-
stant the engine shook with a sudden jar and
before he could look to see what had hap-
pened the immense driving-rod which had
broken loose flashed gleaming above the
boiler flaying the air and intent on mis-
chief

  as it came down it plunged into a pile of
ballast scooped up a charge of rocks and
gravel and as if maliciously intent on dis-
abling its driver hurled the whole mass
straight into the cab

  lutz dodged and reached for the lever but
the rod gleamed high again and on the
second revolution smashed down upon the
cab itself knocking the mechanism out of
kilter and making it certain death to touch
it again and again it spun around each
time knocking the controlling gear into a
more hopeless mass and sending the smaller
steel parts in a shower over lutz one piece
struck the fireman and he fell in a heap

  from running a quickly responsive and
obedient engine lutz all at once had on his
hands a wild raging monster lashing itself
into a fury and running at will down the
mountain there was the ever-increasing
danger that it would not be able to hold to
the rails on a curve and would leap still
more furiously over the embankment pulling
the cars filled with passengers into a sudden
and absolutely unexpected death

locomotive bare-back riding

  just beyond was a bad curve and half a
mile farther on one that the engine could
not take unless lutz succeeded in shutting oft
the steam

  this was lutzs moment of action even -
thing that he was used to depending upon had
moments of emergency



been cut away by the flaying rod and yet
he had to do something and do it quick
what he planned was heroic but he did not
think of the danger his one thought was to
stop that train

  stepping over the prostrate body of the
fireman he climbed without hesitation upon
the scorching back of the boiler and started

there was but one thing to do with the
bell-rope in his hand he let go and swung
for the valve there was a sudden strain
on his wrist he reached for the valve and
swung back to safety as a white cloud shot
into the air that was seen a mile back by
the automobilists still sitting with their
mouths and eyes wide open staring at the

cant you get a

rowboat 

forward to reach the controlling gear
from the outside

  each spot seemed hotter than the
one he had just left but slipping from one
to another he made his painful way the
furious driving-rod still lashing within a few
feet of his body and throwing a constant hail
of rocks and pebbles past him

  grade crossings are thick on that track
and burning as he was he seized the bell-
rope and gave warnings at one was an
automobile with all the occupants still lean-
ing forward from the shock of a sudden stop
and they forgot to move as their upturned
white faces stared in wonder at the madman
in overalls and jumper fearlessly working his
way along the back of the rocking pitching
scorching boiler

  the passengers whizzing past saw the
look of surprise and horror on the counte-
nances of the automobilists and an uneasy
feeling that something was wrong flashed
from car to car but although the coaches
rocked dangerously at the curves no one
could imagine what was the matter and all
sat in an uneasy silence while the train ran
wild down the mountainside

  as they hit the first curve lutz had to hold
tight for a second with the wheels screeching
beneath him and the rails groaning under the
strain but it was past in a moment and right
ahead was the curve he knew the train could
not take under a full head of steam

  it was a question of fractions of a second

runaway train five minutes later the rails
ran out upon the plain and the broken dri-
ving-rod lashed slower and slower until the
train came to a sickening standstill then
lutz dropped wilted to the ground

crowleys steam bath

  on april  of this year a few days be-
fore lutz showed what a man could do in an
emergency a switch-engine in the yards of
the same railroad had its steering gear dis-
abled in a collision and ran uncontrollable
through the terminal while the engineer
john crowley enveloped in a cloud of steam
labored hard to regain control he was
burned frightfully even through his clothes
and the exposed skin was curled to a crisp
causing intense pain but he did not have a
thought of leaving his post-he was not the
kind of man to do that

  he was backing a string of cars across the
yard when a box car attached to an engine
which had cleared the track started back a
few feet just far enough to sideswipe crow-
leys switch-engine breaking the side of the


the railroad mans magazine

cab and disconnecting the steam-pipes and
doing other serious damage

  instantly the scalding steam surrounded
crowley penetrating his clothes and attack-
ing his skin he could hardly breathe but he
stood there forcing himself to inhale the
steam which stung his flesh and seared his
lungs unbearably

  he might have ducked and jumped but
his first thought was to stop the engine so
there he stood his eyes closed his nostrils
inflamed his lips sealed undergoing all the
tortures of a fiendish punishment reaching
blindly at the gear only to find that it had
been so completely bent and shattered he
could not move a lever

  all the time the engine under increasing
headway was swinging through the yard
with a string of cars ahead all the passen-
ger-tracks lay in its way but fortunately all
were clear as it snapped over one cross-over
after another until it ran at full speed into
a bulkhead overlooking the river after six
hundred yards at increasing speed first one
box car then another smashed into the bulk-
head and over it into the river the third
crumpled and stopped the train

  when the nearest switchmen rushed to the
cab they found crowley bent low to escape
the steam his skin burned as red as a lob-
sters still jerking blindly at the levers

lucky mcgatts high dive

  when an engineer has come through a good
many accidents without being permanently
injured he gets the name of being lucky but
what has really saved him is usually a cool
head such a reputation has been built up
about one of the most picturesque figures in
the railroad world lucky mcgatt

  for fifty-three years until a few months
ago he drove trains over the delaware divi-
sion of the erie and forty-eight of them he
spent in the passenger service for con-
tinuous service on one division as far as
any one knows this is the record yet he is
a stalwart hearty man and does not look a
day over fifty-three

  they call him  lucky  mcgatt because
he has received severe injuries in but one
hand has but one lame shoulder a leg that
gets stiff only now and then and a cranky
place in his back that troubles him less than
half the time otherwise he is all right but
after half a century in the cab any one will
admit that he surely is in lucky

   he scoffs at the idea that he is especially
fortunate and refuses to talk about his hair-

breadth escapes but there are plenty of peo-
ple who know about them during the time
that he has been railroading there have been
big improvements and accidents are scarcer
now but thirty or forty years ago the rail-
roads were streaked with blood from one end
to the other although he has been derailed
many times however and found himself
headed for the ditch with monotonous regu-
larity he lives to refuse to tell the tale

  on one occasion a good many years ago
so long past that no ones memory is good
enough to hold the date as he was swinging
around a sharp curve along the delaware
the outer rail suddenly gave way and before
he could realize what was up he was driving
his locomotive over the cliff into the river

he wanted a boat

  on occasions of this kind the engineer
usually winds up at the bottom of the stream
with the full weight of the locomotive hold-
ing him down but not so mcgatt as the
engine shot out into space he made a remark-
ably quick move for a heavy man standing
six feet two and although he hit the water
rather more suddenly than he cared about he
made hisdive some distance from where the
engine plunged under

  the water was deep at that point but not
too deep to prevent mcgatt from boring a
hole straight through it to the bottom and
injuring his hand on the rocks it did not
stun him however and as soon as he came
to the surface he struck out for the nearest
landing-place

  with all the forward end of the train in
the river the crew and the passengers who
had not been hurt rushed forward the
rear end of the second baggage-car was half-
submerged and ahead of it were the first
baggage-car and the engine barely showing
giving the effect of a huge sea-serpent reach-
ing down from the track into the river be-
yond on a rock sat mcgatt

  in the tense moments following a wreck
those on the bank stood and stared at him
but he only waved his hand impatiently and
is quoted as calling out

    cant you get a rowboat  

   it used to be a favorite trick with engines
to jump off the high embankments into the
dejaware and mcgatt is not the only engi-
neer who has escaped death by keeping his
eyes open

  john kinsla a veteran engineer hardly
less known among railroad men than mcgatt
had the most thrilling leap of all what
moments of emergency



made it worse was that it followed imme-
diately upon a head-on collision

how kinsla escaped

  on august   he had in his train
the famous stable of horses which belonged
to mrs langtry each in gorgeously fitted
box cars speeding along this section of the
delaware he came upon a freight on a sharp
turn one hundred and fifty feet above the
river and a wreck ensued that has gone
down in racing history all the horses were

hq begun and he was carried unwillingly
along

  in a moment his consciousness left him
but his last movement must have been to pull
himself through the door of the cab other-
wise he would have been mangled beneath
the engine as it was the engine got there
first and although kinsla had no feather bed
to land on bounced with comparative gentle-
ness to the bottom and was overjoyed to find
himself still alive

  this particular stretch of road is full of
stories of hairbreadth escapes principally

burned but before this catastrophe overtook
them kinsla had one of the most exciting
falls from which a man ever escaped alive
at the end he was apparently torn almost to
pieces but in spite of the fact that he has
recently been retired on the age limit of sev-
enty he now shows no signs beyond a few
scars

  the other engine swung kinslas at right
angles from the track abrupt over the em-
bankment in a straight fall to the water at
that moment kinsla who had recovered from
the first shock realized what was happening
to him and looked forward into the void
into which he was plunging in a flash it
came to him that it would be better to hit the
bottom alone than with the engine but before
he could free himself the downward plunge

because so many of the old-timers are still on
the job when they go many of those inter-
esting tales will be lost with them one of the
oldest veterans is e r dunne who was a
conductor even before the civil war a
wreck finally got him and put his legs out
of commission but he escaped a good many
before he was finally laid low

dunne cuts loose

  his was the day when signals were in their
infancy the engineer  wild-catted  and
the conductor made sidings watch in hand
with his eye on the second-hand

before daylight on an icy morning when

he shot over the edge into the ditch


the railroad mans magazine

the cars were coated with frozen sleet dunne
pulled out eastward on the early freight from
elmira as he passed the cab before pulling
out from the yards dunne called out casually
to lay in at the siding at rogers and not go
on as usual to meet the express at meadows
dunne based his order on his fear that the
track would be slippery and the engineer
knew it but he had a watch of his own and
he took dunnes orders for what he consid-
ered them to be worth

  when rogers was reached the train bowled
right along through without stopping and
dunne glancing at his watch suddenly
looked as if he were struck dumb

  jump to the engine he cried to the
nearest brakeman  tell him to back in
there isnt time to reach meadows 

  the brakeman was already on the outside
with dunne close behind but half-way
across the first car his feet went out from
under him and he shot over the edge into
the ditch another brakeman pushed past
crouching low with feet wide apart and
hands - touching the ice-covered boards
painfully working his way along he risked
his life each time he passed from car to car
but he was slowly getting forward with
dunne scarcely breathing on the caboose
when he attempted to navigate a car-load of
lumber he slipped tottered reached out

wildly and shot over the edge after the first
brakeman

  it was up to dunne now there was no
time for another failure- he had to get
there kicking off his boots he started over
the train in his woolen socks the bitter
cold striking up through his feet chilled
him through and through but somehow he
made it

  by this time however it was too late to
turn back there was at most one minute to
spare with the switch at meadows only
three hundred yards ahead

  calculating swiftly he saw that the only
chance was to run for it and as he passed
to the tender he released the engine from the
train

  freed of its load the engine sprang for-
ward and in half a minutes time had made
the switch with the whole train ambling
along by itself coming slowly to a standstill

  not waiting for the engine to clear the
main track dunne leaped to ihe frozen
ground leaving a trail of blood behind him
as he raced toward the approaching train

  before any one could think the passenger-
train letting up on its speed in jerks had
run by the engine just as it made the siding
and jarred to a full stop when it struck the
first of the string of freight-cars in its last
spasmodic movements

why hood swore

wtlliam hood chief engineer of the
southern pacific is one of the most nerv-
ous men in the railroad business what he does
is done well but he always insists that every pen
or pencil that he might need be right where he
can place his hand on it

fice at seven oclock he walked into one of the

   he doesnt get here until eight oclock sir

giving ramsey the ha ha

by frank condon

    the croton valleys fireman who could give romeo
    cards and spades and make adonis look like a two-spot

dont care what anybody says
growled curtis gloomily  its
not murder to kill a guy like ram-
sey he is a blot on the face
of an otherwise fair civilization

ramsey is a stiff - a perfume-
buyin stiff-and some one of these sunny
mornings im goin to come up behind him
with a wrench and close up his worldly
affairs

   youre sore about his stealing your girl
grinned allis

  so are you roared curtis youre
afraid to say so and im not he cops out
your little mamie and you sneak around like
a spanked spaniel and laugh about it one
of these days something is going to happen to
ramsey thats no kid something
bad is going to happen to that coal-
shoveler and when it gets through
happening to him theres going to be
a new fireman permanently on the ex-
press	-

   fish and chalmers nodded approv-
ingly and the conference came to a
conclusion the ramsey in question
-mr joseph ramsey of lehigh-
pursued the even tenor of his way fifty
miles off in ignorance of the hostility
he had engendered in sundry firemens
breasts

  when a given number of healthy
firemen begin to wish ill-luck on a
fellow member of the craft there is
usually some reason for it in the
case of joe ramsey the reason was
plain it was also widely known and
elderly engineers twitted their fire-
men unmercifully about the young-
ster from lehigh and his interference
with their various heart affairs

	in the first place joe ramsey was
the best-looking fireman on the cro-

ton valley railroad he was an adonis a
mercury and an apollo rolled into one his
jet-black hair fell over his white forehead in
maddening little curls furthermore he pos-
sessed the gift of gab to an alarming degree
and when he sat down beside a pensive maid-
en at a hop or a sociable and began to tell
her interesting things about herself and how
much better the world had been since she
came into it the girl usually melted like but-
ter in the sun

  the result of this happy combination of
pulchritude and conversational excellence was
wide dissension in the ranks of the other coal-
heavers  the croton valley

  if harry allis fell in love with some dainty
bit of lace and ribbon from topeka ramsey

the girl usually melted like
butter in the sun

q


the railroad mans magazine

heard of it he heard of it accidentally or
casually-but he always heard of it

  when he came across such information he
generally managed to meet the lady in ques-
tion and when that happened another male
heart burst with a rending crash and ramsey
chalked up another conquest

   if tim chalmers flirted with the sales-per-
son at princeton ramsey superflirted with the
same individual and mr chalmers backed
himself onto a siding and put out his lights

  when george curtis hurled himself madly
into a love affair with that paisley girl
ramsey trailed along cheerfully and cut
george out with nonchalance and complete
success it was to this painful episode that
harry allis referred whenever he felt he could
do so without suffering personal annihilation

    it aint so much that i dislike to be cut
out with my lady friends murmured mr
fish bitterly because ive beengetting cut
out since i had my first girl but it must be
done by a pretty person with curls and a half-
grown voice it may be that i aint exactly
in a position to see things as the girls see
them but ill be boiled to death if i can tell
what they see in joe ramsey

  the croton valley railroad hesitates
through several counties and finally winds
up with a lingering moan in the town of
princeton it would continue indefinitely if
it were not for a tall and stationary mountain
that has been sitting for many years directly
in the center of the right-of-way rather than
bore a hole through this mountain the direc-
tors of the croton valley decided to quit cold
and call princeton a terminus which is the
most dignified thing that has ever been said
of the place at the opposite end of the
c v r r is the city of lehigh right in
the middle of the road lies the peaceful ham-
let known on the map as topeka

  princeton topeka and lehigh femininity
paid homage to the charms of joe ramsey
until the remaining firemen on the c v
r r wept when they spoke of it when the
handsome fireman entertained a girl he
bought her ice - cream soda a ticket to the
moving-pictures and no more total cost
to ramsey thirty cents

  the girl went about for a week telling
people that she had had the time of her life

  if an ordinary fireman undertook to amuse
a lady he went under the bureau for the old
wallet and brought forth the remains of a
months salary which he spent in wild aban-
don and with a desperate desire to give optical
evidence of being a sport

   after some forty dollars worth of assorted

amusement the girl usually decided to go
home in order to avoid being further bored
and afterward she never referred to the event
it was this intolerable condition of affairs
that was slowly bringing on a mental nettle-
rash among the c v r r stokers the only
fireman on the road who looked with scorn
on the whole affair was ted riordan of
princeton riordan was happily engaged to
a cherry-cheeked hutton girl and die suffer-
ing of his fellow creatures was nothing to
him he and ellen hutton were to marry
in the spring

  george curtis sat on a lump of coal while
his engine was filling the tank and gave the
subject thought he looked back over the
saddening events of die past and shuddered
he reflected that the future was black with
the shadow of joe ramsey and just as he
was about to give up in despair and commit
suicide by diving into the tank an idea came
scudding around the side of die cab and hit
him with enough force to shatter die lump
of coal on which he cogitated

  whats the matter with you his engi-
neer asked later on you havent peeped
for half an hour

   im thinking of something important
curtis replied smiling ive just thought
of something that gives me pleasure

  two days later it chanced that a quorum
was present in the roundhouse at lehigh
and mr curtis announced that if everybody
interested would come outside he had some-
thing to say fish allis and chalmers fol-
lowed him over to the shade of the water-
tank with some suspicion

  you all know ted riordan began
curtis and you all know that pretty girl
of his ellen hutton

  we do said the group what of it
 and you know furthermore curtis
went on diat this here ramsey has been
clear daffy about teds girl ever since he
first saw her she was the one girl on the
croton valley line that he went after and did
not get of course one of the prime reasons
why he didnt get her was because she was
engaged to ted riordan anyway he didnt
cut ted out and i want you to remember
these historical facts because they got a lot
to do with what im about to explain
what is this anyhow fish inquired
politely

   its a scheme i thought out all by my-
self and at the present moment im going to
lay it before this committee for approval
its some scheme if i do say it myself and
its full of complications and fine points
giving ramsey the ha ha



and any fireman that dont understand the
first draft is at liberty to ask me questions
after im through making my talk

    i begin by saying that we all thoroughly
hate joe ramsey for what he palpably is
and for what he has done to the bunch in the
way of buttin in with the ladies there-
fore we all want to see him get his and get
it good dont we

    we do chorused the listeners

  ted riordan hates ramsey just as much
as the rest of us though maybe he isnt quite
so keen because he hasnt any personal spite
the rest of us has ted riordan has a girl
hes going to marry her in the spring and
that thought is certain gall and wormwood
to joe ramsey

   so far ramsey isnt able to get any-
where with teds girl but what if it should
happen from now on that he makes some
fair and favorable progress supposin for
instance that he begins to get around to the
movin pictures with ellen hutton

   yes and while youre supposin that
interrupted harry allis suppose you order
a coffin for joe ramsey because he certainly
will need it if he gets gay with teddy rior-
dans ellen there aint anything in this
mortal creation more certain than joes im-
mediate death supposing what youre sup-
posing

   if you will be good enough to can that
chatter until a sensible man gets through
talking retorted curtis  maybe you can
understand what my scheme is as i said
before this hair-trigger party busted in sup-
posin joe ramsey begins to get strong with
ellen hutton and when the big engineers
and firemens ball is pulled off a month or
two from now supposin joe ramsey takes
ellen hutton along to waltz instead of ted
riordan 

  are you out of your mind curtis in-
quired tim chalmers  this aint a scheme
youre cookin up this is part of the bug-
house scene from  romeo  and  hamlet in
the first place you know if you aint gone
clean nutty that ellen hutton wouldnt go
to no ball nor nowhere else if she didnt go
with ted riordan and if she did ted rior-
dan would commit all the crimes in the book
on the person who took her

   again i ask you all to hear me to the
concludin finish of my scheme before castin
criticisms i figure on having ellen hutton
go into this scheme with us and i figure
on havin ted riordan go into the scheme
too in other words this committee is goin
to call on teddy and ellen and ask them

 please if they wont hook up with us and
 help us out we get ted to consent-then
 we get ellen

    and then what 

   then continued curtis triumphantly
  we come to the grand finale of this plot
 which is the disgrace and utter rout of joe
 ramsey the same to be visible and audible

 to everybody who can crowd along the upper
 railing of mccooks dance hall on the night
 of the engineers and firemens ball

   i figure this way with teddy rior-
 dans peaceful consent ellen hutton leads
 ramsey along she seemingly cuts teddy
 and caps the climax by going to the ball with
 ramsey she dances all through the pro-
 gram with joe and neglects teddy

    ellen is the finest-looking girl in this
 county and her folks are in close communion
 with a bale or two of real money the man
 who marries her gets all this and toe ram-
 sey knows it and would marry her in a
 minute if he had the chance

    the point is give him the change on
 the night of the ball the whole gang assem-
 bles on the little upper balcony in the back
 

the railroad maxs magazine

the five conspirators waited patiently

of mccooks which on this gala occasion is
called the conservatory we hide behind the
ferns and crocuses and when joe ramsey
tells ellen that shes the star of his life and
all that guff we wait till slie turns him down
cold and then we jump over the rail and
each man follows his own idea of what con-
stitutes harmless amusement

   but suppose ramsey dont propose-sup-
pose he asks her before the night of the ball
-that spoils it objected chalmers

   my boy no man proposes to a woman
till the woman gets ready for him to speak
the fateful words ellen will string joe
along easy until the proper night-just keep-
in him at arms length until hes full of
music and poetry and whatever spirits mc-
cook dishes up for the occasion

   im for this scheme way down to the last
yelp chalmers announced  but i aint
goin to ask ted riordan for his consent

   you dont need to said curtis loftily
i thought this out and ill go the whole
hog ill ask ted and besides that seem
that i know ellen hutton better than any-
body here ill ask her too teddy and me
will ask her together

  the account rendered subsequently by cur-
tis of his interview with mr riordan indi-

cated that the latter ascended
in the air nine thousand feet
giving vent to emphatic ex-
pressions of annoyance on the
way up

   i appealed to him with
tears in my eyes said the
spokesman  i told him that
it would reflect credit on him
and that it would even up us
firemen and hand ramsey a
wallop hed never forget i
told him that hed earn the
undying gratitude of about
thirty firemen and that it
wouldnt be so hard for him
to stand around and watch el-
len going places with ramsey
when he knew the whole thing
was a joke and when he
thought of the big smash corn-
in to ramsey at the finish

   finally he gave in like the
good scout he is and agreed
but the time i had with ted-
dy was a mere game of domi-
noes compared with the tem-
pestuous riot we encountered
over at ellen huttons house
first she scorched me with a
few choice samples of lady sarcasm and
then she threw the prong into teddy about
eleven yards and twisted it

   but we both unbuckled the founts of our
eloquence and before we got through teddy
was arguin for mv side the same as though
he had a personal grudge against ramsey
we showed the lady that there wasnt any
particular harm in it and that she wouldnt
be called upon to do anything unladylike or
undignified that she was simply to treat
joe ramsey nice and about nine oclock at
night ellen began to smile and look cheerful
at my scheme

  will she do it asked chalmers eagerly
she will said curtis proudly there
aint anything in the way of complete suc-
cess when i told ellen what was wanted
she understood in a minute and she improved
 my scheme by suggestin little things that
id left out it takes a woman to finish up
a scheme

  or put it completely on the fritz said
fish sourly

  from the day of that announcement until
the night of the grand ball the croton valley
railroad seethed with an inward volcano

  riordan curtis allis chalmers and
fish ils the important members of the cabal
giving ramsey the ha ha



went about their coal-heaviig with the air of
men in whose bosoms reposed a tremendous
secret

  joe ramsey went about his business with
the cheerful confidence of a man who has no
care through one of those mysterious cir-
cumstances that women talk about on veran-
das when there are no men present he became
acquainted with ellen hutton

  while joe ramsey had manifested a wild
enthusiasm over particular young women his
attentions to ellen hutton mounted at once
to one hundred per cent with ten extra he
escorted her to the moving pictures as fast
as the man changed the films he pur-
chased roses for her at forty cents per rose
he sent her thoughtful gifts by messenger-
boys he hired livery rigs at one dollar an
hour he showered her with attentions until
three towns sat in their front yards in the
cool of die evening and discussed the case
with unfeigned joy

  teddy riordan took to slinking up back
streets in order to avoid sympathetic looks
he cursed the unhappy moment in which he
had given his consent to the farce

   be sure ellen said ted-
dy riordan be sure to put
that speech on thick i ell
that guy that you wouldnt
marry him in three thousand
years if there wasnt another
man on top of the world and
that he-you know what to tell
him remember ill be with
the bunch up behind the rail-
ing and after what im going
through in the way of sym-
pathy oyer losing you ill be
highly pleased with any strong
talk you hand him

   ill remember teddy but
you mustnt blame me you
know perfectly well that this
plan was yours

   it wasnt mine
retorted her affi-
anced hotly  it was
curtiss

  you came to me
with it im simply
doing as you and
mr curtis asked
and i hope youll
be pleased when its
over

   on the night of the
ball most of the trains
on the croton valley
 rr

ceased to run all the beauty and chivalry
of the community were on hand and mc-
cooks big pavilion was crowded as never
before

  teddy riordan accompanied himself and
a terrific grouch joe ramsey clad in rai-
ment that would have brought die flush of
envy to an east indian goddess sat beside a
feminine dream whose first name was ellen
fish chalmers allis and curtis came in a
group acting like criminals about to break
open a safe and by nine oclock the festivi-
ties were booming along at seventy miles an
hour

  topeka princeton and lehigh were well
represented and the eyes of all were upon
ellen hutton and joe ramsey

  that handsome pair glided about the
glazed floor and so far as casual observers
could see they were having the time of their
young lives joe smiled down into ellens
face and ellen laughed delightedly joe
spoke tenderly to ellen and ellen responded
with animation

  but oh what a wallop was coming to joe

  riordan spent the better part of the eve-
ning conversing with himself
in a low heated tone at times
there was homicide on his brow
as he beheld his future wife
slip by airily to the stiletto ca-
dence of  gee i wish i had
a girl in the arms of the
handsomest fireman  the
croton valley system he
consoled himself with the
thought of what would happen
later on when he and the fol-
lowers of the inventive curtis
were hidden in the conserva-
tory

at midnight the gay riot
came to a halt and food was
served following the repast
everybody sought se-
cluded places and
strong men talked si-
lently to their part-
ners it was that fate-
ful hour when future
marriages are un-
thinkingly made into
possibilities and the
 embers of the
scheming bund hur-
ried away from the
sandwiches and fried
crabs to the observers
gallery


the railroad mans magazine

he beheld his
future wife slip
by airily

  ellen had promised to lead ramsey to the
slaughter shortly after the supper there
was no chance of a hitch

  now whispered curtis now we get
even

  the five conspirators screened themselves
above the little room and waited patiently
below them were two rustic couches and a
sad-looking fern reposing in a washtub

  they ought to be in soon muttered
teddy riordan looking at his watch  did
any one see them begin to eat

   havent seen them since the last waltz
said fish cheerily theyll be along in a
minute

  the minutes went on merrily curtis com-
plained of pains in his legs owing to his
cramped position fish decided that he was
thirsty and departed in quest of a cooling
drink at thirty minutes past twelve chal-
mers manifested the first sifn of impatience
at one oclock curtis remarked

  i wonder what is keeping them

  the dancing was resumed and shortly
after a tall man wearing a slouch-hat and
a red beard walked into the front door of

mccooks with something in his right hand
the leader of the orchestra gazed thought-
fully at the tall man and decided that his
appearance was worthy of note he stopped
the band and silence fell upon the assem-
blage

the tall man lopked about him inquiring-
ly and blushed when he realized that he
alone was responsible for the temporary
hiatus then he spoke

is theodore riordan here he said in
hollow tones

 i am came a voice from the distance-
 i have a message for you said the tall
man in the same sepulchral voice  i was
given a letter to deliver to you any time
after one oclock

    there was a hurried rush at the
rear of the hall teddy riordan
came forward hastily followed by
fish chalmers curtis and allis

      here it is said the stranger he
   handed teddy a letter

    who-who gave it to you ted-
  dy asked faintly

 a lady and a gentleman in a motor-car
replied the messenger

mr curtis felt for a single instant that
the best thing he could do would be to slip
away he had a premonition - a terrible
premonition-but he controlled himself and
remained by teddys side the latter tore
open the envelope and read the note hurried-
ly then he dropped the letter and sank
back into the arms of chalmers

   curtis picked up the bit of paper and read

   dear teddy 

     i am sorry to have to write this joe and i
   were married to-day at noon in crestline if
   you ever can do so please forgive me it was
   the only thing for me to do because i have
   discovered since i came to know joe so well
   that i could never care for any other man
   naturally as his wife i was forced to tell
   him of mr curtiss plan for to-night and he
   insisted upon bringing tne to the ball al-
   though i would have spared you that if i
   could have done so forgive me yours truly

                         ellen ramsey

  curtis gazed about him with unseeing
eyes then he stuffed the paper in teddys
pocket and walked away the orchestra
trembled on the verge of a waltz chalmers
supported teddy riordan and fish helped
carry him to one side curtis walked slowly
out of the front door and down the road

  at the extreme edge of the hall teddy
struggled in the arms of his helpers

    wheres curtis he muttered huskilv

man against man

single deep-toned stroke from
 the clock on simon dills
 office mantel roused the old
 lawyer from a sort of reverie

     hm - m - m  half past
 five he said picking up
 his gold-rimmed glasses from the desk and
 setting them on his thin-bridged beak of a
 nose

   well-well bless me i had no idea
 it was so late agnes will be wondering
 where on earth i am ah that girl of mine-
 that girl 

he passed a hand over his high shiny
forehead and stroked down a lock of hair
white as spun wool which somehow had
 parted company with its fellows a careful
old man simon dill-careful and precise

     heigho  he yawned  i hate to go out
 into that though he glanced at the broad
 black square of the window against which
 snowflakes were sliding falling  i hate
 to but i suppose i must if im to get
 through dinner in time to address that bay
 state charitable league to-night hang
 charity anyhow he ended with a growl
  if it werent for-ah-getting the appoint-
 ment next year as trustee- eh-whos
 here now  

   he straightened up suddenly blinking
 from behind his glasses into the half dark-
 ness which lay beyond the radius of the light
 that fell over his mahogany desk a man
 had entered the office a man in a long
 snow-covered ulster a man who now stood
 looking at him with an intent and discon-
 certing gaze

    well ejaculated simon a bit testily
 he was not the sort of man this pillar of

society to be lightly or incautiously broken
in upon when musing on his past successes or
dreaming of his future ones to himself he
added

   i wont let maxwell go before i do an-
other night without him in the outer of-
fice theres no protection none whatever
why-why-anybody might come in here
and try to see me  aloud he repeated
well sir

  the man in the long coat made no reply
but came close up to the desk laid one
gloved hand on top of it set the other to his
hip and looked down steadily at dill

  he was a tall slim upstanding chap with
a pair of the most honest eyes that ever you
saw in a mans head for a long minute he
stood there just looking at the old lawyer
dill more than a trifle disconcerted with the
prescience of trouble close at hand took off
his glasses put them on again fingered his
gold watch-charm and at last as though
with cheerful spontaneity exclaimed

  why bless my soul if it isnt graham
john graham of all men well - well
john my boy what good fortune brings you
here sit down john i was-ah-just
about leaving for beacon street you know
but my times always yours take your coat
off john make yourself at home whats
new down yonder in manhattan  

  he held out his hand to the visitor a
veined and rather flabby - looking hand
with more than one stone of price glinting
on its fingers but graham ignored it
neither did he take off his coat or make any
sign of sitting down something in the pal-
lor of his face the tension of his mouth the
keen blue light in his eyes gave notice that
he had come on no friendly visit

  dill shifted uneasily in his chair and
glanced at the clock wishing himself well
away he had always regarded this young


the railroad mans magazine

man who until be had reached his majority
three years ago had been nominally his ward
with little more than the assumption of con-
descending patronage even the fact that
graham had on his class-day eve spoken
right honorably for the hand of agnes had
amused the lawyer even though at the same
time it had vexed him a trifle

  old dill had quite other plans in view
than that his only girl should marry a por-
trait painter- a mere dauber as he called
him bruskly the lawyer had sent him
about his business anxious for more than one
reason to be well rid of him

  for a year and a half he had seen nothing
of graham had heard nothing of him for
shrewd as he was agnes had been far
shrewder what girl in love but can outwit
her father in sending or receiving letters
the lawyer in a word had all but banished
graham from mind but now there stood the
man unwelcome as the devil himself gazing
down at him with a look that boded trouble
in the wind

  why john-ah-whats the matter now
my boy   the old man asked again un-
steadily many a time had he faced hostile
juries arrogant judges but never had he felt
the fear that this mute accusing look in-
spired  can it be can it possibly be -
the thought flashed to him- that he knows
at last merciful heaven if he does-what
then  

  already half in a panic he cast about him
for a channel of escape out from the dark
recesses of his mind fluttered evil memories
memories which he had hoped might never
be evoked again to cover his emotion he
fumbled for his handkerchief and loudly
blew his nose

   you scoundrel 

  what cried the old man starting half
up as though by the force of a suddenly re-
leased spring  what-whats that you say
sir 

   i said  scoundrel  answered graham
in a low steady voice

  are you deaf all of a sudden ill put
sneak-thief and hypocrite beside it and top
off with liar is that language plain and
simple enough  

  dill tried hard to laugh but it was a
ghastly mockery of merriment his face
flushed red then went sickly pale back into
his chair he sank the glasses fell from his
nose he did not pick them up but sat
there shaking as with palsy utterly unnerved
the suddenness of the attack had found him
off his guard for once he crouched and

cringed a moment rubbing his nerveless old
hands together a mean and pitiable thing

  then he looked up or tried to for his eyes
could not meet grahams

   you-youd better go home my boy he
stammered youre either deranged or-
ah-youve been drinking too much in
either case-

  graham his face a study of scorn tossed
his head up with a sneer

  no he answered i was never saner
than to-night as for your odter assumption
thats as false as your own mask of respect-
ability you hound ive come all the way
from new york just for the pleasure of say-
ing what ive said-and some more i dont
need any dutch courage to help me face any
man least of all a man like you 

  the old lawyer panic-stricken foreseeing
visions of he knew not what violence glanced
at the telephone that stood on his desk
graham saw the glance quietly he reached
over seized the instrument and set it on top
of the desk out of dills reach

  no said he you wont use that not
yet a while not till youve heard a few
things understand if you were only
thirty years younger id whale you to a pulp
before beginning but as it is no yourre
safe enough youll give me half an hour of
your valuable time though yes more if i
want it youll-

  the old man reassured that no bodily
harm was going to befall him got back a
tag-end of sneaking courage he fumbled in
his lap for his glasses put them on looked
at the clock again and stood up

   there now that will do said he  ive
heard quite enough sir quite enough after
the unwarranted insults and abuse that for
some reason or other youve seen fit to heap
on your one-time guardian and protector a
man old enough to be your father a man who
shared your fathers confidence and who-
graham laughed outright a bitter inso-
lent laugh

  why you old gray wolf he said
silence sir cried dill after such
insults rest assured that any hopes you may
ever have had regarding-ah-my daughter
-are quite futile quite so indeed
graham snapped his fingers  i guess we
dont- he began then checked himself
his powerful arms crossed on the desk-top
he stood there gazing at dill with steady and
contemptuous eyes

  the old man his own master again
shrugged his shoulders and turned away to
where his overcoat and tall silk hat hung be-
the steeled conscience



side the window graham without a word
walked to the outer door of the office locked
it and slipped the key into his pocket

   i wouldnt put those on just now if i
were you advised he  you wont be going
for a while yet you know and if you sit
here all bundled up you might catch cold on
the way home good advice eh   

  the mockery of his tone stung the lawyer

   why you insolent whelp  he cried in a
thin anger-shaken voice  youll regret this
young man youll certainly regret it you
dont know who youre dealing with thats
evident  and at graham he shook a long
big-knuckled menacing finger

  dont i hm maybe no matter
were going to settle things right here and
now sit down again before i have to make
you sit down dyou hear he repeated as
the lawyer still stood there an angry and
impotent old figure

  he pointed at the chair before the desk
dill made for a moment as though to brave
him out then yielded before the imperative
eyes and gesture of the man

  thank you said graham satirically
 i thought youd be reasonable now put
your glasses on good and solid for ive got
something to show you here have you ever
seen this  

  from an inner pocket he drew something
-a small fat leather-covered book-an old-
fashioned diary it seemed coming around
the end of the desk he threw the book down
onto the blotter where the light from above
fell strongly on it

  that cried dill aghast he sought to
catch it up but his fingers shook so that he
had to try three times before he could hold it
at all that oh merciful heaven after
all these-all these years that that

chapter ii

the old diary

graham laughed

 yes he assented  just that noth-
ing else not quite so high and mighty
now are you not quite so virtuous and
insulted old man recognize it all right
enough eh oh undoubtedly maybe i
can shuck off a little of your smooth hypoc-
risy yet like a peanut-shell and throw it
away get right down to the kernel of you
maybe-if it isnt too small and mean and
wizened-up to see without a microscope

   open the book man open it - read
a little-its interesting enough for even you

open it i say why what makes you
tremble so ah no you dont

  for the old man with a sudden furious
gesture had jerked the book open and
using all his strength was trying to tear it in
two	

  instantly graham was upon him like a
lion on a jackal grahams powerful fingers
clamped themselves round dills wrist and
tug and strive as the old lawyer might he
could not so much as budge his hands

  oh-oh-let go there you ruffian
panted dill purple with exertion and fury
youre breaking my bones i tell you
let go 

  when you let go the book not before
answered graham his voice cold as steel
dills only reply was an oath with new
struggles to tear the paper but now gra-
hams clutch tightened his fingers sunk into
the unwholesome white flesh of die lawyer
whose hands became livid and swollen

   drop diat book  exclaimed the young
man drop it before i squeeze the very
marrow out of you 

  darn you but youll smart for this
snarled the lawyer as his fingers opened
limply letting the book fall to the desk

  ill teach you to come into an old mans
office and assault him wait-youll see
graham only laughed  that may be a
game he answered  that two can play at
what youll do some time depends very large-
ly on what i do now you understand on
what i do to-morrow and the next day by
the way it isnt a bad thing to have a set of
first-class fingers is it you used to sneer
at me formy interest in athletics back in
college i believe but-well it may come in
handy once in a while no

  dillinghams only answer was an inar-
ticulate growl like that of a balked animal
as he sat rubbing and nursing his bruised
wrists

    dont try diat again please if you value
your health admonished graham quite
coolly i really advise you not to you
see i wasnt really exerting myself then
next time i might happen to forget myself
and-you never can tell what might happen
now then and his voice changed suddenly
to one of command now then if youre
quite ready to talk business why so am i
well  

    go on blackmailer  panted the lawyer
blackmailer i cried graham as-
tounded well say that is a good one
blackmailer-ha ha 

  leaning one hand on the open book he


the railroad mans magazine

clapped dill on the shoulder with the other
till the old mans head wabbled and his
glasses almost fell off again

   why my dear ex-guardian i beg your
pardon said he mockingly  among all
your other admirable qualities i really didnt
know you had that of a humorist black-
mailer eh capital a regular tu quoque
answer well spoken come lets shake hands
on the strength of that ill forgive a whole
lot for the sake of a good joke upon my
word i will 

  he extended his palm to dill but the old
man merely recoiled showed his teeth and
snarled for all the world like a trapped wild-
cat at sight of his look graham grew seri-
ous again cool collected and determined

   	oh so theres nothing doing in that line
eh asked he very well well go on
a basis of absolute hostility if you say so
now this book here this book-

    well this book what of it fool   spat
the lawyer  wherever you found it i dont
know but no matter about that there it is
i recognize it your fathers diary yes
what of it what are you going to do with
it now youve got it what i say

  ah now that answered graham is
the most interesting part of all dont you
wish you knew you old badger better ask
what am i not going to do with it i guess
youve got sort of an idea what im going to
do-unless you do w-hat im going to ask
you and do it first-do it quick a nice
position itll put you in too a truly eminent
position pillar of society and all that sort
of thing you know just shovel out the
foundations with this little book and  oh
what a fall was there my countrymen  i
hope you understand me sir 

  what cried dill have you no
shame no sense of decency when my
daughter hears of this from me-

  youll oblige me by not mentioning her
here if you please exclaimed the younger
man with sudden heat if she hears of it
at all it wont be my fault whatever hap-
pens shell be spared that so far as im
concerned heaven forbid that i should
cause her a seconds pain even-even for all
this means to me

   be wise i tell you come down while
theres time give in make good i have
no wish to take an old man and dangle him
before the public as a symbol of dishonor
much as i despise and loathe you dill im
going to keep this thing all dark if youll
be reasonable a  ittle for your sake one
per cent maybe ninety-nine per cent for

her now you know where i stand well
how about it

  he drew back from the desk folded his
arms and quite patiently quite calmly wait-
for the old mans answer but if he expected
the astute lawyer to give in for any such
reason he had misjudged him

  so then whined dill fumbling with
his glasses to give himself a measure of self-
control  so then you use her as a whip to
beat me with you-

  not at all replied graham i just
put it up to you in a straightforward man-
ner do you or dont you value that money
more than you do your own good name and
your daughters peace of mind do you
choose a quiet settlement or do you prefer a
scandal and a yellow-journal campaign
with all that that means now thatsthe
question before the house 

    that book curse it fumed the lawyer
evading the issue  if it hadnt been for
that why i thought that was sunk in the
bottom of lake barlee forty years ago along 
with-

  he checked himself but graham had
caught the hint

    along with the rest of my fathers things
all except the dust you mean asked he in
a tone of such bitter and contemptuous scorn
that even the time - hardened old rascal
winced

   you thought i suppose that nobod- in
this world would ever know what happened
at dundas hill eh that the solemn oath
you swore there to use my fathers share of
the strike for my bringing-up and to hand
me the principal when i was twenty-one
wouldnt ever come to light that when you
sailed away from fremantle in that old
three-masted windjammer the pandora and
saw the coast of australia sink dow-n behind
the horizon youd left every decency and
obligation buried deeper than your partners
corpse ugh you swine 

  dill leered up malevolently at him gone
now was every pretense and sham the mans
face had changed new lines seemed to have
formed in it his eyes glittered like a cor-
nered rats eyes and like a rats whiskers
too twitched his gray mustache his shiny
forehead was all beaded with sweat his
teeth as he tried to speak clattered together
uncannily

   you-you cant- he managed to stam-
mer 	 -

  cant what cant prove it you-jwan
oh i cant eh well maybe i cantprove
that somehow or other you made wav with
the steeled conscience



my father poisoned him or something for
the dust but no matter about that im
morally certain a strong vigorous man such
as he was didnt die out diere without some
help from you and that sort of certitude is
sometimes better than proof i cant prove
you were bushwhacking either but ill just
let that pass

   what i can prove and will too if your
regard for-for agnes isnt strong enough
now to bring you to time is that all these
years and years youve-the money i mean
hang you-the money-and-

  graham his self-control slipping away in
spite of him became half incoherent he
shook the old tattered diary in dills ghastly
face

   i dont want to prove anything else dont
want to know for her sake  the young man
rushed on  but by heaven the thing i
do know has got to be made right or-well
you just refuse thats all and see what drops
on you just try and see

   sh-h-h sh-h-h not so loud  entreat-
ed dill glancing about him in a frightened
way all his aplomb and dignity quite van-
ished

  for heavens sake be reasonable just
think what might happen if somebody out
there in the corridor should happen to over-
hear you sh-h-h keep your voice down
thats a good fellow  and he raised a thin
clawlike tremulous haijd appealingly

   oh very well-as you say answered
graham pulling himself together with a
strong effort  ive got some common sense
left even yet i guess though when i first
found that book in the old hair trunk that
father sent home just before you and he
started into the bush-when i found it in
the attic at greenwood well-i saw red for
a minute

   its a good thing for you all right that
you werent there just then however thats
over and gone now im no fool to wreck my
life and hers with any such cheap spectacu-
lar business as revenge its justice i want
now and mean to have and am going to get
hear me justice-nothing more nothing
less thats all now things are up to you
well what say your move

   but -and the old man forced a laugh
through his pallid lips- but after all these
forty years more or less-bah you cant
prove it it wont hold in law now its not
actionable 

  oh it isnt eh well look at this will
you and this and this 

  with trembling fingers he spread the old

time-yellowed leaves wide open on the desk
thumbed them over and found a certain

place

  read that he commanded tapping the

page

         chapter iii

   the gray wolf bares his fangs

 ead it quavered dill unstrung by
the actual presentation there before
his eyes of the dim writing traced so many
years ago so many thousand miles away by
a dead hand-the hand of a man who could
the departed speak must so bitterly have
cursed him

  read it i cant

  his voice sank almost to a whisper as he
sat there sick and shaken not with remorse
but with an agony of fear fear at thought
of losing now the golden hoard which all
these years had been his crowning joy-fear
at the prospect of exposure of disgrace
fear-nothing else

   i said read  dictated graham again
 there-right there 

  a moments silence while the old mans
eyes sought the place and while the faded
letters almost illegible in places where the
ink had changed seemed to dazzle on his
sight

  the busy clock on the mantel still kept
on its cheery tock-tick-tock against the win-
dow the snow still sifted down from out-
side in the corridor came a rattle as an ele-
vator door slammed shut somewhere a
whistle blew in the distance others followed
high-pitched or low and the clock with a
sudden buzzing struck six times

  well why dont you do as i say com-
manded graham sharply

  the lawyer as if rousing from a sort of
stupor focused his blinking eyes and read

              fremantle december  

     in at last after three weeks of hades
  luck so far but still at it  d is very
  hopeful says we must surely strike it if we
  leave the coast and head for the country over
  back of glenelg and the yilgarn hills he
  may be right he always seems to be in every-
  thing he says or does one in a thousand
  dill is    at any rate nothing in the
  north country yarra-yarra and the gairder
  range havent shown us a sparkle of the yel-
  low stuff    im not feeling quite myself
  these days seem to be losing strength some-
  how though why i cant say asked d
  about it this morning he said he felt the
  same way too but i never saw him looking


the railroad mans magazine

  better very cheerful hes been of late
  astonishingly so considering our infernal
  luck without him what would i do   
  god grant everything is right at home with
  clara and the boy my son he must be
  over a year old now yes a year and two
  months-and to think ive never even seen
  him-never had but four letters from clara in
  all this time wretched service abominable
  down to this corner of the world what a
  place for a man to be but anything every-
  thing if luck only favors and i can do the
  things what i want to do for them both
  heaven knows this hardship isnt suffered for
  my own sake   

   there now enough for that directed
graham now see here he turned a
dozen pages  this said he dill read

               kilgoorlie january  

    struck it at last by heaven rich oh
  beyond the wildest dreams the stuff lies
  thick for half a mile all up and down a little
  unnamed brook draining into lake lefroy
  no digging just cradle it right out of the
  shining sand    the buckskin bags are
  heavier heavier each evening oh such suc-
  cess if only clara knew now she and the
  little chap are safe whatever happens   

  i feel singularly weak it seems to me con-
  tinual headache sometimes nausea after eat-
  ing if it werent for dill now id be lost
  he keeps well    sometimes i seem to
  have forebodings    but if anything hap-
  pens hell stand by with such a man to
  leave things to trust clara and the boy to
  why need i fear a truer comrade never
  breathed    ah this cursed land of
  deserts hills maddening sunshine drought
  what wouldnt i give for just one sight of the
  states again-of them    next week
  after the clean-up here we leave for the east
  murchison fields beyond lake bailee and
  spinifex great things hoped for-greater
  still then-

  go on graham ordered for the old
man blinking and stammering hesitated
and made as though to stop

  go on now-ah-be reasonable cant
you asked dill in his cracked voice
sounded an undertone as though of returning
courage almost of jubilation how can
i read dont you see for yourself its al-
most illegible faded so-and dimmer dim-
mer the farther it goes

  he turned a few pages more the writing
toward the end of the book became in fact
not only weaker and more irregular but so
pale that only here or there a word appeared
at all the lawyers eyes sparkled with se-
cret joy

  no one knew better than he how much de-

pended on this fact it gave him fresh hope
new stamina but he was far too wise to
voice his thought-the thought that after all
graham might not know the whole truth in
all its blackness-the size of the fortune he
had been robbed of the actual status of af-
fairs too old he in the usages of plot and
counter-plot in the finesses of deception to
have lost hope even yet so with sudden in-
spiration he looked up at graham and with
a voice seemingly tinged by the honest vibra-
tions of remorse asked

   why go on  why after all  i am an
old man youre young lifes still before
you its mostly all behind me suppose now
that i should-ah-consent to your marrying
agnes would-

   would i drop this shylock   cried gra-
ham   my daughter o my ducats o
my daughter   he quoted scornfully  so
thats your much-boasted love for her eh
faugh dont you ever say a thing like that
again to me you hear never what
would you trade and barter the girl like -a
kaffir selling a fatted daughter for so many
cattle  you outrageous cur 

   but-wait-hear me  exclaimed the
lawyer a flush mounting to his withered
cheeks despite him you misunderstand
suppose at the same time that i-ah-ad-
mit you know-

  admit what else can you do but ad-
mit it youve got to

   admit resumed the lawyer bowing his
head and secretly cursing his inability to
squeeze a tear from his dry eyes-a tear that
might drop effectively on the blurred page
 own the wrong repent a great word
that repent-ah never too late for grace
my young friend however black the sin
never too-

  cut that graham snapped i dont
want any of your driveling cant this time
ive heard too much of that-far too much-
already im here to deal with facts to-night
not hypocritical speculations suppose i
drop any action against you-not for your
sake mind but hers-what then  

  then why restitution certainly cer-
tainly my dear fellow restitution in full 
exclaimed dill his heart swelling with a sud-
den crafty joy  the original sum of
course was-i mean you know its in bonds
at present all secure the very best trust
me for that and with a chuckle he
rubbed his hands together  bonds in my
safe with your permission ill show you
eh   he nodded at the massive safe that
stood in the far corner of the office
the steeled conscience	

  go on get them lets see them bade
graham its a dirty business at best i
hate to touch or even see them its like taking
blood-money-but its mine and im going
to have it if it wasnt for agnes i swear
to you id have satisfaction out of you too
youd go up for this so help me-but my
hands are tied by her thank her for that
go on bring them lets see the cursed
things

  dill stood up adjusted his glasses and
walked slowly over to the corner in his
devious brain a plan had formed-was form-
ing even now every seconds respite was
precious as diamonds to him if he could
only hold the young man there a little while
parley with him delay him he felt that all
might yet be well

  never had he faced a judge or jury when
one-hundredth part so much had been at
stake for him as now he realized that this
was a supreme crisis in his life that every
atom of his craft would have to come into
play if he were to win out

  to his head he pressed a hand and stood
there a moment before the safe thinking-
thinking with feverish haste

  well go on graham cried why
dont you open it

  wait-wait just a minute please
quavered dill  the combination-ah-all
this unpleasantness has quite driven it out of
my mind just a minute youll grant me
wont you  

   think away but mind you i havent
got all night to waste on you 

  dill leered craftily to himself his back
turned toward graham silently to himself
he mouthed a curse then his plan full-
fledged knelt before the safe with lean
fingers he spun the knob stopped it turned
it back again and once more reversed the
wards clicked he tugged at the handle
the heavy door swung outward

   presently presently  he exclaimed a
glance over his shoulder assured him that the
young man still stood beside the desk and
that from there he could not see the interior
of the safe

  certain of this much he quietly unlocked
and pulled out a lower drawer in it lay a
blue-barreled revolver fully loaded with
a dexterity that would have done credit to
hermann he slid this into his breast-pocket
then shut the drawer again and locked it

  no not there said he let me see
now where did i put them last this dis-
cussion has quite upset me bless my soul
but it has 

  graham exasperated almost to the limits
of endurance stepped over to him

  none of that now he exclaimed
 that wont go with me you know come
produce them i havent any time to lose
you hear 

   why how impatient we are to be sure 
retorted dill his courage strengthening
every second now  surely you wouldnt
hurry an old man-old enough to be-

   ill give you just two minutes by that
clock graham interrupted after that
-well i wont guarantee anything if i
did the right thing by you-hmmm-go on
anyhow get them

  dill opened another drawer from it he
lifted a large packet wrapped in lawyers
tape and sealed with wax

  ah here we are  he exclaimed getting
up painfully from the carpet and dusting off
the knees of his well-creased trousers now
then and bowing to graham he ges-
tured toward the desk

  graham turnedback toward it automat-
ically obeying the suggestion a man less
clever and astute than dill might easily have
shot him but such was in nowise the old
mans game he knew a dozen tricks to beat
that all that he wanted for the moment
was just to get grahams eyes off him and
as graham turned dill stepped backward
beside the safe his arm went out his
hand sought and found the little knob of a
messenger - call instantly he punched the
knob then close behind the young man
came over to his chair again

  he sat down graham stood beside him
his face was pale his eyes were like twin
blue fires

   better draw up a chair here and make
yourself comfortable while we settle things
hadnt you   queried the lawyer with mock
hospitality

  graham made no answer save  go on
open them 

   in a minute-ah-certainly yes yes in-
deed said dill now sparring for eveiy sec-
onds time  lord bless me but theyre
tightly sealed though  and he made as
though to break the wax but before he did
so he looked up again

  the amount asked he really now
my dear young man you havent-that is the
amount you know  

  so forgotten have you sneered
graham mind im not asking for a pen-
nys interest i dont believe in it anyhow
and i wouldnt take it from you if i did
just the original money thats all the sum


the railroad mans magazine

you took from my father and promised on
your word of honor-as though you had any
-to give my mother just that not one cent
more well  

  the lawyer sweating now with a soul-
racking eagerness to hold graham off for
just a few minutes more took up the diary
again turned the pages toward the end and
seemed as though seeking to refresh his mem-
ory but all the writing there traced in a
mere scrawl had faded so that it was nearly
undecipherable

  the last few pages as he thumbed them
over showed only a pot-hook here and there
dills face hardened

   so then is that all youve got to show 
he queried in assumed solicitude  but
really my dear boy-

   oh you cant dodge that way cried
graham holding his temper only with an
effort he fumbled in his pocket again
pulled out a flat package ripped it open and
tossed down onto the desk a score or so of
photographic prints

   there look at those  commanded he
dill took them up and with deliberation
studied one or two

   you-youve-but how the deuce man  
he blurted for the instant startled out of his
self-assurance for on each print appeared
a page of the diary and its writing though
uneven as if done by a feeble hand was per-
fectly legible

  nothing simpler answered graham
oh i thought it all out in advance never
fear i simply used a common method took
a half-dozen films of each page laid them
together and printed through a knowledge
of photography isnt such a bad thing after
all eh yes dill ive got the goods on you
this time see there for instance read
that

  he tapped one of the prints the lawyer
amazed yet still intent on using every possi-
ble moment of time read slowly

            murchison february  

    i know now that the end is near d is
  all kindness and encouragement he tells me
  i shall be myself again once we get out of this
  blazing gehenna but i know better some-
  thing tells me i never shall get out    well
  a man can do no more than meet the inevita-
  ble bravely thank god the end has not
  drawn near without my having at least won
  a prize-what a prize we weighed out the
  dust yesterday last night crouching in the
  tent by lantern-light four hundred and sixty
  thousand dollars so far between us my
  share then two hundred and thirty thousand
  dollars what will clara say when d gives

 her that    for he has given his word
 and his hand to it that he will faithfully
 carry out my wishes-look out for the wife
 and the little chap-assume-

 dill broke off sharply in the corridor
 sounded the opening the closing of an ele-
 vator steps came quickly along the hall-
 way

  go on  commanded graham

 dill in a gasping nervous sort of voice
 resumed

 -the guardianship and the protection of-

 a hand fumbled at the knob of the outer
 office door graham with an exclamation
 of impatience half turned toward it then
 he remembered that the door was locked and
 that the key lay safely in his pocket

 never you mind about that said he
 angrily

 but dill this time did not obey

 some one was rapping was shaking the
 door

  say are you going to read or not  
 cried graham

 dill suddenly defiant stood up over
 into the back of the desk he swept the diary
 and the prints

 in grahams face he snapped his fingers
 then with a loud voice shouted

 not one cent you dastardly blackmailer
 kill me if you will but not a penny-not
 one 

  you mean- began graham flushing
 with passion

 help help screamed dill throwing
 into the cry a shrill note as of deadly terror

 and before graham could move or speak
 a word he flashed out from his pocket the
 revolver

 graham saw it and struck out but not
 before the lawyer had pulled the trigger not
 at graham though dill shot only straight
 down at the floor

 the explosion crackled and rang trebly
 loud in the confined space

 help oh hes-lies killing me
 roared dill as graham closed with him
 other footsteps clattered along the hall
 then came a crashing of glass a thun-
 derous shock against the door afid in burst
 staggering the elevator-man behind him
 pale and staring peered a blue-clad messen-
 ger-boy

 help here murder howled the law-
 yer

 a sudden weight flung itself on grahams
 broad neck
the steeled conscience



  graham dill and the elevator-man all
went down together by the desk in a fighting
tangle

       chapter iv
       whipsawed by fate

tvtaddened beyond any human limits
of endurance graham wrenched him-
self free and staggered up but again the
elevator - man came at him with his fists
swinging

  graham ducked the blow and landed hard
on the mans jaw driving him back an
instant but now dill was up with sur-
prising strength for so old a man the lawyer
snapped the messenger-bov round by the
shoulder cried  run police  and sent
him flying toward the door then into
his pocket he crammed the diary and the
photographs graham caught a glimpse of
this of the old man striking his own face
twice thrice with all the force of his clenched
fist but beyond this instantaneous glance
he had no time to notice anything for now
the elevator-man mad clear through and
lusting for battle drove at him again

  graham tried to parry but his long wet
ulster hampered him he dodged back
stumbling over something dill kicked his
shins viciously before he could pull to-
gether the irishman had landed a bone-
breaking upper-cut graham fell his head
went crack against the corner of the desk

  here hold on he tried to cry let
me explain-

  but suddenly everything seemed to spin
round and round the light dazzled in his
eyes everything got black a roaring filled
his ears all that he knew was that some-
thing brutal had him by the throat-that
he could not breathe-that all his strength
was ebbing ebbing-that his lungs hurt him
savagely then-nothing

  consciousness dawned again with the feel-
ing of some hard cold substance on his
wrists

  feebly he blinked his eyes open still try-
ing to understand just what had happened
just what it was that hampered his move-
ments he sought to move his hands but
could not he swallowed hard it hurt him
cruelly his throat was lame and sore and
bruised and through his head shot brutal
pains on his forehead something warm
and sticky seemed to be crawling-something
that half-blinded him

  i-i-let me explain- he stammered

again thickly an oath and coarse laughter
answered him he felt himself being raised
and shaken by the arm then all at once
he perceived that he was standing limply in
the middle of the office hands manacled
with a couple of policemen gripping hold of
him as though their very lives depended on
the flesh-bruising intensity of their hold
one of them had a night-stick raised

  well dyouse want any more gibed
he  if youse do sure an i can give it to ye
good an plenty or will youse coom along
now an make no more throuble hey speak
up or by heaven ill give youse somethin to
loosen yer tongue 

  graham not fully sensing as yet just
what had befallen turned on the man as
though to answer but the other cried avv
cut it out and shook him roughly a
voice said

   i think hell go now all right enough
but-ah-bless my soul-what a beast on
my word man in all the years ive-ah-
dealt with crime ive never seen his equal
he-

  you lie darn you cried graham
 you- but a big fist shoved into his face
choked further utterance graham vaguely
conscious of a growing crowd in the office
of eager and wide-eyed faces peering at him
as though from a great distance of a buzz
of conflicting voices lapsed into silence he
closed his blood-clogged eyes and stood there
limp sagging as in a horrible nightmare

  you see for yourselves he heard dills
voice go on just-ah-take note now
will you  my clothes torn face bruised in
three places where he hit me and the bullet-
hole in the carpet here where he shot at me
if i hadnt been quick and wrenched his
wrist aside hed have struck me dead right
at my own desk a brutal cold-blooded and
premeditated assault he of all men my
former-

  his own-gun panted graham for-
cing his eyes open more he fired it
himself i never-

   shut up  roared the fatter of the two
policemen

    stand back you  cried the other driv-
ing the crowd out toward the door wat
business youse got here  git out 

  roughly he pushed the curiositv-seekers
back through them came elbowing another
policeman purple-faced and short of breath
bursting with self-importance

  ah lieutenant dill exclaimed glad
youre here a bad case-very

  as though exhausted he sat down heavily


the railroad mans magazine

in his chair and leaned his head on his left
hand the right he extended to the new-
comer

   i congratulate you-ah-on the splen-
did sendee of your men here said he

 without them this fellow would have mur-
dered me in cold blood here in my own of-
fice ill bear them in mind flaherty-yes
and you too bless my soul but im glad to
see you diough 

   flaherty foreseeing rich visions from the
gratitude of a man so closely bound with
corporate interests and politically so potent
puffed up even more

  public duty sir thats all he an-
swered twirling his red mustache

  hold him fast men youll make a
charge sir

   dill pointed at his self-bruised features
then at the disordered room the torn clothes
of the elevator-man who stood brushing him-
self near at hand and finally at the scorched
hole in the carpet he nodded toward the
open safe

  to-morrow morning ill appear against
him he answered till then- and he
finished with a wave of his hand toward the
door

    run him in bvs  commanded the lieu-
tenant

   the two policemen jerking graham rough-
ly started away with him the young man
caught a glimpse of himself in a mirror that
hung between the windows for an instant
he could not realize that it was himself he
saw his hair disheveled and blood-stif-
fened his forehead smeared with blood one
eye blacked his throat swollen-he made a
hideous and grotesque appearance

  oh he cried desperately hold on
-wait he-he fired the-shot i only
wanted-

   dill stood up suddenly and interrupted
his halting utterance with

  you hear if that isnt insanity or
worse id-ah-like to know what it is
the old man still shaking and trembling
seemed to grow black with indignation

  mark well lieutenant what he says
every word 

  the crowd jostling and surging grow-
ing momentarily greater all down the cor-
ridor set up a jeer graham heard catcalls
and derision twisting around in the grip
of the officers he faced the many-headed
beast at it he shook his manacled fists

  he did it i tell you he cried i
never saw the pistol in my life till he drew
it on me 

  dill laughed then-a mocking and inhu-
man laugh

  search him he snapped curtly

  flaherty stepped to grahams side into
the ulster pockets he slid his hand he
fumbled a second then drew out a key

  there see that exulted dill
 locked the door you notice so thered be
no interference 

  faix an it was locked spoke up the
elevator-man proud of his momentary im-
portance  i had t bust her in so i did
he gestured at the shattered panels

  the lieutenant nodded smiled and
slipped the key into his pocket  exhibit
a all right said he

  then he went on with his search while
the crowd gawked and pushed

  graham head up dazed senses only half
pulled together as yet stood unresistingly
when suddenly he jerked back in alarm

  what what he shouted

  flaherty had drawn from the right-hand
ulster-pocket a blue revolver its barrel was
fouled flaherty spun the cylinder one
cartridge had been exploded

    sure i guess that settles you  laughed
he exhibit b-oh yes youre done
me buck come on now bys - off wid
him

  why he-he must have put it in there
himself shouted graham beginning to
tug and strain at his bonds once more now
wholly maddened

   but dill with a sneer turned to flaherty

  you see for yourself asked he do
your duty-clear this office-take your pris-
oner youll see me in the morning at the
station-house

  clubs menacingly in air the policemen
drove die crowd like sheep out into the hall
and along it with diem they dragged
graham still struggling while the onlook-
ers gibed and hooted-some seeming to find
humor in the situation

   the office was clear at last and the bro-
ken door shut nobody now remained in-
side but dill flaherty and the elevator-
man

  oh you said dill  i mustnt-ah
-forget you my brave fellow courageous
-very 

  from his wallet he drew a thick fold of
bills skinned off a yellowback hesitated re-
placed it and took a v this lie handed
to the irishman

  there there you neednt thank me my
man he hastily exclaimed its i that
ought to thank you ill remember you-
the steeled conscience



later only for you where mightnt i be
now an excellent chap this he added to
flaherty while the man intensely flattered
threw out his chest and squared his shoul-
ders

   we mustnt forget him by any means
eh hell be my chief witness of course
youll take his name

  the lieutenant nodded brought out his
note-book and wrote down the mans name
and address

  now said he youse can go just re-
member how it all was and kape a close
mouth and youll be all right-see he
winked at the irishman who thankfully
withdrew

  now thenr said dill suppose we go
inside he pointed toward the inner of-
fice flaherty and he locked themselves in
both men sat down

  bless my soul ejaculated the lawyer
as though trying to collect himself there
was-ah-there was a messenger-bov too
well have to have him he swabbed his
forehead which was really sweaty

  ill locate him sir never fear

   then the key the pistol-and look here
will you  here and here  

  he pointed at the bruises on his face then
exhibited his wrists still discolored by gra-
hams crushing grasp

  faith but he was the divil an all
wasnt he exclaimed flaherty genuinely
impressed

  dill nodded

   i hate-ah-to admit it he answered
but-the facts you know the facts and
too that bullet-hole there-

  he glanced slyly at flaherty as the lieu-
tenant knelt to examine the perforation
then he reached for the telephone rang up
his house and told the maid to inform his
daughter that a little unpleasantness had oc-
curred but that it was nothing serious and
that he had taken no harm above all he
commanded that agues should not worry
he could explain everything he said in a
few minutes when he reached home

  for nearly half an hour the lieutenant
stayed with dill reporters knocked in vain
none were admitted all had to content
themselves with hearsay and the wreckage of
the outer door they made the most of the
material at hand

  dill was late at the meeting of the bay
state charitable league his face was black
and blue in three places and his wrists
swollen but the society had never listened
to a finer or more humanitarian speech they

applauded it to the echo rumors of the
trouble had already begun to leak out and
dill received a score of solicitous inquiries
as well as great praise for his nerve and
splendid courage nearly every paper in the
city realizing the news value of the speech
at such a time covered the meeting

  long before it had broken up john
graham had been booked at the lagrange
street station the police-reporters cov-
ered that too on the blotter they read the
entry assault with a deadly weapon with
intent to kill

  newspaperdom licked its lips simon dill
lawyer capitalist philanthropist politician
on the one hand on the other a protege of
his an artist a harvard man with a charge
against him that according to the statute-
book might mean twenty years in charles-
town-what more could the men of pad
pencil and imagination long for

  wires buzzed on the case that night and
typewriters clattered about it in the rookeries
that pass for newspaper offices along wash-
ington street the linotypes slug by slug
clacked out all that was known or surmised
or-invented life activity joyful antici-
pation there

  but on the edge of his bunk in a dark
cell john graham sat all night long his
battered wounded head gripped between his
hands

  in his heart the blood had turned to gall
into his mind had been beaten a knowledge
an understanding of some things that not all
of us are given to know with these too
a scalding bitterness beside which fire is cool
and aloes nectar

  the long pale winter dawn grayed
through the bars of the station at last but
still he sat there motionless

  twenty years he breathed chokingly
twenty years my god it may be
twenty years and i-i have-no proof no
witness-nothing  twenty years  

  before him rose a vision of agnes whom
now he felt he had irretrievably lost -
agnes as he had seen her last sweet gra-
cious kind and through his clenched fin-
gers the tears trickled slowly falling upon
the cold stone floor

        chapter v
        doubts unsatisfied

parly next morning graham was taken
to police headquarters there despite
his futile protests he was  mugged  and


the railroad mans magazine

had his bertillons taken as well as his
finger-prints-three sets the first individual
impressions of the thumb and left-hand fin-
gers the other two simultaneous impressions
of the finger-tips of both hands

  the preliminary hearing before police
judge sweeny was very brief graham
ghastly bruised and broken merely had to
face dill for a few minutes the old law-
yer testified remarkably well for a man with
the indications of having been manhandled
that he had to convey sweeny took but
little evidence before stating that probable
cause existed and that graham was bound
over to the superior court to await the action
of the grand jury he fixed the bail at
 in default of which he committed
graham to charles street jail the old
lawyer bowed and took his leave

  graham that forenoon had two visitors
from the bottom of his heart he was thank-
ful that his mother was not living to suffer
the shock and horror of this tragedy the
blow he felt would certainly have killed
her

  im alone in the world anyhow theres
that to be grateful for he said through the
bars to martin stone the first of his callers
you old man-i hope you arent going to
mix up in this thing and queer yourself for
me

  thats just precisely what i came for
tad stone answered with a smile  i igot
just one peek at this thing on the herald
square bulletin-boards last night after the
show rushed ethel and her mother home
in cqd time jumped the midnight and
made marathon time to the hub i dont
know the ins or outs of this and i dont
want to yet all i know is that youre
in bad and that my place is here i guess
thats enough for now 

  graham bowed his head against the iron

  i-i cant let you said he brokenly
 just because we roomed together at stough-
ton thats no reason you should wreck your
-you understand-future in the law and
-all that

  rot ejaculated martin im your
counsel now by right of eminent determi-
nation even though i might as well tell
you i dont believe i can scare up the bail
i can get on the job and stay there till we
have whats-his-name beaten to a fine froth
no you neednt go into any details not just
yet im going to wait till you pull together
a bit before we get down to business

   i know him and i know you and thats
all i need for the present you just tie to

me thats all the only thing im sorry
for is that the grand jury wont sit for a
couple of weeks yet youll walk out of
here a free man once it does but till then
of course- a fortnights nothing though
buck up

  graham stretched out a shaking hand but
the guard motioned it back stone laughed
in the mans face

   oh afraid ill hand him a file or a
bottle of peter or something are you he
queried desperate pair of crooks we are
eh then to graham

  now tad you just sit tight and dont
think dont try to figure this thing out
im here and thats enough if i do say it
two with the right on their side can lick-
but there that sounds like moralizing so ill
cut it im off now to see barnard up in
pemberton square well both be in this
pm so-long and keep your lip stiff dont
talk good-by all this will come out in
the wash-you wait and see with a
buoyant laugh a hearty wave of the hand he
was gone

  an hour later agnes came

  john-boy-oh what-what does this
mean   was all that she could manage to
say at first as she stood there holding to the
bars a brown chiffon veil hid her face
but only too well did graham know her
voice her figure her slim gloved hands

  you here exclaimed he staring at
her you

  dont she pleaded he mustnt
know i got out this morning in the motor
shopping promised i-wouldnt-you un-
derstand left edwards with the machine
waiting outside a drug-store two blocks away
went out a side door-came here-mustnt
stop more than five minutes cant but
tell me-

  graham steadied himself stepped close up
to the grill and in an even voice said

    listen 

  yes yes

   something terrible has happened some-
thing i never thought of or foresaw-some-
thing i never so much as dreamed could
happen no not what you think though
not that

   but what then he-

  i understand of course thats quite
natural but remember-and now im going
to give you straight talk as though you were
a man-remember that so far youve heard
only one side seen only one-just one
naturally-r

    so then you didnt 
the steeled conscience



  no not what you think i did its
hard for me to stand here and say that your
father-your father-

  the girl nodded this is straight talk
now john said she her voice had be-
come almost inaudible john saw her
tremble

  yes well then you havent got the
facts not as they were i-he-

  go on tell me for heavens sake
all im praying for now is just a chance to
believe you 

   youre getting all wrought up little girl
this isnt right its making you suffer
you-

   go on

  well i did go there then to ask for-
ask for-

  money groaned the girl

  yes

   so its true then after all  oh 
not as you think it i had a right to
ask it - no i cant tell you - not just
yet

  cant you tell me john her voice
took on a different timbre graham felt the
note of unwilling suspicion he writhed
but held his impulses in check better a
thousand times he thought to wait for the
vindication which martin had assured him
of than of his own accord to fling back
accusation at the father of the girl he loved
he bit his tongue to keep back the words that
were crowding for utterance

  you locked the door asked agnes
presently

  graham nodded  i had to answered
he  had to otherwise lie wouldnt have
listened

  you threatened him

  not with force merely with- he
would have said exposure but that word
too he checked

  not with force repeated agnes in-
credulously graham saw that inch by inch
her faith in him was ebbing out as the tide
ebbs on a sandy shore

  not with force why did you strike
him then why did you strike him an
old man-my father  

  i strike him but-

   his face proves it 

  the prisoner groaned to him flashed
the remembrance of how dill himself with
clenched fist had done that damage but
at the same time he realized the futility the
utter absurdity of asking the girl to believe
it so all he said was just

  no agnes i never struck him im as

innocent of that so help me god as of the
charge itself thats brought against me i
cant explain just now cant for your
own sake you must just take my word
believe me trust me if you cant do that
then theres no use my telling anything
more

  instinctively he felt that his appeal did
not convince that rather she took it as a
sign of weakness perhaps of guilt he
passed a hand over his maimed face as
though to hide it from her questioning eyes
behind that veil which shut her away from
him

  you dont-you cant believe me he
questioned wearily

  how about the bruises on his wrists
she queried evading him  the pistol  the
shot  

   i had to hold his hands thats all said
graham  he was going to tear up-some-
thing something of great value to me-to
us

  what was it

  graham struggled to keep himself from
bursting out with the truth with damning
accusations which now he knew could do
no good could not be proved could only
harm the girl and cause her suffering

   i cant tell you - yet he answered
some time-when im free not now

   it must have been a thing of very great
value indeed said she slowly in a tone that
voiced more loudly than any words her grow-
ing incredulity of enormous value to
have made you shoot oh how could
you-you-do a cowardly thing a brutal
thing like that when i think of it-

  agnes

  she did not answer but drew away from
the bars and turned as though to go

   listen to me  he commanded sternly
bracing himself against the sickness that all
at once leaped through him made him sweat
and tremble as he realized her thought

  listen now that pistol i swear to you
by-by all weve ever been to each other by
my honor by yours-i swear i never saw it
in my life till your father drew it on me
he fired it himself down at the floor he-

  but agnes with a cry exclaimed

  no no impossible dont ask me to
believe such absurdities what when i
come here hoping praying you can explain
willing to be convinced eager to be you tell
me things like these you give no expla-
nation you-

  explain god help me-i-i cant-
without-

  she shook her head and started to move
away john heard her breath catch as though
the tears were starting

   only believe me trust me  he ex-
claimed  some day i can tell you tell you
everything-youll understand 

  till then good-by her voice came
to him as from a long long distance half
maddened he dashed himself against the
steel slid sank to his knees on the stone
pavement and remained there his hands
clutching the bars all but fainting

  an iron door clanged agnes fias gone

  with a sharp prod in the ribs a guard
roused graham and then when he had stag-
gered to his feet thrust him back into the
corridor leading to the cells

  a warder led him away trembling and
dazed with a slam and a grating of metal
he was locked in his cell once more

chapter vi
 buried

tn spite of martin stones brave optimism
- and all the activities of barnard the
grand jury at its sitting reported an indict-
ment and placed the case on the trial-list of
the superior court of suffolk county stone
had never been admitted to the massachu-
setts bar and could act only as an adviser
and a stimulus to barnard

  though barnard when in the law school
had once chummed with both stone and
graham and was therefore now prepared to
try every expedient for the release of his
friend and though few lawyers of the
younger generation in boston were equipped
with greater shrewdness or skill yet the fact
that he stood on the wrong side of the po-
litical fence militated against him

  he was blocked harassed and in devious
hidden ways impeded for dill stood as
right as he did wrong with the hidden
forces of the citys life and where he could
pull one string the opposition could draw
in a handful so graham his reputation
now shriveled and blighted by the scorchings
of the press continued in jail waiting for
trial at the april term

  agnes did not come again after the first
fever of notoriety died down almost no-
body except stone and barnard came and
stone could visit him but once a week or
so when he could get away from business

  he was arraigned before judge mccaf-
ferty in the vast gloomy county court-house
jn pemberton square on january 

and went through the formality of pleading
not guilty after that nothing to look for-
ward to till the trial itself should come with
the tedious maddening passage of the in-
terminable days winters snow gave place
to the slush and mud of spring the elms on
the common began to burst forth into leaf
as the sun day by day rose higher the spar-
rows twittered courted nested by thousands
in the tall trees of kings chapel church-
yard  easter came and went with its message
of the years new life but still he waited

  newspaperdom forgot him for a while
there was nothing of public interest now in
the high-bred keen-nerved sensitive man
caged up like a zoologiqal specimen fed on
swill subjected-even with no crime proved
against him even with the legal assumption
of his innocence intact-to the base rule of
institutionalized hulks of humanity coars-
ened in every fiber beyond all possibility of
heart or feeling beyond all tilings save low
and petty despotism

  the world forgot him-but he did not
forget the world or dill or the real reason
of his being there forget does one for-
get a branding-iron white-hot keen pressed
down each day deeper deeper into ones
scorching flesh

  outside interest revived a little as the
trial approached when it was definitely
scheduled on the calendar when the day
and hour was set jury impaneled forces all
lined up on either side to damn or save him
then did the reporters begin to write again on
rickety pale-inked newspaper typewriters
and head-lines to blossom out once more
the public mouth always gaping began to
water for the tidbits of a blackmail case

  the case came to trial before judge mc-
cafferty who though weak on law was
strong on feudal allegiance to the powers
that had made him dill was among those
powers mccafferty had helped him kill a
bit of employers liability legislation so now
he sat upon the bench this fact though
known in newspaper row somehow or other
never yet had got itself into print nor did
it now but columns pages were filled with
the testimony of the two policemen the lieu-
tenant the elevator-man the messenger-boy
and dill himself grahams testimony too
was given but it was very brief there was
no other witness for the defense

  barnanj was beaten from the start he
could tell by the look of the jury as sitting
beside the wan and haggard graham he
conferred with the no-longer hopeful martin
stone in the- packed court-room just how
the steeled conscience



little chance there was for a man in grahams
position

  the character of the complainant was
brought out powerfully by the district attor-
ney in his opening all the witnesses for the
state told strong connected stories barnard
understood how carefully they had been
coached his heart sank and graham turned
a shade whiter than even before as they
heaped ossa on pelion dills own story
concise circumstantial positive delivered as
though totally without personal animus but
rather withreluctance capped the climax

  mr foreman asked the clerk when
the jury returned in an even time-worn
voice more toneless than a phonographs-
mr foreman have you arrived at a ver-
dict

  we have

  what say you mr foreman

  the jury finds the prisoner guilty as
charged in the indictment

   this bein the only case ready for dis-
posal this afternoon said mccaffertv anx-
ious to get out to the south end grounds
before the end of the game  court is ad-
journed until to-morrow

  he rose fatly gathered up some memo-
randa and retired into his little dressing-
room the jury in charge of an officer
prepared to go back to the hotel the public
jostled out reporters surrounded dill
everything was confusion

  come said a sheriff touching graham
on the shoulder

  the young man started looked around
him as though startled from a dream and
got up slowly from his chair he looked
a full decade older than on the night of his
arrest his face was- thin and deep-lined
his hand shook his shoulders seemed bent
as by a great weight stunned he waited
the sheriff had to take him by the arm and
lead him away

  barnard was only mute he only pressed
his hand to his eyes a minute shook his head
and swore a frightful oath under his breath
but stone with a ghastly mockery of a smile
exclaimed

   buck up old man well file a motion
for a new trial right away youre a long
way yet from being sentenced never say
die

  graham turned on him a lack-luster gaze
shook his head and made no answer the
officer urged him along separated him from
his friends

    see you at charles street just as soon-

to be

    	rr

as possible gulped stone he sat down
heavily and hid his face in his hands

  so this is-justice he exclaimed

  the motion for the new trial was promptly
overruled and on the last friday of the
month graham was brought up to the court-
house again with a miscellaneous lot of
offenders to be sentenced that was a job
mccafferty enjoyed-dealing out penalties
one after another like a country school-
master using the birch puffed with a sense
of power he sat there surveying the wretches
huddled before him in various stages of
poverty misery and distress and served the
masters who had put him where he was

  one by one the victims stood up as the
clerk called their names and listened to the
few brief words that sealed and bound
the knots of fate words impersonally spoken
by the clerk who served as proxy for the
court rare sport indeed mccafferty en-
joyed nothing better save perhaps a quiet
game of faro-bank in bosworth place or a
fast go at the grapevine a c rather a
sporting luminary he

   john graham 

  john stood up and faced the court he
looked far cooler and more bllected than at
the time of the trial a new expression had
come into his face-a quiet even gaze rather
hard but confident he waited self-pos-
sessed

  through his mind was running the phrase-
ology of the statute learned long ago by
heart his constant comrade by day by night
for weeks and weeks that seemed to stretch
back into eternity whoever being armed
with a dangerous weapon assaults another
with intent to rob or murder shall be pun-
ished by imprisonment in the state prison
not exceeding twenty years

  john graham said the clerk again
squinting near-sightedly

    yes sir

  because of mitigating circumstances and
the purely circumstantial character of the evi-
dence the court is inclined to leniency it
is the sentence of the court that you serve an
indeterminate term not to exceed five years

  thank you said graham unmoved

   that afternoon he was taken in the prison-
van to charlestown booked shaved bathed
given a  close hair-cut dressed in the coarse
gray woolen suit of the massachusetts con-
vict and under the number of  was
assigned to a cell on the third floor of the
western gallery
the fine art of running
a freight

 

b y charles frederick carter

judging by the fuss that is made over them it might be inferred that if one
of those sumptuous through passenger-trains were to skip a trip this old
earth would stop turning over and we would all go straight to the demni-
tion bow-wows on the contrary it is much more likely that if all the passen-
ger-trains  earth were suddenly deprived of existence all the railroads would
continue paying dividends for it is not the much-advertised passenger-train
that earns the money but the lowly freight which sneaks out into the darkness
after the pullman passengers are asleep and rounds up the revenues in its modest
way never letting anybody but the auditor and the treasurer know what it is
doing it is the working-bee in the busy bond-making railroad world

in handlingthe freight traffic of this country the railroads have one of
their greatest problems -how time is made the biggest
trains and the red ball specials

ccording to reports made
to the interstate commerce
commission for the year
ending june   the
passenger earnings of the
railroads of the united states
aggregated  while the freight
earnings footed up the grand total of -
 that is the freight depart-
ment earned three dollars for every dollar
earned by the passenger department or to
put it more precisely the freight earnings
constituted  per cent of the operating
revenues while the passenger earnings were
only  per cent the remaining  per
cent being earned by carrying mail ex-
press etc

  going back to the year  for which
more detailed information is available it is
found that the miles run by freight-trains
aggregated  and the miles run
by passenger-trains 

  while the mileage of the passenger-trains
was nearly as great as that of freight-trains
the difference in earnings per mile run by

the two classes of trains is startling for the
freight-trains earned  per train mile
while passenger-trains earned 

  yet the petted and pampered passenger-
train had such tremendous advantages that
the freight would have been warranted in re-
fusing to enter such a one-sided competition

  the average pay for hauling one ton of
freight one mile was seven and sixty-five
hundredth mills now the average passen-
ger paid just under two cents per mil in
 and as average passengers will run
about fourteen to the ton the rate amounted
to twentyeight cents per ton per mile rough-
ly speaking

  the average haul for each ton of freight
was  miles and the average receipts
per ton were only  if freight could
only be hauled at passenger rates receipts
for the average haul would have been -
 if you will just bear in mind that while
laboring under odds of  to  the freight-
train is earning three dollars to the passen-
ger-train s one dollar perhaps you may take
off your hat to the next box car you see
the fine art of running a freight



  possibly this method of arriving at the
relative merits of the achievements of the
freight and the passenger-train may not be
scientific enough to be passed by a certified
accountant but it will serve as a means of
making clear an important truth and as
such it will be indorsed enthusiastically by
any operating officer

  when the limited is due the freight-train
has to get off the earth the through freight
has to take the passing track even for a
dinky local passenger hauled by a fussy
antique old enough to be the grandmother of
the magnificent modern consolidation engine
on the freight and passenger-trains are be-
coming so numerous that to move freight at
all is something of a fine art

letting twenty-five trains pass

  on the double-track hudson river divi-
sion of the new york central it has hap-
pened that freight-trains have had to lie at
anchor on some sequestered siding far from
home and supper for five hours at a stretch

  on this division there are  scheduled
passenger-trains and express and milk-trains
having passenger-train rights between cro-
ton and albany new york

  imagine a hard-working well-meaning
freight conductor trying to dodge his way
through such a maze picture if you can
his heartrending appeals to the despatcher
for  help  against some of the numerous
limiteds and near-limiteds

  to be sure there are no meeting-points on
a double-track road but there are pass-
ing-points enough to satisfy any craving
through freights have been passed on the
hudson division by as many as twenty-five
trains

  yet the new york central in 
earned only  from passenger
traffic while the freight earnings footed up
 even this was a pretty high
proportion for the passenger earnings when
compared with other roads

chopping up the freights

  the new york new haven and hartford
is the only road in the country on which the
receipts from passenger traffic exceed the
freight earnings on other roads passenger
earnings make up but a small part of the
total revenues-in some cases  per cent
and even less

  the passenger earnings of the lacka-
wanna a high-class road running through a

thickly settled country in  were -
 as compared with freight earnings
of 

  but to return to the hudson river divi-
sion under the condition outlined in the
foregoing the division has to handle an aver-
age of  cars a day while the number
not infrequently runs as high as 

  to handle traffic at all it is necessary to
chop the freight-trains into small bites an
average west-bound train consisting of 
cars and the east-bound  cars on die
mohawk division the same class of engine
that hauls  cars on the hudson division
would haul  cars because the mohawk
division is four-tracked and thus there is
room for a locomotive to swing itself

  fortunately the passenger traffic on die
hudson river division is bunched in day-
light hours thus making it possible for the
freight-trains to slip out under cover of
darkness between  and  pm no
freight-trains leave the terminals the whole
road being surrendered to passenger traffic
only the luckless way-freights are out and
they have to do the best they can

the men at headquarters

  railroading is a science in which many
are called but few are chosen for the big
jobs at headquarters it is enough to make
an old-timer brought up on a single-track
road way out west gasp to learn how the
work of handling a busy division on an
eastern road is divided and subdivided and
then cut up and to see the swift gait at
which everybody and everything travels

  the division superintendent alone has a
staff big enough to have run the whole road
in the good old days there is a chief
clerk and half a dozen other clerks an
assistant superintendent with more clerks a
passenger trainmaster with a chief clerk and
more clerks and a freight trainmaster with
a chief clerk and more clerks

  of course there is a chief despatcher and
three trick despatchers there might be
more if anybody could invent a way to em-
ploy more than one man to handle the trains
on one division at one time

  finally there is that humble but highly
important functionary the car-service derk
who distributes empties over the division
for loading in such a way as to keep the
kicks from shippers down to a minimum-
if he can no railroad ever furnished cars
to suit all its patrons and no railroad ever
will


the railroad mans magazine

   in the evolution of the railroad the train-
order has been pretty nearly lost in the
shuffle few train-orders are issued on a
big double-track line now for the block sig-
nal answers the purpose much better

side-stepping passenger-trains

  when an inferior train should take a mid-
dle track or siding for a superior train the
engineer blows four blasts on the whistle
while passing the block-station preceding the
one at which switches are located if given
the clear main-track signal at such a block-
station the train may proceed the engineer
calling for switches at each successive block-
station preceding the one where the siding or
middle track is located until given switches
and signals to turn out

  the proper clear signal given to a train
at a block-station is all the authority needed
to proceed on a main track ahead of trains
about due or overdue for it is given by and
with the advice and consent of the des-
patches based on reports from the tower-
men this relieves the conductor of the
necessity of spending half his time in sta-
tions importuning the despatcher for help
agin thirty-seven

  freight-trains are classified into way-
freight pick-up-and-drop slow through and
fast through freights at least the officers
and the more dignified clerks so designate
them in general terms mentioning the train
numbers when they want to be specific but
among the trainmen and in the yards they
are known as  the lemon  the raw-
hide the yellow dog holy ghost
and similar endearing terms

a regulation slow freight

  by way of illustrating the journey of a
way-freight which serves the people who
have to ship in less than car-load lots the
new york central send one out from the
seventy-second street yards new york city
at six oclock in the morning and it puts in
the rest of the day getting to croton thirty-
four miles away the train - crew consists
of  conductor and four trainmen-they
ceased to be brakemen long ago they never
touch a -brake and have only a nebulous
idea of what a hand-brake is very few
trainmen even carry a switch-key tower-
men or switch-tender throw the switches
while the pick-up-and-drop trains set out
and spot the empties and pick up the load

the pick-up-and-drop trains do all the

switching at the smaller stations the more
important stations having from one to four
switch engines assigned to them these
trains run through between new york and
poughkeepsie  miles in  hours if they
have good luck they are obliged to do
their work at night to keep out of the
way of the passenger-trains another run
for this class of train is between poughkeep-
sie and albany

   through freight-trains run the length of
the divisipn between new york and albany
the slow trains hauling ore coal grain and
similar commodities and making the run of
 miles in about twelve hours the fast
trains covering the distance in seven or eight
 hours

   some solid trains of high - class freight

o	o 

such as dressed beef make the run in five
hours sometimes a fast train gets over the
division without a stop taking water from
the track-pans

strenuous work for  rainmen

   it is difficult for an outsider to realize the
hardships of the trainmen on a fast through
freight there are only two of them to do
all the work the head man has to sit on
the firemans seat-box the entire distance
watching the firemans desperate struggles to
keep her hot until he is fatigued and bored
beyond expression

   on all eastern roads where interruptions
by passenger traffic are most serious freight
traffic is very heavy averaging  tons
a year for every mile of track in new york
new jersey pennsylvania delaware and
maryland as compared with  tons per
mile per year in the southwestern states

   still high-class freight isjiustled through
pretty lively to cite some examples of reg-
ularly scheduled fast freight-trains no
mc  makes the run of  miles from new
york to chicago via the new york central
and michigan central in  hours an
average speed of  miles an hour for the
entire distance including all stops an aver-
age train consists of  cars

  the baltimore and ohios fast freight
covers the longer route  miles between
the same points in  hours an average speed
of  miles per hour including all stops with
an average train of  cars

some fast freight runs

a regular fast freight from boston via
the boston and albany new york central
the fine art of running a freight



and lake shore makes the run of 
miles in  hours

  the illinois central runs a fruit-train
averaging  cars from new orleans to
chicago  miles in  hours including
all stops

  the katy runs a daily through freight
from st louis to galveston  miles in
 hours an average speed of  miles per
hour for the entire distance including stops

  the southern pacific has a scheduled
through freight running from galveston to
san francisco  miles in  hours
an average speed of  miles per hour in-
cluding stops for this long distance

  the wabashs no  a through freight
runs from buffalo to omaha  miles
in  hours an average speed of  miles
per hour

  the northern pacific nearly equals this
gait in the run of  miles between min-
neapolis and seattle making it in  hours

  the chicago burlington and quincy has
a regular freight-train running through from
st louis to billings montana  miles
in  hours an average speed of  miles
per hour

  the friscos banner train no  de-
livers freight from kansas city in birming-
ham alabama  miles away in y
hours making an average speed of 
miles an hour including stops

striving for records

   all this is mere daily routine which by no
means measures the possibilities of handling
freight expeditiously for instance the erie
in july  believing the time for mer-
chandise between new york and buffalo
was too slow proceeded to shorten it
thereupon the lehigh valley and new york
central took a hand in the time-reducing
game by cutting the figure to  hours

  when the other roads had shown their
cards the lackawanna which has the short-
est route pressed express-cars into service in
which freight was received at the new york
piers up to  pm these cars were then
whisked through to buffalo in  hours
reaching the lake city before the teamsters
had breakfast

  dry-goods shipped from new york the
preceding afternoon were put on the counters
of department-stores in time for enterprising
shoppers to get the benefit of early purchases
about this time somebody happened to re-
member that the money wasted on this fool-
ishness could be applied to the payment of

dividends so they shook hands all around
and agreed to forgive and forget the dry-
goods limited

  after all when it comes to real long-dis-
tance shipments in fast time the canadian
pacific took the bun some time ago on de-
cember   a consignment was shipped
from yokohama on a canadian pacific
steamer it was transferred to canadian
pacific box cars at vancouver january 
 and was reshipped on a canadian pa-
cific steamer at west st john january 
arriving in liverpool january  covering
the total distance of  miles in  days
at an average speed of  miles an hour
including all stops and two transshipments

sme serious freight blockades

  as for volume of traffic the pittsburgh
and lake erie in april  moved 
cars north in  hours in  trains which
was an average of a train every nineteen
minutes in november of the same year
the pennsylvania goaded thereto by a block-
ade for the first time in the history of the
railroad issued an order to the effect that
until further notice passenger-trains were to
have no rights over freight-trains but were
to make their schedules as best they could

  under this rule  cars were rushed
out of pittsburgh in two days on novem-
ber   trains aggregating  cars
were moved over the pittsburgh division of
the panhandle when all this had been
done  miles of freight-trains were wait-
ing to get into pittsburgh yards

  during a still worse blockade in 
the pennsylvania established the worlds
record for handling freight in the week
ending at midnight september  
cars passed lewiston junction an average
of  cars a day for the week the fol-
lowing day september   freight-cars
passed lewiston junction

  on june   on the pennsylvania
engine no  hauled  steel cars con-
taining  tons of coal-gross weight of
the train behind the engine  tons-
from altoona to harrisburg  miles in

way one of the three roads in the united
states having the heaviest traffic per mile of

one engine hauled a train of  steel cars
containing  tons of coal - the gross
weight behind the engine being  tons-
 miles from victoria to sewalls point


the railroad mans magazine

in s hours  minutes an average speed of
 miles per hour including three stops

minimizing red tape

  to handle the enormous freight traffic of
a great railway system hindered by the exac-
tions of the passenger traffic calls not only
for clever executive work but the coopera-
tion of an alert and willing operating force

  the army of freight-handlers must finish
their tasks on time the agents staff must be
ready with seals and way-bills and the yard-
crews must get cars out of the way and make
up trains the moment they are ready the
roundhouse force must have the power ready
and the train-crews must turn out promptly
when called and devote their particular at-
tention to getting over the road

  much depends upon the yardmaster al-
though no one but the superintendent and
the paymaster are aware of his existence the
yardmaster works the miracles that save
hopeless situations

  various schemes have been evolved to sim-
plify the task of moving high-class freight
one of these is the  red ball  system which
has been adopted by a number of the big
roads the object of the  red ball  system
is to run all-important freight through with
a minimum amount of red tape

  the most conspicuous of the outward and 
visible signs of the  red ball  system is a
destination-card about x inches tacked on
both sides of the car on this card a ball
six inches in diameter is printed in bright
red lettered in white upon itare the name
of the station where loaded wre date the
number of the train in which it is to travel
and its destination

keeping the  red ball  moving

  red is the universal sign of danger on the
railroad in this case the  red ball  is a
sure sign that any conductor who delays the
car bearing it for any cause less than the
loss of a pair of trucks is in danger of hear-
ing something mighty unpleasant from the
superintendent

  other virtues of the red ball are that
it facilitates the tracing of freight as well
as its movement and it relieves the auditors
office of a large amount of correspondence
relating to movements and delays the  red
ball  is tacked only on cars containing per-
ishable and other valuable freight no
dead freight such as grain cotton coal

or lumber is -allowed to travel in a  red
ball  train except when taken to fill out
the tonnage the  red ball  cars take
precedence over all classes of freight except
live-stock and in any case must be kept
rolling right along to their destination

  each of the more important stations is
designated by a letter or letters and each has
a series of numbers beginning at    and
running up to a certain figure these let-
ters and numbers are used in numbering the
cards and way-bills some roads use a  red
ball  envelope to contain way-bills for  red
ball cars others merely use a red way-
bill there are blanks on the back of the
way-bill for recording the cars movement
each conductor when the car is turned over
to him at the forwarding or division-point
must enter in the space provided the number
of the train and train symbol station taken
from and left at date and signature

records and reports

  the agent at the forwarding-point reports
by wire to the superintendent of transporta-
tion all cars forwarded in  red ball  trains
immediately after the train leaves giving all
symbol letters and numbers

  this is known as a consist report if
a car has to be set out for repairs a report
explaining the cause is made out on a slip
of a certain color and pasted on the  red
ball envelope or way-bill

  the report is wired to the superintendent
of transportation as the train proceeds it
is reported by wire from certain stations on
a  passing report which gives all the sym-
bols for each car in the train arrival at
destination is similarly reported the car-
service agent of the chicago and north-
western has a huge chart on the walls of his
office on which a graphic record of the move-
ment of  red ball  freight is displayed

  running horizontally the length of the
chart is a list of stations above and below
are three rows of hooks on which boards
seven inches square may be hung these
boards are full of holes in which pegs are
placed labeled with the code letters and the
numbers assigned to the stations at which
the cars in a train originated each board
represents a train and each peg a car

  as the train proceeds and is reported the
board is moved along the chart until its des-
tination is reached thus the car - service
agent can see at one comprehensive glance
the position of all the red ball freight in
transit on his road

                     art is long and time is fleet-
         n	ing and the jail is not our goal

imited was at a standstill

  were waiting for the
cker to clear away the re-
ns of a freight piled along
track somewhere up the line

           that is how we happened to
meet skip simpson

  it seems he had been roosting underneath
the freight the accident had knocked him
from his perch and providence had sent him
down the track to us uninjured

  we needed skip simpson inflammatory
peevishness was setting in when he arrived
it disappeared as soon as he began to talk
a man of benign appearance named stilwell
invited him into the smoker and handed him
a cigar

  unfold to us said stilwell the story
of your life let us glean the knowledge you
have reaped tell us what you held and
what was in the draw

  sure said the fast - reviving derelict
sure i will life strikes me as a funny
proposition it is sad in spots but i cant

say this is one of them sometimes the cards
go bad and then again you fill here i am
jolted off a brake-beam expectin to wake up
where a g od story dont get you anything-
but-here  am shook loose from a dusty
night freight-and-travel wherein the luxuries
of life are not what you would call numer-
ous and im set down soft and easy in the
midst of peace and plenty

   you may have noticed that when i
stepped in here i reached into my pocket and
made a motion toward that button in the
wall that wasnt any bluff it was force of
habit i used to travel this way friends

   i might as well acknowledge at the out-
set that i was born with brains early in
the game i grabbed my wad out of the gen-
eral fund for frisky thinkers i took to see-
ing north america and principal way-sta-
tions

  life was a movin panorama with skip
simpson directin whither it should move
how fast and whence i was the boss intel-
ligent observer vhen things didnt look
	the railroad mans magazine

george washington or an indian squaw
they put em on the map and later the tracks
went in that direction from the way folks
rubbered at those freak effects in nature i
figured that scenery of that sort must get
travel for a road it made me think

    whats the matter i says to myself
 with a wise man like yourself manufacturin
similar attractive sights along some railroad
line why cant skip simpson get next to
some passenger-traffic manager and spring a
proposition to create along the way of travel
attractive geological formations that will look
like anything from the venus de milo to the
sphinx of egypt at say five thousand dol-
lars per  i knew those things were classic
and would take they would make money
for a road

  when i got that idea i near fell off the
freight that i was dingin to but i managed
to hang on till i got to where the big talk
could be made

  when you wear acelluloid collar that
has never seen a sponge and a fried-egg hat
and a suit of clothes thats faded green that
is the time when gettin next to the influential
party that you wish to hypnotize makes
breakin into a bank vault at high noon on
a busy day seem like an easy and a pleasant
pastime

   that passenger-traffic manager i was
after inhabitated the fifth floor which was
also infested by the president and all the

good to me i just closed my eyes and let em
glide on by but it seems i had a round-
trip ticket on the route that i had taken
it wasnt long before i was back where i had
started from-dead broke

  while there wasnt any coin in my pock-
ets in my educated ears there was the sound
of it mixed with the jolt of trains and the
rumble of the rails i took to ridin freights
where the jolt and rumble part was real
enough but the coin was imaginary

  ridin freights gets on your nerves in
time one day i was hangin to the bottom
of a stray from some place where they build
em low and my horizon line was limited
 this is no way for me to tour the continent
i says  theres nothin to it but a backache
and cinders in your eye

   i began to think of all those trips that i
had taken on the velvet i remembered how
i used to pay three dollars for a meal and
how i used to lean back and knock the ashes
off a fat cigar with the tip of my little finger
i recalled the scenery too

   i recollected that the sights along the
way were featured by one road in particular
it hired a loud-voiced party in a uniform
to point out things to you strange things
they were-rocks that looked like indians
or animals or buildings it was natural
scenery that diidnt look that way when the
roads surveyors ran across a rock or cliff
that looked like chief rain-in-the-face or

you dont look like a mich aelangelo to me
simpsons scenic enterprise



other big ones there were guardians at
every door that led in toward the main works
each time they put me out i took another
look up at the fifth floor and walked around
the block and came back for another try
but it wasnt any use i guess it was the
green clothes and the celluloid

    i began to know that it was up to me to
take a chance my eye kept travelin up the
fire - escape toward a piece of plate - glass
where i saw  passenger traffic manager 
printed large and plain i had gambled
some before in my time but this way of
gettin next was a game id never tried

    i couldnt notice anything to stop me so
i started up that was one time in my life
when i was lucky the window wasnt fast-
ened and the manager was out but on his
desk there was a half-smoked smolderin
cigar knowing hed come back soon i
stepped out into the waiting-room

    i want to tell you friends that when
i heard him coinin up the hall
my old desire to travel got me
strong after climbin a five-
story fire-escape and enterin a
private office by the window route
a man has got to think some fast
to make good

    by the time he had showed 
up i had changed my plans three
times the third change bein
naturally the quickest i had to
hurry some in puttin back the
feather-duster i had grabbed to
impersonate the janitor

    honesty i says  is rare
enough to go once in a while lets see how
shell work this time

    when he arrived he sized me up cellu-
loid and all

     how did you get in   says he

   i told him how i had got tired of bein
kicked down-stairs all day and how i had
broke in with a ripe idea worth big money
to his road and ready to be picked

     i know what i ought to do says he
 but ill wait a minute what is your prop-
osition it must be a wonder youre ta-
king big chances burglary will be the
charge unless you come through with the
o k stuff talk fast

  the way i spread out that scenic
scheme of mine for him was pleasing to the
eye it made him behold grand bits of mag-
nificent manufactured natural scenery that
looked like statuary and similar art relics
 eroded by the simple and continuous action
of the elements as the guide - books say

friends there was class to what i said to
him i surprised myself

    you dont look like a michelangelo to
me he says

    i will look like a near relative of his
as soon as i get busy i replies  the
venus i went on  would come a little
higher than the others i might have to
study up her curves some and maybe it
would take a little extra practise to carve her
out to suit your boston travel

    but the sphinx now-say just the bust

red hacked away a

famous profile of
george washington

and head-she would be dead easy shes
naturally an outdoor proposition kind of
rough-featured and rocky-looking which is
what youre after

    what do you say to five thousand dol-
lars for an imitation of the sphinx gazin
about nine thousand miles into space like
she has forgotten faro and the rest of the old
card-sharps five thousand dollars with an
option of six months at six per cent youll
know by that time how she hits the public
if a photograph of her fails to liven up your
scenic catalogues and increase your first-class
travel i dont want a cent are you on 

   after studyin a while he says  that
sounds fair i dont see how the company
can lose go ahead get up your scenic
sphinx well see how she takes

   let me tell you that was a large order to
come by the way of a five-storv fire-escape
and to a man who knew about as much about
sculpture as a coyote knows about music


the railroad mans magazine

i walked the streets a week wonderin what
the answer was finally it came to me and
its name was reddy foster red was a tomb-
stone cutter i had met once i located red
and told him what i wanted i promised
him one thousand dollars for the job he
was taken with the idea he said he was
tired of working for dead ones

     the proposition looks alive to me says
he  its high art thats what it is high
art pro bono publico me for it he says

  red came through with coin enough to
land us on the ground which was as wild a
country as a buzzard ever sailed across
everywhere you looked there were gorges
chasms ravines mountain peaks waterfalls
cliffs and rocks that stuck up all around like
crumbled pyramids

  we picked a clear half-mile stretch
along the road from which you could get a
good view of a big rock away to the west
against the sky

   thats pretty close i says youll
have to do a nifty piece of work at that
range those tourists carry glasses but you
know your business better than i do re-
member theres a cold thousand in it for
you-fifty big gold pieces-if you carve a
sphinx that will look as if nature was on the
job about ten thousand years ago thats the
sort of scenic wonder that i want--some-
thing old you understand and classy

     fifty twenties  murmurs red  why
i would be carvin snow-white doves and
rest - in - peace designs and angels for six
months before i ever would see that much
fifty yellow boys let me at this piece of
ancient art before you change your mind i
can ahnost see it loomin up there now it
wont take me long-about two days by
to-morrow morning youll owe metwenty-five
of those yellow pieces

   red seemed to have the money - fever
strong  forget the coin i says  and go in
for high art pro bono publico or whatever
you said it was

     all art says red  has its incentive
your real artist has to have an inspiration
dont worry ive got mine this little job
is going to please the public its not for
dead ones i am doing this

     thats the way to talk i says  you
get the right idea the old sphinx loomin
large against the sky among those natural
obelisks and time-worn pyramids ought to
please the tourist eye even if the rest of the
landscape aint exactly on the straight egyp-
tian level you can begin to hack the old
girl out any time the fancy strikes you now

  while red was chiselin out that bit of
natural oriental scenery i kept camp he
worked till dark he said it was a tougher
job than he had figured on

    itll take a week he says  swingin
in the air carvin a fifteen-foot profile onto
that granite range is different from sittin
on a soap-box chippin off the marble from
around a dove of peace

   it was a tough job all right enough i
felt sorry for red but along about the fifth
day i could see that he was getting things in
shape our provisions were running low
there was only just about enough grub left
to last red till he got through so that night
i told him to go ahead and finish up the old
girl and to meet me later in civilization at the
foot of the grade i caught a freight and
landed in the little burg below and began to
kill time waitin for red to show up with his
finished art report it was a lonesome spot
where that railroad hit the slope

   one evening i was sittin on a baggage
truck when a train from up the grade blew
in red crawled out from underneath

    shes done says he  and a finer piece
of natural scenery dont exist nowhere
just then from the open window of a
private car i heard a voice i seemed to
know sure enough it belongs to my old
friend mr passenger traffic manager

   listen red i says  thats the
same identical party weve been workin for
but from the sound of him pay-day is a
long way up the line for us

  i dont just recollect the exact words that
came floatin out of that car-window but i
got the sentiment which they expressed all
right it seems our scenic wonder had got
in bad she was not winning any prizes in
the natural beauty contest so that you could
notice it it turns out that in the making of
her red has hacked away and destroyed a
famous rock profile of george washington
the one choicest wonder of the scenic -way

   we also gathered from the language
which kept coinin from that window that
there wasnt any limit to the punishment for
such a  criminal act of vandalism -thats
the name he gave it-as we had  wantonly
committed -thats the way he put it

    simp says red in a husky whisper
 let him talk his head off i did a good job
all the same she just kind of grew out of
that rock for me i sure was inspired

    red i says  dont make me laugh
forget it art is long and time is fleeting
and the jail is not our goal but it will be if
we hang around this place much longer
simpsons scenic enterprise



    how true that is says red and the
last i saw of him he was divin for a good
hold on a fast freight going north

  friends that was the last time i was
ever close to money-if you could call that
close it may not seem a sad event to you
my failin to clean up four thousand dollars
clear on that scheme of mine but it depresses
me sometimes what do you know about
that anyway  

for popularity beats anything on record
that sphinx you tried to make is the finest
imitation of the classic profile of the lady on
a twenty - dollar gold - piece that ever hap-
pened it lures more travel than all our
other sights combined in our scenic circu-
lars we have a picture of her against the
golden disk of sunset-the illusion is a won-
der why folks have cut that picture out
and tried to buy things with it come with

  there was a painfulsilence in the smo-
ker it was broken by one stilwell the be-
nign-appearing gentleman

  i know said he that ive been on
your trail for the last five years-ever since
you did that little job you mention i usually
come in on the finish of a story like yours
most of the men i go after give themselves
away in the smoker where your sort get con-
fidential

   being a detective for the road whose
property you fooled with i have a little
duty to perform about a month after you
did that piece of work our road discovered
that from a certain half-mile stretch there
was visible a scenic wonder the like of which

me and gather that five thousand dollars
with accumulated interest also an annual
pass you are it with this road

  skip simpson scratched his head but not
because it itched he was meditating

  wouldnt that get you friends he said
why for five long hungry years ive been
wanderin up and down the ties nursin the
superstitious notion that carvin hereafter
mottoes onto tombstones had got red into a
kind of rut and queered that scheme of mine
but now that you remind me i do seem to
recall that the image on those fifty twenties
that i promised him did appear to be mighty
strong on reds mind when he chiseled out
that sphinx he said he was inspired

he said he was tired of

working for dead

fireman and brakeman and engineer
are valiant fellows and true

oh theyre always on tap when it comes to a scrap-
and so is th rest of the crew

but when there is trouble along the line

demanding quick action and brain

           you will usually find that the fellow behind
           is the boss of the wrecking-train

               oh the boss of the wrecking-train

    with tackle and block and crane

    when old troubles around hes the man on the ground

    a plugging with might and main

           he is always expecting disaster

           and hes ready to face it too

    be the trouble a switch or a train in the ditch

          he knows the exact thing to do

    no doubt hes some rough in his ways of speech

           and says what he thinks pretty plain

           but the calling he serves draws some hard on the nerves
           though hes seldom heard to complain

               oh the boss of the wrecking-crew

    hes trusty and tried and true

    with his derrick and crane his replacer and chain

                he shows us a trick or two

           his path of life is littered with wreckage

          his passport is  w-k

    his stock in trades nerve and good judgment

    much hustle big muscle clear brain-

           hes a stranger to fear and he keeps the track clear

how slow must a train run through an in-
corporated town

 how slow must a train be going when
passing a slow signal for a railroad crossing

  	if a mixed train approaches a railroad
crossing whistles to cross and at the same time
a passenger-train on the other line whistles to
cross which has the clear track

  	give a short history of the cairo and
poplar bluff branch-m e h dudley mis-
souri

  	it depends entirely on the speed restric-
tions of the town in question and of course on
the proportion of grade crossings to the distance
which must be traversed within the corporation
limits some towns are liberal to the railroads in
this regard allowing quite a respectable speed
provided that safety-gates etc have been installed
fifteen miles an hour is commonly regarded as
fair to both parties but it is nevertheless recalled
that many six-mile-an-hour crossings still remain
in the united states on the other hand should
the railroad be elevated through the town ex-
amples of which may be found on the pennsylvania
through newark new jersey chester pennsyl-
vania or wilmington delaware there is nothing
to prevent a train from proceeding at whatever
speed is desired

  	in reality there is no such thing as a
 slow  signal where two railroads cross and the
speed at which various crossings are to be nego-
tiated is usually covered in special instructions
which are to be found on one of the pages of the
employees time-table in many states there is an
imperative rule that all trains must come to a full
stop before crossing no matter what system of
signals may be employed or even if the way is
known to be clear to the engineer this is merely
in the interest of an additional precaution some


the railroad mans magazine

authorities considered it needless because the elab-
orate system of interlocking in vogue at practically
all crossings renders it impossible for the operator
to allow both trains to approach at the same time
the derail is open for the train on which the
signals are against

   	in the event of such a situation the superior
train is given preference should the latter be
due even within a reasonable time the operator
would likely hold the  mixed and clear its line

  	we believe that this road was commonly
called the  c a t branch of the st louis iron
mountain and southern but we are hazy even in
this assertion there was formerly a cairo ar-
kansas and texas and also a cairo and fulton
and the road which you mention may have been
either or both in order to get it straight and
in the quickest time we suggest that you corre-
spond direct with some official of the iron moun-

and for general information concerning them the

through the return of reports submitted at irregu-

to anticipate requests for information and they
may be obtained by addressing the secretary of

are worse arid speaking always from the stand-
point of an american engineer fireman or con-
ductor none of them offers any real appeal to a
man this does not mean that the roads thus
criticized are lacking in the essentials of good
railroading on the contrary they are everything
which might be desired in perfection of equipment
and thoroughness of administration but they dont

what size of stack should an engine have
with cylinders x inches and how
do you compute it

   	what is termed by the lap of a valve

  what is termed by the lead of a valve

   	how do you find the heating surface of a
flue

   	how do you find the- heating surface of a
set of grates

   	how do you find the area of a steam-port

   	how do you find the pressure on a safety-
valve

   	how do you find the area of an exhaust-
port

  	how do you find the pressure on a stay-

bolt

   	how do you find the pressure on a piston

  	which end of the piston has the most

pressure and why-w j waterloo iowa

   	for this size the stack should have about the
same inside diameter as the cylinders or possibly
an inch or two smaller there is no hard-and-fast
rule for determining the size of stacks notwith-
standing that the subject has been before the
mechanical world for many years theoretically
the exhaust nozzle if single is supposed to be one-
quarter of the cylinder diameter but unless un-
usually favorable conditions are present engines
will not steam satisfactorily following this rule
to illustrate this would mean a five-inch nozzle
for an engine with twenty-inch cylinders with
the rather indifferent coal in general use for loco-
motives the desired results would scarcely be at-
tained with a nozzle larger than four and a half
inches the relation of the stack in size to this
nozzle would be about four times the latters
diameter or eighteen inches it should also be
borne in mind that the diameter of any stack de-
signed for the best results is affected by the height
of the exhaust nozzle as the nozzle is raised the
diameter of the stack must be reduced and as the
nozzle is lowered the diameter of the stack must
be increased

  	the lap of a valve is that portion which
overlaps the steam-ports when it stands midway
over the valve face this is termed  outside lap
and ordinarily in speaking of the lap of a valve
it means outside lap inside lajk when present is
the amount which the valve overlaps the inside
edges of the steam-ports when the valve is in its
middle position

   	lead means the width of the opening of the
steam-port when the piston is at the beginning of
its stroke

  	multiply the outside diameter by 
and this result by the length of the flue in inches
and divide by  which will give total heating
surface in square feet for example in case of
two-inch flue twenty feet long

         xx
         --- sq ft

                 

  	in common practise about  to  square
feet of heating surface are given for each square
foot of grate there are however no reasons for
the proportions of either grate or heating surface
which are given excepting that it has been found
that they yield good results in ordinary working
the proportion of grate to heating surface is gov-
erned to a very large extent by the kind of fuel
used anthracite coal and the poorer qualities of
fuel require larger grates than good bituminous
coal or wood it is however quite certain that
the larger a boiler is and the greater its heating
surface in proportion to the steam it must generate
other things being equal the more economical will
it be in its consumption of fuel in other words
the more water it will evaporate per pound of coal

   and  as these ports are generally of
by the light of the lantern



rectangular shape simply multiply the length in
inches by the breadth in inches

  	the pressure is determined by multiplying
the area of the opening for the valve in square
inches by the greatest steam pressure in pounds
per square inch which the boiler is intended to
bear thus if the opening for a safety-valve is
three inches in diameter its area will be seven
square inches and therefore if the greatest steam
pressure which it is intended that the boiler shall
bear is  pounds per square inch the valve must
be pressed down with a pressure equivalent to
 x iso   pounds

   	multiply its diameter in inches by 
and this by its length in inches this result mul-
tiplied by the boiler pressure in pounds per square
inch will give the total pressure on the stay-bolt

  	it is generally assumed that the initial
steam pressure on the piston is  per cent of
boiler pressure consequently to obtain the total
pressure on the piston at the beginning of the stroke
multiply the diameter of the cylinder by itself and
the result by  this will give the area in
square inches and when multiplied in turn by 
per cent of boiler pressure in pounds gives the total
pressure

   	there is a slightly less total pressure on
the end of the piston to which the piston-rod is
attached as the diameter of the latter is an area
which must be reckoned with in a close calcula-
tion

on the baltimore and ohio railroad but the balti-

only lay claim to the first thought even the de-
velopment of the oil-burner is hard to follow but
it certainly lies between the southern pacific and
the atchison topeka and santa fe although
lacking in accurate statistical data at this writing
we are inclined to believe that the first-mentioned
road was the pioneer

class of engine for say between fifteen and twenty

   in regard to your questions  and  we have no

in the amount of traffic handled by the roads

a marine engineer is to enter as a cadet in the
merchant service or failing in this as an oiler
which always affords opportunity for advance-
ment in the consideration of this matter how-
ever it might be well to reflect that the carrying
trade of the world is practically under foreign flags
with the english predominating in the ratio of


the railroad mans magazine

about three to one this means that the wage
scale is much lower than under the american flag
and that the service is amply recruited by per-
sons of that nationality of course there are
many ships flying the american flag but they are
limited when compared with the others the pay
under the american scale is quite liberal-almost
twice that of the others full information concern-
ing pay can be secured by addressing the owners

tion

  	la junta and trinidad in colorado las
vegas albuquerque and gallup in new mexico
and winslow and seligman in arizona all of
the above of course are mentioned in connection
with the direct main line

  	in passenger service the prevailing type
has been the pacific -- and for freight the
decapod -- tandem compound locomotive
these latter engines have cylinders  inches and
x inchesworking steam pressure  pounds
per square inch and total weight  pounds
the santa fe also uses in that territory in freight
service the  ten-coupled and trailing truck
-- i total weight  pounds this class
was also on the tandem compound plan but we
understand many of them have been changed to
simple engines in addition to the above promi-
nent examples they have many engines of the con-
solidation -- type in service on the main as
well as the side linijs

   i it varies considerably between different sec-
tions of the country to such an extent in fact that
it would be difficult to quote a general average
this might approximate  in the east and 
or more in the west per hundred miles but it is
only an estimate and- is not intended to be as-
sertive

is also the headquarters of the central arizona
railway the elevation of the town is  feet
with the exception of small terminal facilities no
railroad-shops are located there on the santa
fe the engines run from winslow arizona to

california hence flagstaff is not a division point
the next large shop going east is at albuquerque

new mexico  miles and going west at

 miles west of flagstaff has very extensive
shops belonging to the santa fe the central
arizona railway has  locomotives and  freight-
cars operating on  miles of standard-gage road

  	the compensation for labor of all classes
is much higher in the far west than in the east
the writer recalls a rate of  cents per hour for
machinists and boilermakers in  on the santa
fe west of albuquerque and this has no doubt
since been increased at some points some so-
called handy men received as much as  cents
per hour and good helpers were equally well paid
you must understand however that the points
mentioned above with the exception of san ber-

by m n forney author of the  catechism of the

and a four or six-wheel swiveling rear truck but
no front truck a small water-tarik and coal-

ber of wheels composing the rear truck the

what is the relation of the curve of the track
to its length to state it clearly  in what
length are degrees of curve to be con-
tained i understood it to be contained in one
standard rail length  feet by this figure the
circle will be if it is a one-degree curve  times
 feet or  feet and if it is a two-degree
curve  feet its diameter by formula will
be  divided by  equals  and for
the other  divided by  equals 
these figures vary somewhat from your answer
to question in the july lantern regarding curves-
b m butte montana

  in our reply to h e in the july number
which you mention we were fully aware that the
answer about the curve was not absolutely correct
but we did not think that the gentleman referred
to wanted micrometer measurements of a railroad
curve in the united states it is customary to
express curvature in degrees noted by the deflec-
tion from the tangent measured at stations 
feet apart in other words the number of de-
grees of central angle subtended by a chord of
 feet represents the degree curve one de-
gree of curvature is equal to a radius of  feet
therefore the number of degrees divided into

	gives the radius in feet or per contra the
number of feet radius divided into  gives the
number of degrees this assumes that the 
feet are measured on the arc instead of the chord
but the error is so slight on curves commonly
used that it may be ignored for ordinary calcula-
tion we gave h e a one-degree curve as

	radius on a -foot chord and a two-
degree curve as  radius or one-half now a
one-degree curve being  radius a ten-degree
curve is  radius a twenty-degree curve is
 radius a forty-degree curve is  radius

   	rr

   in english practise it is common to define a curve
as so many chains  feet radius thus the
radius of a one-degree curved expressed in chains
would be  divided by  equals  there-
fore s divided by the degrees equals the radius
in chain or  divided by the radius in chains
equals the degrees

how much can a locomotive pull on a level
road and --------- per cent
grade this locomotive mentioned above
can pull a cars on a  grade the  cars weighing
 tons

  	how many empty cars can a locomotive pull
around a -degree curve on a level track without
pulling the middle cars off the track-r e ham-
ilton washington

  the editor is somewhat nonplused to grasp
what is meant by the  grade it is easy enough
to determine how much a certain engine with a
certain tractive power will pull on different grades
but before we can arrive at any conclusion it is
necessary to be supplied with additional elements
which are lacking in your query above quoted

  for example given a locomotive with a total
weight of  pounds with  pounds on
the driving-wheels-dfiving-wheels -inch diam-
eter cylinders  x  inches working steam
pressure  pounds tender  gallons ca-
pacity weight  pounds-derive the number
of tons hauled on a straight grade of one per cent
with - adhesion this question is now in
proper form for solution in the first place we
find that an  x -inch cylinder locomotive with
-inch driving-wheels will develop a tractive
power of  pounds now  pounds on
driving-wheels divided by - adhesions equals
 pounds and therefore this latter being
equal to the tractive power viz  pounds
the cylinders and weights are properly proportioned
having established these facts we find through
a somewhat elaborate calculation that with -
adhesion and  pounds resistance  tons will be
hauled for each  pounds on the driving-
wheels on a straight grade of one per cent there-
fore for  pounds weight a load of  x s tons
will be hauled which equals  tons from this
amount must be deducted the weight of the en-
gine and tender- pounds or  tons this
will leave - equal to  tons of cars and
lading which the engine will haul on the given
grade

  we are giving this illustrative case simply to
impress on many correspondents who neglect it

the necessity for furnishing complete data when
their problems are submitted it is impossible to
answer many questions arising from the incom-
plete form in which they reach us

   	a twenty-two-degree curve which is 
feet radius is very small but if the proper cars are
used it will not make any difference whether the
engine is on the end or- in the middle the num-
ber of the cars is of little importance provided
you do not attempt to pull them around too fast

is  feet from the point to where the gage-line is

   	the lead for each number of frog is dif-
ferent an easy rule to remember and one which
gives very close results is as follows multiply
twice gage  by number of frog and this

              honk and horace take a wild trip
              down the line with dauntless dick

hen honk and i built our
gyroscope-car to gyrate
around through the al-
leys of valhalla neither
he nor i nor any one
else thought much about
it the principle of the gyroscope is so
simple and well known that nearly every kid
in the country has one they can be bought
at any toy-store for two bits-so the appar-
ently wonderful stunts you can do with them
have ceased to astonish or perplex even the
rankest jasper in diis marvel-working age
of mechanical miracles

  this car of ours was constructed more for
the sake of economy and utility than to be a
thing of startling interest to the devotees of
rubberneck

  honk fig-
ured that a
monorail
wasnt nearly
so expensive
in its con-
struction and
maintenance
as a double-
railed track
and that the
car itself was
no more com-
plex than a

common motor-cycle in fact
a fifteen-year-old boy could
and did operate the fool tiling
after it was built it was used
for the purpose of delivering
parcels about town

  we had originally planned
a pneumatic tube system to
cover diat detail of the citys
needs but the t and p man-
agement got a bad attack of

chili con came in their pedal extremities when
honk submitted his estimates the pneu-
matic tube scheme was punctured before it
got out of the garage to use a mixed
metaphor

  we gathered up all the old scrap-iron
grain doors truss-rods and cog-wheels we
cloud find along the main line for three or
four divisions shipped it in to valhalla and
built the outfit ourselves evenings and holi-
days its motive power was electricity from
storage cells as simple as a dollar-and-ten-
cent door-bell

   steve jonagan at the hutton shops cast
the gyroscope itself for us it weighed a
ton and we fitted it on ball-bearings so fine
that once you got the thing to sizzing it would

   run for a solid
   week i do be-
   lieve

     the k i d
would leave it
standing all
night any-
where out in
the open un-
propped buz-
zing  away
and there it
would stand
as steady as a
furniture-car
you could no more push it
over than you could push
pikes peak

other making a complete

richard the lionheart wasn t a bit diffident

plete and impartial service the kid would
load up his parcels of groceries green staple
and fancy drv-goods hardware soda-water
jewelry shoes or laundry in station order-
rush orders first and use discretion with the
petulant patrons of course-and away hed
buzz making deliveries right and left leav-
ing in his wake a smiling host of pleased
housewives as the saying runs there was
nothing to it it was a cinch

  all this preliminary pow-wow being re-
moved from our chest we will now turn our
attention to the main show-actor of this play
who at this moment is due in on the red
motor-car from millardsville

  he brought his own announcement rich-
ard cceur de leo todd was the way hed
been tagged some twenty-six years ago he
said and he was either a big staller or a
reckless frivoler with long chances he had
his nerve with him in either case there could
be no doubt about that

  he had come out to valhalla on the advice
of a friend all the way from far-off chicago
-a breezy burg-to rest and recuperate and
catch a few million rainbow trout he had
a months vacation and he was going to do
it right that was evident

  richard the lionheart wasnt
a bit diffident-not any he was
calling the train-crew by their
first names when he alighted on
the station platform and his face
lit up when he saw me like i was
nothing more nor less than his
long-lost boyhood chum the
united states of america is an
airy country wind assails you
from all sides in zephyrs puffs
and gusts but dick was all to
the chinook

  he was of medium size big-
nosed wide-mouthed and full-
eared his hair and eyes were
of the van dyke shade of brown
and he sported a pince-nez he
wore a drooping cigarette pen-
dant from his lip ordinarily and
you never were in doubt as to
who was the hero of his stories-
that party was r c de l todd

  his life had been a twenty-
six-year long revel of adventure
witness

   atthe age of ten months while
ensconced in a large rocking-
chair in presumable safety he
had fallen chair and all out of
a second-story window into a
concrete areaway which was surrounded by a
spiked fence no damage resulted except to
the chair

  when a year and a half old he had strayed
away and been lost in a sewer two days alone
with the rats

  at three he had been tossed by an infuri-
ated bull-all bulls are infuriated only some
more so

  at four he was dragged by a street-car
and at five trampled beneath the hoofs of
runaway horses and stampeding elephants in
a circus parade

  he admitted that accidents happen in the
most conservative of families and that little
kids take chances because they dont know
any better but the proof of the intrepid soul
is the courting of danger when arrived at the
age of accountability

to defy death and devastation deliberate-
ly-theres euphony for you-to wade boldly
into any old kind of peril heedlessly with
sang-froid and ennui and sic semper raus mil
em and all that-thats where you shine out
as a hero he said like a comet with four
tails there was no mistaking the real
article then

  in substantiation thereof he said that
hero of the hairbreadth



long before he had begun to shave on the
sly with his pas razor and while he was
yet in knee-pants and plaited coats he was
a regular juggler with fate at the age of
twelve he said he swam two miles out to a
buoy in lake michigan and on the return
trip with a storm blowing off-shore he
battled fourteen long hours with wind and
wave before he crawled out on the sand

  he asked me if i didnt remember reading
about a boy hanging by his toes on a wager
from the roof-coping of the masonic temple
for twenty minutes i confessed that i
couldnt recall the hair-raising incident he
said that he was the boy

  in passing he mentioned a few little eccen-
tricities like going into a cage of tigers that
had just arrived from bengal of smoking a
cigar while buried to the chin in a barrel
of gunpowder of catching full-grown rattle-
snakes with his bare hands and of swinging
down from the fourth story of a burning
building on a live wire just before the walls
fell in

  since reaching his full maturity this
dauntless desperado had followed a line of
hazardous occupations to hear him tell it
that would queer his family as life-insurance
risks for the next two thousand years he
been steeple-jack lion-tamer fire-fighter
member of the life-saving corps on lake
michigan looper of the gap high-diver tra-
peze performer parachutist and night-
watchman in a powder-magazine

  at the present writing he said rather
shamefacedly that when at home he was
holding down the humdrum job of mixer in
a nitro-glycerin mill he exhibited stains
on his lingers which he said were caused by
acids ive seen the same kind from cig-
arettes

  honk took quite a shine to the young
man he struck honk as being most mild-
mannered and unobtrusive pretty soon you
could see the two of them bobbing around
together as thipk as cockroaches in a damp
basement honk said he was trying to keep
the boy from getting bored on account of ae
tiresome sameness of our dull little village

   that young daredevil he remarked to
me- that reckless young blade horace
simply snaps his fingers in the face of any
risk he tells me that the crowning ambition
of his life is to go over niagara falls in a
barrel or be lowered into the crater of vesu-
vius when its about to erupt

  ive known one or two of that kind i
observed without excitement  there used
to be a guy around arkansas city who was

eternally groaning and taking on about riding
bad broncs said the breed of real buckers
had become extinct nd quelling em was his
one grand passion

   one clay with my assistance mart
brady who helped around the station bor-
rowed a dray horse from old man potter
we put a few cockle-burrs under the saddle
and got this buster aboard after a lot of
palaver that old swayback plug laid back
its ears humped its spine and threw mr
rough rider into a pile of rock breaking his
leg in three places he couldnt ride a saw-
buck-that guy couldnt

  your real bona fide sure enough past-
master of anything i said  dont go around
yapping about his achievements through a
megaphone he perpetrates a few stunts and
lets the admiring populace have ocular proof
this is a great age for having things demon-
strated to you lfs missourians-

  yes i know what youre going to say
honk interrupted ive heard the whole
rigmarole including the ben franklin and
abe lincoln variations but our friend todd
is a very sincere and serious-minded young
fellow hes no empty-headed vapid brag-
gart you cant blame him if his life has
been full of thrills dont be the human
pickax horace 

  well go ahead and soak up his yarns
like a sponge that is what tickles him
a greedy listener is all he wants to make
him enjoy himself

   he was asking me about grizzlies yes-
terday honk said  he wants to get two
or three while lies here-

  alive i asked but of course he
catches them alive-

   i thought id take him out northwest
into the hills a ways honk continued
 there aint any grizzlies but we might
run across an old cinnamon which would be
better than none want to go along

   sure thing i said  i want to see
him perform dont i same as you

   eye borrowed a couple of wheels and
some rifles from gus up at the hardware
store well start about daylight we can
ride out that old indian trail until we get
into the breaks then go on afoot that will
be better than hoofing it all the way
anything is i agreed

  we called at the hotel for dick the fol-
lowing morning just as the sun was poking
his red poll over the eastern rim the
dauntless one had about finished breakfast
so he joined us without delay

   this morning reminds me of my boy-


the railroad mans magazine

hood days he chirped  i spent a year
with my uncle george up in the saskatch-
ewan country once and we used to get up
mornings like this and go after elk killed
em by the hundreds for their teeth an
elk tooth is the same as ready money among
the indians

    ever use a telescope sight   i asked

   very seldom he said  only on very
shy game like big horn and antelope id
rather pot a bear or a moose at close range
where you feel like if you dont stop him
youre a goner thats where the fun is-
for me worst fight i believe i ever had
was with a mountain lion- and so on ad
nauseam

  he claimed to be an absolute dead-shot up
to one thousand yards with a  and of
course laid it to the gun when he missed a
few sage-hens at a hundred yards and a chip-
munk i could have killed with a rock

  all you need to do is to go some four or
five miles into the mystic hills in a north-
westerly direction and the country is as
rough and wild-looking as anybody could
ask for but saving a few bobcats and
wolves there isnt much big game rambling
around

  the chances for running across that cin-
namon bear honk hoped for had about an
even break with flushing a spitting pugnas-
ticus or a wall-eyed wabbus i feared that
the worst encounter we would have would
be with a ferocious rabbit or a man-eating
woodchuck

  the three of us trundling our wheels up
the rocky trail with our rifles slung over
our backs like arabs or cossacks or who-
ever wears em that way began to labor at
the exhaust a trifle i was about to propose
a game of three best hands out of five to see
who went on after the game and who stayed
and herded the bicycles im no kind of a
hunter myself i never see the game until
its on its bounding way

  dick declared he saw another chipmunk
down alongside the hill a whopping
one he called it big as a dog and he
dropped hiswheel and clattered down the
steep slope through a growth of greasewood
and thorn-bushes to get a shot at it he
made enough racket to scare all the game out
of the county but i was indifferent about
that it wasnt my game

  a minute later we heard a shot and a
yowl and scratching and spitting honk
unlimbc-red his gun and loped down to in-
vestigate i moved on up a little farther to
where the trail curyed around a jutting rock

and where i thought i might be able to see
what was going on below without too much
physical exertion i trundled the wheel up
with me laid it down and assumed a re-
clining position myself then i peered over
the ledge

  a drama was being enacted some thirty
feet beneath me dicks chipmunk had
turned out to be a big rusty-looking bobcat
which hed shot through one ear and made
fighting mad he must have dropped his
gun down the canon after the shot for he
didnt have it honk was behind trvins to
get a bead on the cat but couldnt because
dick was exactly in the way

  his rustiness was just mad enough to at-
tack an army he was coming snarling
and spitting and that reckless galoot was
just standing there rubbering to see where
his gun had gone as unconcerned as if
kitty was coming to rub against his leg

  i was surprised it takes a good one to
stand still until a mad bobcat gets close
enough to rip the features off him i won-
dered if he was figuring on catching it alive
then i remembered once having seen a man
just after hed had a free-for-all argument
with a bobcat and as usual i butted in

  i knew i couldnt hit the varmint with a
gatling let alone one little measley bullet
out of a rifle so i reached around got the
bike and dropped it flat-ways right plump
on mr bobcat just as he squatted to leap
for richards throat

 whang yow ss-s-s-st down the
steep hillside went bicycle bobcat boulders
and bedlam

  hooray i yelled if hes shot be-
tween the eyes with a coaster - brake and
twice through the body with a spoke im
the hero that shot him 

   thats the system  shouted honk
you fixed him -

  all i saw was a two-hundred-yard streak
of rusty brown going up the ravine clothed
in expectoration i was too weak to stand
when they climbed back to where i was after
rescuing the lost gun and my bicycle dick
couldnt seem to grasp the humor of it ex-
actly he looked bewildered more than any-
thing else

  say i asked was you going to
take a chance at him slicing you or was
you too scared to run or what

  it was great honk mixed in before
richard the lionheart could reply  nerv-
iest thing i ever saw for downright cool-
ness that took the pastry

  what was the fuss all about anyway
hero of the hairbreadth	

asked the perplexed dick  howd you
happen to drop the wheel scared no
scared of a woodchuck why one time up
in the michigan woods-

  kiddo i said shake i know now
you wasnt scared

  they insisted on going ahead with their
hunt a while longer but i couldnt see much
to tramping on and on over those hills
every mile you walk away from home means
a mile and a half back so i started off
with my battered wheelwhich had ten spokes
broken a tire rent and the handle-bars twist-
ed i hit for the medicine house honk
bowled in later tired and hungry

   we never saw hide nor hair of a bear
he said  but dick killed an eagle and i

got two shots at a coyote he laughed about
that bobcat and making you believe he
thought it was a woodchuck he says hes
caught many a bobcat with his hands he
says theyre the easiest things to handle hes
ever tactyed

  dauntless dick got to coming down eve-
nings and sitting in a little friendly dime-
limit game with honk and me for pastime
during these sittings he related his marvel-

it dropped on mr
bobcat just as
he squatted
to leap for
richards
throat

ous adventures one
reminded of another

often we had to
yawn in his face be-
fore he would realize
when bedtime came
he took considerable
interest in honks
mechanical idiosyn-
crasies - the solar
motor the perpetual
motion the half-
dozen or so models
of flying - machines
and electrical hydraulic and aerodynamic
apparatus galore

 did i ever tell you bout my thrilling
experience in a submarine he asked one
night if lie had it wouldnt have mattered
for no doubt he could tell it different enough
the second time to make it unrecognizable

lets have it if it wont last longer than
ten i said looking at my watch

 it was when i was working for an elec-
trical company he said  one day they
had a hurry call to send a man right down
to the dock to do some inside wiring the
parties said it was a particular job so they
sent me to do it i took my kit and went
down

  a rowboat was waiting for me manned
by four sailors and a bosn i tumbled in
and was flicked across to where a short mast
of a thing stuck up above a speck of deck
fenced in with a low iron railing and lying
flat on the water i stepped out of the boat
onto the deck and the bosn led the way


the railroad mans magazine

down a stairway into the inside of the craft
it was as fine a boat as i ever saw

   the job didnt amount to anything
wiring for a set of fans some push-buttons
to call the help from one room to the other
and like o that it didnt take me half a

with the captain smoked his cigars and
swapped stories with him and such things

    he told me the boat was one of the gov-
ernment submarines shed come all the way
around through the erie canal and the great
lakes without an accident of any kind it
was a fine boat but ive forgotten the name
of it thought id never forget that boats
name but i have just before noon when
i got the work all completed the captain-
 howd they happen to be up in that neck
of the woods i asked i didnt know
they ever sent submarines around through the
rural districts-

  oh yes said dick airily they send
em all over this one was on a secret mis-
sion the captain told me he asked me if i
wouldnt like to take a dive to the bottom of
lake michigan would i well rather
all right sir he just called in a lieuten-
ant or mate or whatever they call em and
gave a few curt orders  seal the hatches
sink her twenty fathoms forward at half
speed like that aye aye sir the
mate said and in five minutes i was gazing
out a window watching the big fish go by

    you know a submarine attracts all kinds
of fish they follow along and gambol in
swarms and droves after a submarine its
wonderful to see them-wonderful some
are almost as big as the boat itself

     the captain said
they crowded around
the propeller very
often so thick that
every now and then
a big fellow would get
knocked in the head
t ie crowd would imme-
diately gobble him up
and race after the boat
to help eat the next one

    i was enjoying my-
self better than i ever
can remember when the
terrible accident hap-
pened the propeller got
tangled up in a school of
fish-clogged jammed
and snapped off close up
to the hull when the
resistance ceased of
course the engines raced
themselves to ruin be-
fore the engineer could
shut off the power

    they wrecked them-
selves in the fraction of
a minute having no
engines the pumps couldnt be worked the
water couldnt be pumped out of the ballast-
tanks and there we were twenty fathoms
down and likely to stay there

    i was the only cool head on board when
it came to the pinch the captain just sat
in a daze and the crew prayed and wrung
their hands i assumed entire command

     how long will our air supply last  i
asked the engineer

     two hours he said

    what pressure have we available for the
torpedo tubes   i asked next he found out
and i figured a minute we had enough to
shoot the seven men on board besides myself
to within twenty feet of the surface you
know at a hundred feet down the weights
and pressures are enormous

  yes said honk hurry up what
did you do then  

  do i clapped those fellows into the
tubes one by one and fired them up through
the water to life and air it took a full fif-
teen minutes apiece to load fire and set the
mechanism for another shot of course
with each man out the air supply in the

i leaped half out of the water i saw-
hero of the hairbreadth



boat became better but the unusual strain
told on me so that it took me nearly half an
hour to load and fire the last two men

  the oxygen was all but exhausted then
and it was-impossible for me to enter the tube
even if i had been able to manipulate the
firing apparatus panting and half fainting
i staggered to the companionway that led to
the upper deck then gathering my strength
in one supreme effort i filled my lungs with
that deadly gas burst the hatch open in a
frenzy and leaped upward into the water
that threatened to crush me like an egg-shell

   i shot toward the surface like an arrow
so great was the speed of my ascent that i
leaped half out of the water i saw-

   you saw baron marcus munchausen joe
mulhatton and opie dilldock i offered
 dancing a jig on the water

  honk gave me a pained look dick re-
sumed 

  no a large lake steamer lay hove to
her boats were picking up our men as they
came up every man was saved thanks to
my coolness and bravery congress voted
me a medal for it the submarine lies there
to-day at the bottom of the lake-

  i took a turn around in the open air for
a few minutes then that last one had aged
me i felt rheumatic i went over to the
power-house for a while and listened to
butch poteets artless prattle about ernes-
tine to get back to normal a couple of
hours later when i returned dick had faded
away and honk sat with the fixed gaze of one
stunned

  well i remarked whats new

   dick wants to run the gyroscope-car over
to millardsville some time honk said
 he thinks its a great invention

  dont let him i admonished hell
take it to europe and be doing the loop-the-
loop with it when you next hear of him

   i dunno we might let the kid take him
over it must be dull around here for him
say i said ive got a scheme you
know the canon southwest of town about
five hundred feet deep aint it in one place
run a rail out there and stretch a wire cable
across then let the kid take dick over for a
thriller

  the kid wouldnt do it itd scare him
to death

  ill risk a good nickel cigar liell do it
i said

   its a bully good scheme said honk
with enthusiasm well make it a feature
in our next folder advertising valhalla the
wonderful ride through the air 

  he was out at daylight the next morning
getting a force of men started on the happy
project

  i took buttsey blair otherwise the kid
with me and we walked down to view the
cable bridge across the chasm when it was
completed he looked it over with the air
of an expert

   would you be scared to run the car across
it i asked him

  ale naw ill run her across if mr
simpson guarantee its stout enough she
couldnt fall off you know

   buttsey i said confidentially  this
windy dick todd up at the hotel wants to
do something desperate and weve fixed this
up as a surprise for him if you can sort
of touch him up a litttle when you take him
across therell be a birthday present in it
for you but mums the word dont you
hint it to him about this canon before you
get him out on the cable

   all right mr horace said buttsey
 ive heard this mutt a braggin aready an
id just like to have some fun with him my-
self

  dick came down one evening after the
ten feet of concrete had set thoroughly
around the anchors of the cable and we were
ready to spring it on him he sat and gased
a while mentioning a few improvements that
would help the car he thought it ran too
slow for one thing and was as devoid of
thrill as a wheelbarrow

   well have the kid take you down to the
south end park some of these days said
honk carelessly  theres some awe-in-
spiring scenery down there

  dick said he would be tickled to see some-
thing of that character for a change

  the next day being favorable and butt-
sey getting his parcels delivered by ten
oclock we hunted up our victim and set out
with him

  when we reached the park honk and i
got out on a pretext of looking after some
imaginary improvement or other and told
the kid to take mr todd on out to the end
of the line and back he kept asking where
the much-lauded scenery was

   wipe off your specs and get ready said
buttsey well come to it just around this
curve and away they went honk and i
made a cross-cut through the weeds thinking
to arrive in time to see them on the return
trip  when we came out on the edge of the
cliff we saw the car stopped about midway
of the swaying cable and standing suspended
over the abyss
the railroad man s magazine

honk hooked on his little wagon
and went jiggling merrily

  of the lionheart we couldnt see even
a rumpled plume sticking up and the
diabolical buttsey seemed to be tinkering
at his motor

  he looked across and saw me i waved
a friendly hand

  hey mr simpson he called excitedly
were stuck out here i stopped to let this
guy get the wort of his money he was
down on his hands an knees a beggin to be
took back an now hes layin here on the
floor croaked or somethin he flopped over
when i couldnt start her again honest i
cant start her whatll i do

  youre scared honk told him try
it again disconnect and examine your coils
maybe youve got a hot bearing somewhere
the kid did some more tinkering and
swore that he couldnt locate the trouble high
or low

  why dont your friend take command
now i asked honk he could fire em
out of the torpedo tube honk glowed at
me

  youre to blame for this he growled
its serious its just a question of the
gyroscope running down in ten or twelve
hours and they will fall off

  go out and fix it then i said take
my umbrella if you want to

  honk seemed to be alarmed all right for
he set out on a dog - trot for town in half

an hour he returned on a wheel with a bag
of tools and one of those little pulley-car-
riages the telephone linemen ride in when
theyre putting up overhead cables daunt-
less dick had revived and fainted again
and buttsey had partly lost his nerve

  honk hooked on his little wagon and went
jiggling merrily out i doubt if he enjoyed
it as much as i did he didnt look it it
took him ten minutes to locate and adjust
the hitch when he got aboard and the hard-
est part was getting aboard

  of course it was dangerous but i
couldnt help smiling a little honk got
sore because i did too

  the car rolled on the solid earth again
and stopped we gave dick the artificial
respiration treatment and rubbed and wal-
lowed him back to consciousness he was a
reformed daredevil and no mistake he
was gentle as a lamb

  look at his hair i exclaimed horror-
stricken  hes getting gray

  it was true when we got richard the
lionheart back to valhalla his hair was as
white as the whiskers of an amateur santa

here are some railroad stories that are spick-and-span and new just

from the shops ready for their
first run

tit for tat

two elderly spinsters were bound for duluth
in the hurry and flutter of the railroad jour-
ney they rushed aboard the train before thinking
of the necessary formality of purchasing tickets

after securing seats the elder of the two be-
thought herself of the tickets and hurried out to
the ticket-sellers window fluttering with excite-
ment her nerves all on edge she rushed up to the
window gesticulating and shouted to the agent
 two-to-duluth  two-to-duluth  

the dispenser of the pasteboards looked up and
never batting an eye waved back and answered

a kind-hearted conductor bent over the little
fellow and sought to learn the cause of his grief

how it happened

a boomer brakeman being the only survivor
of a rear-end collision was called upon the
carpet to tell how the accident occurred

 you see it was this way he said

we was mopin around the curve about sixtv-
five miles per when i looked out and seen a stack
of reds on the main

  i gave the grand hailin sign of distress and
notified the skillet-head on the front end he
throwed her into the breechin on two pipes of sea-
shore he give her the secret works and began to
sound the bugle-call

  then i makes a high dive and disappeared into
the atmosphere

  that will be all said the superintendent  you
are excused

smoke in the smoker

all the cars being crowded one hot day last
summer on the train which runs between
vallejo and suisun california a number of wom-
en and children took seats in the smoking-car
with the result that all pipes went out and several
half-smoked cigars disappeared through the open
window

   all but one however says the old civil war
veteran who tells us the story  and that was a
vile weed in the mouth of a young smarty wearing
a cheap suit who stood in the doorway letting the
nauseating fumes of his cigar sweep back into the
faces of the women and children

  i finally became so disgusted that i went over
to him and said young man if you will throw
that stinker away ill give you ten cents

   the young hoodlum only laughed and said
 now if you had said fifty cents i might do it
well fifty cents then i replied but before
i pay it i want to tell you that if the chinese vho
made that cigar was here to see you smoking it
hed go home and tell his folks how proud he was
that he wasnt a white man

   smarty tried to answer back but i had the
whole car laughing at him by that time and was
ready to put on the finishing touches

young man i said i have used tobacco for




the railroad mans magazine

more than fifty-five years but ill be hanged if i
ever saw the time when i didnt have sense enough
to quit smoking in the presence of women and
children

that was enough for smarty however he
had thrown away his cigar and darted into the
car ahead to get away from the storm of laughter
and hand-clapping vhich greeted my remarks

 for the rest of the trip the smoker was smoke-
less

                        

a mixed message

view new jersey in which a death had

the engineers joke

not long ago a new road was built into car-
rizo springs texas and on the day that
the first train was run into town the farmers had
gathered from all over the country to watch for its
arrival many of them never having seen one be-
fore they were sitting on the platform and on
the roof of the station when the engineer brought
the train in at full speed

  as he slowed down he put his head out of the
window and yelled  look out im going to turn
around  and the farmers badly frightened scat-
tered in all directions

   i thought that if he was going to turn around
he would have to do like we do when we turn a
wagon one of them was heard to remark as he
walked sheepishly back to the station with the rest
of the crowd

why bart was there

 i advised mr martin that the
 roadmaster would report to him
 in a few minutes and as no one
 seemed anxious that i remain in
 the special car i went over to
 my dog-house where i knew i
 would be more at home

    going -through the private car i caught
  another glimpse of the young lady and a
  dignified elderly woman who i found out
  later was her mother when i reached the
  caboose bart was in an awful stew

     wheres your comb and hair-brush  
 he asked with a show of irritation

    i removed my hat bringing into view a
 dome which is as devoid of hair as a pool
 ball

     does that look like a loafing-place for
  hair i asked then remembering that
  dude bowling always carried a kit of
  tools in his pocket i volunteered to see what
  i could do for him bart finally got his
  crop of black locks placed to suit him and
  although he didnt look entirely happy he
  climbed over to the platform of the private
  car and went in

    if i could have cashed that mind bet
 i won during the night i would have been
 glad to give up half of it for a reserved
 seat back there for i felt sure that some-
 - thing was going to come off that would be
 worth watching even if a fellow couldnt
 have a ring-side seat

    however as it was an invitation affair
  i had to crawl out on top of the cupola and
  let my feet hang overhand try to figure out

what kind of a new game i had encoun-
tered	

  of course a fellow forgets the ordinary
things which occur on a trip just as soon
as he has made out his trip ticket and fig-
ured up his overtime

  i had met up with a few unexpected and
peculiar events in my time but none of them
resembled this one and i couldnt help but
wonder if bart was really count von
sneeze in disguise or an embezzling bank
cashier hiding out

  this was the one thing i was unable to put
out of my mind

  when we rattled over the high switch at
winslow bart had not returned from the
conference in the general managers car i
took m- time washing up even polished my
head and tried to get a little mud off those
good black trousers and still bart did not
show up

  as my flue sheet felt as if it was just
about to drop if i didnt get a cup of java
and a sinker pretty quick i wandered up
to the stat n registered in and proceeded
to wrap my legs about a lunch-counter stool
and order about a dollars worth of ham and
eggs

  and still bart failed to show up

  knowing that within a few hours the call-
boy would be after me to serve the rest of
my sentence on the cinder train i went over
to the adobe to grab what little shut-eye
might be waiting for me after i once got
those tight shoes off my feet and stretched
out in bed i started in to figure out just
what this bart goldie affair really was
and id be willing to bet a hundred hat-
checks that i would have figured it out in-
side an hour if i hadnt gone to sleep

began in the september railroad mans magazine single copies  cents

  when a fellow has been up all night
wrestling box cars and fighting to keep him-
self from hitting some lop-eared wise-head
like bennett in the nose no sentimental love
flair not even his own is going to keep
him awake

  you know the honorable charles flynn
used to hand out a morsel of wisdom as a
premium with every sale and the last pair
of gloves i bought over there brought me
this without any extra charge  a railroad
man has just as good a job as a king when
hes asleep however that may be for the
next eight hours i was satisfied with every-
body and everything

  when  finally opened my eyes goldie
had come in when he saw that i was
in my right mind again he did a most un-
expected thing

  why dont you hire that snore of yours
out to the roundhouse for a whistie   he
asked

  i thought that was real fair for goldie-
the nearest to a joke he ever had approached
voluntarily any one could see that he was
in a festive state of mind i couldnt have
been more surprised if he had started to
sing loves old sweet song

  dont get fresh young fellow just be-
cause you have been hobnobbing with an
official where have you been all day i
asked in the hope that he would say some-
thing of vital interest

   in martins car most of the time in
arnolds office the rest of it

  well anvthing startling

  yes he replied several tilings
then he went to playing  marching
through georgia or who killed paddys
goat with his finger on the table and him
a knowing all the time that the sewing so-
ciety was waiting for a wee bit of gossip
so to speak

  for one thing he began after a time
we are going to run the cinder pit one
month longer this year than they did last
and ive asked mr arnold to see that you
have one of the work trains as long as the
pit is worked

   oh thanks and again thanks kind
sir i spouted at him  for good behavior
the prisoner will be allowed to serve another
month after his regular term

  after that is done continued bart we
will put in a gravity pipe-line from the lake
on bill williams mountain to winona and
do away with the hauling of water over
there

  why not tap niagara falls or pump the

water from the colorado river into the grand
canon-

   and if they follow out my suggestion
we will put in reinforced concrete bridges
and culverts over the entire third division
 bart i growled from the depths of my
shirt which refused to go on because the
sleeves were wrong side out you talk like
a rusty phonograph

   its no wonder ive been talking all
day i had to convince every one that these
things were possible and for the ultimate
good of the road

    of course all this conversation was very
interesting to me in view of the fact that
i was thinking of the young lady bart
dropped into silence and seemed to have
gone so far in that there was no chance
of his getting out alone so i threw him a
line

   by the way miss martin isnt as good-
looking as one would expect a general man-
agers daughter to be

    whats the matter with her looks  
snapped bart

   her hair is too gray and the wrinkles
in her face-

   oh you saw mrs martin lois has
dark hair and brown eyes

   well that sounded a little closer to the
real news so i tried again

   thats funny i thought the young
woman was the hired girl she seemed
rather interested in watching you at the
wreck last night

  how do you know asked bart with
real interest

    i saw her standing down near the wreck
for almost half an hour

    that accounts for it

  that accounts for what i asked
for her lack of surprise when i-say
what are you after anyhow information
well ill tell you bart im trying to
save my life if i dont get the straight
of this affair pretty soon im going to ex-
pire

  bart goldie threw has head back and
roared the roar gradually simmered to a
cackle and ended in a series of silent spasms
which shook all of his six feet of anatomy
if a fellow could sell that kind of a laugh
by the can he could make a fortune by the
time he finished i had inhaled enough of
the fumes to produce a grin on my own
face

  when he had enough of it out of his
system to allow him to talk he said

  you old woman the idea of a man
on short time



reaching the age where lie speaks of the
hair on his head as  it and still being
hungry for gossip well baldy i have a
mind to tell you all about it ill have to
tell some one pretty soon or theres going to
be an explosion

   go as far as you like bart youve got
the main line all to yourself

  thats just how i came to find out that
the honorable charles flynn was abso-
lutely correct and bartholomew e golds-
worthy came to arizona on account of his
family troubles and his family troubles
came along as a second section and caught
up with him

   it wouldnt be right to unload all he told
me that evening and i couldnt begin to
tell it like he did for there are  mandolins
and guitars playing in the distance no
arizona dusk no great big sense of loneli-
ness to make up the proper setting

  after bart goldie had drifted through
the sheep-skin factory he apparently-awoke
to the fact that he had wasted about four
years of his life and a whole lot of the
governors money cultivating a football
crop of hqlr

  as the governor wasnt in the mattress
business he didnt have much use for hair
and i guess there must have been a little
stormy conversation after which the governor
locked the safe which held the incubating
bonds and went home informing bart that
when he had amounted to something more
than a village sport with its hair parted
in the middle he would be glad to have him
come into the business

  it seems as if bart grew real peevish
about it and informed the governor that he
could get along without a parental helper
even if lie had to double the hills and they
let the matter rest right there

  but i guess that while bart put up a loud
whistle the steam was really very low he
didnt say as much but by plain addition
and subtraction i figured out that he was
just about to ask a young lady to marry
him banking on father for the price of the
marriage license and the first months rent

  the young lady was lois martin he had
met her in college and having been the
genuine football hero he was a favorite in
the betting

   after the governor cut the train line bart
began to think it over he couldnt ask the
girl  to live in a box car when she had been
used to a pullman and he seemed to realize
that he wasnt going to have a great deal of
lack when he tried to persuade her father

when technically speaking he should have
been arrested for having no visible means of
support

  he knew that martin was a railroad offi-
cial and at that time he was connected with
an eastern trunk line and believing if he
too went out and made good at the railroad
game papa would be more apt to favor him
lie started out gaily as a light extra for the
west

  a year passed without seeing bart made
president of a road he kept going far-
ther west until he landed at winslow and
fell into the place of roadmaster of the third
division in the meantime the eastern trunk
line by one of those juggling stunts came
into control of the a and p and martin
was sent out in the capacity of general man-
ager to improve the property and bring it
up to the standard of theeastern road

  thats about the how of it im not say-
ing that miss martin could not have given
the why of it in a very interesting way for
an innocent bachelor who dont know more
than enough to enable him to sign the dotted
line on the orders and copy car and seal
numbers should never speculate on what a
woman might say

  i will venture this much that if she had
known that bart goldie was doing his lapse
working day and night like a heathen for-
getting to go after his pay-check about half
the time just in the hope of some day
amounting to something more than a section
boss or a roadmaster she would have been
mighty proud of him no matter what kind
of a woman she was

   im going to have this woman some
day remarked goldie that evening when
he saved my life id have died if he had
not told me  and before i have her i must
make good make good in a big way
baldy ill do it some day but it has to be
soon im afraid some one will rob me
of the one woman in the world im running
on short time-thats what worries me

  of course im not much at advising in
a love affair but bart was so earnest about
it i had to say something

  yes i understand i said although
he knew i didnt understand and i knew it
too  youre  short time bart but the
tracks straight and if she aint asleep at the
switch shell see your headlight coming and
keep in the clear until you arrive

  i dont suppose that meant very much to
him in the way of encouragement but if he
had known that i was so cock-sure that he
was going to pick up the girl that i bet my-


the railroad mans magazine 

self a million dollars against my last insur-
ance receipt he would have felt better

  yes sir i made that odds-on bet just 
form if i had waited another month i
would have doubled it for after bart goldie
found that lois martin was in our neck of
the woods he began to make things move

  when he started he went some place you
never found him waiting on a siding he
was always on the main line and he had a
way of making things go that made a hit
with every man on the division

  you know just how nervous a fellow feels
when he finds hes on short time you leave
the last station with more than running time
in which to make your meet and get about
half-way over when you find a box so hot
it has to be packed at once

  again the hog gets to slipping or wont
steam and one minute follows the other un-
til you look at your watch and find that
you have just enough time to get there with-
out figuring for the five minutes in the clear
you do the hurdle race over the tops for
the head-end and find the eagle-eve with his
watch in his hand and the fireman just
about to get down and push by that time
you have eight miles to go in eight minutes
on a grade that would be steep for a flying
machine you know you should run for it
with a flag and youre not sure but that even
then the old man is going to present you
with a bunch of brownies or a tin can and
finally you decide to take a chance

  there is just one more curve and then its
straight track and you keep chugging away
promising yourself that if you get out of
this without losing a piece of your cuticle
you will establish squatters rights on the
next side-track if you hkveht enough time
to make the next station and clear by a week

  you get around the last curve onto the
straight-away you see the other fellow fog-
ging into the station four miles beyond and
you wonder if there is any possible chance
of his having gone blind since the doctor
examined his eyes of course the other
fellow is just as anxious to avoid a main-
line meet as you are and while he blusters
around a bit when you crawl in ever the
switch with your tail between your legs you
know that he knows that the next day you
will probably be waiting for him and he
will be dealing in short time

  i suppose bart felt the same way mar-
tins headquarters were in san francisco
and the family made its home there a large
number of fellows in san francisco are in
the market for housekeepers and there was

always the chance that some fellow would
come along and take barts running orders
and go ahead of him

  while he never said as much im sure
that worried him as much as anything else

  a few days after bart and i were back
on the cinder-pit work we were in the
clear one morning at bellemont for no 
we happened to be standing at the east
switch when the varnished wagons came in
and when they stopped martins private car
which was on the rear was just opposite us
and miss martin and her mother were out on
the observation platform

  bart saw her just as quickly as she saw
him she beckoned to him and he went over
for a chat no  had cleared our switch
by fifty feet and if i had been a real con-
ductor i would have pulled out but  waited
for bart to have his little talk and when
no  began to move it looked for a time
as if bart was going to hang on the end
gate however he finally let go and with a
wave of his hand came back to earth and
the cinder train-his face glowing like one
of those electric signs

  i never had to work so hard in all my
life as i did the rest of that day it looked
as if bart wanted to pull down that cinder
mountain and haul it away to ballast the
track from bellemont to albuquerque not
less than three hundred and fifty miles be-
fore quitting time

  that was on friday morning i know be-
cause we had mackerel for breakfast and
sardines for supper sunday morning bart
said he was going over to williams for the
day on a little personal business and that
he would not be back until the local mon-
day morning he told where he wanted the
work to begin on monday and i promised to
have a string of loads ready to leave when
he came in

  i knew that the grand canon was just
sixty-three miles from williams and that
no  connected widi the plug which went
out of the canon in the morning coming
back at night in time to catch the night lim-
ited which went through the cinder pit like
a fellow who never had smallpox going by
a pest-house

  but i didnt say a word if he wanted to
go around spending sunday in riotous liv-
ing when he should have been resting up so
that he would be able to earn his money
that was his business

  just to show how valuable a man he was
the pit opened monday morning the same as
if he had been there i told him when he
on short time



got back that he hadnt missed him a bit
and so far as i was concerned he could take
every other sunday off if he wanted to i
had torty loads coupled up and the engine
on them a long time before the local showed
up

  however when the local did come bart
was on it at first when he dropped off the-
caboose i wasnt sure it was bart for he
looked more like a traveling man from a
gents furnishing-houste than he did like
bart goldie or a roadmaster

  he had a brand-new outfit from his shoes
to the black hat a real white shirt and a
stand-up collar that reminded me of the
sand fence down near hardy a gray suit
which while it wasnt as noisy as some ive
seen was pretty loud for a quiet little ham-
let like the cinder pit where about the only
things of color were the cook the water-flag
and the semaphore

  he was carrying a suit-case one of those
kind which keep a fellow guessing whether
its full of thousand-dollar bills or interest-
bearing bonds and he wore the clothes and
carried the suit-case just as if they belonged
to him

  he didnt go over to the pit after he
alighted from the local walked up to me
first and asked

  hows everything how soon will you
be ready to start out with your train

   everything is in better shape than its
been this year i replied taking off my hat
and standing on one foot  my train has
been waiting since daybreak for you to
show up

  i thought that might take some of the
starch out of his shirt he only smiled and
started i the caboose

  lets to then im ready he said
and a fe minutes later we were bumping
over the switch and with that once closed
and dude bowling in his usual roost on
top i went inside took my hat and began
dusting off the office-chair and making things
just as tidy as i could

  but my efforts failed to appeal to bart
he opened up the fancy carpetbag took out
his old khaki suit and started to change his
clothes during the operation i endeavored
to extract a few morsels of information

  how did you find everything at wil-
liams i asked

    oh all right he answered

   be quite a place if it had more houses
dont you think 

  bart was trying to get out of that white
shirt without using a can-opener and he

   	rr

failed to reply after he had solved the
puzzle i continued

  nice place to spend sunday

  yes he replied and i didnt know
whether it was a question or an answer

   have a good time over at the grand
canon 

  i naturally expected him to show a little
surprise for he had never told me he was
going to the canon but he took it very com-
mon-like

   fine its a great place

   yes i replied  it is quite a hole
in the ground i remember when old man
cameron started to build it did you see
cameron  

  no answered bart which was rather
surprising for cameron runs the one hotel
and if you eat there you have to see him

   go down the bright angel trail   i
asked

  no i didnt have time explained the
roadmaster which is rather peculiar for
everybody who goes to the grand canon goes
down the trail because its about the only
place to go

  did you see that mountain of green rock
right at the end of the spur where they al-
ways set out the special cars

  yes replied bart i believe i did

  now there never was a mountain of green
rock so far as i know and i was thoroughly
convinced that bart had not seen much of
the scenic landscape

  mr martins car was supposed to be
at die canon bart did you see it

   yes i saw it

  you mean you saw her dont you i
questioned determined to show him that i
was a pretty wise old head even if i had
never been in a divorce court bart looked
up at me with a sheepish grin and im sure
he would have confessed if it had not been
for the fact that when the engine hit the
grade beyond bellemont the slack run back
and one of the drawbars came out bringing
with it an end-sill

  bart found himself looking for minnows
in the water-keg and i went to a finish
catch-as-catch-can with the caboose stove
of course i was giving away lots of weight
but i think i could have won the match if
the stove hadnt put a toe-hold on me and
when bart pulled the stove off i couldnt
get up my leg was broken in two places
that was once i didnt have to help chain
up

  ill go over and help them tie the cars
together and as soon as we get to riordan


the railroad mans magazine

we will take you in to winslow and they
can fix you up at the hospital said bart
as he left the caboose

        chapter iv
        the other man

tit aving found the united states of

  a america rather small and crowded at
times a hospital made a big hit with me
i guess i had been sleeping on a board bunk
so long that i couldnt appreciate a little
white crib with lace on the blankets a fel-
low who has grown accustomed to tying his
legs in a slip-knot round a lunch-counter
stool doesnt relish his rations when they are
dished up on a tin boiler-head alongside his
bed as they had one of my legs strapped
to a railroad tie i wasnt in a very good po-
sition to make much of a protest

  it would not have been so bad if i had
not realized that there were things going on
up around the cinder pit and the grand
canon which while they didnt exactly touch
on my future happiness made my condition
a little restless it was just like missing a
couple of chapters in a continued story

  denny reagan dropped in ever- now and
then to tell me the news-but when a fellow
is feeling seven kinds of pain in his leg and
has a chronic grouch he cant become inter-
ested in such common little things as the
stripping of the  and the smashing of
tim joness caboose

  after i had been hanging around the
nursery for about a week bart came in over
sunday which was all the evidence i needed
to convince me that private car no  and
the general managers family had left the
grand canon and while bart said very little
about the young lady he did keep me pretty
well posted on what was going on along the
third division

  by the time i had been cribbed up on
crutches so that i could hobble about the
ballasting was almost completed and bart
was starting in to build the concrete bridges

  every man who came around the hospital
had something to say about the quality and
quantity of work which had been done by
the new roadmaster since he came on the job
and when a fellow does a whole lot of ood
work its a safe bet he has an inspiration
back of him i knew that so far as bart
was concerned he still had hopes

  after about three weeks i began to get
accustomed to my hospital surroundings
and decided that thev were not half bad

for several years i had been paying one
dollar ever- month from my check for the
hospital fund and while i had the chance

i made up my mind to get my moneys
worth

  it grated on my nerves to think of a big
rough-neck like myself being waited on by
a trim miss in a blue-and-white striped
dress and a fussy little marker in the way
of a white cap

  at first i really balked but while i was
flat on my back i had to stand for it and
by the time i was able to sit up i rather
liked it

  miss fowler was one of those trained
nurses who knew more about people than
the doctors do she came from some cross-
road town in kansas as i passed through
that state once we felt like we were old
acquaintances she knew the union depot in
kansas city and remembered the big lin-
seed mill at fredonia and she had a brother
working in the shops at newton-well you
know i knew all those places like a book

  it was just like meeting somebody from
home and we would talk about old times
whenever she could leave the other patients

  i reached the place where i thought she
was a real amiable little woman and when i
hobbled over to the harvey house for dinner
the first time i asked her to go along and
im a goat if she didnt go we had some-
thing to eat and quite a bit of conversation
but i dont recall any particular item on
the switch-list

  mending a broken leg especially where
there is only one nurse and a doctor to help
keeps one awfully busy and for a few weeks
i almost forgot to worry about bart

  i felt mighty ashamed of myself when he
came strolling over to the hospital veranda
one sunday afternoon after i had served six i
weeks of my time he looked just as big
as he did the first day i saw him he had
burned almost copper but aside from that
he was all right-just the kind of man who
would set a womans heart palpitating like 
an overworked air-pump and i was glad 
miss fowler was busy inside the building 

  bart put in an hour giving me a train- i
book record of events on the third division
he was just popping off with enthusiasm -
and i was somewhat surprised but none the 
less pleased to note that his affair had
been progressing very satisfactorily even
though i had been asleep on the worry job

i think bart was just about ready to crack a
joke when our little lodge meeting was rude-
ly nterrupted by the arrival of something
on short time



  im not sure to this day what it really
was it wore one of those greasy black
stacks a walking-stick varnished kicks with
gunnysacks wrapped about the tops of them
a bartenders vest a preachers coat and its
trousers might have come from holland-or
may have been bloomers

   i felt rather sorry for the fellow at first
for he had lost one of the glasses from his
specs and he sure had a hard tune keeping
the one remaining in his eye

  he came up on the veranda and asked
one of the bad-order squad if mr golds-
worthy was about bart spoke right up and
pleaded guilty to being the party

  ah indeed how fortunate said the
bunch of clothing as he cocked his head to
one side and squinted at bart through that
one bulls-eye  i am mr smartley con-
sulting engineer for the western district
and he announced the fact as if he fully
expected bart to kneel at the mention of the
name

  after bart had acknowledged the intro-
duction and pulled up another chair the
two men sat down and bart introduced me

  i cant say that i had any ambition to
make the gentlemans acquaintance know-
ing that the two men would probably want
to talk over official matters i excused my-
self and taking my props started out to see
if miss fowler didnt think it was a beau-
tiful afternoon just as i was leaving i
heard the human show-window say

   ah mr goldsworthy i am out heah to
look ovah the ballasting work you know
mr matin wished that i should come out
you know and see that the work was pro-
gressing mr matins very particular
about track-work you know and i assured
him prior to my leaving san francisco that
i would see that everything was all right
out this way

  he talked as if he had a pound of waste
in his maw i made bets with myself that
every time that fellow got  real mad he
swore like a boomer switchman i can hear
him standing up straight and angrily nib-
bling the end of his walking-stick and mut-
tering oh crowbars or some other vul-
gar word

  i never could like that hog-head rigley
from the second district he doesnt know
enough about running an engine to turn one
on a y  hes as homely as a mud-
house after a hard rain and if he dont
use cylinder oil as a hai-r tonic ill swallow
half a dozen car-seals and i dont claim to
be a human ostrich

  he certainly robbed the farm of a good
plow-pilot when he went railroading and i
cant see what any woman could find to
admire about him hes so tight he has
to use a cold chisel on his pocketbook every
time he opens it and he buys a new suit of
overalls every other year whether he needs
them or not

  the day he bought his last pair he was
looking into the front end of an engine to see
what pushed the smoke out the stack when
he slipped and fell he landed square on
his back got up and was all right until he
looked down and discovered he had ripped
his new overalls which cost him six bits
over at the honorable charles flynns em-
porium

  immediately he got so sick that he had
to go to the hospital he was just about
over the shock and ready to leave the nur-
sery when he got to figuring how much
money he had lost by being off for two
weeks and when he had the figures where
he could see them he suffered a relapse

  when i came into the big ward and found
him sitting beside miss fowler smiling and
showing how crooked his face really was i
didnt say oh crowbars i guess its
nobodys business what i said but any fel-
low who will thrust his acquaintance on an
innocent nursegirl ought to have his face
punched i sure would have wanted to do
the job if it hadnt been that watching
them i didnt notice that some fellow had
left a chair standing on the main line and
my bad-order peg collided with it

  that bump hurt so bad i could feel it in
my teeth and before i knew it id yelled
right out in meeting hang that chair
which is a hungalusian word a fellow cant
translate into polite english

  miss fowler rushed over and helped me
to a chair and said more by keeping her
mouth shut than most women could by talk-
ing all day but rigley-well he came
over bringing that homely mug of his along
and asked

   did it hurt much 

  no i replied hurt why thats
part of the treaunent for broken legs i do
that three times a day after each meal it
tickles like old harry but its mighty good
for the digestion

  i guess that woke him up to the fact that
there were red lights hanging out for him
around my station and he went on out to
the veranda and left miss fowler to tell me
how sorry she was that i had stubbed my
tee and as i didnt want lvr to be tronblihg


the railroad mans magazine

her mind about me i let on as if it did not
hurt and we went to talking about the
weather and sand and things and an hour
later i was feeling so good that i would
have been willing to kick the stuffings out
of even piece of furniture in the nursery if
miss fowler had asked me to

  when miss fowler finally had to go to the
private ward to give a patient his chocolate
candy i put my one good wheel into action
and headed for the place where i had left
bart talking to the big  what-is-it

  that fellow was the real human phono-
graph - yes and then some he was a
pianola a moving-picture show and a steam-
calliope all in one it seemed like his
safety-valve had stuck and he couldnt quit
popping off

  i thought he would talk himself to death
before he got away he told bart all the
inside plans of our road and gave him a
personal history of every official from aki
angazawaza the jap janitor to the presi-
dent of the road to hear him tell it he
was the confidant and chief adviser of them
all and as for old man martin-well it
seemed that after all martin was only a
feeble-minded old maid and that if it had
not been for smartley he wouldnt have been
able to hold his job a minute

   ah yes mr goldsworthy he said to
bart after i came up  i am very close to
mr martin you know dine at his home
quite often-in fact rawther one of the
family you know his daughter lois and
i are rawther old chums you know which
reminds me that lois insisted that i give
you her greetings and express her wish that
you are doing well in your new-er-job
and it kept rambling about that way until i
began to look for the lever to shut it off

  finally he got to the end of the record
at least he began to slow up a bit i think
he must have caught sight of barts face
it looked like the off-side of a cyclone cloud
just before it starts in to make an omelet of
the village church and the town hall hang the
fish-pond on the picket fence and put the
garret two stories below the basement

  quite an enjoyable talker i said to
bart after the eye-glass got out of hearing
what is he bart missionary or insurance
man  

  that said bart talking more to him-
self than to me  that must be the other man
in the case and then he told me he
would be in town for a few days and would
see me again before he went out on the
next inspection trip as he walked away i

thought there was a sort of droop to his big
shoulders

  just the same i sized up the situation
and just taking a chance on form i bet
myself four million dollars worth of pen-
nies that if the man with the one eye-glass
was really the other man in the running
bart would beat him to the station have his
train put away be washed up and ready
for supper before the other fellow whistled
for the high switch

  it looked to me like a mogul racing with
a steam shovel i says to myself miss
martin if its between those two men just
give me one guess and ill tell you what
your other name will be after the matri-
monial orders have been signed up

  then i went back into the big ward to
see if miss fowler had changed her mind
about it being abeautiful afternoon

 -

chapter v
 make another wager

l h en i finally got my discharge from
the hospital being unable to go back
to work at once i put in most of my time as
chief cook and bottlewasher over at the
adobe between that and endeavoring to see
that some fellow didnt hang around the
hospital too long i was fairly busy

  bart spent more time in the terminal after
the ballasting had been completed and as
he had insisted on making our housekeeping
experiment a permanent arrangement we
were together a great deal in fact almost
every evening that i wasnt reporting to miss
fowler he and i sat out in front of the adobe
and discussed the policy of the road if
some of the officials could have attended our
little meetings they would have received a
great deal of valuable information on how 
to operate a transcontinental trunk line

  it was a good thing that there was no 
paint on the adobe for there were times 
when bart came home from the office workt 
ing steam through the stack and so all-fired 
mad that he could have bitten the head off
a ten-penny nail

  hed sputter and blow until he reminded j
me of an engine on a frosty morning when j
you can hardly see the head end on account c-
of the steam hed bring home a cloud of
indigo language that would hide all of his 
six feet of anatomy two hours afterward
i would be able to glean from choice par- 
tides of language that he had received a
letter from mr fllington wallerheit smart-
on short time



ley who besides wearing a walking-stick
and a monocle drew a salary for being
advisory engineer for the western lines

  according to bart goldie smartley didnt
know a knot-hole from a gasket or a crow-
bar from a hat-pin bart said that if smart-
ley worked twenty-four hours a day for a
full year including holidays and was paid
for just what he earned he wouldnt have
enough money on pay-day to buy a gingham
apron for a lady-ant

  whether that was true or not it did seem
reasonable that a fellow in san francisco
could not see the conditions in winslow a
thousand miles away as well as the man
right on the job especially so when the
fellow doing the long-distance seeing only
had a half-pair of eye-glasses

  i know just how i feel when some newly-
promoted clerk sends me a two-page exhibit
of large words telling me why i should be
able to switch every car in ash fork yards
in thirty minutes when if lie had to do it
himself he would have a lifetime job

  ive come home more than once feeling as
if i wanted to knock the cobwebs off the
ceiling with the furniture and i guess goldie
felt the same way

  far be it from me to give my approval to
insubordination but if bart had told that
fellow in san francisco to go fishing for
salt in the sea i would have said  amen

  but bart didnt come home wanting to
scratch the varnish and kick down the door
on all occasions it seems as if he got other
letters than those which came in his railroad
mail

  i saw one of them on the table one day
and it was addressed in a hand too light for
a man and too heavy for an old maid in
trying to read the post-office stamp on it i
got so close that i caught a whiff of per-
fume and i just gave myself three guesses
as to who wrote that letter and then never
used two of them

  if the writing and the san francisco post-
mark were not sufficient evidence to convince
me that lois martin was the writer some
of the fool things bart said and did after he
got that letter cinched my belief

  the night he brought that letter home
with him we took our chairs out in front of
the adobe and bart began to talk of build-
ing railroads down the grand canon double-
tracking to mars and swinging a suspension
bridge between new york and london
that night he would have taken a contract
to put in a subway between los angeles and
denver

  he told me positively that the man who
picked out the right-of-way for the third
division should have been surveying for a
rail fence he said the third division was
just fifty-three miles longer than it really
ought to be not counting several miles wasted
in going up and down he started out by
showing me that a straight line is the short-
est distance between two points he went
on for an hour about hypotenuses and hypo-
dermics and epileptics until i began to think
that bart really knew something

  he went  to show that other things
being equal by adding the wheel-base of
the locomotive to the length of the rail and
multiplying the result by the- number of
toothpicks in a tie plus the square root
of the number on the caboose gave a sum
equal to what a baldwin hog could pull on
a twenty-per cent grade provided the con-
ductor and the rear shack didnt drag their
feet

  this sum when gently mixed in a bucket
of warm water would leave a residue which
when divided by the number on the engine
would be the cube root of the price of beans
when mississippi went republican

  having explained these elemental truths
to me bart went on to say that if the track
from supai to ash fork was built in a
straight line it would be shorter than it was
running around the neighborhood without its
parents

  now says bart i propose to suggest
to mr martin that we build a cut-off from
supai to ash fork running the track down
the left side of johnsons canon-

  he said a few other things but while i
was willing to indulge him there was a
limit when a man begins to talk about
building a railroad down the side of john-
sons canon i pass the book and ask for a
new deal johnsons canon is three hun-
dred feet deep if its an inch and a rocky
mountain goat would stand more of a chance
to walk up bunker hill monument on its
horns than it would to climb out of john-
sons canon  its feet

  not only that half-way down the
caiion if you are on the left side the
big crack turns sharply to the right for a
half-mile and doubles back again making
an imperfect v not-only was bart plan-
ning to build a railroad along the wall of
this canon but he was dreaming of tun-
neling almost three-quarters of a mile across
what would be the top of the v in order
to avoid the extra mileage out to the sharp
point of the v and return

  when he went to stringing me with that
kind of stuff i thought it was time to flag
him

   bart- i said  thats a fine piece of
track youre building a train would go
down it like a sled down a steeple but
what i cant see is how youre going to get
back up

  bart looked at me in amazement there
was an element of pity in his look too

   i gave you the figure to prove that the
grade would only be four per cent when i
started out he said and i detected an ele-
ment of bitter disappointment in his tone
just as if he realized for the first time that
i lacked brains

   oh i replied  those figures-yes i
remember i thought you were trying to
beat a differential rate without violating the
laws of the interstate commerce commis-
sion

  bart looked at me a moment and even in
the dusk i could see that undershot jaw of
his set

  baldy he finally remarked dont
think im joking about this matter ive
been all over that canon up there and i
know it can be done i can shorten the third
division over fifty miles and decrease the
grade some day we will build that piece
of track

  when bart goldie said we will-well
i thought so well of the proposition that i
just bet myself a bushel of twenty-dollar
gold pieces against a peck of gallup coal
that we would

  of course after i met bart goldie i won
a lot of money - making mind bets but i
couldnt cash my tickets at the harvey
house so just as soon as the bad-order card
was taken off my leg i joined the  first-in
first-out squad and went back to making
out trip slips and signing orders leaving as
much of the work as possible to the brake-
man

  a month or so rolled by and then the
orange crop began to move and i stayed
mighty close to my dog-house for every
time you got fifty yards away the call-boy
would run you back

  that fall i hardly had time to register at
the hospital between trips not to mention
getting over to the adobe and spending an
evening with bart a man who follows his
caboose when she is making better than six
thousand miles a month is too busy to give
much attention to love affairs especially
when they belong to some one else

  for that reason for several month-

goldie had to meet his battles alone and
without the wisdom and guidance which i
might have been able to donate had i been
less necessary to the general welfare of the
road those months slipped by unnoticed
because they brought nothing exceptional
except the pay-checks which as i didnt
have time to spend them i carried around
in my wallet

  there were few minor things to engage
ones time miss fowler being so far from
home and so much alone in the world
really became a source of concern and i
just had to take time to drop by the hos-
pital semi-occasionally and see that she was
getting along all right

  one evening when i went into the hos-
pital office she came in from the general
ward her poor little eyes swollen and red
her face streaked with tears and although
she tried to hide the handkerchief and greet-
ed me with a smile i knew that she was
being mistreated and durn me if i didnt
make a vow to whip the man just as soon
as i found out who he was

  we went out on the shady side of the porch
and talked a while she insisting all the
time that everything was right and me
knowing that she was bravely trying to hide
something finally i just couldnt stand it
any longer

   see here miss fowler i began de-
termined to have the truth at any cost
weve been friends for a long time and i
want you to feel that you can trust me
now youre in trouble-

  what makes you think so she asked
trying to dodge the point

  well im old enough to know the symp-
toms things have been going wrong either
here or at home and i-er-well if there
is anything i can do just ask me

  with that she pulls out the handkerchief
from that little pocket in her uniform and
presses it to her eyes again and didnt an-
swer so i continued

  im old enough to know you dont cry-
that way for nothing-

  she just threw back her head and laughed
like a hock of bells on new years night

   im not crying what makes you think
i am  

  cant i see didnt i notice how red
your eyes were when you came out of the
ward i guess i know tears when i see
them

  no no mr murray she says you
dont know a real tear when you see it
about an hour ago n the medicine closet i
on short time



knocked a bottle of ammonia off the shelf
it broke and some of it splashed in my face
and i got a real good whiff of it did you
ever take a real good long smell of an am-
monia bottle  

  i never had but just the same i was so
sorry about the accident and so concerned
about her eyes that i laid out red-ball 
just forty-five minutes to tell her how sorry
i was as the call-boy had given me a good
hour-and-a-lialf call i couldnt kick when
the old man hauled me up and gave me ten
brownies

  it just convinced me that a hospital is a
mighty dangerous place for a young woman
and miss fowler being so far from her rela-
tives i made up my mind to look after her
a little and looking after a young woman
that way and making every trip your ca-
boose makes in the orange season keeps a
fellow who isnt a twin awful busy i just
had to let poor old bart do the best he could

  first tiling i knew spring had followed
winter and the a and p had lost the big
transcontinental mail contract the gov-
ernment gave three roads a chance to make
a trial trip for speed with the understand-
ing that the best time won the contract

  the division had advance notice of the
mail special and everything was lined up
for a clear track the special came out of
albuquerque right on the dot topped the
big divide and came rolling down the sec-
ond division like a winning thoroughbred
it left pinto right on the dot and showed
up at huks tank just eleven miles away
six hours late old man bramble with
sknny mcceary on the head end left pinto
with plenty of time to make huks tank
and clear by a month of sundays but when
skinny threw the air into them to slow
down for the east switch a quick triple
valve about two-thirds the way back on the
eight-car train of empties got in its work

  when the mail train got down there it
looked as if they had pulled jap on the
team track in a junk yard there were
draw-bars and end-sills all over the country
that train only broke in seven pieces sev-
eral of the cars were derailed and with every-
body working as if they were trying to keep
out of jail it took six hours to get brambles
train in the clear and the scrap-iron off the
right-of-way

  everybody felt real cheerful about that
little stop over at the terminal the old
man was doing double flip-flops skating
about the office on his ear and juggling the
waste-basket on his feet

  he ordered every train on the third divi-
sion to stop right where it happened to be
and get into the clear and stay there the
order caught me over at crookton one hun-
dred and twenty miles from the terminal
and i went right into the clear and stayed
there by the time that mail train came by
i had proved up on my claim had the
ground platted into town lots and was just
starting to put in the paving

  when i finally got into the terminal i
found out just how it was when the mail
train lost six hours over at huks tank the
old man cleared the road ordered the 
a big prairie called  smoke  kelley to run
her out of his turn and none too gently
informed  smoke  that if he didnt pick up
three hours of that time over the third divi-
sion he could quit when he got to seligman

  that was just like a train-load of cash
fares for smoke when he went by fal-
stratt he had picked up an hour when he
shot by supai tank he had picked up fifty-
four minutes more then he hit that piece of
track down supai mountain where a snake
would break its back in seventeen pieces if
it went faster than a walk

  just to add to his troubles there were
slow orders out at two places down on the
fairbell curve he hit a piece of soft track
and by throwing her into the big hole
barely got enough air to keep the cars on the
track the pony truck of the engine dropping
down to the ties

  that hour and fifty-four minutes which
lie had picked up and another hour too
went by before  smoke  brought them on
down to the forks of course he burned
the rails from there over to the end of the
division but he couldnt make up very much
and the mail train went off the third divi-
sion as it had come on-just six hours late

  they say that the a and p lost the mail
contract by seven hours

  you know how it is when something hap-
pens like that the general manager writes
a sassy letter to the general superintendent
and asks why the general superin-
tendent finds some new words in the dic-
tionary repeats some old ones and says
 please note and answer immediately and
passes it on to the division superintendent

  when this worthy gets over his chill he
presents it with his compliments to the train-
master who slings a little ink on a nice
clean sheet of paper and thrusts it on the
chief despatcher who turns down a corner
and scratches  please explain  on it for
the benefit of the operator then it goes
s

the railroad mans magazine

back up the line and comes down on an-
other lead until die division master me-
chanic has a chance to see it

  the roundhouse foreman then passes it
to the night foreman who interviews a ma-
chinist who says it was the fault of the
night watchman who is no longer in the
service and the four hundred and eighty
dollars worth of paper and seven bottles of
ink goes back to the general manager who
by that time being unable to tell whether it
is a tracer for a bunch of hair-pins or a
requisition for postage stamps orders it filed
in the third story of the basement

  thats the way it usually goes-but not
in this case the papers came into the
hands of one bartholomew e goldsworthy
first out in the file was a letter from elling-
ton wallerheit smartley which besides in-
sinuating that some people didnt know the
first principles of track building ordered
the roadmaster of the third division to re-
port to him in san francisco as soon as
possible if not sooner

  it seems that superintendent arnold had
received the same order from general

manager martin for his private car was
coupled onto the same passenger train which
carried bart out of town

  i happened to be over at the depot that
morning just before bart got aboard he
showed me the file of papers with smart-
leys letter on top and said

   im going into headquarters not because
that fellow orders me in but to start some-
thing im going to show these people where
they can save seven hours on this division
im going to convince this smartley before
i get through that he dont know how to
build a street-car line and when i come
back ill either have no job or ill be fixed
so that fellow cant come in with an insult
like this every time he feels like it some-
bodys going to find a lot of trouble in his
back yard

  after the train had pulled out and i had
time to think it over i just entered a little
note in my train-book which read

   one thousand to one offered that bart
goldie makes smartley look like a hat-check
full of holes

  no takers

inglis-s custom of reaching his office before the

construction

by john walters

ross winanss eight-wheeled two-truck columbus designed for the balti-
more and ohio and how it gradually developed into the
model of later-day american car-builders

hen the first mile of the
baltimore and ohio rail-
road was graded west of
mount clare the board of
directors unable longer to
restrain their eager desire
to revel in the rapture of railroad travel had
the scrap-iron rails laid and hastily con-
structing a car which looked very much like
a farmers market-wagon hitched one horse
to it and prepared to open the road presi-
dent p e thomas william patterson alex-
ander brown and other directors and of
course charles carroll of carrollton who
as his fellow citizens perpetually- reminded
him signed the declaration of independence
piled in and away they went

  up and down that mile of track those dis-
tinguished citizens rode as happy as boys
with a new sled after they had satiated
their appetite for railroad travel the no less
eager common folk were permitted to step up
and gratify their curiosity at the moderate
price of twelve and a half cents a head

  the baltimore and ohio has never since
equaled the record made that day in the vol-
ume of traffic moved in proportion to its
facilities for its entire equipment was con-
stantly loaded to three hundred and fifty per
cent of its capacity in both directions

  the taste for travel thus engendered lasted
long and spread far as niav be judged by the

series began in the august  railroad

 following exceqdt from the baltimore gazette
 of july  

     notwithstanding the great heat of the
   weather for three weeks past the amount of
   travel on the railroad has not diminished the
   average receipts being much above a thou-
   sand dollars a week in the hottest time of
   the hottest days the quick motion of the cars
   causes a current of air which renders a ride
   at all times agreeable in many instances
   strangers passing through baltimore or visit-
   ing it postpone their departure for a day and
   sometimes longer to enjoy the pleasure of an
   additional ride on the railroad we only re-
   peat the general sentiment when we say it is
   the most delightful of all kinds of traveling

   so keen was the public interest in the rail-
 road and everything pertaining to it that in
   and  the arrivals and departures
 of freight-cars or  waggons as they were
 then called in imitation of the english cus-
 tom were chronicled as the movements of
 ships are now set forth in the marine depart-
 ment of a daily paper

   thus it was recorded in the baltimore pa-
 pers that on february   there arrived
 on the baltimore and ohio railroad 
 waggons containing  barrels of flour 
 tons of soapstone  bundles of leather 
 tons of granite anu  tons of wood de-
 parted  waggons with lumber plaster
 bricks groceries merchandise coal etc

  having aroused a slumbering appetite that
could not be controlled the board of directors
was in desperate straits for means to gratify
it the great question which confronted the
directors after that first ride was what is
a car

  they tried again and this time produced a
rude clapboard cabin set on four flanged
wheels without springs holding ten passen-
gers and with a perch for the driver outside
this contraption shocked the esthetic sensi-
bilities of richard imlay the famous coach
and carriage builder of baltimore who of-
fered to provide something better the board
was only too glad to have him do so

imlays masterpieces

  imlays first idea of a railroad car natu-
rally enough was simply an overgrown stage-
coach with leathern braces c springs and a
capacity of nine passengers for some time
these were all the fashion imlay felt so
proud of his handiwork that he nearly wiped
gut his profits in putting on extra flourishes
of gaudy paint

  each new triumph of his skill was set out
in monument square for the admiration of
all beholders for several days before being
turned over to the railroad company one
of imlays masterpieces named the  ohio
built in august  was described by the
baltimore american as being very elegant
it had seats for twelve inside and a seat at
each end for six including the driver while
on top was a double sofa placed lengthwise
with room for twelve more a wire netting
kept the passengers from falling off and an
awning protected them from the sun

  such handsome vehicles of course only
whetted the public appetite for railroad travel
and the time inevitably came when something
more capacious was demanded ross wi-
nans the great locomotive builder who never
failed to step into the breach when the balti-
more and ohio needed an idea thereupon
built the first eight-wheeled passenger-car
which he named the  columbus

  it was simply a large box with benches
inside and on top reached by a ladder at the
corner when the design was first submitted
to the board of directors they argued long
and eamesdy whether the new car should
have an aisle down the center or a narrow
ledge along the outside on which the con-
ductor could walk the advocates of the cen-
ter aisle won the day and the rough draft of
the american type of passenger-car was given
to the world

   its essential features were all there and it
seems now as if it should have been a simple
matter to develop the details as they were re-
quired but it was not on the contrary the
passenger-car reached its present state only
after a long struggle

   as in the case of every other feature of the
railroad the volunteers were prolific and per-
sistent in their proffers of solutions for all
problems pertaining to cars louis wern-
wag an architect of harpers ferry proudly
exhibited at the office of the charleston
virginia free press in august  a
model of his self-regulating or self-direct-
ing railroad-car wernwags idea was to
produce a car that could run around curves

  to accomplish this end he used six wheels
the center pair being the regulators from
this center-axle hounds or guiding poles led
to the other axles to guide them around the
curves the axles of the main wheels were
jointed in the center so that the outside wheel
in going around curves could travel the
faster the enthusiastic editor of the free
press declared

   we verily believe a car might be con-
structed on this plan to run around a com-
mon-sized haystack

  but haystacks not being a usual feature of
railroad equipment wernwags car did not
make a hit though six-wheeled cars quite as
extraordinary were actually operated on the
baltimore and susquehanna in  these
six-wheeled cars had wooden springs con-
sisting of white-ash planks  by  inches
and  feet long it was the proud boast
of the builders that these cars carried a much
heavier live load in proportion to their dead
weight than the cars or section-boats which
alternately floated on the canals or trundled
over the state railroads of pennsylvania

the only armored cars

  the baltimore and susquehanna achieved
the additional distinction of running the only
armored cars ever used in regular service in
america the armor consisted of a sheath-
ing of one-inch oak boards beneath the floor
to prevent passengers from being impaled on
chance  snakeheads or strap-rails that took
a notion to curl up under the weight of pass-
ing trains

  speaking of springs recalls the fact that
the original car-builders thought such refine-
ments of luxury quite superfluous herein
however they differed from the passengers
the patrons of the west chester railroad a
branch of the philadelphia and columbia
passenger-car construction



complained that the constant tremor of the
springless cars made their heads itch while
others maintained that frequent indulgence in
travel would surely- addle the brains of
travelers

innovations in springs

  air-springs were extensively used in the
early fifties these were simply cylinders
without a bottom in which a piston worked
compressing the air in the cylinder but the
air invariably leaked out leaving the spring
useless then in  some unknown
genius improved on the air-spring by sub-
stituting a diaphragm for the piston and
pouring some sugar-house molasses into the
cylinder as a seal air was then pumped into
the cylinder with a hand-pump just as bicycle-
tires were inflated at a later day and the
result gave the car a motion warranted to be
very gentle

  after the air-spring rubber was very ex-
tensively used in the fifties and sixties and
even continued in use until well along in
the eighties although its unsuitability was
recognized almost at the outset by the more
practical part of the railroad world

  so difficult was it for the people of early
days to realize that vehicles of any descrip-
tion needed or could with propriety possess
more than four wheels that four-wheeled
cars continued in use for years after winans
had shown how to build them with eight
wheels

  each road in its turn timidly experimented
with the eight-wheeled cars as with an orig-
inal discovery then for a time trains were
made up of both four-wheeled and eight-
wheeled cars but as the old four-wheelers
wore out they were replaced by the more
modern eight-wheeler until the four-wheeled
type exists nowadays only in the cabooses of
some eastern roads

close quarters for passengers

  the first passenger-cars on the west ches-
ter road were four-wheeled and had five
seats inside and one at each end outside into
each of which five passengers were supposed
to squeeze themselves one horse furnished
the motive power when the philadelphia
and columbia was opened in  it had
four-wheeled cars seating sixteen on longi-
tudinal benches like the street-car of to-day

  the saratoga and schenectady railroad
open for traffic in july  had a six-
wheeled locomotive the  saratoga which

hauled a train of eight carriages with a
total capacity of one hundred and sixty pas-
sengers and three  baggage-wagons over
the entire twenty-two miles of the line in an
hour and a half according to the saratoga
sentinel of july   the spectacle is
of a truly imposing character and will for a
long time prove a novelty of much interest to
our inhabitants

  the first passenger-cars on die allegheny
portage railroad were primitive affairs with
four wheels and seating twenty-five passen-
gers and were designed by lot dixon the
assistant engineer of the road they made
the trip of thirty-seven miles including ten
inclined planes in five hours charles dick-
ens the great english novelist who made a
trip over the road was enthusiastic over the
experience

  real luxury in travel was first provided
by the philadelphia germantown and nor-
ristown which made an eight-wheeled car by
joining two stage-coach bodies and cutting a
center-aisle to connect them if accounts are
to be credited these palaces had a barroom
at one end and a ladies saloon at the other
and were models of elegance and comfort

early railroad freaks

  one of the curiosities of those early days
was the gothic pleasure car on the erie and
kalamazoo the pioneer railroad of ohio
opened from toledo to adrian michigan
thirty-three miles in september  the
gothic car had a sort of mansard roof built
crosswise of the track there were three
compartments seating eight passengers each
two being oil the ground floor while the third
was in the attic under the mansard roof in
the center of the car the motive power at
first was supplied by one horse the fare
for the thirty-three miles was  with a
free allowance of fifty pounds of baggage
which was raised in  to 

  of all the freaks produced in the evolution
of the car however the barrel-car used on
the south carolina railroad originally the
charleston and hamburg in  deserves
the palm it was appropriately named for
it was modeled after a barrel  feet long
 feet in diameter at the middle and  feet at
the ends the staves j inches thick and 
inches wide were tongued and grooved and
held in place by six iron hoops  inches wide
and -inch thick there were twenty win-
dows on a side and a little portico lxi feet
wide at each end

louis wernwag was not the only man who


the railroad mans magazine

worried about the wheel on die outside of the
curve being obliged to travel farther than the
wheel on die inside from his time to the
present day inventors have expended a good
deal of gray matter to overcome this diffi-
culty and many and curious are the devices
they have produced for diat purpose

weak axles cause accidents

  on the little schuylkill in pennsylvania
the first cars which had stage-coach bodies
had wheels  feet in diameter and were
loose on the axle on one side so diey could
get around the curves without trouble an-
other invention consisted of one axle inside
another each carried a wheel on one end
and revolved independently of die other a
lug on one axle and a groove in the other
were supposed to keep the wheels from
spreading

  the real fault of the early axle its weak-
ness was suffered to go unheeded for a long
period with the result that more wrecks re-
sulted from broken axles than from any other
single cause president franklin pierces
only surviving child benjamin aged thirteen
was killed in a wreck caused by a broken
axle two months before his fathers inaugura-
tion mr and mrs pierce and their son
were going from andover to lawrence on the
boston and maine on january   when
their car was dashed against the rocky wall
of a cut by the breaking of an axle and little
ben who had been entertaining his parents
with his merry chatter was instantly killed
his parents escaped injury but his mother
never recovered from the shock of her boys
death

  no other accident was so much dreaded
for years as a broken axle instead however
of adopting the obvious remedy of making
the axle stronger the railroads at first only
looked for some means of averting the con-
sequences when they broke for a time a
safety beam invented by joseph s kite
superintendent of the philadelphia german-
town and norristown in  was used on
a number of roads the safety beam was
simply a beam lengthwise of the truck on
each side to hold up the broken ends of the
axles in case of failure

types that soon departed

  wheels too often failed with disastrous
consequences nothing was done about it
though until october   when the
practise of tapping the wheels with a hammer

to ascertain from the sound whether they
were cracked or not was introduced on the
new haven road

  in s a coach was built at a cost of
 for the tioga railroad that achieved
the remarkable record of forty-three years of
continuous service in which time it traveled
 miles it was exhibited at the
chicago railway exposition in  before
being honorably retired it was  feet long

	feet  inches wide and  feet  inches high

   the only ventilator was a ten-inch flue in
the center of the car the windows which
were very small could not be raised but the
panels between the windows opened the
wheels were outside the bearings light was
furnished at night by a candle at each end

  in  the editor of the anerican rail-
road journal complimented the management
of the harlem railroad on its enterprise in
providing  several superior new cars so
high that one can stand erect when he can-
not find a seat

the first compartment-car

  in  eaton  gilbert of troy built
some  saloon cars  for the hudson river
railroad which were regarded as most mag-
nificent they were a foot wider than any
coaches then in use there was an aisle at
one side opening off of which were four
saloons seating eight each and one seating
four in the larger saloons were a sofa five
chairs a center-table and a mirror land-
scapes were painted on the panels regardless
of expense

   an extra fare was charged on this the first
example of the compartment-car but one need
not have minded this extra seat-fare for the
rate then between new york and albany was
only  the hudson river railroad in
those days ran the fastest regular train in the
country making an average of thirty-six
miles an hour including stops

   the fastest long-distance run of that period
was made by the telegraph express on
june   which covered the  miles
from the chambers street station in new
york to albany in  hours and  minutes
and to buffalo  miles in  hours and
 minutes though the actual running time
was only  hours and  minutes the
schedule time from new york to chicago
then was  hours the slowest train was
run by the sangamon and morgan railroad
in illinois which consumed  hours in run-
ning  miles

while the hudson river road was indulging
passenger-car construction

in the luxury of saloon-cars the michigan
central in  built twenty-two of the
finest ordinary coaches that had been seen up
to that time they were  feet long had
six-wheeled trucks and seated seventy-two
passengers the ice-water tank made its
debut in those new cars passengers up to
that time having been served by a water-boy
who carried through the aisle a painted tin
can resembling a teakettle from which he
poured water to order three years later the
erie built some coaches that were  feet
long  feet  inches wide and  feet high
with twenty windows on a side and seated 
passengers the seats were upholstered with
plush at  a yard

illumination and heat

  the first car-stove was the invention of
dr mcwilliams of washington first used
on the baltimore and washington railroad
in  the first light was provided by
candles one at each end of the car many
attempts were made to provide a better light
but as late as  the camden and amboy
was still using candles though numerous
scars on the inner walls showed where some
patent lamp had been weighed in the balance
and found wanting

  the camden and amboy tried illuminating
gas pumped into tanks under pressure in
 while the new haven and the boston
and lowell attempted to use gas in tanks at
the ordinary pressure in the mains forced
out by a clockwork arrangement but both at-
tempts were failures other roads tried illu-
minating gas with no better success

  as for seats the first were mere planks
though imlay provided cushions for his mas-
terpieces by  some of the more enter-
prising roads had progressed to haircloth
cushions any one who has ever tried to hold
his seat on an old-fashioned broad hair-
cloth sofa safely anchored in a parlor can
imagine what a time of it the passengers of
 had in trying to stick to the narrow
angular car-seats lubricated with haircloth
while the clumsy car with poor apologies for
springs and lots of slack throughout the train
bumped and jolted over the rough track
innocent of easement curves

  if the passenger attempted to recline at ease
he would find himself on the dirty floor before
he realized that he was going or if he at-
tempted to catch himself he did so at the
imminent risk of a broken back the only
thing he could do was to brace himself with
both hands and feet and pray for deliverance

  while the haircloth car-cushion was at the
height of its ravages davenport  bridges
began building cars nine and a half feet wide
seating seventy passengers in separate arm-
chairs upholstered in red plush but nowhere
were there cars enough to handle the traffic
trains were overcrowded filthy and uncom-
fortable

  the steamboats of those days were bad
enough but they were so much better than
the cars that every one traveled by water
whenever there was any choice of routes

  the reversible-back seat made its appear-
ance in  under date of january 
 f m ray had advertised an offer of
 in prizes to inventors to promote
safety and comfort in railroad travel of
this sum  was to go to the inventor of
the best  sleeping or night seat to be ex-
hibited at the american institute fair

  perhaps the patenting of the first reclining-
chair for cars by john t hammit of phila-
delphia in the following year may have been
brought about by this prize offer it was not
called a reclining-chair however but a  night
seat in december  the editor of the
american railroad journal made a night
journey over the philadelphia wilmington
and baltimore in one of these luxurious
easy chairs he waxed very enthusiastic
over them and pronounced them  the perfec-
tion of railroad sleeping arrangements

  this would seem to indicate that the sleep-
ing-car had not then been thought of but as
a matter of fact the first sleeping-car in the
world the  chambersburg was first run on
the cumberland valley railroad between
chambersburg and harrisburg in the winter
of - and for ten years thereafter

  it was such a success that a second car
the  carlisle was immediately placed on
the opposite run

there was no bedding

  yet neither car would have come up to
modern ideas on a sleeper there were twelve
berths in three tiers but no bedding on oc-
tober   a sleeping-car was open for
public inspection in baltimore which was
put in service that night on the run to phila-
delphia a trip which required six hours

  in january  nathan thompson of
brooklyn exhibited at the st nicholas hotel
in new york a full-sized model sleeping-car
s feet long containing eight compartments

	feet long with an aisle running the length
of the car on either side the seats ran
lengthwise of the compartment back to back


the railroad mans magazine

and each was expected to accommodate four
persons attached to the sides of the car
were two seats which could be let down out
of the way when not in use

  at night the bach of the seat made one
berth and the seat made anodier a diird
was made under the seat and an extra mat-
tress could be laid on the floor for the fourth
sleeper while above the upper berth was a
rack for small children it was pointed out
that  the fastidious traveler can if he choose
take along with him a pillow or other bed-
clothing but somehow this privilege even
with the addition of die baby-rack did not
seem to appeal to the traveling public though
the proud inventor announced that he was to
provide one of his cars for die emperor of
russia

  a litde more attractive to railroad manage-
ments was the central transportation com-
pany of philadelphia g w childs being
its president this company having bought
the patents of woodruff knight and meyers
for seats and couches was able to make ar-
rangements in  to run sleeping-cars on
the pennsylvania the northern central the
bellefontaine route die central railroad of
new jersey and a few other roads but it did
not meet the requirements of the traveling
public and its career was brief

  in  the first vestibule the invention
of waterbury  atwood was introduced on
the naugatuck railroad in connecticut and
was given a years trial before die manage-
ment could decide that it would not do the
first vestibule which was not called by that
name was a flimsy affair of wood and canvas
shaped like the original narrow pullman
vestibule and was but an incidental feature
of one of the numerous plans for ventilating
trains by taking air from about the back of
the tender and conveying it through chutes to
the cars

  gradually cars were provided with more
or less comfortable seats and suitable springs
which did much to mitigate the horrors of
travel by the end of  the clearstory
began to be introduced which afforded better
means of ventilation than had been available

up to that time the wooden cars were very
frail and in collisions were almost sure to
telescope with frightful loss of life

  an attempt was made to introduce the la
mothe iron car the first metal passenger-
coach seating sixty passengers and guaran-
teed to be cheaper more durable lighter by
two tons and stronger and safer in collisions
than wooden cars but railroad men would
have none of it although a number of iron
passenger-cars were built in  at hamburg
for the russian government and the reading
railroad began using iron coal-cars as early
as 

  in fact coaches seemed to be especially
designed to facilitate telescoping for the
coupler and buffer were placed below the
car-sills so as to offer the least possible resist-
ance ezra miller a well-educated promi-
nent citizen of wisconsin undertook to rem-
edy this fault in  he obtained his first
patent for the miller platform coupler and
buffer which was hailed as the greatest
life-saving invention of the age

  the miller platform was placed on a line
with the sills where it would have the great-
est power of resistance every old-time rail-
road man will remember die  miller hook
coupler and its spring buffer for the in-
ventor lived to see it adopted by every railroad
in the united states it not only made miller
rich but by reducing the space between
platforms it enabled people to pass from car
to car in a train without risking dieir lives
and it greatly increased comfort by taking up
the slack in trains

  with the adoption of die miller platform
and coupler and with the safeguards afforded
by the westinghouse air-brake and the lux-
uries introduced under die leadership of pull-
man as already described in the railroad
mans magazine the evolution of the pas-
senger-cai was brought up to date to-day
all the big roads are considering the all-steel
car as the future passenger-coach the penn-
sylvania now uses them almost entirely as
does the new york central and the new
york new haven and hartford is putting
them in service as fast as they can be built

by s o conley

                       a story about the laws in lagunitas
                       that govern poker and pugilism

is name was anderson he
stood six feet two in his stock-
ing-feet his hair was as red
as a sunset his face was freck-
led and his hands and arms
betokened the strength that
conies of an out-of-door life big in bone
and brawn he-was easily the master of any
situation that came up for settlement in the
little camp at lagunitas

  as for lagunitas it was a mining-camp
that nestled in the foothills of calaveras
county california not being on the map
it was not dignified in the official archives
at washington d c as being worthy of the
visit of the census-taker however it had
a population of exactly -and they were
all americans born lagunitas boasted of
this fact

  one thousand of the population were of
the masculine gender and in that goodly
number anderson was the king

  he was king because he could settle any
dispute he was king because he eould have
his way in practically any old thing and he
was king because there was not a man in the
place who could land on andersons solar
plexus

  many had trained and tried but the re-



suit was always the same when the count
was given they failed to rise though he
was forty years old anderson never failed
to come back whenever he had to fight

  now it so happened that anderson never
 fell  for the fair sex many a young wom-
an of the camp had admired him for his
 shape  and his pugilistic prowess and
had let her feelings become known to him
in the coyest of coy glances but to all of
them anderson simply said beat it-not
in so many words but with the look of dis-
gust and disdain for which he was noted
and which meant more than words

  anderson had a run-in with tim logan
and all because the two men could not agree
which should deal in a very exciting poker-
game it was a game with a twenty-five-
dollar ante and no limit as to time you
could  sit in -provided you had money-
and once  in  you could play for days
perhaps

  this particular game had run for nearlv
two days and nights an agreement was
made that a recess of thirty minutes would be
taken in order that the inner man might be
replenished with a goodly supply of fried
ham sandwiches and beer when the recess
was called logan had been winning and


the railroad mans magazine

anderson losing and the other three play-
ers had whipsawed between good luck and
bad luck like so many ping-pong balls

  at length when the game was resumed
anderson went at it with a mind that was
ripe for any kind of trouble after the first
round had been dealt- and he had lost he
doubled up his fist like a janney coupler and
brought it down on the table with a bang
that sent the cards in all directions

   boys he exclaimed  im going to win
or lose something here before the night is
over take my word for it

   make a side bet with you that you lose
somethin remarked slim condon

  whats your limit asked anderson

  fiftv bones replied slim whereupon
anderson dug down into his overalls and
produced the amount

   by heck toys its all ive got he said
with some degree of surprise if i lose
this im broke and its the first time ive
been so situated in many a day

  slim produced his fifty and laid it along-
side andersons on a corner of the table
which was conveniently reserved for side
bets

  the game went on one or two hands
were dealt anderson bluffed a small jack-
pot and raked in seventeen dollars a
smile played over his face for he thought
that his luck had changed then the deal
was passed to him he ran out the cards
with the agility of long practise and when
the final one of his five had fallen in front
of him he picked them up gingerly and ran
his eye over the corners

  to his astonishment he discovered that he
had dealt himself four kings

  just for the merest phase of an instant
a lump came into his throat he was about
to cry out with joy it was only a flash
however and he regained his composure be-
fore the other four players had examined
their hands

  anderson picked up the pack and called
 cards

  one of the players chucked his hand in
the discard and passed another called for
three cards and anderson knew that he was
drawing to a pair the third hesitated a
long time and then called for one card and
so anderson naturally surmised that he want-
ed to fill out a flush then he looked at
logan and logan simply said two

   hes got three of a kind and is trying
to draw the fourth said anderson to him-
self but this time ive got him

  he picked up his own hand and scanned

the edges again he would call for one card
for himself he knew that he could not give
himself any advantage by so doing but it
might lead the other players to think that he
was drawing to a flush if he stood pat
they would surmise that he had a big hand
and perhaps stay out

   so when he said  the dealer takes one
two of the players went into the discard
this left anderson logan and a third man
in the game it was up to the third man to
open the betting

  guess its worth a ten said this indi-
vidual as he threw a shining ten-dollar piece
to the center of the table

   raise you ten said logan throwing in
a twenty

   and ten more said anderson taking
six five-dollar pieces from his pile and
placing them with the rest

  be it known in lagunitas chips were
never used for sundry and obvious reasons
it was cash on the table that was the
inevitable the unalterable rule each player
was his own banker if lie hadnt the  color 
with him then there was no need of him
sitting in- and once in a game there
was no credit when a player went broke it
was for him to quit

  andersons raise was a staggering blow to
the third man he seemed to waver between
hope and despair for a minute and then said
ill come in as if he were sorry he
placed twenty dollars on the table as if he
fully expected never to see it again

  ill raise it twenty-five said logan
throwing in the necessary cash

  and twenty-five more responded an-
deron as he counted out his fifty

  then the third man threw his into the
discard and pushed back his chair

    see you and raise you fifty said logan

   and fifty more replied anderson

  and make it another fifty continued
logan as lie counted out the coin without a
quiver

    hold on i aint got fifty said ander-
son as he dug into his pockets all of his
searching reveaed nothing the fifty that
he had put up with slim condon as a side
bet was the last money that he had save what
lay before him for the game that had now
dwindled down to the insignificant sum of
twenty-two dollars

  this is my limit said anderson count-
ing out the twenty-two unless i can with-
draw that side bet with slim

  slim who had simply been observing and
saying nothing looked at anderson for a
andersons four kings

     



moment and then said i prefer to let it
go as it lays

  let me draw down twenty-five of it
suggested anderson

  slim didnt move a muscle let it go as
it lays he repeated

  ill bet you your limit-in cash-and
then- said logan reaching into the pot
and counting himself out twenty-eight dollars

    what do you mean by  in cash    asked
anderson

   i mean that as we are the only two in
the game ill bet you any tiling aside from
cash that you want to put up

  that goes replied anderson tightly
gripping the four kings in his janney fists
ill bet you my three roan mares

   against my chestnut stallion  theyre
worth it said logan

   good here buck and anderson
called to a young miner who was intently
watching the game you keep these bets on
paper well lose track of them

   buck sat in as recording secretary

    ill put up forty head of my two-vear-old
steers anderson went on  can you meet
that

  ill put up forty head of mine against
them as a raise replied logan

  the betting between the two continued
until the pot contained besides the several
hundred dollars six hundred head of cattle
fourteen saddles several hundred head of
sheep twenty acres of land four heavy farm
wagons the three mares the chestnut stal-
lion two gallons of red liquor and six
revolvers

  buck had recorded each bet carefully
several onlookers had gone about spreading
the news and soon the little room back of
caseys where the exciting contest was being
waged was thronged with miners

  the two players sat opposite each other
each had seen the others bet with a grim
determination neither had faltered but
now anderson had bet everything that he
possessed except his ranch-a matter of some
thousand acres or so nestling in the laguni-
tas foothills

  he had undying faith in his four kings
he honestly believed that they were not to be
topped in this particular game logan had
a big hand or was only bluffing his four
kings were as safe and sure as the eternal
hills

  however he didnt want to put up the
ranch or any part of it unless logan would
agree to put up the equivalent in something
besides land anderson had all the land he

   	r r

wanted it was no object to him to add any
more acres to his possessions and further-
more there were great unclaimed ranges not
fifty miles away where he could graze his
steers at will and fifty miles is only an easy
jaunt in the vast western region that claimed
lagunitas as its center

  tell you what ill do said anderson
looking at his four kings to see if a fifth had
not silently slipped in while the betting was
going on- tell you what ill do ill put up
my ranch against anything youve got except
land

    cept land   echoed logan

   ive got all the land i want replied
anderson

   you must think youre going to win
said logan

  i wouldnt bet this way if i wasnt sure
of it there was meaning in andersons
face as he spoke you dont want to call
me do you

  if i did i would say so logan also
spoke to show that there was no fooling so
far as he was concerned

  well what have you besides land
queried anderson

  logan got up from his seat and stretched
himself

  let me see he said somewhat uncer-
tain  ive got about everything in the pot
now except my land and-and-

  and what interjected anderson

   four hundred dollars in the lagunitas
bank answered logan reaching into the
pocket of his shirt and producing a faded
bank-book

  my ranch is worth fourteen thousand
said anderson

    do you want to bet it all   asked logan

  all no part of it what can you put
up to represent the other ten thousand  

   i dont know said logan cautiously

    i do replied anderson with his custom-
ary bruskness

  logan looked at him for reply the spec-
tators stood widemouthed and awestricken
not one dared to breathe a sound

  anderson looked steadily at logan there
was not a quiver in the big mans face he
arose and stood just across the table from his
opponent one hand clutching the four kings
the other resting idly on his waist

  logan was mustering all that he possessed
in a mental inventory what in the name of
all that is could anderson mean  what had
he overlooked what did he possess of tan-
gible quality of which anderson was aware
and he was in the dark


the railroad mans magazine

  what do you refer to he finally asked
anderson

  there wasnt a man in die room who wasnt
just as anxious to hear as logan

  lucy ames said anderson

  every eye was turned on logan

  the woman-hater of lagunitas the only
man in camp who had withstood the wiles
and guiles and snares and sentimentalities
of the fair sex had asked tim logan to
actually make the woman he loved and had
asked to be his wife part of the stakes in a
poker game

  lucy ames logan spoke her name
and then began to gather his senses  why
-why-she is engaged to me

  you heard me tim i aint here to
argue your matrimonial affairs im playing
poker

   i cant do it anderson youre asking
too much

   im playing poker was all that the big
man would say

   why dont you call me if youve reached
your limit asked logan

  ive got my ranch youve got the girl
and four hundred dollars i want the girl

   well you cant get her in a poker game 
logan slammed the table as if he meant it

   all right went on anderson  ill
withdraw my property and you withdraw
your bank-book ill call you-and then we
fight for the girl

  logan wanted time to consider this propo-
sition-and he took it he walked back
and forth a few steps he was turning it
over in his mind he was one of the few
men in the camp who had not gone up against
the fists of anderson and largely because he
was a peace-loving creature fear however
had no place in his heart and though he
lacked four of andersons inches in height
and twenty of his pounds in weight he would
 give him a go and lucy should be the
stakes

  he stopped looked anderson squarely in
the face and said

   youre on 

  the crowd gasped and shuddered one
or two muttered something if there was any
excitement it was not centered in the two
players both were as cool and collected and
game as true westerners must be

  anderson suddenly broke the buzz and
hum with

   i call you what have you got 

  four aces said logan

  andersons mighty frame shook and the
color came to his face as he glimpsed the

four winning spots and a ten of diamonds
which logan spread out before him

    its yours he said

  he sat down and pushed the four kings
into the discard

   two or three of the spectators ventured to
ask anderson what he held and logan too
would have given part of the pot to have
known but anderson said not a word he
simply took the discard and shuffled it idly
for a moment then threw it into the middle
of the table logans hand was thrown on
top and the pack completed the two men
sat down -and the deeds of conveyance from
anderson to logan were quickly made for
it didnt take long to transfer property in
lagunitas

  the poker game was ended

  the preparations for the fight were made
with the customary precision that attended
such events when two contestants had de-
cided on a mill it didnt require a year on the
vaudeville circuits followed by six months
training with newspaper interviews ex-prize-
fighters for trainers and the other accessories
that adorn a professional battle

  nearly every lagunitas lad who could
scrap was in trim at all hours of the day or
night and it so happened that anderson
with his record for pugilistic supremacy was
ready then and there

   logan on the other hand asked for a day
the long siege in the poker game-three days
without much food and no sleep-had not
left him in a fit condition to tackle the big-
gest punch-artist in the camp added to
this the stakes were his girl-his own best
girl-and he wanted some show

   ill meet you to-morrow at dick stan-
leys ill be there at ten oclock in the
morning-sharp said logan

  id rather pull it off now answered
anderson  i want to get through with this
matter

  but logan insisted he wasnt in condi-
tion it was unfair for anderson to be so
headstrong finally anderson realized that
the other mans objections were based on
what was right and he consented

  dick stanleys was just a plain ordinary
frontier saloon where the most prominent
happenings of lagunitas were usually dis-
cussed back of it was a long level field of
some twenty acres surrounded by shady oaks
in its center there had been erected a twentv-
four-foot elevation of plain pine boards ap-
propriately roped in and on this historic
platform some of the greatest fistic encounters
of the town had taken place
andersons four kings



  the news of the anderson-logan bout
spread with the rapidity of a frontier flame
before it was fifteen minutes old the news
had begun to spread in an hour most every
man and woman in lagunitas knew it by
night and die next morning it had reached
the near-by camps in consequence the crowd
began to gather early the next morning and
long before the appointed hour some twenty
acres of humanity-men women and chil-
dren-were jostling one another for vantage
spots on the sward

  logan slept that night as never he slept
before he resolved that the meeting with
the champion was not going to bother him
though anderson had vanquished even-- man
who had stood before him perhaps in the
parlance recently produced at reno he
couldnt come back at any rate it wasnt
logans style to lose his head or worry he
would stand before the giant and take his
medicine like the man he was and if he lost
he would say good-by to lucy and wish her
well

  as for lucy she had nothing to say in
the matter it had long been the lagunitas
method to fight for a woman and it was the
pride of the lagunitas women to be pointed
out in their society as the chosen one of a
pugilistic victor

  lucy took it philosophically she had no
doubt that anderson would land a wallop on
logans jaw that would drop the smaller
man and with this in mind she was pre-
pared to accept the inevitable

  for the moment she was the center of
attraction many from the neighboring camps
who had never set eyes on her came around
to the little house where she passed her hum-
drum life with her parents just to take a
peek as they expressed it born eighteen
years before in kentucky she had been
brought to the camp with the rush of gold-
seekers she was a comely girl with the
blackest of raven locks and a wonderful
smile and the most bewitching black eyes
for miles around she was the belle

  that is why anderson who had shunned
all women wanted to claim her for his own

  to do anderson justice he slept too both
men were awake early and both walked down
to the cool fast-flowing creek about a mile
from town and cavorted in its invigorating
water till the blood tingled and the appetite
was put on ravor-edge then each went to
his home ready for the frying bacon and
eggs and the steaming coffee which never
taste so good as on the plains

  when the respective breakfasts of the con-

testants had been put away it lacked just one
hour of ten oclock just what filled out this
space of time is unnecessary here save that
logan smoked his pipe and counted over his
newly-acquired richesand anderson chewed
on a mouthful of plug tobacco and wondered
how he was going to start all over again to
regain new wealth

  both men entered the ring promptly on
the moment there was no array of train-
ers and ring-attendants there-were no fancy
trunks and highly-colored bath-robes there
were no buckets of water no sponges no bell
to toll off the seconds when one or the other
went to the floor there was no referee to keep
the men within the rules and count off the
fatal ten when one of them struck the floor
and-there were no gloves

  no rules governed boxing-bouts in la-
gunitas it was simply a case of fight and
fight fair-but fight foul tactics only ren-
dered publicly unpopular the man who in-
dulged in them he was liable to be treated
with the contumely that would make life a
burden

  anderson was the first to climb the paling
that separated the ring from the crowd he
threw off his coat and hat and stood with
bared and brawny arms while the crowd
cheered in a second later logan was also
inside the ropes hatless and coatless the
sleeves of his blue shirt rolled up to his arm-
pits in another second both men had ad-
vanced to the ring and were squaring off

  anderson looked more than a match for
his rival big he was and the strength in
him showed in every movement of his body
bets quickly ran through the crowd the
odds were ten fifteen even twenty to one
that anderson would win but there were
those who did not hesitate at the short end

  anderson feinted with his right and lo-
gan drew back then logan came to the
front with a strong right swiijg which an-
derson ducked and the smaller man fanned
the air in such a manner that it seemed as if
he had lost his wind anderson quick as a
cat sent a short left to logans head and
logan caught it full on the jaw and stag-
gered the men holding the long-end
bets began saying  i told you so

  logan circled around anderson with a neat
and agile step the blow in the jaw had
been felt and he was a trifle dizzy and
didnt want to mix it up again until he felt
a little better anderson was trying to force
the fighting that was plain for once or twice
he rushed at his opponent but logan was
too spry


the railroad mans magazine

   land on his right andy   go in and
slug andy hes got no show andy
were some of the encouraging sentiments
hurled at the champion-but there were no
cheers for logan

   anderson sparred cleverly until he had his
man in a corner and then he aimed to plant
a right which would have ended the sport
then and there-had it landed but logan
anticipated it and ducked and as he ducked
his right shot up with stupendous force and
landed square on the unprotected proboscis of
mr anderson the champion reeled back
and the faces of the crowd turned pale as a
small trickle of blood seamed his face

  anderson gritted his teeth for he was
mad he came at logan with a terrific rush
and a well-aimed right but logan was only
too keen and again he ducked and both men
clinched

  at short range logan managed to land a
few telling body-blows-and to receive a few
-and as anderson did not care for this style
of give-and-take fighting he fairly hurled
logan from him and he struck against the
ropes logan now knew that his best scheme
was to wear his man out so long as he
could do so he might have a chance

  so whenever anderson rushed logan took
the opposite tactics and there came a point
when the champion started to end it all

  ive got you now tim he said as he
stepped back several paces and raised his
janney fists

  come on answered tim and ander-
son came he raised both clenched fists in
the air and brought them down with the force
of a pile-driver but again the little man
swerved out of the way the force of the
blow weakened the man who delivered it
his intent was to strike logan on the head
and end it and now he was out of breath

  logan rose to his full height and while
the champion was wondering what had hap-
pened he received a rain of sharp well-
directed blows on his face that sent him stag-
gering before he could come back logan
sent in two to his stomach and anderson
doubled up and went to his knees

  when he regained his feet he made an-
other desperate lunge at logan and one
staggering blow met the little mans jaw but

logan had him going and he knew it
again and again he played on andersons
wind and again and again anderson landed
on him the crowd marveled that he could
stand such punishment at length logan
saw an opening one faultless swing went
straight to the champions eye and closed it
another caught him where he feared it most
-in the wind anderson swung power-
fully but futilely and then a swift one from 
logan caught his solar plexus so neatly that
he reeled over and went down on his back

  the mighty anderson was vanquished he
had failed to  come back he lay pros-
trate for a few minutes but according to
the code of lagunitas those few minutes were
sufficient to count him out

  the crowd had begun to disperse and a
new luminary had appeared in the person of
tim logan the  short-enders  were cash-
ing in their bets

  logan still calm still the same cool col-
lected individual reached for his hat and
coat put them on and then assisted the fallen
idol to his feet he held out his hand
which anderson took and shook with hearty
feeling for out there in lagunitas no man
could harbor a grudge even after defeat

  in the general excitement that followed a
dark-haired dark-eyed kentucky girl made
her way through the crowd and beamed the
most wonderful smile on tim logan as he
stepped down from the ring tim beamed in
return

   i wanted you to win tim she said

 all night i prayed for you

  then she put her arms around her hero
and kissed him and tim drew her close to
him and kissed her

  i went in to win just as i went in to
win you the first time i ever set eyes on you
he replied

  late that afternoon just as the last rays
of the sun were slipping over the mountains
a solitary horseman might have been seen
riding down the lone dusty road that stretched
from lagunitas to the west he wore a sad
dejected look-like some mighty conqueror
who had fallen after fighting the fight that
would have made him a hero of the ages

  it was the mighty anderson making for
pastures new

tt ork on a construction-train that is constantly pushing ahead over a new
w uneven road-bed is apt to carry with it some rough-and-ready experi-
ences that differ somewhat from the every - day run of railroad routine
found in an old-established division

    contractor mallory concerning whose exploits a number of yarns have been
spun seems to have a faculty of bobbing up wherever any rough-house was about
to start or a prank was being played two hoboes also figure in sgme rough-and-
tumble tales that start the laugh-valve going and help to pass the idle moments
spent waiting for the cry of the call-boy

    and mr seaver knows how to tell these tales

startling and amusing situations that developed from a tendency among
frontier railroad men to keep things in the con-
struction-camp constantly on the move

leventeexs off again

 whats the matter now  

     tommie maddern is pulling
  her with the deuce of course
  the deuce had to break a back
  spring-hanger on her rear drivers
  and lift her trucks off the track
   she is getting to be as bad as though
  she was no  instead of the deuce

   we had an engine on the denver mem-
phis and atlantic with the same number  
and everybody spoke of her as the deuce
and the three-spot as the tray this den-
ver engine was well-named the deuce for if
there was any tricks calculated to make an
engineer or fireman swear that she didnt
know i never heard of them

  mason who came to us from the k p
was about as good a runner as ever sat on
the right side he was a little reckless it
is true and if he got behind time which
often happened he would turn em for all
that was out

  the road had just been completed from
winfield to belle plain and had not been
fully surfaced mason got an order to take
the deuce and pull a special consisting of

  the private car of vice-president mallory
and the private car of chief engineer
thayer of the fitzgerald and mallory con-
struction company from winfield to belle
plain in sumner county

  the commissioners of cowley county
had been invited as the trip was intended
to be one of inspection if the commission-
ers were satisfied with the road the bonds
on that portion of the line between winfield
and the sumner county line which was just
east of oxford would be delivered to the
contractors at this place the road crossed
the arkansas river and the bridge was a
pile concern only a temporary structure as
the iron bridge was to go in later

  now as every railroad man in kansas
knows the arkansas is a treacherous stream
there was no bottom and the piles were
simply stuck in the sand as a result all
trains had to crawl across the road from
winfield to oxford was full of low joints
and high centers and taken all around was
about as tough a piece of track as could be
found anywhere how those commissioners
ever accepted the road in that shape i never
could understand

the railroad mans magazine

   mason had crawled over the new road
carefully and at oxford got a clearance for
belle plain this part of the track had
been well surfaced and was in good condi-
tion for a new road-bed he pulled out of
oxford and told one of the officers of the
railroad company who was riding on the
engine that he was going to shake the hay-
seeds up a bit

   billy got her down in the corner and
opened her up and away he went mallory

 mallory was nervous so he pulled
the bell-cord

was a nervous kind of a duck and did not
care for fast riding so he pulled the bell-
cord mason had unhooked the cord from
the gong and knew that he was being sig-
naled to stop

  by some mistake a material-train load-
ed with iron for the new bridge at oxford
had been let out of the belle plain yard
and met the special about half-way at this
point there was a bank on the left side and

  the arkansas river was on the right the
road being laid along the west bank of the
river

  there was a stretch of straight track at
this point and one engineman saw the other
about the same time the tray and the deuce
were sister engines both eight-wheelers and
nearly alike in weights and everything else
norris had charge of the tray and was pull-
ing the material-train

   both men sounded their whistles plugged
  their engines and went overboard
  mason went out through the right
  gangway and the railroad official
  was close behind him while the
  fireman went overboard through the
  left gangway mason and the rail-
  road officer struck the edge of the
  fill both alighting on their feet
  but the new - made ground was
  treacherous and gave way and the
  two rolled down the bank and
  plumped into the river the fire-
  man landed on his head in a sand-
  bank

    norris and his fireman went
  off on the left side of their engine
  -which was the river side-struck
  the edge of the bank and tobog-
  ganed down into the water old
  man mallory went out of his car
  over the rear platform and landed
  on the ties in the middle of the
  track in a sitting posture with a
  dull thud which shook all sumner
  county and caused the inhabitants
  to imagine that a shock of earth-
  quake had occurred

    thayer was in his car in the
act of taking a drink of brandy
when the two engines came together he sat
down on the carpet and poured his brandy
out on it the county commissioners were
thrown out of their chairs but were not hurt

 the deuce reared up and tried to climb
over the tray which had also reared both
engines were locked so close that they could
not be pulled apart but aside from smash-
ing the pilots and headlights knocking off
the stacks and battering the front ends
neither engine was seriously damaged both
cylinder saddles standing the shock without
fracture

  when the engineman and the railroad
official crawled out of the water and got back
to the road they were met by mallory and
the remarks that he made were inclined to
be scandalous and not at all suited for a
class of sundav-school scholars
told in the roundhouse



  mason and norris did not pay any at-
tention to the old man they knew his
ways and simply went about examining
their engines to see the amount of damage
that had been done the deuce and tray
were sent to the fort scott and wichita
shops two engines were borrowed from this
road and mason and norris sent out on
them

   every man connected with the road at
belle plain from section-hand to train-des-
patcher was called up on the carpet by mal-
lory but that was all that it amounted to
after that mallory sent thayer who was
his son-in-law out with all specials on in-
spection of new track and when it became
necessary for him to go over the road lie
did his inspection from the tail end of a ma-
terial or construction train possibly he
thought that his daughter could better afford
to be a widow than he could take chances
on leaving her fatherless

  mallory lived at chariton iowa and
was one of the best-known railway contract-
ors in the west so that it was rare that a
time came when he was not handling a
heavy railroad contract somewhere in the
trans-mississippi country

   he had a force of men in the various
departments that he took with him from con-
tract to contract these men were always
putting up some job on the old man yet
there was not one of them but would have
gone through fire and water to serve him

   one day mallory was out on the work
and had the train stop on the grouse creek
bridge while he went ahead to examine it
mason was there with the deuce and when
the train stopped he lit his pipe and pro-
ceeded to take things easy

  will s cartter of st louis had the
contract for the bridges and he and mal-
lory went out on the bridge cartter stands
six feet in his stockings and is bald as a
billiard-ball the two men stopped on the
center of the bridge and cartter was point-
ing at something mallory was a short man
and standing beside cartter he put one in
mind of sydney smiths remarks about the
mile and the milestone

   when mason saw those two fellows there
the deuce got into him and whistling
 brakes off he rang the bell pulled the
throttle and started toward them mallory
yelled at him and thejfturned and sprinted
for the other end of the bridge cartter was
right behind him and lost his hat at the
first jump his bald head glistening in the
sunlight

   cartter had the advantage of mallory in
the length of legs but mallorys little toot-
sies twinkled in and out with twice the speed
that cartter could get up as they hit the ties
mallory got to the end of the bridge and
did not stop to see where he was going but
tumbled down the bank mason swore that
cartters first step took him down to the
berm and the second clean across the bor-
row-pit while mallory got stuck in the mud

  long before they reached the end of the
bridge mason had stopped and he with the
fireman and conductor were fairly doubled
up in a paroxysm of laughter mallory
made remarks about fool enginemen and the
more he articulated the harder the gang
roared then to add insult to injury cart-
ter when safe beyond the borrow-pit joined
in laughing at mallory

   if the road had not been shy of engine-
men mallory would certainly have given
mason a lay-off but they were behind time
with their work and the time was getting
short for the completion of that section so
no more was heard of it

  when the eastern division of the d m
and a from coffeyville to belle plain was
completed the two ends came together a few
miles east of tisdale in cowley county
and on the summit of the divide about half-
way between tisdale and dexter there had
been an elaborate program arranged for the
ceremony of driving the last spike and on
the day appointed a special train pulled out
from winfield having the county and city
officials reporters and other dignitaries
aboard

   upon reaching the spot which was in a
shallow cut the winfield party were met by
a special train from the east and a large
crowd from dexter tisdale burden and
the surrounding country had assembled at
the spot

   the usual speeches were made and the
regulation number of bouquets were thrown
at the railroad officials construction com-
pany and others interested in the enterprise
and then came the ceremony of driving the
last spike  bill  hackney a bright lawyer
a leading politician and at that time the
mayor of winfield and mallory took their
positions mallory taking the spike outside
the rail and hackney the one inside

  when those two men took hold of the
spike-mauls it was a sight for gods and
men mallory took hold of his maul as
though he wished he were anywhere else at the
time and hackney handled his instrument
as though he was afraid it would explode

ctytyr

 both rolled into
 the river

the boss track-layer started the two spikes
into the tie with a few taps and then mal-
lory and hackney set to work swinging
their mauls alternately

  the first stroke mallory landed on the
head of his spike but hackney swung wide
and struck the ball of the rail as though he
was endeavoring to break it in two by a blow
from the sledge at the second stroke mal-
lory missed the spike altogether and hit the
tie with such force that he almost lost his
balance

   ben clover of burden a farmer and
leading democratic politician who had been
the most determined opponent the d m
and a had in the county was standing near
hackney when he swung for his second
blow at the spike his foot slipped and he
spun around catching ben fair on the shin
and causing him to crumple up like a paw-
paw leaf in frost-time

  ben swore that hackney had deliberate-
ly fouled him and it was no more than he
could expect from a republican politician

hackney apologized and again
swung for the spike this time
hitting it mallory who had
been leaning on his sledge wait-
ing for hackneys stroke again
swung for the spike this time
hitting it a glancing blow and
knocking it clean out of the tie

 the crowd hooted and yelled
while the boss track-layer was
setting another spike and this
time mallory swung viciously
hitting the spike with the first
square blow since he had es-
sayed to drive it hackney
came with another swing and
this time he also hit his spike
fe two or three more blows
which happened to land fair-
 x ly sent the spikes about half-
way home and mallory and
hackney then stepped back
and the boss track-
layer and another
took their places
and with one blow
each sent the
spikes home to the
head

       i would have
given anything for
a snap-shot
of those fellows
hackney and mal-
lory especially if i
could have caught the expression upon the
faces of the track-gang if a man ever
showed that he was thoroughly disgusted
with his boss it was that boss track-layer as
he watched mallorys attempts to drive those
spikes home

    ben clover was sent to the legislature a
few years afterward from that district on
the populist ticket defeating hackney and
the republicans who had held sway ever
since the county was organized but ben al-
ways swore that bill hackney had inten-
tionally swung that sledge a glancing blow
with the fell purpose of getting even with a
political opponent

    after the spikes were driven the engines
blew their whistles and rang the bells and
made all the racket they could while the
crowd cheered tgn there were some more
speeches and the wiin from winfield pro-
ceeded to back down to that point followed
by the special from coffeyville bringing all
the people who cared to climb aboard

    the trains pulled into winfield with
told in the roundhouse



bells ringing whistles blowing and cannon
firing there were more speeches more bou-
quets but nothing to eat the crowd had
to rustle its own grub

    the road was formally opened for traf-
fic from coffeyville to belle plain the next
day but it is said that from that day up to
the day of his death nothing could induce
mallory to drive the last spike on any of the
work he had under contract

     what made them so awkward   asked
jimmie

     did you ever attempt to drive a rail-
road spike if not try it the first chance
you get in appearance nothing is easier
than the way in which spikers drive but it
is a special blow only acquired by long
practise it is a safe bet that if mallory
and hackney had either of them ever before
tackled the job of driving a railroad spike
into a tie alongside the rail they would have
left the honor to some one who was more
expert 

    pat ogrady was the boss track-layer on
the east end and he had been with mallory
a long time in fact since mallory took up
railroad contracting after the war now
pat was a devout believer in the virtues of
the soil of the emerald isle and though by

his own confession his parents left ireland
when he was hardly two years old his im-
pressions were vivid

  now at that time the country from
winfield in cowley county east to caney
in montgomery county was a comparatively
new section of kansas and settlers were com-
ing in on the osage diminished reserve in
large numbers still the greater portion of
the country was virgin prairie and the blue
stem as the prairie grass was termed fairly
teemed with rattlesnakes of all sizes kinds
and conditions from the little prairie rattler
to the diamond-back

   so numerous were they that it became a
sort of religion with the settlers and even
with people who had occasion to travel on
horseback or in buggies across the prairies
to immediately stop their horses or vehicles
when they heard a rattler sing and when
they had located him whip him with the
buggy whip until he was unable to coil and
as a rattler can only strike when coiled it
was then easy to put the heel upon its head
and end its career

   during all the time of the construction
of the road it was in vain that the boys
endeavored to get pat reconciled to the pres-
ence of the rattlers there was no danger

causing him to crumple up like a paw-paw leaf in frost-time


the railroad mans magazine

that they would get up on the new road-bed
and pat religiously heeded the admonition

	keep off the grass

   one day mallory came along over the
work in a buggy he had killed several
rattlers and had their rattles with him

  mallory like all other irishmen would
willingly go without a meal if he could get
a joke on the other fellow he called pat
over to the buggy and told him that he did
not like the hat-band he was wearing and
had brought him another while mallory
was getting it out pat was profuse in his
thanks and he was too busy to notice what it
was that mallory was putting around his hat

  mallory handed him his dicer and he
put it on but in doing so his hand hap-
pened to touch something cold and clammy
pat jerked the hat from his head and
caught just a glimpse of a rattler coiled
around the brim howling blue murder pat
dropped the hat and in his excitement
stumbled down the bank into the borrow-
pit and the hat landed beside him

howling blue murder pat dropped the hat

  pat came pretty near throwing afit right
there and mallory began to be alarmed lest
his joke was destined to have results that he
had not anticipated he jumped out of the
buggy and clambered down the fill until he
secured pats head-dress

   pats eyes stood out like door-knobs
when he saw mallory take off the snake
he could not be convinced that it was only
an empty skin

  but mallory was not yet through with
pat

    ogrady said he  a friend brought
me a cigar-box full of the soil from old
killarney i have brought it out for you
to see

   saying this mallory hauled out a cigar-
box from under the seat which he handed to-
pat

    sure now and its happy i am that i
lived to see the soil of old ireland an
what would yez be afther doin wid it sor 
he asked

    why pat i brought this out for you
you know that the touch of irish soil
is certain death to snakes and all other
vermin and you need have no fear of
snakes so long as you keep this box of
earth where they must run against it
pat took the box with extravagant
expressions of joy he was the envied
of the envied among the rest he guard-
ed that box with the greatest of care and
none of the men in charge of the work
could find it in their hearts to tell him
that it was nothing more than a box of
grouse creek earth that mallory had
scraped up at dexter

  the work was being pushed for the
permanent bridge over grouse creek
though a structure of piles and false
work was already in to carry the track
over the stream a blast had been put
in on the west bank where they were
sinking foundation-pits for the abut-
ment and as it tore out the limestone
it opened up a nest of rattlers of all
sizes ages shapes and conditions the
wrigglers shot out in every direction and
there was some lively work for a time
every man trying to kill as many snakes
as he could

   one of the boys lifted pats precious
box of irish soil from the car and set it
upon the ground where the snakes must
crawl over it pat shouted

    now ye omadhauns come on and
see what the soil trod by the blessed st
patrick will do to you
told in the roundhouse



   the snakes came on and
crawled over and around the box
with no resulting harm one of
them even coiled on top of it

    sure now says pat  the
divil must be in the box

  when the battle was over and
no more snakes could be found
work was resumed but when pat
went to camp that night he left the
box behind him

  some of the men reminded him
of it and he replied that while the
soil of ireland was doubtless sure
death to any reptile that might
chance upon the emerald isle he
was fully convinced that it lost its
potency when carried across the sea

   there were always more or less
hoboes around the construction-
camps but they were made to work
or get out if a man said he was	r

tramping on the search for work	

they would put him on the job in	i

some capacity	-

pat had little mercy on the	

man who would not work when it	r i

was offered him and if occasional-	 -

ly happened that a hobo would try

to slip away after pat had given	 t h-

him a job but it was rare that he	jljlls

succeeded it soon got so that the
professional hobo kept away from

thing about illinois prairie mud you know
that it is black and decidedly sticky and this
is especially the case along the mississippi
bottoms there is only one kind of mud
that sticks worse to my knowledge and that
is the black waxy mud of texas

   the tramp managed to get the mud out
of his mouth and when the boys saw that
he was not hurt they gave me the  go
ahead  sign and as we pulled out the tor-
rent of profanity that followed us was sim-
ply scandalous if his curses could have
come home to us we would certainly have
been marked men for the rest of our lives
for if there was any ill luck that he did not
wish that train-crew both here and in the
hereafter none of us had ever heard of it

   ben hodges used to tell of an experience
he had on the gulf colorado and santa fe
the only portion of the story that the boys
were skeptical about was that a tramp would
take a bath

   he was clipping along with a south-
bound freight a little behind time as he
came to the brazos crossing he saw a red
flag on the side of the bank just beyond the
bridge at this point the road after cross-
ing the bridge curved to the west around
the nose of a hill

  just as he dropped over the hill leading
down to the brazos bridge he had a break-
in-two the break occurring three or four
cars ahead of the caboose ben squealed for
brakes and pulled her open the brakemen
could only hope to keep the runaway under
control so down the hill they went ben giv-
ing her another notch to keep away from the
breakaway

  just as he reached the bottom of the hill
and took her by the neck to cross the bridge
lie saw a red flag on the edge of the bank
and just beyond the bridge this meant that

the section-gang had a rail out beyond to
stop meant a tail-end smash to go ahead
meant to pile in the ditch so he decided as
it was six of one and half a dozen of the
other he would let her go

   he got down and stood behind his fire-
man in the left gangway ready to jump
when they came up to the flag and saw that
it was a red-flannel shirt while down in the
stream a tramp was splashing in the red
flood as though he enjoyed cavorting in the
tawny fluid you know that the water of
the brazos at nearly all times is red as also
the waters of some other streams in texas
especially the colorado and the red rivers

   the break-in-two stopped on the bridge
and ben shut her off and then backed up to
hook on to the tail end the train-crew
compelled the tramp to come ashore and they
wanted to know why in the blue blazes if
he wished to take a bath he could not have
hung his red shirt somewhere else

   the tramp explained that the day was
so warm that he thought it was a good time
to take a bath and at the same time cleanse
his soiled shirt and that he hung it on that
bush because it got the full benefit of the
breeze sweeping across the river and the full
glare of the sun and protested that he did
not think it was in the position that would
make it resemble a section-gangs flag

   the fellow was so honest about it that
the boys forgot their anger and that he had
not got beyond the saving effects of a bath
demonstrated that he was not utterly hope-
less sc it ended by their taking him aboard
the train and carrying him on to temple
they got him a job as wiper in the round-
house and the last that ben heard of him
he was still on the road

  here conies seventeen so-leng boys
and the roundhouse assembly adjourned

railroads versus automobiles

not a little has been said and written of late
about the various effects of the automobile
demand in connection with the diversion to pur-
chases of cars of funds which otherwise might be
added to the capital held in savings-banks and
similar institutions or devoted to the purchase of
securities of the income-yielding class

  it is now reported that certain railway officials
are disposed to regard the automobile as having
an adverse effect on passenger traffic

  xo figures are adduced to show to what extent
the motor deprives the railway of business and on
the other hand there are railroad men who arc
quoted as saying that the companies derive positive
benefit from the multiplication of autos apart

from the freight earnings which are the result of
transportation of the raw material and the product
when finished

  furthermore it is held that business is actually
brought to the railroads particularly through the
increased employment of auto-trucks which haul
four times the tonnage that can be carried by
wagons with horses and in from one-half to one-
third the time which the latter require to bring
goods to the freight stations for shipment

  the disposition of the farming population
throughout the country to use autos in transport-
ing their products renders them able to ship the
same with much more independence while it also
stimulates the demand for better roads-braelstreets
worries of a sleeping-car con

by samuel p flint

there are few phases of railroading where diplomacy tact and ability to
read between the lines of the rule-book play so important a part as in the
daily routine of the sleeping-car conductor like the skipper on the high
seas he is the sole arbiter of all the troubles of the passengers his judgment
must be excellent and his wit quick or he is sometimes apt to find himself in a
most undesirable position

     above all things the pullman company and railroads operating their own
sleepers desire that their patrons should not leave a train dissatisfied with the
treatment accorded them and a popular sleeping-car conductor often proves so
valuable an asset that it is difficult to reckon his full value in dollars and cents

trying to calm the kickers and keep every passenger satisfied requires
the wisdom of a solomon combined with the patience of job
and the courage of a wall street magnate

  take responsibility upon yourself what we
  want is to encourage people to ride on
  sleepers

     every con knows it

     obviously a sleeping-car is close quarters
  for everybody the luxury of american
  travel has resulted in much being expected of
  it the handsome fittings the completeness
  of the equipment make it essential that

e pullman company has a
book of rules for the guidance
of sleeping-car conductors but
practically every rule may be
broken and the conductor com-
mended if he has used good
judgment in breaking them

  the sleeping-car conductor is a czar so to
speak and he can direct at will when occa-
sion demands above his book of rules comes
this unwritten law

   make your passengers comfortable and
happy whatever comes up be a diplomat
avoid friction scent out trouble and dis-
turbance before it starts dont be afraid to


the railroad mans magazine

points some fussily demanding attention far
over their share

  the sleeping-car conductor must harmonize
all anything but dissatisfaction a perfect
trip for even- one is what an instructor
tries to pound into each man and some fine
day when a new conductor called into the
division superintendents office concerning a
complaint pulls proudly out his book of rules
and justifies himself completely by rule 
he is taken down a peg by being told that the
company would rather lose unnumbered dol-
lars than have had that complaint come in
that he should think of the companys busi-
ness and pleasing its patrons before all

  some men never thoroughly learn this
lesson and never become good sleeping-car
conductors other men very frequently have
their reports at the end of their runs filled
with explanations these are the men of
whom such things as these are said

    jennie we had the loveliest sleeping-car
conductor coming on from duluth

  mighty fine conductor on our train last
night took a lot of interest was compan-
ionable and made everybody feel at home
you felt that man was running those cars
you knew he was about with an eye on
everything

  such men are delivering the goods for
which the traveling public is paying they
are worth almost their weight in gold for a
popular sleeping-car conductor is a far more
valuable asset than he is ever apt to realize

  day in and day out it needs very nearly
the wisdom of solomon the patience of job
the courage of a wall street magnate to pre-
vent anything unpleasant from arising it is
not the part of a sleeping-car conductor to
wait for anything to happen he must antici-
pate complaints and if the impending trouble
comes through any of his passengers he must
smooth it out diplomatically

he woke the wrong snorer

  on a sleeper whirling through the middle
west about three oclock one morning a
watchful conductor passing along the aisle
heard a rasping snorting noise rising above
the roar of the train it was the kind of
noise that is bound to waken somebody it
was a snore from a section at the end of the
car

   now it is a risky thing to disturb snoring
people they are apt to take offense but
this conductor had a manner that had disen-
tangled many difficulties and he felt sure
he could cope with the situation anyhow

if that snoring kept on half his car would
be aroused inside of five minutes

  he walked softly to the snore now very
loud and annoying-and then lie remembered
he stopped short in that berth was a pretty
girl no it couldnt be possible just at that
instant the snore grew louder yes he must
stop it

  as quietly as he could he awoke the
snoring beauty she was indignant she
protested with tact he pacified her but-
what the girl was awake and talking to
him and yet snores were still coming from
the berth

   oh i might as well confess she said
tartly after a glance at the conductors puz-
zled face  youll find it out anyway its

jp-

  she pulled out from where it had been
tucked up at her feet a basket with a pug-dog
sleeping the sleep of the lazy well-fed pet

    i couldnt bear to have him away from me
even one single night hes never been away
from muwer has oo ducky daddlins so
i smuggled him aboard the train in this
basket

pleasing the children

  another conductor one whose run is a
well-patronized train of sleepers that moves
out of new york late in the afternoon found
his car rapidly getting into a mild turmoil
one night because of a crying baby its
young mother was traveling alone and could
do nothing with the child she looked worn-
out the book of rules said nothing about
an emergency of this sort but mr conductor
stepped quietly up to the berth and talked
soothingly for a few moments to the mother
then he emerged in the aisle with the baby
in his arms

  there was something about brown that
gave every one confidence in him the tired
mother breathed a sigh of relief-the first for
a long while a little more and she was in
a doze the big man in uniform fondled
the tiny bundle he was holding talked to it
in a crooning voice walked with it moving it
from side to side with the swaying motion of
the car the crying grew less and less the
baby dropped asleep

  in the smoking-room the conductor for
several hours kept up a patient vigil over his
little charge

  such a case as this is unusual but any
number of times the sleeping-car conductor
has made himself solid with children by en-
tertaining them before bed-time a few such
characteristics of one of these men may do
worries of a sleeping-car con

ill

even more for his general popularity and
effectiveness than with the children

  to the wise and capable conductor all these
things are part of the discipline on the
long runs of the west a sleeping-car con-
ductor has often but one car in his charge in
the east he is the captain over several with
a porter for each a maid and a barber if
the train be a limited and perhaps an
assistant to relieve him of the detail work

routine of the sleeper

  the handling of the tickets- collecting
in railroad language-is the smallest part of
his work that and making out his report
take but little time on a long night

  one conductor now in new york tells a
story of how on one run several years ago
in the nights tiresome watches he used to
make out his report slowly and in full detail
and when he had finished it tear it up and
write it all over again merely to have some-
thing to do

  there are hours of the night that drag
heavily on a conductor for they are event-
less and there is no work to be done on
some runs a conductor is allowed to spell his
porters and each steals a few hours sleep
on others a conductor must keep awake to
the end of the run in any event he must
sleep with one eye open lest he may be needed

  the best conductor the experts of rail-
roading say is the man who makes his pres-
ence constantly felt who is unobtrusively in
evidence frequently quietly following up
the porter to see that he is attentive to pa-
trons besides keeping the car in apple-pie
order inviting requests and questions from
the buyers of berths

  it is remarkable these same experts say
the difference of men in this regard some
will seem to see everything and can always
be found instantly others while they are
still good conductors and with whom no
definite fault can be found are precisely the
reverse for they do not become a real part of
their train

two tickets for one berth

  what brings out the sleeping-car con-
ductor and shows his true powers as a tacti-
cian are the cases of duplicate sales mis-
takes will occur in the ticket offices of the
big cities a train in readiness for the night
is about to start people are being escorted
to or are personally finding their seats
porters and conductor are alert there is all

the comfortable bustle of the luxurious
string of sleepers with their array of well-
to-do passengers who have paid for the best
and look for quick service and no friction
whatever as their due

  there are two claimants for a certain
berth the sleeping-car tickets of both are
in order somebody in an agency has blun-
dered but the train is already in motion
however the fault the remedy is the prov-
ince of the sleeping-car conductor and he
must make arrangements that will satisfy
everybody

  the company takes the ground that even
if one person can prove he bought a berth
a week before it was sold to the other person
one has precisely as good a claim for sat-
isfaction as the other both have paid their
money the error is no fault of either the
conductor must take this view of it and nip
in the bud what is apt to grow into a good-
sized row for the average traveler does not
take such matters calmly as a rule

  it is the personality of the conductor that
saves the company from embarrassment or
brings down upon it in a sharp letter to the
management a strenuous kick a clever
conductor who knows how to play on the
minds of men and women by sympathy by
interest by special little maneuvers at which
lie is a master hand can twist the aggrieved
one into a new phase of thought and make
him feel perfectly happy in a much inferior
berth sometimes the same result is gained
by a little trick of which the traveler is never
aware

a clever ruse

  a row was brewing on a certain sleeper
that had just pulled out of chicago two
men had tickets for one berth one of them
jumped aboard at the last moment when
the conductor looked at the second mans
ticket he saw that it was the same old story
but he had always found it profitable to
pretend to examine such tickets carefully

  that gave him a few seconds to plan out
a little campaign and size up his man

  the ticket like the one he had examined a
moment before called for lower  an idea
occurred to him the car was not full as
if by accident he turned his back and
hastily glanced at his car diagram lower
 the next was not taken he made a hasty
mark with his pencil and wheeled back to
confront them

  its all right he said cheerily just
a clerical error that doesnt mean anything


the railroad mans magazine

the clerk wrote down    on your ticket
instead of  s your berths   see its
marked here on the diagram

  the man never knew that the conductor
had ingeniously gotten the best of him

  conductors of sleeping-cars are required
to report duplicate sales but very frequently
they do not it seems to be one of the most
difficult things in railroading to get a con-
ductor to report a duplicate sale when he has
adjusted the controversy with no ill-feeling
so far as can be seen

  what was there to report asked con-
ductor d when called to task in the trouble-
some case of miss and mrs robinson because
he had sent in no record

	 i fixed it up all right inside of five min-
utes everybody was satisfied nobody
complained

   none the less this case that did not appear
to matter turned out to be an important one
with regard to the company mrs and miss
robinson were going to toledo they re-
served their sleeping-car berths at new york
two weeks in advance and on the afternoon
of their journey they boarded the train in
plenty of time

   some five minutes before the train started
a burly man with a loud voice came up the
cars steps and told the porter to show him to
berth 

  ah tink dats taken sah answered the
porter lady dar sah

   nonsense said the man  i just bought
it

  it was too important a question for the
porter to settle he went for the conductor
after making the man temporarily comfort-
able

  when the conductor came he found the
mans ticket perfectly correct except that miss
robinson was occupying the seat he claimed
questioning developed that the women had
bought their tickets long before and were
fully entitled to the seats they held

  the man did not deny that women had
rights but in a blustering rude and assert-
ive manner he abused all railroads and
sleeping-cars in general the conductor got
him to shut off his flow of profanity and to
accept a berth a little way off from the one
he had purchased

  ill take it the burly man growled
but i wouldnt unless it happened to be a
lower berth i tell vou its scoundrellv the

     	j l

way you impose upon people and take money
under false pretenses

  the man was soon quieted and the con-
ductor thought he had done well he had
successfully handled a very angry man but
he had not counted upon the women who
had received the full effect of the interrupted
tirade they had not complained they had
said very little though he could see many
things he had not noticed that they had been
terrified at the mans manner and had been
thrown into a state of nervousness

  miss robinson who had been particularly
upset did not recover easily toledo was
reached safely and one of the first things
miss robinson told a cousin they were visit-
ing was their experience

   its the most annoying thing i ever
heard said the cousin wait till george
comes home

  george happened to be a man of big in-
fluence in that part of ohio

  you leave it to me george said when
he heard the story  its disgraceful ill
write to-morrow

  at his office the next morning he wrote a
lettertb the sleeping-car officials the letter
did not mince matters it was so forcible
that it went from one official to another it
took some time for the company to make
peace with the two families

where recruits are found

  the best conductors for sleeping-cars come
from the ranks of men who have failed in
other walks of life disheartened people are
of course impossible for this work but the
man who has held his grip in misfortune is
apt to be a very acceptable candidate men
who have address experience and facility in
handling persons of both sexes and all social
grades are eventually the ones chosen to fill
vacancies

   the permanence of such a position steadies
a man that has been drifting aimlessly a
large proportion of them stick to it and find
the work congenial the maximum pay is
only ninety-five dollars a month

            the trouble that came to tom tower
            when he took tinklers out of town

principal trouble with tink-
was stubbornness - plain
irnished stubbornness of the
t supreme quality he was
l with it his parents had
been born with it and his ances-
tors-so far as any authority on his particular
species knew-possessed it therefore he
came by it honestly

  tinklers belonged to that part of the ani-
mal kingdom known as jackasses some
people qualify them by the more dignified
name of donkey but in all his deportment
tinklers never rose above the plane of a
real unmitigated jackass

  he had passed his early days in and
around the little town of nowich he never
stood much more than four feet in his unshod
feet and his shaggy coat his long ears and
his monotonous uncanny bray were as well
known to the people of that prosperous village
as was the statue of their first governor-
bronzed and weather-beaten-standing in the
center of the public square

  just who of the ten thousand citizens of
nowich owned tinklers nobody knew-and
likewise nobody cared he simply roamed
hither and yon devouring the luxuriant grass
of the roadside in summer and in winter
becoming an object of charity for any stable-
keeper who would take him in at night and
give him a handful of hay

  for seven years lie kept things going and
he prospered in his own particular way for
instance he had a habit of getting squarely
in front of approaching automobiles where
he would stand like a statue and even a
lusty beating would not make him budge
once an infuriated tourist put on all power
and dashed squarely into tinklers saying
i dont care who owns the beast ill pay
the damages willingly 

  but tinklers only got mixed up in the
     rr

mechanism and was extracted without any
damage to himself save a few scratches while
the tourist ruined a three-thousand-dollar car
and had to takethe train home

  then tinklerss pet jcy was to plant him-
self directly in front of the nowich trolley as
it came down main street and bray defiance
it usually took the combined efforts of six
men to remove him to the gutter and each
would administer a kick for good measure
but tinklerss hide was immune to pain
everybody in the town had either kicked or
struck him at one time or another

  with the passing of time his bray increased
with his stubbornness and his general be-
havior become such that he was a menace to
the municipality he took to braying at
night for no reasonable cause whatsoever
the residents of the town were rapidly be-
coming victims of a form of nocturnal wake-
fulness that was rapidly undermining their
nervous systems visitors actually refused to
pay their hotel bills because of the unholy
noise and one or two of the oldest inhabitants
filially threatened to sue the municipality if
it were not abated

  that was the final straw

   you really intend to sue   asked the
mayor of nowich of old peter hines one
day

  and peter who was close to his ninety-
seventh year and openly challenged any other
nonogenarian to dispute his longevity said

   you can betcher boots mr mayor i
mean ter i aint a goin to be driv to a early
death by the brayin o thet jeckuss ef he
aint put out o this here taown afore next
moon ill sue yer fer six hundred dollars

  that was a terrible defi it was more
than nowich could stand it sounded the end
of tinklers-so far as nowich was con-
cerned

  there was nothing for the municipality to


the railroad mans magazine

do but take action so at the next meeting
of the town council a resolution properly
framed by his honor the mayor was unani-
mouslypassed authorizing that tinklers be
declared a public nuisance and that he be
sold at public auction  to the highest bidder
thereof at  am july   anno
domini in the public square

  the announcement was printed in some
half a dozen papers in the towns around
nowich for the nimble-minded municipality
believed that no one in the home town would
bid a cent for poor tinklers they were right
in their conjecture for on the morning of the
sale just twenty people lined up in front of
the auctioneers stand and fifteen of them
were recognized as strangers

  on the previous night tinklers had been
roped and deliberately carried to the public
square where he was staked to a tree some
ten feet of rope circumscribed his area but a
goodly supply of oats kept him in decent
temper until the auction was over

  he didnt seem to mind the crowd that
gathered around the auctioneers stand he
remained perfectly quiet and passive and he
looked mighty good to tom tower who
had come eight miles from new blunden
after reading the alluring  ad

  the first bid for tinklers was eight cents
it came from a dealer in live stock who had
heard of the donkeys bad manners and who
thought that he could be purchased cheap
but this prospective buyer had not reckoned
on tom tower tom quickly raised his bid
to a dollar

  the auctioneer warbled off  doll-doll-
doll-do-i-hear-the dollaquarter do-i-hear-the
dollaquarter-dolla-dolla-dollaquarter with
the wonderfully indiscernible sing - song of
his calling some unknown did bid in that
amount the live-stock dealer went over and
took a close look at tinklers then returned
and announced  one dollar and thirty
cents

  one-thirty-five called tom

  thats more than ill give said the
live-stock man and he elbowed his way
through the crowd and went his way

  in vain did that auctioneer try to raise
tom towers bid he used every artifice
of his kind to make some one say  one-
fifty  even but there was not a whimper from
the crowd he lured every voluble sound in
his system in pronouncing that figure but to
no purpose only the little children present
cared a whit they liked to hear him say it

  finally he changed his tactics look
ladies and gentlemen he said gesticulating

with oratorical nicety look at that noble
animal grazing there and tell me if you ever
saw a more perfect picture of docile decorum
why ladies and gentlemen there is not a
more perfect jackass in all this county in
breeding in deportment in looks-he is a
perfect specimen of his kind and i am bid
the paltry sum of one dollar andthirty-five
cents for him ladies and gentlemen was
there ever such a sacrifice do i hear the
one-fifty do i hear one-fifty

  the spectators looked into his face like so
man- mutes

   do i hear the one-forty   he thundered

  still the crowd was speechless tom wick-
ersham began to feel for his change

  ladies and gentlemen continued the
auctioneer leaning far over and speaking
very softly as if he were telling some awful
secret  am i obliged to let this valuable
animal go for the paltry sum of one dollar
and thirty-five cents do you understand
what this sacrifice means gentlemen i ap-
peal to you is this valuable jackass worth
at least fifty dollars as a beast of burden to be
sacrificed for-

   sacrifice and be hanged  piped the
shrill voice of peter hines who was watch-
ing the proceedings

  of course everybody laughed and tthe auc-
tioneer saw that further persuasion was use-
less

   going-going  he said raising his mal-
let aloft he hesitated and repeated very
slowly  going-going then he stopped
there was one more chance if any one wanted
to raise the limit

  gone he shouted the mallet came
down with a thud hes yours mister
said the auctioneer turning to tom and
tom who had the necessary sum ready
stepped up and paid and tinklers was his-
hide and hoof

  then came the rub

  tinklers had to be removed to new blun-
den

  he seemed loath to leave the oats which
had been provided to keep him on his good
behavior while the municipality of nowich
was being enriched by the sale of him

  there was- a small supply left and tom
took it for granted that it went with the
donkey so he gathered them into his hat
let tinklers have a sniff of them untied him
and started down the road

  the last that nowich saw of its trouble was
tom in the lead deftly manipulating the hat
of oats as a decoy and tinklers following a
willing captive his ears sticking out a foot
flagging the donkey



ahead of him and some ten feet of good
inch-rope dragging from his neck

  he followed patiently for about two miles
then he began to wonder if something new
and strange hadnt come into his life he
looked tom over for a moment then shot
out his nose humped his back and emitted
die most piercing bellow that ever penetrated
his new owners ears

  then turned his back on tom and looked
somewhat sprightly in the direction of no-
wich tom surmised that tinklerss inten-
tions werent honest so he began to maneuver
for the rope he was just in time for tink-
lers had just got into the return motion tom
gave the rope a mighty lunge and the sur-
prised tinklers turned

  come on yelled tom

  he tugged at the rope and tinklers fol-
lowed unconcernedly for about half a mile
suddenly he got the notion in his head that
he had better stop he planted his four hoofs
so firmly in the ground that tom couldnt
budge him tom tugged and tugged and
cursed and tugged again but tinklers was
his old self tom got behind him and tried
to push he caught him by the ears and twist-
ed them till they must have pained he tickled
his ribs with a whisk of grass-but tinklers
only stood as adamant as if he had been
carved in stone

  tom saw that such tactics were useless so
he resorted to more diplomatic means he
produced the hatful of oats and let tinklers
have a taste then he walked down the road
about fifty feet and shook the hat and called
here tinklers here tinklers

  tinklers moved on and got another nibble
and tom proceeded another fifty feet and
used the same demonstration and again
tinklers responded this scheme of proce-
dure was kept going for about half a mile
finally tom noticed that about one more
bite and the oats would be at an end then
what 

  he took in his surroundings and estimated
that he had about five miles yet to go at
the rate of a bite of oats for every fifty feet
it would require about a ton of feed before
he reached new blunden

  the oats did give out but for two laps of
fifty feet tom successfully decoyed tinklers
into believing that the hat did contain some-
thing however the third time it failed
tinklers brayed his keen dislike at being
fooled and again turned his head in the
direction of nowich

  tom lured him with bunches of freshly
picked grass and soft words he called

tinkle tinkle tinkle and snapped his
fingers to add to the enticement-but tin-
klers was wise he wanted oats or he want-
ed home

  tom picked up die rope and put it over
his shoulder he managed to catch tinklers
off his guard and gave him a lunge which
nearly took the animal off its feet the mo-
mentum was in tonis favor and it kept so
for some little distance but tom could grad-
ually feel it grow weaker as tinklers slowly
but surely got his feet into the earth

  tom tugged and pulled ahead some
hundred or so feet the double tracks of the
midland lines crossed the road i must
get him over the tracks quoth tom to his
soul  then i can tie him to the fence-post
and go to a near-by farm and buy some more
oats

  it was nip and tuck between man and
beast first one gained ground and then the
other the progress was in toms favor it
was slow but certain it was a mighty tussle
and it was telling on him he was fast losing
strength but he felt that he could hold out
until he crossed the track tinklers had his
head down and was trying hard for a footing
his tongue hung out and the rope cut cruelly
at his neck-but he was game

   finally the track was reached it needed
only a few feet more however and there-
not twenty feet away-was the good stout post
to which he would hitch his recalcitrant pur-
chase while he hustled for more of die decoy

  but it happened-as it seemed bound to
happen-that the minute tinklers struck the
middle of the track on which the east-bound
trains passed he got the best of the tug-of-
war and came to a full stop

  tom was all in he sat down in the mid-
dle of the road and pulled and the more he
pulled the less tinklers budged the don-
keys feet seemed glued to the boards between
the rails once tom slacked on the rope
just the slightest but this only gave tinklers
a chance to plant his feet the firmer

   there he stood his ears laid back  his
neck and his long nose pointed directly at
toni-and there he stood when die plymouth
rock limited loomed up in the distance

  engineer dorgan of the plymouth rock
spied the obstruction he was making a
good sixty miles per and was ten minutes be-
hind his schedule at that

   he didnt want to stop and he began to
sound the most fancy score in whistling that
was ever heard in that vicinity tom fairly
leaped behind tinklers and began to shove

   tinklers was shoveless he just wouldnt


the railroad mans magazine

be moved dorgan tied down the whistle-
lever and put on the air tom shoved con-
jured kicked cajoled and performed other
stunts first at tinklerss head then at his
tail-but tinklers had made up his mind

  there was only one thing for dorgan to do
and that was to come to a full stop he ran
close to tinklers jammed down the air
jumped down from his cab and the conductor
and several trainmen soon joined him

  what in the name of sam hill do you
mean by getting that thing on the track just
as we were coming along   asked dorgan

  tom was breathless he couldnt speak

  get him off shouted dorgan as he
rushed up to tinklers and gave him a push
dorgan was not a light-weight but the man-
ner in which he rebounded after landing
against tinklers gave him some assurance of
the terrible plight of poor tom

   weve got to get him off the track some-
how broke in the conductor dorgans look
was a sufficient answer for so foolish a ques-
tion

  lets lift him off said the fireman

   thats the talk billy said dorgan
 come on all together 

  dorgan and billy got at one end of the
beast and tom and the conductor at the
other two trainmen added their strength at
the middle and the sextet began to maneuver

  so soon as tinklers realized that he was
being propelled against his wishes he bit and
kicked and brayed and his captors were not
for carrying him far they managed to get
him off the track however and they set him
down on all fours just by the cylinder with
his head facing in the direction of nowich

  now let us get out of here said dorgan
as he and the fireman climbed into the cab

  the conductor gave the sign and dorgan
opened the throttle a long hot spray shot
out from the exhaust as the drivers turned

it hit tinklers squarely and all the pent-up
energy of his stubborn soul was suddenly
exerted in a desire to run

  if he had been shot from a cannon he
couldnt have made greater speed

  we certainly got him going said billy
to dorgan as he watched tinklers hoofing
it along the pike

  if we could go that fast for the next fifty
miles wed make up all weve lost answered
dorgan

  but tom was almost speechless he sat
 a tie hoping that tinklers would stop but
for once there was evidently no stop in tink-
lers

  that donkey was a lemon tom finally
said as he rose and turned his steps in the
direction of new blunden  guess ill let
him go anyhow

  the good citizens of nowich that night
went to the first peaceful sleep they had
known in ages after heartily congratulating
themselves on getting rid of their pest and
adding to the town treasury at the same time

    i tell ye boys i feel like i added another
quarter century to my life ejaculated old
pete hines as he said good-night

  about one oclock in the morning pete was
dreaming something long and loud and
very familiar sounded in his ears he start-
ed as if in a nightmare he sat up in bed
and pinched himself and then he listened

   guess i was dreamin piped old pete
as he snuggled under the blankets again

  then tinklers in his familiar abode in
the public square emitted his choicest and
most unmusical melody so the populace would
know how glad he was to be home

  old pete started and sat up it was
neither a dream nor a nightmare

   im jiggered ef i dont take the law of
this taown in my own hands he said as
he got up and reached for his gun

  the g p a and his job

by thaddeus s dayton

getting business for a railroad by persuading the prospective traveler to
become a passenger over its lines seems at first glance a most hopeless
sort of undertaking but a little study of the workings of the g p as
department in a prosperous railroad company tells a different story there are
more ways than one to fill up the plush-covered seats

     passenger-trains that continue to run with empty cars soon vanish from the
schedule no matter how well they may be operated or how low the running ex-
penses are kept

     the general passenger agent has little or no authority over the men who operate
the trains and keep clear the right-of-way but nevertheless the part he plays in
the game of railroading goes far toward determining how much rolling-stock
shall be kept in motion and whether the passengers shall be few or many-and
too he is pretty good when it comes to increasing dividends

the man who cares for the comfort and convenience of the traveling
public must be a student of human nature able to tell
the real from the pinchbeck

eneral passenger agents earn
from  to  a year
and sometimes even more it
is one of the most desirable
places in the railway service on
the long road that leads to the
top and the question is often asked how can
a youth who has just entered the general pas-
senger department or one who has been
employed there for more or less time rise
steadily so that he may some day fill the chief
chair in the inner sanctum instead of con-
tinuing to occupy an undistinguished seat in
one of the outer offices

  it is impossible to formulate any set of
rules to bring about this desirable result
the best that can be done is to point out to
the anxious or interested reader who is am-
bitious to climb far up the railroad ladder
some of the things that he should and should
not do if he he wishes to succeed

  these caution and danger signals as it
were have been gathered from talks with

some of the most eminent passenger officials
in this country who however for one reason
or another have asked that their names be
omitted from this article

  before entering upon this part of the sub-
ject however it is necessary to make a be-
ginning with a brief but comprehensive de-
scription of the intricate machinery which
constitutes the organization of the average
general passenger agents office it is a curi-
ous fact that but few of the public at large
or even the members of such a department
itself fully understand how it is made up
and what the actual duties of the various
sub-departments are all of which on a suc-
cessful road constitute from top to bottom
the reason why the trains are always well
filled and the passengers contented

  to begin with there are about seven hun-
dred passenger agents of railroads great and
small in theunited states they sold to
the general public last year more than half a
billion dollars worth of transportation to


the railroad mans magazine

be exact the railways of this country carried
 passengers-equal to half the
population of the entire earth in the number
of fares paid each one of the seven hun-
dred-odd general passenger agents had to
keep his staff continually busy in order to get
his share of the money paid for moving this
vast number of people from one place to an-
other his passenger-trains had to run each
day no matter how few they carried it was
his business however to keep the seats filled

  the organization of a general passenger
agents office on a large and busy railway
does not differ materially from that of any
other line except in matters due to local con-
ditions on some of the big systemshow-
ever there is a general traffic manager who
outlines the policies of both the freight and
passenger departments

  the specific head of the passenger depart-
ment however is the general passenger agent
who is held directly responsible for the get-
ting and keeping of the business of swiftly
and comfortably transporting people to and
fro he has to know human nature thor-
oughly he must know how far to go which
means how much money to spend in catering
to the personal whims luxurious tastes and
individual vanities of the great traveling
public

a student of human nature

  his must be die mature wisdom to decide
how many trains shall be run and at what
points they shall stop to pick up passengers
he must get his share of the business from
connecting lines at the various great traffic
gateways like new york buffalo chicago
and st louis in short he must sell all the
passenger transportation that his road can
turn out and the cost of delivering the goods
must leave a fair margin of profit

  eveiy general passenger agent has a chief
clerk who relieves him of an enormous mass
of detail work practically all the sub-de-
partments report to the general passenger
agent through this chief clerk one of his
principal duties is supposed to be to read
and sort out the vast amount of mail that
comes addressed to the general passenger
agent every day in the year

  this is possible for the chief clerk on
one of the smaller roads but in a big office
this task is generally delegated to one or
more assistants who have the experience and
intelligence necessary to run swiftly through
the great stacks of letters sort them properly
for distribution and unerringly cull out for

their chiefs attention any that are of espe-
cial importance

duties of the chief clerk

  the next in line in the outer office is the
assistant chief clerk he sits in the room
where the public enters and sometimes has
to sift the wants of perhaps a thousand peo-
ple a day who call and ask for the general
passenger agent this assistant chief clerk
possesses the same qualifications that every
member of the general passenger department
should have but developed to an astonish-
ing degree of efficiency he must be per-
fectly informed about everything that has
happened or can happen in the passenger
department

  one of the most important divisions of
the general passenger office is the rate de-
partment in the new york central gen-
eral offices this is in charge of a chief clerk
who has fifteen experts under him through
passenger rates-that is rates covering the
transportation of passengers by two or more
different companies-are continually chang-
ing these changes arise from different
causes

  recently for example the states of iowa
and illinois enacted legislation making the
maximum passenger fare on railroads within
their boundaries two cents per mile

  this of course immediately upset all die
through rates of the railways entering or
crossing those states the rate departments
of the railroads interested had to refigure and
agree upon an entirely new set of fares to be
charged and had also to arrive at the proper
division of the proceeds of ticket sales it
is the duty of the rate clerk to keep the
general passenger agent continually posted
on any important changes in through rates
and the proportions accruing to each road
together with his deductions on the general
causes or effects of sucli changes

departments controlled by the g p a

  the ticket redemption bureau is a depart-
ment with which the general public is more
familiar if a person buys a round-trip
ticket and only uses it one way he can send
the unused portion to the general passenger
agent of the road he bought it from and
very quickly receive the companys check for
its value

  it does not matter whether the ticket is from
new york to tarry town and back or from
new york to san francisco and return
the g p a and his job



after the ticket redemption bureau has
passed upon and authorized the refund the
customer gets his money back in a remark-
ably short space of time

  the advertising department has charge of
getting up the folders advertising literature
time-tables and posters that are used for
keeping the railroad continually before the
public eye and seeing that an adequate sup-
ply of time-tables is continually available
at the innumerable places where the public
may wish to find them it is one of the
duties of this department to take the official
time-tables gotten up by the operating de-
partment which relate only to the move-
ment of trains from one end of the road to
the other and to arrange them for publica-
tion so that ever possible connection with
other roads is clearly shown as well as con-
densed time-tables to points far distant from
the terminus of its own line

  that this is no small task may be more
fully realized when it is explained that these
time-tables are supposed to be absolutely ac-
curate even in regard to the movement of
the through trains over lines thousands of
miles away a sudden change in the time-
cards of any single line means correspond-
ing changes in the time-tables of all the other
roads the advertising department there-
fore has to keep continually on the alert in
order that the public may always be sup-
plied with exact information

  if a person desires a special car or a spe-
cial train no matter through whom he orders
it it is the excursion bureau of the general
passenger-agents office that attends to the
details

transportation for travelers

  this same sub-department as its name in-
dicates also has direct charge of handing
all the excursion business of the road it
does not solicit this traffic but simply at-
tends to caring for it as fast as the orders
come in from the district passenger-agents in
or out of town

  the last of the large sub-departments of
the general passenger-agents office is that
which has charge of receiving from the print-
ers and issuing to the various ticket-agents
the enormous number of railway tickets sold
each year these tickets are of every kind
from the little piece of thick- pasteboard good
only for a ride between points on the issuing
line up to the yard-long strips that will carry
a passenger from new york to the other end
of the country and back

   none of the departments immediately sur-
rounding the general passenger-agents office
is directly concerned with getting business
they are necessarily active in taking care of
the business that other sub-departments se-
cure some of these sub-departments are the
district passenger-agents offices and their
sub-agents which are scattered throughout
every business center in the united states

how the trains are filled

   if the agent of an eastern line in denver
for example hears of one or more people
who are about to start for new york he
loses no time in calling on them and en-
deavoring to induce them to travel over his
line from chicago eastward in new york
city each of the great trunk lines has a con-
siderable staff of men who are continually
drumming up business while they do not
overlook the solitary individual who desires
to travel they are particularly keen in their
pursuit of large and small bodies of people
who may be induced to make journeys over
their particular line

   conventions and other large movements of
people are especially sought after and some-
times plans are made for them as much as
a year in advance there are several from
each passenger department who make it their
especial business to look after the transporta-
tion of the hundreds of theatrical companies
that leave new york every season others
pay particular attention to all sorts of politi-
cal people and their gatherings

   still others keep close watch of the hotels
on the lookout for parties of people who may
desire to travel westward still others cir-
culate among the great mercantile houses who
send out armies of traveling men another
class of diese specialists who solicit passen-
ger traffic in new york are the men who go
down the bay to meet the incoming steam-
ships from every corner of the earth they
too are especially in search of parties of
travelers

  they do not of course run about the
decks buttonholing every first-class passen-
ger but quietly secure all the information
possible from the ships people and then
follow up their clues unobtrusively but with
certainty

   after all it is the getting of the business
that counts and these ever-alert men con-
tinually in touch with every phase of life
get a training and experience that is inval-
uable a youth cannot become a full-
fledged and successful passenger solicitor at


the railroad mans magazine

once but it is one of the rounds of the lad-
der that it is desirable to rest on in the climb
up to the chiefs chair at the top

the school of the g p a

   surveying the vista of the work i have
done since i entered the railway service
about twenty-five years ago said the g p
a of one of the biggest western railway
systems  i should say that the hardest thing
about the general passenger agents job is
the getting of it if a man has the ability
and experience to climb up to that place the
bulk of his work is over

   he should know more about the passen-
ger business than any of his subordinates
and as much as any of his competitors there-
fore all he has to do is to keep his wits about
him and let his actions be guided by the
lamp of experience if he is the rare kind
of man who never makes the same mistake
twice he need fear nothing and the exceed-
ingly responsible duties of his office will rest
very lightly on his shoulders

    but what should a young man do to
get the experience so he too may some day
sit in the easiest chair in the best office and
give orders  he must work unceasingly
learn and remember he must train him-
self to have the patience of the patriarchs
the suavity of a trained diplomat and be a
compendium of knowledge which if it re-
lated to some of the sciences would give him
a professors chair

  all these qualities may be developed if
they latently exist in the boys system of-
fice training first i should say so as to get
the run of how the big machine is put to-
gether then later on when he is capable
a careful try-out at soliciting

  let him always be on the lookout for a
new and better job in the same department
the more he learns and assimilates and
store away for future use the more valuable
he is i believe that during the score of
years that i was studying to be g p a as
it were i filled about every job in the de-
partment

   i venture to say right now with all due
modesty that i could step out and do almost
anything in this office or in the branches
outside quite as well or a little better than
it is being done by my subordinates from
opening the mail and copying letters up to
getting a shade the best of it on rate divi-
sions

  what should a young man avoid if he
wants to succeed he must not be afraid

of being too pushing the world generally
makes away for the young man in a hurry
he must never shirk anything no matter how
disagreeable the duty he cannot be a time-
server for the hours of labor in the passen-
ger department are not regulated by any
union

   he must never be contented but he must
not show it by that i mean that his am-
bition to get the bosss job must never sleep
these are only a few of the things but there
is one other that is almost as valuable as all
the rest put together the young man who
rises high is the one who doesnt dissipate
who always gets a good nights sleep when-
ever his work will let him who always keeps
in the best of physical condition

   but after all if a man has got it in him
hell win out no matter where you put him
in this business or any other

pointers from men who know

  the g p a of a big eastern trunk line
was asked how he got his job  worked
for it unremittingly for a good many years
he answered  i started in this very office
that room outside there where you entered
slitting open stacks of letters when i was a
boy of eighteen that was and is the hum-
blest round of the ladder in the g p as
office

   i was told to open the letters straighten
them out see that the enclosures were secure-
ly attached and then place them on the chief
clerks desk for distribution there were
hundreds of letters in those days where there
are thousands every morning now so i
made it a point to find out as much as i
could about each of the departments in our
office and then to read the letters and en-
deavor to sort them myself

   of course i always placed the different
lots all in one big pile on the chief clerks
desk i had been here about four months
when the chief clerk called me in one after-
noon told me he knew what i had been
doing and in future to put the letters in
separate piles just as i would assort them
for distribution and to lay aside any that
seemed of sufficient importance for him to
look after personally

how one g p a got his job

   later on i learned stenography and
found out what sort of answers were sent i
climbed up a little every year always grab-
bing every new and better job that i saw and
the g p a and his job



somehow making good in it stenograph is
invaluable for a young man who wants to
rise quickly it puts him on the inside in
touch with the movement of things at once
and teaches him more in a year than he would
learn in some other position in live

   courtesy is the greatest asset however
in the passenger business as well as any
other i remember a typical instance that
happened the other day that cost a young
man his job just because he wasnt courteous
i went into one of our big ticket offices on
broadway an idea had just occurred to me
and i needed but one bit of technical informa-
tion to piece it out and make it valuable

  this bit of information was something
that under the interstate commerce commis-
sions rulings should be on file for the public
in all ticket offices i therefore asked the
young man in charge at the noon hour-he
didnt know me and i didnt tell him who i
was-what i wanted to know he answered
bruskly that he couldnt give me any such
information

   i told him why he should and asked him
to phone the g p as office if he didnt be-
lieve me he replied that that was a ticket
office and not a bureau of miscellaneous infor-
mation then i left so did the young man
later for employees of that sort are likely to
cost the road thousands of dollars in the
course of a year

   another class but an inoffensive one is
that which is made up of the patient plodders
who are content to do their work and no
more year after year satisfied with a small
increase in salary now and then some g p
as regard these as the backbone of the de
partment but i like better the pushing ag-
gressive fellow whose brain is continually on
the alert the passenger department in mv
opinion is no place for plodders if you run
trains a mile a minute and better youve got
to think and act at the same rate

what two men saw

  to be a close observer of things was the
hobby of one of the greatest passenger men
that new york ever knew a man came into
his office one day and asked for a job he
had been doing fairly well with another line
but had quit on account of some disagreement
the old g p a listened carefully

  all right he said im going to be
pretty busy for a few minutes suppose you
go dovvn-stairs and stand on the street corner
by the fruit-stand for ten minutes and then
come back and tell me what you saw

  the applicant was a little surprised but
obeyed without question in ten minutes he
was back

   w ell what did you see  asked the gen-
eral passenger agent

   w hy i saw a lot of people passing to and
from going into the station there was noth-
ing extraordinary about any of them on
the fruit-stand which appeared to be kept by
an italian or greek i dont know which
there was a lot of the finest and biggest red
apples i ever saw there was a lot of other
fruit too but the apples caught my eye

   what was he selling them for  

   i dont know but i can find out
where did the apples come from what
kind are they how much do they cost a
barrel  are they sweet or sour  

   i reallv do not know

a rare gift

  the g p a pressed a button a bright
alert clerk bustled in mr smith said
the g p a i wish youd put on your coat
and go down to the corner where the fruit-
stand is- and get me a couple of those red
apples no hurry-take a look around while
youre there and let me know if theres any-
thing you see that strikes you especially
smith was back in less than five minutes
and laid two big red apples on the chiefs
desk five cents- he remarked what
else do you know about em   inquired the
old g p a as he took a bite

   they cost the dealer  a barrel deliv-
ered there are between four hundred and
five hundred in each barrel so he makes a
good profit they are called spitzenburg
and they come from a competitive point on
our road not far from buffalo another line
seems to be hauling all of them-there is an
enormous crop and they are making up a
lot into cider it might be a good plan to
try an experiment and run a little excursion
down to that place from buffalo next sunday
-so that people can see the ground red with
apples and drink cider-

  thatll do smith good idea take it
up with the buffalo agent and see what he
thinks about it then the g p a turned
to the applicant  i dont see where we can
use you he remarked what im always
trying to get is the man who can see things
and turn the things he sees to account in a
business way the seeing eye and the dis-
cerning mind are rare gifts when combined
cultivate them and come and see me again
a few months from now good day
the locomotive general as she now appears in the union depot at chattanooga
tennessee drawn from a photograph

cotiright detroit piiotvgratk co

are general and hero identical

some new light on the history of andrewss famous locomotive which
makes it appear to have undergone a change of
name and structure

an old-time reader of the railroad mans
magazine residing in fishkill landing
new york has sent us with the illustration on the
opposite page what we believe to be an authentic
version of the circumstances surrounding the his-
tory of the famous locomotive of civil war times
commonly known as the  general which was
captured from the confederate forces by andrews
and his men serving under general o m mitchell
and which is now on exhibition in the union
depot at chattanooga tennessee

  the drawing of the hero which appears on
the opposite page is from an old print the origi-
nal of which we understand is in washington
the following is the exact reading matter on the
print engine hero destroyed partially by
rebels when evacuating atlanta ga this is the
engine used by mitchells men in their attempt to
bum the r r bridges they were caught upon
it and hung in atlanta ga accompanying report
of capt o m poe u s engrs series i vol
xxxyiii part i-pages  and  see also
report of j holt judge advocate gen u s
army series i vol x part i-page 

  we have received many letters from our readers
asking for information regarding this historic en-
gine and as there seems to be some doubt as to
whether the locomotive now on exhibition is really
the one in which andrews made his hair-raising
ride or whether it is only masquerading under a
new name we take pleasure in publishing the pic-
ture and following communication which may set
at rest any doubts regarding its identity

editor the railroad maxs magazine 

  for some time it has been my aim to discover
the first records containing the name of the loco-
motive used by andrews in his famous raid i

have examined the newspapers published in at-
lanta augusta charleston savannah richmond
and other southern cities published during the
months of april and may  which contain
accounts of the episode but not one of them men-
tions the name of the captured locomotive even
the report of judge-advocate holt in  throws
no light on the subject nor does the first edition
of the little volume by pittinger who was one of
the raiders and who in  wrote his account
of the expedition years later he revised the edi-
tion and gave the name of the locomotive as the
general which however we have every reason
to believe was not its original title

  in  a government photographer who had
secured a picture of the famous locomotive went
on record as stating that its name was the hero
and so he labeled the print i am sending you
why he should have misstated the name if it
was then the general is not easily understood
as like other members of the army he was pre-
sumably employed to depict the facts as he found
them

  therefore the earliest appearance on record of
andrewss engine is under the name of the  hero

  the solution of the difficulty probably lies in
assuming that the damaged locomotive ol the pic-
ture after the departure of the federal army
came again into the possession of the western and
atlantic railroad which overhauled it rebuilt the
damaged portions and set it to work substantially
a new engine under the name of the  general
it is reasonable to believe that the earlier title
soon faded from mens memories and it came to be
known by the name it now bears this hypothesis
will explain why the appearance of the hero is
so different from that of the  general

  the former with its supplementary frame clear-
ly belongs to the ante-bellum type sent out about
 by various locomotive builders such as hink-
ley the taunton works and others while the lat-
ter is of the post-bellum type


are general and hero identical



 the complete story of the gen-
 erals race for life was published
 in the railroad mans magazine
 for january  and contained the
 following extract which helps to
 throw some light on the des-
 perate daredevil undertaking
 after passing cartersville
 where andrews explained to
 the confederates that he was

the hero

drawn front an old frivt

  however all these things may be i am neverthe-
less very glad that the  general  has been pre-
served and set up where it can be seen by all travel-
ers who pass through chattanooga for it conveys
to this and future generations an example of the
trim and beautiful machines of bygone days

                        respectfully yours

i s

                        

  as i s slates there is little doubt that the
 hero  and the  general  are one and the same
as the first record containing the name
of the engine used by general mitchells
men is the government photograph pub-
lished above which we have every reason
to believe is correct moreover it is not
improbable that the locomotive was re-
christened after the episode in which it

  the pursuit was continued on the  yonah 
until kingston was reached at that point the
line was occupied by other trains the yonah
was abandoned and the  alfred shorter a loco-
motive belonging to the rome railroad was pressed
into service and used in pursuit as far as adairs-
ville there the texas was secured and used to
ringgold where the general was recaptured
andrews and his men having abandoned her at
that point and dispersed in various directions only
to be captured in the next few days

the writer was only a small boy
at the time but was old enough to
take cognizance of things that were
going on in that wonderful period
in our history and was present at
the execution of seven of the men
who took part in this dangerous
and exciting adventure-j t d
atlanta georgia

figured in honor of genera mitch-
ell under whom andrews served

  we are always glad to hear from
our readers in cases of this kind
and we are very grateful for the
solution to this historic puzzle which
i s has been kind enough to send us and the fol-
lowing letter from another reader will add to the
controversy

editor the railroad mans magazine

  in your june issue you have an article signed
 d p nashville in which he refers to a com-
munication in your april number from  i s
with reference to the locomotive general that
was captured by the andrews party in 

  it is very evident that neither i s nor d
p knows enough aboul the incident to enable
them to give a true history of the case

  the writer was a lad living in atlanta georgia
at the time and remembers the case as clearly as if
it had occurred only yesterday

  besides the general the captured locomotive
there were three other locomotives in the chase
w a fuller who was the conductor of the train
began the chase on a hand-car and continued on
the hand-car until he reached etowah where he
found and seized the old locomotive  yonah

carrying powder lo general beauregard they had
several close calls from being discovered but it was
not until they reached adairsville that the chase
really began when a shrill whistle split the air from
behind and andrews saw faint white puffs of steam
against the sky to the south then followed a
series of hair-raising episodes which have never
been duplicated in railroad history car after
car was uncoupled and dropped back to impede
the progress of the pursuing locomotive trestles
were set on fire cross ties were dropped on the
track but all to no avail

  fire your car shouted andrews to his men
who had now taken refuge in the baggage-car the
last remaining a fire was lighted and the burning
car was left standing in the middle of a bridge
while all hands climbed on the tender of the engine

  the greatest railroad cut

by peter mulligan

ever since the erie moved its terminal from piermont new york to
jersey city bergen hill has proved the one great stumbling-block in its
path with only a two-track tunnel through this giant barrier to carry the
stream of traffic the erie for many years lost millions of dollars because of its
inability to handle sufficient trains to meet existing conditions

     at length its adamantine enemy of solid trap-rock has been conquered and
the erie has thrown aside its bonds the rocky hillside of jersey heights has
been torn and riven for many months so that the deepest cut ever dug might
open the way for four more tracks the cry of the commuters has been stilled
and the erie has accomplished one of the greatest engineering feats in history

how the angry war-cry of a number of commuters begun six years ago
resulted in one of the most gigantic railroad
feats ever recorded

ngry commuters on the erie
i six years ago used to write
indignant letters to the rail-
road denouncing it for suf-
liboalf focating its passengers in
the bergen tunnel just out-
side jersey city the commuters were in
earnest but sometimes their letters were un-
consciously funny and the erie in a spirit
of jest used to print them on its time-tables

  for a railroad to joke in such a manner
made travelers scratch their heads and won-
der the idea of a railroad having a sense
of humor was beyond them to the public
a railroad is and always has been a
vicious soulless system absolutely inca-
pable of a joke but here was a railroad
that was poking fun at itself

  if the public had only known the eries
humor was double-edged it had already-
planned a unique construction to do away
with the nuisance and it could well afford to
take part in the fun now that this work is
completed in the form of the new combina-
tion cut and tunnel through the heart of
jersey city heights it is time for the rail-
road to have its second laugh even the

commuters smile now as they roll through it
with only four shadows passing over them-
tunnels so short and so high that they could
be passed off as viaducts if it were not worth
while remembering that they are the widest
tunnels in the world

  the cut or tunnel or whatever you wish to
call it is the greatest achievement of its kind
in this railroad age it has taken four years
to complete working under conditions that
required a strict and careful use of dynamite
and has cost the erie more millions than it
cares to talk about

  previously the trains leaving jersey city
plunged into a tunnel more than half a mile
long in which gases from the coal-smoke
were so thick that they ate out the rails every
six months

a change for the better

  to those going on long journeys the in-
cident of the tunnel was forgotten as soon
as the windows had been opened again but
to commuters who had to travel through it
twice every day it was very unpleasant

now however the trains mount an ele-


the railroad mans magazine

rated steel causeway on leaving the depot
and are soon swinging out on one of four
tracks far above the other railroads that criss-
cross within the narrow strip between bergen
hill and the north river

  before the passengers are aware of it they
are running at high speed in the deep cut
between the freshly blasted walls of rocks

  in quick succession the trains seem to pass
under a series of broad bridges there is no
smoke it is unnecessary to illuminate the
cars by the time the passengers have craned
their necks far enough to see the top of the
cut they have passed through the only tunnel
on the road between new york and chicago

  it all happens so quickly and smoothly
that it is very easy to pass directly through
this engineering marvel without paying any
attention to it i was in the cut after the
trains had been using it for a week and
although dozens passed i noticed very few
passengers looking out of the windows

  it was already commonplace to them
but if they had been down on the track
as i was listening to a l moorshead the
resident engineer telling the story of the
cut they would very likely have acquired a
new interest in it

  perhaps i was particularly impressed be-
cause i came upon it suddenly and unexpect-
edly i had been walking through the busy
streets of jersey city listening without real-
ly understanding much while moorshead
talked when he stepped off the street with-
out warning at the end of a board fence i
followed expecting a walk of some distance
but fetched up within ten feet at the head
of a steep rickety flight of stairs that led
down a sheer precipice almost a hundred feet
deep 

a man-made chasm

  below was a vast hole several times as long
as it was wide that had been blown in the
solid rock it was enormous a quarter full
of water it could easily have floated and hid-
den from the streetseveral battle-ships later
i discovered that it was one of the smallest of
the cuts

  just beyond was one deeper and longer
and on either end were others much longer
but not quite so deep none looked so big
to me however as i started down the rickety
steps

  at the very brink of the precipice was a
brick smoke-vent the side nearest the cut
had been exposed for many feet moorshead
explained that it was connected with the old
tunnel

   here i asked incredulously- right
alongside the cut

   yes and almost under it he explained
 at most there is only eighteen feet of rock
between that is why it was such a job to
make this cut and blow out the tunnels
dynamite goes down too you know i tell
you we needed good men and we had them

  the original intention of the erie had been
to blow a cut straight through bergen hill
regardless of expense but it proved to be im-
possible the hill was covered with houses
and was crossed by a number of important
thoroughfares including the hudson boule-
vard it would have meant the tying up of
all traffic except for occasional makeshift
bridges and this jersey city refused to per-
mit

blasting down to the old tunnel

  so it became necessary to blow the cut
without disturbing the streets above it
which could be done in only one way this
course was finally decided upon in spite of
the gigantic expense involved and four of
the main streets were left untouched while
the tunnels under them were blasted

  walking back and forth in the tunnel as
he directed the men moorshead explained to
me how the work had been accomplished

  the hill was attacked from many points
at once and holes were immediately sunk
sixty to eighty feet to get the slow tunnel
work under way as soon as possible the
first peckings did not amount to much and
the populace of jersey city heights walked
from one hole to another with undisguised
contempt but before long there were dyna-
mite shocks that brought in some of the
householders with claims for fallen plaster

  then came the huge derricks beside the
holes to lift out rock in pieces weighing tons
and improvised tracks for work-trains from
that time on to the people of jersey city
heights it was merely a matter of how much
deeper the holes were going to be but to the
men on the job there were other troubles

  cold figures give only a partial idea of
such an undertaking the cut completed is
forty-four hundred feet long with a road-bed
fifty-eight feet wide making the road-bed in
the tunnels wider by eight feet than in any
other railroad tunnel the next widest is the
tunnel under tenth and eleventh avenues
leading from the tubes under the north river
into the pennsylvania railroad depot in new
york city

altogether there were removed five hun-
the greatest railroad cut



dred thousand cubic yards of blue trap-rock
one of the meanest kinds of stone to handle
and one hundred and sixty thousand cubic
yards of dirt to do this required two
hundred and fifty thousand pounds of
dynamite and when it was safe charges
containing as high as one hundred and fifty
pounds were exploded

  in sinking the original line of blasts the
holes were all on the far side of the proposed
cut as remote as possible from the old tunnel
which was in constant use the nearer the
work approached the old tunnel the more
careful it had to be done its progress was
slower and infinitely more difficult than if
there had been no old tunnel to worry about
but the tunnel was there and a single piece
of rock dislodged from its roof might mean
a bad wreck there were often heavy
blasts almost over the tunnel but it was never
seriously disturbed however and the trains
ran through it in safety

  to know just how much dynamite could
be used without endangering the tunnel was
one of the most important problems that the
builders had to face many men had a hand
in this but the one who did the most pains-
taking work and did it without causing
trouble was john f smith the grizzled old
blasting inspector known to every railroad
contractor in this country

some fancy blasting

  he did the same work on the smaller
lackawanna cut which passes into bergen
hill at the west end of the erie cut and can
tell offhand by the look of the rock just how
much powder it will stand and how far the
shock will carry his information on all
things relating to blasting is wide and exact
blit he needed every bit of it when he was
clearing away rock by the ton within twenty
feet of the roof of the old tunnel

  if the tunnel had been higher than the cut
there would have been less trouble but with
the tunnel lower and the downward shock
from dynamite even with the greatest care
some rock was bound to become loose in the
roof of the tunnel to see that this did not
cause trouble required constant attention

  the dynamiting periods were selected to
correspond to the times when there was the
least traffic and what little traffic there was
had to be hastened or delayed until after the
roof had been inspected such periods on a
busy road were of course short which some-
what complicated matters

  trouble was generally expected opposite

the points where the blasts had been fired
and warning was always sent before the
blasts were exploded indicating the exact po-
sition of the blasts for this purpose the
smoke-vents served as excellent guides as
they could be seen plainly and at once both
from the inside and the outside

death lurked overhead

  as soon as a blasting period arrived the
loads were immediately exploded usually
before the smoke from the passage of trains
had had time to clear from the tunnel quick-
ly following the shocks a car fitted with
a raised platform that permitted careful in-
spection of the roof and walls was pushed
into the tunnel by an engine which always
stood read-

  of all the jobs connected with the build-
ing of the cut there was none of a more
death-defying nature than that of the men
who manned the inspection car they went
in regardless of the smoke and being near
the roof got the full benefit of the accu-
mulated poison working under extreme
conditions such as most men could not stand
they invariably discovered all the larger
loosened rocks and removed them

  a strong search-light that pierced the
gloom aided in the work occasionally a rock
was picked off the track or from the roof
from which it would have been dislodged by
the first passing train each time it was as
if a wreck had been averted-and as all en-
gineers know a wreck in a tunnel is one of
the worst things that can happen on a rail-
road

  the emergency crew however could dis-
cover only the apparent faults caused by the
blasting although their ears aided them as
much as their eyes when tapping the roof
between blasting periods meanwhile there
were long stretches when the tunnel reverber-
ated with the passing of trains at such times
there was always the danger that a piece of
rock whose looseness could not be detected
would be dislodged by the jar and fall either
between trains or on top of one of them

keeping the tracks clear

  during the four years that the work was
in progress the fear of this danger never
ceased but there were other and even more
elaborate precautions to give warning the mo-
ment a piece of rock fell

extra track-walkers were hired and were
so thick in the tunnel that all could have


the railroad mans magazine

escaped injury only by a miracle in fact
four were killed but even at that they were
not thick enough to see every piece of rock
that fell and to aid them fine wires were
strung through the tunnel to give warning
each wire was part of an electric circuit
covering the roof for a few hundred feet and
even a small rock falling through it was rea-
sonably certain to strike a wire snap it in
two and break the circuit

  the moment the circuit was broken a red
light flashed at either end of the section it
covered the track-walker nearest seeing
the red light ran forward removed the ob-
struction and the trains passed through un-
touched the work was so thorough that only
one piece of rock hit a train and it weighed
but three pounds

  the cuts were not difficult from an en-
gineering standpoint except as they related
to the old tunnel but the four short tunnels
were a much harder problem to solve in
the cuts it made no difference how the rock
acted as the chief point was to blow it to
pieces but in the tunnels it was another mat-
ter because die tunnels are so wide

  the tunnels which resemble great via-
ducts were all started on die far side from
the old tunnel and once inside the drillers
worked much as they would have in mining
drifting and clearing out the rock above and
below them as they went they also tim-
bered except in the case of the second tun-
nel which was cut through one piece of rock
so solid that it was not necesssary to sup-
port the roof in any way until it was time
to lay the concrete

  among the engineers there was some dis-
pute as to whether this should have been
done but there appeared to be so little dan-
ger that those who were for speedier work
outvoted die more cautious ones and it so
happened that  one was hurt after the
concrete was all in place there was in the
case of each arch a free space of fifty-four
feet through which to run the four tracks and
allow space for the third rails to be used
when the road is electrified

when tony cried

   on the fourth tunnel however is the one
piece of unsuccessful work  the whole job
approaching it on foot from the east can
be seen a solid - wall of concrete fifty feet
high reaching from the top of the tunnel
arch to the street above it stands where all
can see above the other tunnels there are
jagged walls of rock but in this case the

smooodi surface of the concrete tells another
story at this point the rock did not hold i
asked moorshead about it and he ex-
plained

    in laying the concrete of the arches he
said  we knocked out the central pillars
we had left up to diat time and a small por-
tion was always unprotected while the con-
crete was setting in this case we proceeded
as usual but just above the last section on
this end of the tunnel was a mass of rock
ready to fall the moment the supports were
knocked out it hung like the inverted key
to an arch and the moment the supports
were gone it came down bringing part of
the street with it

   it gave us a few days warning and we
put the best man we had on the job an
italian we call tony but he couldnt save
it it was like calling in die doctor when
a patient is almost dead for all diat tony
could do it fell and when it came down he
cried

a human earth-worm

  this last statement was pretty strong we
had just been passing through crowds of
drillers and blasters at work  skinning
down  die surface of the cut and i had not
seen one who looked as if he might cry under
any circumstance they were hard men
used to cruelly hard work and human life to
them meant little to be told that one of
them was capable of weeping because a few
tons of rock came down was difficult to be-
lieve but moorshead stuck by his statement

   whats his real name i asked

  tony is all the name i know he re-
plied but i know he can handle powder
were coming to him now he is at the
other end of die cut doing one of the most
delicate pieces of work on die job

   presently we arrived at the point where the
old tunnel and the cut meet and right on a
sliver of rock between the two tony was at
work with his gang blowing away about a
hundred and fifty feet of it

  tony moorshead asked what is your
right name

  camillo campanna he replied and
then for the first time one of the most valu-
able workmen on the job was known by his
right name to any one connected with the
erie except perhaps some clerk in the
auditors office

  i looked at him closely but his face was
 more mobile than the rest yet he had
cried when part of the tunnel came down
the greatest railroad cut



   youve been at this work a long time
havent you asked moorshead

  yes replied tony with an eager look
in his face that betrayed the artist proud of
his work  i blew the pennsylvania tunnel
under tenth and eleventh avenues in new
york

   this is not the kind of artistic accomplish-
ment that usually goes by the name but to
tony these tunnels were the- children of his
genius

   his first big piece of work we also learned
was timbering the big hole that was made in
forty-second street at madison avenue in
front of the grand central station when the
subway was being built in new york this
was work that required great engineering
skill but tony whose technical knowledge
had all been obtained by actual experience in
the earth braced up the sides of the big
hole so successfully that the street traffic went
over it as usual and the big buildings on
both sides the grand central station and
the tall manhattan hotel stood undisturbed
while the rock was blown practically from
under them

  after such feats tony could hardly be
blamed for weeping when he saw an ex-
pensive accident that might have been avoid-
ed if he had been put on the job a day
earlier

humoring the commuters

  the work he was doing at this time was
very delicate if anything that deals in dyna-
mite can be so called the point of rock be-
tween the tunnel and the cut had to be blown
completely away and quickly at that but
traffic could not be disturbed either in the
tunnel or in the cut the blasts had to be
fired between trains with a leeway of only a
minute or two to clear the debris from the
track i saw some of this work going on
and it was exciting it took an artist like
tony to enter into the spirit of such an
undertaking and do it successfully

  the need for hurry again was due to the
commuters as there was so far only a
double-track in the cut and the trains on
the northern branches were still compelled to

use the tunnel their passengers seeing
the other trains using the cut were envious
and loudly and vociferously voiced their
complaint to station-agents conductors offi-
cials of the company and the newspapers
so that it was necessary to still their clamor

   at this time it was late in june and on the
first of july the new and higher rates were
to go into effect on most of the suburban
roads running out of new york there was a
good deal of kicking but the erie was sha-
ming its commuters into silence by exhibit-
ing the cut it had made for them this
however meant nothng to those who were
still going through the tunnel so to put them
in a happier frame of mind their trains had
to be run through the cut also before it was
time to buy the commutation tickets for july

cut used by six lines

  six big lines with many branches now run
through the new cut they are the main line
of the erie the new jersey and new york
railroad the northern railroad of new jer-
sey the new york and greenwood lake
its newark branch and the new york sus-
quehanna and western which formerly used
the jersey city terminal of the pennsylvania
railroad

   just west of the cut the six divisions con-
verge into three main stems during the
morning when the traffic is the heaviest to-
ward new york each main stem has a
track and all the outgoing traffic is handled
on the fourth track at night when the traf-
fic sets the other way the conditions are re-
versed at such times there is the novel
sight of three trains abreast swinging along
through the cut where formerly they crawled
singly in the darkness of the tunnel

  what impressed me more than the en-
gineering wonder was the personal attitude
of the men toward the gigantic task they had
performed as we walked along moors-
head turned to me suddenly and said

    i hate to see it finished its my child
and i cant bear the thought of it growing
up but its through with me now just as
any child grows away from the control of
its parent

getting the super to st louis

by f h richardson

              sandy mcguire tells of the time he fired
              the  for fatty burns and made a record

ay said long jim who fired the
   after the usual gathering
  in the roundhouse had finished
  rubbering at the board  any of
  you tallow-pots got wise to the
  little fairy at lexington lunch-
  counter yet  

  haw haw haw ask tompkins over
there replied engine s scoup-pusher
 he ordered a wedge of lemon pie last night
and she fetched him a plate of beans tommy
ate em every durnd one and never knew
the difference fact and when they got
ready to pull out the eagle eye had to go in
and snake him through the door by the slack
of his overalls or hed been there yet

  well retorted tompkins shes a pip-
pin all right all right and i-

  for heavens sake cut it out broke in
one of the extra men you fellers give me
a pain girls is all you can talk about
the whole bunch of you is blowing off steam
half the time about some pippin why
dont a few of you fellers couple up to some
of them

    nix on the wedding business replied the
steam-maker of the  nothing doing
look at bob over there looking like the
original grouch that come out of the ark
cause why thats easy he done the
matrimony stunt and now the pippin lies
tied to takes his check away from him every
pay-day and gives him back forty-five cents
-all for his very own to squander just ex-
actly as he pleases provided he dont spend
it foolish

  taint no such thing retorted bob
 they aint no woman runnin-

   the rest of his denial was lost in the laugh-
ter and guying that followed

  wellyou tallow-pots can throw all the
fits about that little yaller-haired shrimp of
a gal down at lexington you want to said

the fireman of the  when the noise had
subsided but lemme tell you the real
simon-pure plush-upholstered pulhnan pal-
ace-car of a gal is the one slinging hash and
foundry pies down at gaffneys shes
the-

   aw for the love of suffering grate-bars
will you chumps shut up some of these
times one of youll blow your dome-cap off
carrying such a tremendous pressure of love
for a piece of calico  interrupted sandy
mcguire who poked coal into the 
did ye hear about the run me and fatty
burns made last saturday

  naw replied the extra man  i reck-
on it want nothing startling at that fatty
couldnt get diat old tub of an engine going
moren twenty-five miles an hour to save his
neck 

  sandy eyed the speaker with withering con-
tempt

  couldnt hey well i reckon that
would be about right if you was firing her
he wouldnt have steam enough to pull his
own tank but they happened to be a real
man handling the scoup that day a fire-
man not a farmer-see  

   gwan old man  cried one of the crowd
who happened to owe sandy half a dollar
and wished to keep in his good graces until
he forgot it  give us the yarn 

  sandy glared at the extra man but as he
evinced symptoms of being squelched con-
tented himself with saying

   some folks always have to be tooting
their whistle whether theyve got a noise
worth making or not

   it was this way he began but stopped
to borrow a pipeful from long jim then
he filled his nose-warmer carefully cleaned
out the stem with a straw which he jerked
from the office broom and was puffing the
smoke skyward when he continued
getting the super to st louis



   the super got a hurry-up wire to come
to st louis and as both the day varnished-
car trains had gone he ordered out an engine
and coach to take him

   i dunno what it was all about but it
sure was some urgent for he come near giv-
ing the yardmaster the hostler and a few
others heart-failure gettin things ready for
the trip	i

  the caller come after me on the run
and i thought sure there must be an earth-
quake chasing him i never knew that fat
slob to move faster than a walk before the
experience was so unusual that he just set
down on my front steps with his tongue out
and panted like a dog when i got over
to the depot there was the old mill all ready
to start and fatty squirting oil onto things
like he owned an oil-well

   the hostler had the lire spread and
steam up the super was standing on the
edge of the platform watching for me and
begun to give hurry-up signals as soon as i
come in sight so i finished in a gallop

   say we went down through the yards-
well ill bet them old rails aint had such a
shaking up in years

  that old scrap-heap im firing can sure
split the landscape when you let her out
and ill say this for fatty burns-he aint
afraid to ride

   i actually believe if that man was strad-
dle of a streak of lightning hed be feeling
around for the throttle of the thing to open
it up a little more

   we made a bluff at stopping at the katy
crossing and come pretty near doing it any-
way we wasnt running moren forty miles
an hour when we went over the katy tracks

  fatty was just getting her going good
when the super come crawling over the top
of the tank into the cab and says to fatty

    what do you mean by running a cross-
ing like that 

  what crossing asks fatty so inno-
cent

  what crossing why the katy of
course 

  oh the katy well i didnt quite
stop mr haley but we went over it very
slowly says fatty without batting an eye

   the old man looked at him for a minute
and sorter grinned

   say says he finally  im in a mighty
big rush to get to st louis all right but i
dont want to be scraped up with a hoe and
carried there in a market-basket 

   all this time burns had her wide open
and we was ripping something of a hole in

the atmosphere when we nearly got to the
renick coal-chutes fatty asked how much
coal i needed i told him two tons i didnt
want to delay things trying to take all i could
and the tank was nearly half full already

   well we made a flying stop at the chutes
and fatty whistled for two tons and what
dye suppose that galvanized freak at the
chutes did

   made a mistake and stopped us at a
seven-ton bin

   say when i pulled that apron down i
thought sure id drawed a whole coal-mine
we had coal in the cab coal on the ground
and the chute apron buried under about three
tons of it

  was the super wild well i guess yes
he was in the cab and the two-legged curi-
osity up on top of the chutes couldnt see him
but he sure could hear what he said

   the chap  top who was responsible for
the blunder thought it was fatty doing the
talking and he come back at him real
prompt calling him something like seventeen
different names

   the super never stopped to think that the
feller didnt know it was him he just made
a flying leap for the ground and fired that
coal-heaver six times before he hit it

   when the feller above got a good look
and saw who it was hed been cussing he
fainted and fell in a coal-bin-and that was
the last we saw of him

   i noticed there was a new coal-heaver at
renick yesterday remarked one of the lis-
teners

  yep the old man fired him on the
spot and wired in a discharge at every place
we stopped all the way to st louis besides
diat he made us pull down and stop at die
renick depot after wed spent twenty min-
utes digging the chute-apron out of the coal
while lie told the agent to have that chap
arrested for trespass if he ever caught him-
within two hundred yards of the right-of-
way

  well as i said we finally got the apron
dug out and for the next ten miles we must
have paved the right-of-way with coal that
shook off the top of the tank

  one nice big chunk weighing about a
hundred pounds eloped just as we passed
die thompson depot going something under
a hundred miles an hour it fell on the plat-
form and busted into seven thousand pieces

  ill bet its raining coal around there
yet and what glass there was left in the
depot windows wouldnt fill a frame for a
postage-stamp


the railroad mans magazine

     at mexico we got orders to meet no  at
montgomery and the super remarked to fat-
ty that wed lay her out ten minutes the best
we could do

  we will was fattys comeback and
hanged if he didnt make good too

   say ive seen some running in my time
but from mexico to montgomery that day
was a star number burns hooked her up
in six inches and tried to pull the throttle
out by the roots he kept yankin at it till
i asked him if he didnt want me to take
the lever back and lay it on the rear platform
of th coach

  run i dont guess that old tub touched
the rails moren ten times in ten miles shed
heel over to one side and go back with a
slam that made the telegraph poles jump
the coal jolted down through the coal gate
until there was about a foot on the deck and
the dust was so thick you could have cut it
into chunks with an ax i kept her hot for
two miles by just opening the fire-box door
and letting the dust suck in 

   aw you couldnt a done that sandy
exclaimed a wiper who was standing in the
door

  couldnt hey now what do you know
about it you gangly-shanked greasy-waste
slinger go out and mop some of the grease
off one of them engines that aint been
really wiped in six months

  sandy lit his pipe again and continued

   once i made a dip to put in a scoop of
coal and landed the whole thing up in fat-
tys lap he just grinned and said  thats
all right sandy its the only place they
wasnt any

   honest i could imagine i heard that
coach crack like the snapper of a whip as
we went around the curves an all the time
fatty set up there on his box with that old
clay nose-warmer of his going like a volcano
as unconcerned as a kid in a perambulaor

  we didnt lay no  out a single minute
the old man came over when we stopped at
montgomery for orders and says to fatty
says he

    that was a great run all right burns
what do you think this train is anyhow a
telegram  

  from montgomery everything went all
right until we struck pendelton hill we
was going down it some slower than a wire-
less and shot around a curve near the foot of
the hill to see a dago sectionman standing
in the middle of the track waving a red flag
like he was tired but when he saw how
we was coming he woke up real sudden and

churned that red flag through the air so fast
he nearly set it afire

  fatty had put on the air as soon as he
saw the flag but when the dago got excited
burns yanked the sand-lever open and put
her over into the breeching

   say you fellers know what it means to
put an engine over when shes going some-
thing like seventy an hour its a wonder she
didnt strip herself

   between the airbrakes and the engine
we sure made a record stop it developed
afterward that the super was rubbering out
of the rear door of the coach when fatty put
her over the shack told me that he wasnt
sure whether the old man turned two somer-
saults or three but for about three seconds
he looked just like a pin-wheel

   of course this performance didnt have
a soothing effect on his temper and he wasnt
singing a comic song when he climbed down
out of the car to ask that sectionman what
was the trouble

    what the blue blazes is the matter
here he yelled as he hit the ground

  the dago saw who it was and jerking
off his headgear began bowing like a jump-
ing-jack

    maka da rail in said he by way of
information

  whats that sputtered the super

  maka da rail in da track submitted
the son of italy

    he means theyre putting in a new
rail says fatty wliod just got done looking
over the rods and pistons to see if the terrific
plugging shed got had done any damage

    suppose they have a mile pulled up
ahead

   the super climbed on the pilot and told
fatty to pull down to where the gang was
working- around a curve and sure enough
they had two rails out

  the old man was so mad when he saw
it he couldnt wait but jumped off the pilot
and run on ahead

  whos boss here he yelled

  a big chap with a smoky-looking face
stepped out removed his cap and made his
best bow

    what do you mean by having the track
tore up this way  inquired the super

    maka da rail in replied the general
manager of the gang

  youre fired shouted the old man
 the whole bunch of you now get those
rails in quickern you ever did anything else
in your life-you hear me 

   he boss looked at the super and never
getting the super to st louis



said a word then he said something to
the men in his own lingo and every one of
them threw down his shovel and put on his
coat

   what are you freaks doin   yelled the
super

  you say you maka da lire replied the
boss  all right we go da home 

   you what  said the super

    you say you maka da fire da whole
bunch what for we maka da work when
you maka da fire  continued the boss

  plainly the old man didnt quite catch
the point so fatty stuck in his oar again

   he means that since youve fired them
they wont do any more work he said

   it didnt require the wisdom of no solo-
mon to recognize the fact that with those
two rails out and the old man on a hurry-up
to st louis tlie dagoes had him where the
hair was short he seen the point too real
sudden and come off his high perch though
it was plain he was near the busting point

 oh come now he said to die boss  i
was only joking get busy now and get
those rails in in a hurry 

   you no maka da fire  asked the boss
 of course not come on now get a
double-twisted push on for youre laying us
out and every minute counts 

  what he intended to do to that bunch
once the rails were in wouldnt be hard to
guess-but the dago wasnt born yesterday

   all right said the boss  you ne maka
da fire now we quit 

   at this piece of information the old man
jus sorter exploded he called them guineas
-everything but their right names i
actually thought hed pull out one of the
spikes an eat it he was so mad he charged

up and down the track till it looked like a
farmer had been plowing it but it didnt do
any good for them apostles of labor just sat
down on the bank and let him rave till he
was done

  and you couldnt guess in a thousand
years what they made him do before they
put them rails in

  they actually made him cough up five
dollars to every one of em and promise that
he wouldnt fire a single man of the bunch 

  he didnt stand for all that did he
asked long jim

   he certainly did if he hadnt i reckon
wed been there yet

   i lost some of the fun though for i got
down behind the boiler-head out of sight
and nearly bust all the buttons off my clothes
laughing fatty stayed down with the super
but his face was the color of a boiled lobster
and i could see him shaking widi bottled-
up laugh he had to keep his face sober as
a deacons honest if hed even smiled i
believe the old man would a brained him
with a spike maul

   the super kept his word with the dagoes
though tie didnt fire one of em

  he had the roadmaster do it theres
several ways of skinning a rabbit ive ob-
served 

   well we finally got by that mixup-and
talk about running the track was clear for
us and we never even slowed up for fer-
guson junction ill bet th dust aint all
settled around there yet

  we didnt have no more trouble and
i reckon its a good thing we didnt the
super had about all that one ordinary man
is calculated to stand in one day without
bustin his boiler entirely

a trolley-cars long trip

across five states and return a distance
of over one thousand nine hundred and
ninety-four miles is a trip which few trolley-cars
can boast of having made but such was the actual
run accomplished -by one of the regular cars of
the oneida railway company of utica recently
which traveled from utica to louisville ken-
tucky and back in fourteen days

  the car kept to its schedule of thirty-eight miles
an hour throughout the trip and not a single
mishap marred the long journey which officials of
the oneida railroad and citizens of utica par-
ticipated in to learn something of the railway de-
velopment of the central states

   the cities of detroit indianapolis ft wayne
toledo buffalo and syracuse were all passed

through on the long journey and the lines of
twenty-six distinct electric corporations were
passed over in making the trip

  at one place where no connection existed it
was necessary for one road to lay a temporary track
over to the other to allow the car with its pas-
sengers to be transferred to the other line over
all but four miles of track the car traveled under
its own power that distance it was towed owing
to a difference in voltage

  the car was the regular type equipped with four
seventy-five horse-motors and the trucks were
fitted with three-inch flanges while the inside of
the car was fitted with wicker seats instead of the
regular seats used in the ordinary passenger serv-
ice-popular electricity

chapter x

in paradise

he next morning i was released
 from my temporary prison
 where i must admit i enjoyed
 one of the most peaceful nights
 that had befallen me since i set
 out on my adventurous career

 several times during the afternoon and
evening my swarthy keeper brought me fruits
a plenty and cooked meat baked breadfruit
-a most delicious substitute for bread or

potatoes-and a dozen or more cool young
coconuts

  these he showed me how to open when-
ever i might be thirsty they are the staple
and ever-ready drink of the isles of the trop-
ical zoneg no matter how hot the day how
blazing the sun these well-filled cisterns of
nature are ready for the parched and their
liquid interiors are always as cool as if iced

  my keeper seemed to be of the kind-heart-
ed sort he could not speak english but
by signs we managed to make each other un-
derstood he wanted me to eat and drink
and be comfortable-and so i had no fear

the man who wasnt game



  when he went for the night i ate and
drank to my hearts content at length the
light that at first came streaming through the
little window near the thatched ceiling began
to grow dimmer and soon it faded into dark-
ness

  then there was nothing left for me to do
but recline on the mat on the floor and lay
my head on the pillow of weeds

  i used to think that the old bed of my
boyhood home was soft and comfortable but
this was indeed the most restful couch on
which i had ever placed my body it may
have been that i was exhausted but that
tropical bed was like one of the couches that
we read about in the  arabian nights

  when i awoke it was broad daylight i
stretched myself rubbed my eyes and looked
about me for a few moments

  as if by magic the bolt on the door
clanged and my keeper entered and greeted
me with a hearty good morning

  he beckoned and i followed him outside
and down the pathway to a swiftly powing
stream some twenty yards to the rear of the
house in which i had been imprisoned

  he stood on the bank for a moment
then stripping himself entirely of his scant
clothing signaled me to do likewise

  while i hesitated he plunged into the
water in a well-poised dive i could see his
bronzed body as he swam under water dart-
ing swiftly ahead by the wonderfully artistic
strokes of the island swimmer

  he came to the surface nd smiled in a
moment i had thrown off my clothing and
had made a dive into the cooling stream i
splashed and plunged i darted and i dived
again-and the water acted like a tonic for
my blood was soon tingling through my veins

  in fifteen minutes or so he signaled that our
morning bath was to come to an end we
emerged from the water and dried our bodies
in the sun when i had dressed my kindly
keeper took me by the hand and muttering
some native words led me back up the path
and onto what appeared to be the main road

  this road was lined with great tall trees
not unlike the elms of our own new england
in shape and leaf save that they were cov-
ered with gigantic scarlet blossoms which
mingling with the bright green of the leaves
made one of the most glorious pictures that
nature had ever created

  these great trees formed a natural arch
over the road shutting out the hot rays of
the tropical sun and keeping it cool and in-
viting they arched so high that as we
walked along i was unusually impressed

with the largeness of the things that grow in
the soil and the smallness of man

  we plodded along for a mile or more
through a beautiful country there were fer-
tile valleys all about it seemed in which all
manner of wonderfully flowering plants
were blossoming amid what seemed to me
to be well-kept plantations

  here and there were the low coconut-
thatched dwellings of the natives to the
right rose the peaks of the mountains until
they were completely lost in the clouds and
on the left the bluest ocean i had ever seen
rested without a ripple as the sun glinted
over its surface

  what a beautiful place in which to live i
thought

  we must have gone some distance beyond
a mile when my guide and keeper turned off
the main road and into another more narrow
and shorter that soon led to a gate

  this gate opened onto a garden of myriad
flowers strange and fragrant along the
pebbled path we walked and finally stopped
before a native house thatched with the ever-
useful coconut palms in style and finish per-
haps a little more impressive than any other
i had seen that morning

  one step led from the ground to the ve-
randa as my keeper put his foot thereon
the latticed door was opened by a beautiful
young girl-as charming and soulful a crea-
ture as ever my eyes looked on and she had
come out to greet us

  and greet us she surely did as she smiled
she showed the whitest of snow-white teeth
and her eyes lit up with a great wonderment
she held out her hand as she came toward
me i looked at my keeper who had re-
moved his hat and was standing in an atti-
tude of the most abject obeisance

  instinctively i took her hand and returned
her greeting she directed the way into the
house i entered and she followed he
who had been my custodian since i was
thrown on these shores of wonder bowed as
if he had received his full reward for being
a willing servitor and went his way

  to nly surprise she spoke a broken eng-
lish it was very  broken and she spoke
it very slowly and with great effort-but i
could understand her and it was not much
trouble to make her understand me

  she was very pretty her skin was a
most delicate brown her eyes were piercing
black large and luminous and her white
teeth her long black hair and her finely cut
cameo features at once attracted my atten-
tion when she stood on lier bare feet and


the railroad mans magazine

 drew her loose-fitting gown around her i
 noticed that like rosalind she was just as
 high as my heart

    she called in the most silvery tones and
 two maid servants entered she gave orders
 which i could not understand and they dis-
 appeared

   i was sitting on a wicker-seat and she
 drew another close to mine then she asked
 me my name and all about me and my ad-
 - ventures and just how i happened to be
 cast up on die island of moona-for that was
 just where i happened to be at that particular
 moment

    i told her as briefly as possible just what
 i had been through and she listened with all
 the eagerness of a child

   then i ventured to ask her name and she
 replied tati with a long sound of the
  a which gave it a peculiarly pleasant mu-
 sical tone

    she explained that she was more than tati
 indeed she was the princess tati and her
 father the old king of moona lived afar on
 the other side of the island where he was
 maintained in limited luxury by the euro-
 pean government which had once overpow-
 ered him and was now slowly turning the
 utopia that his forefathers had created and
 handed down to him into the commercial
 status of modern civilization

   tati was telling me that this was her
 house that her grounds were outside and all
 that nature brought forth thereon was hers
 and hers alone frequently she went to visit
 her father and mother and sisters and fre-
 quently they came to visit her she loved
 her island home she said and cared little
 for the great lands that lay beyond its shores
 and if all the men were like the officers of
 the regiments that policed the island-who
 never failed to insult her-then she was glad
 she was a daughter of the tropics

    while she chatted on telling all about her
 island and the people the maid servants en-
 tered with a tray of food and spread it on a
 cloth of green leaves which they laid on the
 floor these islanders never dined from
 tables

   there was a great dish of wild grapes
 there was an omelet sprayed with some savory
 sauce there was breadfruit in several forms
 there were tiny fishes and there were two
 bowls of the most savory coffee that i ever
 drank

    she sat on the floor in the posture known
 on our land as tailor fashion and bade
 me do likewise i couldnt take the position
 as easily as she did but i managed to make

myself comfortable and she pointed to my
bowl of coffee and bade me taste it

    it is delicious i told her

  now try a fish she said always smi-
ling

  she looked at me queerly as i lifted a
morsel of the food to my mouth it tasted
unlike any fish that i had ever eaten

   you dont like it she said

  i was trying to decide whether i did or
not when she continued

    it is raw fish it is the dish that we like
best in moona-land

   the fish tasted better i must admit than
the idea of devouring it before it had been
put through the recipe of a chef but tati
ate it relishingly and explained as she did
so that her people never cooked fish that the
waters of the sea were so pure and the fish
so fine they were preferred raw a sauce of
lemon and grated coconut added to their fla-
vor and destroyed the taste of oil in the finny
ones flesh

  before the breakfast had gone further i
found myself reaching for another fish and
tati beamed on me as i did so

  she was my friend that was plain and
realizing that it was my turn toask her some
questions

  princess tati i said wont you tell
me why i was locked up last night

  were you rot comfortable she asked
in return

   quite i replied  but i must admit
that at first i was a bit frightened i didnt
know where i was

   werent you comfortable and didnt you
have a nice dinner

   i was very comfortable i said  i
never slept better in all my life and the
dinner was splendid

  she looked at me coyly then she went on
   i sent you the dinner and-

   i interrupted her with a burst of thanks
 i had you locked up she continued
she hid her face and her laughter was like
the tinkling of bells

  it would have taken a hard-hearted wretch
to have turned in anger on so beautiful a
creature even though she had made him a
prisoner that laughter would have dis-
pelled any wrath

  tell me all about it i said laughing
too  i am interested

   well ill tell you we of the royal fam-
ily of moona have an old custom which the
government that now rules us has never taken
away it is this the princesses can lay
claim to any strange man who comes to these
the man who wasnt game



shores just as the princes can lay claim to
the other sex

  she looked at me wondering if i under-
stood and you my reader must remember
that if i quote her in more perfect english
than she really spoke it is only to make
plainer the wonderful simplicity and poetry
of her thoughts

   i heard the commotion when you were on
the reef and i ran down to the beach i
asked one of my servants to take some men
in a canoe and bring you ashore at first
i thought that you were some enemy but
when you stepped on our beach i could see
by your face that you were a friend

  i blushed and tati blushed too

   i told my servant that i wanted you to
visit me-oh it has been a long time since
a stranger has come here and we could put
our old custom in vogue and as it was im-
possible for me to see you then i told him to
lock you in a little house that i own down
near the beach and keep you there until
morning

   but why did you lock me in   i asked

   i was afraid you would get away she
answered with the artless look of one who
has given a very good reason for having
done something that is very foolish

   i wouldnt have left here for days i
said

   and you wont leave for days now will
you   she asked rather appealingly

  i did not reply at first i just sat and
looked at this captivating creature - this
child of a sunlit isle in a sunlit sea who was
more beautiful than any other girl in all the
world

  i sat and looked at tati and a great power
seemed centered in her face her eyes shone
with a wondrous luster her lips parted-
now they were playful and now profound
her whole body was as languorous and sup-
ple as an orientals and she seemed to pos-
sess a personal magnetism that was more
than i could reist

  here was a temptress

  who would have dreamed that i the pro-
saic john anderson soldier of fortune from
far-away america would be cast on a trop-
ical isle and be seated in the presence of the
princess

  i had heard of such romances in a vague
way i had read of them in books and had
discarded them as mere playthings to cheer a
tired brain i had been told of a fairy-land
and all that was mystic and believed it not
-but here i was-homeless and penniless-
ten thousand miles from the prairie and a

princess was actually talking to me-and-
tearing my heart out by the roots

chapter xi

our talk in the arbor

che stood up and placed her hands be-
 hind her and moved - i cannot say
walked-with the noiseless gliding motion
of her kind to the veranda

  i arose and followed she led the way
down the path and through the flowers to a
blossom-bedecked arbor

   i will stay on this island i said to
myself as i followed her  i will stay and
i will be her friend and maybe more and
why not am i not four and twenty and
fair and strong am i not free to go whither
i please does she not show by her look
and word that she is interested in me  

  tati sat down and i sat beside her i
always said  princess but now i asked
that she give me permission to call her by
her first name

   surely she replied  and i will call
you merita tanoa that she went on to ex-
plain  is our native language for  american
man and i am going to call you by that
name

  so in our future talks i was ever merita
tanoa though tati frequently cut it short by
simply saying merita

  i asked her age i asked about her life i
asked for every bit of information that she
could tell about her interesting self she told
me everything and she told me too that she
had never been in love and she wondered if
there were any one who would make her love
as she wanted to love

  it might have been a confession on her
part that she cared for me be that as it was
destined to be-i knew that i loved her with
all my heart

  tati i said perhaps some one has
come along who can make you love-but i
cannot swear i do know that some one has
come along who loves you with all his heart

  i drew nearer to her and took her hand
her soft fingers closed on mine - i knew
then that she would not refuse to hear me i
put my arm about her shoulders and drew her
closer and closer her body thrilled her
arm sought my neck her great eyes beamed
with love and her lips trembled

   i kissed her

  she nestled close and whispered  my
merita

  i kissed her again


the railroad mans magazine

   will you stay here always she asked

   i shall be glad to i replied looking
down at my tattered clothes still bearing the
grease and grime of the molly o malone
which even the waters of the sea had been
unable to eradicate

   but what shall i do for clothes

    you shall dress like a native-and live
like a native she went on  i will give
you some of our mens clothing it is far
more comfortable than your clothing and
you will soon get used to it and like it

    oh you are so good  i told her  but
what shall i do for food  and i must work
so that i can get money to live

  tati laughed the natives of moona had
but little regard for work and why should
one want to work i thought when the land
gives him food without tilling and the sea



and all else adds -to his supply of visible
wants 

    you will live here tati went on di-
recting my future as she pleased and we
will go to my father some day soon and he
will give you a plantation if-if-

   she was hesitating she came closer her
head was on my breast and she trembled

  i put my arm around her to comfort her
and bent tenderly over her

    if what  i asked

   if- she hesitated again  oh cant
you guess

   indeed i tried to guess a dozen different
things ran riot through my brain finally
she looked up into my eyes her fear had
gone

    if you marry me she said and hid her
face again

   then the plantation is mine i an-
swered

   she reserved a part of her house for me
her servants put it in the best order and laid
on the floor the best mat she possessed and
placed thereon the very best willow-rest for
my head

   that night when i stretched out for rest

	went over the days happenings to the
minutest detail i wanted to be sure that i
had not made a prime fool of myself i
wanted to be sure that it were best to stay on
that beautiful isle where all was peace and
plenty and i wanted to be sure that my lot
lay there and not aboard some vessel that
would carry me to more practical shores

   while i was thus musing i fell asleep in
the morning i was awakened by a rustling at
my side and there stood my old friend the
native who had so carefully locked me up the
first night of my  arrival

  i shall always refer to him as my keep-
er and although he told me that his name
was akipo i generally said keep when-
ever i spoke to him

  well akipo bore the glad tidings of his
august mistress and several pieces of cloth
the latter i soon learned were a small white
shirt common to all lands and a square of
colored print about four feet each way

  this akipo explained by many a ges-
ture was the native garment and that i was
to wear it he was dressed in the regula-
tion way he showed me and i examined his
clothes and prepared to dress likewise

   the shirt was very easy to get into it is
worn the same way the world over-but the
four feet square of print was something quite
new

  akipo took his off and put it on several
times to instruct me the scheme was to
simply wrap it around the waist and tuck the
edges into some sort of an impossible knot
that would stay put until die wearer was
ready to retire for the night

  once fastened the cloth hung from the
waist after the manner of a skirt i realized
at once that it was a very comfortable form
of dress for tropical wear and it seemed to
match my complexion and fill other phases of
importance but-i simply could not manage
to tie that wonderful knot

  whenever i donned the cloth and knotted
it about my waist and walked about the
room it would come untied akipo patiently
adjusted his a dozen times with the most
marvelous dexterity he showed me that
that famous knot could not come undone if
it were only fastened properly-and i be-
lieved him

  it took skill and endurance however i
finally mastered it and of all the surprises
that have come to me since the day i swam
ashore on this tropical isle that knot was
the most mysterious and the most wonderful

  breakfast was almost ready and akipo
made the knot for me i was sure of it when
he did the work and when i appeared before
the princess in my new garb i feared no
unseemly mishap

  tati had the feast of the morning spread
on leaves that she plucked herself from a
shrub in the garden

  there was the raw fish and the fruit and
the coffee and this morning in order to toast
ourselves and our future she had made the
daintiest beverage of coconut water and
limes and the essence of an herb that grew
in her garden

  she poured it into a coconut-shell and
the man who wasnt game



wished me every joy as she drank she
handed the rustic goblet to me and i wished
the same as i quaffed to the depths then
we drank again it was a harmless beverage
there was no stimulant mixed in it to fire
the brain and set the wits awry-it was a
wholesome liquor and as pure as the brook
but it had the tang of the earth and the snap
of a whip

  after our breakfast we went again to the
little arbor where the day before i had held
my princess in my arms within its cooling
shade we talked again of our love and our
future and we planned that we should visit
the father immediately and convey to him
the good news

   and he will give us his blessing said
tati i know that he will be very very
happy

  i wanted to see something of the island
and tati suggested that akipo take me
around in a carriage which she would sup-
ply for the purpose

  she sent him off and we strolled about her
grounds-a riot of roses and a sea of color-
and she told me how dear it was to her for
it was her very own home and not even the
foreign government which ruled over the
island could take it from her she was chat-
ting about each and every spot in her para-
dise when akipo returned

  he hailed us from outside the gate he
sat on the front seat of the most dilapidated
conveyance that i had ever seen it was
once a victoria the horse that was hitched
to it was no better he was so poor and thin
that i was really ashamed to have him exert
his-strength by dragging me along the high-
way

  but tati explained that this rig was once
the conveyance of the british consul who had
sold it to her for a nominal sum when his
government had given him something better

   it is the best that we have on the island
explained tati you see we dont ride
much here most of our traveling is done
by water and on land we prefer to walk
but foya is stronger than he looks she
went up to the horse and patted his neck he
neighed as if he wanted to convey the same
impression

  i asked tati to accompany me but she
wanted to remain and prepare for the trip to
her fathers so i jumped in and akipo
clicked to the horse we were off at a leis-
urely jog

  i turned to my princess and threw her a
kiss and she direw a dozen in return as i
journeyed down the road i could see her in

the garden she was the acme of happi-
ness

  what i saw of moona that day made me
want to stay for all time it was beautiful
beyond description no pen can ever com-
pletely picture its tropical splendor no brush
can depict its natural glories it must be
seen to be appreciated

  everywhere the inhabitants were idling in
the shade of their eternally leafy trees
everywhere little children ran gleefully as
naked as the day they were born every-
where beautiful girls and stalwart men
passed along with peace and contentment on
their faces everywhere there was plenty
and sunshine and the glory of a contented
life

  no one seemed to worry if there was
trouble in that blissful place it was afraid to
show its head

  the fascination was supreme the grip-
ping force of its wonder held me with chains
of steel i would stay

  akipo could only point with pride but
when we drove up to the little village where
the ships were at anchor in the harbor and
the populace was more thickly centered he
stopped at the door of a small cottage

  sitting on the front steps was a middle-
aged squat individual whom i quickly rec-
ognized as one of my own countrymen

  just why akipo stopped there i cannot tell
i was sorry that he had done so for the look
on the mans face was anything but pleas-
ant-in fact he was the only fly in the other-
wise clear amber of that paradise

  perhaps akipo did it from a sense of kind-
ness believing that i was anxious to meet
some one who could speak my tongue

  the stranger looked at me sullenly

  i greeted him cheerilv saying simply
how do you do

  he did not reply then i said

   i am sorry to have disturbed you and
i tried to motion akipo to move on

  akipo evidently did not understand then
the stranger glared at me more and more
fiercely and said

   how did you get here  

   did not like his tone there was fright
and fear in his face

   if you must know i may tell you i
replied but you seem to resent my pres-
ence so i will move on

  i nudged akipo but still he did not under-
stand my new-found friend arose from his
seat and came to the carriage

   what are you doing here and where did
you come from   he asked again


the railroad mans magazine

 well if you must know i swam ashore
 i originally came from the united states of
 america but by such a roundabout way that
 it would take weeks to tell you are you
 satisfied now

  then-then you are not a detective  he
 gasped

 no i replied most certainly i am
 not

 he breathed a sigh of relief and held out
 his hand

  thank heaven for that  he exclaimed
 do get out and come in-let me give you
 some refreshment

 he took my hand and pressed it warmly

 i hesitated but he insisted

 do-please do come in and talk to me

fr a little while it will be a godsend if you
will please oh please do  he pleaded
and the tears came to his eyes

   i have not spoken to a soul in english
for so many years and you are the first man
from gods country that i have seen in a
generation oh do come in and talk to me
my friend have mercy on me and stay a
little while 

  the tears were pouring down his cheeks
his pleading and his predicament were more
than i could stand

  i stepped out of the carriage and followed
him into his humble home

  what new sensation is in store for me
now i said to myself as i passed his

a new device for catching mail

clerks on illinois central trains can now gather in two bags instead

 of one

anew mail-catching device which not only
delivers maii-bags to fast-moving trains
and receives them as well handling two or more
bags as easily as one is being installed on the
freeport division of the illinois central railroad

  the unique feature of the catching device is
the buggy steel chain nets which operate in the
following manner attached to the outside of the
mail-car is a square steel frame to which the chain
net is attached

  this frame is made to swing on the hinges at-
tached to sliding bars so as to permit the device
to be quickly shifted from one side of the car
door to the other according to the direction in
which the car is moving

  attached to the lower outside comer of the
frame is one end of an iron rod with the other
end traveling on a bar attached to the car side

containing a set of spiral spiings so adjusted as to
bear by compression the shock resulting from the
frame and net catching the mail-bag

  on the same outside corner of the frame below
where the rod is attached is a hook or finger for
the attachment of the bags to be delivered

  the roodside device which acts in conjunction
with the one attached to the side of the car is
similar in all respects except that the bags it de-
livers to the train are hung above the receiving net
while with the car device the bags hang below the
net

  the devices meet as the train rushes past and
the exchange is made the force of the impact being
absorbed by the slack of the chain net and the
spiral springs the reflex action of the springs
throws the frames and the chain nets back with
the maii-bags surrounded by the nets-dixon star

railroading in japan

the trains used in japan are built on the
english model the engines being much small-
er than those with which we are familiar and
they are run on narrow-gaged tracks

  the coaches are divided into sections sleeping-
cars and diners have lately been introduced the
sleeping-cars prove uncomfortable to americans on
account of the diminutiveness of the berths as
they are built for a small people and those ex-
ceeding the size find sitting up more comfortable

  the diner has not proved a great success as
most of the trains stop from twenty to thirty min-
utes for meals natives meet the trains and sell
to the traveler a small box of lunch for the sum

of ten cents the lower layer of each box is of
rice and on top of that are vegetables hard-boiled
eggs and fruit the whole is wrapped in a large
green leaf and placed in the box hot saki beer
and tea may also be bought

  the guards of the train wear a blue uniform
and are active quick and courteous

  the fuel is mostly wood although some coal is
burned owing to the size of the engine the speed
of the train is not great thirty miles an hour
being the average time the longest run in
japan is from tokyo to maji a distance of three
hundred miles it takes two days and-a night to
cover the distance-chicago tribune
 the finish at frazers

by arthur a greene

the true story series men already in the shadow of the
gallows are not apt to hesitate about adding a few more notches to their
guns when they are cornered serving as a deputy peace officer often
proves quite as hair-raising an occupation as thawing dynamite or chumming
with a rattlesnake

    situations often arise where it is a case of kill or get killed and it is not
to be wondered at if most deputy-sheriffs feel inclined to choose the former rather
than the latter course the experiences of the young lawyer who was sworn in
to hunt down the hugo hold-up men and was in at the death of the two un-
known train-robbers surrounded at frasers ranch is a tale of rapid rifle-play
and of a bold strategy that came nearly causing the death of its author

true story number forty-nine

bullets proved of little avail but sheriff billy walker brought his former
baseball training into play with fatal results to
the train-robbers

vor ten years i have frequently
wondered who we killed
that day at frazers ranch
if anybody who sees this
should happen to know the
name of the men who held
up union pacific train no  on the night
of august   he will do me a favor
and clear up a mystery

   im sure that various peace officers out
west would like this information also for
train-robbery is a crime against which the
statute of limitations doesnt run and theres
still s in rewards outstanding

   my personal opinion has always been that

the men belonged to  butch  cassidys out-
fit and that the redoubtable  butch  him-
self directed the hugo hold-up and escaped
with his skin that worthy still flourishes
and seems permanently secure in his strong-
hold up in the routt country just belpw the
wyoming line and he still fares fortli and
turns an occasional trick

  the west end averaged about one hold-
up a month somewhere between pocatello
and salina and the company was at its wits
end for some means of breaking up the op-
erations of the gang which had its rendezvous
in the wilds of northern colorado

  big rewards were posted a big secret-

theres still  in rewards
outstanding

service force maintained and sheriffs all
along the line were keen on die watch the
robbers however always made their getaway

  i was practising law and economy at col-
by a little cow - town in western kansas
forty miles north of the union pacific and
some ninety miles northeast of hugo i
was young enough to be looking for trouble
and when two days after news of the robbery
had reached billy walker the sheriff who
swore me in as a deputy i was game for any-
thing

  my law office was across the street from
walkers livery stable the nervy sheriff
and i were chums in a way so when he
came into my dingy little quarters and in
his deliberate way told me that he needed
me in his business i was ready on the in-
stant

  one of frazers men just brought me
word that the fellers who stuck up no  are
rounded up at the ranch im goin to take
you and some more of the boys out and git
em well start in ten minutes theres
a horse across at the bam for you

   frazers was some fifteen miles from town
it was a ranch known over four counties
for its hospitality toward wayfaring cow-
men who happened to be in its vicinity the
messenger who had just ridden in brought
word that two exhausted men their horses
quite beat out had arrived at the ranch
early in the morning and demanded some-
thing to eat feed for their horses and a place
to sleep for a few hours

  there had been no one at home excepting

the women folk old frazer and the hands
were away working cattle in the breaks of
the smoky hill

  with ill-advised bravado they proceeded
to terrorize the women by tellings them that
they were the men who had held up the
train at hugo that they wanted to take turns
sleeping and that the man on watch would
shoot any one who attempted to leave or en-
ter the house on the other hand if they
were not molested and mrs frazer and her
two daughters made no effort to report their
presence they would be on their way as soon
as night came and no harm would be done

  they had not counted on their exhaustion
however and after a hearty breakfast one
of them lay on a bed with his chaps and
gums on and his rifle at his side he fell
asleep almost at once while his confederate
sat with his back to the wall his rifle across
his knee where he could command the situ-
ation in case of a show of hostility

  thirty-six hours in the saddle and no
sleep is going some however and soon the
women who had gone about their house-
hold tasks with an eye on their unbidden
iuests noticed that the watchman nodded
and presently his heavy breathing told that
he too was asleep

  it needed no ghost to come from the grave
to tell these western women it was time to
hike with the news after assuring them-
selves that the men really were sound asleep
they slipped out-of-doors and ran toward
the big road which led to the nearest neigh-
bors four miles away
the finish at frazers



  a mile from the house they met one of
their own  punchers  returning to the home
ranch for some branding-irons although
he had ridden far and his horse was tired
he faced toward town and brought word to
walker

  it was just at the beginning of the beef
round-up and the home ranches were prac-
tically deserted the men all being out on the
open range to the south so it happened
that when our little posse from colby ar-
rived on the scene we were the only men in
twenty townships

  the frazer ranch-house was the familiar
soddv still common on the plains-a low
one-story rectangular affair with few win-
dows and a front and back door

  the walls were made of squares of buf-
falo-grass sod and the roof of pine boards
warped and checked by the blazing sun of
that cloudless rainless land it stood three
hundred yards from the corrals and stable
on the top of a small knoll conspicuous in
that limitless sweep of treeless prairie

  we had ridden as hard as our tough little
broncoes could go and covered the fifteen
miles from town in less than two hours

  if our quarry had made the fatal mistake

earlier in the day of yielding to the demands
of their exhausted bodies they were suffici-
ently awake and alert when we arrived on the
scene we reined up at a point which we
thought well out of rifle range there were
eight of us including billy walker who is
the coolest man in the face of trouble ive
ever seen

  we hitched our horses in the barn not how-
ever until the reception committee in the
house had kicked up the dust around us with
their rifles to let us know they were on the
job and had plenty of ammunition

  whenever i hear a man boasting that he
doesnt mind being shot at as i have heard
men boast i set him down as a prime pre-
varicator for believe me that peculiar
 splutt -a sound which only a bullet stri-
king soft earth can make-is calculated to
give one some discomfort

  i was mighty glad to get down on my
stomach in the grass

  walker stood up long enough however to
shout to the men in the house who we were
and what we wanted he ordered them to
walk out in front of the house put their
guns on the ground and their hands up over
their heads he guaranteed that they would

with ill-advised bravado they proceeded to terrorize the women


the railroad mans magazine

be put safely into jail and have a fair trial
they shouted back something which we
didnt hear in the noise of the fusillade which
accompanied their answer we didnt know
then that they had killed a man in the hold-
up and were surprised that they wouldnt
listen to reason

  train-robberv only meant twenty years at
the most in those days but with a murder
charge against them it was not surprising
that they were desperate

  we deployed around the house returning
the fire which we directed at the windows
and doors in the chance of picking them off

  by this time it was noon and the sun was
blazing hot heat waves danced across the
gray baked prairie and grotesque mirage
shapes played tricks on the horizon we
had exchanged enough shots for a good-sized
battle but were far from results two more
of our men were hit one of them so badly
that they would have taken him back to town
for treatment but the men in the house
seemed no nearer surrender than they had
hours before

  if we had pinked either of diem it
wasnt apparent for hpth seemed keen for
trouble and at intervals kept up fire wv

although we seldom caught a glimpse of
them through the smoke

  every time one of us ventured a little too
close drawing himself along inch by inch
flat to the ground he attracted their fire and
found tilings mighty interesting jim don-
elam was hit in the shoulder during the first
hour he was wounded but he stuck and
wouldnt think of going back to town mean-
while the news had gone abroad and we
were reenforced by a half-dozen men with a
taste for excitement

hoped they would exhaust their ammunition
or get discouraged and surrender they evi-
dently believed that they could hold out until
it grew dark and then make a dash for lib-
erty it was a long chance but they decided
to take it

  the affair had taken on something of the
semblance of a show the whole county
apparently had turned out to see the scrap
keeping a safe distance well out of range on
the outskirts was a ring of wagons and buck-
boards filled with excited women and chil-

he reached a point where he could toss a blazing
ball on the roof
the finish at frazers



he stopped short and filled his rifle



drcn and an occasional timid man to keep
them company

  the afternoon was half gone when walker
called my attention to a depression barely a
foot deep which ran within sixty yards of
the house he had sent back to town for a
quantity of waste used by the engine-wipers
at the roundhouse he was going to roll it
into wads the size of a baseball crawl up the
swale close to the house and after touching
a match to the waste toss a blazing ball on
the roof of the house

  weve got em good and tight but they
may stand us off for a week for theyve got
grub and water in the house said walker
theres no use prolongin the agony so im
going to burn em out you fallows keep
popping away so as to keep them busy with
their knitting and ill do the sneak up the
draw

  it was a risky operation when it came
to throwing the fiery balls walker stood up
and exposed himself almost at pointblank
range but that didnt stump him for a
minute although to this day as a result of
his gameness he limps

  the man finally arrived with the waste

    r r

after giving the besieged another chance to
surrender which was answered by a- volley
bill walker started on his perilous crawl up
the shallow swale with half a dozen balls of
waste in the front of his flannel shirt the
rest of us covered his slow progress with a
fusillade which did not lull for an instant
our stock of ammunition had been replen-
ished fortunately for we had been pretty
liberal with it

  we kept one eye on walker who was ma-
king remarkably good progress along the five
hundred yards he had to cover before he
reached a point where he could toss a blazing
ball onto the tinder-dry roof

  fortunately the men at bay didnt discov-
er what was going on until the tall form of
the big sheriff loomed up within easy revolver
range of the house i stopped shooting
spellbound by the finest exhibition of nerve
ive ever seen in my life

  walker struck a match on the leg of his
trousers the wad of waste blazed for an
instant and then he threw it

  it fell short but immediately he threw a
second a third a fourth by this time the
men in the house were directing their fire

the railroad mans magazine

at him alone and we could see one of them
outlined by a window pumping his gun for
all he was worth

  his foolhardiness finished him for we
concentrated our aim at him and saw him
stagger clasp his hands to his head and
tumble backward

  his partner was using the ledge of another
window as a rest and was emptying his
magazine like clockwork

  jets of flame and smoke at first hardly
discernible through the heat mist began to
show on the roof walkers fire-balls were
getting in their work he was now down on
one knee his gun rattling like a gatling

  we saw him topple over and knew he was
out of it

  the wind had whipped the flames until
the whole house was ablaze then a man
rushed out he stopped short for a moment
and filled his rifle and then made a break
for our lines shooting like a demon as he
came

  he didnt get far when we reached his
body he was still gasping but he was liter-
ally shot to pieces and died before we could
pick him up there was absolutely nothing

to identify him we made a shallow grave
near the burning house and buried him
unless the coyotes dug him up hes still there
with the secret of his identity secure

  the ranch-house was gutted and the dirt
walls collapsed when the fire was extin-
guished the next day a few human bones
were found in the ashes

  we took billy walker back to town with
a ball through his hip which left him a crip-
ple for life the last i heard of him he was
still sheriff of sherman county the three
others of our posse who were wounded pulled
through and are still very much alive the
union pacific paid the ten-thousand-dollar
reward which was apportioned among us
and gave frazer a check for the value of his
house and what it contained

  five men participated in the hugo hold-
up killed an express messenger who resisted
and got off with several thousand dollars
worth of mail and express matter

  we got two of them but the other three
disappeared utterly what became of the
boot no one has ever been able to determine
perhaps it burned that day at frazers where
the nameless outlaws found their finish

a million dollars

by b m adler

         what this great sum really earned when
         it was placed on public exhibition

doubt if you or any one else
outside of the scant half-dozen
people who were directly con-
cerned in the matter know of the
circumstances which brought on
the million dollar exhibit you
remember it eh as far as i am aware
it was about the only thing of its kind that
ever took place in this or any other country

  it was exactly what its name implied it
wasnt a million dollars worth of this or a
million dollars worth of that or a theatrical
production that cost an alleged million or a
million-dollar beauty contest or anything of
the sort it was just an exhibition of one
million in united states ten-dollar gold
pieces

  with some a mere misfortune acts as a
stimulant while an actual disaster is not
without its sharp delight these are the men
who bulge behind the ears being possessed
of highly developed bumps of combativeness
theirs is the gladiatorial spirit which loves
the struggle for retrievement for its own sake

  they build railroads irrigate arid regions
organize trusts and do big things on a big
scale their joy lies in overcoming and they
are never so dangerous to the men or things
opposing them as in the moment of supposed
defeat

  samuel doniford was one of this kind
as he stood at the window watching the
bustle on broadway below you would never
have dreamed that he left his hotel a few
weeks before a fairly wealthy man and had
returned to it early the same afternoon-
broke

  he was the only one who had suffered for
the reason that the enterprises in which he
was interested were in the foundation period
and he had paid the cost up to that point

  consequently the question of  settling up 
was a matter of a few hours only and when

it was all over he took himself off to the
catskills showing up at the mountain hotel
only at meals and bed-time and spending the
intervals among the pines thinking

  he had returned to town earlier in the day
intending going down to the  street but a
pile of accumulated correspondence prevented
him this explains why he was on upper
broadway at an hour when he would have
been on his way up-town

  yet in spite of all sammy d as he was
known in certain  street  circles looked as
if he was enjoying life to the full with his
hands plunged deep in his pockets his legs
somewhat apart a sparkle of content in his
eye and placid smoke-wreaths issuing from
his cigar at complacent intervals lie seemed
anything but the ruined speculator which in
actuality he was

  he did what the layman calls specu-
lating in wall street

  he had successfully promoted divers com-
panies some of which had subsequently flick-
ered out while others had remained attesting
to his integrity and such financial genius as
was his he took a  flutter  here and he
dabbled there-wherever he detected money
breaking the surface of the financial waters

  naturally such a business has its ups and
downs its big winnings and big losings its
unexpected plums and equally unexpected
frosts

  sam was and indeed had been on the
down-grade for several months the last
straw in his financial back-breaking was add-
ed when one special enterprise in which he
was interested and which had been looked
upon as sound was found to have founda-
tions of sand

  that is how it came to pass that within a
few brief hours he was removed from the
domain of the financially comfortable to the
region of the busted


the railroad mans magazine

  last of all came a black friday that
seemed to gloom over the last vestige of his
hopes

   above the roar and bustle of the thorough-
fare below rose the cries of the sellers of
 extras raucous and ear-splitting

  nother day of disaster more wall
street firms go down outlook darker
than ever 

  sam smiled as he listened but there was
the light of battle in his eye he looked at
the clock it was  pm and before long
the retreat from wall street would make itself
evident in the hotel-corridor which was a
favorite lounging place with bulls and
 bears

  then he went to the telephone and called
up the hotel-desk

  is that you carter he said as the
clerk answered  well i am not at home to
any one-no one remember-except mr
car well

    all right sir

   when mr carwell comes send him right
up and tell him to ring my bell three times
i shall not answer any other rings

   very good sir

  doniford hung up the receiver carefully
and with a curious smile on his face

   fifteen minutes later the door-bell of his
suite rang thrice and joseph carwell of the
brokerage firm of biddle carwell  johns
entered

   carwell and his associates cater to the out-
side public their private  lamb  trade being
comparatively small publicity being the
foundation of their business the principals of
the firm either in an individual or a col-
lective manner never failed to take advantage
of an opportunity which should keep their
names before the people

  carwell and sam doniford were old col-
lege chums when both drifted into the
financial district business bound them tighter
doniford not infrequently did outside
work for the firm and carwell and his asso-
ciates had been interested in the formers en-
terprises in more than one instance

  hallo sammy said carwell how goes
it 

   oh so so joe replied the other

    still broke sam  

  yes joe broke and down and out but
im nt crying about it

  carwell looked at his old chum with a
leer of suspicion for a moment then he
said

  you can count on me and a lot of the
boys to see you through

   i am not so sure of that smiled doni-
ford

   i think you ought to be pretty sure of us
by this time answered carwell

   why yes but there are limitations to
every mans friendship

  carwell tapped the floor with his walking-
stick with a touch of good-natured impa-
tience  out with it he said  what can
i do for you old man 

   it isnt a question of what you can do
but whether you will do it

   i am waiting for the question

  sam paused and blew a ring of smoke

   joe he said you may think me crazy
when you have heard what i am going to
say but i am not and i am going to boil
my remarks down anyhow i have-if your
offer still stands good-decided to join your
firm you asked me to do so once and i
refused

   bully cried carwell delightedly

  wait until i am through replied doni-
ford  i am not so sure that that smile of
yours wont come off when you hear the con-
ditions on which i am prepared to hitch up
with you

   go ahead said carwell confidently
 i think that anything that you may suggest
will look good to me

   thats the talk said doniford  as a
modest man i might feel embarrassed only i
know my own worth and now listen

   my total worldly possessions so far as i
can figure them out-including raiment to
wear and a ring wherewith to adorn-are
represented by a balance at my bank of about
eighty-nine dollars i wont come to you
with empty hands consequently i have got
to do things before i feel justified in asking
you to add my name to your letterhead
nonsense began carwell you must
be aware-

   i have thought this thing over joe and
i can only repeat that i will not come to you
unless i can bring with me something-it will
be mightily small perhaps-something any-
how that will make me feel that i have at
least added a drop or so to the big bucket-
not meaning to insinuate that you are running
a bucket-shop

  well go ahead said carwell

  doniford settled himself back in his chair
comfortably and began to talk

   with the average man money is the dom-
inant factor of interest and desire he said to
carwell everything in life tends to con-
tinue and foster this desire

  now the public would like to get in
a million dollars



visual touch with the object of its financial
affection very few- people have an oppor-
tunity of seeing a vast sum of money and i
can imagine nothing with a more drawing
power than the sight of a million dollars
carwell looked puzzled  what on earth
are you driving at he said

  well said doniford coolly i am as
convinced that an exhibition of one million
dollars in gold would attract thousands hun-
dreds of thousands provided it had its proper
setting and was boomed in the newspapers
carwell shook his head in a mystified man-
ner  but i dont see how

  naturally you dont replied doniford
if you did i shouldnt be talking to you
i have been doing the seeing and now-
what do you want to do you chump
asked carwell hurriedly beginning to show
signs of anger

    i want to put one million dollars on ex-
hibition and make the public pay to see it
doniford answered mustering up all his
courage

    well you must take the public for as big
a fool as you are said carwell  i think
you have gone balmy as well as broke

  all right you think it over sam
arose and took his hat in a minute he had
gone

  carwell was too dumfounded to call him
back

  i guess ive got him guessing said
doniford to himself as he stepped into a
neighboring cafe  ill just give him fifteen
minutes to think it over by that time he
will have made up his mind to agree if he
thinks any longer he will say  no 

  he was back at carwells door in just a
quarter of an hour

  hurrying through the outer office he
brushed aside the surprised office-boy who
really yelled card sir as if doniford
were a process-server

  carwell was standing just about where
doniford had last seen him

  thought it over asked doniford
  carwell smiled as if he had

   how much did you say you wanted  
asked the broker

  one million dollars

  in cash

    cash

  what kind of cash sam

   gold ten-dollar pieces

   and youll put it on exhibition like a
freak in a dime museum

   yep

  carwell paused then he paced the floor

of his office for a few moments and looked
blandly out of the window at the scurrying
money-bent crowd below

  wholl take care of it and see that it isnt
stolen   he finally asked doniford

  ill look out for that replied sam-
   and wholl secure me

    ou-that is your firm will secure you
im not going to invest the money

 thats a pretty big sum to lie idle sam
 ill pay you a mild interest on it said
doniford besides you get your share of
the gate receipts ill pay all of the ex-
penses and keep the balance for myself

   and do you expect to make very much  
carwell continued

   enough to buy an interest in your firm
replied doniford  it is the only way i
would really come in

  all of a sudden the newspapers were filled
with stories sunday and special articles all
based on the possibilities of a million dollars
in gold

  the topic appealed to the imagination of
the newspaper writers and partly from wal-
ter ripleys personal popularity with the
chiefs of the various staffs

  ripley was a slick young press-agent whom
doniford engaged-a clever writer a good
talker and a complete mixer

  i shall give but one example of the in-
genious nature of mr ripleys methods
letters appeared in a number of the newspa-
pers questioning the genuineness of the com-
ing exhibition these letters were due to
the fertile pen of the press-agent the next
day the newspapers came out with a statement
from the metropolian sub-treasury to the
effect that the ten-dollar gold pieces united
states currency selected by one of their
agents from the quantity submitted by samuel
doniford of new york city had been duly
passed on and found to answer all official
tests

  there also appeared a long letter from
biddle carwell s johns stating that they
personally pledged themselves that such an
exhibit was of the value that it purported
to be

  there further appeared several affidavits
from well-known men of the financial dis-
tricts-each of whom was a chum of doni-
ford-setting forth that the experts had ex-
amined the gold and had declared it to be
the real thing

  thanks to the united cogitations of doni-
ford and ripley the million when finally
arranged for exhibition purposes made an
impressive showing


the railroad mans magazine

   in the center of the ground floor of a large
office building on broadway a massive oaken
table had been built surrounded by a wire
cage

  around this and bolted to the floor was a
cage of thin but sufficiently strong iron bars
painted black which was so constructed that
it could be taken apart and easily shipped

  it was donifords intention to show the
million in a half-dozen or more of the bi

o

cities of the country

  the table was draped in black velvet and
the floor inside the cage was covered with a
material of the same somber hue on the
table itself were arranged forty boxes con-
taining the bullion

  the boxes were made of oak stained dark
green banded with wrought iron and having
on two sides bars of the same metal that slid
into sockets whose ends were fastened with
solid-looking padlocks

   they were also lined with black velvet and
so made that their sides could be dropped
down to expose the rows of seductive disks
which they contained overhead a cluster
of calcium lighs focused their radiance on
the coin

   each box contained twenty-five piles of ten-
dollar gold pieces a hundred coins to the
pile consequently there were twenty-five
thousand dollars in each box which multi-
plied by forty the number of the boxes
brought the total up to one million dollars

  the weight of a pile was  grains
troy the weight of the total exhibit being
about y pounds troy or say 
pounds to each box the height of each
pile was y inches and the diameter of each
coin  - of an inch there was much
more information regarding the money in
the little book which was distributed to the
visitors

  when the sides of the boxes were dropped
and the thousand golden piles with their set-
ting of dead black were revealed to the audi-
ence the result was magnetic

  first came a sort of half disappointment
then interest next speculation and finally
and by degrees as the possibilities contained
in the spread of gold began to impress it-
self upon ones mentality an absorption of
thought and feeling that wasnt many degrees
removed from actual hypnotism

  the dramatic instinct of doniford also
prompted him to endeavor to convey to the
audience the tremendous value of the exhibit
by means other than the cage and so forth
therefore he had a special detail of police
outside and inside the room in addition he

had a score or more of uniformed guards
posted around the cage keeping vigilant
watch upon the audience

    big fellows were they each armed with a
 rifle and wearing a businesslike and well-
 filled cartridge-belt

    in the lobbies also were more guards and
 in the cage itself were a couple of others

    the industrious ripley did not hesitate to
 tip off to some of his newspaper friends that
 during the course of the exhibit there would
 be more than one attempt made to overpower
 the guards and get away with the money
 which by no means detracted from the general
 interest in the show

    altogether then it wasnt surprising that
 on the first evening that the million was made
 manifest there was a full house including a
 big turn-out of sammys friends while the
 financial element of the city was also out in
 force

    at a late hour that night and at his hotel
 doniford was reading a statement to this
 effect

xet 

    sammy nodded his head in a satisfied man-
 ner saying to himself this makes a good
 start ripleys all right i shall look after
 that man in the future

 then he went to lied

 the exhibit passing through various stages
 of mere vogue soon became the biggest thing
 in town it took many and diverse forms

 the inevitable thriller based on  the mil-
 lion  made its appearance at a local theater
 pulpits by the score used  the million  as a
 text in one direction or the other at an
a million dollars



anarchistic meeting that was broken up by
the police  the million  served the purpose
of pointing a moral anent capitalists and their
useless hordes

  ripley grinned cheerfully when accused by
doniford of having put the police next
the gathering

  the vaudeville performances bristled with
gags regarding the exhibit and it was also
responsible for the popular song  i am the
man who made a million in a minute

  there was a million sextet interjected
into a broadway show  the merry million
maidens burlesque company appeared on
the bowery and the word  million  became
an integral part of the slang of the day
food products and articles of ware from hose
to neckties had  million  tacked on them

  the crop of cranks bred of  the million 
was naturally a large one and of all sorts and
descriptions it varied from the silent to the
noisy from the harmless to the more or less
dangerous from the blasphemous to the fer-
vently religious

  one old fellow with a long white beard
and a limp would walk around the big room
for hours at a time occasionally stopping to
make worshipful gestures toward the interior

  still another got into the habit of creeping
into the lobby two or three times during the
afternoon and evening and attempting to
preach on the sin of mammon worship using
 the million  as a text

  an elderly woman wearing a bonnet that
dated back to the sixties would insist upon
it that  the million  was a part of the sum
stolen from her by the government

  one gentle-eyed shabbily dressed elderly
man was accustomed to come to the box office
nightly and in an apologetic tone ask for the
loan of  the million  until the midday fol-
lowing on being refused or asked to call
again when the exhibition was over he would
extend profuse thanks and walk quietly away
he appeared every day during the run of the
exhibit and never attempted to voice a pro-
testation in regard to his hopes deferred

  a little fiery d arf with an enormous head
was another of the regular callers at the box-
office he was brief and to the point  this
money is mine give it up or ill- here
he would scowl fiercely growl in a guttural
fashion spin on his heel and exit rapidly

  one tall thin venerable woman button-
holed doniford one evening and informed
him that the incitement of people to greed
and covetousness was a sin and that she
looked upon all those who were responsible
for the exhibition as totally condemned

  scores on scores of unhappy creatures ill-
clad half-starved and shivering would im-
plore the doorkeepers to let them have just
a peep at  the million or would endeavor
by means of the most ingenious excuses to
gratify their wish

  several plain-clothes men who were sta-
tioned in the lobby informed doniford that
dozens of well-known crooks had taken in the
show either through curiosity or to pass upon
it from a professional standpoint one of
these on emerging from the hall late one
night was tapped on the shoulder by a de-
tective

   hallo red said he  i thought you
were out west  

  the crook grinned so i was but i
didnt like the climate

  what do you think of the show
queried the sleuth

  the grin broadened  say said the
snapper-up-of-unconsidered trifles  these
guys in new york is the easiest ever i seen
that the stuff was phoney the minute i put my
lamps on it and theys going down in their
jeans to give up thinking its the real thing
give me regards to the guy whos running this
joint and tell him id be proud to meet him
a fashionable doctor discovered that the
exhibit was responsible for a brand-new ner-
vous disease which he christened  million-
melancholia and to which a sunday news-
paper devoted a couple of pages with illus-
trations

  another doctor proved conclusively that
rapt gazing at  the million  developed an
hitherto unknown form of hysteria while
still another through die pages of a scientific
weekly laid stress on the curious type of hyp-
nosis produced by prolonged contemplation
of the glittering mass which hypnosis was
no figment of imagination but a fact

  but still the crowds paid their money to
see  the million

  on the other hand the show hadits tragic
side in the cases of at least three persons
the sight of the million seemed to bring
to a crisis a latent madness that lurked with-
in them

  two suicides according to the police rec-
ords were traceable to the unsatisfied desires
brought into being by the mocking money

  a husband seeking separation from his
wife alleged that she neglected her home for
the sake of the society of the million

  the jokesmiths of the evening newspapers
and the comic weeklies averred that  the mil-
lion  girl had replaced the matinee girl-
which was no joke


the railroad mans magazine

  a new color of a reddish saffron was chris-
tened  million mauve and dress goods and
milliners materials made the tint fashionable

  a number of well-meaning and altogether
mistaken persons wrote or spoke to doniford
begging him to close the exhibit on the score
of its demoralizing effect on the public to
which doniford politely replied  that money
of itself was a good thing and the result that
it wrought on people was the outcomc of their
temperament and not due to any evil inherent
in the coin

  it was in one of the big cities of the west
that the boxes containing the million dollars
were opened for the last time a number of
theater managers in various parts of the coun-
try had offered doniford later  dates  on
liberal terms but to these he turned a deaf
ear

  the exhibit had accomplished the purpose
for which it was brought into being the
account now stood thus

gross earnings including royalty on
sale of biddle carwell  johnss

 literature in halls  su

total expenses  

 balance 

  with three more days to run there was
every chance that  the million  would bring
his net profits up to  which was com-
fortably in excess of the sum he had originally
proposed should warrant him on accepting the
offer of biddle carwell  johns

  at length came the final hours of the public
life of  the million in spite of the nipping
cold of the night and the occasional flurries of
sleet that could find no resting-place on the
wind-swept and frozen pavements the gigan-
tic auditorium was crowded

   the million in this particular city had
caught on with society with a vengeance
this perhaps because society had been
brought into being within the generation and
by quickly acquired millions

  night after night there had been a tre-
mendously impressive display of gorgeous
decolletee gowns and plastrons and hoops
and headpieces of diamonds and many liv-
eries and lines of motor-cars and all the rest
of it

  in the lobbies there was the usual loud
chatter bad manners crushing and push-
ing and rushing and total disregard of every-
body elses rights and comfort

  but once inside-the spell of  the million 
wrought silence and the protean emotion of
greed that took on the forms of many emo-

tions and a curiously quiet crowd would
emerge from doors through which it entered

  there had been the usual difficulty in per-
suading some of the audience to vacate their
seats-there being the every-day sprinkling
of the slightly mad-but at length the
ushers had effected a clearance the hall was
being clad in its night raiment and the detail
of guards for the night clustered around the
cage awaiting the appearance of doniford
and ripley to open its door enter and lock
the boxes

  in the lobby and sheltering themselves as
best they could from the searching blasts that
swept in at the front doors was the platoon
of police that had been told to aid the guards
in their vigil

   tis the lucky boys we are said the
roundsman in command as he turned his
back to a howling gust  b-r-r-r id hate
to have a river post to-night

  except one was watchin th tide come
up an th tide go down wid his eyes behind
a glass and his lips to it suggested a fat
bluecoat with i fiery red mustache

   an a trial an a fine of thirty days pay
to follow replied rounds severely

  true tis but like th rest of me brave
fellow officers ive never been fined be-
cause-

  nivir mind your becauses broke in the
roundsman testily  be thankful that ye are
living this bitter night with hot coffee and
sandwiches to come and- he stopped

   an what  asked a blue-nosed cop

   curiosity killed the owl byrnes replied
rounds an i dont think it would be
fittin to encourage ye lest ye meet with a like
end but im told that mr doniford is a
mighty generous man an- by me countrys
sake what have we here 

  a savage and shrieking gust seemed to blow
into the lobby a weazened figure that weakly
tried to resist the rude play of the wind then
the blast died as suddenly as it had come
leaving its shivering plaything stranded in
the expanse of onyx and marble

  he was very old and a much-shrunken
man with a short thick snow-white beard
what little flesh was left on his deeply lined
face was livid scarlet and purple with cold
his eyes that had retreated far back in their
sockets were of an intense blue but watery
and uncertain a suit of shabby black shoes
cracked and holed but much polished where
there was any leather to polish a frayed but
clean collar the remnants of a white tie a
single glove and no overcoat constituted the
attire of the forlorn creature
a million dollars



  he looked around him dazedly tottered
and would have fallen had not the rounds-
man caught him

  whats the trouble friend said the
big policeman as he steadied the frail form

  nothing-i thank you quavered the
old man  i-ah yes i remember i was
on my way to-to-mv apartments when-
-he passed a blue hand over his forehead-
 something i-ah-do not know what- 
here he stopped and eyed the other in a
frightened fashion

  well sir said rounds encourag-
ingly go on you were saying that you
lived--where  

  why what does it matter to you where
i live sir cried the other shrilly i-
ah-you have no right to ask me how-
how dare you be guilty of such an-imperti-
nence i have done nothings wrong-noth-
ing wrong-why then-why-

  he would have fallen again if it had not
been for the arm of the officer  rounds 
beckoned to one of his fellows

   ring up headquarters he said in an
undertone  and tell em to send an ambu-
lance from st stephens hes nutty with
the cold and in a bad way generally

   i beg your pardon sir said the object
of  roundss  solicitude when he had re-
covered himself a little  but i am not-
not-quite myself to-night you see ive
been-yes-ive been-ah- again the
blue hand made its unhappy gesture over
the forehead

   of course sir of course said
 rounds  cheerfully  this weather would
put any man down and out-

   i-do-not quite understand answered
the old man doubtfully  i am-not down
i am-that is-i was- he mutterecl and
tapped his foot with weak impatience  it
is very annoying not to remember-just what
-one-is when-

   look here said the bluecoat coaxingly
 spose you rest for a while inside and have
a cup of coffee and then-well take you
home-

  no sir he answered with pitiful fierce-
ness  i allow no man to take me to my
apartments i am quite capable-of-of
you know-

  he stopped and sobbed miserably

  thats all right said the officer assur-
ingly and now come in out of the wind
and well fix you up and youll feel as fit
as a fiddle in no time

   both ambulances are out at st stephens
jim but theyll send one on from the burgess

in about fifteen minutes muttered the cop
who had been to the phone

  all right and say ask the box-office if
we can take this old chap inside the hall to
wait for the bus i reckon  the million 
wont be in no danger from him

  permission was given and almost carry-
ing the unfortunate the roundsman put him
into an orchestra chair looking around
cautiously the man in uniform produced a
flask from his hip pocket unscrewing its
top he poured some of the contents be-
tween the blue lips of his charge

  the old man gasped choked and stam-
mered incoherently

  feel better said  rounds

  thank you i-ah-yes-i was cold
he remained quiet for a few moments
as the stimulant began to take effect he
looked around him curiously until his eyes
rested on the million for the calciums
kept their steady vigil all night

  as he looked the spell began to work
upon him the livid hue of the cold seemed
to leave his cheeks he straightened himself
his trembling hands clutched convulsively at
the arms of his seat his breath came in
quick gasps and his eyes emerged from their
obscurity

  where am i and what is that he
asked in a tone of almost savage entreaty

  this is the coliseum and that is a
million dollars-you must have read about
it in the newspapers 

   a-million-dollars  he shrieked

   sure cooed the bluecoat laying his
hand soothingly on the others shoulder

  again there was silence when he spoke
again the voice of the poor wretch was no
longer recognizable but it had a ring of
command in it that sent a thrill of aston-
ishment through the seasoned rounds

   jarvis how often have i told you not
to serve the  vintage with the coffee
you know that i prefer that cognac that
villiers sent me from la rhame you are
very forgetful jarvis put a screen here
said the old man

  his thin fingers tapped impatiently on
the seat arm and the shrill voice went on
let the coach meet madam at midnight
no i am not going myself spread for
three in the red room i am not at home
to any one to-night except to mason and a
friend that he may bring with him do
you hear jarvis do you hear he
turned a pair of querulous eyes on  rounds
then his mood changed and he began
muttering broken phrases which so far as


the railroad mans magazine

the other could gather had to do with
financial affairs in which big sums of money
were involved

  kemp said the old man suddenly i
shall drive to my office to-day in the rus-
sian sleigh have it ready for me in ten
minutes and send across the road to ask if
munford will accompany me here he
broke off munford munford the infer-
nal scoundrel 

  he burst into vehement denunciations of
men whose names  rounds  could not quite
catch yet some of which seemed to be
familiar somebody had apparently done
grave injury to him then he stopped ab-
rupdy

  jarvis he said very feebly you will
have to help me from my carriage i-i
am not well this morning now now and
he put his arm inside that of the rounds-
man and rose with an effort to his feet
 we will go to the bank first he pointed
in the direction of  the million

  rounds thinking to humor him led
him slowly down the aisle the old mans
eyes their pupils dilating with every step
fixed on the glowing mass of yellow inside
the cage suddenly he halted and the blue-
coat could feel the blood leaping through die
shrunken veins of his companions hands

   that-is-the-

  the million said rounds softly
and even as he spoke a tremor ran through
the frail form that he was supporting

   the million  cried the old man with
an awful shriek you lie  the million 
went where other millions went they-
they- he drooped suddenly

  rounds lifted him up and placed him
in a seat then ran to the door just as the
ambulance came clanging down the street

  the shrunken form was lying easily in
the broad luxurious expanse of blue velvet
on which it had been placed by rounds
a sort of cynical smile curved the bloodless
lips

  it was an easy matter to expose the bony
chest for nothing but the coat and shirt
had to be removed

    heart disease said the surgeon  dead
as a door-nail

  with the surgeon had come some police-
men one was an old grizzled fellow who
had passed the greater part of his life on the
force obrien was his name on divers
occasions he had been promoted but on
divers occasions reduced by reason of his
combative instincts which were always get-
ting him into trouble he was an encyclo-

pedia of crime so far as the metropolis was
concerned even as he looked on the body
he uttered a cry

  well said rounds sternly have ye no
respect for the dead

  obrien pointed with a shaking finger to
a triangle of faint blue stars tattooed on
the breast of the dead man

   hold your tongue man hold your
tongue he said hoarsely do you know
the meaning of that

  no said rounds wonderingly while
the others gathered around for they knew
that it would take much to so move obrien

   do you remember any of you-no you
dont youre all boys-the failure of the
shipping and transportation bank way
back in the early sixties that ruined thou-
sands

  rounds nodded i have read of it
  do you remember its president

    i dont

   he was watson scoville once of die
united states army known as  stars  sco-
ville during the war with mexico he was
a captain he used to strip himself to the
waist and lie had three stars tattooed on his
breast and his men who loved the very
shoes of him gave him his nickname be-
cause of them-the stars

   rounds  drew his breath  i remem-
ber it all now-that is i read of it
obrien took no notice but went right on
 the reputation he had was great and
the friends he made were many and so
when he becameone of the directors of the
bank it flourished and he was made presi-
dent

   then boys it was women and wine
and all die rest of it then came specula-
tion and dien-the smash one morning
the banks doors were closed and  star 
scoville was missing it was a popular
bank and thousands of poor people were
ruined scoville was blamed for it all al-
though some declared that he had been led
to do wrong by a couple of his most inti-
mate friends who were his enemies

   he was never heard of except by rumor
and that from many lands he paused
and added slowly there was-and as
far as i know it is still standing-a reward
of five thousand dollars for him dead or
alive but show me the man that would
dare claim it

  then there was silence

  from behind the million glared at the
living and the dead with its dull yellow
stare
ten thousand miles by rail

by gilson willets

special traveling correspondent of the railroad mans magazine

down in sunny new orleans there are many good railroad yarns and little
wonder that mr willets while in that charming old city found a goodly
bunch and a kindly lot of railroaders to tell them thanks once more
boys many may marvel at the first story told here by the scottish disciple of sir
izaak walton while he patiently awaited a bite and yet the speed of a train
and the speed of a horse may be compared without creating much doubt espe-
cially when the horse is a kentucky thoroughbred spurred on by a pretty girl

no -romances of crescent city railroaders

a girl who played jockey to prevent a head-on collision-the stork
train-bledsoes locomotive ataxia-when seab davis
stayed-an engineers sixth sense

name explained to his fiancee that the night
operator on the preceding day had been
taken ill and couldnt come to work there-
fore con had remained at his post notifying
the despatcher at louisville of the night
mans illness and asking that a relief be sent
down at once but the needed relief had not
come and the conductor of the down train
had just brought word that the new man
would not arrive till morning

  the young girl annie mcsvvay had just
returned from a weeks visit to louisville
so all this was news to her

  look here con she said youre al-
most asleep now let me take your place
you go over to the farm and go to bed
con shook his head obstinately refusing
the girls pleading that she be permitted to
take his place con was a boarder at her
fathers house two miles from the track and
annie had promised to marry him she had
learned the morse code with her betrothed as
teacher and now she could  send  and  re-
ceive as proficiently as any regular ham

   your father brought dandy up here this

series began in june railroad mans magazine single copies  cents

         he south-bound night local of
           the louisville and nashville
           railroad stopped at bonnie-
           ville kentucky the only pas-
           senger to alight was a young
           woman who after entering the
           station put her hands on the operators
           shoulders and permitted him to kiss her

  oh you turtle-doves sang out the con-
ductor who had entered to hand the operator
certain documents jn yellow envelopes

  con he went on addressing the opera-
tor  the despatcher at louisville is sorry
but he couldnt send a relief by this train he
says if you can hold out till morning a re-
lief will arrive on the up train from nash-
ville

  ive been on the job now over thirty-six
hours replied the operator  but i reckon
i can hold out till morning

  the conductor departed the train pulled
out and the young girl said

why con whats happened you say
youve been here since yesterday morning
conrad wells that being cons full


the railroad mans magazine

afternoon for you to ride home con said
to annie dandy was a kentucky thorough-
bred which a louisville turfman was pas-
turing with annies father

  as annie reluctantly started to leave the
station the key began clicking she paused
listened and made a mental note of the in-
coming message the purport of which was
that the north-bound night local for louis-
ville must be flagged at bonnieville and held
there on the siding to permit the passing of
a certain special

  that up train is due to pass here in
about half an hour isnt it annie asked
well then con be sure you keep awake
what if you should go to sleep

  con reassured her and annie mounted
dandy and rode away she walked her
horse though the spirited animal several
times tried to break into a run her mind
was filled with thoughts of poor con down
at the station

 she recalled how haggard and hollow-eyed
he looked as the result of his long  trick
and her heart became heavy his smile
when he had assured her that he would have
no trouble in keeping awake was positively
ghastly annie shuddered

  what if he should go to sleep despite
himself she asked herself as she rode into
the barn-yard behind her fathers house

  her father employed but one hired man
the house was dark both master and man
had gone to bed annie proceeded to feed
dandy then suddenly as she poured a
measure of oats into dandys manger she
heard a locomotive whistle

  its the up train she said the whistle
means that it is approaching bonnieville sta-
tion in a moment it should stop

  she went out of the stable and listened
through the still night she could distinctly
hear the train rolling along two miles away

   great heaven  she exclaimed  it did
not stop con failed to flag it

  with presence of mind she flew to the sad-
dle which a few minutes before she had
taken from dandys back

  she knew that she must ride for the lives
of the passengers and crews of the up train
and the special and must reach one or the
other of them before they could meet

   ill ride to where the post-road crosses
the track four miles from bonnieville said
annie that gives me only two miles to
ride while the up train must travel four
miles

  this happened in the days of hand-brakes
when the louisville and nashville was a

  single-tracker through that part of kentucky
it must be explained that the track from bon-
nieville to a point four miles north of that
town was crescent-shaped and that two miles
from the track yet midway between the two
ends of that crescent stood the mcsway
farmhouse seven miles up the track from
bonnieville station was upton the next sta-
tion north

  the relative position of the fann and the
crescent-shaped track was such that in no
matter which direction annie rode the dis-
tance would be about two miles she struck
out on the post-road in the desperate hope of
reaching the track at the point where the
road crossed it at the end of the crescent
four miles north of bonnieville

  could she reach the crossing before the
local could travel the four miles up from
bonnieville or before the special could make
the three miles down from upton

  that was the supreme question in annies
mind as she let dandy go at full gallop

  she had heard her father say that dandy
could make a mile in four minutes she
would be at the crossing in about eight min-
utes if only the up train took a trifle longer
than eight minutes to run the four miles
around the crescent she would be in time

  before starting annie seized an unlighted
lantern after covering the first mile she
thought of lighting it

  she gave a cry of horror she had no
matches how foolish to have forgotten to
bring a match well the lantern was use-
less should she get rid of it throw it
away 

  she would keep it for maybe she would
pass some one on the way who would have a
match

  along the post road galloped dandy
annie wondered if the train was gaining on
her she had no way to reckon time all
she knew was that when she pulled up
dandy down at the crossing she was within
the rays of the headlight of the up train an-
nie breathed a sigh of relief she was in
time as the headlight drew nearer she
waved her dark lantern

  the engineer did not see her the train
rushed by

  at the crossing the post-road turned and
ran parallel with the track all the way to
upton quick as thought annie now drove
her heels into dandys ribs and tore on up
the track in a desperate race to overtake
the train

  if i can only catch up with the rear
car she told herself and hurl this lantern
ten thousand miles by rail



in through one of the windows-surely then
they will know enough to stop

  on on she raced a horse against a loco-
motive and she actually overtook the train
summoning all her strength then she flung
the lantern at the rear car trusting that by

  we had to shoot your horse miss mc-
sway was the reply the shot accounting
for the boom of cannon

   he was all tore to pieces and in terrible
pain continued the man who bent over an-
nie  he seemed winded beyond recovery

the engineer did not see her  the train rushed by 

sheer good luck it would crash through one
of the windows

  as she hurled the lantern however dandy
swerved and dashed pell-mell into a barbed-
wire fence sending annie flying into a
freshly plowed field she lay there very
still

  she thought she heard the boom of a can-
non and it awoke her men stood over and
around her and she heard one of them sav
its all over hes dead

  whos killed were annies first words

thats the way with thoroughbreds theyll
run till they drop never to rise again

   dandy dead  gasped annie  my
poor father he was responsible for that
horse and the owner may make us a deal of
trouble

  she remembered the reason for her ride
and now she quickly explained the situa-
tion to the men around her

  we thought something was wrong said
the conductor  or you wouldnt have tossed
your lantern into the car hey there  turn-


the railroad mans magazine

ing to a trainman you take a lantern for-
ward well back down to bonnieville
and then resume the run and pick you up
after weve let the special pass

  annie suffering nothing worse from her
fall than a badly bruised body walked to
the train which was backed to bonnieville
station

some such thought seemed also to be in the
conductors mind for he said

  lets think a minute little girl an
operator worn out by a watch of thirty-six
hours falls asleep just because he cant keep
awake possibly he had been asleep only
one little minute when my train which he
should have flagged rolled by and woke him

   what do you suppose happened to con
wells that he didnt flag us asked the
conductor of annie on the way back

    i suppose he fell asleep replied annie
poor con do you suppose they will dis-
charge him for this we want to marry
next month but if they discharge him-well
i dont know what well do and poor
dandy what will my father say will
he have to pay for that horse do you think 

  she explained how the thoroughbred had
been entrusted to her father for pasturing
and exercise

   itll be all right little girl dont wor-
ry said the conductor comfortingly

   at bonnieville station the engineer backed
the train on to the siding while the con-
ductor and annie rushed breathlessly into
the station-onlyto find that conrad wells
was not there

   where can he possibly be   asked an-
nie so deeply distressed that she could
speak hardly above a whisper

  she felt that con had run away

  while they searched in vain for the miss-
ing operator the special thundered by-none
on board knowing that the train had been in
dire peril

  annie pleaded with the conductor to per-
mit her to take cons place till he should
return

  perhaps he chased after the train she
said  and is somewhere up the track now
on his way back

  anyhow she held the conviction that con
wells had flown for all time from that region

 i want to marry the
 girl that sent me
 this draft for a
 hundred dollars

up too late however to flag us well
con was an imaginative customer he sees
the two trains come together

   he beholds fearful slaughter he feels
that he is disgraced in the eyes of the rail-
road company he is ashamed to face you
the girl he is engaged to marry above all
he hears the victims of the disaster crying
out their reproaches between their groans of
agony maddened by these thoughts and
visions his nerve gone and his mind un-
balanced by what he has done he rushes out
into the night raving not knowing where he
is going or what he is doing that is how i
account for cons absence but he will turn
up to-morrow the conductor added con-
solingly and if he is discharged annie
you stick to him

  of course i will she answered and
now-ill take his place to-night and stay
here till the relief comes in the morning i
understand all the duties of an operator

  the upshot of the matter was that the train
pulled out for louisville leaving annie mc-
sway in charge at the bonnieville station
where she remained on duty till morning

  then she trudged homeward tears well-
ing from her eyes on the way con wells
her sweetheart had not appeared
ten thousand miles by rail



  her father after hearing the story tried
to show annie that he was not worrying over
the death of dandy annie however fully-
understood how deeply anxious he was about
that horse and silently she grieved with
him

  two days later two letters were handed
to farmer mcsway at the bonnieville post-
office one was for himself-and it con-
tained a bill for one thousand dollars from
the louisville owner of the thoroughbred
with a curt note saying that mcsway had
permitted the animal to be ridden reckless-
ly to death

  the other letter was for annie-an offer
from the railroad company to employ her as
successor to conrad wells as operator on
the day watch at bonnieville

  during the two days since her wild ride
annie had not heard a word from con nor
had any one else he had disappeared as
if swallowed up by the earth furthermore
conrad wells was never heard from there-
after by any one in bonnieville

  annie accepted the proffered position with
the determination to save part of her salary
every month to pay for the horse

  weeks passed not another line was re-
ceived by mr mcsway from the
owner of the horse yet the old man
grieved over the matter more and
more each day he wrote to the
owner pleading that he be released
from responsibility for the death of
the horse saying that it was a
great ride for a great purpose and
that a rich man should not seek
damages from a poor man  con-
sidering the circumstances under
which the horse met its end

  no answer came from louisville

annies father grieved till he died

   a broken heart annie sobbed

  after her fathers death annie
continued to run the farm with the
help of the hired man at the same
time attending to her duties as oper-
ator at the station at length after
weary months of work she had
saved one hundred dollars which
she sent to the owner of dandy say-
ing that it was the  first instalment
on account and adding that she
would send further instalments of a
hundred dollars as fast as she could
save the money till the horse was
paid for

the very next day the down train
from louisville brought a stranger

whom bonnieville viewed with awe he
wore a wondrous expanse of colored shirt-
front and a marvelous waistcoat a huge
diamond bedecked his shirt-bosom while an-
other adorned one of his fingers

  im looking for a young woman named
miss annie mcsway he said to the opera-
tor at the station

   i am miss mcsway was the answer
you are well then look here when
does the next train pull out for louisville
 at five oclock this evening

   ah its two oclock now can you be
ready to go up on that train with me miss
mcsway

   why sir what on earth do you mean  
 i mean that i want to marry the girl that
sent me this draft for a hundred dollars for
a dead horse o mine i was the owner of
that horse when i wrote your father en-
closing a bill for the animal i didnt know
the circumstances under which the horse was
killed as soon as i heard all about it how-
ever i let the matter drop and went off to
europe forgetting to write to your father to
tell him it was all o k and that dandy
was killed by a jim-dandy girl in a mighty
good cause and to let the matter drop

jack i cant move my legs


the railroad mans magazine

    well miss annie
here i am they tell
me your father died
of a broken heart be-
cause he could not pay
for that horse im
here to make repara-
tion to his daughter to
the farthest extent a man can go
i want you to marry me a girl
like you diat saves a hundred dollars out of
a picayune salary to pay what she supposes
to be her fathers debt is a girl wholl make
a good enough wife for me are you game
miss annie

  annie said she couldnt even entertain such
a proposition-and the man with the loud
clothes went away with a smile that showed
that he wasnt to be defeated easily in any-
thing he undertook

  to bonnieville he returned once a week
for weeks and weeks always to put the same
question to annie he sent a whole string of
horses to be boarded at her farm and paid
fancy prices for their keep so that annie
soon found that the income from her four-
footed boarders amounted to about ten times
the amount of her salary

   but then she argued  he may take
the horses awav some time and then wherell
i be

  so she clung to her job as operator at the
bonnieville station despite the income for
the care of the horses

  by ginger youve got the grit of a man
cried the turfman from louisville one day
on arrival at bonnieville it was then four
months after he had made annie his first
proposal of marriage

  i want to tell you annie he said that
this siege is on for keeps-and i never
give up

  he never did give up he discarded his
noisy clothes and arrived one day in bonnie-
ville in refined apparel

  annie smiled as he approached

  that day the village parson performed a
marriage ceremony after which annie the
bride went up to louisville with her bride-
groom to live in a big house and enjoy the
happiness she had earned

  this tale was related by a gray-haired
scotchman while he fished in mississippi
sound at pass christian mississippi from
the end of a pier he is a retired railroader
well-to-do in worldly goods i sat beside
him as he told the story-and he didnt get
a single nibbla that didnt bother him
however for during his recital he seemed to

have forgotten all about the business of
fishing

  sweet annie mcsway he exclaimed
after finishing the tale ut was a bonnie
lass of bonnieville she was

   oh then you knew her yourself-
personally i said

  aye and her poor father too and a
braw mon lie were lad dont ee see lad
t was i that was the new mon up from
nashville that relieved sweet annie mcsway
that marnin after her greet ride and t
was i lad that relieved her every nicht at
the end of her worko the dee

  no wonder you
know the details of her
story so well i said

  my meeting w i t h
diis interesting scotch-
man was purely acci-
dental and the manner
of it was this

  on february  last
in a pullman of a
louisville and nashville train on the run
from mobile to new orleans a traveling
salesman handed me a card on which was
printed this warning

  the drummer explained that the warning
was given to traveling men at the time of the
mardi gras in the crescent city because ho-
tel accommodations were practically impos-
sible unless one had engaged rooms ahead
and also because business could not be trans-
acted with expedition while the crowd re-
mained in the city to avoid new orleans
the date being february  i left the train at
pass christian to remain there overnight

  in that tourist resort i thought there
would be a dearth of railroad stories never-
theless i went down to the station to look
and listen for any possible grist for my mill

  a train from new orleans pulled in in
the cab was an engineer whom i had met
two years before while staying at biloxi-
engineer francois who had the run between
new orleans and mobile

  hallo he cried remembering me
 here let me show you a shaving from one
of the biggest wads in the country

   he displayed a crisp new five-dollar bill
a lady from new york handed me that in
an envelope when i pulled her into new or-
leans this morning said francois at the
ten thousand miles by rail



same time slie gave my fireman three dol-
lars and the conductor and trainmen got
something too at every change-crew place
all the way down from new york she sent
out tips from her private car-just like these
the lady was mrs russell sage shes here
for mardi gras

  just then francois received the signal to
pull out  go talk to old man ruth-
erford he shouted as he opened the throt-
tle there he is-down there by the sta-
tion-cussing about something he came
down with us from new orleans to fish
so-long 

  in front of the station the man whom
francois had called old man ruther-
ford was venting his indignation thus
uts feelin sick i am ut will not be
good for that mon if iver i catch im wi that
feeshin-rod

  and he swore some more

  thought you were a
good presbyterian mr
rutherford said one
of the station-men

  aye mon so i be
but dont ye see i dont
gie a saxpence aboot the
kirk ween im mad like
noo

  and he tore off to-
ward the town swearing
some more in his excitement

   hes old man rutherford said the sta-
tion-man  and hes a regular bang-goes-
saxpence highlander hes an old
railroader from kentucky he be-
gan as an operator became a con-
ductor and retired some years ago

lives in new orleans and comes
over here once a week to fish on
the trip pver here just now some
one stole his fishing-tackle and
thats what hes so mad about but
he will buy a new rod and will
fish just the same youd better get next to
him-hes chock-full of railroad stories
the next morning i found mr ruther-
ford at the end of the pier i introduced
myself and after a while he said

   hast iver heard lad of sweet annie
mcsway the bonniest lass of bonnieville
kentucky tis a sad tale mostly but if
tis stories of the railroad youre feeshin for
tis of sweet annie mcsway that im thankin
i must tell ye aboot

  forthwith he spun the yarn in his own
dialect the most important facts in which i
have repeated here

   	rr

  a girl with wondrous hair and exceeding
efficient as a news-agent stood behind her
phalanx of magazines at the news-stand in
the union station new orleans and be-
stowed upon me a generous smile as i picked
up a copy of the railroad mans aiaga-
zine for march  and dropped a dime
into her self-supporting palm

   i know you she said  your picture
is in there pointing to the red-covered
magazine  go over to the grunewald ho-
tel she added after having asked me a
million questions about the great white
way  theres a stack of two hundred saw-
bones over there from the eye-see and the
yazoo they just came in this morning

  i went to the grunewald and made the ac-
quaintance of some of the sawbones they
were members of the joint association of
surgeons of the illinois central the yazoo
and mississippi valley and the indiana
southern railways

  they had just come from a smoker given
them by the new orleans officials of the
eye-see and they told me of how they had
presented a big mahogany hall-clock to their
secretary dr charles fry who had been
sawing bones for the eye-see for three and
thirty years and was altogether the great-
est-ever railroad surgeon

  one of the eye-see doctors then went
with me to a quiet corner of the lobby under
the balcony where the orchestra played and
related this story of an eye-see engineer
will bledsoe with a run out of memphis
tennessee to paducah kentucky
was such a marvel of physical per-
fection that the eye-see boys at
memphis called him the health
trust

   i reckon said bledsoes fire-
man jack manting that your
brotherhood never will have to pay
you an allowance for sickness
it would seem to me that youre too
blamed healthy bledsoe

   ive been railroadin for twenty-one
years replied bledsoe and ive been a-
member of the b l e
for ten years ive never
had to accept a cent of
disability money

whereupon bledsoe
jumped up into his cab
and pulled out for padu-
cah that night when he
returned to memphis and
looked after his engine
he said to manting


the railroad mans magazine

  jack i cant move my legs ive known
it ever since we struck the yard limits and i
thought it was only because my feet were
asleep but its something more than that
jack look

  bledsoe made a painful effort to step
across the cab but his legs wabbled wo-
fully the fireman had to lift bledsoe from
the cab after which a number of roundhouse
men carried him to the eye-see hospital
where a doctor examined him

  bledsoe said the doctor youre the
last man one would expect to find with this
disease theres no apparent cause for it
youre not a drinker

   but what is the matter with me doc-
tor asked bledsoe

  locomotor ataxia

  you mean locomotive ataxia well what
am i in for

   youve got one hope of getting mended
so you can walk same as ever thats from
treatment by some osteopath

  for weeks after that every sunday the
eye-see boys called at the hospital to see
engineer bledsoe who had always been a
mighty popular man

  ive got locomotive ataxia boys he
would tell them  you fellers that work on
locomotives had better look out or youll get
it too

   but what do we have to do to keep away
from this here locomotive ataxia his
friends would ask

  well you see boys you mustnt keep
your legs too still when youre ridin in your
cabs you must keep your legs wigglin
most of the time if you do that you wont
get locomotive ataxia like ive got

  for weeks after that firemen noticed that
the men at the throttles out of memphis
kept their feet wiggling-on the sly when
they thought their firemen werent looking

  time passed bledsoe disappeared from
memphis and eye-see men wondered what
had become of him one day an engineer
who had been taking a holiday and improv-
ing it by traveling through missouri re-
turned and said

   ive found will bledsoe boys found
him at kirksville missouri on the wabash
hes got a store there the dinkiest little place
in mercantile history

  i put in part of my vacation he con-
tinued  taking a treatment at a sanatorium
at kirksville there was an osteopathic col-
lege run in connection with the sanatorium
and on the first day of my arrival what do
i see opposite that college but a little shop

with a big sign on top of it readin will
bledsoe

    wonder if thats our will bledsoe that
got the locomotive ataxia  i asked myself
and then i went over to the store to take a
look painted on the side of the shop were
these announcements  dealer in medical
text books candies and cigars also soft
drinks and stationery sandwiches

  well boys i took special note of the
 stationery sandwiches -and in just a min-
ute ill tell you what happened to that sign

   i entered the shop no one was there
i waited in a moment in walks a young
chap who weighs himself out a pound of
candy wraps it up puts some money on the
counter and walks out

   pretty soon another young chap comes in
helps himself to six cigars lays a quarter on
the counter and takes his leave

   next comes a kid with a bundle under
his arm he opens it takes out a string of
sausages lights an oil-stove over in the cor-
ner cooks the sausage and puts them back in
the paper then he slices off a lot of cold
ham cuts up half a loaf of bread and
makes the tow ingredients into sandwiches
after which he puts some coin on the counter
and starts to walk out

   then i says

   what-all kind of a place is this here
shop anyway 

   its bledsoes the kid answered  he
cant walk much and hes here in the shop
only part of the day-because hes got loco-
motor ataxia this is the littlest shop in
missouri but its got more clerks than the
biggest department-store over in st louis
this shops got at least six or seven hun-
dred clerks

  now whatever do you mean i ask
i mean he replies that we students
in the osteopathic college and the patients in
the osteopathic sanatorium recognize the
helplessness of will bledsoe who supports
his family by running this shop so we come
in here and help ourselves to anything we
want and leave the money you see bled-
soe is taking the treatment at the hospital
and that keeps him absent from the store
well now boys went on the engineer
 when i hears all that the tears come
mighty near the surface and i asks where
bledsoe lives then i goes down street till
i finds his house yes there was bledsoe
with all his locomotive ataxia still in his legs
so that he could only drag em along behind
him like they was -two balls and chains he
was haulin and cheerful say he was
ten thousand miles by rail



more cheerful than most of us folks
down here whove all escaped loco-
motive ataxia by wigglin our legs in-
cessant in the cab like poor bledsoe
told us to do

   you see bledsoe has a wife and
two kids but he manages to keep em
fed and housed and clothed and hap-
py with the money he gets from that
little store plus the disability allow-
ance which he receives from the
b l e

  now what i say boys is that 
will bledsoe is a true hero of great
fortitude and courage and i vote that
we goes right down-town and mail bledsoe
a lot of post-cards with our sentiments writ-
ten onto them

   i know what ill say on mine said one
of the eve-see engineers  im going to
write on mine  dear will whats a sta-
tionery sandwich   

   what do you mean   asked the traveler
who had discovered bledsoe at kirksville

   didnt you say his sign on the side of his
store read  stationery sandwiches   

   oh yes i forgot to tell you about that
i told bledsoe about it and he laughed in
guffaws that could be heard clean down the
street to the osteopathic college he hobbles
down to the shop with him then and as soon
as he goes there he takes a paint-brush and
hobbles outside and begins work on that sign
saying

    i never noticed before that this here
sign reads incorrectly i see now whats the
matter with it it is ridiculous the way it is
isnt it the darned things is spelled wrong
it should read this-a-way

   and bledsoe daubs out the  e  in sta-
tionery and puts the letter  a  over the daub
so that the sign then read

    stationary sandwiches

 there  says bledsoe
stepping back and view-
ing his handiwork now
she reads all right i dont
guess people will laugh
any more at that sign
a few days after meet-
ing the  stack of saw-
bones  as the result of the
tip given by the girl of the
news-stand i stood again
in her presence

 seen the crowd   she
asked no then go
out to the end of the train-
shed and youll see the whole population of
new orleans somes in autos somes in
carriages somes afoot somes on mules
somes colored somes white and somes-
whats doing i interrupted

the stork train

  theyre waiting for the  stork train
  stork train

  yep stork train an eye-see trains
coming in with a special car full of babies
from new york consigned to new orleans
folks that havent any babies of their own
and are going to adopt the car-load

  a half-hour later i stood in the midst of
a cheering crowd of men and women at the
outer end of the train-shed as the stork
train pulled in with its car-load of babies
there were about sixty babies in that car
aged from eighteen months to three years all
from the new york foundling and orphan
asylum people in new york didnt seem
to want babies while all new orleans
seemed to want babies mighty bad

  number forty-four shouted joe but-
ler the asylum man in charge of the car as
he took a red-haired youngster from the arms

seab put his well-boiled
arm into the steam


the railroad mans magazine

of one of the trained nurses  whos got
the ticket for number forty-four

  here came the answer a middle-aged
man with a countenance that gossiped of
extreme embarrassment got out of an auto-
mobile came forward and took possession
of number forty-four

  number eleven shouted joe butler
taking a black-haired two-year-old from a
nurses arm  whos here for number
eleven  

   me  yelled a young woman from a
place in the densest section of the crowd

   give that woman a chance to come for-
ward shouted joe butler

  aint it cute fairly shrieked a creole
lady as the young woman received the little
one and nearly suffocated it with a series
of foster-mother kisses

  just then a man at my elbow said  hal-
lo gil

  i turned why hallo gil i responded

  it was mr gilbert a traveling pullman
inspector whom i had met two years before
on the florida east coast railway we
talked of babies of course since babies were
now crying all around us in the midst of en-
gine-bells and whistles and escaping steam
and the yells of the crowd every time joe
butler appeared on the car-platform with a
new kid

  yes said mr gilbert babies and
children play their part in railroading i
was on an illinois central train out of
springfield illinois back in september 
when we ran into an open switch at di-
vernon

   the engineer of that train was alf
shell the fireman ed taylor in the
pullman in which i was riding was ethel
barrymore the actress as the train rounded
a curve miss barrymore sitting by the win-
dow suddenly cried in horror

    theres a child on the track 

   she jumped up terribly excited she
could not see up the track now the curve
having given her only the one swift glimpse
in which she had seen thechild she seemed
to be holding her breath now expectantly

  meantime alf shell had tooted his
whistle frantically-and now next instant
both miss barn-more and i saw the child a
little girl walk through a gate into a yard
beside the track

   but just then came a fearful crash-and
the next thing i knew i was thrown violently
to the floor while miss barrymore was hurled
against the opposite seat

  for a second all was still then came

wild frenzied shouts passengers were climb-
ing out of the windows others were pray-
ing some were laughing hysterically miss
barrymore sat perfectly still and calm but
with a look of horror in her face

    i wonder how many graves were filled
just then   she said

     come out and see i replied

   i tried to get out by the door it was
jammed i dropped out of a window and
while the porter assisted miss barrymore
from the inside i helped her through the
window from the outside i left her standing
there and hurried forward to see  how many
graves had been filled

   i found that the train had run into an
open switch and that engineer alf shell and
fireman ed taylor had jumped just after
blowing the whistle so frantically to warn
the child on the track both the enginemen
were injured but that seemed to be the total
of casualties

   the engine had plunged into a ditch and
was reduced to scrap

    no ones hurt except the engineer and
fireman said the conductor

  just then i heard an agonized scream
it came from the yard into which miss
barrymore and i had seen the little girl walk
after stepping from in front of the train i
can see miss barrymore standing in that
yard now with her hands to her face her
whole attitude one of horror and pit that
scream-no it was not the actress who had
screamed it was unmistakably the scream
of a mother only a mother could give such
an agonized cry as we had heard

   with the conductor i rushed into the
yard the little girl lay there-dead

  her name was bettie mcguire said
miss barrymore wiping away her tears  i
gathered that from what the stricken mother
said before she began raving like you hear
her now

    the mother on her knees beside the dead
child seemed to have gone suddenly mad
with her arms uplifted she cried over and
over

    god have mercy upon us and incline
our hearts to keep thy law 

  while the crazed mother continued re-
iterating this prayer the injured engineer
was carried into the yard and laid on the
ground beside the lifeless child

im so glad i didnt hit her he said
not comprehending that the child was dead

 thank heaven i saved the kid

   just then men carrying fireman taylor
entered the yard taylor heard what the en-
ten thousand miles by rail



gineer said and noticing that the child was
not alive as the engineer supposed put his
finger on his lips and cried no  just as
one of the men was about to tell the en-
gineer the truth the fireman then beckoned
to us to come nearer to him and he whis-
pered 

    dont tell shell about the kid-or hell
never recover from this he is mighty fond
of kids dont tell him the truth 

  before fireman taylor finished his
warning ethel barrymore knelt over the in-
jured engineer shell and i heard her say-
ing to him

  number fifty-nine shouted joe but-
ler holding up one more little one the
crowd flung laughter up to the roof of the
train-shed and pullman inspector gilbert
standing beside me cried

  hanged if it aint a piccaninny

the jo-jah lad who stayed

  seab davis georgia railroad engineer
with a run between atlanta and augusta
came home with his hands skinned down to
raw beef his face boiled to a lobster-red
and with the hair of his head singed down to

yes yes the little girl is all right
you saved her shes perfectly happy now 
here inspector gilbert of the pullman
company stopped short i could see that he
couldnt say more

  number thirty-five cried joe butler
from the rear platform of the stork train as
a trained nurse put another child into his
arms whos here for number thirty-five
as a happy-faced man and woman came
forward to claim number thirty-five i turned
again to inspector gilbert and said

  but what killed little betty mcguire
surely she was not hit by the train for you
and miss barrymore-both saw her toddle in-
to the yard

  she was killed he replied by flying
fragments of alf shells demolished engine
when it plunged into the ditch

a shortness that made him look as if he had
been the victim of an apache buck

  a southern railroad man at new or-
leans told me the story

  just before seab pulled into clarkson
jo-jah on his run that day suh he suddenly
became fully aware that something had hap-
pened to his engine he saw his fireman
land in a heap on the tender heard a rip-
ping and banging all around him saw the
cab getting knocked to smithereens and then
-the steam-gage and steam-pipes let loose
and seab found himself in the midst of
scalding steam worsen any russian bath at-
tendant ever unloaded on a fat man

  drivin-rod broke you hit it right
suh and when a drivin-rod breaks in one
of these modern engines the men in the cab
should be good and ready for the next world


the railroad mans magazine

  well sub what did my jo-jah engineer
friend do did he jump for his life and let
the train wreck itself to suit itself no sub
seab davis stayed with his face and hands
scalded he crawled out of the window and
himg onto die outside of the cab till the es-
caping steam had abated he didnt wait
long however for a smash was due at any
second so with the cab filled with scalding
steam and while the broken rod was pound-
ing away seab put his already well-boiled
arm into the steam again found the air-
brake jammed on the air and stopped the
train

  that suli is how a jo-jah engineer
averted a wreck and saved the lives of many

the sixth sense

  the sixth sense said a louisville and
nashville man at the l and n station in
new orleans is what makes a good engi-
neer unless he possesses it liell be having
accidents all the time and his engine will
frequently need the shop ill bet no en-
gineer can define that sixth sense in words
we who possess it simply know that we can
feel the track and road-bed under us that we
can hear see and feel things about the ma-
chinery-things of which the fireman may
have no knowledge im going to show you
how one of our engineers charlie wilson
who pulls the washington - new orleans
limited between montgomery and mobile
proved the possession of his sixth sense

  one night in march  charlie wil-
son was pulling his all-pullman train down
to mobile as the train rushed along he said
to his fireman

    did you feel something just then -as
if we had dipped in and out of a hole 
hole nothing exclaimed the fireman
what do you think this road-bed is a
sieve a broiling-iron

   wilson kept perfectly quiet after that as
mile after mile was run off but all the time
he was exercising his sixth sense he didnt
look or listen or smell or taste or touch but
he just let his body be a part of his ma-
chine twice again he was conscious that
the engine seemed to dip in and out of a
hole the last one so deep as it were that he
put on die emergency and stopped

   whats wrong  asked the fireman
theres something wrong with this
road-bed-i dont know just what replied

wilson as he lighted a torch climbed down
from the cab and walked slowly up the track

  up came the conductor wanting to know
why wilson had stopped the crack train on
the line in the middle of nowhere and for no
apparent reason

    i dont know why i stopped said wil-
son  but im not going on till ive ex-
amined this track for a mile ahead

    youre crazy wilson said the con-
ductor as he walked beside the engineer

    sure hes crazy concurred the fireman
who was accompanying them on the trip of
inspection

   they had proceeded perhaps five hun-
dred yards when-splash  they had stepped
into a washout three feet deep and fifty feet
long

    well am i crazy   asked wilson

  no youre a he witch replied the
conductor  howd you know of this 

    sixth sense said wilson

  whats that the fireman asked

    ask the psychologists replied wilson
 ive got it and they havent yet they can
tell you what it is while i cant

  wilson backed the train to a siding and
reported the damage to the track-then
waited till the wreckers came up from mobile
and bridged the washout

  meantime the passengers slept on know-
ing nothing of the cause of the delay till
morning came and the train resumed its run
arriving at mobile a committee of passen-
gers called the engineer down from his cab

  mr wilson said a bernstein the
spokesman  in behalf of the passengers on
this train i want to thank you for what you
did last night your judgment and cool-
ness undoubtedly saved the train from a ter-
rible disaster but for your-i dont know
exactly what you call it-we would have
run into that washout and many of us might
now be dead or injured also on behalf of
the passengers i wish to tender you this
purse as a token of our appreciation

wilson accepted the purse and made a
simple reply that he had only done his duty

   when he got to the roundhouse and
opened the purse he whistled in astonish-
ment and then smiled turning to a group
of engineers he said

     if any of you fellows own a sixth sense
just you use it to the limit on every run
take it from me-theres money in it last
night the proceeds of my sixth sense netted
me a sum equal to two months pay

ft i  he seven-ten local from sayre
ilfilifl had pulled into the station at

oil	hi bill ill geneva and big jim
jb i wk haughes the engineer was
leaning out of the cab waiting
for the passengers to alight
before taking her to the yard it was the end
of the run and the prospect of a hot appe-
tizing meal to a tired hungry man after a
hard day at the throttle is alluring

  haughes glanced back impatiently as the
crowd began to thin out on the platform but
did not get the signal to pull the local to the
siding then he saw that the conductor was
talking with the operator who had just come
out of his office and as he looked both
turned and came toward him the latter
had a despatch in his hand he held it out
toward big jim

   i guess you dont get a hot supper to-
night jim said the-operator grinning as
they neared him unless you can pick it

out of the gravel between here and man-
chester

the big engineer swung lightly down from
the cab and mechanically took the despatch
from the operators hand

engine  will run extra to manches-
ter and await orders it read it was signed
by dawson the division superintendent

 its a six-car vestibule special explained
the operator as haughes looked interroga-
tively at him the one theyve been talking
of trying to have compete with that new
nine-hour train of the centrals

haughes nodded for weeks every engi-
neer on the lone star valley railroad had
been expecting that the company would try
the experiment and few of them relished the
idea of being made the goat for with the
curves and grades of the valley a ten-hour
schedule between buffalo and new york
much less one of nine hours seemed an im-
possibility

   i wish dawson had picked some other
man than me for the job said haughes
as he climbed back on the foot-board taking
advantage of the engineers time-honored
privilege to grumble at the thought of a lost
supper  theres nothing but a call-down
in it for any one if you cant make the
schedule and explanations to make if you
take chances id rather let some one else
have the glory

  the others smiled jim haughes was
known from end to end of the system
as one of the most daring engineers in the
roads employ both the conductor and the
operator knew that he would have been the
most disappointed man on the seneca divi-
sion if the super had assigned the run to
some one else while he might be out-
wardly fretted big jim exulted

  well good luck to you jim said the


the railroad mans magazine

conductor who had not yet spoken after a
pause if old  cant bring that special
through on time there isnt another engine
between here and buffalo that can he
glanced sharply down the empty platform
and gave the signal to go ahead

   five minutes later having switched the
local to its accustomed siding  was eat-
ing up the miles to manchester at man-
chester haughes and stebbins his fireman
had hardly got  off the turntable before
dawson the division chief came up

    rochester wires that the special left there
eighteen minutes late he said  so shell
probably lose four or five minutes more on
the grade between here and mendon how
much of that do you think you can make up
haughes 

  big jim set down the oil-can he had
been using and looked critically over his
engine before replying after his grooming
 sputtered and gurgled skittishlyas though
impatient to be off

   im not promising anything mr daw-
son he said slowly after a moments
thought but if we dont lose too much time
between here and geneva well make up
some of it all right only give me a clear
track from burdett on

  the special has the right-of-way over
everything said dawson casting a satis-
fied eye over s shining brasses so its
up to you to make up what you can

   with another nod he turned and went back
toward the telegraph - office haughes
shrugged his shoulders as he gazed after
him

    as usual harry he repeated somewhat
cynically to the fireman its up to us
stebbins grunted his concurrence in the
opinion he did not believe in wasting
words and just then he was busying him-
self with a final examination of s in-
tricate anatomy

shes ok jim he said a moment
later as he crawled from beneath the engine
and ready for the ninety miles to sayre
haughes held up his hand with a warning
gesture

    theres the special blowing at the cross-
ing three miles this side of farmington he
said after listening a moment shell be
here directly

   true to dawsons prediction the special
had lost more time before its arrival at the
end of the division and when haughes and
the  pulled out of manchester there
were exactly twenty-three minutes to make-
up

  it was a short run of fifteen miles to ge-
neva their only stop but it was a sharp up-
grade all the way haughes knew that un-
less  could hold her own for the distance
it would be difficult to make up much of the
time the engineer of the buffalo division
had lost

  from geneva to burdett is a distance of
thirty-five miles with a steady gradual rise
of approximately forty-two feet to the mile
but if  was steaming well as they pulled
out of geneva big jim had few fears
for this part of the run

  after burdett it was down-grade for the
thirty-nine miles to sayre the other end of
the division-a straight track with a single
bad curve it was on this stretch that
haughes counted to make up most of his
time

  seven minutes after leaving manchester
they passed through clifton springs with a
roar that wakened the echoes of that peace-
ful watering-place

  a glance at his watch told haughes that
his engine had made the five and a quarter
miles in schedule time while the indicator
showed that she still had plenty of pressure
in reserve he was saving it for he knew
that the next ten miles would be the hardest
of the run

  up and up they climbed with undimin-
ished speed as notch by notch big jim
coaxed his engine shrieking and protesting
like a living thing to the limit of her pow-
ers behind the fire - box stebbins toiled
with the light glowing ruddily upon his sweat
and grime streaked face more an automa-
ton than a man he seemed as with swift
certain movements he fed the fuel that gave
 her life and power

  through phelps and oaks corners they
sped while the station operators timing their
passing cheered them on wildly as they
entered the yards at geneva haughes again
looked at his watch and almost as he did so
brought the special to a stop before the sta-
tion they had gained one minute

  but here a delay was encountered a
large funeral-party waited on the platform
to board the special and a hasty glance at
the gage showed that  must have water
before another twenty miles or they would
lie in difficulties there was no alternative
it was directly against orders for any train
to tank up at geneva and it meant a thirtv-
day lay-off for any engineer or fireman
to violate this rule

  haughes and stebbins were out to make
up time a stop for a plug at any station
 miles in  minutes



beyond meant further loss and haughes did
not mean to stop this side of sayre

   i guess well have to chance it harry
he said to stebbins maybe well need a
months vacation after this trip anyway at
least well give those mourners-he indi-
cated the funeral cortege then slowly board-
ing the train -  enough excitement in the
next seventy-five miles to make em forget
what they came for

  stebbins grinned approvingly at his chief
with a twist of bis
hand the cool waters
gushed into the al-
most empty tank an
instant later haughes
pressed down the in-
jector and  fairly
hissed her gratitude

then with two pre-
paratory snorts when
the conductor gave the
go ahead signal
her drivers began to
revolve and she wss
off again for the last
and longest lap of her
killing race against
time

  they had gained a
minute in that record
climb from manches-
ter but what with the
funeral-party and the
necessary tanking up
this minute had been lost and five others
besides as they cleared the platform
haughes saw that the special was twenty-
eight minutes behind the schedule it was
now or never

  the  was steaming well but obviously
not yet doing her best as they passed
through varick seven miles out of geneva
not a second had been chipped off their hand-
icap haughes called to stebbins and a
moment later with a shower of glowing
sparks spouting from her stack the engine
responded to his hand

  at kendaia the next station they had
gained forty seconds at gilbert two min-
utes and at hector four stations beyond
the special had just twenty-three minutes to
make up - exactly where they had started
from manchester

  five miles beyond lay burdett and from
this point it would be easy running in the
next forty-four miles twent--three minutes
must be gained if human skill and daring
cor id accomplish it

   with a rush her flying wheels driving a
cloud of dust skyward the special thun-
dered through burdett with three minutes
clipped off the twenty-three that had bur-
dened her at hector haughes saw a little
knot of menon the platform under the sta-
tion lantern toss their caps into the air as
he approached

   after that haughes saw nothing but two
shining rails that glimmered and vanished
into the inky blackness far ahead he dared
not look aside

   trees and telegraph-
poles rocks fences
and hedges houses
with their gleaming
windows and white
twinkling mile-posts
all merged into one
indistinguishable blur

   in the coaches be-
hind sleep was im-
possible the funeral-
party and the other
passengers sat silent
or talked excitedly
together a prey to
nervous apprehension

  a hundred anxious
queries had been hurled
at the conductor until
at last he had sought
refuge in flight

   was there any dan-
ger was the train
running away had the engineer lost con-
trol of his engine or had he suddenly
dropped dead as they had heard engineers
sometimes did what possible excuse was
there for such excessive speed it was be-
yond the bounds of all reason what right
had a reckless engineer to imperil their lives
for the sake of a few minutes about which
nobody cared

   these and many other cjuestions were flung
at the conductor who replied as soothingly
and reassuringly as possible but never once
did his hand reach upward for the rope over-
head he knew big jim haughes and
fancied perhaps that even had he done so
his signal would have been ignored when
a train is late it is for the engineer to worry
not the conductor and big jim was out
to make up time realizing this and having
exhausted his diplomatic arts on the excited
passengers he wisely retreated

   up ahead in the cab ignorant of the tur-
moil behind him haughes was making rap-
id mental calculations the special was

 i wish dawson had picked some
other man


the railroad mans magazine

nearing van etten junction and between
that point and lockwood the next station
lay the most dangerous curve on the entire
division

  just around it was a block and a siding
neither of which could be seen until the
curve was completely cleared somewhere
between the special and sayre were two sec-
ond-class merchandise freights - symbol
trains-and the question in haugliess mind
was whether the had tried to make sayre
ahead of the special or had been held out
at the lockwood siding

  if the former was the case and the con-
ductors of the freights had every reason to
suppose they had plenty of time a collision
was almost inevitable everything rested
with the tower-man if he had not held
them out before  had rounded the curve
the special would be upon them yet if he
slackened speed by the smallest fraction
they could not make sayre on time

  in the flash of a moment haughes made
his decision

  there were thirteen miles-yet to go and but
nine minutes to make them in if the block
was clear he meant to make them but clear

or not he would not close his throttle
by a notch until he knew the 
was steaming as she had never
steamed before

 big j im  beckoned to his fire-
man the roar of the engine made
ordinary speech impossible

 harry he shouted close to
stebbinss ear using his hand as a
trumpet  give me the block-coming
into lockwood-from the other
side of the cab - with your -
lanterns 

    stebbins nodded and made
  ready from the opposite side
  of the cab the semaphore could
  be seen an instant before they
  cleared the curve

     as they left van etten junc-
tion three miles from the block
haughes opened up his whistle it
shrieked and reverberated up and
down the length of the valley - a
warning to the crews of the symbol
trains then hurrying into the lock-
wood siding that was not to be dis-
obeyed

not for an instant did the 
cease her discordant wailing until she
struck the curve only then did
haughes release his hold of the rope
shifting his gaze from the track
ahead to the figure of his fireman opposite
the next ten or twenty seconds would tell the
tale for both of them

  although it was the smallest fraction of
time it seemed an age to the waiting engi-
neer before stebbins gave the signal an in-
stant of tense watching and then-high
above the firemans head - flashed the red
lantern the block was up the freights
must be on the main track-dead ahead

  the cry on big jims lips crumbled
away to a whisper as instinctively his hand
shot out toward his levers but even as it
did so with a single spasmodic movement
stebbins jerked the red lantern downward
and swung the other savagely high against
the roof of the cab

  the block had cleared

  out of the cab of the  two angry faces
glared at the tower-man frantically waving
his green lantern while he still sought to
clear his fouled semaphore on the siding
the green tail-lights of the symbol trains
twinkled an instant as their crews cheered
big jim and the special racing past
they had reached the siding with hardly a
minute to spare
 miles in  minutes



  again s whistle shrilled a warning as
they neared the railroad crossing at east
waverley and as the special shot through
the two-mile-long yards at the junction it
sent forth a wild slogan of defiance and vic-
tory the race was over as the train rum-
bled into the station at sayre a crowd of
townspeople and railway officials waited on
the platform

   on time-to the second-with twenty-
eight minutes made up between here and var-
ick-best run ever made over the seneca di-
vision was the burden of their ejaculations

  haughes and the  had won as he
and stebbins clambered a little unsteadily
from the cab the crowd swarmed round them
with congratulations both seemed to be
dazed

   dont you know that youve broken all
records on the division-that you made the
last thirteen miles from van etten junction

in exactly nine minutes asked one of the
admiring group around haughes at a loss to
understand his silence

  big jim turned limply and wearily to-
ward the speaker he was thinking of the
symbol trains and the fouled semaphore

  yes i know it he rejoined hoarsely
of course i know it-but i dont care a
hang about it let me get out of here so
i can go somewhere and lie down im
tired

  in the morning however after a nights
rest when dawson congratulated him on the
run and informed him moreover that the
seneca division alone had brought the spe-
cial through on schedule i think you will
agree with me that big jim did care
more about it than he had previously ac-
knowledged especially when neither he nor
stebbins ever heard anything about their dis-
regard for orders in tanking up at geneva

firemen who study to save coal

another railroad to recognize the important
part that a school for firemen plays in keep-
ing down fuel expenses is the lehigh valley

  when a man is employed as fireman he re-
ceives a list of questions upon which he is ex-
amined at the end of his first year of service
later he receives another series for mastery during
his second year and then finally a third series for
his third year he is not expected however to
work out all the problems himself for several aids
have been established for him

  a copy of a book on fuel and steam economy is
put into the hands of every fireman who enters the
service of the company and regular instruction in
the operation of air-brakes is provided the man-
agement of the company has appointed assistant
road foremen whose special duty is to give in-
struction in the proper and economical use of fuel
moreover every fireman is invited to apply to the
master mechanic general foreman road foreman
of engines and the general air-brake and fuel in-
spector or to any other official for information
upon any matter in connection with his work

  when he takes the examination which forms
a part of the educational scheme the fireman must
make a high record to pass in the first two
series of questions an average of  per cent is
required and in the last series an average of 
per cent he may feel sure though that no
catch questions will be put forward to puzzle him
they will be all thoroughly practical here are a
few examples

  how should a fire be built up before starting
how often should fresh coat be applied to a fire
if a hole appears in a fire how should it be
treated

  state as fully as you can just when the blower

should be used what is the result if the blower
is left on too long

  in making station slops should a fresh fire be
put in at shutting off or at starting in ap-
proaching long down grades how should the fire
be handled

  should an injector be left on continuously
throughout a trip or be put on and shut off at
intervals what attention should a fire receive
when the injector is working what is a safety-
valve how does a safety-valve operate

 when and how often should the grates be
shaken  does an engine popping affect in any
way the amount of coal used per trip

  what effect does the stopping up of flues have
on a fire how can this be overcome

  if you should open a fire-door and discover a
dull or red fire what would you do why if
an engine burns the fire at one side or at the back
end of the fire-box what is wrong

  what is an ash-pan should air be admitted
to the grates through the ash-pan if a fire ap-
pears in an ash-pan what is the cause

  what is the object of a locomotive water-glass

  what is a clean fire

  what is the difference between a wide and a
narrow fire-box engine 

  what is a stray bolt what purpose does it
serve

  name all the important parts of the air-brake
equipment as applied to a locomotive what is
an automatic brake how is an automatic air-
brake applied how is it released

  what is meant by emergency position or an
emergency application what is the proper
method for bleeding off a brake what is meant
by cutting out a brake

               a most convenient party

       hes the man who gets the raggin when the things are out of
            joint

      and its mr roundhouse foreman is his name

  hes only just past forty

  but his hair is turning gray

  it happened in the six months hes been here

  we are confidently betting we can turn his mind astray
  by the time hes been the foreman for a year

  do you see those feet a wavin

  from that steam dome yes you bet

  theyre certainly a goin with a vim

  theres a delicate connection that no other man can get
  but the foreman-an those feet belong to him

 and from mornin until evenin

 and from evenin until dawn

 the same old cries are ringin in his ears

  say these tires on no  are as flat as any lawn

the new home for aged and disabled railroad men recently built at highland park illinois the portrait in the upper corner is that of

john okeefe the manager
a home for aged and disabled
railroad men

by frank s howe

the bugbear of helpless or infirm railroaders who have grown old in the
service of their companies or been rendered unable to earn a livelihood by
sickness or injury is no more the four great brotherhoods have united
for the protection of members who might become public charges in case mis-
fortune overtakes them the new home at highland park illinois will prove a
welcome haven to many who have been rendered incapable for work

    while a number of the railroads have adopted pension systems for the sup-
port of their veteran employees there are many cases where the old-timers are
not so well provided for and to them the home is indeed a blessing the fact
that there are only seventy-seven inmates in the new institution tells the remark-
able story of the ability of railroad men to keep their heads above the waters
of helplessness it indicates a tendency toward thrift of which any other class
of men might well be proud

what the brotherhoods have done to safeguard their aged comrades
against the rigors of fate in the helplessness
of old age

  who in the discharge of his duties as a
  physician discovered a member of his broth-
  erhood inthe almshouse of cook county il-
  linois

where the idea originated

     inspired by a desire to benefit the man who
  was ill and in need of assistance and ap-
  preciating the stigma cast upon his brother-
  hood by allowing one of its members to
  become an inmate of a public poorhouse he
  conceived the idea of establishing a home
  where members of all the brotherhoods might
  receive the comforts and care of a home when
  no longer able to withstand the hardships
  and exposure incident to their employment
  and perhaps with proper care and nursing
  be rendered able to take up some other line
  of industry

the plan was first adopted in dr ingallss
own home in chicago it met with almost
instant approval and success and during the
following year the modern physical require-
i

picturesque highland park
illinois twenty-three miles
nortli of chicago on the ma-
jestic bluffs overlooking lake
michigan stands a living
monument to the railroad
mans generosity - the new home for the
aged and disabled railroad employees of
america

  the society through whose efforts this
shelter for the helpless brothers of the rail
was built was organized in  its object
being to provide for worthy aged and dis-
abled railroad men who are members of the
four railway brotherhoods - namely the
brotherhood of locomotive engineers the
brotherhood of locomotive firemen and
enginemen the order of railway con-
ductors and the brotherhood of railroad
trainmen

  the original idea had its inception in the
mind of dr frank m ingalls a former rail-
road employee during the above-named year


the railroad mans magazine

ments and standards for railroad employees
having increased the number of indigents
among the ranks the home was permanently
installed in beautiful highland park

  the original home there consisted of sev-
eral wooden structures which housed the in-
mates for nearly nineteen years but in-
creasing calls for assistance and a perfect
understanding of its samaritan purposes by
the various brotherhoods made it possible
to dedicate the new  home on april

	of this year

a pleasant location

  the management and control of the home
is invested in a board of trustees made up of
representatives of each of the four railroad
organizations it covers about five acres of
land and is located at beech and st john
streets highland park the buildings face
the main-line tracks of the chicago and
northwestern railway and the chicago and
milwaukee electric railway

  sheridan road one of the greatest auto-
mobile boulevards in the united states con-
necting chicago and milwaukee is two
blocks east of the grounds and lake michi-
gan is only three blocks away the lake shore
at this point being a ninety-foot bluff from
the top of which an excellent view of the
lake and the passing boats is obtainable

  the home consists of two buildings-
the main structure containing the inmates
and attendants and the other the power plant
and laundry at the present time it sup-
ports seventy-seven inmates at a monthly
cost of about fourteen hundred dollars

the building arrangements

  the main building surrounded by a fine
grove of hard maple elm oak and hickory
trees contains three stories and a high base-
ment practically all above the ground built
in the form of the letter t the front

chapter xvii

in the little room

fust what happened between the two
men during the first ten minutes of
their stay in the little back-room in
joe smiths place we will chronicle
later suffice to say here smith
himself served their order after
which he carefully closed the door and went
on with his customary occupation of  pass-
ing the suds over the counter to satisfy the
seemingly unquenchable thirst of the patrons
of his place

  joe smith knew that something unusual
was going on to his method of thinking
 brown  taber was about to pull off a big
deal in the language of the east side he
had a  game bird  whom he intended to
roll joe smith knew browns ability
in this connection and if  brown  had
found a good one it meant that there would
be an increase in the receipts of the place-
for  brown  was indeed a spender when
he was in funds

  smith was in the act of mopping up his
wet bar when he turned his face to the door
and was surprised to see the latticed parti-
tions that hid it from the gaze of those in the
street open very slowly and very cautiously

  he looked at the newcomer with more than
surprise for as the latticed doors opened
wider and wider he saw that the person en-
tering was a woman

  the little gray dress looked somewhat fa-
miliar too and then as the whole body
emerged into view there stood  brown 
tabers mother

  she was very frightened she seemed to
stand on the threshold of the saloon as if it
were going to swallow her up as if she were

fearful that once the doors closed on her
she would be lost forevermore

  joe smith laid down his rag disregarded
the several orders that were hurled at him
by the men at the bar and came around to
where mrs taber was standing

  there was a wicked look in his eye he
knew that mrs taber had the respect of the
parish notwidistanding her sons terrible rec-
ord-that everybody in the neighborhood
loved her he knew that she had come for
her son but in die event of the big deal diat
was to be pulled off behind the closed door
he knew also that  brown  did not want to
be disturbed

  is  brown here was die little wom-
ans first question

  joe smith hesitated he wanted time to
think what could he do how could he
serve both he hated worse than anything
to lie to the little woman and on the other
hand if lie betrayed  brown the chances
were that  brown  would wind it all up by
punching his head

   is  brown  here  she asked again

  no said smith

  mrs taber looked at him he had never
before seen such an expression on her face
he wanted to withdraw his answer and tell
her the truth but for once his tongue stuck
to the roof of his mouth it was impossible
for him to utter what was in his mind

  joe she said hesitatingly joe and
then she faltered again  youre not telling
me the truth

  joe tried to stammer something but mrs
taber relieved him of further attempt

   tell me where he is i want him

  she scanned the idling bums gathered
around the bar she looked into every corner
in a vain of hope of seeing her son but he
was nowhere in sight

the railroad mans magazine

   she noticed the door leading to the little
room where he and blander were planning
their awful crime at first she thought that
she would muster up all her courage and
blaze a way to where her son might be but
something failed her

   the place was so filthy and the great un-
canny-looking men who were standing about
the bar gaping at her as if she had come to
demolish their pet resort added to her fright

  she thought for a moment that she would
go to father flynn and ask him to accompany
her back to the saloon but it flashed through
her mind that if she did so joe smith would
slip her son into the street and her quest
would be foiled

   she would remain there until  brownie 
was produced she would not budge an inch
until he came from his hiding-place

   i know that he is here joe and i must
stay here until he appears

   hadnt you better stand outside asked
joe

   no she answered  my boy is here
i know that he is in trouble and i want to
save him

  perhaps the many times that joe smiths
mother tried to save him from trouble flashed
through his mind then perhaps he was moved
by a sudden determination to atone for the
lie that he told however he went over to the
wall fetched a chair and brushed it off care-
fully most politely did he proffer it to the
little woman not knowing what was about
to happen she thanked him and sat down

   smith went over to the room where blander
and taber were still in conference and
knocked on the door

  there was no answer and he knocked
again

  there was still no answer he tried to
open the door only to find it locked

  joe smith rattled the door loudly again
and again he kicked it and pounded on it

   there was no sound from inside

  he turned to the crowd around the bar
he looked at mrs taber his face was
ghastly white

    give me a hand here boys he said

   mrs taber rose from her chair and walked
in the direction of the door her wildest
fears were now at a fever point what could
all this mean

   did  brownie  go in there she asked

   the last time that i saw him he went in
there said joe smith but it doesnt look
much like he was in there now however ill
find out in a minute

  with several strong men smith put his

shoulder to the door it gave a sagging
cracking sound and then opened

  smith was the first to enter he turned up
the dim gas-light and looked around while
the room quickly filled with the patrons of
the place

  mrs taber was well on the outside she
hadnt the strength to elbow her way by those
powerful men

  joe smith and his patrons who crowded
into the room saw something that made their
wood freeze and their marrow congeal

  there was only one man in the room

  he was not brown taber

  he was stephen blander alias bertrand
clivers of the great mainland system of rail-
roads-or all that was left of him

  he was dead his head was resting on his
arm and his body was stretched across the
only table of the room

  his throat was cut from ear to ear

  there was no sign of  brown taber

  the room showed no signs of a struggle
even the two glasses partly filled with beer
had not been upset but were standing on the
table just about where joe smith had placed
them-mute sentinels of some awful crime

  one of the strangers darted out of the
room scared beyond description shrieking
the one word

  murder

  his blanched face his awful cry as he
darted past mrs taber and into the street
told her that something terrible had hap-
pened and that her brownie was again in
trouble she sank back in the chair in a
faint joe smith with unusual presence of
mind and with more brute strength than he
imagined he possessed pushed the crowd
from the room and went over to mrs taber

    brown  went into that room to-night
with a man the man is in there dead and
 brown  lias vanished 

  he spoke quickly to her but she did
not hear all that he said for she had fallen
into a dead faint

  meantime the first man to cry out the news
and dash into the street continued to herald
the terrible tidings as he ran down the block
yelling murder at the highest force of
his voice

  two policemen were standing on the cor-
ner they came toward him and he fell
into their arms

   where   asked one

   corner saloon the man gasped

  take him along and lets see cassidy
said one of the officer- and the well-meaning
informant was dragged back to joe smiths
president of the line-



saloon to assure the officers that he had told
the truth

  when the police arrived they found the
place in a turmoil it was thronged with
men and in the midst of it all joe smith
was trying to administer some stimulant to
mrs taber while the crowd thinking that
she was the one who had met with foul play
crowded around her until she was almost
crushed

  the officers were obliged to use their night-
sticks to get to smith and mrs taber the
crowd merged and pushed and fought with
one another to get a point of vantage once
or twice some one said something insulting
to the officers and they were unmerciful with
their clubs

  several other policemen heard of the affair
and joined their brothers it was too much
for them however the crowd in the street
was increasing every moment and soon the
officers found themselves wedged in so tightly
that they were unable to move in either direc-
tion or in fact in any direction

  finally a citizen with more sense than the
rest of his kind rushed to a neighboring store
and telephoned for the reserves

  in a few minutes twenty men were on the
spot they formed a flying wedge so to
speak the new york police are the best-
trained men in the world when it comes to
handling a mob and soon the reserves had
forced their way to the entrance of joe smiths
saloon

  in a few minutes more they had cleared
it they drove the crowds half a block
from the place and then started to investi-
gate

  lieutenant groton in charge of the par-
ticular precinct of which joe smiths place
was perhaps the center soon rushed up in
his swift automobile

  he was one of the first to question joe
about the crime

  smith told the lieutenant the story as
quickly and briefly as possible explaining
mrs tabers presence he told it straight-
forwardly he had no one and nothing to
shield

  lieutenant groton noticing that mrs ta-
ber was swooning at intervals ordered her
to be conveyed to a hospital two officers
taking her in charge while they awaited the
ambulance

  the lieutenant then led the way into the
room and looked at the body of the dead
blander the officer was soon convinced that
it was murder

  where is  brown  taber he turned

sharply on joe smith as he asked the ques-
tion

   i dont know answered smith

  are you sure continued the lieutenant

   on -the body of my sainted mother re-
plied joe smith adding a few statements of a
similar nature to further establish his inno-
cence

  well ill have to take you in as a wit-
ness

  the officer beckoned to two of his men to
take joe smith in charge

  as they laid their hands on smith lieu-
tenant groton beckoned them to bring him
into the room where blanders body lay

   how do you suppose taber got out of
here asked the officer

  search me i dont know replied smith

  take him away ordered the lieutenant

  how did  brown  taber escape  that
was the all-important question how did
the man who was from all appearance re-
sponsible for that hideous crime get out of
that room unobserved and get away the
lieutenant wondered the policemen won-
dered and joe smith while being led off to
the detention pen in the tombs as the most
important witness in the case wondered more
than all the rest

chapter xviii

breaking the news

  n the following morning the newspapers
contained a startling item on their
front pages to the effect that the body of a
well-dressed man had been found in a back-
room of joe smiths saloon on the east side
with the throat cut from ear to ear

  nothing continued the newspaper nar-
rative was found on the dead man that
would lead to an identification and then fol-
lowed a minute description of blander-his
height the color of his eyes the cut of his
clothing and all the rest

  indeed the description was so very minute
that detective tom tracie while taking his
coffee in his humble harlem flat suddenly
dropped back in his chair and almost choked

  and jimmie winters sipping his coffee in
his washington square apartments wondered
if it didnt sound very much like his old
enemy blander

  and even vincent wilson on his way
down-town to the offices of the mainland sys-
tem in louisville was so much impressed by
the telegraphic report which he read in his
paper that he alighted from the car at the


ti-ie railroad mans magazine

nearest telegraph office and sent a wire to tom
tracie which read

have read despatch from xew york in

morning paper unknown man found murdered

  may be our man advise that you see

  but tracie didnt need any such advice
in fact he was on his way to the morgue to
see the body before wilsons telegram reached
him

  up to this time the only person connected
with this tragedy who had not been surprised
by the item in the morning paper was the
lady at the continental hotel on fifth ave-
nue who innocently believed that her right-
ful married name was mrs bertrand clivers

  it wasnt the custom for meriel to read the
newspapers with any degree of interest unless
it was the gossip of the social world or a
description of the latest gowns the long
and unbroken record of crime in all its
phases that kept the more sordid of the
metropolis in mental pabulum was to her
as tiresome as dead sea fruit if she did
notice the glaring head-lines the news had
made no impression on her

  tom tracie took one look at the body and
then hastened down to the office of the com-
missioner of policed that officer hadnt ar-
rived but his chief assistant was present
and to him tracie told the entire story of
the blander-clivers mystery winding up with
the information that the much-sought-for
financier -was now a corpse in the morgue
while the man who killed him had escaped

  in a short time this information was given
out to the associated press and was whirled
over the country shortly before nine oclock
vincent wilson was preparing some reports
for the division superintendents when a mes-
senger-boy appeared with a telegram it was
from tracie and it read

body of man you wired about is that of

  blander or clivers no due to his assailant

  president jones of the mainland system
was not due at his office until after ten oclock
but wilson couldnt wait until then to tell
him putting on his hat he rushed down to
the street hailed a cat and ordered the driver
to rush to the home of the big man which
was situated on the outskirts of the city

   im right im right i knew that i was
right he kept repeating over and over to
himself as the cab tore out to president
joness residence

  mr jones was standing in the large win-
dow of his home awaiting his motor-car which
took him to his office every morning

  he was surprised when he saw the cab
driving up and from the manner in which
the driver lashed his horse he knew that
something out of the ordinary had happened

  but when vincent wilson jumped out ran
up the steps and rang the bell he surmised
that something in the way of news regarding
the peculations of the trusted employee was
to be told him

  president jones met wilson at the door

  hes been found gasped wilson pro-
ducing the telegram

  who asked mr jones

   clivers or blander or whatever his name
is went on wilson found dead in the
back-room of an east side saloon in new
york with his throat cut the report is that
he was murdered but ill bet that he com-
mitted suicide 

  the president of the mainland system read
the wire carefully once twice perhaps a
dozen times before he uttered a word

  then he took the newspapers and glanced
at the head-lines and in order to go over the
whole thing as quietly and calmly as possi-
ble he called vincent wilson into his study
and there the two men went over every detail
of the matter so far as they knew the facts

   its our man all right said president
jones at length

  there can be no doubt about it wilson
spoke with all the excitement of a boy who
has found a new swimming-hole he had
done a big thing so he felt  he had been
instrumental in exposing blander and blan-
der fearing detection and a term in jail had
killed himself that was vincent wilsons
construction of the death of the man

  now wilson said president jones i
am going to send you to new york on this
matter i want you to take the first train for
the east and see tracie look at the body
and when you are sure that the remains are
those of-er-clivers-mr jones found it
difficult to get out of the habit of calling the
dead man by any other name save the one he
used as an officer of the mainland-then
as our representative have tracie take you
to the commissioner of police and tell him
all that you know about this case come to
the office first with me and i will give you a
letter that will serve to identify you in case
you need it

  by this time mr joness motor-car was at
the door wilson dismissed his cab and
jumped in with his superior officer during
the fast trip over tin thoroughfare to the
offices of the company mr jones told wil-
son that lie really had no doubt but that the
president of the line



right man had been found to protect the
companys interests in the person of vincent
wilson

    it took courage to do what you did said
the president  many a man would have
let it pass or would have held it against
clivers and blackmailed him but you
showed great courage and the company owes
you something that it is not going to forget to

pay-	

  thats all right said wilson the
satisfaction that i picked the right man is
glory enough for me

   armed with his letter of introduction wil-
son took the first train for new york but
long before he had reached the metropolis die
matter was public property

  in fact he read about it in the new york
newspapers that were brought aboard the
train so fast does news travel in these ad-
vanced times president jones had been in-
terviewed almost within two hours after the
departure of his trusted employee the
world knew the story it was on every tongue
and the manner in which the flame started
was this

  after wiring wilson tom tracie called
up jimmie winters and jimmie jumped in
a taxicab and drove over to the morgue
where tracie was awaiting him there he
identified the body and as the commissioner
of police had put the entire matter in the
hands of tracie he found it part of his duty
to notify the dead mans wife

   this pleasant detail even the detective dis-
liked but he knew that jimmie would be just
the person with his gentle manner and
diplomacy jimmie would break all the har-
rowing details to meriel in the most ap-
proved fashion

   jimmie didnt like the idea of going alone
so both agreed to go together

  jimmie sent up his card it was then
about eleven in the morning and meriel was
preparing for her morning canter in the park
she had been somewhat lonesome and the
prospect of talking to jimmie was most al-
luring just then meantime tracie had had
a whispered conversation with the manager
and the two men were allowed to go up to
meriels room

  she greeted jimmie with all the joy she
possessed

  it was evident that she was in ignorance
of the whole affair

  you have brought a friend she saw
tracie and she held out her hand with all
the old graciousness

  yes replied jimmie mr tracie

  tracie bowed the trio were seated in
the parlor of the suite and jimmie muster-
ing up all his courage broke the news

   we have come on a painful mission me-
riel he said as tenderly as possible  it is
about mr-mr-your husband

   meriel didnt betray the slightest emotion

  did you read this mornings papers
asked jimmie

   i glanced at them

  well jimmie went on mr tracie is
a member of the detective force of this city
and he has been trailing your husband for
some time last night he was found-
dead-

  dead  exclaimed meriel she fell over
in a heap the men quickly resuscitated
her

   tell me all about it she said when she
recovered

  they told her all-all they told her
everything they knew of the unfortu-
nate man they opened her eyes to die
most hideous fact that can come to a woman
-die fact that she was married to a thief
who was masquerading under another name
they told her too that she would be a fool
to shed one tear for him meriel decided
quickly that she wouldnt be a fool

  tracie left the room and jimmie was
alone with the woman he loved more than all
else in this world

  it was surprising how quickly meriel was
recovering in fact she was beginning to
hate the man she thought that despite his
peculiar ways he was honest but now the
mask had been removed the cloak torn from
his shoulders and though lie was dead he
was revealed to her in all the hideousness and
loadisomeness of his real self

   it is an awful scandal and i want you
to get away from new york until it blows
over said jimmie take a little trip
somewhere for a month or two and then go
back to your old home where we knew you
before that viper came into your life just
now the town is talking of nothing but
this man there are some who believe diat
he committed suicide-and if that is not
true then he was planning some awful crime
with die man who entered that saloon with
him

  meriel took the suggestion and departed
quietly before her connection with the affair
was aired in the papers it was aired too
in every possible manner and from every
standpoint her photographs were pub-
lished far and wide scores of reporters were
on her trail and dozens of newspaper pho-


the railroad mans magazine

tograpliers stood in front of her hotel for
days waiting for her to appear

  but meriel had slipped away far away
to a quiet retreat in the mountains

  and nobody knew where but jimmie

   i have decided on that was blanders
answer furthermore i have brought the
cash with me

  he took a long black wallet from his in-
side pocket and counted out just two hun-
dred twenty-dollar bills

   i thought that you would not care to
have it too large-that is the bills of too
large a denomination said blander as he
leisurely counted out the bills laying one on
top of the other while the hungry eyes of
brown taber feasted on them

  blander stacked them up nicely ran over
them a second time asking  brown  to
watch closely so as to detect any errors

  when both men were assured that the
amount of the first payment of the contract-
four thousand dollars-was correct blander
took from his vest-pocket a rubber band in-
cased the bills in it and handed them to
brown asking

  when can you do this

  now replied taber-right now
taber rose to his feet there was some-
thing unusual in his voice that startled
blander

 in a moment brown taber had
whipped out a knife

  in another moment he had sprung at blan-
der in another blander was forced against
the wall by the powerful thug and as he
raised his hands to heave-either in fright or
mute appeal brown brought the knife
across his throat

  blander went down in a heap striking the
table taber put out his mighty arm to
break the fall for he didnt want any sound
to be heard outside blander landed on the
table just as the police found him death
had come to him quickly there is no doubt
that in such moments the shock and surprise

caused by fright adds greatly to relieve the
suffering

  the one and only thing that taber want-
ed-the four thousand dollars in small
easily passed bills-was now his he had
never taken the commission of the crime pro-
posed by the dead man seriously but if
this old guy as he said to himself  is com-
ing around with four thousand in good
american casj im not going to pass him
by

   ill get it if i have to kill him said
 brown  to himself that night just before
he and blander had entered the saloon

  realizing that the man was dead taber
at once began his plan of escape it was
shrewd and well thought out he had the
money and he was going to some country
afar where his face was unknown he was
tired of the humdrum of the east side where
he was pointed out as the most prominent
crook within its borders to every slumming
party that happened along now he would
vacate for good

  once he thought of his mother mother
mother dear good kind little mother who
had never deserted him what would she
do she had begged him not to-he drew a
hand across his eyes for he wanted to blur
her from his mind just then perhaps when
he was settled in the new land she would
come to him-if-the shock didnt kill her

  but this was no time for sentiment moth-
er or no mother he must get out of that room

  the criminal is a criminal always what
is bred in the bone cannot be eliminated from
the mind lombroso that great italian who
devoted his whole life to a scientific study
of such men as brown taber tried to
tell just why a thief is always a thief the
fact is he cant help it

  it is born in him he must steal on the
same principle that lie must eat he must
kill on the same principle that he must
breathe the holiest sentiments of mother
of wife of family will not stay his hand a
moment once the idea seizes him

  brown taber looked around the room he
looked on the dead man lying there very
still he put the money in his pocket and
then he went through the clothing of the dead
and removed every vestige of paper that
would possibly serve as a clue to identifica-
tion

  he even tore the initials from the dead
mans hat and pulled a signet-ring from his
finger taber didnt want to leave the slight-
est trace

  then he turned the light very low ta-
president of the line



king the tray on which joe smith had served
the drinks he stepped over to the door and
opened it very cautiously about two inches
he looked steadily at smith and at the men
around the bar there were about a dozen
present but finally all departed but four
men who with joe smith made five

  one of them began a story and the others
leaned over the bar as it progressed in in-
terest their heads bent lower and they were
oblivious to all else at what seemed to be
the psychological moment taber opened the
door a little wider and sent the tin tray
crashing against the wall

  it landed with a loud clang and rolled
to the floor just as  brown  expected
smith and the five men hastened over to see
what had happened

   as they did so he slipped out and into the
street

  it all happened in the flash of a moment-
oh he knew so well just how the men would
act and how much time he would have to
make the street

  one turn of his head and it might all be
over he stepped onto the sidewalk just as
if nothing had happened he walked along
toward the bowery as if he were on some or-
dinary errand no one would have thought
that he was an escaping murderer with four
thousand dollars in his pocket

   only one of my trays said smith  it
must have fallen off the table come back to
the bar

   gee but it made some noise said one
of the men-and that was all that was said
about the incident then

  shortly after smith had proved his inno-
cence and promised to testify if ever
brown taber was caught-when he was
free to go back to his  joint  again-he fre-
quently wondered if that tray had really fall-
en from the table

    if  brown  used that business in his get-
away he frequently said  then he is a
better crook than i expected it was a pret-
ty slick piece of work and there were we
guys rubberin at the tray and  brown 
sneakin out of the door i wonder how much
he took off the fellow anyhow  

  when brown taber reached the bow-
en he started north he arrived at the
grand central station in time to catch a
train for chicago once in that city he
planted himself with a bunch of thieves
whom he knew

  they were all glad to see him and glad
to know that he had pulled off a successful
trick but after they began to read the

papers and to realize that  brown  must
have  landed  pretty well thev all wanted
a bit

   he began to see that if he made a  divvy
he would be minus the greater part of his
roll and then there was the trouble of some
dishonest crook squealing to the police
and ending his freedom

   above all there was that place in the un-
known land where he could pose as a decent
man and-send for mother

  so he started out anew this time he
struck out for the northwest notwithstand-
ing the fact that the police of every state
were on the lookout for him and his picture
had been brought to light in every rogues
gallery he managed to evade the sleuths

   with great skill he crossed the frontier
journeyed into canada and at vancouver
took the steamer for australia traveling in
the steerage as a miner bound for the gold-
diggings in the western part of that faraway
country

  it was a pleasant invigorating voyage
and it gave him time to think the chief
object of his thoughts was his mother he
wondered and wondered how she was getting
along and he hoped and he prayed that fa-
ther flynn would comfort her and that her
neighbors would not be unkind to her

   but what if the police should-molest her
thinking that she knew where he was and
what if the landlord should have her ejected
because of the notoriety

  he buried his face in his hands no he
would not think such thoughts the journey
would soon be over and he could send for
mother then she would come to him quiet-
ly and alone and he would give her a home
of which she would be proud

  the long sea trip was over and one day
 brown  found himself in the beautiful
harbor of sydney he went ashore and he
soon knew that he would like the rolonial
city it was a very sprightly place and the
people all seemed happy and it looked very
much like the american cities to which he
had been accustomed

   here he would settle he found work and
he gloried in the joy of honest labor for the
first time in his life he remained sober and
banked his stolen money he didnt want
to invest it until mother came for he wanted
her to help him put it where it would do the
most good

   after three months of the first honest life
that he had ever known he sat down and
wrote to her the note was couched in
plain and simple language he didnt want


the railroad mans magazine

to tell her too much it simply said  come
to me and it was unsigned but mother
would understand

  he waited and waited for an answer he
waited and waited and every time that the
steamer arrived from faraway america he
would go to die wharf and scan the faces
hoping to see the dear sweet smile of mother
as she leaned over the taffrail

  but modier never came and mother never
read the short missive bidding her to cross
the ocean she never recovered from the
awful shock of the murder two weeks
after she died in a delirium calling to her
 brownie  to be a good boy just as she called
to him when he was a little lad running
around the streets - a little mischievous
perhaps but her pride and joy her flesh and
blood

  the good priest never deserted her in her
last hours on earth he said a mass over her
body and the little church was crowded with
the people who loved her because she was a
good mother

  one day the postman came to father flynn
with a strange envelope addressed to mrs

the

 taber for the priest was her executor the
 postman wanted to know if father flynn
 as such would take the letter

   he took it and looked at it with a puzzled
 face he seemed to recognize the writing
  brown  had tried to disguise it but the
 familiar lines were thtfre

    yes i will take care of it said father
 flynn  so he is in australia he con-
 tinued as the postman went his way

   taking a pencil from his pocket he wrote
 across the envelope not here return to
 writer and deposited it in the nearest box

   it went back to australia-where it may be
 resting in the dead-letter office to this day

   some years after jimmie married the
beautiful meriel and gave her a name of
which she could be proud

   and some years later too vincent wilson
 became president of the line-the great main-
 land system

  and brown taber was lost in the
crowds that migrated to the new gold-mines
of western australia where he was swal-
lowed up in the hunt for the yellow metal

the coal that locomotives eat

according to a report recently made to the
 geological survey one-fifth of the coal mined
in the united states in  was burned in rail-
road locomotives at a cost of close to 
compared with the immense amount of coal that
is consumed annually for light heat and power in
the great cities and factory districts of this coun-
try this figure seems remarkably large but says
the erie employees magazine its principal signifi-
cance lies in the argument which its analysis makes
for the conservation of natural resources

  professor w f m goss dean of the university
of illinois who conducted the experiments reports
s

the railroad mans magazine

that of the  tons of coal the railroads
used in   tons are lost through the
heat and gases discharged from the stacks of the
locomotives  tons through cinders and
sparks  tons through radiation leakage
of steam and water sso tons through un-
consumed fuel in the ashes and  tons
through the incomplete combustion of the gases

   moreover is tons are consumed in start-
ing fires in moving the locomotives to their trains
in backing trains into or out of sidings and in
keeping locomotives hot while standing

the night and the storm fell together upon the old
      town of dundee

and trembling the mighty firth river held out its
       cold hand toward the sea

like the dull-booming bolts of a cannon the wind
swept the streets and the shores

it wrenched at the roofs and the chimneys it
crashed gainst the windows and doors

like a mob that is drunken and frenzied it surged
through the streets up and down

and screamed the sharp shrill cry of murder
oer river and hill-top and town

it leaned its great breast gainst the belfries it
perched upon minaret and dome

then sprang on the shivering firth river and tor-
      tured its waves into foam

look the moon has come out clad in splendor the
      turbulent scene to behold

she smiles at the nights devastation-she dresses
      the storm-king in gold

away to the north ragged mountains climb high
      through the shuddering air

they bend their dark brows oer the valley to read
       what new ruin is there

along the shore-line creeps the city in crouching
      and sinuous shape

with crc-sidcs so soon to be darkened and doors
      to be shaded with ctape

to the south like a spider-web weaving there
      curves for a two-mile away

this worlds latest man-devised wonder-the far-
      famous bridge of the tay

it stretches and gleams into distance it creeps the
       broad stream oer and oer

till it rests its strong delicate fingers in the palm
       of the opposite shore

but look through the mists of the southward there
       flash to the eye clear and plain-

like a meteor thats bound to destruction - the
      lights of a swift-coming train

mid the lights that so gaily arc gleaming yon city
       of dundee within

is one that is waiting a wanderer who long oer
      the ocean has been

his age-burdened parents are watching from the
      window that looks on the firth

for the train that will come with their darling-
      their truest-loed treasure on earth

hell be cornin the nicht says the father for
       sure the handwritins his ain

the letter says  ha the lamp lichted-ill come
      on the seven oclock train

for years in the mines ive been toiling in this
      wonderfu west oer the sea

my work has brought back kingly wages-theres
      plenty for you an for me

so sit ye an wait for my coming ye will na
      watch for me in vain

an see me glide over the river along o the roar o
       the train 

so they sit at the southernmost window the parents
      with hand clasped in hand

and gaze oer the tempest-vexed waters across to
      the storm-shaken land

they see the bold acrobat-monster creep out on
      the treacherous line

its cinder-breath glitters like star-dust-its lamp-
       eyes they glimmer and shine

it braces itself gainst the tempest it fights for
      each inch with the foe

with torrents of air all around it-with torrents
      of water below

but look look the monster is stumbling while
      trembles the fragile bridge-wall

they struggle like athletes entwining-then both
      like a thunder-bolt fall

down down through the dark the train plunges
      with speed unaccustomcd and dire

it glows with its last dying beauty-it gleams like
      a hailstorm of fire

no wonder the mother faints dead-like and clings
      like a clod to the floor

no wonder the man flies in frenzy and dashes his
      way through the door

he fights his way oul through the tempest he is
      beaten avid baffled and tossed

he cries  the trains gang off the tay brig
      lend hrlp here to look for the lost

oh little to him do they listen the crowds to the
       river that flee

the news like the shock of an earthquake has
      thrilled through the town of dundee

out out creep two brave sturdy fellows oer dan-
       ger-strewn buttress and piers

they can climb gainst that blast for they carry
      the blood of old scotch mountaineers

hut they leave it along as they clamber they mark
      all their hand-path with red

till they come where the torrent leaps bridgeless-
      a grave dancing over its dead
on the editorial carpet



a moment they gaze down in horror then creep
      from the death-laden tide

with the news theres nae help for our loved
      ones save gods mercy for them who have
      died  

the morning broke bright with the sunshine and
      the firth threw its gold glances back

while yet on the heart of the people deaths cloud
      rested heavy and black

and the couple who waited last evening their man-
 statured son to accost

now laid their heads down on the table and
     mourned for the boy that was lost

twas sae sad moaned the crushed aged mother
      each word dripping oer with a tear

 sae far he should come for to find us and then
      he should perish sae near

oh robin my bairn ye did wander far from us
      for mony a day

and when ye ha come back sae near us why could
      na ye come a the way  

i hae come all the way said a strong voice and
a bearded and sun-beaten face
smiled on them the first joyous pressuie of one
long and filial embrace

i cam- on last night far as newport but maggie
      my bride thats to be

she ran through the storm to the station to get
      the first greetin o me

i leaped from the carriage to kiss her she held me
      sae fast and sae ticht

the train it ran off and did leave me i could na
      get over the nicht

i tried for to walk the brig over-my head it was
      a in a whirl-

i could na-ye know the sad reason-i had to go
      back to my girl

i hope yell tak kindly to maggie-shes promised
      to soon be my wife

railroad facts and figures

we have received a copy of  the railway
library an interesting volume on rail-
road statistics containing many valuable reports on
the progress and operation of the great systems of
this country during the past year the work was
compiled by slason thompson manager of the
bureau of railway news and statistics in chi-
cago

  besides containing numerous figures and data
on every phase of railroading imaginable the book
presents addresses and reports of some of the fore-
most railroad executives of america in which their
best views on transportation problems are set forth

  railroad men who enjoy keeping up to date on
these matters will find the railroad library a
valuable book it not only contains a large fund
of information but the subject-matter is so well
arranged that it is also valuable as a reference

despatching by phone

editor thf railroad maxs magazine 

in your july number you published an article on
train-despatching by telephone i believe some
of the statements therein are erroneous the
article states that the telephone minimizes the
danger of mistakes in the transmission and receipt
of train orders in the morse code of telegraph
each and every letter is distinctly different when
spoken through a telephone the letters b c
d c  g p t v and z sound
very similar and in many cases it is very diffi-
cult to distinguish between them on this i base
my claim that the telegraph is safer than the tele-
phone

  now in regard to speed the articlc says that
a despatcher using the telegraph has his speed re-
stricted to accord with the receiving ability of
the operators i cannot see that he is rid of this
restriction where the telephone is in use a first-
class operator can copy a telegraphic order just as
fast as he can write can he do more with the

telephone i know of one despatcher now using
the telephone who claims he can handle three tele-
graphic orders in the same time he uses for one
with the telephone

the article claims that on one road during two
years of train-despatching by telephone not a
single accident was caused by mistakes in train
orders i fail to see anything remarkable about
that on the road which employs me i cannot
recall an accident caused by a mistake in the trans-
mission or receipt of telegraphic train orders in
the past seven years

 if the telephone is to take the place of the tele-
 graph it will not be for the sake of safety but to
 reduce expenses-a h w erie pennsylvania

views of that publication on train-despatching by
telephone

as to our personal view we do not believe that
the telegraph operators need fear that they are
destined to extinction by the introduction of this
new method any more than the engineer need
fear that the electric-motor will deprive him of
his work some roads will adopt the new scheme
of telephoning but there will always be a place
for the  opr in the great compound of rail-

bill masons bride

by bret harte

half an hour till train-time sir

    an a fearful dart time too

take a look at the switch lights tom

    fetch in a stick when youre through

on time well yes i guess so-

    left the last station all right

shell come round the curve a flyin

    bill mason comes up to-night

you know bill no hes engineer

    been on the road all his life-

ill never forget the mornin

    he married his chuck of a wife

twas the summer the mill hands struck-
   lust off work every one

they kicked up a row in the village

    and killed old donovans son

bill hadnt been married moren an hour

    up comes a message from kress

orderin bill to go up there

    and bring down the night express
on the editorial carpet



   he left his gal in a hurry

   and went up on number one

   thinking of nothing but mary
   and the train he had to run

   and mary sat down by the window
   to wait for the night express

   and sir if she hadnt a done so

   shed been a widow i guess

   for it must a been nigh midnight
   when the mill hands left the ridge

   they came down-the drunken devils
   tore up a rail from the bridge

   but mary heard em a workin

   and guessed there was something wrong-

   and in less than fifteen minutes
   bills train it would be along

   she wouldnt come here to tell us

   a mile-it wouldnt a done

   so she jest grabbed up a lantern

   and made for the bridge alone

   then down came the night express sir

   and bill was makin her climb

   but mary held the lantern

   a swingin it all the time

   well by jove bill saw the signal

   and he stoped the night express

   nd he found his mary cryin

   on the track in her weddin-dress

    cryin an laughin for joy sir

   an holdiri on to the light-

   hallo heres the train-good-by sir

   bill masons on time to-night

texas in this connection i will cite a longer

section of track without a single curve it is on
the mexican central division of the national rail-
ways of mexico on their line from monterey

locomotive percentages

editor the railroad mans magazine 

in your august number page  in reply to
e r parsons kansas you say you never
heard of locomotive percentages there are
some roads that have a kind of percentage rating
that e r may have in mind

  their tonnage is based on the maximum load
their largest engine can handle over the maximum
grade this engine is called a -per-cent engine
and the various lighter types would range down-
ward something like  per cent  per cent or
what they might figure to the smallest which
might be a -per-cent engine

  if they subsequently bought a larger type it
would be known as a -per-cent engine or what-
ever it figured until such time as they saw fit to


the railroad mans magazine

rearrange the percentages in terms of their newest
and heaviest type

  these percentages are of use during inclement
weather to figure various types of power from one

credulity

 suppose said the fireman rubbing the grime
from off his dark complexion

 suppose you were trying to make up time

and not a tank on the section 

and suppose that the water was down to three
and team vas tanding pat

with the gage somewhere up in high  g -

whats done in a case like that

 done   smiled the lofty engineer

id just haul open the throttle

ive run a train on a bottle of beer

and then thrown in the bottle

theres engineers on passenger-trains
thats made up time on a flask

its only a natter of pluck and brains-

but tell me why did-you ask

because said the fireman rubbing his nose
and giving the shovel a yank

i think by the way she snorts and blows

theres not a drop in the tank

and now old man i would like to see
a becr-bottle start her pump

heres one that the section boss gave me-

now work it or else you jump

one bound and the lofty engineer
went out of that engine van

and when he struck it didnt appear
which was the chief end of man

 i hope the grimy fireman said

as he opened the throttle wide

i hope he isnt really dead-

but im engineer if he died

left-over meats made appetizing

cookery hints that enable you to serve a satisfying hot dinner instead of a co lunch

by mary jane mcclure

many housekeepers look helplessly at the
cold roast beef lamb etc  left after the
first meal they know that the family
will not relish a dinner made from its cold slices
but dont know what else can
be done with it

  take a lesson from the
skillful and thrifty german
cook and provide yourself
with a jar of armours ex-
tract of beef then rejoice
when your roast is large
enough to provide for a
second dinner for without
labor you may serve a savory

meat dish more delicious than the original

  rub a teaspoonful of butter and a tablespoon
of flour together in a saucepan adding a cup of
hot water and finally a quarter of a tea spoonful of
the beef extract use a light hand for armours
extract is the strongest made and it is easy to

get in too much chop or slice your meat and
drop it into this rich sauce and let it get thoroughly
hot serve with french fried potatoes and see if
your family dont vote you a veritable chef

    any left-over meat is deli-
cious served in this way
roast beef mutton lamb or
veal even chicken or game

   foreign cooks know the
virtue of armours extract
of beef and would not dream
of trying to do without it
it is one of the secrets of
setting an economical table
while appearing lavish

   it gives richness and flavor to the cheaper
cuts of meat-saves boiling meat for soup stock-
is the basis of rich gravies and sauces remember
that a little goes a long way-it is the concentrated
beef essence - the strength and flavor that you
cook out

   four times as strong as the ordinary
-the touch that gives sauces gravies and
soups an inimitable flavor send for

that teaches you the secrets of ap-
petizing cookery save the metal

a living from poultry

 from  hens in ten months on a
city lot  feet square

jo the average poul-
tryman that would
seem impossible and
when we tell you that
we have actually done a
spoultry business
with  hens on a cor-
ner in the city garden
 feet wide by  feet
long we are simply
stating facts it would
not be possible to get
such returns by any one
of the systems of poul-
try keeping recom-
mended and practiced
by the american peo-
ple still it can be ac-
complished by the

philo
system

the philo system is unlike all other wavs of keeping poultry

and in many respects just the reverse accomplishing things
in poultry work that have always been considered impos-
sible and trotting unheard-of results that are hard to be-
lieve without seeing

the new system covers all branches of the work necessary
for success

from selecting the breeders to marketing the product it
tells how to set eggs that will hatch how to hatch nearly
every egg and how to raise nearly all the chicks hatched
it gives complete plans in detail how to make everything
necessary to run the business and at less than half tiiecost
required to handle the poultry business in any other manner

tffo-pound broilers in eight weeks

are raised in a space of less than a square foot to the broiler
without any lossand the broilers arc of the very best quality
bringing here  cents a pound above the highest market price

oltt six-month-old pullets are laying at the rate of 
eggs each per month

in a space of two square feet for each bird no green cut
bone of any description is fed and the food used is inex-
pensive as compared with food others are using

our new book tin philo systkm ok pqcitry keeping
full particulars regarding phese wonderful discoveries
v ith simple easy to understand directions that are right to
the point and  pages of illustrations showing all branches
of the work from start to finish

dont let the chicks die in the shell

  one of the secrets of success is to save all the chickens
that are fully developed at hatching time whether they can
crack the shell or not it is a simple trick and believed to
be the secret of the ancient egyptians and chinese which
enabled them to sell the chicks at  cents a dozen

chicken feed at  cents a bushel

  our book tells how to make the best green food with but
little trouble and have a good supply any day in the year
winter or summer it is just as impossible to get a large
egg yield without green food as it is to keep a cow without
hay or fodder

our new brooder saves  cents on each chicken

  no lamp required no danger of chilling over heating
or burning up the chickens as with brooders using lamps or
any kind of lire they also keep all the lice off the chick-
ens automatically or kill any that may be on them when
placed in the brooder our book gives full plans and the
right to make and use them one can easily be made in
an hour at a cost of  to  cents

love at first sight

     note-pictures now ready for delivery

   why so much frowning asked a friend as he
 paused at the door of the writers office

     because i cant find the right words to tell the maga-
 zine readers how really beautiful and valuable are the
  i  pompeian beauties in colors you see each pom-
 peian beauty is really worth  to  i replied

   oh i see he laughed cant make the public under-
 stand how you can give a   picture in colors for 
 cents eh well charge em a dollar maybe that will
 make em sit up and observe lets see the pictures i
 pointed to the wall behind him those those for 
 cents apiece his voice indicated his own unbelief

   there you are   laughed wont believe me your-
 self just  cents apiece but which is your choice

  that one for me  he said  no wait a
 moment that one no i-i--say- loveem all
 theyre great theyre wonderful just say in your ad
 that its a case of love at first sight for every single one of
 them they are all heart-breakers if the public could only
 see them in their real sizes and colors youd be swamped

    yes it is a case of love at first sight for those who
 see them in their true and exquisite colors then the
 question is which  pompeian beauty would you rather
 have on your walls any one is worthy of a fine frame
 yes you may order several if you cant decide on one
 you run no risk read our money back guarantee

   why  is not charged  the manufacturers of
 pompeian massage cream want to make you so delighted
 with each picture you get that you can never forget who
 gave it to you for each picture is practically a gift the
  cents being charged to protect ourselves from being

pompeian

 overwhelmed we get our reward through years to
 come and from the good will and confidence thus
 established you get your reward at once

 appointed we will return your money
