 the tiger in house gargle listerine drawn from life by dan smith do you know do you know that the true cause of colds is now believed by many scientists to be a virus so fine that it passes through filters which retain the  ordi-
nary germs frequently associated with
colds these germs and the virus itself
lodge in the mouth nose and throat

you call it a cold but physicians call it the
tiger in the house their experience teaches
them how potentially dangerous a cold really is

  for this universal ailment often results in pro-
longed ill-health and sometimes death

  unchecked it runs through entire families un-
less treated it frequently leads to sinus ear and
mastoid as well as bronchitis and pneumonia
particularly in the case of babies  of acute
illnesses in children up to  are due to respiratory
infections every year colds cause industry a
loss estimated to be between  and


  and how does a cold gain entrance to the body
largely through the mouth and nose of course
bacteria enter and breed by millions it there-
fore becomes evident that daily oral hygiene is an
absolute necessity

over a period of more than  years the anti-
septic found best suited to this purpose is lis-
terine its results are a matter of record

  listerine is fatal to germs including those associ-
ated with colds it is non-poisonous it does not
irritate delicate tissue as many mouth washes do

  for oral cleanliness and to fight colds gargle
with listerine every morning and night if you
feel a cold coming on or one has already started
repeat the gargle every two hours you will be
delighted to find how often it brings relief

  the moment listerine enters the mouth it
begins to kill germs even four hours after its use
reductions in the number of germs ranging to 
have been noted numerous tests we have
conducted have shown that twice-a-day users
of listerine contracted fewer and milder
colds than those who did not use it lambert

   a new kind of pipe

 ner pipe incorporates radically dif-
 ferent principles of pipe constr action
 which eliminate the objectionable features long associated
 with pipe smoking

 a clean healthy smoke the smoke is drawn down

 through the special fframi filter
 which absorbs the wet unheal thy
 substances and toxins preventing
 them from being drawn into the
 mouth

 a cool dry smoke traveling
 up and down through the fluted
 passages of the filter the smoke
 is dried and cooled as well as
 cleansed the result is real pro-
 letttun for the throat tongue and lungs

 an economical smoke tobacco burns to the last shred
 is cool and sweet to the last puli no hidden corners in a
 buttner to collect impurities every part easily accessible

                          for cleaning the buttner
                 	pipe has a flat base to the

	jfc	bowl enabling the smoker to

                           set it down without spill-

 conic sections

 by t ogonor sloane phd

a point as a scientific conception
is defined as location without size
or space it may be taken as
the origin or starting point of meas-
urements and dimensions it is non-di-
mensional space which is a sort of
contradictory way of putting it but it
sometimes happens that contradictions
do explain things

  so starting with our point suppose we
move it along and its trace or track is
left after it as it proceeds this gives
us a line which taken in the abstract
has length and nothing else it may be
entitled space of one dimension for it
has no width or height now move the
line along in a direction other than that
of its length and it gives us a plane
which has length and width but no
thickness therefore it is space of two
dimensions a good deal of use has

been made of the conception of the
plane and of a two dimensional being
who could be imprisoned by laying a
thread in a closed figure around him

  next we may move our plane in any
direction other than either that of its
length and breadth this gives a third
dimension and we have a solid we are
three dimensional beings our surround-
ings are three dimensional and we seem
to have reached the limiting number of
dimensions it requires a vivid imagina-
tion to formulate a four dimensional
object but the effort is a frequent one
and we find the attempt made to depict
a four dimensional solid or ultrasolid
which is called a tessaract this word
is derived from the greek word for
four it is perfectly fair to pro-
nounce the effort a failure in its result-
the tesseract tells nothing
conic sections



  when it comes to defining four di-
mensional space the fourth dimension is
sometimes entitled space-time but that
does not tell us much in paradise
lost milton describes the fallen angels
as discussing free will fixed fate
foreknowledge absolute and says they
find no end in wandering mazes lost
this is substantially what happens to us
when we try to figure out a four dimen-
sional object we cannot conceive of it
nor picture it to ourselves it transcends
imagination

  if we think of a plane of limited area
attached to an axis and turned around
it a curved surface would be formed-
generated if we employ more scien-
tific terminology-whose shape would
depend on the contour of the plane and
the surface would enclose a volume
thus we get a three dimensional ob-
ject from a two dimensional surface by
simple rotation surfaces thus formed
and the solids they enclose are called
respectively surfaces of rotation and
solids of rotation or revolution thus a
sphere is a solid of rotation generated by
rotating a circle about its diameter

  all that we have given may seem ele-
mentary but it is precisely the elements
which so many of us fail on a globe
or a billiard ball is simple enough to
look at but how often do we picture
their generation by the rotating of circles
around their diameters the most ordi-
nary objects we meet with have their
individual stories to tell us the very
elements of our knowledge give the
basis for an expanding amount of true
science a great proportion of which is
completely missed by too many of us

  figure in your imagination a right
angle triangle standing on its base and
rotated completely around with its ver-
tical side as its axis it will generate
a solid which is a cone and this is the
basis of three very important curves
called conic sections it would be in-

teresting to know what proportion of
us could tell what conic sections are
we may start with the simplest

  let a plane intersect a cone cut
through it being perpendicular to its
axis or what is the same thing parallel
to its base the surface thus formed
will obviously be a circle and is the
first or simplest we may call it of the
conic sections webster refers to it
as a special case of the ellipse now if
the plane cutting across or intersecting
the cone is out of parallel with the base
and yet not parallel with its side it
gives an ellipse in everyday phrase
this is often called an oval which is
quite incorrect an ellipse is like a
prolonged or drawn out circle and is
perfectly symmetrical while an oval is
one sided it is of the shape of the
longitudinal section of an egg by a
plane through its longer axis the oval
is therefore of smaller contour at one
end than at the other and is named
from the latin word ovum meaning an
egg but our friend websters un-
abridged passes up as they say the
word oval accepting it as the pop-
ular name for an ellipse

  if the plane intersecting the cone is
inclined a little more so as to be par-
allel to its side a curve is produced one
which is closed at one end and open at
the other no matter how large the cone
may be this is a parabola now let
the intersecting plane be parallel to the
axis of the cone and to one side of it
and we have the hyperbola another open
curve

  these are the historic and classic conic
sections taking the circle as an ellipse
three of them are all that can be pro-
duced there is more than dry mathe-
matical interest in them the ellipse
has been used in the design for the
archcs of stone bridges there is a
method of drawing an approximate el-
lipse using bits of circles or arcs thereof


amazing stories

so as to get an approximation to the true
curve but this false ellipse as it is
called is considered to give an inferior
architectural effect when compared with
the true ellipse

  waterloo bridge across the thames is
one of the glories of london and of the
great architect john rennie this gives
the effect of the ellipse in bridge con-
struction yet the beautiful structure wras
threatened by the powers that be with
improvement in the shape of destruc-
tion and tearing it down until london
rose in arms and now it is to be pre-
served

  another interesting thing to be noted
in speaking of the ellipse is that the
planets in the solar system follow the
curves of ellipses in their paths around
the great luminary carrying out several
curious laws in their courses through
space

  the line drawn from the center of
a circle to its periphery is called its
radius in the ellipse there are two
such lines and they must be spoken of
as radius vectors the radius of a circle
properly speaking is a radius vector
but the last word is omitted when re-
ferring to it now the earth in follow-
ing its orbit around the sun pursues an
elliptical path the radius vectors of an
ellipse there are two of them meet at
all points on its circumference and our
earth as it were takes the two radius
vectors along with it but appropriates
one of them to itself so that its motion
is referred to only one of them and
this radius vector varies in length as it
goes through the three hundred and
sixty degrees of its course through
space around the sun the rate of mo-
tion or speed of the earth varies-its
speed is greatest when the radius vec-
tor is shortest

  and here comes the amazingly simple
law telling us that the radius vector of
the earth and radius vector of each of

the planets alw-ays sweeps over equal
areas in equal times thus a planet
moves over more degrees when the
radius vector is short than when it is
long and thus is subject to the sim-
plest kind of a law

  and again we meet another amazingly
simple law of the motion of the planets
which is approximately exact the
square of the time of revolution of a
planet around the sun is proportional to
the cube of its mean distance from the
great luminary suppose a planet is
three times as far from the sun on the
average as we terrestrials are the
cube of three  x  x  is
twenty-seven therefore the square root
of twenty-seven which we may take as
five and two-tenths would be the length
of the planets year taking the earths
year as one or we may multiply 
by  to get the length of the assumed
planets year approximately

  simple as these laws are there are al-
ways annoying fractions to be encounted
the earths year is not exactly v
days in length and the relative distance
of the planets from the sun are in de-
cidedly fractional proportions one to
the other

  the ellipse not only is a beautiful
curve for an arch but it tells us one of
the laws of motion of the planets
through space it appears in archiec-
ture and in astronomy two widely sepa-
rated subjects

  if a plane is supposed to pass through
a sphere it will always cut out a circle
the cone as we have seen may give any
one of three figures when cut by plane
if we take the circle as a special case
of the ellipse but the sphere gives only
one i f the plane is passed through
an equator or any other part of the
sphere where it is of largest diameter
it gives what is called a great circle
this brings before us a curious bit of
simplicity in geometry the outside area
conic sections



of a sphere is equal to the area of four
great circles if you had an absolutely
spherical or round apple and cut it
into two equal pieces the areas of the
two cuts would be equal to the area of
the outer surface of one of the halves of
the apple

  as a contrast to this the factor by
which the diameter of a circle must be
multiplied to give the circumference has
never been calculated to its end it is 
followed by a decimal which has been
carried to over one hundred figures with
no hopes of reaching the last one

  we may go back to miltons fallen
angels and say that we find no end in
wandering mazes lost probably the
decimal in question is without end

  the parabola possesses some features
of interest outside of its mathematical
relations if a projectile were dis-
charged in a horizontal direction in a
vacuum and subjected to the pull of
gravity it would follow a parabolic
course as it descended to the earth a
marble swept off a table by a cane or
otherwise in its fall to the floor will
follow a virtually parabolic curve it
has the resistance of the aid to modify
the parabola but its motion is so slow
that this does not affect it to any ex-
tent in the case of an artillery projec-
tile the resistance of the air counts for

a great deal because of the high velocity
involved and the curve followed departs
from the true parabola and is entitled
the ballistic curve

  if a cord cable or chain is attached to
two separated places on the same level
it will hang down in a loop forming a
curve known as a catenary or a chain
curve now suppose the cable sustains
an evenly distributed load referred to its
span and which load is so heavy that
the weight of the cable has no perceptible
effect it will take the parabolic curve
a suspension bridge never has either a
true catenary or a true parabola for the
line of its cable but a cross between the
two a sort of mixture the heavy road-
way pulling the suspending cables to-
wards a parabolic curve

  there is a horizontal factor in the pull
which a cord produces when thus at-
tached the straighter the cord the
greater will the pull be in the words
of bishop berkeley a famous philos-
opher with theories of his own there
is no force however great can stretch
a cord however fine into a horizontal
line which shall be absolutely straight
quoted from memory this is ab-
solutely true the story goes that the
good bishop never meant to be poetical
in writing the above he is said to have
dropped into verse unconsciously

qats ye

by harl vincent

we have all read about the fourth dimension a great deal has been written
about it either in fiction or seriously and we have here a true mystery story
based on the scientific conception of higher dimensions these conceptions
are woven into one of harl vincents best efforts and not content with the
fourth dimension he even speaks of higher ones the reader will find that
the story is very interesting and that a difficult subject is carried out to a

very successful end

chapter i

a mysterious stone

when jim wyatt first
saw the thing cuddled
in that grimy palm he
grinned and shook his
head he knew all these
old tricks of the panhandlers saw only
that a most decrepit representative of
that breed was trying to sell him a bit
of colored glass

  about to pass on wyatt was arrested
by the desperate entreaty in the wizened
face and the violent trembling of the
hand laid on his arm there was a curi-
ous look in the nighthawks eyes an
awful fear it was that lurked in those
watery optics stark terror almost

  only half a buck mister the old
fellow whined

  wyatt laughed sheepishly and reached
into his pocket you win he chuckled
heres a dollar but i dont want the
thing better keep it for the next
sucker

  no mister you keep it its worth
sumpin im tellin yuh plenty an
thanks fer th buck

with that the astonishing old street

arab thrust the smooth hard object into
wyatts hand letting go of it as if it
burned his fingers and then shambling
off rapidly into the shadows of wash-
ington street

  a queer sense of belief in the things
worth came to wyatt with his handling
of the stone not that he thought it so
intrinsically valuable but there was an
uncanny light in the brown-gold depths
of it like the stare of a basilisk sin-
ister cunning was in its gleam and
witchery it was a tigers eye looking
up at him with hypnotic gaze

  shivering unaccountably he shoved
the stone in his pocket it had seemed
almost that the mild breeze from off the
hudson took on a sudden chill and
the rumble of an elevated train over on
greenwich street shattering the mid-
night quiet of downtown new york
came as a distinct shock to his nerves
he shouldnt be working this late he
knew especially on the inventory of
his repair parts stock it was enough to
drive any man to mad imaginings

  he shrugged off the strange feeling
that had come over him and turned his
steps once more toward the subway at
cortlandt street

  a pistol shot roared out of the shad-
cats eye



others of the red men came from nowhere seeming to spring up from the
very floor and he was carried kicking and struggling vainly


amazing stories

ows he had left behind a half-human
cry followed ending in a horrible gur-
gle there came the shrill notes of a
police whistle and voices shouting the
thunderous exhaust of a powerful car
wyatt stopped in his tracks

  and then a whimpering sobbing crea-
ture in tattered clothing stumbled into
the light it was the old derelict wyatt
had befriended and he was clutching at
his throat with writhing fingers his eyes
popping from their sockets

  beat it mister he croaked
theyre after it the yellow stone
theyll get yuh sure tottering then
his face purpling he collapsed on the
sidewalk and lay still

  a burly policeman hove into view and
took in the situation at a glance with
deft fingers he loosened the mans scant
clothing and straightened out his limbs

  dead he pronounced rising and
facing wyatt who stood rooted to the
spot scared to death looks like
scared wasnt he hurt there was
a shot shaken by the experience and
much mystified wyatt stared foolishly
at the officer

aw i shot over the heads of a
couple of guys that was maulin
him is all he yelled and ran and
the others got away in a big packard
too can you beat it

  the patrolman was obviously puzzled
he stood there looking down at the
twisted dead face and scratching his
head

  sorehead gang most likely he said
with a grunt of dismissal and just
another bum dropped dead nothing to
do about it

  wait a minute listen wyatt had
the queer stone in his hand and was
blurting out his story

  that thing the uniformed one
laughed scornfully hell man hes
been trying to get rid of that for hours

youre stuck is all it aint worth a
dime throw it away-anything

 but say-

  aw forget it scram the officer
turned his broad back

  a small crowd of night prowlers was
gathering and others of the police had
arrived some one produced a ragged
tarpaulin and drew it over the face
which stared ghastly there under the
street light the patrol van came clang-
ing and the crowd was warned back

  muttering disgustedly of the thick-
headedness of cops as a class and of
this one in particular wyatt drew aside
but he returned the tigers eye to his
pocket there was a mystery connected
with this stone and it might be theyd
listen to him at the station house hed
follow the van when they loaded the
body inside

  still it was hardly reasonable to think
the polished pebble had anything to do
with the case there was no case at
all when it came to that it was only
a matter of a pair of escaped thugs al-
ready forgotten by the minions of the
law and an outcast meeting a natural
death apoplexy they would write on
the police blotter and the poor old fel-
low would be buried in potters field

  with the ingrained caution that keeps
the native new yorker from mixing in
police matters if he can avoid it wyatt
decided to leave the scene and forget
his idea of visiting the station house
he made his belated way to the subway

  but jim wyatt was destined to spend
a restless night the tragedy preyed on
his mind and even in the snatches of
sleep that came to him it seemed that
the baleful eye of the polished mineral
was ever upon him

  daylight was a welcome relief and he
felt much better after his morning
shower and shave but the thing took
hold of him with renewed force when
cats eye



he left his bronx apartment and boarded
the subway for his place of business
lie was unable to read his newspaper
instead he stared vacantly at his fel-
low passengers and the tigers-eye was
an uncomfortable lump against his ribs
where it reposed in his vest pocket

  addison carr wyatts spirits rose
when he thought of the one friend to
whom he could go with the story carr
would know what to do in a case like
this he was interested in many things
besides his favorite hobby of scientific
research he dabbled in the mysterious
and occult had been through strange
adventures the very man to see

  wyatt left the subway at seventy-
second street this was one morning his
downtown garage business could go
hang

  in the spacious drawing room of
carrs apartments wyatt waited ner-
vously for his friend the place was
gloomy-the house was one of those old
brownstone fronts in the seventies-and
wyatt paced the floor then stopped sud-
denly and drew the strange cause of his
perturbation from his pocket placing it
gingerly on the mantel he breathed
easier then laughed aloud at his own
silly fears

  when carr greeted him he broke out
in a torrent of swift speech telling with
excitement the happenings of the night
before he drew his friend to the fire-
place and indicated the stone

  there it is he wound up now
tell me whats so all-fired important
about it and what im to do wyatt
was in a fernient

  carr picked up the stone and turned it
over between a thumb and forefinger
his gray eyes twinkling all steamed
up this morning arent you jim he
grinned the idea waking me up from
a sound sleep to listen to a yarn like
this itll spoil my breakfast

  sorry old man but the thing sort
of got on my nerves i had to see you
had to tell some one

m-m carr sobered running
long fingers through his tousled
mop of hair as wras his habit when
thinking deeply well seeing weve
started the day with such a bang lets
give a thought to this innocent looking
gem

  not worth anything is it

  not a great deal as ornamental stones
go its a crocidolite most people would
call the thing a south african cats-eye
a mineral silicate with silky fibers and
colored with iron oxide ordinarily found
in griqualand west when cut en cab-
ochon it shows this beautiful chatoyant
luster the line of light across the dome
which makes it look up at you like the
eye of a feline and gives it its name so
much for its background now for its
individual history thats what interests
us

  yes why the big to-do about the
thing wyatt scratched his chin and
gazed at the staring eye hypnotized
anew

  creepy thing at that mumbled carr
peering closely at the stone he fell si-
lent his brow wrinkled in thought
then ive heard of this stone lately

i think or one like it yes i know
there was an ad in yesterdays paper

  with characteristic abruptness he
dashed to the hall and was up the stairs
two at a bound in a moment he re-
turned with the crumpled sheets of a
newspaper in his arms

  here it is he exclaimed after a
quick search luther emory is adver-
tising for it offers a thousand dollars
reward and no questions asked an
odd thing that something back of
it

 a system of cutting a orecious or semi-precious stone
 with a smooth convex suriace without facets


amazing stories

  a thousand reward and lute emory
the owner ill say something is behind
it wyatt found it difficult to believe
what he saw there in black and white
but the description was exact this was
undoubtedly the stone the great explorer
had lost

  sa-ay drawled carr im going to
put this under the microscope emory
knows something and so do some other
people come on lets find out what it
is

  wyatt followed him into the labora-
tory and saw him insert the shiny pellet
into a receptacle that was part of a pon-
derous electrical mechanism dazzling
light bathed the stone at carrs touch of
a switch and his instrument purred
softly from some force from within

  microscope scoffed wyatt thats
no microscope

  carr laughed he was peering through
a double eye-piece making mysterious
adjustments as he replied not exactly
a microscope no its a device utilizing
radio waves which bore right into an
object we are able to see beneath the
surface with this and the magnification
can be made enormous    say

  whats wrong wyatt was startled
by the intensity of his friends exclama-
tion and the sudden rigidity of his
crouched body as those long fingers
tightened on the control knobs of the
instrument

  why-y- carr snapped his lean

form erect his face white gazed incred-
ulous

  and then it was as if a writhing liv-
ing substance flicked out of the recep-
tacle which held the cats-eye and
splashed against carrs temple clinging
there a moment like a dab of quivering
jelly and then vanished in a puff of light

  wyatt blinked as he would before a
photographers flash lamp he thought
at first that his eyes had deceived him

chapter ii
ayra

but carrs moan and his peculiar
actions were enough to show that
something very much out of the
ordinary had occurred the scientist
reeled jerkily toward his apparatus and
switched off the power with a hand that
moved stiffly as if unwilling to do his
bidding as the purr of the mechanism
died down he slumped into a chair and
sat swaying weakly his head raised
slowly agonizedly a purple splotch
was spreading from his temple to cover
his cheek

  wyatt recoiled from the face that
looked up at him lord man he
gasped what is it shall i get a
doctor

  carrs lips were drawn back from his
teeth with the intensity of his suffering
his eyes seemed suddenly to have sunk-
deep within their sockets he made a
desperate effort to speak but could not
slowly he shook his head in negation
pointing a rigid finger to the receptacle
in which lay the cats-eye

  understanding wyatt retrieved the
stone wishing fervently that he had
never seen the thing the very touch of
it gave him a chill

  still carr was unable to speak and
the purple blotch was growing larger
rapidly he fumbled for a pencil and
wrote painfully on the back of a note-
book that lay on the table

call emory was what he wrote

  rousing from the stupefaction which
had gripped him wyatt grabbed the

disappearances from civilization  his
constant bickerings with his con-
freres   

  the voice of the explorer came sharp-
ly over the wire

  seeing that carr was barely able to
hold himself erect in his chair wyatt
blurted out the story to emory in a
single muddled sentence a shout greet-
ed his words

  you have the stone then

  wyatt snapped yes but what about
carr the devilish thing has got him
in a bad way shall i take him to a
hospital 

  no no emorys voice was almost
panicky in the receiver keep your
shirt on young fellow hell be all right
just bundle him into a cab and bring him
up here

  although this was far from reassuring
to wyatt carr nodded when he asked
whether he was agreeable to the pro-
posal after that it was the work of
but a minute to get the afflicted scientist
into the street and ensconced in a taxi-
cab

  the ride up riverside drive and out
past the city limits was a nightmare
carr made ghastly inhuman noises in
his throat and his body was attacked
by a series of violent twitchings like
those of a man in an epileptic fit sev-
eral times wyatt was tempted to stop
the cab and call for an ambulance but
each time the scientist was able to make
his objection understood by unintelligible
croakings and agitated jerkings of his
head the hideous purple now covered
his entire face and the sunken eyes had
swollen completely shut he was in a
pitiable state and wyatt raged inwardly
as he saw the drivers grin reflected in
the rear-view mirror although it was
only natural that the fellow should think
carr was drunk

  eventually they reached the dilapi-

dated old mansion where emory made
his headquarters on the rare occasions
when he was in america an air of
decrepitude and decay hung about the
ancient frame structure its tumble-down
gables and crazily askew shutters pro-
claimed grossest neglect yet the ex-
plorer-scientist was reputed to be a
wealthy man

  by this time carr had lapsed into a
semi-conscious condition and wyatt had
considerable difficulty in getting him up
the rickety steps to the porch after dis-
charging the over-inquisitive taxi man
his temper was none too good as he
called out loudly for emory

  the explorer appeared at the door in
his shirt sleeves a stocky middle-aged
man with a fiery red beard that bristled
with intolerance and arrogance

  he said ha-stout fellow bring
him right in but wheres the stone

otone exploded wyatt you
 just forget that now and give me
a lift with carr so help me youll

pull him out of this or-

  emory made haste to lend a hand
and they brought carr through an an-
cient oak-paneled hall and into a lab-
oratory whose wealth and excellence of
equipment seemed utterly incongruous
here when they had the suffering sci-
entist stretched on a divan emory com-
pounded a potion from several colorless
liquids and poured it down his throat
carrs body relaxed immediately and he
fell into a natural sleep

  the explorers gaze measured wyatt
contemplatively ive seen you some-
where before this he inquired blandly

  yes oncc or twice union league

carrs direction how about my

  emory glowered hell sleep about

new but tell me about the stone
you have it

  that can wait until carr comes to
ha the explorers bushy red
brows drew together in anger then he
got control of himself theres a check
for a thousand in it he reminded
wyatt

  it can wait for a moment wyatt
thought emory would spring at his
throat and a feeling of exultation
surged up within him in the mood
which had come over him he would
have welcomed the encounter then he
saw the thick biceps relax under the
mans shirt

  very well said the explorer with
obviously feigned  indifference ill
leave you to watch over your friend
who by the way is a friend of mine
as well i have other things to do
he strode out of the rom without
so much as a backward glance

hen half an hour had passed
wyatt saw with relief carrs nor-
mal healthy color was returning the
swelling of his eyes had abated and his
breathing was easy and regular it was
evident that he would soon recover

  thinking the matter over more calmly
now wyatt regretted his antagonizing
of emory he would have preferred
talking with the man about the mys-
terious stone that was in his pocket and
about the queer missile which had
stricken carr without doubt there was
a connection between it and the cats-
eye there was some secret known to
emory and which carr had glimpsed
in the depths of the weird stone when
he had it in the radio microscope more
than one questionable happening had fol-
lowed that stone    the panhandlers
possession of it and his strange death
in the street    the two thugs who had
escaped the police   

  wyatt walked out into the hall fin-

gering the cats-eye in his pocket it
was icy-cold to his touch and he re-
linquished it with a new shiver of dis-
taste he could not have explained
why he had not flung the thing away
long before this suddenly finding the
air close and fetid inside he ambled out
upon the porch

  a soft voice hailed him from the
shrubbery

  he caught a glimpse of a small round
face with frightened eyes under a wind-
blown mass of golden hair then the
vision was obscured by the dense leaf-
age he plunged into the shrubbery on
the instant

  a girl whose like he had never seen
only in a garment of some shimmering
stuff that scarcely hid the outlines of
her superb figure she was like a wild
creature of an alien jungle obviously
of another race small in stature and
with skin like old ivory birdlike in her
poise she seemed about to run off
through the underbrush like a startled
fawn her eyes wide and clear were
of the deepest violet not blue violet
-and flecked with glints of gold wy-
atts heart skipped a beat

  please she said in agitated tones
please to make way with the stone
to the old man i give it that he might
dispose of it before the time is too late
now you have returned it here oh
i ask of you please to destroy it

  there was tragic earnestness in the
plea-nameless fear

  but why stammered wyatt how
did you know i had it

  i-i know there are others who

seek it and you must-

  she was interrupted by a call from
the house it was carr his voice
vibrant with suppressed excitement
the girl slipped off into the tangled
shrubbery and was gone

  for a moment wyatt stood speech-
less hardly believing he had seen and
cats eye



heard aright then awakening to real-
ity he answered his friends call com-
ing he sang out but in that instant
he decided to say nothing abotik the
girl at least for the time being

  carr was standing on the porch with
emory looking as if nothing had hap-
pened to him at all his lean cheeks
were flushed and he was fidgeting with
impatience

  make it snappy he urged and
give me the stone theres a big thing
here-in the laboratory

  wyatt saw the gloating in emorys
mien but handed over the cats-eye with-
out a word if carr said a thing was
all right it was all right besides he
was glad to be rid of the stone

  the two scientists dashed through the
hall and into the laboratory wyatt fol-
lowing at a more leisurely pace

what next ensued was utterly in-
comprehensible to the man who
knew all about automobiles and inter-
nal combustion engines but who had
never delved into the intricacies and
mysteries of physical science wyatt
was amazed at the enthusiasm of the
two scientists as they fingered the cats-
eye and discussed subjects that seemed
entirely foreign to the thing they were
examining

  they talked of the fourth and fifth
dimensions of the possibility of two
objects occupying the same space at the
same time due to difference in the con-
stitution of matter and the reversal of
direction of electronic revolutions of
the existence of a world within a world
and of planes of vibration they spoke
of unseen realms and the nearness of
creatures that existed but were not per-
ceived by the senses and then they
placed the cats-eye in a clamp that was
between two huge spheres of a compli-
cated electrical mechanism

  wyatt heard what they said dimly

but it made little impression on his
consciousness he was thinking of the
girl in the shrubbery and of her ob-
vious fear of her strange beauty

 carr seemed as excited as emory
he talked incessantly ignoring wyatt in
his intense interest in the answers given
to his questions by the explorer then
both scientists fell silent as the rising
whine of a generator somewhere in the
house resounded through the laboratory

  wyatt looked at the cats-eye where
it was held in the clamp it seemed to
him that the thing glimmered suddenly
with a new and unholy light that it
blinked knowingly and evilly as if set
in the head of a cunning and vicious
feline

  and then a small figure dashed into
the room and flung herself toward the
now humming mechanism it was the
golden-haired girl of the bushes

  emory shouted angrily ayra and
rushed in to intercept her

  her objective was not long in doubt
it was the glittering stone which had
seemed of such importance to so many
people she hurled her body between
the two spheres of the machine and
snatched at the cats-eye with trembling
fingers it was held fast by the clamp
and she tugged desperately to wrench
it free

 ayra emory shouted again and
this time his voice was a throaty bellow
he grasped the girls arm but she tore
it free of his grip

  carr stood watching as if stupefied

  then emory shook the girl violently
growling and cursing she resisted him
valiantly her eyes ablaze with fury the
explorer struck her resoundingly with
the flat of his hand

 that was too much for wyatt in
one stride he reached emory and
yanked him away whirled him around
the explorer was quick and was a

powerful man he drove a massive fist
into wyatts mid-section momentarily
winding him recovering wyatt drove
in a right that snapped the mans head
back and rocked him to his heels then
followed with a left that started from
the floor and caught the whiskered chin
at precisely the correct angle the ex-
plorer crashed in the midst of his ap-
paratus and lay still

  the girl avra had paid no atten-
tion but was still trying to work the
cats-eye free of its clamp she sagged
weakly as if about to collapse and wy-
att circled her with his arm to support
her

  carr was shouting an unintelligible
warning there came a sudden spiteful
whirr of the machine and a blinding
flash clinging fast to the girl wyatt
was buffeted by a force which permeated
every fibre of his being and racked him
with insupportable tortures there was
a warping of the very universe about
him a cataclysmic upheaval that flung
him into a fathomless abyss of blackness

  he knew no more

the other world

consciousness returned ab-
ruptly and painlessly wyatt
lay for a moment collecting his
senses overhead was a high dome the
room in which he found himself was
circular in shape windowless and with
walls of an unfamiliar bluish white
metal beneath his sprawled body the
floor was cold and hard but on his
breast reposed a soft burden it was
the girl ayra

  he moved her head to his knee as
he sat erect long lashes fluttered on
the ivory of her cheeks then they raised
and those gold-flecked violet eyes looked
up into his own terror came into them

on the instant and the girl leaped to her
feet

  her glance darted in all directions like
that of a trapped animal then she
breathed a sigh of relief

  for us it is most fortunate she said
none of them is here

  who asked wyatt staring stupidly
he saw then for the first time a pedestal
that rose from the floor at his side
rising he saw that it held at its tip a
replica of the cats-eye which had been
the cause of so much commotion dis-
gusted he growled another of the
blamed things so help me

  it is the same stone the girl averred
regarding it with new fear in her gaze
but this time she made no attempt to
remove it from its mounting

  a derisive comment was on the tip of
wyatts tongue the same stone she
had said but the words did not come 
he could not find it in him to ridicule
this girl who was so obviously in earnest
and so greatly agitated even now she
was tugging at his sleeve her parted lips
tremulous her gaze beseeching

  she whispered no time there is to
be lost if we are to preserve our lives
come ayra show the way

  nothing loth for the silence of the
place and the blinking of the cats-eye
gave him the creeps wyatt followed her
he was amazed to see a section of the
seemingly solid metal wall slide away at
a wave of ayras tiny hand disclosing
to view a long downward-sloping tunnel
which was lighted by a dim rosy glow
like the circular room this passage was
walled with smooth metal

  where in time are we  he asked the
girl as they entered the passage and the
door closed silently behind them

 in idilna - my home but please
to hurry the keepers of the stone
may return and find us ayra grasped
his hand and urged him onward as she
sped through the tunnel
cats eye



  but- wyatt started to object

  hush no sound must be made the
girl increased her speed

  there was nothing to do but follow
in silence it was utterly weird and im-
possible the thing which had happened-
that by some mechanical or electrical
means he and the girl had been trans-
ported to this strange place she had
named the place called it her home
where was it how had they arrived
who was ayra anyway and what had
the cats-eye-the two cats-eyes-to do
with all this wyatt could only wait
for the answers

  they left the main passage and en-
tered one which was unlighted here
the air was bad and the footing insecure
but ayra moved with the assurance born
of long familiarity with the way wyatt
clung to the soft warm hand within his
own stumbling along blindly it was
the first time he had ever depended so
entirely on a woman and what a wo-
man the fragrance of her hair was
in his nostrils   

  there were other dark passages-a
maze of them endless wandering it
seemed and then they halted at a blank
wall wyatt heard the click of a latch
and a door swung outward they were
in the open air on a ledge that projected
from the sheer wall of a cliff hundreds
of feet above the ground

an amazing scene was before them

	an arid and desolate valley with
rugged mountain peaks in the distance
with no sign of human habitation in
evidence the sky was leaden and a
huge blood-red sun hung motionless at
the horizon dust-clouds filled the air
a choking powdery dust that held the
odor of dissolution and decay as wyatt
stared a raucous shriek came out of the
skies and a great gaunt creature winged
its way from the cliff and swooped down
into the valley from wing tip to wing

tip it must have measured twenty feet
a pteranodon 

  wyatt turned inquiring eyes to the
girl

  it is idilna she explained simply
my home

  but where is it

  i know not ayra seemed lost in
thought for a moment but was quickly
herself again please to come at once
she begged from ayrad my father
you will learn more

  they moved along the ledge to a sec-
ond door which opened into the rock
beyond this there was an apartment
whose windows - narrow slits cut
through a three-foot wall of stone-
looked out over the barren valley ayra
called out in a strange tongue and with
a catch in her ordinarily mellow voice

  an undersized but stalwart old man
came in from an adjoining room his
face alight at seeing the girl but when
his eyes rested on wyatt he stiffened
and scowled darkly a blur of harsh
sibilants fell from his tongue and he
advanced threateningly

  ayra shook her golden head in nega-
tion silencing the old man with words
of his own speech which though im-
periously delivered held none of the
harshness that had marked his enuncia-
tion with not too good grace he moved
to her side and pressed his cheek to hers
in a barbaric sort of greeting

  my father smiled ayra in wyatts
direction that you were another stran-
ger like emory was his thought to
slay you was his wish but i have per-
suaded him otherwise

  perceiving that ayrads manner was
still sullen wyatt wras not so sure she
had been successful but he returned
with a nod the deep bow of the old man
and squatted before him on a mat pro-
vided by the girl these people had

 a genus of pterodactyls long extinct flying reptiles
its name indicates that it had no teeth


amazing stories

certainly quaint and primitive customs

  ayrad spoke then in english address-
ing his guest it is to me certain that
you come from the land of emree
what do you here in the company of
my daughter  his words were snapped
out jerkily and his mien was haughty

  the girl drew in her breath sharply
as she saw wyatt stiffen

  perhaps your daughter can answer
that better than i he said curtly

  ayra did answer in a rush of breath-
less english that was as much addressed
to wyatt as to her father of emorys
land is he assuredly but not of emorys
kind innocently he returned the stone
to emory after i had thought to lose it
but of emorys plans he knows nothing
at all besides this my father he came
here unknowingly and without willing
it an accident it was caused when he
tried to protect me from the wrath of
the fiery whiskered one please to know
oh ayrad that this man is good-and
kind-

  the old man raised a hand silencing
her his manner softened as he turned
toward wyatt i was mistaken in
you he apologized

  a thousand questions raced through
wyatts mind but he voiced none of
them ayra had dropped her head on
her last words and he was staring at its
tumbled crown of gold

  as if in answer to wyatts unspoken
thoughts ayrad commenced a long-
winded explanation which soon had his
guests attention the cats-eye on the
pedestal in that metal-walled circular
room was it seemed an object of wor-
ship to ay rads people it was sacred
as were its keepers of which ayrad had
been one until recently sacred indeed
for did it not mirror another world
where godlike beings dwelt beings who
resided in comfort and luxury who rode
the heavens in great winged machines of
their own contriving who had command

of forces long lost to the knowledge of
idilnians

  then emree had come to them from
this other world and they had at first
looked upon him as a god he had re-
mained with them for a year in ay-
rads household that was how father
and daughter had learned the language
but emree had betrayed them and
brought about their present exile there
were two races in idilna warring races
and this emree whom they load thought
a god had aligned himself with the en-
emies of ayrads people and planned the
theft of a huge treasure from the tem-
ple of the stone the plot discovered
ayrad and ayra were in disrepute their
lives forfeit and so they had hidden
themselves in this place emree escap-
ing to his own world had been followed
by two of the emperors guards who
sought his life as well as the stone that
was in his possession ayra followed in
an attempt to destroy emrees stone and
by sacrificing herself clearing her father
of the suspicion which had come upon
him incidentally by making away with
emrees stone would she not prevent the
return of the red-whiskered one who
might be planning to come with rein-
forcements 

wyatt listened in amazement to
the old mans dissertation some
of his own questions had been answered
but not all there was yet much about
this business which was incomprehen-
sible to him

  it is the gateway between the two
worlds the cats-eye ayrad went on
through it this emree pass from one
to other using the force we keepers
knew nothing of in both worlds exist
the stone and in either the force is ef-
fective

  all very confusing to an automobile
dealer wyatt lighted a cigarette and
flipped the match through one of the
cars eye



window slits with an unerring aim that
brought a gasp of admiration from ayra

  but where is idilna he demanded

  ayrad knows not the old man
shrugged helplessly but one thing we
know-it is not like your world it is
dead world our sun stand still in sky
our heat gradually leave us vegetation
die and beasts dying also-mankind die
finally

  emory promised lukha-our enemies
-he will take them to his own world
ayra put in this to bribe them but
he lie i know

  recalling certain unsavory rumors con-
cerning emory wyatt was not so sure
that he had lied and this opened up new
possibilities he scratched his chin un-
certainly thinking of some of the ex-
plorers talk with carr back there in the
laboratory of their enthusiasm over
the fourth and fifth dimensions and or-
bital revolutions of electrons whatever
these might portend of one realm ex-
isting at the same time and in the same
space as another it was all too fantastic
and unreal yet here he sat   

  there came an insistent banging at
the outer door ayra paled and her
father rose to his feet drawing a curi-
ous pistol-like weapon from the folds of
his tunic

almost immediately the door
crashed in and four husky guards
were in the room ayrads weapon
twanged and a writhing shaft of milky
substance darted to the breast of one of
the intruders memory came to wyatt
of the thing which had stricken carr
down but here the effect was different
the milky- substance congealed instantly
covering its victim with a quivering mass
of jelly that brought him to the floor
in a squirming helpless mound it was
horrible that jelly living protoplasm
which absorbed swiftly the human food
that was within its folds

  another of the weird weapons twanged
and ayrad was down ayra screamed
and rushed upon the guard who had
fired beating at his face with ineffectual
little fists wyatt who had been stunned
by the suddenness and deadliness of the
thing went into action his long arms
flailing

  these men were of similar mold to
ayrad-short stocky fellows with bulg-
ing muscles and massive shoulders but
they knew nothing of the art of boxing
and were completely taken by surprise
when wyatt rushed them the first went
off his feet and crashed in a corner un-
der the impetus of a hard-driven fist
which made a sound like a breaking
board when it struck his jaw the sec-
ond fired his pistol but wyatt had his
wrist in a grip that spoiled his aim
milky protoplasm splashed the ceiling
and dripped stickily nastily having no
organic substance on which to feed it
became inert

  but wyatt had his hands full with this
one ayras cries were in his ears driv-
ing him frantic distracting him and
the guard had wround legs and arms
around him in such a manner that he
could neither use his fists nor wrench
himself free he resorted to an old
trick relaxing suddenly and slumping in
the fellows arms as if yielding in
that moment his antagonist was off guard
and off balance releasing his crushing
grip for just the moment wyatt needed
the pistol changed hands swiftly and
came down with a crunch on the guards
skull

  the one who struggled with ayra
yelled when he saw his only remaining
ally fall released her and turned to flee
wyatt shot him down without compunc-
tion albeit he shuddered at the avidity
of the ghastly living shroud that envel-
oped him so speedily

  ayra bruised and sobbing was glad
for wyatts supporting arm gently he

drew her from the room of sudden and

emorys return

in an adjoining chamber wyatt wait-
ed until the girl had regained a
measure of composure finally her
sobbing ceased and she looked up at him
expectantly not once had she spoken
of her fathers passing but those violet
eyes were eloquent of grief

  how do we get out of here wyatt
asked her

  no way there is but through the
temple of the stone the girls tone
was dubious

  a sudden thought came to wyatt
how did you get to my world in the
first place he inquired if return were
now possible it would be the easiest solu-
tion of her difficulties

  ayra brightened unknown to the
keepers this emory had put a machine
in the pedestal of the stone when ac-
cused by the emperor ayra revealed this
to him and thus it was his guards did
follow the red-whiskered one ayra es-
caped after that and she too followed
in such manner if but the machine
remains-

  ill gamble it does lets go

  ayras gaze dropped to her garment
and hot color flooded her cheeks it
was torn almost to shreds from her
struggle with the guard revealing start-
ling the ivory creaminess of her skin

  i-i must change my robe she fal-
tered

  wyatt chuckled make it snappy
then he urged

  after she had gone from the room
he strolled into the chamber of death
they had left only two bodies were
there those of the guards he had fought
with his hands both had died instantly

of the others or of the jelly which had
overcome them there was no sign
whether the devilish stuff had crawled
away after feeding or whether it had
itself been consumed in the consuming
of its victims he could only conjecture

  a sound rang through the apartment
the crash of an overturned object in
some distant room genuinely alarmed
wyatt barged through the place calling
for ayra as he ran there was no reply

  he had thought that the door through
which they had entered was the sole en-
trance to the hideaway but certainly the
girl had not gone out that way else he
should have seen her as certainly she
was not in any of the rooms

  cursing himself for a fool wyatt
came to the grudging conclusion that
ayra had deceived him that she had de-
liberately left him to his own devices
in a place that would soon be swarming
with foes but a more careful search
of the place unearthed evidence to the
contrary in a dark corner he found
a shred of clothing amidst the fragments
of what had been a large urn there
had been a struggle then another shred
of filmy material apparently embedded in
the wall at a point waist-high from the
floor indicated the existence of a secret
panel there was another exit

  wyatt felt carefully along the wall un-
til his fingers encountered a spring the
panel slid back noiselessly and he was in
a passage like those through which the
girl had brought him here clutching
the dead guards pistol he felt his way
cautiously through the blackness

 his mind no longer seethed with
doubts and questionings it did not mat-
ter now where idilna was located what
sort of a world he was in nor how he
had arrived all that mattered was
ayra finding her and getting her out
of this mess became his sole concern

  once he thought he heard voices ahead
and he increased his pace only to come
cats eye



up against the dead end of a passage
he retraced his steps and went into a
branch passage where the going was
easier this sloped upward and soon he
saw a dim light ahead and then he
was in a lighted tunnel one that he rec-
ognized it was not far to the circular
room of the cats-eye

  reaching the door at the end of the
passage he pressed his ear to the smooth
metal the rumble of an angry voice
came from beyond-the voice of lute
emory

a swift search of the moulding dis-
closed the spring which released the
door it slid back revealing a strange
tableau in the circular room emory
and carr stood by the pedestal which
held the stone and facing them was a
much disheveled ayra who was between
two most hideous man-creatures emory
was berating the girl in no uncertain
terms

  these beings who guarded ayra were
in nowise similar to her father or to
the guards wyatt had seen before they
were tall and gaunt red skinned and
naked save for loin cloths of some glit-
tering woven stuff their heads were
enormous totally bald and globular in
shape they had no ears but instead
great round diaphragms set flush with
their skulls and stretched tight like drum-
heads almost transparent these dia-
phragms fluttered under the impact of
emorys voice waves

  carr was watching in a dreamy sort
of way apparently unmoved

  whats the big idea wyatt de-
manded wrath fully edging in between
ayra and the explorer

  emorys face purpled he seemed on
the verge of apoplexy but carr nudged
him and the explosion that had been im-
minent expended itself in a mere
splutter ha he growled hardly
expected to see you yet wyatt hm

but you keep your shirt on young fel-
low and dont butt in on this until you
know what its all about carr here has
thrown in with me and ill have an offer
for you presently in the meanwhile ill
deal with this hell-cat ayra as i see
fit

  wyatt restrained himself at what he
thought was a warning signal from
carrs gray eyes youll not harm her
he offered nevertheless he was puzzled
by the entire proceeding surprised that
carr had cast his lot with emory in a
deal so obviously shady or had he

  no shell not be harmed the ex-
plorer rumbled only kept under re-
straint during the revolution

  revolution wyatt realized then that
these gibbous-headed monsters with ay-
ra were of the lukha enemies of her
people and the allies of emory in his
plottings sounds of strife came faintly
through the metal walls and he knew
now why he had seen none of the keep-
ers of the stone	

  he lie the girl averred stoutly
well he knows the lukha will slay
ayra so soon as he departs with what
he came for

  youll release her emory said wy-
att grimly ill look out for her not
these skinny apes so help me

  the explorer laughed raucously so
you fell for the little trollop he sneered

  wyatt saw red and his long arm shot
out like- a flash but this time emory
beat a swift retreat dodging behind the
pedestal in a fury he bellowed ive
had enough of your interference take
him away lukha-take the girl too
ayra cried out in fear or in pain he
could not tell which but it was enough
to goad wyatt into a wild lunge over the
pedestal carrs attempt to restrain him
went unnoticed but vicious triumph
was in emorys leer and wyatt never
reached him for he was halted midway
in his rush by a pair of wiry arms which


amazing stories

encircled him and pinned his own arras
to his sides

  he was in the grip of one of the
lukha and it was impossible to squirm
out of that steel-muscled embrace oth-
ers of the red men came from nowhere
seeming to spring up from the very floor
and he was carried kicking and strug-
gling vainly and ignominiously carried
one moment and dragged the next un-
til the circular room was left behind
the sound of emorys laughter died out
in the distance

  eventually bruised and sore he was
dumped into a narrow ccll and the door
clanged shut behind him

ouefully wyatt surveyed his
surroundings the air was stag-
nant in this place and the floor was
ankle deep with indescribable filth its
sole article of furniture was a long metal
bench which must serve as seat or couch
the grilled door was securely locked and
the only light came through a four-inch
slit in the metal wall a slit that rose
from the level of his shoulders to the
ceiling some three feet above through
this opening filtered the din of combat

  wyatt moved to the opening and
sniffed the outside air finding it but little
better than that in his prison but from
this place he had a restricted view of
what was evidently a public square a
broad plaza with a tall monument in its
center and flanked by conical buildings
whose lustrous metallic walls reflected
the dull red of the motionless sun in
sombre and eery shades patches of
light at the tips of the cones made of
them huge poniards whose points had
drawn human blood

  and human blood was being spilled in
the square below hundreds of lukha
swarmed over the area and they were
battling the shorter and stockier idil-
nians with wicked curved blades which
rose and fell with deadly accuracy the

defenders outnumbered many times
fought valiantly and occasionally vic-
toriously but quarters were too close
and their own forces too disorganized
for effective use of their protoplasm pis-
tols there could be but one outcome

  fuming helplessly wyatt left the ap-
erture and hunched his aching body on
the bench one thing was sure-carr
was not in this thing with emory not
as an ally he had come to this night-
marish place with the explorer under
that pretext but actually because he was
the kind who would never desert a friend
who was in difficulties wyatt knew
carr of old even now that fertile brain
of his had probably concocted some
scheme to get them out of this but
the getting out was likely to be a slow
and dangerous process for carrs scien-
tific bent was sure to keep him on the
scene as long as new discoveries were
to be made

  piecing together the bits of informa-
tion given him by ayra and her father
wyatt could only conclude that emory
had carefully organized this raid of the
lukha and timed his return to coincide
with it that was why he had been so
anxious to get his hands on the cats-eye
though it was still not at all clear to
wyatt how the weird stone fitted into
the picture if there was a treasure
emory expected to get for himself he
would make sure that no one else
shared it his promises to the lukha
would mean nothing he would find some
way of double-crossing them quite
likely he planned to double-cross carr
as well

 as for ayra-wyatts throat con-
stricted when he thought of her he
had not the least idea what they had
done or would do with her and certainly
there was no help for her to be obtained
from emory

  wyatts hand encountered a hard ob-
ject in his pocket it was the pistol he
cats eye



had taken from the guard luckily the
lukha had not frisked him he exam-
ined it curiously and found it to be a
simple enough arm operating by com-
pressed air and containing eight gray-
ish-white pellets in its magazine these
were the missiles which released the
deadly protoplasm he replaced the
weapon in his pocket gingerly it might
be that it would come in handy later

  a sudden increase in the din outside
cut short his reflections and brought him
again to the narrow window the fight-
ing out there had ended and in the
corpse-strewn plaza not one of the
white-skinned men of idilna remained on
his feet only the hideous big-heads
were left and these formed a howling
milling triumphant mob in their midst
was emory grinning evilly and shouting
approbation carr was not with him
wyatts stomach went suddenly hollow
and he returned to his bench

 fsst the sound was barely au-
dible but was repeated more loudly
this time psst

  wyatt raised his head and looked di-
rectly into the smiling gray eyes of
addison carr who stood on the other
side of the grilled door a key rattled
in the lock

  dog-gone exulted wyatt i knew
youd be here

  hanged if i thought i would i had
to do for the fellow with the keys and
he was a tough customer carr had
the door open now and wyatt saw
that he was bleeding freely from half a
dozen gashes about the head and arms

  emorys completely nuts he grunted
then

 and then some i saw him in the
square

  carr glanced at the narrow window
an odd thing that he drawled he
doesnt realize what he has let loose

but while he is celebrating well have
a chance to do something

  meaning what

  why thousands of these killers will
be streaming through into new york

its our job to prevent it if-

  a confused murmur was heard in the
corridor and immediately it was filled
with men the white-skinned folk of
idilna a number of them halted at the
open door of the cell wyatt drew the
pistol from his pocket

 hold on now whispered carr
lets see if we can arbitrate

  he faced the idilnians with hands ex-
tended to indicate peaceful intentions
wyatt not without reluctance followed
him into the corridor the two were
surrounded at once and hustled along
by the press of gibbering undersized
creatures

chapter v

keepers of the stone

they passed many barred cells in
the corridor and wyatt tried to
peer into each one hoping to see
ayra efforts to communicate with the
idilnians were of no avail as there
seemed to be none among them who un-
derstood his words he saw carr ahead
waving his arms doing his best to con-
vey some understanding to one who
seemed to be leader but there was no
indication that he was succeeding

  it was impossible to know whether
those about them were friendly or inim-
ical as they presented countenances that
were devoid of expression they ap-
peared to be unarmed and wore scarlet
robes that hung to the floor

  finally in mounting impatience wy-
att grasped one of those nearest to him
and brought him to a stop by one of
the cell doors he pointed through the
grill and repeated ayra-where is
she


amazing stories

   the idilnians eyes lighted with com-
prehension then became crafty he
jerked himself free of wyatts grip and
fell back in the procession to jabber ex-
citedly with a comrade wyatt gave it
up after that

   presently they emerged in the circular
room of the cats-eye where possibly
fifty of the red-robed idilnians were as-
sembled at the side of the pedestal
stood one who was taller and of even
more dignified bearing than the others
wyatt and carr were led before him

  you be friends of emree he in-
toned without expression

   carr replied feelingly not friends
no only countrymen

  then you help defeat emree and
lukha it was not a request but a
command and uttered in tones that
brooked no argument

  after what he had seen wyatt wras
more than willing he saw carr nod
agreement but could not resist demand-
ing wheres ayra

  the spokesman of the robed idilnians
frowned of more importance this
he droned tonelessly

  he raised his hand and an awed si-
lence fell on the assemblage the hid-
den lights dimmed and the idilnians fell
to their knees in a circle which en-
closed the pedestal their eyes raised to
the great dome overhead wyatt look-
ing furtively at the cats-eye saw that
it was aglow with a fitful and eerie radi-
ance

  this was a ceremony these were the
keepers of the stone

  the silence lasted several minutes
then was broken by a low chant that
came from the throats of the kneeling
ones seeing that the eyes of the wor-
shippers were not closed but wide and
staring wyatt craned his neck to peer
into the depths of the dome above them
immediately he was lost in wonder

  pictured there on the inner surface

of the dome projected from the flick-
ering cats-eye as if from the lens of a
motion picture machine was a swiftly
changing panorama the tall buildings
of lower and midtown manhattan passed
in review the ships of the harbor and
river a great dirigible soaring high over
the palisades closer views of the
streets dizzyingly swaying men and
women walking surface cars trucks and
taxicabs in the usual rush of mid-day
traffic

  the chanting of the keepers rose to a
high pitch of enthusiasm then broke off
on a note of expectancy as the normal
illumination of the chamber was re-
stored

  you have seen said the one by
the pedestal to us are these gods
these like you and like emree but
emree we learn to be evil spirit al-
ready have he cause lukha to slay more
than half of those our people already
have he steal treasure from temple be-
neath he shall die and you his coun-
trymen shall assist

  switching to his own tongue the
chief keeper addressed his cohorts
sharply they dispersed immediately
going out through numerous doors which
opened in the metal wall when the cir-
cular room was empty save for the two
new yorkers and the chief keeper the
doors closed

 very soon now the keeper in-
toned very soon come emree and his
murderers to take riches of temple to
your world but we prevent he know
powers of stone we not know but
keepers know other powers

  a pencil shaft of orange radiance
stabbed down from the dome and im-
pinged on the cats eye making of it sud-
denly a thing of dancing flame pulsing
rhythmically it filled the air of the room
with a vibration which caused the skin
to creep and hair to rise on end

  wyatt could see from carrs expres-
cats eye



sion that he too was puzzled by the
phenomenon and more than a little
disturbed

one of the metal panels slid back and
emory burst into the room shout-
ing a score of the lukha followed him
and each of the monsters bore on his
shoulders a bulky sack the chief
keeper stood regarding them with im-
passive mien arms folded across his
breast

  seeing wyatt and carr emory went
beserk with rage ha he bellowed
a fine sneaking pair you are and
now i have you where i want you

  a heavy automatic appeared in his
hand a weapon strangely out of place
in these surroundings but none the less
deadly its muzzle raised slowly and a
grin of anticipation spread over the red-
whiskered face above it but before he
could press the trigger living fire spouted
from ttie cats eye bathing him from
head to foot in a ghastly flickering il-
lumination the pistol clattered to the
floor and emory shrieked with pain

  but he seemed to be unsinged as the
flame receded only gripped by a strange
paralysis that contorted his features and
cramped his limbs into grotesquely
twisted members some weird energy
from out the cats eye   

  emory slumped to the floor and lay
there writhing kill them he babbled
kill the keeper kill all three i
say

  but flame spouted anew from the tip
of the pedestal and the lukha were
stricken down a had been their leader
the bags they carried fell from helpless
fingers

  the chief keeper yelled exultantly
and the room swarmed with his co-
horts who streamed in from their hid-
ing places they gathered the sacks into
a heap at the base of the pedestal
wyatt gasped as one burst open re-

leasing a glittering trickle of precious
stones

  two of the robed idilnians dragged
emory to his feet and brought him be-
fore the chief keeper the flame of the
cats-eye had died down to a mere
smoulder and he seemed to be recover-
ing from his incapacitation he snarled
defiance

 unmoved the chief keeper said
now emree you see other powers of
the stone you see treasure of temple
forever lost to you or your kind then
you die

 once more the flame struck down
from the pedestals tip this time with
a furious roaring and a white heat the
pile of bulging sacks melted away under
its fury leaving only a blackened area
on the metal floor emory cursed and
raved like a madman he was hurled
back among the jabbering partially par-
alyzed lukha by the two keepers who
held him

  and you said the chief keeper
turning to carr and wyatt you die
with emree

  wyatt fingered the protoplasm pistol
in his pocket undecidedly

  hold on now carr said placating-
ly we are no enemies weve done
nothing-

 enough you came here with em-
ree with him you die

 palming the heavy pistol wyatt
struck out at the keeper had the blow
reached him he would have been felled
like an ox but it did not reach him
for a blinding light leaped up from the
cats eye and flung wyatt back among
the fallen lukha excruciating agonies
ran through his veins as if his blood had
turned to molten metal a red film blotted
out his vision his muscles refused to
do his bidding

  eimly he heard carrs shout of anger
and the ensumg scuffle a confused


amazing stories

babble of sound followed and the red
film cleared away he saw that fresh
numbers of the lukha were crowding
into the room that a furious fight was
raging the red-robed ones fought with
short swords they had drawn from under
their draperies the lukha with the
wicked curved knives he had seen them
use in the square the chief keeper
stood calmly by the pedestal of the cats-
eye watching for a chance to release its
energies against the enemies of his peo-
ple but his followers were so inextri-
cably mixed in with the attackers that it
was impossible for the time to dis-
tinguish friend from foe

finding his strength returning
wyatt drew himself up on one elbow
then to his knees carr was beside him
groaning but gamely fighting the par-
alyzing energy which had him in its grip
emory crawling near them hissed the
pedestal fellows if they get me try
and start the generator in its base you

get back sorry-

  a dying keeper staggered against him
and the two went down in a heap wyatt
remembered what ayra had said about
that generator and he struggled to his
feet pulling carr with him he still had
the pistol gubbing it he struck down
a keeper who swung at them with his
sword then steel bit into his shoulder
from another quarter and he was forced
to release his hold of carr and fight for
his life	

  pandemonium reigned in the circular
chamber the fighters surged this way
and that and wyatt found himself bat-
tling lukha and keepers alike then
he saw before him a robed one whose
face seemed familiar it was the one he
had halted by the cell and spoken to of
ayra the girl was with him whether
with friendly or malicious intent the
keeper had sought her out and brought
her to this place of death

  wyatt went cold with horror get
her out of here he yelped

 no the girl begged please
 to let ayra stay she help

  before wyatt could prevent it she
had wriggled her small body through
the bloody press and miraculously
reached the pedestal where she faced the
chief keeper wyatt battered in a bul-
bous head which came up before him
under a blade that never completed its
arc and fought his way to her side

  she was arguing in her own tongue
with the chief keeper but his compressed
lips and unyielding countenance showed
that he had no thought of giving in to
whatever it was she was requesting

  at that moment a group of lukha
rushed the pedestal and the chief keep-
er was swiftly victim to the vicious
thrust of a curved blade which passed
entirely through his body wyatt brained
his assailant with the butt of his pis-
tol drawing ayra into the protection of
his left arm as he swung at the others
with his right the robed one who had
brought her leaped into the fray with
sweeping short sword decapitating two
of the lukha before he was slain wy-
att snatched up a dripping curved blade
from the floor and wielded it to good
effect

  it was a nightmare this struggle in
the room of the stone the shaft of
orange light still struck down from the
dome and the cats-eye bathed in its
luminescence wras a living gloating thing
watching the carnage seeming to wait
for an opportunity of sits own

  carr had managed to reach the ped-
estal and was working swiftly through
a door which he found in its base
thrusting the girl behind him wyatt
kept his blade whistling in a sweeping
arc which held back the nearest of their
attackers he saw emory rise up howl-
ing and bowl over keepers like nine-
cats eye



pins he too was making for the ped-
estal and the lukha were defending
him

  a sharp cry from ayra warned wyatt
of danger behind and he wheeled in time
to catch on his own blade a descending
short sword meant for carr he im-
paled the keeper who wielded it

  and then a humming commenced with-
in the pedestal rising higher in pitch un-
til it grew to a shriek the hubbub of
fighting was lulled as the orange light-
shaft from above flashed out with a
thunderous roar mighty energies had
been in conflict forces beyond human
comprehension and the one in the ped-
estal had triumphed

  lukha and keepers hitherto engaged
in mortal combat ceased their efforts
to stare open-mouthed toward the ped-
estal the cats-eye blinked wisely in
the midst of a growing blue radiance
which seemed to be a tangible substance
a prickly sensation crept up wyatts
arm as the light bathed his flesh and he
recoiled from it instinctively

  carr rose up and grabbed him stay
here he said inside the sphere of
its influence

  wyatt ducked into the swelling blue
light-bubble with ayra and was imme-
diately shot through and through with
vibratory energies that were more ex-
hilarating than otherwise there was a
sharp tang of ozone in the air he
breathed the radiance was all around
him

  recovering from their astonishment
keepers and lukha made a concerted
rush for the pedestal immediately the
fighting was resumed

  hold it carr shouted emory the
lever just beneath the tip move it
forward

  wyatt saw carr fumbling with the
lever saw the battling idilnians surging
nearer saw emory a blood-smeared
demon swinging a lukha knife with

deadly rhythm indiscriminately now
he fought lukha and keeper then a
blinding light shut out the view

  again there was the wrenching of the
very universe about wyatt a tremendous
thump as of the blasting asunder of the
cosmos the rush through infinite
space in utter blackness the physical tor-
ture came next

  but through it all there was the com-
forting knowledge of ayras warm body
pressed close to his own

chapter vi

nemesis

this time he did not lose con-
sciousness but reeling drunkenly
came suddenly to the realization
that he was in emorys laboratory so
tightly was he holding ayra that she
whimpered softly in the semi-coma
into which she had fallen he moved
her to one of emorys deep armchairs
and disposed her comfortably there

  carr was hanging on to one of the
supports of emorys apparatus looking
dazedly at the cat-eye where it re-
posed in the clamp between the two huge
spheres seeming to be identical with
the one they had left behind in idilna
the uncanny thing blinked eerily

  say carr croaked do you see
what i do

  wyatt growled yes and pounced
on the stone the ill-omened thing would
bring no further destruction hed tear
it from the clamp and smash it bury
it-anything to get it out of the way

  hold on now drawled carr
theres emory back there he may fight
through poor devil he didnt know
thats right wyatt let his fingers
fall from the clamp and stepped back
from between the spheres

  then he saw the two who were watch-
ing them squat wide fellows in the


amazing stories

garb of civilization they were undoubt-
edly idilnians-the two guards sent by
the emperor the thugs who had fol-
lowed the old panhandler in emorys
car after ayra had given him the cats-
eye each of them held a protoplasm
pistol

  stand back one of them com-
manded

  wyatts hand moved toward his pocket
but dropped abruptly as one of those
wicked looking pistols came up sharply

   no resistance snapped the idilnian
else you die it is but to obey the
emperors word we are here

  for a long space no one moved or
spoke the silence was fraught with un-
uterable menace wyatt fidgetted shift-
ing his weight from one foot to the
other and then he was aware of a
sound like the purring of a feline a
sound that rose and fell but always
seemed to emanate from the winking
cats-eye

  confound the thing he muttered
its got me dotty

  darting a sidewise glance in carrs
direction he saw that he too was star-
ing at the yellow stone as if hypnotized
and his long fingers running nervously
through his rumpled and blood-matted
hair

  ayra sighed and rose weakly from her
chair

  one of the idilnians barked sit
down

   without protest she subsided

  still nothing happened then wyatt
scratched his chin looking over at ayra
who had slumped into the chair and sat
stoically waiting her eyes were wide
but unafraid violet eyes flecked with
gold more loudly still came the purring
sound from the vicinity of the cats-
eye wyatt lighted a cigaret and flipped
his match into the fireplace the muzzle
of a protoplasm pistol swung toward him

at the movement still nothing hap-
pened

  then the floor heaved to some un-
named and unnameable force from the
cats-eye came a hissing sound and with
it a blue-lit vaporous emanation that
formed into a perfect sphere which
rested on the base of the mechanism of
the two spheres came a tremendous
jarring of the place and the blue light
vanished

otaggering toward them was em-
 ory blinded hacked almost to rib-
bons but alive ha he gloated i
licked em

  the idilnians pistols twanged simul-
taneously and two milky blobs of proto-
plasm splashed on the explorers bare
chest cursing and shrieking horribly
he tore at the jelly-like stuff with his
hands but was borne quickly to the
floor his cries smothered the emper-
ors guards had not waited in vain

  sick with horror wyatt averted his
gaze from the writhing mound of white
the two idilnians were backing toward
the apparatus of the two spheres their
pistols covering their retreat

  divining their purpose carr yelled
dont touch the controls its sure
death with the machine in idilna run-
ning at the same time

  the word of the emperor must be
obeyed answered one grimly

   still threatening with their pistols both
moved in between the spheres flanking
the clamp which held the cats-eye the
light in the uncanny stone seemed to
flicker with renewed vigor as they did
so in its stare was ghoulish anticipa-
tion

  one of them reached for the starting
switch and there came the whine of the
hidden generator dazzling flame bathed
them for an instant and was snuffed out
with a blast of heat so intense as to
drive the watchers to the far side of
cats eye





the room molten metal dripped from
the spheres and these sagged down into
shapeless lumps where the two guards
had stood was nothing but a smouldering
mass a second flash from the appara-
tus itself was accompanied by a cloud
of black smoke and the odor of burning
insulator filled the room the whine of
the generator ceased abruptly

  the cats-eye had been consumed in
the white heat of the released energy
or at least was fused into the melted ma-
terial

  and that carr said regretfully is
that

 looking once more at the rapidly
shrinking mass of protoplasm on the
floor carr took the pistol from his
pocket and tossed it into the pool of
molten metal where the spheres had
been with satisfaction he saw it sink
into the mass and disappear

  ayra was sobbing softly

  ill gamble thats the end of idilna
wyatt whispered to carr and she
knows it poor kid

  the scientist nodded solemnly then
his gray eyes twinkled its the end
of your thousand bucks too he
grinned

an hour later having cleansed and
bandaged their wounds the two
men sat in carrs living room ayra
exhausted from her experiences was
curled up on the divan asleep

  wish we could have stayed longer
at that said carr his gaze far away
his fingers drumming the arm of his
chair

 wyatt said feelingly you would
youll be walking around with a magni-
fying glass and a notebook when you get
o the pearly gates but im all-fired
thankful we came out of it with a whole
skin and that the cats-eye is out of
existence

  i wonder if it is

  mean to say it survived that heat up
at emorys place

  carr answered thoughtfully no i
dont it has ceased to exist in our
plane thats certain but in other planes
-i dont know

  whats all this about planes and di-
mensions mind telling me some more
about it wyatt was risking exposure
to one of those long scientific disserta-
tions of the scientists

  youve seen the theory that our
universe is five-dimensional of course
well the fourth dimension is what we
call space-time the fifth is yet unex-
plored but emory called it and im
inclined to agree with his definition the
ratio of oscillation intervals there may
be many planes in this fifth dimension
each with a different rate of electronic
motion and constituted of matter built up
in an entirely different manner from
that which we are familiar idilna might
well be on one of these planes separated
from us only by its differing automatic
makeup the co-ordinates of space-time

time now-

  carr paused and reached for his slide-
rule

  oh ill believe you wyatt put in
hastily ill believe that idilna is any-
where you say or that atoms can turn
inside out but i want to know where
the cats-eye came in and what you saw
in your radio-microscope and what hap-
pened between the time ayra and i went
through and the time you and emory
arrived

  carr sighed and replaced the slide-
rule wyatt knew he itched to get into
a maze of involved mathematics

  i saw idilna in the stone if you
want to know he said and evidently
the etheric vibrations of the microscope
beam were of such nature as to permit
a partial connection between the two
planes i saw the keepers of the stone
and they saw me one of them fired a


amazing stories

protoplasm pistol and its charge came
through incompletely materialized in our
plane because the getaway was not wide
open thats why the stuff acted as it
did instead of killing me outright be-
cause of similiar experiences previously
emory knew how to cure me

  he came across the stone originally
in some ruins he unearthed in cam-
bodia and discovered its reflections of
idilna by accident later he developed
an apparatus which altered the vibra-
tion characteristics of space around the
stone and permitted him to pass between
the planes emory told me these things
after you and the girl had gone through
and naturally i agreed to follow with
him the rest you know as much as i
do

  you believe the stone here was the
same one we saw in idilna wyatt
asked existing in both places at the
same time

  and probably in the same relative
position in space if emorys theory is
correct

xt that about the tricks the head
  vv keeper played with it

  those unfortunately ill never be
able to explain carrs face was rue-
ful as he said this and another thing
puzzles me

  whats that

have you looked at your watch
wyatt consulted his timepiece seeing
that it lacked ten minutes of noon
weve been away more than twenty-
four hours he exclaimed

  not so you could notice it said
carr we were in idilna less than
thirty minutes of our time

  wyatt started so what he de-
manded

the

  it means that the time co-ordinate of
existence in idilna is far different from
ours time there passes much more
rapidly idilna is on a planet which is
of incalculable age it has ceased rotating
on its axis as is evidenced by the fixed
position of its sun in the sky it may-
be it is our own planet-millions of
years hence

  rats wyatt guffawed noisily

   but the scientist was serious its pos-
sible at that he insisted

  a new thought struck wyatt and
he glanced anxiously at ayra

  it was carrs turn to laugh you
neednt worry he grinned shell not
become an old woman in a few weeks
passing through to our plane has altered
her make-up to suit her to the new en-
vironment otherwise she could not
have come through

  wyatt did not reply he was mar-
veling anew at the fresh beauty of the
sleeping girl

  wonder how shell take to our way
of living carr said softly

   ill do everything possible to make it
pleasant for her so help me saying
this wyatt did not observe the twinkle
that came into his friends eyes nor the
look of something like envy which re-
placed it so quickly

   ayra stirred in her sleep flinging out
her arms in a beseeching gesture
jeem she called plaintively

  wyatt had told her to call him jim
he was at her side in a single bound
in another moment those violet eyes
were looking up at him from under dewy
lashes

  neither ayra nor wyatt took notice
of the fact that carr crept silently to-
ward his laboratory slide-rule in hand

roger carries on

for gray roger had not per-
ished in the floods of nevian
energy which had destroyed his
planetoid while those terrific
streamers of force emanating
from the crimson obscurity surround-
ing the  amphibians space-ship were
driving into his defensive screens roger
sat impassive and immobile at his desk
his hard gray eyes moved methodically
over his instruments and recorders and
after a few minutes he smiled coldly
while an expression of relief struggled
fleetingly to move his expressionless
face even though his screens were
better than anyone had supposed why
admit it

  baxter hartkopf chatelier anan-
drusung penrose nishimura mir-

names report to me here at once
the planetoid is lost he informed
his select group of scientists when they
had assembled and we must abandon
it in exactly fifteen minutes which will
be the time required for the robots to
fill this first section with our most nec-
essary machinery and instruments pack

each of you one box of the things he

haps a trifle less case-hardened than his
fellows at least voiced a thought for
those they were so brutally deserting

  i say it seems a bit thick to dash
off this way and leave the rest of them
but still i suppose   

  you suppose correctly bland and
heartless nishimura filled in the pause
a small part of the planetoid may be
able to escape which to me at least is
pleasantly surprising news it cannot
carry all of our men and mechanisms
therefore only the most important of
both are saved what would you for
the rest it is simply what you call the
fortune of war no

  but the beautiful  began the
amorous chatelier

  hush fool snorted hartkopf
one word of that to the ear of roger
and you too are left behind of such
non-essentials the universe is full to
be collected in times of ease but in
times hard to be disregarded und this
is a time of schrecklichkeit indeed


and through that terrific conduit came speeding package after package

of destruction
triplanetary



  the group broke up each man going
to his own quarters to meet again in
the first section a few minutes before
the zero time rogers office was
now packed so tightly with machinery
and supplies that but little room was
left for the scientists the gray mon-
strosity still sat unmoved behind his
dials

  but of what use is it roger the
russian physicist demanded those
waves are of some ultra-band of a fre-
quency immensely higher than anything
heretofore known our screens should
not have stopped them for an instant
it is a mystery that they have held so
long and certainly this single section
will not be permitted to leave the plan-
etoid without being destroyed

  there are many things you do not
know mirsky came the cold and level
answer our screens which you think
are of your own devising have several
improvements of my own in the for-
mula and would hold forever had i
the power to drive them the screens of
this section being smaller can be held
as long as will be found necessary

  power the dumfounded russian
exclaimed why we have almost in-
finite power-unlimited-sufficient for a
lifetime of high expenditure

out roger made no reply for the
time of departure was at hand
he pressed down a tiny lever and a
robot in the power room threw in
the gigantic plunger switches which
launched against the nevians the stu-
pendous beam which so upset the com-
placence of nerado the amphibian-the
beam into which was poured recklessly
every resource of power afforded by the
planetoid careless alike of burn-out and
of exhaustion then all the attention
of the nevians and the greater part of
their power output devoted to the neu-
tralization of that last desperate thrust

the metal wall of the planetoid opened
and the first section shot out into
space full-driven as they were rogers
screens flared white as he drove through
the temporarily lessened attack of the
nevians but in their preoccupation the
amphibians did not notice the additional
disturbance and the section tore on un-
observed and undetected far out in
space roger raised his eyes from the
instrument panel and continued the con-
versation as though it had not been inter-
rupted

  everything is relative mirsky and
you have misused gravely the term un-
limited our power was and is very
definitely limited true it then seemed
ample for our needs and is far supe-
rior to that possessed by the inhabitants
of any solar system with which i am
familiar but the beings behind that red
screen whoever they are have sources
of power as far above ours as ours are
above those of the solariatis

 how do you know

  that power what is it we have
then the analyses of those fields re-
corded  came simultaneous questions
and explanations

  their power-source is very probablv
the intra-atomic energy of iron and if
so much remains to be done before i
can proceed with my plan i must have
the most powerful structure in the
known universe before i can act in
the light of what i have just learned
the loss of the planetoid is but a trifle
roger as unmoved as one of his own
automatons was coldly analyzing the
situation thinking the thing through
to its logical conclusion paying no at-
tention whatever to the losses of life
time and treasure now behind him

  but what can you do about it 
growled the russian

  many things from the charts of
the recorders we can compute their
fields of force and from that point


amazing stories

it is only a step to their method of
liberating the energy we shall build
robots they shall build other robots
who shall in turn construct another
planetoid one this time that wielding
the theoretical maximum of power will
be suited to my needs

  and where will you build it we
are marked invisibility now is useless
triplanetary will find us even if we
take up an orbit beyond that of pluto
we have already left your solarian
system far behind we are going to
another system one far enough removed
so that the spy-rays of triplanetary will
never find us and yet one that we can
reach in a reasonable length of time
with the energies at our command
some fifteen days will be required for
the journey however and our quarters
are cramped therefore make places
for yourselves wherever you can and
lessen the tedium of those fifteen days
by working upon whatever problems are
most pressing in your respective re-
searches

the gray monster fell silent im-
mersed in what thoughts no one
knew and the scientists set out to obey
his orders baxter the british chem-
ist followed penrose the lantern-jawed
saturnine american engineer and in-
ventor as he made his way to the fur-
thermost cubicle of the section

  i say penrose id like to ask you
a couple of questions if you dont
mind 

  go ahead ordinarily its dangerous
to be a cackling hen anywhere around
him but he cant hear anything here
now his system is pretty well shot to
pieces you want to know all i know-
about roger

  exactly so you have been with
him so much longer than i have you
know in some ways he impresses one
as being scarcely human if you know

what i mean ridiculous of course
but of late i have been wondering
whether he really is human he knows
too much about too many things he
seems to be acquainted with many solar
systems to visit which would require
life times then too he has dropped
remarks which would imply that he ac-
tually saw things that happened long
before any living man could possibly
have been born finally he looks-
well peculiar-and certainly does not
act human i have been wondering
and have been able to learn nothing
about him as you have said such talk
as this aboard the planetoid was impos-
sible

  you neednt worry about being paid
your price thats one thing if we live
-and that was part of the agreement
you know-we will all get what we sold
out for you will become a belted earl
i have already made millions and shall
make many more similarly chatelier
has had and will have his women an-
andrusung and nishimura their cher-
ished revenges hartkopf his power and
so on he eyed the other speculatively
then went on

  i might as well spill it all since ill
never have a better chance and since
you should know what the rest of us
do youre in the same boat with us
and tarred with the same brush theres
a lot of gossip that may or may not
be true but i know one very startling
fact here it is my great-great-
grandfather left some notes which taken
in connection with certain things i my-
self saw on the planetoid prove beyond
question that our roger went to har-
vard university at the same time he
did roger was a grown man then and
the elder penrose noted that he was
marked like this and the american
sketched a cabalistic design

 what baxter exclaimed an
adept of north polar jupiter-thent
triplanetary



  yes that was before the first
jovian war you know and it was those
medicine-men-really high-caliber sci-
entists-that prolonged that war so  

  but i say penrose thats really a
bit thick when they were wiped out
it was proved a lot of hocus-pocus  

  some of it was but most of it
wasnt penrose interrupted in turn
im not asking you to believe anything
except that one fact im just telling
you the rest of it but it is also a fact
that those adepts knew things and did
things that take a lot of explaining
now for the gossip none of which is
guaranteed roger is undoubtedly of
tellurian parentage and the story is
that his father was a moon-pirate his
mother a greek adventuress when the
pirates were chased off the moon they
went to ganymede you know and some
of them were captured by the jovians
it seems that roger was born at an in-
stant of time sacred to the adepts so
they took him on he worked his way
up through the forbidden society as
all adepts did by various kinds of mur-
der and job lots of assorted deviltries
until he got clear to the top-the sev-
enty-seventh mystery    

rtvhe secret of eternal youth

  -i- gasped baxter awed in spite of
himself

  right and he stayed chief devil
in spite of all the efforts of all his am-
bitious sub-devils to kill him until the
turning-point of the first jovian war
he cut away then in a space-ship and
ever since then he has been working-
and working hard-on some stupendous
plan of his own that nobody else has
ever got even an inkling of thats the
story true or not it explains a lot
of things that no other theory can touch
and now i think youd better shuffle
along enough of this is a great
plenty

  baxter went to his own cubby and
each man of the adepts cold-blooded
crew methodically took up his task
true to prediction in fifteen days a
planet loomed beneath them and their
vessel settled through a reeking atmos-
phere toward a rocky and forbidding
plain then for another day they
plunged along a few thousand feet
above the surface of that strange world
while roger with his analytical detectors
sought the most favorable location from
which to wrest the materials necessary
for his program of construction

  it was a world of cold its sun was
distant pale and wan it had mon-
strous forms of vegetation of which
each branch and member writhed and
fought with a grotesque and horrible
individual activity ever and anon a
struggling part broke from its parent
plant and darted away in independent
existence leaping upon and consuming
or being consumed by a fellow creature
equally monstrous this flora was of
a uniform color-a lurid sickly yellow
in form some of it was fern-like some
cactus-like some vaguely tree-like but
it was all outrageous inherently repul-
sive to all solarian senses and no less
hideous were the animal-like forms of
life which slithered and slunk rapa-
ciously through that fantastic pseudo-
vegetation snake-like reptile-like bat-
like the creatures squirmed crawled
and flew each covered with a dankly
oozing yellow hide and each motivated
by twin common impulses-to kill and
insatiably and indiscriminately to de-
vour over this reeking wilderness
roger drove his vessel untouched by
its disgusting its appalling ferocity and
horror

  there should be intelligence of a
kind he mused and swept the surface
of the planet with an exploring beam
ah yes there is a city of sorts and
in a few minutes the outlaws were look-


amazing stories

ing down upon a metal-walled city of
roundly conical buildings

  inside these structures and between
and around them there scuttled form-
less blobs of matter one of which
roger brought up into his vessel by
means of a tractor ray held immovable
by the beam it lay upon the floor a
strangely extensile amoeba-like metal-
studded mass of leathery substance
of eyes ears limbs or organs it ap-
parently had none yet it radiated an
intensely hostile aura a mental efflu-
vium concentrated of rage and of
hatred

  apparently the ruling intelligence of
the planet roger commented such
creatures are useless to us we can
build robots in half the time required
for their subjugation and training
still it should not be permitted to
carry back what it may have learned
of us as he spoke the adept threw
the peculiar being out into the air and
dispassionately rayed it out of ex-
istence

  that thing reminds me of a man
i used to know back in penobscot
penrose was as coldly callous as his
unfeeling master the eyenest-tem-
pered man in town-mad all the time

eventually roger found a lo-
cation which satisfied his require-
ments of raw materials and made a
landing upon that unfriendly soil
sweeping beams denuded a great cir-
cle of life and into that circle leaped
robots robots requiring neither rest
nor food but only lubricants and power
robots insensible alike to that bitter cold
and to that noxious atmosphere

  but the outlaws were not to win a
foothold upon that inimical planet easily
nor were they to hold it without effort
through the weird vegetation of the
circles bare edge there scuttled and
poured along a horde of the metal-

studded men-if men they might be
called-who ferocity incarnate rushed
the robot line mowed down by hun-
dreds still they came on willing it
seemed to expend any number of lives in
order that one living creature might once
touch a robot with one outthrust metallic
stud whenever that happened there
was a flash as of lightning the heavy
smoke of burning insulation grease and
metal and the robot went down out of
control recalling his remaining auto-
matons roger sent out a shielding
screen against which the defenders of
their planet raged in impotent fury for
days they hurled themselves and their
every force against that impenetrable
barrier then withdrew temporarily
stopped but by no means acknowledging
defeat

  then while roger and his cohorts di-
rected affairs from within their comfort-
able and now sufficiently roomy vessel
there came into being around it an in-
dustrial city of metal peopled by metal-
lic and insensate mechanisms mines
were sunk furnaces were blown in
smelters belched forth into the already
unbearable air their sulphurous fumes
rolling mills and machine shops were
built and equipped and as fast as new
enterprises were completed additional
robots were ready to man them in
record time the heavy work of girders
members and plates was well under
way and shortly thereafter light deft
and multi-fingered mechanical men be-
gan the interminable task of building
and installing the prodigious amount of
precise machinery required for the vast
structure roger was well content but
one day he was rudely awakened from
his dream of complete isolation

  even though he had no reason to be-
lieve that there was anything dangerous
within hundreds of millions of miles it
was rogers cautious custom to release
the screens from time to time in order
triplanetary



to allow his detectors to range out this
day as he sent out his beams his hard
gray eyes grew even harder

  mirsky nishimura come here he
snapped and showed them upon his
plate an enormous sphere of steel its
rays flaming viciously is there any
doubt whatever in your minds as to the
system to which that ship belongs

  none at all-triplanetarian re-
plied the russian while larger than
any i have seen before its construction
is unmistakable they managed to
trace us and are testing out their weap-
ons before attacking do we attack or
do we run away

  if triplanetarian and it surely is
we attack coldly this one section is
armed and powered to defeat triplanet-
arys entire navy we shall take that
ship and shall add its slight resources
to our own and it may even be that
they have picked up the three who
escaped me  i have never yet been
balked for long yes we shall take
that vessel and those three sooner or
later bradley i care nothing about   
but costigan handled me    and the
woman    diamond-hard eyes glared
balefully at the urge of thoughts to a
clean and normal mind unthinkable

  to your posts he ordered the
robots will continue to function under
their automatic controls during the
short time it will require to abate this
nuisance

ne moment a strange voice
roared from the speakers con-
sider yourselves under arrest by order
of the triplanetary council surrender
and you shall receive impartial hearing
fight us and you shall never come to
trial from what we have learned of
roger we do not expect him to sur-
render but if any of you other men
wish to avoid immediate death leave

vour vessel at once we will come back


for you later

  any of you wishing to leave this
vessel have my full permission to do so
roger announced disdaining any reply
to the challenge of the boise any
such however will not be allowed in-
side the planetoid area after the rest of
us return from wiping out that patrol
we attack in one minute

  would not one do better by stopping
on baxter in the quarters of the
american was in doubt as to the most
profitable course to pursue i should
leave immediately if i thought that that
ship could win but i do not fancy that
it can do you

  that ship one triplanetary ship
against us penrose laughed raucously
do as you please id go in a minute
if i thought that there was any chance
of us losing but there isnt so im stay-
ing i know which side my breads but-
tered on those cops are bluffing thats
all not bluffing exactly either because
theyll go through with it as long as they
last foolish but its a way they have
-theyll die trying every time instead of
running away even when they know
theyre licked before they start they
dont use good judgment

  none of you are leaving very well
you each know what to do came rog-
ers emotionless voice the stipulated
minute having elapsed he advanced a
lever and the outlaw cruiser slid quietly
into the air

  toward the poised boise roger
steered within range he flung out a
weapon new-learned and supposedly ir-
resistible to any ferrous thing or crea-
ture the red converter-field of the nev-
ians for rogers analytical detectors
had stood him in good stead during those
frightful minutes in the course of which
the planetoid had borne the brunt of
nerados superhuman attack in such
good stead that from the records of those


amazing

stories

ingenius instruments he and his scien-
tists had been able to reconstruct not
only the generators of the attacking
forces but also the screens employed by
the amphibians in the neutralization of
similar beams with a vastly inferior
armament the smallest of rogers ves-
sels had defeated the most powerful
battleships of triplanetary what had he
to fear in such a heavy craft as the
one he now was driving one so superla-
tively armed and powered well it was
for his peace of mind that he had no
inkling that the harmless-looking sphere
he was so blithely attacking was in
reality the much-discussed half-mythical
super-ship of triplanetarys secret
service- nor that its already unprece-
dented armament had been reenforced
thanks to that hated costigan with rog-
ers own every worth-while idea as well
as with every weapon and defense
known to that arch-nevian nerado

unknowing and contemptuous
rbger launched his converter field
and instantly found himself fighting for
his very life for from rodebush at
the controls down the men of the secret
service countered with wave after wave
and with salvo after salvo of vibratory
and material destruction no thought
of mercy for the men of the pirate ship
could enter their minds the outlaws
had each been given a chance to sur-
render and each had refused it re-
fusing they knew as the triplanetarians
knew and as all modern readers know
meant that they were staking their lives
upon victory for with modern arma-
ments it is seldom indeed that a single
man lives through the defeat in battle
of a war-vessel of space

  roger launched his field of red opac-
ity but it did not reach even boises
screens all space seemed to explode
into violet spendor as rodebush neutra-

lized it drove it back with his obliter-
ating zone of force but even that all-
devouring zone could not touch rogers
peculiarly efficient screen the outlaw
vessel stood out unharmed ultra-violet
infra-red pure heat infra-sound solid
beams of high-tension high-frequency
current in whose paths the most stub-
born metals would be volatilized instant-
ly  all iron-driven every deadly and
torturing vibration known was hurled
against that screen but it too was iron-
driven and it held even the awful
force of the macrobeam was dissipated
by it-reflected hurled away on all sides
in coruscating torrents of blinding dazz-
ling energy cooper adlington spen-
cer and dutton hurled against it their
bombs and torpedoes-and still it held
but rogers fiercest blasts and heaviest
projectiles were equally impotent against
the force-snields of the super-ship the
adept having no liking for a battle upon
anything like equal terms sought safety
in flight only to be brought to a crash-
ing stunning halt by a massive tractor
beam

  that must be that sixth-phase poly-
cyclic screen that conway reported on
cleveland frowned in thought ive been
doing a lot of work on that and i
think ive calculated an opener for it
fred but ill have to have number ten
projector and the whole output of num-
ber ten power room can you let me
play with that much juice for a while
all right blake tune her up to fifty-five
thousand-there hold it now you
other fellows listen im going to try
to drill a hole through that screen with
a hollow quasi-solid beam like a dia-
mond drill cutting out a core you
wont be able to shove anything into the
hole from outside the beam so youll
have to steer your cans out through the
central orifice of number ten projector
-thatll be cold since im going to use
only the edge i dont know how long
triplanetary



ill be able to hold the hole open though
so shoot them along as fast as you
can ready here goes

  he pressed a series of contacts far
below in number ten converter room
massive switches drove home and the
enormous mass of the vessel quivered
under the terrific reaction of the newly-
calculated semi-material beam of energy
that was hurled out backed by the
mightiest of all the mighty converters
and generators of triplanetarys super-
dreadnaught that beam a pipe-like
hollow cylinder of intolerable energy
flashed out and there was a rending
tearing crash as it struck rogers hither-
to impenetrable wall struck and clung
grinding boring in while from the rag-
ing inferno that marked the circle of
contact of cylinder and shield the pirates
screen radiated scintillating torrents of
cracking streaming sparks lightning-
like in length and in intensity

deeper and deeper the gigantic
drill was driven it was through
pierced rogers polycyclic screen ex-
posed the bare metal of rogers walls
and now concentrated upon one point
flamed out in seemingly redoubled fury
triplanetarys raging rays-in vain
for even as they could not penetrate
the screen neither could they penetrate
the wall of clevelands drill but re-
bounded from it in the cascaded bril-
liance of thwarted lightning

  oh what a dumb-bell i am groaned
cleveland why oh why didnt i have
somebody rig up a secondary sx beam
on tens inner rings hop to it will
you blake so that well have it in case
they are able to stop the cans

  but the pirates could not stop all of
triplanetarys projectiles now hurrying
along inside the pipe as fast as they
could be driven in fact for a few
minutes desperate roger knowing that
he faced his long lifes gravest crisis

paid no attention to them at all nor to
any of his own useless offensive weap-
ons he struggled only and madly to
break away from the savage grip of the
boises tractor rod futile he could
neither cut nor stretch that inexorably
anchoring beam then he devoted his
every resource to the closing of that
unbelievable breach in his shield the
barrier which through all previous em-
ergencies had kept death at bay equally
futile his most desperate efforts re-
sulted only in more frenzied displays
of incandescence along the curved sur-
face of contact of that penetrant cylin-
der and through that terrific conduit
came speeding package after package of
destruction bombs and armor-piercing
shells gas shells and shells of poisonous
and corrosive fluids followed each other
in close succession the surviving scien-
tists of the planetoid expert gunners
and ray-men all destroyed many of the
projectiles but it was not humanly pos-
sible to frustrate them all and the
breach could not be forced shut against
the all but irresistible force of cleve-
lands opener and with all his
power roger could not shift hi vessels
position in the grip of triplanetarys
tractors sufficiently to bring a projector
to bear upon the super-ship along the
now unprotected axis of that narrow
but deadly tube

thus it was that the end came soon
a war-head touched steel plating
and there ensued a world-wracking ex-
plosion of atomic iron gaping wide
helpless with all defenses down other
torpedoes entered the stricken hulk and
completed its destruction even before
they could be recalled explosive bombs
literally tore the pirate vessel to frag-
ments while vials of pure corrosion dis-
solved her substance into dripping cor-
ruption and reeking gases filled every
cranny of the wreckage as its torn and


amazing stories

dismembered fragments began their long
plunge to the ground the space-ship
followed the pieces down and rode-
bush sent out an exploring ray

        resistance was such that it
was necessary to use corrosive and ship
and contents were completely disinteg-
rated he dictated into his vessels log
some time later while there were of
course no remains recognisable as hu-
man it is practically certain that roger
and his last eleven men died

   look here fred cleveland called
his attention to the plate upon which
was pictured a horde of the peculiar
inhabitants of the ghastly planet wreak-
ing their frenzied electrical wrath upon
everything within the circle bared by
roger i was just going to suggest that
we clean up that planetoid roger started
but i see that the local boys are at-
tending to it

   just as well perhaps i would like
to stay and study these people a little
while but we must get back on the
trail of the nevians and the boise
leaped away into space toward the line
of flight of the amphibians

they reached that line and along
it they traveled at full normal blast
as they traveled their detecting receivers
and amplifiers were reaching out with
their utmost power ultra-instruments
capable of rendering audible any signal
originating within many light-years of
them upon any known frequency and
constantly at least two men were listen-
ing to those instruments with every
sense concentrated in their ears listen-
ing-straining to distinguish in the deaf-
ening roar of background noise from the
over-driven tubes any sign of voice or
signal listening-while millions upon
untold millions of miles beyond even
the prodigious reach of those ultra-in-
struments three human beings pitted
against overwhelming odds were even

then sending out into empty space an
almost hopeless appeal for the aid so
desperately needed

chapter xii
the specimens escape

knowing well that conversation
with its fellows is one of the great-
est needs of any intelligent being
the nevians had permitted the terrestrial
specimens to retain possession of their
ultra-beam communicators thus it was
that costigan had been able to keep in
touch with his sweetheart and with brad
ley he learned that each had been placed
upon exhibition in a different nevian
city that the three had been separated
in response to an insistent popular de-
mand for such a distribution of the pe-
culiar but highly interesting creatures
from a distant solar system they had
not been harmed in fact each was
visited daily by a specialist who made
sure that his charge was being kept in
the pink of condition

  as soon as he became aware of this
condition of things costigan became
morose he sat still drooped and pined
away visibly he refused to eat and
of the worried specialist he demanded
liberty then failing in that as he knew
he would fail he demanded something to
do they pointed out to him reason-
ably enough that in such a civilization
as theirs there was nothing he could do
they assured him that they would do
anything they could to alleviate his men-
tal suffering but that since he was a
museum piece he must see himself that
he must be kept on display for a short
time wouldnt he please behave him-
self and eat as a reasoning being should
costigan sulked a little longer then wav-
ered finally he agreed to compromise
he would eat and exercise if they would
fit up a laboratory in his apartment so
triplanetary



that he could continue the studies he had
begun upon his own native planet to
this they agreed and thus it came about
that one day the following conversation
was held

  clio bradley ive got something
to tell you this time havent said any-
thing before for fear things might not
work out but they did i went on a
hunger strike and made them give me a
complete laboratory as a chemist im
a darn good electrician but luckily with
the sea-water theyve got here its a very
simple thing to make   

  hold on snapped bradley some-
body may be listening in on us

  they arent they cant without my
knowing it and ill cut off the second
anybody tries to synchronize with my
beam to resume-making vee-two is
a very simple process and ive got every-
thing around here thats hollow clear full
of it  

  how come they let you asked clio

  oh they dont know what im doing
they watched me for a few days and
all i did was make up and bottle the
weirdest messes imaginable then i
finally managed to separate oxygen and
nitrogen after trying hard all of one
day and when they thought they saw
that i didnt know anything about either
one of them or what to do with them
after i had them they gave me up in
disgust as a plain dumb ape and havent
paid any attention to me since so ive
got me plenty of kilograms of liquid vee-
two all ready to touch off im getting
out of here in about three minutes and
a half and im coming over after you
folks in a new iron-powered space-
speedster that they dont know i know
anything about theyve just given it
its final tests and its the slickest thing
you ever saw

ut conway dearest you cant pos-
sibly rescue me clios voice

broke why there are thousands of
them all around here if you can get
away go dear but dont    

  i said i was coming after you and
if i can get away ill be there a good
whiff of this stuff will lay out a thou-
sand of them just as easily as it will one
heres the idea ive made a gas mask
for myself since ill be in it where its
thick but you two wont need any the
gas is soluble enough in water so that
three or four thicknesses of wet cloth
over your noses will be enough ill tell
you when to wet down were going to
break away or go out trying-there
arent enough amphibians between here
and andromeda to keep us humans coop-
ed up like menagerie animals forever
but here comes my specialist with the
keys to the city time for the overture
to start see you later

  the nevian physician directed his key-
tube upon the transparent wall of the
chamber and an opening appeared an
opening which vanished as soon as he
had stepped through it costigan kicked
a valve open and from various innocent
tubes there belched forth into the water
of the central lagoon and into the air
over it a flood of deadly vapor as the
nevian turned toward the prisoner there
was an almost inaudible hiss and a tiny
jet of the frightful outlawed stuff struck
his open gills just below his huge coni-
cal head he tensed momentarily
twitched convulsively just once and fell
motionless to the floor and outside
the streams of avidly soluble liquefied
gas rushed out into air and into water

the extreme mobility which is one of its
characteristics and as it diffused and was

success of his plan of escape held his
breath and grimly alert watched the am-
phibians die when he could see no more
motion anywhere he donned his gas-mask
strapped upon his back a large canister
of the poison-his capacious pockets were
already full of smaller containers-and
two savagely exultant sentences escaped
him

  i am a poor ignorant specimen of
ape that can be let play with apparatus
am i he rasped as he picked up the
keytube of the specialist and opened the
door of his prison maybe theyll learn
sometime that it aint always safe to
judge by the looks of a flea how far he
can jump

  he stepped out through the opening
into the water and burdened as he was
made shift to swim to the nearest ramp
up it he ran toward a main corridor
but ahead of him there was wafted a
breath of dread vee-two and where that
breath went went also unconsciousness
-an unconsciousness which would deep-
en gradually into permanent oblivion save
for the prompt intervention of one who
possessed not only the necessary anti-
dote but the equally important knowl-
edge of exactly how to use it upon
the floor of that corridor were strewn
nevians who had dropped in their tracks
past or over their bodies costigan strode
pausing only to direct a jet of lethal
vapor into whatever branching corridor
or open doorway caught his eye he
was going to the intake of the citys
ventilation plant and no unmasked crea-
ture dependent for life upon oxygen could
bar his path he reached the intake
tore the canister from his back and re-
leased its full vast volume of horrid
contents into the primary air stream of
the entire city

and all throughout that doomed city
nevians dropped quietly and with-
out a struggle unknowing busy execu-

tives dropped upon their cushioned fiat-
topped desks hurrying travelers and
messengers dropped upon the floors of
the corridors or relaxed in the noxious
waters of the ways lookouts and ob-
servers dropped before their flashing
screens central operators of communica-
tions dropped under the winking lights
of their panels observers and centrals
in the outlying sections of the city won-
dered briefly at the unwonted universal
motionlessness and stagnation then the
racing taint in water and in air reached
them too and they ceased wondering-
forever

  then through those quiet halls costi-
gan stalked to a certain storage room
where with all due precaution he donned
his own suit of triplanetary armor
making an ungainly bundle of the other
solarian equipment stored there he
dragged it along behind him as he
clanked back toward his prison until he
neared the dock at which was moored
the nevian space-speedster which he was
determined to take here he knew was
the first of many critical points the
crew of the vessel was aboard and with
its independent air-supply unharmed
they had weapons were undoubtedly
alarmed and were very probably highly
suspicious they too had ultra-beams
and might see him but his very closeness
to them would tend to protect him from
ultra-beam observation therefore he
crouched tensely behind a buttress star-
ing through his spy-ray goggles waiting
for a moment when none of the nevians
would be near the entrance but grimly
resolved to act instantly should he feel
any touch of a spying ultra-beam

  heres where the pinch comes he
growled to himself i know the com-
bination but if theyre suspicious enough
and act quick enough they can seal that
door on me before i can get it open and
then rub me out like a blot but 
ah
triplanetary



  the moment had arrived before the
touch of any revealing ray he trained
the key-tube the entrance opened and
through that opening in the instant of its
appearance there shot a brittle bulb of
glass whose breaking meant death it
crashed into fragments against a metallic
wall and costigan entering the vessel
consigned its erstwhile crew one by one
to the already crowded waters of the
lagoon he then leaped to the controls
and drove the captured speedster through
the air to plunge it down upon the sur-
face of the lagoon beside the door of the
isolated structure which had for so long
been his prison carefully he transferred
to the vessel the motley assortment of
containers of vee-two and after a quick
check-up to make sure that he had over-
looked nothing he shot his craft straight
up into the air then only did he close
his ultra-wave circuits and speak

  clio bradley-i got away clean with-
out a bit of trouble now im coming
after you clio

  oh its wonderful that you got away
conway the girl exclaimed but
hadnt you better get captain bradley
first then if anything should happen
he would be of some use while i   

  ill knock him into an outside loop
if he does the captain snorted and
costigan went on

  you wont need to you come first
clio of course but youre too far away
for me to see you with my spy and i
dont want to use the high-powered beam
of this boat for fear of detection so
youd better keep on talking so that i can
trace you

     hats one thing i am good at
a clio laughed in sheer relief if
talking were music id be a full brass
band and she kept up a flow of incon-
sequential chatter until costigan told her
that it was no longer necessary that he
had established the line

	any excitement around there yet 
he asked her then

   nothing unusual that i can see she
replied why should there be some
i hope not but when i made my get-
away i couldnt kill them all of course
and i thought maybe they might con-
nect things up with my jail-break and tell
the other cities to take steps about you
two but i guess theyre pretty well dis-
organized back there yet since they cant
know who hit them or what with or
why i must have got about everybody
that wasnt sealed up somewhere and
it doesnt stand to reason that those who
are left can check up very closely for a
while yet but theyre nobodys fools-
theyll certainly get conscious when i
snatch you maybe before  there i
see your city i think

   what are you going to do 

  same as i did back there if i can
poison their primary air and all the water
i can reach   

  oh conway her voice rose to a
scream they must know-theyre all
getting out of the water and are rushing
inside the buildings as fast as they pos-
sibly can

  i see they are grimly im right
over you now way up been locating
their primary intake theyve got a
dozen ships around it and have guards
posted all along the corridors leading to
it and those guards are wearing masks
theyre clever birds all right those am-
phibians-they know what they got back
there and how they got it that changes
things girl if we use gas here we wont
stand a chance in the world of getting
old bradley stand by to jump when i
open that door

  hurry dear they are coming out
here after me

  sure they are costigan had al-
ready seen the two nevians swimming
out toward clios cage and had hurled
his vessel downward in a screaming

power dive youre too valuable a
specimen for them to let you be gassed
but if they can get there before i do
theyre traveling fast

  he miscalculated slightly so that in-
stead of coming to a halt at the surface
of the liquid medium the speedster struck
with a crash that hurled solid masses of
water for hundreds of yards but no
ordinary crash could harm that vessels
structure her gravity controls were not
overloaded and she shot back to the sur-
face gallant ship and reckless pilot alike
unharmed costigan trained his key-
tube upon the doorway of clios cell then
tossed it aside

  different combinations over here he
barked got to cut you out-lie down
in that far corner

  his hands flashed over the panel and
as clio fell prone without hesitation or
question a heavy beam literally blasted
away a large portion of the roof of the
structure the speedster shot into the
air and dropped down until she rested
upon the tops of opposite walls walls
still glowing semi-molten the girl piled
a stool upon the table and stood upon
it reached upward and seized the mailed
hands extended downward toward her
costigan heaved her up into the vessel
with a powerful jerk slammed the door
shut leaped to the controls and the speed-
ster darted away

 your armors in that bundle there
better put it on and check your
lewistons and pistols-no telling what
kind of jams well get into he snapped
without turning bradley start talking
  all right ive got your line better
get your wet rags ready and get organ-
ized generally-every second will count
by the time we get there were coming
so fast that our outer platings white hot
but it may not be fast enough at that

  it isnt fast enough quite bradley

announced calmly theyre coming out
after me now

  dont fight them and probably they
wont paralyze you keep on talking
so that i can find out where they take
you

  no good costigan the voice of
the old space-flea did not reveal a sign
of emotion as he made his dread an-
nouncement they have it all figured
out theyre not taking any chances at
all-theyre going to paral    his
voice broke off in the middle of the word

  with a bitter imprecation costigan
flashed on the powerful ultra-beam pro-
jector of the speedster and focused the
plate upon bradleys prison careless now
of detection since the nevians were al-
ready warned upon that plate he watched
the nevians carry the helpless body of
the captain into a small boat and con-
tinued to watch as they bore it into one
of the largest buildings of the city up
a series of ramps they took the still form
placing it finally upon a soft couch in
an enormous and heavily guarded central
hall costigan turned to his companion
clio and even through the helmets she
could see plainly the white agony of his
expression he moistened his lips and
tried twice to speak-tried and failed
but he made no move either to cut off
their power or to change their direc-
tion

  of course she approved steadily
we are going through i know that
you want to run with me but if you actu-
ally did it i would never want to see
you or hear of you again and you would
hate me forever

  hardly that the anguish did not
leave his eyes and his voice was hoarse
and strained but his hands did not vary
the course of the speedster by so much
as a hairs breadth youre the finest
little fellow that ever waved a plume
and i would love you no matter what
happened id trade my immortal soul
triplanetary



to the devil if it would get you out of this
mess but were both in it up to our necks
and we cant dog it now if they kill
him we beat it-he and i both knew that
it was on the chance of that happening
that i took you first-but as long as all
three of us are alive its all three or
none

   of course she said again as steadily
thrilled this time to the depths of her
being by the sheer manhood of him who
had thus simply voiced his code a man
of such fiber that neither love of life nor
the infinitely more powerful love of her
which she knew he bore could make him
lower its high standard

  we are going through forget that
i am a woman we are three human
beings fighting a world full of monsters

i	am simply one of us three i will steer
your ship fire your projectors or throw
your bombs what can i do best

  throw bombs he directed briefly
he knew what must be done were they
to have even the slightest chance of win-
ning clear im going to blast a hole
down into the auditorium and when i do
you stand by that port and start drop-
ping bottles of perfume throw a cou-
ple ol big ones right down the shaft i
make and the rest of them most any-
where after i cut the wall open theyll
do good wherever they hit land or
water

  but captain bradley-hell be gassed
too her fine eyes were troubled

a nt be helped ive got the anti-
dote and itll work any time under
an hour thatll be lots of time-if we
arent gone in less than ten minutes well
be staying here theyre bringing in
platoons of militia in full armor and if
we dont beat those boys to it were in
for plenty of grief all right-start
throwing

  the speedster had come to a halt di-
rectly over the imposing edifice within

  which bradley was incarcerated and a
mighty beam had flared downward dig-
ging a fiery well through floor after floor
of stubborn metal the ceiling of the
amphitheater pierced the beam expired
and down into that assembly hall there
dropped two canisters of vee-two to
crash and to fill its atmosphere with im-
perceptible death then the beam flashed
on again this time at maximum power
and with it costigan burned away half
of the gigantic building burned it away
until room above room gaped open shelf-
like to outer atmosphere the great hall
now resembling an over-size pigeon-hole
surrounded by smaller ones into that
largest pigeon-hole the speedster darted
and cushioned desks and benches crashed
down crushed flat under its enormous
weight as it came to rest upon the floor

  every available guard had been thrown
into that room regardless of customary
occupation or of equipment most of
them had been ordinary watchmen not
even wearing masks and all such were
already down many however were pro-
tected by masks and a few were dressed
in full armor but no portable armor
could mount defenses of sufficient power
to withstand the awful force of the
speedsters weapons and one flashing
swing of a projector swept the hall almost
clear of life

  cant shoot very close to bradley with
this big beam but ill mop up on the
rest of them by hand stay here and
cover me clio costigan ordered and
went to open the door

  i cant-i wont clio replied in-
stantly i dont know the controls well
enough id kill you or captain brad-
ley sure but i can shoot and im going
to and she leaped out close upon his
heels

  thus flaming lewiston in one hand
and barking automatic in the other the
two mailed figures advanced toward brad-
ley now doubly helpless paralyzed by


amazing stories

  his enemies and gassed by his friends
for a time the nevians melted away be-
fore them but as they approached more
nearly the couch upon which the captain
was they encountered six figures encased
in armor fully as capable as their own
the beams of the lewistons rebounded
from that armor in futile pyrotechnics
the bullets of the automatics spattered
and exploded impotently against it and
behind that single line of armored guards
were massed perhaps twenty unarmored
but masked soldiers and scuttling up
the ramps leading into the hall were com-
ing the platoons of heavily-armored
figures which costigan had previously
seen

  decision instantly made costigan ran
back toward the speedster but he was
not deserting his companions

  keep the good work up he instruct-
ed the girl as he ran ill pick those
jaspers off with a pencil ray and then
stand off the bunch thats coming while
you rub out the rest of that crew there
and drag bradley back here

back at the control panel he trained
a narrow but intensely dense pencil
of livid flame and one by one the six
armored figures fell then knowing that
clio could handle the remaining opposi-
tion he devoted his attention to the
reenforcements so rapidly approaching
from the sides again and again the
heavy beam lashed out now upon this
side now upon that and in its flaming
path nevians disappeared and not only
nevians-in the incrcdible energy of that
beams blast floor walls ramps and
every material thing vanished in clouds
of thick and brilliant vapor the room
temporarily clear of foes he sprang again
to clios assistance but her task was
nearly done she had rubbed out all
opposition and tugging lustily at brad-
leys feet had already dragged him al-
most to the side of the speedster

    at-a-girl clio cheered costigan
as he picked up the burly captain and
tossed him through the doorway high-
ly useful girl of my dreams as well as
ornamental in with you and well start
out to go places

  but getting the speedster out of the
nowr completely ruined hall proved to be
much more of a task than driving it in
had been for scarcely had the terres-
trials closed their locks than a section of
the building collapsed behind them cut-
ting off their retreat nevian submarines
and airships were beginning to arrive
upon the scene and were raying the build-
ing viciously in an attempt to entrap or
to crush the terrestrials in its ruins
costigan managed finally to kast his way
out but the nevians had had time to as-
semble in force and he was met by a
concentrated storm of beams and of
metal from every inimical weapon within
range

  but not for nothing had conway cos-
tigan selected for his dash for liberty the
craft which save only for the two im-
mense interstellar cruisers was the most
powerful vessel ever built upon red
nevia and not for nothing had he
studied minutely and to the last least
detail every item of its controls and of
its armament during wearily long days
and nights of solitary imprisonment he
had studied it under test in action  d
at rest studied it until he knew thor-
oughly its every possibility-and what a
ship it was the iron-driven generators
of his shielding screens handled with ease
the terrific load of the nevians assault
his polycyclic screens were proof against
any material projectile and the machines
supplying his offensive beams with power
were more than equal to their tasks
driven now at full rating those frightful
weapons lashed out against the nevian
blocking the way and under their im-
pacts her screens flared brilliantly
through the spectrum and went down
triplanetary



and in the instant of their failure the
enemy vessel was literally blown into
nothingness-no unprotected metal how-
ever resistant could exist for a moment
in the pathway of those iron-driven tor-
nadoes of pure energy

  ship after ship of the nevians plunged
toward the speedster in desperately sui-
cidal attempts to ram her down but each
met the same flaming fate before its mass
could collide with the ship of the ter-
restrials then from the grouped sub-
marines far below there reached up red
rods of force which seized the space-
ship and began relentlessly to draw her
down

  what are they doing that for con-
way they cant fight us

  they dont want to fight us they
want to hold us but i know what to do
about that too and the powerful tracn
tor rods snapped as a plane of lurid
light drove through them upward now
at the highest permissible velocity the
speedster leaped and past the few ships
remaining above her she dodged there
was nothing now between her and the
freedom of boundless space

  you did it conway you did it
clio exulted oh conway youre just
simply wonderful

t havent done it yet costigan
a cautioned her the worst is yet to
come nerado hes why they wanted
to hold us back and why i was in such
a hurry to get away that boat of his
is bad medicine girl and we want to put
plenty of kilometers behind us before he
gets started

  but do you think he will chase us
think so i know so the mere
facts that we are rare specimens and
that he told us that we were going to stay
there all the rest of our lives would
make him chase us clear to dustheimers
nebula besides that we stepped on their
toes pretty heavily before we left we

know altogether too much now to be let
get back to tellus and finally theyd all
die of acute enlargement of the spleen
if we get away with this prize ship of
theirs i hope to tell you theyll chase
us i

  he fell silent devoting his whole at-
tention to his piloting driving his craft
onward at such velocity that its outer
plating held steadily at the highest point
of temperature compatible with safety
soon they were out in open space hurtl-
ing toward the sun under the drive of
every possible iota of power and costi-
gan took off his armor and turned to-
ward the helpless body of the captain

  he looks so  so  so dead
conway are you really sure that you
can bring him to

  absolutely lots of time yet just
three simple squirts in the right places
will do the trick he took from a locked
compartment of his armor a small steel
box which housed a surgeons hypoder-
mic and three vials one two three
he injected small but precisely measured
amounts of the fluids into the three vital
localities then placed the inert form upon
a deeply cushioned couch

  there thatll take care of the gas
in five or six hours the paralysis will
wear off before that so hell be all right
when he wakes up and were going away
from here with every watt of power we
can put out we have done everything
i know how to do for the present

  then only did costigan turn and look
down directly into clios eyes wide
eloquent blue eyes that gazed back up
into his tender and unafraid eyes
freighted with the oldest message of
woman to chosen man his hard young
face softened wonderfully as he stared
at her there were two quick steps and
they were in each others arms clios
lithely rounded form nestled against cos-
tigans powerful body as his mighty arms
tightened around her his neck and shoul-

der were no less enthusiastically clasped
and less strongly only because of her
womans slighter musculature lips upon
eager lips blue eyes to gray motionless
they stood clasped in ecstasy thinking
nothing of the dreadful past nothing of
the fearful future conscious only of the
glorious the wonderful present

lio mine  darling  girl
v-girl how i love you costigans
deep voice was husky with emotion i
havent kissed you for seven thousand
years i dont rate you by hundreds
of steps but if i can just get you out
of this mess i swear by all the
space    

  you neednt lover rate me good
heavens conway its just the other
way    

  chop it he commanded in her ear
im still dizzy at the idea of your loving
me at all to say nothing of loving me
this way but you do and thats all i
ask here or hereafter

  love you love you their mu-
tual embrace tightened and her low voice
thrilled brokenly as she went on con-
way dearest  i cant say a thing
but you know  oh conway

after a time clio drew a long and
tremulous but supremely happy
breath as the realities of their predica-
ment once more obtruded themselves upon
her consciousness she released herself
gently from costigans arms

  do you really think that there is a
chance of us getting back to the earth
so that we can be together  always 
a chance yes a probability no
he replied unequivocally it depends
upon two things first how much of
a start we got on nerado his ship is
the biggest and fastest thing i ever saw
and if he strips her down and drives
her-which he will-hell catch us long
before we can make tellus on the

other hand i gave rodebush a lot of
data and if he and lyman cleveland
can add it to their own stuff and get that
super-ship of ours rebuilt in time theyll
be out here on the prowl and theyll
have what can give even nerado plenty
of argument no use worrying about
it anyway we wont know anything
until we can detect one or the other of
them and then will be the time to do
something about it

  if nerado catches us will you    
she paused

  rub you out i will not even if
he does catch us and takes us back to
nevia i wont theres lots more time
coming onto the clock nerado wont
hurt either of us badly enough to leave
scars either physical mental or moral
id kill you in a second if it were roger
hes dirty and hes thoroughly bad but
nerados a good enough old scout in
his way hes big and hes clean you
know i could really like that fish if i
could meet him on terms of equality
sometime 

  i couldnt she declared vigorously
hes crawly and scaly and snaky and
he smells so  so  

  so rank and fishy costigan laughed
deeply details girl mere details ive
seen people who looked like money in
the bank and who smelled like a bouquet
of violets that you couldnt trust half
the length of nerados neck

  but look what he did to us she
protested and they werent trying to
recapture us back there  they were try-
ing to kill us

  that was perfectly all right what he-
did and what they did-what else could
they have done he wanted to know
and while youre looking look at what
we did to them-plenty id say but
we all had it to do and neither side will
blame the other for doing it hes a
square shooter i tell you
triplanetary



tt tell maybe but i dont like him

  v y a bit and lets not talk about him
any more lets talk about us remem-
ber what you said once when you ad-
vised me to let you lay or whatever
it was woman-like she wished to
dip again lightly into the waters of pure
emotion even though she had such a
short time before led the man out of
their profoundest depths but costigan
into whose hard lfe love of woman had
never before entered had not yet recov-
ered sufficiently from his soul-shaking
plunge to follow her lead inarticulate
distrusting his newly found supreme hap-
piness he must needs stay out of those
enchanted waters or plunge again and
he was afraid to plunge-diffident still
deeming himself unworthy of the mira-
cle of this wonder-girls love-even
though every fiber of his being shrieked
its demand to feel again that slender
body in his clasping arms he did not
consciously think those thoughts he
acted them without thinking they were
inherent in his personality

  i do remember and i still think its
a sound idea even though i am too far
gone now to let you put it into effect
he assured her half seriously he kissed
her tenderly and reverently then studied
her carefully but you look as though
youd been on a martian picnic when
did you eat last

  i dont remember exactly this
morning i think

  or maybe last night or yesterday
morning i thought so bradley and
i can eat anything thats chewable and
drink anything that will pour but you
cant ill scout around and see if i
cant fix up something that youll be able
to eat

  he rummaged through the store-rooms
emerging with sundry viands from which
he prepared a highly satisfactory meal

think you can sleep now sweet-
heart after supper once more within

the circle of costigans arms clio nodded
her head against his shoulder

  of course i can dear now that
you are with me out here alone im not
a bit afraid any more you will get us
back to the earth some way sometime
i just know that you will good-night
conway

  good-night clio  little sweet-
heart he whispered and went back to
bradleys side

  in due time the captain recovered con-
sciousness and slept then for days
the speedster flashed on toward our dis-
tant solar system days during which her
wide-flung detector screens remained
cold

  i dont know whether im afraid
theyll hit something or afraid that they
wont costigan remarked more than
once but finally those tenuous sentinels
did in fact encounter an interfering vi-
bration along the detector line a visi-
beam sped and costigans face hardened
as he saw the unmistakable outline of
nerados interstellar cruiser far behind
them

  well a stern chase always was a long
one costigan said finally he cant
catch us for plenty of days yet  
now what for the alarms of the de-
tectors had broken out anew there was
still another point of interference to be
investigated costigan traced it and
there almost dead ahead of them between
them and their sun nearing them at the
incomprehensible rate of the sum of the
two vessels velocities came another
cruiser of the nevians

  must be the sister-ship coming back
from our system with a load of iron
costigan deduced heavily loaded as
she is we may be able to dodge her and
shes coming so fast that if we can stay
out of her range well be all right-she
wont be able to stop for probably three
or four days but if our super-ship is


amazing stories

anywhere in these parts nows the time
for her to rally round

  he gave the speedster all the side-
thrust she would take then putting every
available communicator tube behind a
tight beam he drove it sunward and be-
gan sending out a long-continued call to
his fellows of triplanetarys secret
service

nearer and nearer the nevian
flashed trying with all her power
to intercept the speedster and it soon
became evident that heavily laden though
she was she could make enough sideway
to bring her within range at the time of
meeting

  of course theyve got partial neu-
tralization of inertia the same as we
have costigan cogitated and by the
way hes coming id say that he had
orders to blow us out of the ether-he
knows as well as we do that he cant
capture us alive at anything like the rela-
tive velocities weve got now i cant
give her any more side thrust without
overloading the gravity controls so over-
loaded theyve got to be strap down
you two because they may go out en-
tirely

  do you think that you can pull away
from them conway clio was staring
in horrified fascination into the plate
watching the pictured vessel increase in
size moment by moment

  i dont know girl but im going to
try just in case we dont though im
going to keep on yelling for help in
solid all right boat do your
stuff

chapter xiii
the meeting of the giants

 heck your blast fred i think
i hear something trying to come
through cleveland called out
sharply for days the boise had torn

through the illimitable reaches of empty
space and now the long vigil of the keen-
eared listeners was to be ended rode-
bush cut off his power and through the
deafening roar of tube-noise an almost
inaudible voice made itself heard

      all the help you can give us
samms-cleveland-rodebush-anybody
of triplanetary who can hear me listen
this is costigan with mis marsden and
captain bradley heading for where we
think the sun is from right ascension
about six hours declination about plus
fourteen degrees distance unknown
but probably hundreds of light-years
trace my call one nevian ship is over-
hauling us slowly another is coming to-
ward us from the sun we may or may
not be able to dodge it but we need all
the help you can give us samms-rode-
bush-cleveland-anybody of triplane-
tary   

  endlessly the faint faint voice went
on but rodebush and cleveland were
no longer listening sensitive ultra-loops
had been swung and along the indicated
line shot triplanetarys super-ship at a
velocity which she had never before even
approached the utterly incomprehensi-
ble almost incalculable velocity attained
by inertialess matter driven through an
almost perfect vacuum by the boises
maximum projector blast-a blast which
would lift her stupendous normal ton-
nage against a gravity five times that of
earths at the full frightful measure
of that velocity the super-ship literally
annihilated distance while ahead of her
the furiously driven but scarcely faster
spy-ray beam tore on in quest of the
three terrestrials who were calling for
help

  got any idea how fast were going
rodebush demanded glancing up for an
instant from the observation plate we
should be able to see him since we could
hear him and our range is certainly as
great as anything he can have
triplanetary



  no cant figure velocity without any
reliable data on how many atoms of mat-
ter exist per cubic meter out here
cleveland was staring at the calculator
its constant of course at the value at
which the friction of the medium is equal
to our thrust incidentally we cant hold
it long were running a temperature
which shows that were stepping along
faster than anybody ever computed be-
fore taking throckmortons estimates
it figures somewhere near the order of
magnitude of ten to the twenty-seventh
fast enough anyway so youd better
bend an eye on that plate even after
you see him you wont know anything
about where he really is because we
dont know any of the velocities involved
-our own his or that of the beam-
and we may be right on top of him
or if we are outrunning the beam
wc wont see him at all that makes it
nice piloting

  how are you going to handle things
when we get there 

  lock to them and take them aboard
if were in time if not if they are fight-
ing already-there they are

  the picture of the speedsters control
room flashed upon the plate and costi-
gans voice greeted them from the
speaker

  hello fellows welcome to our city
where are you 

tt e dont know cleveland snapped
w back and we dont know where
you are either cant figure anything
without data i see youre still breathing
air where are the nevians how
much time we got yet

  not enough im afraid by the looks
of things they will be within range of
us in a couple of hours and youre so
far away yet that it took our voices four
minutes and about fifty seconds to make
the round trip on the ultra play that
on your calculator lyman you havent

even touched our detector screen yet im
mighty glad to have seen you fellows
again though anyway

  a couple of hours in his relief
cleveland almost shouted the words
thats time to bum we can be clear
out of the galaxy in less than    
he broke off at a yell from rodebush

  broadcast conway broadcast that
worthy had cried as costigans image had
disappeared utterly from his plate

  now he cut off the boises power
stopping her instantaneously in mid-
space but the connection had been
broken costigan could not possibly have
heard the orders to change his beam
signal to a broadcast so that they could
pick it up nor would it have done any
good if he had heard and had obeyed
so immeasurably great had been their
velocity that they had flashed past the
speedster without seeing it even upon
the ultra-plates and now they were un-
known billions of miles beyond the fugi-
tives they had come so far to help-far
beyond the range of any possible broad-
cast but cleveland had understood in-
stantly what had happened he now had
a little data upon which to work and his
fingers were flying over the keys of the
calculator

  back blast maximum seventeen sec-
onds he directed crisply not exact
of course but thatll put us close enough
to find em with our detectors

  then for the calculated seventeen sec-
onds the super-ship retraced her path
at the same awful speed with which she
had come so far the blast expired and
there plainly limned upon the observa-
tion plates was the nevian speedster

  as a computer youre good rode-
bush applauded so close that we cant
use the neutralizes to catch him if we
use a dyne of driving force well over-
shoot him a million kilometers before i
can snap the switches out

  and yet hes so far away and going so


amazing stories

fast that if we keep our inertia on itll
take all day at full drive to overtake
him cleveland was frankly puzzled
what to do shunt in a potentiometer

  no we dont need it rodebush
turned to the transmitter costigan
we are going to take hold of you with
a very light tractor dont cut it

  a tractor-inertialess  cleveland
wondered

  why not rodebush launched the
tractor set at its absolute minimum of
power and threw in his master switches

  while hundreds of thousands of miles
separating the two vessels and the tractor
beam was exerting the least effort of
which it was capable yet the super-ship
leaped toward the smaller craft at a pace
which covered that distance in the twink-
ling of an eye so rapidly were the ob-
jectives enlarging upon the plates that
the automatic focusing devices could
scarcely function rapidly enough to keep
them in place cleveland flinched invol-
untarily and seized his arm-rests in a
spasmodic clutch as he watched this the
first inertialess space-approach and even
rodebush who knew better than anyone
else what to expect held his breath and
swallowed hard at the unbelievable rate
at which the two vessels were rushing
together

and if these two who had rebuilt
the space-flyer could hardly con-
trol themselves what of the three in the
speedster who knew nothing whatever
of the super-ships potentialities clio
staring into the plate with costigan ut-
tered a piercing shriek as she sank her
fingers into his shoulders bradley swore
a mighty deep-space oath and braced him-
self against certain annihilation costi-
gan stared for an instant unable to be-
lieve his eyes then his hand darted to the
contacts which would cut the beam too
late before his flying fingers could reach

the studs the boise was upon them
had struck them in direct central im-
pact moving at the full measure of her
unthinkable velocity though the super-
ship was at the momentr of impact yet
the most delicate recording instruments
of the speedster could not detect the
slightest shock as the enormous globe
struck the comparatively tiny torpedo and
clung to it accommodating instantly and
effortlessly her own terrific pace to that
of the smaller and infinitely slower craft
clio sobbed in relief and costigan one
arm around her sighed hugely

  hey you space-fleas he cried glad
to see you and all that but you mighi
as well kill a man outright as scare hiir
to death so thats the super-ship huh 
some ship

  hello conway clear ether con-
way the two scientists answered the
hail of their fellow

  i didnt realize that an inertialess ap-
proach would be quite such a terrifying
spectacle or i would have warned you
rodebush went on yes thanks to you
the super-ship works as she should at
last but you had better put on your
suits and transfer you might get your
things ready   

   things is good costigan laughed
and clio giggled sunnily

  weve made so many transfers al-
ready that what you see us in is all we
have bradley explained well bring
ourselves and well hurry that nevian
is coming up fast

  is there anything on this ship you
fellows want costigan asked

  there may be but we havent any
locks big enough to let her inside and
we havent time to study her now you
might leave her controls in neutral so
that lyman can calculate her position if
we should want her later on

  all right the three armor-clad
figures stepped into the boises open
triplanetary



lock the tractor beam was cut off and
the speedster flashed away from the now
stationary super-ship

  better let formalities go for a while
captain bradley interrupted the general
introduction taking place i was scared
out of nine years growth when i saw
you coming at us and maybe ive still
got the humps but that nevian is com-
ing up fast and if you dont already
know it i can tell you that hes no light
cruiser

  thats so too costigan concurred
have you fellows got enough stuff so
that you think you can take him youve
got the legs on him anyway-you can
certainly run if you want to

  run v cleveland laughed we have
a bone of our own to pick with that ship
we licked her to a standstill once until
we burned out a set of generators and
since we got them fixed weve been chas-
ing her all over space we were chas-
ing her when we picked up your call
see there shes doing the running

  the nevian was running in truth her
commander had seen and had recognized
the great vessel which had flashed out
of nowhere to the rescue of the three
terrestrials and having once been at
grips with that vengeful super-dread-
nought he had little stomach for another
encounter therefore his side-thrust was
now being exerted in the opposite direc-
tion he was frankly trying to put as
much distance as possible between him-
self and triplanetarys formidable
cruiser in vain a light tractor was
clamped on and the boise flashed up
to close range before rodebush threw
on her inertia and cleveland brought the
two vessels relatively to rest by increas-
ing gradually his tractors pull and this
time the nevian could not cut the tractor
again that shearing plane of force bit
into it and tore at it but it neither
yielded nor broke the rebuilt generators
of number four were designed to carry

the load and they carried it and again
triplanetarys every mighty weapon was
brought into play

the cans were thrown ultra- and
infra-beams were driven the furi-
ous macro-beam gnawed hungrily at the
nevians defenses and one by one those
defenses went down in desperation the
enemy commander threw his every gen-
erator behind a polycydic screen only
to see clevelands even more powerful
drill bore relentlessly through it punc-
tured that last defense the end came
soon a secondary sx beam was now
in place on mighty tens inner rings and
one fierce blast blew a hole completely
through the nevian cruiser into that
hole entered adlingtons terrific bombs
and their gruesome fellows and where
they entered life departed all defenses
vanished and under the blasts of the
boises projectors now unopposed the
metal of the nevian vessel exploded in-
stantly into a widely spreading cloud of
vapor sparkling vapor with perhaps
here and there a droplet or two of ma-
terial which had only been liquefied

  so passed the sister-ship and rode-
bush turned his plates upon the vessel
of nerado but that highly intelligent
amphibian had seen all that had occurred
he had long since given over the pursuit
of the speedster and he did not rush
in to do hopeless battle beside his fellow
nevians against the terrestrials his
analytical detectors had written down
each detail of every weapon and of every
screen employed and even while prodigi-
ous streamers of red force were raving
out from his vessel braking her terrific
progress and swinging her around in an
immense circle back toward far nevia
his scientists and mechanics were dou-
bling and redoubling the power of his
already titanic installations to match
and if possible to overmatch those of
triplanetarys super-dreadnought


amazing stories

  do we kill him now or do we let
him suffer a while longer costigan
demanded

  i dont think so yet replied rode-
bush would you lyman

not yet replied cleveland grimly
reading the thought of the other
and agreeing with it let him pilot us to
nevia we might not be able to find it
without a guide while were at it we
want to so pulverize that crowd that if
they never come near the solarian sys-
tem again theyll think its twenty minutes
too soon

  thus it was that the boise under
only a few dynes of propulsion pursued
the nevian ship apparently exerting
every effort she never came quite within
range of the fleeing raider yet never
was she so far behind that the nevian
space-ship was not in clear register upon
her observation plates nor was nerado
alone in strengthening his vessel costi-
gan knew well and respected highly the
nevian scientist-captain and at his sug-
gestion the entire time of the long and
uneventful flight was spent in reenforc-
ing the super-ships armament to the
iron-driven limit of theoretical and me-
chanical possibility

  thus when nevia and her hot blue
sun appeared upon his plates rodebush
was ready for any emergency and hurled
his battleship upon the nevian with every
weapon aflame but so was nerado
ready and unlike her sister-ship his
vessel was manned by scientists well
versed in the fundamental theory of the
weapons with which they fought beams
rods and lances of energy flamed and
flared planes and pencils cut slashed
and stabbed defensive screens glowed
redly or flashed suddenly into intensely
brilliant coruscating incandescence crim-
son opacity struggled sullenly against
violet curtain of annihilation material
projectiles and torpedoes were launched

under full beam control only to be ex-
ploded harmlessly in mid-space to be
rayed into nothingness or to disappear
innocuously against impenetrable poly-
cyclic screens both vessels were equipped
completely with iron-driven mechanisms
both were manned by scientists capable
of wringing the last possible watt of
power from their sources they were ap-
proximately equal in size and each now
wielded the theoretical ultimate of power
for her mass therefore neither could
harm the other furiously though each was
trying and more and more nearly they
were approaching the red atmosphere of
the world of the amphibians down into
that crimson blanket the two warring
space-ships dropped down toward a city
which costigan recognized as that in
which nerado made his headquarters

  better hold off a bit costigan cau-
tioned if i know that bird at all hes
cooking up something and even as he
spoke there shot upward from the city
a multitude of flashing balls the nev-
ians had mastered the secret of the ex-
plosive of the fishes of the greater deeps
and were launching it in a veritable storm
against the terrestrial visitor

  those asked rodebush calmly
the detonating balls of destruction were
literally annihilating even the atmosphere
beyond the polycyclic screen but that
barrier was scarcely affected

  no that pointing out a hemispher-
ical dome which redly translucent sur-
rounded a group of buildings towering
high above their neighbors neither
those high towers nor those screens were
there the last time i was in this town
theyre stalling for time down there
thats all those fireballs are for good
sign too-maybe they arent ready for
us yet if not youd better take em
while the takings good and if they are
ready for us wed better get out of here
while were all in one piece
triplanetary



amd in fact nerado had been in touch
with the scientists of his city had
been instructing them in the construc-
tion of converters and generators of
such weight and power that they could
crush even the defenses of the super-
ship they were not however quite
done the entirely unsuspected possibil-
ities of speed inherent in absolute in-
ertialessness had not entered into ne-
rados calculations

  better drop a few cans down on that
dome fellows before they make trouble
for us suggested rodebush to his
gunners

  we cant came adlingtons instant
reply weve been trying it but thats
a polycvclic screen can you drill it
if you can ive got a real bomb here-
that special we built-that will do the
trick if you can protect it from their
beams until it gets down into the water

  ill try it cleveland answered at
a nod from the physicist i couldnt
drill nerados polycyclics but i couldnt
use any momentum on him couldnt
ram him-he fell back with my thrust
but that screen down there cant back
off so maybe i can work on it get
your special ready and hang on every-
body r

  the boise looped upward and from
an altitude of miles dove downward
through a storm of force-balls rays and
shells a dive checked abruptly as the
hollow tube of energy which was cleve-
lands drill snarled savagely down ahead
of her and struck the shielding hemis-
phere with a grinding lightning-splitting
shock as it struck backed by all the
enormous momentum of the plunging
space-ship and driven by the full power
of her mightiest generators it bored in
clawing and gouging viciously through
the tissue of that rigid and unyielding
barrier of pure energy then mighty
drill and plunging mass against iron-
driven wall eye-tearing and furiously

spectacular warfare was waged well
it was for triplanetary that day that its
super ship carried ample supply of al-
lotropic iron well it was that her orig-
inally gargantuan converters and gen-
erators had been doubled and quadrupled
in power on the long nevian way for
that oven-girdled fortress was powered
to withstand any conceivable assault
but the boises power and momentum
were now inconceivable and every watt
and every dyne was solidly behind that
hellishly flaming that voraciously tear-
ing that irresistibly ravening cylinder
of energy incredible

  through the nevian shield that cylin-
der gnawed its frightful way and down
its protecting length there drove adling-
tons special bomb special it
was indeed so great of girth that it
could barely pass through the central
orifice of tens mighty projector so
heavily charged with sensitized atomic
iron that its detonation upon any planet
would not have been considered for an
instant if that planets integrity meant
anything to its attackers down the
shielding pipe of force the special
screamed under full propulsion and be-
neath the surface of nevias ocean it
plunged

  cut yelled adlington and as the
scintillating drill expired the bomber
snapped his detonating switch

fr a moment the effect of the ex-
plosion seemed unimportant a dull
low rumble was all that was to be heard
of a concussion that jarred red nevia to
her very center and all that could be
seen was a slow heaving of the water
but that heaving did not cease slow-
ly so slowly it seemed to the observ-
ers now high in the heavens the waters
rose up and parted revealing a vast
chasm blown deep into the oceans rocky
bed higher and higher the lazy moun-
tains of water reared effortlessly to


amazing stories

pick up to smash to grind into frag-
ments and finally to toss aside every
building ever structure every scrap
of material substance pertaining to the
whole nevian city

  flattened out driven backward for
miles the tortured waters were urged
leaving exposed bare ground and broken
rock where once had been the oceans
busy floor while tremendous blasts of
incandescent gas raved upward buffet-
ing even the enormous masses of the two
space-ships poised by their breathless
crews so high above the site of the ex-
plosion then the displaced millions of
tons of water rushed back into that
newly rived pit seeming to seek in that
mad rush to make even more complete
the already total destruction of the city
the raging torrents poured into that
yawning cavern filled it and piled
mountainously above it receding and
piling up again and again causing tidal
waves which swept a full half of nevias
mighty watery globe

the city forever silenced rodebush
again directed his weapons upon
nerados vessel but the nevian wras no
longer fighting for the first time in
that long and bitter engagement not a
nevian beam was in operation his
screens however were as capable as
ever and after a few fruitless attempts
to make an impression upon them rode-
bush cut off his own offensive and
turned to costigan

 what do you make of it conway
you know these people better than we
do what are they up to

  i wish to talk to you nerados
voice came from the speaker and i
could not do so while the beams were
operating you are i now perceive a
much higher form of life than any of
us had thought possible a form per-
haps as high in evolution as our own
it is a pity that we did not meet you

when we first neared your planet so
that much life both tellurian and
nevian might have been spared but
what is past cannot be recalled as
reasoning beings however you will see
the futility of continuing a combat in
which neither of us is capable of injur-
ing the other you may of course de-
stroy more of our nevian cities in
which case i should be compelled to go
and destroy similarly upon your earth
but to reasoning minds such a course
of procedure is sheerest folly

rodebush cut the communicator beam

does he mean it he demanded of
costaigan it sounds reasonable but

        

  but fishy broke in cleveland al-
together too reasonable for a   

  yes he means it every word of
it interrupted costigan in turn thats
the way they are reasonable passion-
less funny-they lack a lot of things
we have but theyve got a lot of things
that i wish more of us tellurians had
too give me the plate-ill talk for
triplanetary and the beam was re-
stored

  captain nerado he greeted the
nevian commander having been with
you and among your people i know that
you mean what you say and that you
speak for your race similarly i be-
lieve that i can speak for the triplane-
tary council-the government of three
of the planets of our solar system-in
saying that there need be no more con-
flict between our peoples i also was
compelled by circumstances to do cer-
tain things which i now wish could be
undone but as you have said the past
is past our two races have much to
gain from each other by friendly ex-
changes of materials and of ideas while
we can expect nothing except mutual ex-
termination if we elect to continue this
warfare i offer you the friendship of
triplanetary will you release your
triplanetary



screens and come aboard to sign a
treaty

  i will come my screens are down
rodebush likewise cut off his power
although somewhat apprehensively and
a nevian lifeboat entered the main air-
lock of the boise

then at a table in the control room
of triplanetarys first super-ship
there was written the first inter-systemic
treaty upon one side the three ne-
vians  amphibious cone-headed loop-
necked scale-bodies four-legged things to
us monstrosities upon the other the three
humans air-breathing rounded-headed
shortnecked smooth-bodied two-legged
creatures equally monstrous to the fastid-
ious nevians yet each of these rep-
resentatives of two races so different
felt respect for the other race increase
within him minute by minute as the
convetsation went on

  the nevians had destroyed pitts-
burgh but adlingtons bomb had blown
an equally populous nevian city out of
existence one nevian vessel had wiped
out an entire unit of triplanetarys fleet
but costigan practically unaided had
depopulated one nevian city and had
seriously damaged another he had also
beamed down many nevian ships
therefore loss of life and material could

be balanced the solarian system was
rich in iron to which the nevians were
welcome red nevia possessed abun-
dant stores of substances which upon
earth were extremely rare and of vital
importance therefore commerce was to
be encouraged the nevians had knowl-
edges and skills unknown to earthly
science but were entirely ignorant of
many things to us commonplace there-
fore interchange of students and of
books was highly desirable and so on

  thus was signed the triplanetario-
nevian treaty of eternal peace ne-
rado and his two companions were es-
corted ceremoniously to their vessel and
the boise took off in an inertialess
dash toward earth bearing the good
news that the nevian menace was no
more	

  clio now a hardened space-flea im-
mune even to the horrible nausea of in-
ertialessness wriggled lithely in the
curve of costigans arm and laughed up
at him

  you can talk all you want to con-
way but i dont like them a bit they
give me the purple jitters i suppose
that they are really estimable folks tal-
ented cultured and everything but just
the same ill bet that it will be a long
long time before anybody on earth will

       really truly like them

impressive story of a lost people
a new serial commencing in the may issue
  the hcentankah

by francis flagg

the name of this story gives a clue to its topic it really seems to suggest a
name for a new party and possibly with all the intellect now being lavished
on the government it might be adopted for immediate use it is certainly
most suggestive in substituting for the physical basis of mechanics the
spiritual basis of mind the readers will find in it a new development of
the most suggestive kind presented in a most amusing way

illustrated by morey

this is a strange story and
if you are the kind of person
who believes nothing without
overwhelming proof read no
further for the story is an
incredible one and centers around char-
acters widely divergent as to back-
ground and walks of life-bronson
smith and stringer

  bronson was by way of being an ad-
venturous man one who had sailed the
seven seas first as focasle hand then
as mate and skipper of rusty tramps for
chinese owners in the orient yet he
was by no means uneducated though the
knowledge he possessed on a wide range
of subjects seldom met with in the rep-
ertoire of that type of tramp captains
had been gleaned from books and not
from colleges olson smith had picked
him up-i never rightly understood when
or how-in the indian ocean and made
him captain of his sleek ocean liner mas-
querading as a yacht olson smith
could afford the luxury of thousand ton
yachts because his father had been canny
enough to get into a packing-house com-
bine at the right moment and so turn
an already sizable fortune into millions
olson himself however had nothing to
do with the packing business aside from
helping to spend its profits he was

a dilettante of sorts a patron of the
arts a stout distinguished looking gen-
tleman under sixty who endowed col-
leges and founded chairs and laboratories
for research work through these be
nevolences he became acquainted with
professor stringer the physicist whose
remarkable achievements in his chosen
field which also covered mathematics
had won him an international reputa-
tion professor stringer was not a pop-
ular scientist his abstruse and remark-
able paper on the electronic flow and
its relation with time being practi-
cally unknown to the general public
but among his colleagues he was regarded
with great respect for his actual dis-
coveries in the realm of physics and
even though many of them looked
askance at the radical theories advanced
in his paper portions of the paper itself
were received as a genuine if somewhat
abstract contribution to knowledge

  olson smith read the paper how
much of it he understood is a moot ques-
tion as the secretary of his benefac-
tions i was instrumental in bringing it
to his attention here i said is a
chance to do something for pure science
he was not at first inclined to be in-
terested the thing he said is moon-
shine pure moonshine




      for heavens sake man the professor tried to reach his side
      careful you fool careful dont touch anything


amazing stories

  perhaps so i replied but you
must remember that the moonshine often
precedes the practical science con-
sider sir   he considered and
after due reflection loosened the purse-
strings

rofessor stringer graciously al-
lowed himself to be endowed he
was one sensed fed up with wasting
his genius on unappreciative college stu-
dents  and he wanted money much
money a million dollars he said to carry
out his experiments but he made it
clear that he was honoring olson smith
by allowing him to donate the money
and strangely enough-for olson smith
was a plutocrat convinced of his own
weight and importance-the magnate
agreed the personality of professor
stringer-and this dried-up wizened little
scientist in the middle fifties possessed
a dynamic personality-carried all before
it olson smith turned over to him his
long island home built workshops and
laboratories and then left him to the
seclusion and privacy he desired taking
his annual trip to the bermudas what
with one thing and another we did not
see professor stringer again until a
year later when the yacht tied up at the
private pier of the long island estate
and we dined with him besides olson
smith professor stringer and myself
three others were present that night a
middle-aged business man named glea-
son ruddy of face from constant sham-
pooing and good living a noted sur-
geon who does not wish his name or
description given here and captain
bronson of the steam-yacht perhaps i
have failed to mention that captain bron-
son was a remarkably handsome man
somewhere under forty whose medium
height and slender figure belied the great
physical strength that was really his
he certainly did not look the two-fisted
fighter the dubious hero of shady ex-

ploits that olson smith declared him
to be the multimillionaire was scarcely
one to make friends of his hired men
be they valets or private secretaries but
between himself and bronson an un-
doubted intimacy existed based per-
haps on the dual nature of the captain
bronson was capable either of fighting
or of discussing the merits of a pulitzer
prize winner a sort of wolf larsen of
a fellow but more versatile and amen-
able than jack londons character

  there was drink that night of course
wines liqueurs and a very good brandy
all brought from the boat but the pro-
fessor touched nothing a scientist
must have a clear head he said and
alcohol is not conducive to that-no-
but he drank coffee and when the ser-
vants had served it and left us alone
he began to talk almost musingly
time he said is the great enigma
the phenomenon that captivates the im-
agination we travel in it from the
cradle to the grave and yet he said
what do we know of time nothing
he said nothing save that it is related
to space he paused and looked at
us all half-dreamily as you know i
have discovered a force that i call the
electronic row and that force i have
related to the phenomenon of time i
am convinced-in my various papers on
the subject i have sought to show-
that the electronic flow being to all
intents and purposes the absolute as far
as we are concerned is capable of bear-
ing us on its bosom into the future or
rather its tremendous speed is capable
of holding us suspended at the core of
things while the phenomenon of time

   he broke off and regarded us
more directly really he said i dont
know as i am making this subject very
clear but you must understand he
said that there are points on which i
am not very clear myself whether the
speed of the electronic flow carries one
the mentanicals



forward into time or the speed of time
passes one held in the electronic flow is
a question difficult to answer yes
he said very difficult to determine of
course i did not start my recent investi-
gations with any intention so radical as
building a time machine not at first
he said my intentions were merely to
verify mathematically some further theo-
ries and to demonstrate  he mused
a moment but do you know the idea
of an actual time machine grew on
me it were he said as if something
whispered in my very brain and drove
me on i cant describe it foolishness
of course but i built the time ma-
chine he looked at olson smith
yes he said i built the time ma-
chine it lies in the laboratory yonder
and to-night-to-night he said i am
going to demonstrate it for the first
time

the business man was one of those
beefy individuals who stare into
whiskey glasses and make strange noises
in their throats when they fail to under-
stand anything stuff and nonsense
he said now stuff and nonsense

  bronson stared at him oh i dont
know

  but to travel in time

  it does sound absurd

  absurd said the famous doctor

  and yet you know what they said
about iron steamships sinking and heav-
ier-than-air flying machines

  that was different

  different i said with conviction

       in my time said olson smith
building time machines he looked
reproachfully at his glass will some
one he asked pass the brandy

  the brandy was passed

  we were all drinking more than was
good for us perhaps the professor
put down his coffee cup and addressed
himself to olson smith in a sense

he said a financial sense this time ma-
chine is yours if you care to see it
demonstrated   he stood up

  the business man did not stir he
muttered something about damn-fool
nuts and snorted into his glass but
the rest of us were interested a fresh
breeze was blowing off the water as
we passed from the house to the labora-
tory and helped partially to dissipate
the fumes of alcohol professor string-
er threw open the laboratory door and
turned on the lights we saw it then
an odd machine shiny and rounded oc-
cupying the center of the workshop floor
i had been drinking you will recollect
and my powers o observation were not
at their best it was the same with
the others when i questioned them
later they could give no adequate de-
scription of it so this said olson
smith rather flatly is a time machine
the doctor walked about-a little un-
steadily i noticed-and viewed it from
all angles the passenger said the
professor sits here notice this lever
on the graduated face of the dial it
controls the machine turn it this way
from zero and one travels into the past 
throw it ahead and one travels into the
future the return of the lever to zero
will return the machine to the point
of departure in time the electronic
flow    he went into obscure details
will it work demanded the doctor
according to the equation 
equations

  it cannot help but function

if time travelling were possible
bronson laughed loudly to travel
in time that would be an adventure
on paper jibbed the doctor
bronson laughed again well see
about that

all of us were a little drunk i tell
you and despite the respect we
felt for professor stringer as an emin-


amazing stories

ent scientist no one believed in his time
machine i am quite certain that bron-
son didnt or did he i have sketched
his background and there is little doubt
that by temperament and training he
was a wild and reckless fellow one given
to doing bizarre things and taking des-
perate chances with a quick movement
that no one anticipated he stepped for-
ward and seated himself in the passenger
seat of the odd contrivance i can see
him yet his face flushed his eyes bril-
liant his mop of dark hair disordered
all aboard for the future he shouted
recklessly

  for heavens sake man the pro-
fessor tried to reach his side careful
you fool careful dont touch any-
thing but bronson grasped the lever
and pushed it pushed it abruptly ahead
how can i describe what followed
there was a chaotic moment when the
machine spun-we saw it spinning a
blurred mass a sudden wind rushed
through the room in quick fury raged
subsided and left us staring in dumb
amazement and fear at an empty spot
the machine-and bronson with it-
had vanished before our eyes

  that was on june the first a little
before midnight and five days passed
five days during which bronson was
lost to his own time and place

  ahead of us in time that was the
implication

  close to the machine when bronson
turned the lever professor stringer had
been thrown to the floor his head struck
bv a portion of the machine as it
whirled into invisibility we picked him
up unconscious and for days he hov-
ered on the verge of death the next
morning the business man went his way
to the city ignorant of what had oc-
curred time machines he chortled
time machines and smiled fatly but
the rest of us settled down to wait for
we knew not what and on the fifth day

occurred the terrific explosion by the
old stone wall a half mile from the
workshop and when we hurried there
it was to find bronson entangled in a
wreckage of steel and other metals we
hauled him forth his clothes were in
shreds his body terribly bruised and
battered and it was some time before
he could be made to realize where he
was brandy he exclaimed for
gods sake give me brandy we gave
him brandy and other things and the
doctor patched him up and we rushed
him to a hospital where in time he re-
covered from the shock and his broken
bones knit but the beauty that had
been his was forever marred by a
livid scar diagonally crossing the nose
and running to the bulge of the jaw-
bone he fingered it as he told us of
his incredible adventure

bronsons story

time he said is the great phe-
nomenon i know that but to
travel in it-ah that seemed im-
possible to the point of absurdity i
had read h g wells the time ma-
chine as who has not deeming it fan-
tastic fiction wells story is fantastic
fiction of course though scarcely as fan-
tastic as what i experienced

  when i seated myself in the pro-
fessors time machine that night and
pushed over the lever i have no need
to tell you that i was in a drunken and
reckless mood the room turned around
me like a pin-wheel dissolved into mist
i was conscious of the terrible vibration
of the machine of a deathly sickness at
the pit of my stomach blackness fol-
lowed the mist wells describes what
the character in his story saw as he
journeyed into the future the procession
of days and nights ever accelerating their
motion but i saw nothing like that per-
the mentanicals



haps from the beginning the speed was
too great terrified bewildered i yet
retained enough presence of mind to de-
press the lever into neutral and so bring
the machine to a halt moments passed
while i lolled in my seat blind dazed
then my vision cleared-and i could see
it was day sunlight fell around me
everything was strange-and different
how can i make you see what i saw
the machine stood near one end of a
great open square that was surrounded
by massive buildings those buildings
i had never seen their like before and
yet there was a similarity of line of
mathematical precision which linked them
with the architecture of new york and
chicago it was as if the building con-
struction of to-day had been carried
to an extreme length as if the ma-
chine had carried it forzuard i did not
think that at the moment but later   

  the walls of the massive buildings
were broken by yawning doorways so
this i thought is the future it can be
nothing less than that i stepped out of
the machine holding on to it for sup-
port still feeling terribly sick and giddy
then i saw the cylinders they came
gliding from one of the openings in
an upright fashion and this was the
singular thing about them that their
means of locomotion were not apparent
to the eye there were no wheels or
treads they appeared to skim the stone
or concrete with which the square was
paved rather than touch it oddly re-
pellant they were and intimidating and
i loosened the automatic in its shoulder
holster-the small one i always carry-
and prepared for emergencies though
bullets were useless against the cylinders
as i was to discover later

the cylinders were smooth things
about five feet tall of a dulled metal
hue with here and there shining spots
which constantly waxed and waned in

color they were machines-i thought
of them as machines-and it was rea-
sonable to suppose that behind them
lurked a human intelligence the people
of the future i thought have invented
devices unknown to us of the twentieth
century and it came over me how won-
derful it was going to be to meet those
superior people talk to them gaze upon
the marvels with which they had sur-
rounded themselves

  so i went to meet the cylinders

  their soft whispering meant noth-
ing to me at first nor at first did i
suspect the source of the gentle pres-
sure running over me from head to
foot as the cylinders came close then
with an odd thrill of apprehension i
realized that the curious cylinders were
handling examining me that from them
emanated an electrical force a manipu-
lation of invisible rays which functioned
as organs of touch alone bewildered
trying vainly to comprehend the strange
situation i had to call on every ounce
of my self-control to remain calm yes
i was afraid-only the fool says he
never is-but more afraid of being
afraid of showing fear i still believed
that behind those cylinders must lurk a
human intelligence the genius of the
race seemed to run along the line of
making robots there was the metal
brain at washington that told of the
tides the electrical eye which watched
a thousand industrial processes a myriad
automatic devices functioning with little
or no supervision from man and of
course i had read the play r u r
science fiction stories dealing with the
future of machinery and it was inevi-
table-strange and yet not so strange-
that i should expect an advancement
a realization of all those things in the
future man the inventor i thought
had achieved them and for a moment
this belief seemed borne out when i
saw the men


amazing stories

  they were in one of the buildings
and the city of buildings which i was
soon to know lay on all sides of and
beyond the square i did not struggle
when the cylinders lifted and carried me
away that is i ceased my involuntary
resistance almost at once it was use-
less to struggle against a force far su-
perior to my own puny strength be-
sides i believed the robots were carry-
ing me to their human masters

  the building into which i was taken
-through an arched opening-was a
vast place too vast too overwhelming
for me to describe save in the vaguest
most general terms you know how it
is when you see something stupendous
something so intricate that you are be-
wildered by its very complexity there
was a huge room filled with almost noise-
less machines rooted in their places like
shackled monsters or going to and fro
on cables and grooves which determined
their spheres of activity strange lights
glowed weird devices toiled but i can
tell you no more than that i saw them
for too short a time

  the men were among those machines
at sight of them my heart leapt here
i thought is the human intelligence back
of the wonders i view the masters of
the cylindrical robots yet even at that
moment i was aware of a doubt a mis-
giving

  one of the men shambled forward
his blond hair-long and matted-fell
oier the forehead and he brushed it
back with a taloned hand and stared at
me stupidly hello i said what
place is this what year tell these
robots of yours to let me go

  he was naked and thin his skin of
a greenish pallor and save for a mouth-
ing of toothless gums vouchsafed me
no answer chilled by his lack of re-
sponse my heart fell as suddenly as it
had leapt good god i thought this
cant be master here this pitiful thing

the cylinders seemed watching atten-
tively listening i dont know how but
they gave me that impression and now
i noticed that the shining spots on them
were glowing intensely that their whis-
pering was not a steady but a modulated
sound as if it were language i thought
language and a strange dread came over
me and i shivered as if with cold other
men perhaps a dozen in number came
forward naked and shambling with
stupid beast-like looks on their faces
and rumblings in their throats in vain
i endeavored to communicate with them
human intelligence seemed dead back of
their lack-luster eyes filled with rising
horror i squirmed in the grip of the
cylinders and suddenly their hold on me
relaxed and i tore myself free and
fled possessed with but one overwhelm-
ing desire and that was to win to the
time machine leave this uncanny future
and return to my own day and age but
the arched opening leading to the square
had vanished blank wall rose where it
had been the cylinders appeared to
watch me with cold impersonal watchful-
ness the thought of being marooned
among them in this incredible and alien
future brought the chill sweat to my
forehead but i did not lose my head
perhaps the closing of the doorway had
not been a calculated thing perhaps if
i awaited events with caution and pa-
tience the door would re-open meantime
i could search for other exits

but other exits did not give on the
square i desired i discovered but
two of them anyway though there may
have been many more one leading into
a dark forbidding tunnel the other giv-
ing access to a second square entirely
surrounded by buildings i was afraid
to venture into other buildings for fear
of going astray of losing the neighbor-
hood of the time machine filled with
what feelings you can imagine i re-
the mejntanicals



turned to the first doorway through
which i had been carried to find it still
closed then i thought of the beast-
like men perhaps they possessed knowl-
edge that might be helpful to me per-
haps after all i could succeed in com-
municating with them it was hazardous
work penetrating any distance in that
maze of almost noiseless and ever-toiling
mechanisms but i followed in the foot-
steps of the timidly retreating beast-
men and so at last came to a kind of
squatting place in the midst of the ma-
chinery which locality appeared to be
their place of abode since a number of
women with children cowered there and
the men showed a disposition to pause
and dispute my further progress at
the edge of the squatting place i seated
myself my automatic ready for ac-
tion and lit a cigarette i know of noth-
ing that soothes the nerves like nico-
tine slowly the beast-men drew near
me i smiled and made peaceful ges-
tures some half-grown children crept
closer and fingered my clothes they
were eating i noticed a kind of biscuit
which they took at will from a scuttle-
like machine and chewing small pellets
water ran through a huge metal trough
with a subdued roar after awhile i
got up and went to the trough to satisfy
a growing thirst helping myself at the
same time to biscuits from the scuttle
they were rather flat in flavor-lacking
salt perhaps-and possessed a peculiar
taste i did not like the pellets were
better they too were obtained from a
scuttle-machine i can call them nothing
else and were pleasant to chew i
soon discovered that swallowed at regular
intervals one of them gave all the sen-
sations of having partaken of a hearty
meal i had eaten an hour-or was it
twenty centuries-before but ate again
feeling ravenously hungry probably
the pellets represented a dehydrated
method of concentrating foods far in

advance of that utilized in the prepara-
tion of certain foodstuffs today be
that as it may i filled my pockets with
them and i dare say if you were to
search the clothes i returned in you
will find some of those pellets

i spent several hours at the squat-
ting place of the beast-men trying to
talk to them but without success seem-
ingly they were as are the animals of
the field lacking coherent language men
who had somehow lost the power to
talk to think the ability to grasp the
meaning of simple signs such as pos-
sessed by the lowliest aborigine to-day in
vain i speculated as to the reason for
this that the cylinders were somehow
responsible i felt certain man i
thought had developed the robot the
automatic machine until the human
worker was ejected from the industrial
process and cast out to degenerate and
perish the beast-men being a surviving
remnant of those toilers this reason-
ing seemed plausible enough at the time
though it left much to be desired for in
the twentieth century from which i had
come wasnt the machine replacing hu-
man workers with a ruthlessness sug-
gestive of what i found in the future
how right i was in my reasoning and
how wrong you will shortly see

  thinking thus it was natural that i
should again turn my attention to the
cylinders never once had i been free
from their observation or unconscious
of it through them i thought i shall
contact the rulers of this realm the
human masters whose servants they are
the pitiless ones who have doomed a
portion of humanity to beast-hood and
extinction so i grimly waited-a prey
to what emotions you can imagine-
observing the beast-men watching the
blank wall for the possible opening of
the way to the square and the time ma-
chine and all the time aware of the


amazing stories

coming and going of those cylinders
time passed how much of it i had no
means of telling since my wrist-watch
refused to run but a long time and
finally i grew tired of waiting for the
cylindrical robots to communicate my
presence to their masters or to conduct
me there and decided to seek their
presence myself

  by way of the opening already al-
luded to i gained access to the second
square the squares were a peculiar
feature of the place as i was soon to
learn there were no streets or roads
leading from square to square the
squares were isolated with radiating ar-
teries always ending against some build-
ing-at least those did that i explored

  dusk was falling as i entered the
square indescribably lonely it was
lonely and weird to look up and see the
stars blazing far overhead i followed
one radiating artery to a blank wall
another another then suddenly i was
too tired to proceed further and re-
turned to the vicinity of the closed door
where i lay down at the base of the
blank wall and fell asleep

  the next morning i filled my pockets
with pellets and again started out
square after square i passed through
and building after building the cyl-
inders were everywhere but did not in-
terfere with my movements a group of
them constantly accompanied me but
whether always composed of the same
cylinders i could not tell their inces-
sant whispering was a nerve-wracking
thing and i often felt like turning on
them and shooting

i wish i could tell you all i saw
buildings full of toiling machinery
and now and then a score or so of beast-
men squares and radiating arteries
without a blade of grass or a tree and
never an animal a bird or an insect
on that first day of exploration despite

every precaution i lost my way-hope-
lessly-and spent futile hours trying to
retrace my steps i have been lost in
tropical jungles there was that time
in siam but never before had i felt
so panic-stricken remember i was an
alien creature in an incredible future
separated from the only means of re-
turning to my own place and time one
square was like another one building
similar to its neighbor soon i gave
up the vain effort to return to my start-
ing point my sole hope now lay in
finding the rulers of this bewildering
maze

  that night-i knew it was night when
darkness fell in the squares-i slaked my
thirst with a trickle of water running
from a pipe swallowed a pellet and
almost instantly sank into the sleep of
exhaustion

  the next day i came to a part of the
city free of the beast-men the squares
were larger the radiating arteries were
spendid roads but in the midst of many
squares stood circular buildings not met
with before i entered one of them and
was surprised to find huge rooms filled
with pieces of rusted tools shovels
spades chisels hammers axe-heads all
displayed in a kind of chronological or-
der the thought of its being a museum
did not occur to me at once it was only
after a while that i exclaimed to my-
self why this looks like a museum
then the inevitable conviction came it
is a museum but who could have ar-
ranged it certainly not the witless
beast-men and of other men i had seen
nothing this failure to find human be-
ings on a par with the stupendous build-
ings and machines all around filled me
with anxious forboding i gazed at the
cylinders for the first time it came
over me that they were the only uni-
versal inhabitants i had seen bewild-
ered amazed i wandered from building
to building and from floor to floor for
the mentanicals



some of the buildings had as many as
a dozen floors accessible to myself
gained not by stairways but by gradu-
ally mounting run-ways or ramps in cir-
cular wells engrossed in what i saw
forgetting for the nonce my terrible
plight

  there were chambers filled with frag-
ments of machines such as cash-registers
clock-wheels gasoline engines and simi-
lar devices nothing was complete near-
ly everything showed the wear and
tear of time and there were others
containing various machines more or less
correctly reassembled from ancient parts 
automobiles for instance and locomo-
tives with an arrangement of simpler
mechanical forms leading to more com-
plex ones i couldnt comprehend why
all those things had been gathered to-
gether for preservation and display nor
account for the age of them their gen-
eral condition of ruin

  not on that day nor on the next-
it was on the last day that i spent in
the strange future-did i come to the
library and here i must touch on an-
other phase of my adventure you can
have no idea how horrible it became
at times to be alone among hundreds
yes thousands of whispering cylinders
i was always aware of their subtle and
invisible touch have you ever felt
the antennae of an insect like that it
was like that i recall one time on the
gold coast    only it bolstered up
my tottering sanity and control to gaze
now and then on creatures similar in
structure to myself even if they were
but the soulless beast-men of the ma-
chines for in all that vast and intricate
city they were the only human beings
i could discover and i began to suspect
to dread i scarcely knew what

i came to the library i say on that
last day i did not know it was a
library at first-and perhaps i was mis-

taken in believing the odd metal disks
arranged in piles on shelves and tables
and consulted by the cylinders to be a
species of recording plates-but it was
here i found the books they were in
boxes of thin metal the better evidently
to protect them from injury

  the thrill of seeing those books old
they were old covers gone pages tom
and missing but they were books and
magazines though few in number and
i examined them eagerly all this time 
the cylinders were following me watch-
ing me as if weighing my actions and
all the time i fought back a feeling of
weirdness uncanniness unnerving it
was intimidating i had the feeling that
in some perfectly incomprehensible way
my actions were being controlled di-
rected experimenting i thought thats
what theyre doing experimenting with
me but you mustnt get the idea that
i realized or suspected this at first even
up to that moment i was still thinking
of the cylinders as automatic devices
without intelligence or reason and it
must be kept in mind that if i speak of
them from time to time as if understand-
ing their true nature from the begin-
ning i am speaking as one who looks
back upon past happenings from the
vantage-point of later knowledge

  the books and magazines were typed
in english i was amazed of course
seeing english print at such a time and
place the whispering of the cylin-
ders rose louder and louder as i ex-
amined a book the title page was gone
it dealt with a dry subject-physics evi-
dently-which interested me little i
turned from the books to the magazines
one was dated  nineteen-sixty
march of that year and the place of
publication was given as new york i
could not help but marvel at this for
 was still twenty-six years in the
future when i left that night on the
time machine and to judge by the yel-


amazing stories

lowing pages of the magazine it was old
old it was difficult to decipher the
print many of the pages being torn and
defaced but a portion of an article i
was able to read in  stated the
unknown writer the first mechanical
brain-cell was invented with its use a
machine was able to learn by experience
to find its way through a maze to-day
we have machines with a dozen mechan-
ical brain-cells functioning in every com-
munity what is this miracle taking
place under our eyes what of good and
of ill does it bode to its creators

marveling much i turned to

another magazine in much the
same condition but this time lacking date
or title page where i gleaned the fol-
lowing 

  man is not a machine in the purely
mechanical sense though many of his
functions are demonstrably mechanical
the ability to reason however it has
evolved whatever it may be at bottom
whether a bewildering complexity of re-
flex actions or not lifts man above the
dignity of-a machine does this imply
the impossibility of creating machines
mechanical brains that can profit by
experience go through the processes
which we call thought no but it does
imply that such machines however cre-
ated are no longer mere mechanisms
there is here a dialectical process to be
reckoned with machines that learn
are living machines

  living machines i mouthed that
phrase over and over to myself-and
mouthing it i looked at the cylinders
with increasing dread they were ma-
chines were they    could they   
but it took the story in the third maga-
zine which like the others was woefully
delapidated with many pages and pieces
of pages missing to clarify my thought
story-i call it that-based on fantasy
perhaps and a little substratum of fact

so i thought at first i have a good
memory but of course i do not claim
that everything i repeat is given exactly
as i read it the story article was
titled the debacle and the authors
name given as mayne jackson i re-
peat with what fidelity i can

  little did the people of the latter half
of the twentieth century realize the men-
ace to humanity that resided in the con-
tinuous development of aiitomatic ma-
chinery there was that curious book
of samuel butlers erehwon which
provoked comment but was not taken
seriously over a period of years the
robot marched into action as a mechan-
ical curiosity it was not until the genius
of bane borgson-and of a host of
lesser known scientists-furnished the
machine with brain-cells and so made it
conscious of itself as all thinking things
must become that the mentanicals as
they were called began to organize and
revolt man-or rather a section of
mankind a ruling and owning class-had
furthered his immediate interests and
ultimate doom by placing mentanicals in
every sphere of industrial and transpor-
tation activity seemingly in need of
neither rest nor recreation they became
ideal and cheap workers and servants
replacing millions of human toilers re-
ducing them to idleness and beggary
the plea of many thinkers that the ma-
chines be socialized for the benefit of
all that the control of them be collec-
tive and not individual that is anar-
chic went unheeded more and more
the masters of economic life called for
further specialization in the brain-cells
of the mentanicals mentanical armies
marched against rebellious workers and
countries and subdued them with fear-
ful slaughter

  but the revolt of the mentanicals
themselves was so subtle so insidious
so under the circumstance inevitable
that for years it went unnoticed
the mentanicals



rpverything had been surrend-

  ered into their power-or practi-
cally everything factories means of
communication raising of food supplies
policing of cities-everything when the
stupid ruling class at last awoke to a
knowledge of its danger it was to late
to act-mankind lay helpless before the
monster it had created

  the first warning vouchsafed to men
was the whispering of the mentanicals
heretofore they had been silent save for
the slight almost inaudible purr of func-
tioning machinery within them but now
they whispered among themselves-
whispered as if they were talking

  it was an uncanny phenomenon i
remembered the uneasiness with which
i heard it and when i saw several of
them house-servants of mine whisper-
ing together i was filled with alarm
come i said sharply stop loitering
get your work done they stared at
me that is a funny thing to say of
metal cylinders never before had i
inquired very closely into their construc-
tion but now it came over me with
a shock that they must possess organs
of sight-some method of cognizing their
environment-akin to that of vision in
man

  it was at about this time that bane
borgson-the creator of the multiple
mechanical-cell which had made the su-
per-mentanical possible-wrote an ar-
ticle in science and mechanics which
riveted the attention of all thoughtful
people he said in part it is scarcely
within the province of an applied scien-
tist to become speculative yet the startl-
ing fact that the mentanicals have begun
to acquire a faculty not primarily given
them by their inventors-the faculty of
speech for their whispering can be
construed as nothing else-implies an
evolutionary process which threatens to
place them on a par with man

  what is thought the behavorists

claim it is reflex action what is lang-
uage it is the marshalling of our re-
flex actions in words animals may
think remember but lacking a vocab-
ulary save of the most primitive kind a
matter of laryngeal structure their
thinking their remembering is on the
whole vague and fleeting incoherent but
man by means of words has widened
the scope of his thinking remembering
has created philosophy literature poetry
painting has made possible civiliza-
tion the industrial era vocabulary-
the ability to fix his reflex actions into
coherent speech-has crowned him su-
preme among animals but now comes
the mentanical of his own creation
evolving language in its turn without
speech the mentanical was to all intents
and purposes thoughtless and obedient
as thoughtless and obedient as trained
domestic animals but with vocabulary
comes memory and the ability to think
what effect will this evolving faculty
have on man what problems dangers
will it pose for him in the near future 

  so wrote bane borgson seventy
years of age fifteen years after his in-
vention of the multiple mechanical-cell
and-god help us-we had not long
to wait for the mentanicals to supply
an answer to his questions

  i have told of the whispering of
my servants that was a disquieting
thing but more disquieting still it was
to hear that whispering coming over the
radio the telephone to observe cylin-
drical mentanicals listening answering
frankenstein must have felt as i felt
in those days during that period
which lasted several years things went
smoothly enough to a great extent peo-
ple became accustomed to the phe-
nomenon and decided-save for a few
men and women here and there like
to myself-that the whispering was an
idiosyncrasy of the mentanicals implicit
in their make-up and that the various


amazing stories

scientists and thinkers who wrote and
talked with foreboding were theorists
and alarmists of the extremest type in-
deed there were certain scientists and
philosophers of reputation who main-
tained them in this belief then came
the first blow the mentanical servants
ceased waiting on man

po understand the terrible nature

  x of this defection one must under-
stand how dependant humanity had be-
come on the mentanicals in those days
human toilers were relatively few in
number laboring under the direction of
the mentanical superintendents and also
guards in the bloody wars of a decade
before-and the ones preceding them-
the ranks of labor had been woefully de-
cimated  and it was estimated that the
growth of the machine had lifted and
was still lifting millions of workers into
the leisure class the dream of the
technocrats-a group of pseudo-scien-
tists and engineers who held forth in
--seemed about to be fulfilled

  but when the mentanicals struck the
whole fabric of this new system swayed
tottered food ceased coming into the
cities distribution of food supplies
stopped not at first did starvation
threaten men and women fetched food
from the supply depots but in a few
weeks these depots were emptied of their
contents then famine threatened not
alone in new york chicago san fran-
cisco montreal but in the great cities
of europe the strange the weird thing
about it all was that men were still able
to talk to one another from city to
city boston spoke to los angeles and
buda-pest to warsaw listeners tuned
in with receiving sets speakers broad-
casted through microphones and the
newly improved television-cabinet but
the grim spectre of want soon drove
them from those instruments and in
the end city was cut off from city

and country was separated from country

  but before that happened man talked
of subduing the mentanicals scarcely
realizing as yet his utter helplessness
in the face of their aloofness but the
mentanicals came and went whispering
gliding indifferent to his plotting and
planning then man went mad he
sought to destroy the things of his own
creation the machine it was cried
had evolved too far the machine must
be annihilated so starving millions
sought to fall upon the machines and
tear them to pieces all over the civi-
lized world they attempted this but
without weapons or tools of any kind
the attempt was doomed to failure a
few mentanicals were destroyed a few
automatic devices but the power was
with the ensouled machine and the on-
slaughts of man were repulsed with
comparative ease

  those terrible times how can i
ever forget them i was but thirty-
three and newly married marna said
breathlessly why cant we strike at
the root of all this

   how

   by attacking the factories that pro-
duce the mentanicals the power-houses
from which they derive their energy
 listen i cried

  from the street rose the panic-
stricken cries of the mob the shrill
blare of alarms marna shuddered
morrow entered the room breathing
heavily his clothes torn disordered
god he said theyve beaten us back
theres no getting at them

   the wages of sloth i said of
greed

   what do you mean 

othing i said but i re-
 membered that speech of den-
sons fifteen years before-i was only
a youngster then-the speech he gave a
month before his arrest and execution
the mentanicals



man waxes great by his control of the
machine rightly utilized it is a source
of leisure and plenty for the race but
rob him of that control evict him from
the industrial process allow the machine
to be monopolized by a class and his
doom is certain

  morrow sank into a chair his face
was thin haggard looking we all
showed signs of fatigue and hunger

   food he said its giving out i
shudder to think what the future holds
in store for us

  is there no solution i asked
he looked at us slowly i dont
know perhaps   

  years before morrow had been an
engineer he was nearing seventy now
-he was marnas uncle his had been
one of the voices raised in warning
yet he had not been like denson he
had wanted to stand between and seem-
ingly there had been no standing be-
tween

   a charnel-house he said the city
will become that all the cities millions
must die marna shook uncontrollably
all he said save those who can reach
food and live

  reach food and live it had come
to that our boasted civilization the
mentanicals he said are ignoring man
they will not harm those who blend in
with the machine dont you under-
stand he said at length yes i
replied thinking intently yes i think
i do you mean that the automatic
processes of making fd still continue
and will indefinitely that we must make
our way to those places

   we must-or perish

  it seems scarcely credible i know
but we of the leisure-the cultured-
class were ignorant of just where our
food was raised and manufactured
human labor had been reduced in our
cities to a minimum had been seques-
tered shut away for fear of rebellion

those who might have been able to lead
us aright act as our guides were pris-
oners-prisoners in the power of men-
tanicals 

   so began that ghastly hunt for
food people pouring through the arti-
ficial canyons of great cities collapsing
in thousands on their streets dying daily
by the hundreds the tens of hundreds

ow much of this agony and suf-
fering the mentanicals under-
stood will never be known they came
and went seemingly indifferent to the
fate of man whose service they had
deserted in the privacy of their own
homes or in certain public places men
and women smashed machinery auto-
matic devices nothing sought to stay
them it was only when they strove to
attack sources of power of public utility
that their actions were arrested there
was that devoted band of scientists that
sought to paralyze the energy-stations
and was wiped out to a man doubt-
less many such bands perished through-
out the civilized world but soon all or-
ganized efforts were swept away by
famine  by the growing need for
sustenance

  that hunt for food how can it
be described stript of the veneering
of civilization man ran amuck hun-
dreds of thousands fled the cities but
the huge farms and orchards run solely
by automatic devices under the superin-
tendency of mentanicals were sur-
rounded by sheer walls too high to
scale nor in many cases did men know
what lay behind those walls they ate
the coarse grass and thistles of open
places the barks and leaves of trees
and for the most part died in abject
misery many sought to trap animals
and birds but met with little success
in the face of nature raw and pitiless
men and women succumbed and but few
were able to adapt themselves to a rough

environment and live almost as savages

  i know-i fled into the country with
a million others and after weeks of
wandering of semi-starvation of seeing
human beings fall upon human beings
and feast i fled back to the city it
was deserted of man the mentanical
sanitary corps directing automatic ap-
pliances had cleared the streets weird
it was weird and fraught with terror
to har the whisperings of the mentan-
icals to watch the inhuman things glid-
ing to and fro intent on business other
than that of mankind if they had looked
like animals if   

  in an almost dying condition i came
to this spot where i now live others
had discovered it before me it is a
huge factory given over to the manufac-
ture of synthetic foods though the
mentanical superintendents have de-
serted their posts the automatic devices
go on with the tireless work of repair-
ing oiling manufacturing and we carry
out what tasks are needful to keep them
functioning

  the years have passed i am an old
man now i have watched the strange
buildings of the mentanicals rise up
around us and observed their even stran-
ger social life take shape and form in
my last years i write and print this

  print yes for the automatic proc-
esses for printing and binding and the
making of synthetic paper still persist
though the civilization that begot them
has passed away magazines and books
pour from the press in his latter days
man had asked nothing but amusement
and leisure-all except a negligible few

  art was turned over to the machine
what had been in its inception a device
for the coining of myriad plots for pop-
ular writers evolved into a machine-
author capable of turning out story after
story without repeating itself strange
strange to see those magazines issued
by the million copies to see the books

printed bound stacked useless things
some day the mentanicals will turn their
attention to them some day those
presses will cease to function mans
knell has rung i see that why then
do i write why do i want what 
write to be published in some magazine
i hardly know in all this vast city we
few hundred men and women are the
only human beings but in other cities
at other centers of sustenance men and
women exist though i believe this to
be true i cannot verify it man in his
madness destroyed most of the means
of communication and as for the rest
the airships the public sending stations
from the first they wrere in the posses-
sion of the mentanicals perhaps it is
for those isolated units of humanity that
i write the magazine the printed word
is still a means of communication not
quite understood by the mentanicals
perhaps 

that is the story that i read in the
third magazine not all that the
unhappy mayne jackson wrote-pages
were missing and parts of pages illegible
-but all that i could decipher in tell-
ing the story i give it a continuity which
in reality it lacked one wonders as to
the fate of morrow and mama men-
tioned once and then heard of no more
but at the time i gave little thought to
them-i was only overwhelmed with the
terrible certainty that the story was no
work of fiction but an actual chronicle
of what had happened some time in the
past that the cylinders were not auto-
matic robots doing the bidding of human
masters but an alien form of machine
life and intelligence-machine life which
had thrown off the yoke of man and
destroyed him useless to look further
for intelligent man all that was left
of him was the beast-men among the
machines

  filled with a species of horror at the
the mentanicals

thought with sick loathing of the whis-
pering mentanicals i straightened up
and drew my revolver i was not my-
self i tell you but animated with a
berserk fury damn you i cried
take that-and that i pulled the
trigger the roar of the discharge
crashed through the huge room but
none of the mentanicals fell their metal
exteriors were impregnable to such
things as bullets trembling from the
reaction of rage the feeling of futility
i lifted my hand to hurl the useless
weapon at the immobile cylinders and
in the very act of doing so was stiffened
into rigidity by the sound of a voice-a
human voice inexpressibly weird and
mournful was that voice heard so un-
expectedly as it was in that place and
in the moment following the explosion
of the pistol

   oh cried the voice as if talking to
itself to be chained in this spot never
to leave it never to know what that
noise means who is there it cried
who is there and then in tones
thrilling with unutterable sadness mad-
man that i am to expect an answer

  but there was an answer i shouted
in reply i can hardly recall now what
i shouted hearing that human voice
above the infernal whispering of those
mentanicals was like being reprieved
from a horror too great to be borne
and as i shouted incoherently i sprang
in the direction the voice seemed to come
from the cylinders making no effort to
oppose my doing so the wall had ap-
peared smooth and unbroken from a
distance but a nearer view showed an
opening which gave entrance to a room
that while small in comparison to the
huge one it adjoined was nevertheless
large it was lighted as were all the
rooms i had seen by a soft light of
which i could never trace the source
i entered the room calling out filled
with excitement and then at the sight of

what i saw came to an abrupt pause
for on a low dais occupying the mid-
dle of the room was the figure of a man
with lolling head only this head was
free-a massive head with towering
brow and wide-spaced eyes the eyes
were dark and filled with sorrow the
face-the face of a man in the seventies
perhaps-etched with suffering i stared
-stared in astonishment-for the man
hung as if crucified on what i at first
took for a dully gleaming cross how
can i describe it i did not see every-
thing in that first glance of course nor
in the second though i tell it here as
if i had but his outstretched arms
were secured to the cross-piece of his
support with metal bands his legs held
in the same fashion so clear was the
glass-or crystal enveloping him from
the neck down-that it was some mo-
ments before i suspected its presence
i saw the gleaming transparent tubes
through which ran a bluish liquid the
pulsating mechanism at his breast pump-
ing pumping the radiating box at his
feet which gave forth a distinct aura
i saw and could not restrain myself
from giving voice to an audible ex-
clamation good god

  the dark eyes focused on me the
lips moved who are you breathed
the man

  my name is bronson i replied 
and you

  god help me he said i am
bane borgson

  bane borgson i stared at him wide-
eyed where had i heard that name
before my mind groped now i had
it in the articles recently read you
mean 

  yes he said i am that unhappy
man the inventor of the multiple-cell
the creator of the mentanicals

  his head lolled wearily that was
fifteen hundred years ago


amazing stories

   fifteen hundred years there was
incredulity in my voice

yes he said i am that old and
for centuries i have been chained
as you see me i was eighty when my
heart began to miss but i did not wish
to die there were many things i
wished to accomplish before yielding up
life the world of man was growing
bored indifferent but we scientists-a
handful of us-lived for the gaining of
knowledge this intellect of mine was
considered essential by my fellows
so they experimented with me and fash-
ioned for my use a mechanical heart-
you see it pulsing at my breast-and
filled my veins with radiant energy in-
stead of blood radium he said that
is the basis of the miracle you see and
my body was enclosed in its crystal
casing when you are tired they said
and wish to die     but the debacle
came the accursed mentanicals turned
against me and i was left alone de-
serted before that my friends offered
me death fool that i was cried bane
borgson i refused their gift no
i told them this is but a temporary
upheaval man will conquer must con-
quer i await your return so they
left me to hunt for food and i waited
waited but they never came back un-
checked tears flowed down the withered
cheeks never he said never and
chained in my place i could sense but
dimly the tragedy that was overtaking
man the rise to power of the ensouled
machines at first they worshiped
me as a god in some fashion they
know that i was their creator and paid
me divine honors a god he said
a god i who had made the destroyers
of my kind but the centuries passed
and the superstition waned a men-
tanical lasts a hundred years and then
breaks down other mentanicals are
built fifteen generations of mentan-

icals have come and gone since the
debacle and now the mentanicals be-
lieve that they were not made by man
but have evolved from simpler median-
fcal forms over a long period of time
that is their scholars and scientists be-
lieve this though the old superstition still
lingers among thousands they have
salvaged the evidence for this new the-
ory out of the earth and the scrap-heaps
of man and have arranged them in
chronological order

   the museums i exclaimed

  he looked at me interrogatively and
i told him of the vast rooms filled with
mechanical debris

   i have never seen them he said but
i know that they exist from the talk of
the mentanicals

  he smiled sadly at my amazement

   yes he said  have learned to un-
derstand and speak the language of the
mentanicals through all the long
dreary years there was nothing else for
me to do and through all the weary
years they have talked to me asked my
advice treated me with respect have
housed me here for to some i am still
a god-like beast-man half machine-
look at this mechanical heart the me-
chanism at my feet-to the scientists i
am the missing link between that lower
form of life man and that higher form
of life which culminates in themselves
the machine yes he said the men-
tanicals believe that they have evolved
through man to their present high state
and i have confirmed them somewhat in
this for in a sense is it not true

t t e paused with closed eyes and as
-- looked at him pondered his
words scarcely believing the evidence
of my senses i suddenly became aware
of the mentanicals behind me they
had stood there a silent group while the
man on the dias spoke now their whis-
pering began softly insistently the
the mentanicals



head of the man who called himself
bane borgson lifted the dark eyes
opened they are speaking of you
said bane borgson they are asking
from whence you come you have never
told me that

  i have come i replied from
america

  america he exclaimed america has
past there is no america

  not now i said but in my time
  your time

  i come from  i said by means
of a time machine

  ah he breathed i am beginning to
know to understand so that is what
it is

  i followed the direction of his eyes
i stared i gaped for there not twelve
yards to one side of me stood the time
machine how i had failed to see it on
first entering the room it is impossible
to say perhaps the sight of the man on
the dais had riveted my attention to the
exclusion of all else but there it was
the thing i had given up hopes of ever
finding again with an exclamation of
joy i reached its side i touched it with
my hand yes it was the time machine
and seemingly undamaged i believe i
laughed hysterically the road to es-
cape was open with a lightened heart
i turned my attention to what was tran-
spiring in the room bane borgson was
talking to the mentanicals and it was
uncanny to see his lips forming their
incredible language to hear them an-
swering back at length he turned to
me listen he said tensely they have
never learned to enunciate or understand
human speech but in many ways the
mentanicals are more formidable more
advanced than man in his prime

  i laughed at this i was once more
my assured devil-may-care self and
yet they believe that they evolved from
that junk-heap in their museums

  and havent they he asked quietly

not in the way they think perhaps but
still-evolved besides you failed to see
their museums with articulated bodies of
men and beasts there is much you
failed to see he paused the mentani-
cals system of thought of science is
coherent and rational to them and if
there be contradictions well does that
interfere with them making scientific dis-
coveries transcending those of man
they have long been discussing the
phenomenon of time and the feasibility
of traveling in it i know that because i
have listened to them yet for some
reason they have been unable to make
a time machine but you know radio-
yes radio-they have been utilizing dis-
coveries in that field to send messages
back in time your coming here has
not been accidental-do you understand
that-not entirely accidental by means
of their time-radio they have willed your
coming made possible your time ma-
chine dont ask me how i dont
know not clearly but they have done it
-and you are here but fortunately it
was a creature similar to themselves they
expected to them you are merely an
omo a beast-man of the machine so
they are puzzled they dont quite under-
stand that is why they have been ex-
perimenting with you but soon they
will listen he said hoarsely cant
you realize what a menace to men of
the past of your day these mentanicals
could be oh your weapons your ma-
chine guns and gas your powerful ex-
plosives i tell you they would be as
nothing against the deadly rays and in-
describable forces these mentanicals
could bring against them can you gas
something that doesnt breathe shoot
what is practically impervious to bullets
that can blow up that can explode your
powder magazines your high explosives
at a distance of miles the mentanicals
would enter your age not to conquer
man-they know little of him regard

him as an inferior creature an evolu-
tionary hand-over of pre-machine life
-but to expand take over your cities
to    to    what do i know of their
idea of profit of self-gain and ambi-
tion but doubtless they have it listen
-the great head surged forward the
dark eyes fixed mine compellingly-you
must leap into your time machine before
they can prevent return to your own
day and age at once

  and leave you behind

  how can you take me with you that
is impossible besides i am weary of
life i have caused too much woe and
misery to want to live the mentanicals
refuse me the boon of death but you
will not refuse that gun in your hand
-there are bullets in it yet-one of

them here-

  no no

  for gods sake be merciful

  t will return for you

  you must never return do you hear
me not a second time would you es-
cape perhaps it is too late to escape
now up up with your gun aim at
the crystal its breaking brings me
peace and will distract attention while
you leap into your machine now
now

there was nothing else to do i
saw that in a flash already the
mentanicals were gliding towards me
and once in their invisible grip  i
threw up my hand the gun spoke with
a roar i heard a tinkling crash as of
glass and in the same instant vaulted
into the seat of the time machine

  it was a close thing i tell you a
mighty close thing they came for me
with a rush the high sides of the pas-
senger-seat protected me for a moment
from their deadly clutch but i felt the
time machine sway under it tilt over
in that split second before my hand
closed on the lever i saw it all the

rushing mentanicals the shattered glass
bane borgson sinking into the apathy of
death his great head lolling then i
pulled the lever pulled it back to zero

ill

  captain bronson stood up he looked
at us bleakly you know the rest
the time machine has been moved in
coming back a portion of it must have
materialized inside of a solid-the old
stone wall-and caused an explosion
but what i want to know-what has
been bothering me at times-did i do
right to shoot bane borgson i might
have escaped without that

  he wanted to die said the doctor
at length

  olson smith inclined his head i
dont see what else you could have done
to have left him there i said to
a life in death after all those years no
no that would have been too horrible
bronson drew a deep breath that
was my own thought but i am glad you
agree   

  he poured himself a drink

  if i hadnt seen you disappear with
my own eyes said the doctor

  i dont blame you said bronson
the whole thing sounds like a pipe-
dream

  a pipe-dream i murmured

  but there is another angle to it said
bronson grimly what bane borgson
said about the time-radio influencing the
building of the time machine and com-
pelling my coming oh he may have
been raving poor devil or mistaken but
remember what the professor said that
night at the dinner about something whis-
pering in his brain  well have to guard
against that

  the doctor said sadly nothingll
whisper to the professor anymore cap-
tain

  what do you mean
the mentanicals



  i forgot that wed kept it from you
  kept what

  the news of the accident on that
night you took your trip into the future
the time machine struck professor
stringer on the head

  he is dead

  unfortunately no but his brain is
affected the professor will never be
the same again

  thus the strange and incredible story
ends there is only this to add olson
smith is devoting his vast fortune and
influence to fighting the manufacture of

mechanical brain-cells for machines
what do you expect to do i demand
change the future

  perhaps he answers one never
knows until he tries

  so he goes up and down the country
the world buying up inventions chem-
ical processes it has become a mission
with him a mania but the hands of
the future are not changed by individ-
uals but by social forces and the genius
of man seems determined to lead him
into a more mechanized world

  as for the rest time alone will tell

what has gone before

gaptain spain and billy harper south sea traders and plantation owners and their
wives see a strange flash in the sky later on in the evening a strange red ray emerges
from the jungle cutting a path through the trees destroying the flagstaff and narrowly
missing the bungalow itself the two men with their manager retallick arrange to take
watches all night as they begin to suspect the strange ray may be connected with the supposed
meteorite they saw earlier spain and harper leave retallick to take first watch the two
men awake in broad daylight to find retallick has disappeared arming themselves their
wives and some of their native retainers they follow the path cut by the ray through the jungle
they come suddenly on a spaceship and are overpowered by strange beings they are
taken on board where they find retallick the space-ship immediately sets out for the
planet mars the martians turn out to be kindly folk and the little party grow accustomed
to their lot they learn the martian language and are shown many strange scientific wonders
our american friends are talking with bo-kar a martian when a gong is heard from the
depths of the ship another space-ship has materialized and shown hostile intentions

   the martian space-ship is attacked the earth people are taken to the observation
room to watch the battle they group about an apparatus which is a development of televi-
sion it is a battle of sinister rays and for a while things look as if the martians are going
to lose their first space battle however the martian ray strips a portion of the outer shell
of the attacking sphere and cracks the interior lining totally disabling it an exploring par
set out in space suits from the martian ship to investigate the disabled sphere as the party
move around in the dismantled space-ship they find the most diabolical creatures-all dead
the records cannot be deciphered so the sphere is towed to mars about six weeks after the
battle the martian space-ship sights mars a great welcome is extended to the earth people and
the returning martians after the celebrations are over and things are again normal the mar-
tians set about investigating the enemy sphere which waa brought along it is found that the
sphere came from ados a planet roughly  miles from earths moon and approximately
 miles from earth and it looks as if the adosians mean to give earth and mars
trouble the earth people had been on mars almost a year when they are summoned to
appear before the council of three they are informed that rocan martian astronomers
have kept ados under constant observation ever since their arrival and that for the last
month or so certain indications of activity have appeared on that satellites surface the
council is of the opinion that earth should be informed of what the martians have learned
of ados the satellite ados by the way is unknown to earth astronomers as it is on the
other side of the moon mars will help earth fight ados if necessary if earth will grant
them mineral concessions on its moon after a decision has been reached it is decided the
earth people shoald be sent home to acquaint earth with the facts as they really are ther
were none to tell the earth people that their troubles were only now beginning


even as i looked the ttaze opened as a man in a hurry flings wide a door
and a host of silver spheres like flies rising from ados shot swiftly upward

chapter xix

the fleet takes off

thirty space ships exact
replicas of the one that had
brought us to mars had been
built during the year and the
process of equipping them was
even now drawing to a close only
fourteen of them were to accompany us
though the balance were being held in
rediness for some operation whose scope
had not been revealed to us

  by the end of the promised week the
fourteen ships-fifteen if we include
bo-kars vessel which had now been
christened the roc a-were ready to
take off the materials we had asked for
had been prepared and stored on board
and the machines and equipment needed
to take the suggested pictures en route
had been provided together with oper-
ators to work them the whole planet
had been put to work to speed up our
departure

  ados had passed its full by the time
we were ready but its surface was being
watched until the last possible moment
and we learnt that the green haze had
persisted long after the bulks of the
earth and moon had hidden the planetoid
from sight it was quite possible that
the haze itself which seemed to extend
some distance out into the void like
a shell or perhaps an atmosphere cover-
ing ados would be remarked from earth
whether they would draw the right de-
ductions from the phenomenon of course
we could not say for my part i was
inclined to fancy that it would be at-
tributed to some unprecedented activity
on the further side of the moon the
planetoid itself must be possessed of a
very low density otherwise its influence
should have made itself felt ages before
but on the whole i imagined that it was
composed of light spongy material or

else that a good deal of its interior had
been hollowed into vast empty caverns
the martian astronomers supported the
latter view they may have had spec-
troscopic observations to back them in
their opinion but if so we heard noth-
ing of them

   the more i thought over the possibil-
ities ahead the less i liked them
anxious and all as i was to get back
to earth again i frankly dreaded the
moment when it came for us to translate
promises into action of the existence
of the martians our people would have
ample ocular proof but whether they
would credit this story of a sub-satellite
remained to be seen no doubt promi-
nent mathematicians would set to work
to prove that there could be no such
thing just as in days gone by it had
been mathematically proved that the at-
lantic cable could not be laid that men
traveling by trains at the speed of twenty
miles an hour would be killed by the
rush of air or that flight in machines
heavier than air was impossible

  even granting that i was not taken
for a fool a knave or a lunatic that
our joint story was believed with all its
implications and our suggestions ac-
cepted at their actual face value who
was to say who owned and controlled
the moon the sensible solution seemed
to be that it should be taken over and
administered by some such body as a
league of nations commission provid-
ing one could be got to function in the
face of international prejudice and
jealousy

  privily i thought that the moon was
very much of a no-mans land and that
if the martians cared to establish an
outpost there we could not gainsay them
in fact in the present development or
lack of it of inter-planetary travel as far
as earth was concerned we could not
even interfere but rightly or wrongly
they had taken up the stand that earth
terror out of space



possessed extra-territorial rights over its
satellite and it was not my place to dis-
abuse them

that last week despite the enor-
mous amount of work we crammed
into it dragged remarkably norna
and retallick were married according
to the martian rites a simple yet pic-
turesque ceremony that still lingers
in my memory mars gave them of
its best for the romance had seized on
the popular imagination and the actual
celebrations were televisophoned all
around the planet it would i suppose
have been a great event even in our own
tumultuous world on one grown old and
sated where life had become an orderly
procession of days it was something of
national importance

  there came the day of our departure
and with it we all admitted a sadness
we had grown to like the martians
once their confidence was gained and
the armor of their reserve penetrated
they proved good fellows underneath-
quiet grave people no doubt but one
felt sincere they were not demonstra-
tive yet when it came to parting we were
showered with gifts i particularly dis-
liked parting from thrang our friend-
ship with him had grown as the days
went by and to him we owed most of
the understanding we possessed of his
planet and its ways yet we left each
other with the expressed hope that some
day we might meet again

  the fifteen ships lifted one after an-
other into the thin martian air-great
golden-bronze shapes glowing in the yel-
low sunlight-up and up until the red
planet dwindled away in space beneath
us the bright spot of light that was
our earth lay over to the left of us as
we headed off to the point where she
would be six weeks hence

  out out into the cold of space we
passed into the black void where the

stars glowed like diamonds on velvet   

  our position was altogether different
this time there was no longer any dis-
trust between us we had plumbed the
depth of the martians characters and
they had done much the same to us
we possessed a better understanding of
each other and as the days went by we
were initiated one by one into the mys-
teries of space-flying and all that it im-
plied

  it was bo-kar who suggested it to us
in the first place though i know the
original idea came from norna retal-
lick as a matter of course was shown
all there was to be shown as bo-kars
son-in-law it might be necessary for him
one day to step into his commanders
shoes and i should imagine that it was
out of regard for him and the stock
from whence he sprung that norna de-
termined we should not be left in
ignorance also there was probably the
feeling in bo-kar s mind that the way
might be made smoother for him in the
long run if some of the ships could be
manned and captained by earth-men
at least it would show that the mar-
tians had no desire to drive an unpal-
atable bargain by means of a weapon
which they alone possessed

  so we were given our turns at the
controls not only that it was ensured
that not only should we be able to take
command ourselves but that we were in
a position to instruct novices

  the complicated machinery that had
at first appalled us bit by bit became
familiar to us a logical principle under-
lay each act and once the principle was
seized the rest came easy it was the
navigating that i found hardest it in-
volved intricate calculations that must be
accurate to a decimal for space-flying is
not like sea-traveling in the latter one
sets a course for a fixed object but in
the void not only is the ship itself mov-
ing but the planet that is its destination


amazing stories

is also traveling in space the rates of
speed of planet and space-ship must be
calculated and a course plotted that al-
lows the ship to intersect the orbit of the
planet at the earliest possible moment
other factors such as delays and stop-
pages have to be taken into account as
they occur and the calculations con-
stantly revised to meet the new circum-
stances as they arise but perhaps the
accompanying sketch will make the posi-
tion clearer than any mere words of
mine

  a and c are the positions of mars
and earth respectively at the time we
took off from mars b and d show the
positions the two planets should be in
relative to each other at the time of
our arrival at earth the arrows show
the direction of the orbits as will be
seen the most direct route from mars
to earth is the route a    d of
course i have not drawn the sketch to
scale

in addition to this we were taught
control of the rays and the other
methods of defense employed by the
martians and long before we were in
sight of our destination we had sufficient
grasp of the workings of the ship to take
over control ourselves and teach those
under us if necessary had it been left
to spain and myself we would have
omitted marian and arabella from this

course of instruction but for once they
opposed us said they were only too
eager to learn and pointed to norna as
an example of what women could do
they would not have it said they added
that the women folk of earth were any
way behind those of mars when it came
to a question of ability and intelligence
so much against our own wishes we let
them have their way

  in our interest in the workings of
the ship we did not forget ados that
problematical planetoid was kept under
constant observation though since our
instruments had neither the power nor
the precision of the huge affairs at the
observatory at ilan we were little wiser
than before but with the perfected tele-
visophonic apparatus on board we were
able to keep in touch with our base on
mars and we received the observatory
reports as they came to hand for the
first week or so there was little to see
but as the moon and ados again swung
around from behind the earth there
came a quickening of interest

  our first notification was to the ef-
fect that the green haze was still shroud-
ing the planetoid it had become so thick
now that the surface of ados was hid-
den from view and the magnetic re-
cording instruments at ilan indicated
that it was probably vibratory in origin
but presently we were able to pick up
the luminary ourselves and the total ab-
sence of air in the void helped our in-
struments to make up in visibility what
they lacked in actual power of mag-
nification

  our own conclusion was that the haze
must be purely vibratory our heat-
recording instruments similar in con-
struction to the thermocouple used on
earth which is so delicately adjusted
that it can measure the heat of a candle
a mile away showed us that it could
not be the result of volcanic activity or
anything that involved an actual rise in
terror out of space



temperature accordingly we had to
abandon our original theory that the
green haze was similar in its nature to
the green heat-ray with which the ado-
sian sphere had tried to annihilate us on
our voyage to mars puzzling and all
as it was we could only await develop-
ments and trust to luck to bring some
solution as our course took us past ados

  presently as our conditions for ob-
servation grew better those on mars be-
came worse the red planet was swing-
ing around on its orbit so that the sun
now rose between it and earth at
regular intervals our picture machines
recorded the movements of our planet
and its two satellites i was insistent on
this for i felt that only by presenting
a complete and incontrovertible pictorial
record could we hope to convince the
powers that be of the truth of our story
the martians and their space-ships they
would have to accept or else deny the
evidence of their own senses but the tale
of a second satellite would take some
swallowing i am not blaming anyone in
advance of course i would have felt
much the same myself in a similar situa-
tion and it was the knowledge of my
own deficiencies that gave me an acute
realization of those of others

more than two-thirds of our jour-
ney had been covered without any
untoward incident and we were just be-
ginning to hope that we would get
through unscathed when the first dis-
turbing event occurred our course had
been altered slightly to take us in be-
tween the moon and ados and it was
probably this that precipitated matters
we had been subject to magnetic in-
fluences obviously radiating from ados
for some considerable time but as we
were able to counteract them quite effi-
ciently we were not alarmed particularly
as there was nothing to indicate that they
were of a harmful nature neverthe-

less the fact that such influences were
coming over did good in that it kept us
constantly on the alert

  i think it was somewhere in the mid-
dle of the fifth week out that bo-kar
sent for spain and me the message
ran that he wanted us at once and that
we would find him in the little room he
used off the control-quarters i knew
the place we had been there several
times already and i remembered it was
fitted up as a sort of chart-room plus
living quarters it was here that as com-
mander he lived worked slept and ate
through the greater part of the voyage

  that there were others in the room
besides himself i saw as soon as i
opened the door in response to his invita-
tion to come in noma and retallick i
half-expected but the sight of the third
person one of the televisophonic oper-
ators made me wonder what was afoot
i could not think of anything that could
have gone wrong and that would in-
volve the presence of the operator

  bo-kar however did not leave us
long in doubt

  something queer has happened he
said and i have called you here think-
ing that you may be able to help mes-
sages that we cannot understand have
been coming through for some time
they are not in any language we know
but since our knowledge is limited to
rocan and the tongue you speak i
thought    however this will explain
better than i

  he turned toward the table and for
the first time i noticed that a small ma-
chine not unlike a gramophone was
standing on it beside it were half-a-
dozen black wax discs

  we take records of all messages that
come over the televisophone bo-kar
explained as he fitted one of the discs
to the machine that of course is a
necessary precaution in case we want to
refer to them later these messages i


amazing stories

speak about have all been recorded i
shall start the first one now

  the machine began with an abrupt
whirr of sound that changed instantly
to a note that seemed vaguely familiar
a note not unmusical yet not like
music as we know it my thoughts flew
back to the last night we spent on earth
and the queer stuff i had heard coming
over the radio set yet there was some-
thing different in this the other had
a smoothness a rhythm if you will this
was harsher more intense there seemed
to be an urgency in it and somehow i
could not help feeling that it was charged
with menace that it threatened

  the record ended bo-kar stopped
the machine

  well he said

tt is no earth language that i know
x i said waiting wondering if he
had any idea what it was

  for the moment we looked at each
other eye to eye then that is as i
imagined it would be he said calmly
none the less i thought this might not
be altogether unfamiliar to you am i
wrong 

  no i told him i should have
told you before thats the call i heard
the night before we first met you and
that i mistook for a call from your
ship 

  from the roca he said yes
you spoke about that just before we
met the sphere

  its certainly curious i commented
of course it looks as if theyre from
another sphere if not from ados it-
self

 bo-kar smiled oddly they come
from ados he said there is no
doubt of that our directional instru-
ments can hardly be as much out as
that despite this magnetic influence
theyre radiating

  do you think said spain abruptly

that theyre trying to send us a message
of sorts

  listen said bo-kar i shall put
the other records through and judge
for yourselves from what you hear

  there were half a dozen of them in
all and bo-kar put them through in
the order in which they had been re-
ceived each one began on a tenser note
than the last and the final one of the
six rose to a menacing crescendo of
sound that made the walls of the room
vibrate i could never have imagined
that so much terror could be conveyed
by any voice in all the universe the
one we heard was charged with some
unearthly power that flicked the raw
ends of our nerves and seared our brains
with sounds that hurt as materially as
a hot iron it ended on a single note
that lifted horror to the heights that
seemed to seize and shake us until our
very souls rattled in our bodies like dried
peas

  the end came with a harsh abruptness
that left me quivering and unmanned i
stole a furtive glance at spain he was
wiping the beads of sweat from a damp
forehead retallick looked shocked and
grave and even norna trembled the
operator had gritted his teeth at the start
and put his hands over his ears only
bo-kar alone seemed unaffected his
iron nerve was capable apparently of
standing anything

  the odd part of the whole thing was
the deadly menace of the voice the
threat of worse things it conveyed one
does not need to know a language to
realize that the warning growl of an
unfamiliar wild beast cornered by the
hunter makes its meaning plainer than
print

  there followed a little pause while
half-ashamed we essayed to pull our-
selves together bo-kar swept his eyes
around the little circle as though to sum
up the effect the demonstration had had
terror out of space



on us wc all remained in dead silence

  what do you think of it now he
asked at length

  oh the meanings plain enough
retallick burst out its a warning and
its meant for us they must be watch-
ing us must see how were heading and
reckon were coming too close i should
think theyre trying to tell us of the ter-
rible things that will happen if we come
closer

  bo-kar did not comment on that but
stared vacantly ahead as though he were
turning that over in his mind noma
plucked at his sleeve

  i think that too she said with
a shiver but i would go further
in my deductions behind all that men-
ace those threats-whatever they were-
was i thought a faint note of fear a
dread that we might see perhaps too
much that by coming nearer we might
interfere with whatever evil they are
planning

  it had not struck me before in quite
that fashion but now that she put the
idea forward i felt the truth of it

  i think nomas right i said

  bo-kar slanted his eyes around upon
spain and you he said

  im rather of the same opinion now
my partner answered but that perhaps
is merely because the others have put the
idea into my head the only thing i can
say though is that if i were in your
shoes i wouldnt let it stop me from do-
ing whatever i wanted to do

  i dont intend to let it said bo-kar
incisively

  i hadnt finished said spain coolly
he was quite calm now and had got him-
self under control again i was going
to point out though i dare-say youve
already seen it for yourself that we
wouldnt be threatened like that unless
they meant to keep us away by every
possible means now i agree with norna

there that they seem afraid and if they
are why dont you see that it means
they believe that as things are we can
donkey-lick them

  bo-kar drew his brows together in a
puzzled frown and turned to retallick

  what does the man mean he asked
some of his words seem strange to
me

  retallick chuckled and grinned at
spain im not surprised at that he
said spain always gets slangy when
he gets excited but what he means is
this and with that he put it into
words bo-kar would understand

  i agree was bo-kars comment at
the end but even if it were not so
we should go on it is our duty to learn
as much as we can of our potential en-
emies for the fate of two worlds may
hang on our knowledge i only wish
though he went on that our scientists
had been able to solve the secret of that
green ray but the machinery for gen-
erating it had been irreparably injured
by the cold of space after we captured
the sphere and its composition must re-
main unknown we however have had
bigger and better generators installed
and what our rays did once i should say
they can do again if the need arises
which i hope it wont he added

  he turned to the operator you may
go norvin he said you and your
colleagues however must take records
of every sound that comes through
whether it seems an intelligent message
or not

  the man saluted and turned to go
at that moment there came a sharp
knock on the door bo-kar strode across
the room and flung it open

  one of the officers stood there and
though he spoke to bo-kar we in the
room could hear every word he said

  we have just sighted a sphere he
announced it is going from the moon
apparently from the earthward side


amazing

stories

  towards us bo-kar asked quickly
no away i think it is attempting
flight for it accelerated at once as soon
as we sighted each other

  follow it then bo-kar snapped
but take heed that it does not lead us
into a trap

  a moment later and the great gongs
were clanging rousing the space-ship
frojn end to end

chapter xx
pursuit

so quickly had bo-kars hurried
orders been carried out that by
the time we had taken the few
steps necessary to bring us to the ob-
servation room the reaction gasses were
already roaring from our warty rear
tubes the roca had changed her
course and the silver round of the
sphere dead ahead of us seemed to be
showing a slight increase in size

  there was no doubt that the sphere
had become aware of our presence and
was inclined to regard us as hostile
even as we accelerated she veered off on
a course that would take her back to
ados with the least possible delay
apart from that there was a certain
amount of good strategy in the change
of direction with her lesser bulk she
could manoeuvre more easily but the
cigar-shaped roca even in the fric-
tionless void took time to swing around
for our own sakes we had to go can-
nily for an abrupt change of direc-
tion at the speed at which we were trav-
eling might well have meant the deaths
of us all

  it did occur to me as rather odd that
the sphere should have made no at-
tempt to show fight then i recollected
the other fourteen ships following us
some of them must be near enough for
the adosians to see in which case they

probably realized that in a straightout
fight they would almost certainly be
swamped in the end by superior num-
bers no matter what initial damage
they might inflict on one or two ships

  the rest of the fleet had been ap-
prised of the situation and were given
their orders by televisophone and pres-
ently they swung out behind us in a fan-
shaped formation with the outer ship
at each end heading out in a wide circle
at constantly increasing speed with the
evident intention of cutting the sphere
off from her home base unless the
adosian machine could develop a speed
that would leave us cold it looked as
though we might succeed after all

  the sphere looked slightly larger
now than she had a few minutes pre-
viously we were gaining on her but
whether she had reached the full limits
of her acceleration of course we could
not say bo-kar was inclined to think
that she darent stretch herself to the
utmost she might not be able to retard
in time to save herself from crashing in
a mass of incandescence on the surface
of the planetoid it was the realization
of that peril too that kept us from
rising to peak in our turn our ships
on the end of the formation which was
now beginning to resemble a crescent
were running no such risk they were
approaching ados at a slant and unless
the adosians possessed some weapon
with which we were as yet unfamiliar
there was little likelihood of them strik-
ing trouble in that direction their
speed would carry them past the planet-
oid and out of its sphere of attraction
and their instruments would warn them
in time should there be any danger of
encountering an atmospheric envelope in
which the friction might heat them up

but just as we were beginning to
plume ourselves in the hope that
the sphere would be neatly headed off
terror out of space



an unexpected thing occurred she sud-
denly changed direction slanting across
the disc of the planetoid and headed
straight for the ship on that horn of our
crescent line at the same time that
invisible infra-red ray must have leaped
from her we did not grasp what
was happening until the thin green pen-
cil began to climb up and reach out to-
wards the martian ship

  as  hurriedly reached for the emer-
gency glasses on the rack on the wall
near us i saw the others following
suit the martians on the pursuing
ship however must have sized up the
situation half-a-second sooner than we
did or perhaps her commander had al-
ready taken the precaution of donning
the ray-filtering goggles at any rate
the green pencil ray had covered no
more than half the distance when the
deep glowing crimson beam flashed out
from the martian ship and hit the ad-
osians ray squarely then began the
struggle between two titanic forces

  the martian ship must have turned
on the full power of its generators for
inch by inch it seemed the green pen-
cil swayed back on itself then of a
sudden it leaped forward again re-
gaining more than half the ground it had
lost the conflicting martian ray deep-
ened in tone glowed until it hurt the
eyes to look at it

  bo-kar beside me staring into the
vision plate uttered an exclamation
whats that i said

  hes using too much power he
answered evidently referring to the
martian ship hes too close to ados
he swung round to the televisophone
and his voice calling up the fighting
ship snapped out in staccato sentences

  conserve your power he ordered
dont deplete your generators youre
too near ados for that youll need all
your lift to keep you away

  the ship on the other horn of the

crescent was meanwhile overhauling the
sphere from the rear and as it came up
it swung its beam out on the silver
hull and from that side of the sphere
in turn there sprang another green
pencil

  bo-kar swung round to the vision-
plate and in one swift glance summed
up the situation

well try our own ray he said
i dont know whether we can
make the range but its growing less all
the time

   he gave out his orders into the in-
struments connecting the various de-
partments and a moment later the vi-
sion-plate showed our own ray reaching
out from our nose-port on three sides
now the adosian sphere was being
heated by the combined rays of the three
ships and the two green pencils it had
shot out seemed to be growing weaker

  of a sudden they both snapped out
as abruptly as man will switch off an
electric light and the sphere itself
dropped for the moment i fancied the
combined influence of the three rays had
put it out of action then i realized the
horrible truth the sphere had simply
dropped of her own accord the full
force of the rays from the martian ships
on the opposing horns of the crescent
no longer playing on the sphere struck
each other the next instant they were
turned off but in that small fraction
of time the damage had been done the
ship first to engage the adosian her
generators already badly depleted by
her initial expenditure of energy reeled
under the impact of the ray from her
sister staggered turned over and
caught by the attractive force of ados
began to fall end over end towards the
surface of the planetoid she struck
the green haze surrounding ados broad-
side on broke across the middle and
vomited men and machinery out into


amazing stories

space the green haze seemed to sag
under the force of the collision then re-
bounded like a balloon suddenly swell-
ing up and sent the broken fragments of
the martian ship hurtling out into the
void

  the other ship staggered but recov-
ered itself in time and as the full lift
of its gravity screens was turned on
rose wearily towards us

  the observation room was filled with
staccato exclamations of horror

  at least we know what that green
haze is now bo-kar said in a voice
we scarcely recognized as his but weve
paid too big a price for the discovery
a vibratory screen said norna
that exerts a repelling influence on any-
thing that comes near it

  bo-kar gave a quick jerk of his head
in effect theyve armored the surface
of ados he said but look quick
at the sphere

  the sphere itself a gleaming ball of
silver seemingly no worse for what it
had undergone was dropping town to-
wards the planetoid as it came close
we expected to see it rebound like our
lost ship from the green haze thrown
upwards but instead the haze parted
and a great rift appeared in it for
perhaps two seconds we caught the
glimpse of a dark pitted and rugged
surface not unlike that of the moon
though here and there one could see
erections of a coal-black material with
a dull shimmer of their own that looked
like huge buildings then the sphere
dropped down gently through the open-
ing and the green haze closed instantly
behind it

  for a time we could only stare at
the wavering green surface of the
planetoid as men hypnotized but if
we were frozen into inaction others had
been nothing of the sort the communi-
cator connected with one of the forward
observation compartments suddenly

called attention norna as the near-
est answered it she allowed the voice
of the speaker at the other end to come
forward in full volume so we heard
what was being said

  it was one of the picture recorders
very pleased with himself to judge from
his tone he and his brother recorder
had managed to get complete pictures of
practically every phase of the battle and
their machines were still working when
the green haze had parted revealing for
the instant that precious glimpse of the
pitted surface of ados they felt quite
certain that it would come out well

  bo-kar started from his reverie tell
him he said to norna to develop the
negatives straight away i wish to see
them as soon as possible

  norna was turning back to the com-
municator to convey the message when
bo-kar spoke again the machines
must not be left however he ran on
not even for an instant they must be
kept ready and someone in charge of
them constantly

he looked across at the three earth-
men a little more convincing
evidence for your people he said but
i fancied there was a faint under-current
of sarcasm in his voice

  i nodded i did not say what was in
my mind that the more the better since
it might all be needed yet i had no
intention of damping bo-kars hopes at
this juncture any more than i could help

  it should be an interesting record
was all i said and to hide my face lest
he might see there what i was thinking

i bent over the vision plate again the
other ship was lifting towards us and i
could see no outward signs of the
trouble it had been through then i
looked down at the green surface of the
planetoid we did not seem to be re-
ceding  it looked as though we were
merely keeping our distance constant
terror out of space



yet  had an idea that we should be ris-
ing and the little world growing smaller
and smaller then

 bo-kar i said sharply am i
dreaming or are we falling

  -we cant be falling he answered
quickly and turned for confirmation to
the dial recorders duplicates of those in
the control room i looked over his
shoulder at them they showed us
rising to the full lift of our power

  we stared at one another you
must have been mistaken he said

  he wasnt we are falling

  we both swung round at the voice
it was noma who had spoken she and
retallick were bending over the vision-
plate bo-kar and i hurried to their
side

  slowly yet quite definitely the planet-
oid was growing we were nearer its
surface it looked larger than when i
had seen it a few minutes before so
my eyes had not tricked me in the first
place

  bo-kar said under his breath some-
thing that in anyone else i would have
taken to be an oath and flinging open
the door communicating with the con-
trol room raced through he left the
door wide open making no attempt to
bar us out and since we were all by
this time competent navigators and from
that point alone interested in the march
of events we moved forward so that
we could see and hear what was hap-
pening

  the control-captain was just begin-
ning to puzzle the matter out for him-
self in the last few seconds he had
become aware that something was
wrong and  think he was a very greatly
relieved man to find the work being
taken out of his hands whatever the
reason despite the fact that our gravity
screens were out we were being pulled
slowly yet inexorably down to the sur-
face of ados

  bo-kar pushed the control aside not
too gently and pressed one after another
of the huge bank of keys set in the con-
trol table in front of him and one after
another as the departments sprang to at-
tention he rattled out his orders

dll lift of gravity screens please
he said all sections of rocket
tubes to fire at once he gave a glance
in the vision plate before him and per-
formed an almost instantaneous calcula-
tion in his head we had swung
round a little i could see by glancing
over his shoulder and seemed to be
falling at the nose he had seen that
too as his next command showed

  forward tubes fire he commanded
maintain explosions until counter-
manded

  then to us without looking up come
in all of you and shut that door he
said you harper check me over the
vision-plate norna you and retallick
stand by general communicators spain
stand ready to transmit televisophone
orders to the rest of the fleet

  then with a rattle like that of machine
gun fire came one order after another
the rest of the fleet was told to put in
all possible lift and head direct for the
moon using its attraction against the
power that was pulling us back to ados
glancing at the vision-plate i saw that
we seemed to be gaining a little that
ados was certainly a trifle smaller now
i swung the angle round until i got the
moon the better part of four hundred
thousand miles away it loomed gigantic
above us i swept the vision plate angle
again on the receding planetoid no
doubt of it now it was growing per-
ceptibly smaller yet not so quickly as i
could have wished the green haze had
taken on an odd shimmering quality that
i fancied might be due to distance

  even as i looked the haze opened
as a man in a hurry flings wide a door


amazing stories

and a host of silver spheres like flies
rising from filth ados shot swiftly up-
ward towards us as they rose from the
opening they spread so that my eyes
were dazzled by the sunlight reflected
from their gleaming surfaces more
spheres than i could possibly count

  look out i cried scarcely aware
of what i was saying the one thought
uppermost in my mind was to give the
alarm before it was too late every
sphere on ados is streaking out after
us

  i was not so far wrong to our wor-
ried eyes there seemed literally hundreds
of the gleaming spheres hurling them-
selves towards us at a well-nigh in-
credible speed

  twice we had tried their strength
once beaten them and once failed and
now it looked as though they intended
that the third time there should be no
escape for any of us

  i exclaimed aloud as bo-kar swung
the vision-plate about so it focussed
against the moon rounding its huge
bulk apparently coming from the
earthward side were more spheres

  we were caught between two fires

chapter xxi

homeward bound

for a split second the sight stag-
gered me and an odd feeling as
though a hand were closing about
my throat came over me visions of
the utter annihilation of the expedi-
tion danced before my eyes

  i turned to bo-kar to see how he
was taking it to my surprise he did
not look in the least perturbed at the
first sight of the second party of spheres
he had merely pressed half-a-dozen keys
of the bank before him one after anoth-
er and had then turned back to stare at
the vision-plate

  there came an instants flurry in

which i was not quite sure which way
the roca was heading and when i
looked again it seemed that we were
staring down on the two flights of
spheres with the moon and ados re-
ceding beneath us then in a flash came
understanding

  we were moving in a three dimen-
sional space and were free save for
the accident of a heavenly body being
directly in our path to move in any di-
rection we pleased backwards or for-
wards upwards or downwards was all
one to us to any one used to mov-
ing in a two dimensional world where
all motion other than the circumscribed
ascent of an airplane or the descent
into a mine must be confined to the one
plane it took some time to realize that
we in the roca were subjected to no
such limitations we had merely risen
from the plane occupied by the spheres
to one far above them therefore as
far as we were concerned there was no
such thing as being caught between two
fires unless they possessed such a su-
perior speed that they could overhaul
and surround us

  as this dawned on me i began to
breathe freely again it would have
been the very worst of bad luck not
only for ourselves but for our home
planets if after having come so far
and gone through so much we should
be annihilated at the very moment our
goal was in sight

  our last manoeuvre had temporarily
checked the spheres but-as i have al-
ready pointed out-they were easier to
handle and because of their shape re-
sponded more quickly than the roca
and the moment what we had done
became apparent they altered their
course and came streaming after us on a
long slant

  the situation had all the nice begin-
nings of a stern chase but i think we all
terror out of space



decided more or less simultaneously in
our own minds that it must not be
so long that it would end on earth it
would never do to draw them after us
and have our world plunged without
preparation into all the horrors of inter-
planetary warfare we must have time
to prepare and if necessary to build
ships after the martian model and to
carry the light back to ados itself

  i found my mind actually trifling with
the possibility of sending a warning
ahead of u to earth but since this was
not the time to distract bo-kars at-
tention i said nothing the spheres were
coming up after us at a steep angle
those we had first seen rounding the
moon had joined in the flight and it
seemed as though it must be merely a
matter of seconds until the infra-red
beams with those streaks of green in
them began to stab out at us our
fourteen ships were lifting in a long
line a formation so devised that only
the end of the rear ship presented any
sort of a mark to the spheres each
ship actually covered the one in front

but as i watched i became aware
that the angle of flight had changed
again as in a dream i heard nomas
voice over the general communicators
passing on her fathers orders heard
the quick clack-clack of his fingers over
the bank of control keys and then some-
how the surface of the moon seemed
very near and very large and round
ados and the spheres were no longer
visible in the vision-plate bo-kar
altered its angle so as to sweep the
full round of the moon but look which
way we would we could see no sign of
a sphere but i did see something that
sent the blood pounding through my
veins a great round misty bulk looming
up in the sky   earth

  we had rounded the moon in our
mad flight put its surface between us

and the pursuing spheres was earth
watching 

  bo-kar turned his head slightly and
spoke to me over his shoulder what
can your astronomers see on the moon
he asked

  the question took me aback and for
the moment i did not quite grasp his
meaning he saw the blankness in my
face before i could speak and guessing
the reason of it framed the query in
another way

  how large would an object there
have to be before they could see it
he asked

  my ideas on that were hazy but i had
a vague recollection of something that
might supply him with a working basis

  i have heard it said i told him
that anything the size of a church
would be visible to some of the big
observatories

  he did not know what a church was
so i had to explain that and give him
some idea of the average dimensions of
such a building he looked a trifle dis-
appointed at the information

  its night now in the northern hem-
isphere he said and probably some
of your astronomers should have the
moon under observation i have hopes
that they might see us and take warn-
ing

  and they probably will i cried

  bo-kar seemed inclined to disagree
with that were in the shadow he
said earths shadow your planetary
home is hiding the sunlight from us

  i stared into the vision-plate what
he said seemed only too true still i
wondered there was an idea in the
back of my mind if only i could seie
and hold it then in a flash it
crystallized

  youre right bo-kar i said but
then again youre wrong were so
close to the earths shadow that were
in darkness but just stop and think of


amazing stories

this for the moment if any observatory
has its telescope trained on the moons
surface to-night well be seen if not as
ourselves at any rate as dark objects
passing swiftly across it well be visi-
ble if only by reason of what we ob-
scure in our passage

  bo-kar nodded that is so he
agreed id already thought of that
as a possibility but what i doubt is
whether we will be recognizable will
the observer realize that we are really
space-ships is he not more likely to
imagine that what he is seeing is due
either to a defect of his vision or of the
telescope or even perhaps to some for-
eign substance in the atmosphere through
which you remember he is looking
wre must appear very small even in the
largest telescope

  i could think of nothing to counter
that and in the end agreed that he was
probably right

our upward course was still taking
us between the moon and earth
though both were now sinking away be-
neath us and soon we were able to see
those two bodies and ados itself occu-
pying the plane we had left the
planetoid still glowed greenly the haze
itself seemed to be pulsing but the
spheres were nowhere to be seen that
however proved nothing at this im-
mense distance they would appear in-
credibly small anyway and if following
our example with the earth they had
got into the moons shadow they would
be invisible against the black background
of space

  my own feeling however was that
realizing we had the heels of them the
spheres had given up the pursuit and
returned to their base bo-kar was
inclined to agree with me in this never-
theless he insisted that a strict watch be
kept from now on

  partly as a consequence of this in-

terruption and partly to conserve our
fuel and use the earths attraction to
draw us forward we swung into the
planets orbital path actually it looked
as though we would meet head on
though i knew the gravity screens would
be called into operation in time to pre-
vent any such catastrophe

  a day or so later we entered the at-
mosphere at an angle and so swift was
our descent that we were hovering bare-
ly a thousand feet or so above the
ground before i quite realized where
we were the place was unfamiliar to
me but it was evident we were some-
where either in the united states or
canada

  a word or two with bo-kar told me
what had happened recollecting what
we had told him that the centres of the
worlds civilization lay in europe and
north america and that all other things
being equal we would prefer to land
amongst people of our own nationality
he had naturally chosen the largest con-
tinent available he seemed quite
proud of the result and we had not the
heart to disabuse him

  however even though we were not all
american i could not see that it mat-
tered much the peril we had come to
warn the world against was hat of the
whole planet not of any one nation to
a martian from a land where all bar-
riers of divergent nationalities and
languages had long been removed any
other attitude would have seemed incom-
prehensible

  the fourteen ships in a compact
formation now were drifting slowly
along our main side windows were
open and we could see practically all
around us rettalick came in with noma
just then stared about him at the land
scape and gave an exclamation

 do you know where we are i
asked and he nodded

  ive been here before he said by
terror out of space



the look of things we cant be far from
new york

  he turned and said something to bo-
kar that i did not catch bo-kar passed
a curt order or two over the com-
municator and slowly we began to rise
then as we found an upper level headed
almost due east at a lively clip

  retallick had not been wrong in
about an hour we sighted the city and in
another twenty minutes or so we were
floating gently above it

the martians gasped at the sight
it was the first view any of them
had ever had of a civilized city on earth
and the towering buildings and the teem-
ing multitudes must have stunned them
momentarily we were close enough
now for people to see us traffic in the
streets began to tangle and people to
stare up at us i learnt afterwards that
we were responsible for the biggest
traffic snarl and the greatest number of
stiff necks in all history

  retallick was making some prepara-
tions the sight of which made me ask
what he was going to do he winked at
me

  im handling this end harper he
said i worked on one of the papers
here once and there may be some fel-
lows about who still know me weve
got a story we want it to go round the
world as quickly as possible and im
trusting to my ex-brothers of the press
to do what they can

  i noticed he did not mention the name
of the paper that had once claimed his
services though perhaps this was just
as well for in the next breath he began
to add certain libelous details that may
or may not be true

  but how are you going to land i
queried theres no landing ground
about here large enough

  we-norma and i-will land on the
top of wool worths he said the

empire state building would be more
spectacular of course but the formers
better for our purpose

   can you do it-without danger i
mean 

  he nodded of course the grav-
ity screens will do whats necessary
anyway weve a bit of time to think
about it new yorks got to be told
first who we are and what we want
how

  by way of answer he seated himself
at the table drew a sheet of paper and
fountain pen from his pocket and wrote
for some time in silence he held up
the finished product for me to read
the message ran

  we the undersigned are earthmen
who have been on a voyage to mars in
a martian space-ship we have learnt
of a danger threatening the world and
have come to tell earth of its peril the
martians have come with us in their
space-ships which you see floating above
you but they have come in peace with
the express intention of aiding us against
a peril we cannot face ourselves two
of us the writer and his martian wife
will descend on the top of the wool-
worth building thirty minutes after this
note has been dropped and wish to meet
those who can arrange to come and
inspect our ships and be given convinc-
ing evidence of the truth of our story
now what about it said retallick
as i finished and handed the message
back to him

tt will do i said i would have
put it in another fashion myself
still there was nothing much in it over
which to quarrel

he scrawled his name at the foot
handed it to me to sign then passed it
round for signature to the others who
had come in in the interval that done
he enclosed it in a thin metal cylinder
bo-kar handed him attached a sort of


amazing stories

parachute to it and turned once more to
us

  well sail over times square and
drop it there he remarked

  one of the ports had already been
opened and we went and stood by it
as we drifted on when we had reached
the position he wanted and dropped as
low as we dared he released the par-
achute it slid slowly down to earth
falling across the feet of an innocent
citizen he eyed the affair doubtfully
for a moment stared up at us and then
back at the thing over his feet

  pick it up you fool retallick
called

  i	doubt whether his voice reached the
man but he bent down and picked up
the cylinder nevertheless the top part
of it was open with portion of the
paper sticking out the man seized it
glanced through it then read it out aloud
with a crowd beginning to look over
his shoulder

  someone began shouting the crowd
increased in size the paper was passed
from hand to hand no sooner had a
man read it than he jerked his head
up and stared at the bulk of the roca
as though he could not believe his eyes

  retallick came back from the open
port thats that he said ive
started the good work and inside thirty
minutes well see how new york has
reacted to our message in the mean-
time norna and i had better slip off aud
fix on our gravity shoes

  he meant those wire-meshed things
whose acquaintance we had made the
day our adventures began and without
which the martians found it impossible
to walk with comfort on our heavier
planet

  retallick looked at me thoughtfully a
moment then youd better wear them
too when you first land he said and
by that he included all us earth-people
youve been so long used to the lighter

  gravitational pull of mars that youll find
it an effort to move in comfort otherwise

  it was an aspect of the case that had
not occurred to me before but one
whose force i recognized the moment it
was put to me

chapter xxii

 a world convinced  

before the stipulated thirty min-
utes had quite elapsed a little
group had collected on the top of
the building where our ambassadors
were to be set down we trained our
view-finders on them but there was
nothing about any of those assembled to
indicate who they were retallick cheer-
fully admitted that they might be either
a reception committee come to give him
and norna the freedom of new york
or a squad of keepers gathered to hale
them off to the nearest psychopathic
ward

  it was an observation that did not
strike me as humorous the latter part
of it shot too close to the unpleasant
possibilities i had envisaged all along for
it to be at all palatable i could not rid
my mind of the feeling that our own
story of ados and its inhabitants was
quite the maddest tale this world of ours
had ever heard and i expected nothing
less than polite disbelief not that i
would blame anyone for that a year
ago i wouldnt have believed it myself

  some of our doubts however were
set at rest when we saw retallick shak-
ing hands with several members of the
group and then presenting norna to
them she was not as tall as the aver-
age martian nevertheless in the blue
tunic she wore after the fashion of her
country she would have been a conspic-
uous figure even if she hadnt been half
a head taller than the others there

  presently retallick looked back to-
wards us and signalled the roca to
terror out of space



descend and lower the ladder when
we did so he sent norna up first and i
expected him to follow but he stood
to one side and motioned several of the
group to precede him i counted half a
dozen in all norna made them known
to us as they came on board

  two of them were city officials
whose exact positions i have long since
forgotten one was a newspaperman rep-
resenting a news-syndicate the fourth
who was introduced to me as captain
mackin i took to be a military man of
some sort but it was the other two who
made the deepest initial impression on
me dr duncan and professor foster
i was told they were they both seemed
scientists of some sort or other and
foster i could see at a glance was an
englishman certainly new york must
have hustled to get six such men along
so quickly but actually as i was pres-
ently to learn it was no mere accident
 r
that brought them together

  they stood in the doorway looking
interestedly about them after the intro-
ductions until retallick came on board
then this way gentlemen please he
said and led them into the observation
room it looked more like the begin-
nings of a conference than the visit of
inspection i had anticipated particularly
as retallick handed them all seats the
communicating door was still open and
glancing back over my shoulder i saw
that the ladder was being hauled on
board a moment later the side-port
closed with a clang and the roca be-
gan to rise at once

  none of the visitors seemed in the
least put out by that though they must
have been aware what was going on i
was beginning to feel a trifle mystified
myself however when retallick cleared
the air by calling across the room to
me

  were off to washington harper
he said and ill have to take over con-

trol as our martian friends dont know
the course will you and bo-kar carry
on here

  i nodded all right i said but
what am i to do

  dr duncan looked up at me with a
pleasant smile mr retallick has al-
ready given us a rough idea of your
mission here he said easily may
i say at the start that it is a welcome one
and that seems likely to solve some mys-
terious occurrences that have been per-
turbing us here of late

  how much i said do you know
and how much dont you

  putting it in a nutshell we know
that you people have been to mars and
back and that in the interval youve dis-
covered that behind that green haze
that seems to be arising in space on the
invisible side of the moon is a malignant
entity that threatens the existence of
our planet no less than that of mars
when i tell you that several times with-
in the last year we have been visited by
calamities that we could only attribute
to an extra-terrestrial agency you will
understand that we wont find your story
very difficult to believe

that was a good enough start for
me at least we were not going to
be classed as liars or lunatics dr
duncans mention of calamitous visita-
tions excited my curiosity but i de-
cided it was better to tell him what he
didnt know rather than waste time ask-
ing him questions that could very well
be dealt with later

  i had been more or less prepared for
some such eventuality and feeling that
i would have to make my tale as com-
pact as possible i had already pruned it
over in my own mind so that when the
need arouse i was able to present the
salient facts as they affected earth with
as little loss of time as possible i was
rather surprised at the reception ac-


amazing stories

corded my story it seemed they were
quite prepared to accept the possibility
of an inter-planetary invasion they were
even prepared to admit the likelihood of
a hitherto unsuspected form of life on
the face of the moon turned away
from us but when i mentioned our sec-
ond satellite for the first time i saw ex-
pressions of incredulity cross more than
one of the faces opposite me you see
for more than thirty years the possibility
of an intelligent and highly civilized race
on mars had been discussed in public
and in private and the world was more
or less used to envisaging such a thing
but it had never before been suggested
as far as my knowledge went that hid-
den behind our moon was a planetoid of
any sort i could see it would take some
work convincing my audience but i had
no intention of wasting words if i could
help it the complete pictorial record
we had prepared against just such a
contingency was in readiness the high
lights had been picked out and the films
themselves could be screened in a
moment

  it was only a step or two from where
we were to the projecting room so i in-
vited them along merely stating that i
could show them something that would
go further towards proving the truth
of my tale than any mere words

  noma bless her heart must have
guessed from the beginning what the
trend of things would be she had one
of the martian operators and a pro-
jecting machine in readiness and it
was only a matter of selecting the rec-
ords that would give the most convinc-
ing pictures in the shortest possible
time those of life on mars interest-
ing as they were i left for a more
opportune moment concentrating simply
on such as had to do with ados

  i had the operator begin with those
we took early in our journey across
space ones that showed conclusively

the position ados occupied in relation
to earth and the moon as they were
screened i watched the faces of the six
anxiously and gradually i saw a dawn-
ing conviction steal over one countenance
after another it was when we came
within visual distance of ados and were
able to show the green haze in its en-
tirety that i caught a simultaneous gasp
of amazement from the group the ef-
fect for them was no doubt heightened
by the fact that these martian pictures
were taken and shown in their natural
colors not a thing was omitted they
saw the fleeing sphere disappear through
the opening in the haze after that bat-
tle in which one of the martian ships
had become a casualty then came the
moment when the haze opened again
to allow the fleet of spheres to stream
out in pursuit of us and after that pic-
ture followed a wide-angle shot show-
ing how nearly we were caught between
two fires

every detail of that headlong flight
of ours was recorded there our
swinging around the moon with shot
after shot of our cameras showing the
vivid details of its surface ados van-
ishing behind the latters silver bulk
the earth gleaming roundly in space
ahead of us

  professor foster turned to me as the
whirr of the projecting machine ceased
abruptly

  thats convincing enough for me
mr harper he announced what
do you say duncan

  the other hesitated he was an as-
tronomer not unknown to fame and
that such a man should find it hard to
recast the ideas of thirty years on the
strength of a few pictures was quite
understandable

  i think he said slowly that mr
harper has shown us enough to enable
us to verify the rest by calculation and
terror out of space



experiment now we know what to
look for no doubt we shall find it with
the greatest ease

  i glanced at him sharply i was not
quite sure that there wasnt an under-
current of sarcasm in his words

  if youre not inclined to be squeam-
ish i said stiffly i can show you an
inhabitant of our second satellite known
to its people as ados

  what have you actually captured
one captain mackin asked in some
surprise hitherto he had seemed more
interested in the battle of the rays than
in the new satellite

  not a live one i told him the
martians took this specimen from the
sphere we fought with on our way to
mars of course he-and the others
with him-wrere dead before we could
get to them

  dr duncan turned and stared at
me by your reckoning that must be
almost a year ago he said i take
it he has-er-been preserved

  i nodded it was no time to go into
details even if i knew them all the
martian doctor in charge could tell the
two scientists all they wished to know
accordingly i led the way to the place
where the dead adosian had been kept
pending such an eventuality

  most of our officers could speak eng-
lish of a sort they had picked up
from us and those of them who were
most likely to make contact with peo-
ple occupying similar positions on earth
had devoted themselves assiduously dur-
ing the voyage to increasing their vocab-
ulary under retallicks tutelage

  the martian doctor spoke it in a
quaint clipped style but which was the
main thing he was able to make him-
self understood without difficulty and
so demonstrate to the little party the
various peculiar features of the dead
adosians anatomy a task that would
have been altogether beyond my capacity

in addition he had provided himself
with a number of photos that helped to
illustrate the matter

  foster who was something of a bi-
ologist in addition to his other qual-
ifications made some remark about
what an interesting subject for dissec-
tion the adosian would make and i
fancy he expressed a hope that at some
future date the chance might be his

  the martian doctor looked blankly at
him for a second or so then

  you would wish to cut him up to see
what is inside him he said with a
smile but that is crude if you
wish you may see now-without the
cutting up

  i had forgotten that stethoscope thing
until i saw the martian produce it he
adjusted it over fosters face placed
the eye-pieces in the right position and
said you would like to see your own
interior now

  foster laughed uneasily i fancy he
thought some sort of a trick was being
played on him however he allowed
his chest to be bared and the martian
placed the other end of the instrument
so that it would function there was
a moments strained silence

  good god foster cried duncan
i can see inside myself just as if i
wrere made of glass

 nonsense said the other
 you cant do that

  doubting thomas said the eng-
lishman see for yourself he took
off the apparatus and handed it to his
colleague

  duncan allowed it to be adjusted
though he did make some remark about
making a fool of himself at his age
a moment later came the change he
removed the eye-pieces and looked up
at us with a half-ashamed expression
on his face

  i apologize he said contritely but


amazing stories

the thing was too incredible for words
it still is how do you do it

  the martian doctors black eyes twin-
kled that he said deliberately is
a secret but one we shall have no hesi-
tation in giving to you earth peoples
should you prove worthy

  but think of the revolution in diag-
nosis foster murmured it would
abolish all the need of exploratory op-
erations harper have these martians
any more surprises like this this beats
the x-ray

  the planets full of them i said
extravagantly but id suggest you
have a look at our adosian friend first
or well be at washington before weve
well begun

  i left them in charge of the mar-
tian doctor who was far better fitted
than i to pilot them through the ex-
amination it was not the kind of thing
i could interest myself in so i stood
to one side until they had finished

  harper said duncan coming back
to me everything you have told us so
far has been borne out by what we have
seen from the build of this man and
from what we have learned of his in-
ternal organs we feel convinced that
he has come from a planet where the
pull of gravity and the density of the
atmosphere are nothing like as great
as those of either earth or mars but
how in the name of fortune they have
managed to preserve him in this state
is more than i can say dead a year
you say and yet to all intents and pur-
poses he might merely be asleep id
like to know the method they employ to
get this result

  thats another of their secrets that
theyll probably tell you about later on
i said once youve gained their con-
fidence i dont think youll find them
at all backward about sharing their
knowledge but gentlemen youve al-

ready given me a hint that you in your
turn have something to tell us and id
suggest that we adjourn- to the observa-
tion room again-the room where we
left the others you know

  of course said mackin nodding
youre quite in the dark as to our
locus standi in this affair yes it would
be just as well for you to know with
whom youre dealing and what exactly
our particular powers are youre not
the commander i take it

  i shook my head bo-kar the
martian to whom you were introduced
commands the fleet but hisinterests are
ours and he lias gone out of hi way
to trust us but i think it is only due
to him that whatever you have to say
should be said in his presence

  certainly mackin agreed its a
queer story though however foster
and duncan know a good deal more
about the business than i do and so
id better leave the telling to them

  back in the observation room with
all of our party save retallick united
again we heard for the first time the
story of the strange events of the past
year as it was told to us each part
dovetailed into the other and helped to
make a coherent whole to which we held
the key but to the peoples of earth
it must have seemed no more than a
number of isolated yet alarming inci-
dents-showing no actual thread of con-
nection between them-that culminated
at last in that mysterious threat to
their existence a threat that had brought
them within a measurable distance of
realizing the imminence of the terror
that menaced them from out of space

to begin with that descent of the
roca quite twelve months before
had not passed unnoticed a sydney-
frisco liner had seen the strange light
in the sky one or two island schooners
had remarked on it on reaching port
terror out of space



and over on florida island some of the
officials had noted the sight and won-
dered what it was it seems however
that among all those who saw it there
was no one with any pretensions to
scientific knowledge and when at last
the meagre details reached the astronom-
ical world they could only conclude that
the manifestation had been due to some
extra large meteorite and from the fact
that no damage of any sort was re-
ported it seemed obvious that it must
have fallen into the sea somewhere

  the next act in the drama was a more
spectacular one a section of the brit-
ish fleet was at anchor off portsmouth
one clear night when a body resembling
a ball of dull light as one observer de-
scribed it suddenly made its appearance
in the sky at a height that was vari-
ously estimated quite probably errone-
ously in all instances as from six hun-
dred to a thousand feet almost cer-
tainly it was much higher there was
evidently some doubt as to what the
object was and a searchlight from one
of the vessels was swung into the sky
and a few seconds later the beams from
the whole fleet were focused on the
glowing ball admitting that it was an
adosian sphere what happened next was
perfectly comprehensible the adosians
used to the destructive power of rays no
doubt concluded that the harmless
searchlights were something new in the
lethal line and that being their convic-
tion preferred to take no chances

  observers on shore from whose hazy
descriptions the account was subse-
quently compounded agreed that a spurt
of green light seemed to come from the
object in the sky the moment the search-
lights picked it up and for the next
few seconds nothing could be seen in
detail a great portion of the sea
seemed incontinently to turn to steam
a number of explosions occurred in quick
succession and brilliant lights flashed

and went out and flashed again through
the steam cloud when it finally cleared
away there vas no sign either of the
battleships themselves or of the thing
in the sky they had absolutely and
completely vanished the observers ac-
counts however were not to be relied on
implicitly for in the next few minutes all
their energies and attention was occupied
in trying to get out of the danger
zone a huge tidal wave swept the
solent rushing over all the low-lying
land adjacent it wrecked the greater
part of the shipping in the neighborhood
did incalculable damage to the docks at
southampton and all but engulfed the
isle of wight

  next day the astronomer royal an-
nounced that at a time antedating the
disaster by an hour or so greenwich
observatory had noted a peculiar stellar
missile rushing through space in the di-
rection of the earth the observers had
attempted to follow its path but present-
ly lost sight of it the chances were no
doubt that it had attained a speed that
made it invisible this report was con-
firmed in the course of a day or so by an
american message from mt wilson
pratically identical in detail with the
greenwich one again the conclusion was
that the millions of pounds worth of
damage done and the two thousand lives
lost were due to the impact of a meteorite

  scientific accounts sought a parallel
in the siberian meteorite of  and
presently tacked on to that the garbled
reports of our own visitation

  needless to say the heavens were
scanned pretty closely after this and
soon the inevitable discovery was made
of the green haze apparently emanating
from the far side of the moon an
attempt was made to link this up with
had gone before not a very suc-
cessful attempt it must be admitted and
speculation as to the possibilities of life
on the remote face of our satellite began


amazing stories

to occupy a disproportionate space in
the daily press

  the scientific press on the other hand
with a cautiousness that would have
been commendable under any other cir-
cumstances discounted any such idea
the various authorities almost without
exception attempted to trace a connec-
tion between the green light that had
flashed from the strange object just
prior to the disaster in the vicinity of
the solent and the green haze behind
the moon the latter radiated certain
magnetic lines of force whose effects
were recorded by sensitive instruments
on earth though their precise implica-
tion was far from being understood
at any rate the theory that presently
gained general acceptance was that from
somewhere in space a succession of me-
teorites of unknown composition was
bombarding the invisible half of the
moon and that those which had hit the
earth had in some fashion overshot their
mark a number of writers of scientific
fiction made the suggestion that intelli-
gent extra-terrestrial life might be at
the bottom of the trouble but in prac-
tically every case their ideas were
scouted man has become an insular
animal and it is part of his armor of
egotism to believe that no life of any
sort at all corresponding in intelligence
to his own could possibly exist anywhere
outside the earth

  two months later a fleet of amer-
ican military planes cruising by night
high up over new york were suddenly
startled by the emergence from a cloud
layer of an object they described as a
silvery ball the moment they were ob-
served a green pencil beam-it must be
remembered that the dull red carrier
ray would be invisible to them-shot out
into their midst and each plane it touched
burst immediately into flame the planes
were armed and from one a machine
gun was trained on the sphere and fired

the bullets pattered harmlessly off the
outer shell nevertheless the spheres

people must have considered discretion
the better part of valor for the space-
ship immediately rose at a terrific speed
that set the hull glowing with the fric
tion of the atmosphere the surviving
planes followed it as high as they dared
and according to their story it shot away
into space and dwindled rapidly in size
in this particular instance a private ob-
server had quite by accident got the
sphere in focus during the few min-
utes it happened to be within range
due to the cloud bank that had ob-
scured the sky very little observation
had been done that evening and this
particular man was fortunate in that
he did not start to search the sky until
a moment or so after the clouds had
drifted away

  this observer had been attracted by
the stories of the lumious green haze
back of the moon he was a member of
one or two interplanetary organizations
and had decided views on the possi-
bility of interstellar communication
probably because of these views his
theory of a spaceship even though it
agreed in essentials with the war-birds
story was frowned on in high circles

some sort of confirmation came the
next evening when new york was
rocked to its foundations by what was
apparently a series of submarine quakes
preceded by further manifestations of
the green light in the morning it was
discovered that the statue of liberty
had literally vanished into thin air the
discovery might have been made sooner
had it not been for the curtain of steam
that obscured the harbor in much the
same fashion as had happened in the
disaster off portsmouth england

  on the heels of this there came drift-
ing in via london a report that but-
tressed up the suggestion that all this
terror out of space



was directly traceable to a visitant from
another world it appears that one of
the officials from florida island in the
solomon group had occasion to go over
to our plantation--perhaps it was one
of those surprise visits that the admin-
istrative staff pay from time to time-
and found to his surprise that there
was no sign of the owners about any-
where the place had been allowed to
fall into ruin and the natives were be-
ginning to run wild they seemed more
frightened than anything else he re-
ported at first he was inclined to
imagine that we had been the victims
of foul play but a close examination
of the bungalow and its surroundings
failed to bring to light anything that
would substantiate such an idea a close
cross-questioning of the native boys at
last elicited a story that seemed to have
considerable elements of the incredible
in it in effect what they said was that
a great ship had come down from out
of the sky and taken us away by what
manner of means this resident magis-
trate for such i presume he was
managed to get dates and other vital in-
formation from the boys did not appear
but the fact remains that he was able
to fix the time of our disappearance
in such a way that he connected it up
with the meteorite the florida island
people had fancied they saw

  a meteorite as every schoolboy knows
when it is large enough to escape being
reduced to incandescent powder by the
friction of the atmosphere makes a
crater for itself when it strikes the earth
of greater or less depth according to its
size and the force of its impact an
examination of the scene of our taking-
off failed to reveal signs of such a crater
instead the rocks thereabouts seemed to
have been melted to liquid and then
later to have hardened to a lava-like
consistency over the whole of the area
that the space-ship had occupied when

at rest in the ordinary course of events
the jungle should have flowed over the
spot and hidden it from view but with
a surprising reluctance the jungle dis-
played a marked disinclination to do
anything of the sort that and sev-
eral other things he noticed seemed to
the resident magistrate to possess such
an extraordinary though entirely incom-
prehensible significance at the time that
he decided it was worth reporting to
london ilis decision was quickened by
the news that had come in on the last
mail of the mysterious events in the
northern hemisphere in fine his re-
port added yet another corroborative
detail to the theory that was beginning
to take shape in the minds of the leading
scientists of europe and america

  it presently became so plain that there
was some terror out of space that had
to be combatted that conferences between
the two sufferers england and america
were arranged with a view to finding
some means of dealing with the menace
for a variety of reasons that need not
be gone into here but that will be
familiar to every student of popularized
science the lead was taken by the amer-
icans great britain fell into step and
it was reported that supplies were be-
ing voted by both nations to enable ex-
periments with the goddard rocket ships
to be speeded up to the point where they
would become practicable space-craft
offers of assistance had been made by
german men of science who had been
experimenting on the same lines but the
rest of the nations preferred to stand
aloof pretending to see in the situation
a conspiracy between the two great eng-
lish-speaking nations to dominate the
world

an international conference was at
the moment of our arrival sitting
in washington foster had but that
morning landed in new york where


amazing stories

he had been met by duncan and mackin
the latter in his capacity of aviation ex-
pert and our arrival had seemed to them
like the hand of providence

  i could not understand however why
we had been allowed to approach so
close to the ground without any sign of
hostility being shown us and t put it
up to duncan

  well what could we do anyway he
retorted with a smile but seriously
didnt you know that the leading ship
of the fleet had approached us with a
white flag showing

  no i didnt i said retallicks
doing i suppose

  probably he agreed at any rate
as you showed a disposition to parley we
could do no less than give you the op-
portunity we had  means of coun-
tering the rays and as we felt that the
slightest hostile move would bring them
down on us we knew better than to
try anything of the sort another and
perhaps the most cogent reason was that
the ships were over new york and your
message dropped before we quite real-
ized what had happened but the mes-
sage the fact that it was in english
and that it bore the signatures of the
people whom we now knew to have dis-
appeared a year back convinced us
speedily enough that we had friends
not enemies to deal with

  he stopped and looked around our
little group at the white strained faces
of us earth-people and the grave yet
strong and calm features of the mar-
tians then addressed himself to bo-kar

  i think he said slowly that we
of earth are fortunate in having as our
allies you of roca for so they tell me
you call the planet mars in many ways
you are ahead of us in certain depart-
ments of physical science you are admit-
tedly our superiors but no doubt we
in our turn can teach you many things
it is my hope that the knowledge we

each possess may yet become the com-
mon knowledge of all

  bo-kar gravely inclined his head
well said earthman called dr dun-
can he answered we have too much
to give each other-we two peoples-ever
to quarrel over the manner of the
giving

  but i thought of the moon and its
reputed mineral wealth and i won-
defed

  while rome burns

never want to go through the
ordeal of that day at washington
flain

  the international conference
called to devise ways and means
of combatting the menace was in full
session when we arrived and we were
immediately hailed before it i am not
going to describe in detail the cross-
examination we were put through or
the blank incredulity that we met at
every turn i should have thought that
our exhibits were sufficient to convince
even the most skeptical but there i
was wrong the fact was that we were
dealing with adventures and conditions
beyond the experience of the average
man we told of things that ran con-
trary to the accepted doctrine and like
every other exponent of the strange
and new our purpose was misconstrued
and our motives suspected yet in the
end we triumphed though not as com-
pletely as we had hoped

  retallick and i as the spokesmen of
our party were put through a pretty
severe grilling more than once i almost
lost my temper at the questions hurled
at me but retallick never turned a hair
duncan and foster came to our aid
when the chance offered told what they
terror out of space



had seen and the conclusions they had
drawn and urged that the conference
itself should adjourn to permit of our
picture records being screened

  oddly enough there was the hottest
debate about this i think some of the
delegates were extremely unwilling to
be convinced and in the end it was only
bo-kars growing impatience that swayed
the gathering in our favor in the
midst of it the martian whom for the
first time in our acquaintance i saw
with a disgusted frown on his face
jumped to his feet and said something
to retallick i did not catch the words
but it was plain from the tone that
bo-kars patience had been frayed to
breaking point

  retallick caught him by the arm and
whispered something it seemed he was
trying to persuade his father-in-law to
be seated again but bo-kar had no such
intention instead seizing the oppor-
tunity of a momentary lull in the dis-
cussion he turned towards the presiden-
tial chair and commanding attention by
virtue of his dignified bearing and su-
perior height poured out a flood of
rocan

  all eyes turned towards him whats
he saying said someone

  retallick sprang up beside him id
better interpret he said taking the sit-
uation in his own hands ill warn
you he ran on with a wry smile that
it isnt pleasant hearing but i think i
can speak for the rest of our party and
say that bo-kar is voicing the opinions
of us all

  go on then mr retallick said the
president quietly i think that from
the start he was on our side and by
this time was thoroughly tired of the
political and international wrangling that
had insinuated itself into the discussion

  what bo-kar had to say was very
much to the point though as retal-

lick had suggested it was not very
pleasant hearing in fine bo-kar said
that he and his people had come here
more or less out of goodness of heart-
that was retallicks translation which
i suspect was not strictly accurate-to
help earth out of a difficulty they-
the martians-had been met by doubt
and disbelief they were prepared to
face and overcome incredulity but they
could not understand the type of mind
which knowing there were proofs in
existence could waste time debating
whether it were worth viewing them
or not such procrastination at such
a time was almost unbelievable bo-
kar speaking for himself wished to
say that rather than face out the wran-
gling and the petty differences between
nations that seemed the order of the
day he would withdraw his people and
his ships sail away into the void and
leave earth to fend for itself

  retallick finished and turned to bo-
kar as though he thought the other
might still have more to say bo-kar
waved him to sit down and faced the
conference himself

  mr retallick he said speaking in
halting english has told you much
what is in my mind i have allowed
him to say it for me for i cannot as
yet speak your language very well and
i do not want through my ignorance
of your phrasing to have mistakes of
my meaning made but i add this that
our battle is yours and if we are to
fight it for you without help from you
you can look for no help from our
civilization now or later we of roca
do not understand why you should hesi-
tate with the foe at your door your
scientists can tell you that what we say
is true once they have examined our
data that is enough why then should
some of you think that in this there is
a plot of the larger nations to swallow
up some of your smaller powers you


amazing stories

no longer belong to this nation or that
you are the earth people who should
unite to face a menace from beyond
why waste time about it  i have
spoken and i go

  he turned as though to leave the
room with a quick movement the
president left his seat crossed the room
and caught bo-kar by the hand

there is no need to leave he
a said i shall see you through

  in that he showed he was a judge of
men whether they came from earth or
mars but after all he was only half a
second ahead of it he had no sooner
finished speaking than one of the brit-
ish delegates jumped to his feet

  mr-er-bo-kar is right gentle-
men he declared were fiddling
while rome is burning what do our
petty jealousies matter in the face of
this larger menace indeed i say that
if in the end it can weld us into one
people with one heart and one aim it
lias not been without its uses

  i think said the president smiling
that we are all agreed on that and
i would suggest we should ask our mar-
tian friend that such of his picture
records as can be shown here be brought
in at once for our conviction

  the tide had definitely turned there
was no doubt about that and bo-kar
sensing something of it stared frankly
bewildered at the change of expression
on the faces of those in front of him
he could not understand people who
refused to face facts yet could be
swayed so easily this way and that by
mere words

  well to make a long story short the
picture records were brought in and
given a complete screening before on
the roca for the benefit of duncan
foster and their colleagues we had
merely picked out the high lights but

now everything we could screen was
shown from end to end

  the screening itself took several hours
but from start to finish the audience
sat enthralled and when it came to the
battle in the void from more than one
came gasps of amazement and i im-
agine fear it was then that mackin
who was sitting next to me turned and
whispered

  harper he said i think i see
now why these adosians of yours at-
tacked the british fleet and destroyed
the statue of liberty

  why i asked so far i had failed
to trace any logical connection between
the two incidents

tts quite simple he said their
a chief weapon is the ray and nat-
urally they regard anything of similar
nature as a possible weapon of offense
they attacked the british fleet because
of its searchlights and the beam from
the lantern on the statue of liberty
no doubt seemed to their minds to pos-
sess lethal possibilities also so they
got in first

  it seemed quite a feasible solution and
i said so also it appeared to me it
might be good policy to cut out every-
thing in the nature of a swinging
beam as long as there was a likelihood
of an attack by the adosians it would
mean that a lot of light-houses would
have to go out of business but no doubt
shipping could be warned of what was
being done

  mackin nodded at my suggestion
much the same idea had come to him
he admitted at any rate he would
put it up to the proper authorities and
see that they carried it through

  the exhibition came to a close and
for a time a death-like silence fell on
us all again it was one of the brit-
ish delegates the same who had spoken
before who forced the issue
terror out of space



  i think he said we have seen
enough to convince us the reason
why this planetoid ados has not been
discovered before i leave to one more
competent than i but from what i
have been told i should imagine that
it has already manifested its presence
to our astronomers though possibly
they have drawn wrong deductions from
those manifestations i am given to un-
derstand however that its density is
very low and possibly therefore such
influences of an attractive nature as it
exerts on our planet have been hitherto
negligible but it was not of that i
wished to speak i am taking it for
granted that we are now of one mind
for i cannot imagine how anyone could
have seen what we have seen and heard
what we have heard and remain uncon-
vinced that being so i would ask
that our martian friends advance some
formal suggestion as to a plan of cam-
paign

  bo-kar had followed the englishmans
speech with close attention and what
he did not understand himself retallick
had made plain and now at the end he
spoke again once more apologizing for
his inadequate knowledge of the lan-
guage what he had to say was just
as simple and direct as before

  he saw no gain he said in sitting
down and waiting for the adosians to
take the initiative they had already
given ample evidence of hostile inten-
tions therefore he suggested that
we carry the war into the enemys coun-
try one of course could not say
how many of the spheres were in ex-
istence and the vibratory screen about
ados too presented a difficulty though
the latter was a problem that the com-
bined wits of the martians and earth
scientists could no doubt overcome his
own men would be happy to begin
experimenting in collaboration with
earth scientists practically at once

  as for space-ships fifteen of the
martian vessels were now on earth
others were setting out from their home
planet and should be here soon and
more would be commissioned as they
were built they could be built readily
enough here on earth from the plans
he would supply if the work was
pushed on and every effort concentrated
on it there was no reason why a fleet
should not be ready to take off inside
of three months meanwhile some of
the martian ships could be manned and
commanded by earth-men every mem-
ber of the earth party who had been
to mars had undergone a course of
instruction that made them capable of
taking complete charge of a space-ship
earth crews could be put through train-
ing in a week that would fit them for
their duties

  understand he went on that we
of roca for so we call our planet which
you know as mars are giving you of our
secrets and our discoveries we merely
ask that they be made common to the
peoples of this world not that they
should be held by one or two nations
alone and in return there is one thing
we seek 

  he paused and looked around before
he went on as if to feel in advance
the temper of the gathering towards the
proposition he meant to submit it was
this moment i had dreaded all along
but i need not have worried retallick
and he must have talked the matter over
in all its possible aspects and implica-
tions for

 who owns the moon bo-kar
 asked abruptly

 for a space there was silence i
imagine that it was a question which
shot at them in that fashion took more
than one of the delegates aback

  why said one of the englishmen
slowly nobody does unless there hap-


amazing stories

pen to be any inhabitants there in which
case their right is surely incontestable

  i guess said one of the american
delegates drily that whoever lands there
first will certainly claim it for his own
people its not so near or so valuable
that anyone will dispute that

  so i thought said bo-kar catch-
ing at the sense rather than at the
actual words themselves well know
you earth-men that we of roca have
interests in your moon we have al-
ready effected a landing there and have
discovered minerals of which there is a
shortage on mars and which we would
work for our own benefit so now this
is my bargain that in return for what
we are ready to do to help you we be
allowed undisputed right to work now
and hereafter all such mineral depos-
its as we may discover on that side
of the moon remote from earth should
you earth-men wish to work similar
deposits on this face of the moon we
will not come into conflict with each
other

  sounds fair enough said one of
the americans its pretty much of
a no-mans-land anyway i should say
and if you people can find a way of
getting over the lack of atmosphere and
the difficulties of temperature i for one
would say go to it it looks to me

too as though this meetings going to
be unanimous on the matter

  i imagine said the president su-
avely that what we are going to gain
from intercourse with our martian allies
will far outweigh the value of any con-
cessions they desire on the moon after
all it isnt our exclusive property
so far no nation on earth has ever
attempted to lay claim to it and so
we shouldnt make a virtue of being
magnanimous over what isnt ours to
give if the doctrine of priority of
occupation counts for anything i think
the martians have a better right to it
than we have at the worst we can
say that if they care to work any de-
posits they may find on the moon within
the limits they themselves have set they
need anticipate no interference from us
that i think will meet with every-
ones approval

  seemingly when a vote was taken it
did the trouble if any would come
later when the full extent of the moons
mineral wealth had been ascertained be-
yond all possibility of doubt meanwhile
we had reached the stage when the rep-
resentatives of most of the powers that
counted had become convinced that
earth was facing a very real and pres-
ing danger that must be dealt with be-
fore it assumed proportions with which
we could not cope

the cfold-bug

   by edgar allan poe
   

        what ho what ho this fellow is dancing mad 
        he hath been bitten by the tarantula

                             all in the wrong

many years ago i con-
tracted an intimacy with a
mr william legrand he
was of an ancient hugue-
not family and had once
been wealthy but a series of misfor-
tunes had reduced him to want to
avoid the mortification consequent upon
his disasters he left new orleans the
city of his forefathers and took up his
residence at sullivans island near
charleston south carolina

  this island is a very singular one
it consists of little else than the sea
sand and is about three miles long its
breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of
a mile it is separated from the main-
land by a scarcely perceptible creek ooz-
ing its way through a wilderness of
reeds and slime a favorite resort of
the marsh-hen the vegetation as might
be supposed is scant or at least dwarf-
ish no trees of any magnitude are to
be seen near the western extremity
where fort moultrie stands and where
are some miserable frame buildings ten-
anted during summer by the fugitives
from charleston dust and fever may
be found indeed the bristly palmetto
but the whole island with the exception
of this western point and a line of hard
white beach on the seacoast is covered
with a dense undergrowth of the sweet
myrtle so much prized by the horticul-
turists of england the shrub here

often attains the height of fifteen or
twenty feet and forms an almost im-
penetrable coppice burthening the air
with its fragrance

  in the inmost recessor of this cop-
pice not far from the eastern or more
remote end of the island legrand had
built himself a small hut which he oc-
cupied when i first by mere accident
made his acquaintance this soon ripened
into friendship-for there was much in
the recluse to excite interest and es-
teem i found him well educated with
unusual powers of mind but infected
with misanthropy and subject to per-
verse moods of alternate enthusiasm and
melancholy he had with him many
books but rarely employed them his
chief amusements were gunning and
fishing or sauntering along the beach
and through the myrtles in quest of
shells or entomological specimens his
collection of the latter might have been
envied by a swammerdamm in these
excursions he was usually accompanied
by an old negro called jupiter
who had been manumitted before the
reserves of the family but who could
be induced neither by threats nor by
promises to abandon what he consid-
ered his right of attendance upon the
footsteps of his young massa will
it is not improbable that the relatives of
legrand conceiving him to be somewhat
unsettled in intellect had contrived to


amazing stories

instill this obstinacy into jupiter with
a view to the supervision and guardian-
ship of the wanderer

  the winters in the latitude of sulli-
vans island are seldom very severe and
in the fall of the year it is a rare event
even indeed when a fire is considered
necessary about the middle of octo-
ber - there occurred however a
day of remarkable chilliness just be-
fore sunset i scrambled my way through
the evergreens to the hut of my friend
whom i had not visited for several
weeks-my residence being at that time
in charleston a distance of nine miles
from the island where the facilities of
passage and re-passage were far behind
those of the present day upon reach-
ing the hut i rapped as was my custom
and getting no reply sought for the key
where i knew it was secreted unlocked
the door and went in a fine fire was
blazing upon the hearth it was a
novelty and by no means an ungrateful
one i threw off an overcoat took an
armchair by the crackling logs and
awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts

  soon after dark they arrived and
gave me a most cordial welcome jup-
iter grinning from ear to ear bustled
about to prepare some marsh-hens for
supper legrand was in one of his fits
-how else shall i term them-of en-
thusiasm he had found an unknown
bivalve forming a new genus and more
than this he had hunted down and se-
cured with jupiters assistance a scar-
abaus which he believed to be totally
new but in respect to which he wished
to have my opinion on the morrow

  and why not to-night  i asked rub-
bing my hands over the blaze and wish-
ing the whole tribe of scarabcei at the
devil

  ah if i had only known you were
here said legrand but its so long
since i saw you and how could i fone-
see that you would pay me a visit this

very night of all others as i was

coming home i met lieutenant g-

from the fort and very foolishly i lent
him the bug so it will be impossible for
you to see it until morning stay
here to-night and i will send jup down
for it at sunrise it is the loveliest thing
in creation

  what -sunrise 

  nonsense no-the bug it is of a
brilliant gold color-about the size of a
large hickory-nut-with two jet-black
spots near one extremity of the back
and another somewhat longer at the
other the antenna are-

  dey aint no tin in him mass will
i keep a tellin on you here inter-
rupted jupiter de bug is a goole bug
solid ebery bit of him inside and all
sep him wing-neber feel half so hebby
a bug in my life

  well suppose it is jup replied le-
grand somewhat more earnestly it
seemed to me than the case demanded
is that any reason for your letting the
birds burn the color-here he turned
to me-is really almost enough to war-
rant jupiters idea you never saw a
more brilliant metallic lustre than the
scales emit-but of this you cannot
judge till to-morrow in the mean time
i can give you some idea of the shape
saying this he seated himself at a small
table on which were a pen and ink but
no paper he looked for some in a
drawer but found none

  never mind said he at length this
will answer and he drew from his
waistcoat pocket a scrap of what i took
to be very dirty foolscap and made
upon it a rough drawing with the pen
while he did this i retained my seat
by the fire for i was still chilly when
the design was complete he handed it to
me without rising as i received it a
loud growl was heard succeeded by a
scratching at the door jupiter opened
it and a large newfoundland belong-

ing to legrand rushed in leaped upon
my shoulders and loadjd me with ca-
resses for i had shown him much at-
tention during previous visits when
his gambols were over i looked at the
paper and to speak the truth found
myself not a little puzzled at what my
friend had depicted

  well i said after contemplating
it for some minutes this is a strange
scarabceus i must confess new to me
never saw any thing like it before-
unless it was a skull or a deaths-head
-which it more nearly resembles than
any thing else that has come under my
observation

  a deaths-head echoed legrand
-oh-yes-well it has something of
that appearance upon paper no doubt
the two upper black spots look like
eyes eh and the longer one at the
bottom like a mouth-and then the shape
of the whole is oval

  perhaps so said i but legrand
i fear you are no artist i must wait
until i see the beetle itself if i am to
form any idea of its personal appear-
ance

  well i dont know said he a little
nettled i draw tolerably-should do it
at least-have had good masters and
flatter myself that i am not quite a
blockhead

  but my dear fellow you are jok-
ing then said i this is a very passable
skull-indeed i may say that it is a
very excellent skull according to the
vulgar notions about such specimens of
physiology-and your scarabceus must
be the queerest scarabceus in the world
if it resembles it why we may get up
a very thrilling bit of superstition upon
this hint i presume you will call the
bug scarabceus caput homhiis or some-
thing of that kind-there are many sim-
ilar titles in the natural histories but
where are the antenna- you spoke of

  the antennce said legrand who

seemed to be getting unaccountably
warm upon the subject i am sure
you must see the antenna i made them
as distinct as they are in the original in-
sect and i presume that is sufficient

  well well i said perhaps you
have-still i dont see them and i
handed him the paper without additional
remark not wishing to ruffle his temper
but i was much surprised at the turn
affairs had taken his ill humor puzzled
me-and as for the drawing of the
beetle there were positively no antenna
visible and whole did bear a very close
resemblance to the ordinary cut of a
deaths-head

  he received the paper very peevishly
and was about to crumple it apparently
to throw it in the fire when a casual
glance at the design seemed suddenly
to rivet his attention in an instant his
face grew violently red-in another as
excessively pale for some minutes he
continued to scrutinize the drawing
minutely where he sat at length he
arose took a candle from the table and
proceeded to seat himself upon a sea-
chest in the farthest corner of the room
here again he made an anxious examina-
tion of the paper turning it in all direc-
tions he said nothing however and
his conduct greatly astonished me yet
i thought it prudent not to exacerbate
the growing moodiness of his temper by
any comment presently he took from
his coat pocket a wallet placed the
paper carefully in it and deposited both
in a writing-desk which he locked he
now grew more composed in his de-
meanour but his original air of enthu-
siasm had quite disappeared yet he
seemed not so much sulky as abstracted
as the evening wore away he became
more and more absorbed in reverie from
which no sallies of mine could arouse
him it had been my intention to pass
the night at the hut as i had frequently
done before but seeing my host in this

mood i deemed it proper to take leave
he did not press me to remain but as
i departed he shook my hand with even
more than his usual cordiality

  it was about a month after this and
during the interval i had seen nothing of
legrand when i received a visit at
charleston from his man jupiter i
had never seen the good old negro look
so dispirited and i feared that some
serious disaster had befailen my friend

  well jup said i what is the mat-
ter now-how is your master

  why to speak de troof massa him
not so berry well as mought be

  not well i am truly sorry to hear
it what does he complain of

  dar dats it-him neber plain of
notin-but him berry sick for all dat
very sick jupiter-why didnt you
say so at once is he confined to bed
no dat he aint-he aint find no-
whar-dats just whar de shoe pinch-
my mind is got to be berry hebby bout
poor massa will

  jupiter i should like to understand
what it is you are talking about you
say your master is sick hasnt he told
you what ails him

  why massa tain worf while for to
git mad bout de matter-massa will
say noffin at all aint he matter vvid him
-but den what make him go about look-
ing dis here way wid he head down and
he soldiers up and as white as a gose
and den he keep a syphon all de time-
keeps a what jupiter

  keeps a syphon wid de figgurs on de
slate-de queerest figgus i ebber did see
ise giggin to be skeered i tell you haz
for to keep mighty tight eye pon him
noovers todder day he gib me slip fore
de sun up and was gone de whole ob
de blessed day i had a big stick ready
cut for to gib him d-d good beating
when he did come-but ise sich a fool
dat i hadnt de heart after all-he look
so berry poorly

  eh -what -ah yes-u pon the
whole i think you had better not be too
severe with the poor fellow-dont flog
him jupiter-he cant very well stand it
-but can you form no idea of what has
occasioned this illness or rather this
change of conduct has any thing un-
pleasant happened since i saw you 
no massa dey aint bin noffin on-
pleasant since den-twas fore den im
feared-twas de berry day you was
dare

  how what do you mean

  why massa i mean de bug-dare
now

  the what

  de bug-im berry sartain dat massa
will bin bit somewhere bout de head by
dat goole-bug

  and what cause have you jupiter
for such a supposition

  claws enuft massa and mouff too
i nebber did see sich a d-d bug-he
kick and he bite ebery ting what cum
near him massa will cotch him fuss
but had for to let him go gin mighty
quick i tell you-den was de time he

paper dat i found i rap him up in de
paper and stuff piece ob it in he mouff
-dat was de way

  and you think then that your mas-
ter was really bitten by the beetle and
that the bite made him sick

  i dont tink noffin about it-i nose it
what made him dream bout de goole so
much if taint cause he bit by de goole-
bug ise heerd bout hem goole-bugs

about it in he sleep-dats how i nose
well jup perhaps you are right
but to what fortunate circumstance am i
the gold-bug



to attribute the honor of a visit from
you to-day

  what de matter massa

 did you bring any message from
mr legrand

  no massa i bring his here pissle
and here jupiter handed me a note
which ran thus

 my dear - why have i not seen

you for so long a time i hope you have not
been so foolish as to take offence at any little
brusquerie of mine but no that is improbable

  since i saw you i have had great cause for
anxiety i have something to tell you yet
scarcely know how to tell it or whether i
should tell it at all

  i have not been quite well for some days
past and poor old jup annoys me almost be-
yond endurance by his well-meant attentions
would you believe it -he had prepared a huge
stick the other day with which to chastise
me for giving him the slip and spending the
day solus among the hills on the main land
i verily believe that my ill looks alone saved
me a flogging

  i have made no addition to my cabinet since
we met

  if you can in any way make it convenient
come over with jupiter do come i wish to
see you to-night upon business of importance
i assure you that it is of the highest importance

ever yours

william legrand

  there was something in the tone of
this note which gave me great un-
easiness its whole style differed mate-
rially from that of legrand what
could he be dreaming of what new
crochet possessed his excitable brain
what business of the highest impor-
tance could he possibly have to trans-
act jupiters account of him boded
no good i dreaded lest the continued
pressure of misfortune had at length
fairly unsettled the reason of my friend
without a moments hesitation there-
fore i prepared to accompany the negro

  upon reaching the wharf i noticed a
scythe and three spades all apparently
new lying in the bottom of the boat

in which we were to embark

  what is the meaning of all this
jup i inquired

  him syfe massa and spade

  very true but what are they doing
here

 him de syfe and de spade what
massa will sis pon my buying for him
in de town and de debbils own lot of
money i had to gib for em

  but what in the name of all that is
mysterious is your massa will going
to do with scythes and spades

  dats more dan i know and debbil
take me if i dont believe tis more dan
he know too but its all cum ob de
bug

  finding that no satisfaction was to be
obtained of jupiter whose whole intel-
lect seemed to be absorbed by de bug
i now stepped into the boat and made
sail with a fair and strong breeze we
soon ran into the little cove to the north-
ward of fort moultrie and a walk of
some two miles brought us to the hut
it was about three in the afternoon when
we arrived legrand had been awaiting
us in eager expectation he grasped my
hand with a nervous empressement
which alarmed me and strengthened the
suspicions already entertained his
countenance was pale even to ghastliness
and his deep-set eyes glared with un-
natural lustre after some inquiries re-
specting his health i asked him not
knowing what better to say if he had
yet obtained the scar aba us from lieu-
tenant g-

  oh yes he replied coloring vio-
lently i got it from him the next
morning nothing should tempt me to
part with that scarabceus do you know
that jupiter is quite right about it

  in what way i asked with a sad
foreboding at heart

  in supposing it to be a bug of real
gold he said this with an air of pro-


amazing stories

found seriousness and i felt inexpress-
ibly shocked

  this bug is to make my fortune
he continued with a triumphant smile
to reinstate me in my family posses-
sions is it any wonder then that i
prize it since fortune has thought fit
to bestow it upon me i have only to
use it properly and i shall arrive at the
gold of which it is the index jupiter
bring me that scarabceus j

  what de bug massa id rudder
not go fer trubble dat bug-you mus
git him for your own self hereupon
legrand arose with a grave and stately
air and brought me the beetle from a
glass case in which it was enclosed it
was a beautiful scarabceus and at that
time unknown to naturalists-of course
a great prize in a scientific point of view
there were two round black spots near
one extremity of the back and a long
one near the other the scales were
exceedingly hard and glossy with all the
appearance of burnished gold the
weight of the insect was very remark-
able and taking all things into con-
sideration i could hardly blame jupiter
for his opinion respecting it but what
to make of legrands agreement with
that opinion i could not for the life of
me tell

  i sent for you said he in a
grandiloquent tone when i had com-
pleted my examination of the beetle i
sent for you that i might have your
counsel and assistance in furthering the

views of fate and of the bug-

 my dear legrand i cried inter-
rupting him you are certainly unwell
and had better use some little precau-
tions you shall go to bed and i will
remain with you a few days until you
get over this you are feverish and-
feel my pulse said he

  i felt it and to say the truth found
not the slightest indication of fever
but you may be ill and yet have no

fever allow me this once to prescribe
for you in the first place go to bed

in the next-

  you are mistaken he interposed i
am as well as i can expect to be under
the excitement which i suffer if you
really wish me well you will relieve this
excitement

  and how is this to be done

  very easily jupiter and myself are
going upon an expedition into the hills
upon the main land and in this expedi-
tion we shall need the aid of some per-
son in whom we can confide you are
the only one we can trust whether we
succeed or fail the excitement which you
now perceive in me will be equally
allayed

  i am anxious to oblige you in any
way i replied but do you mean to
say that this infernal beetle has any con-
nection with your expedition into the
hills

  it has

  then legrand i can become a party
to no such absurd proceeding

  i am sorry-very sorry-for we shall
have to try it by ourselves

  try it by yourselves the man is
surely mad-but stay-how long do
you propose to be absent

  probably all night we shall start
immediately and be back at all events
by sunrise

  and will you promise me upon your
honor that when this freak of yours is
over and the bug business good god
settled to your satisfaction you will
then return home and follow my advice
implicity as that of your physician
yes i promise and now let us be
off for we have no time to lose

  with a heavy heart i accompanied
my friend we started about four
oclock-legrand jupiter the dog and
myself jupiter had with him the scythe
and spades-the whole of which he in-
sisted upon carrying-more through fear
the gold-bug



it seemed to me of trusting either of the
implements within reach of his master
than from any excess of industry or
complaisance his demeanor was dogged
in the extreme and dat d-d bug
were the sole words which escaped his
lips during the journey for my own
part i had charge of a couple of dark
lanterns while legrand contented him-
self with the scarabaus which he car-
ried attached to the end of a bit of whip-
cord twirling it to and fro with the
air of a conjuror as he went when i
observed this last plain evidence of my
friends aberration of mind i could
scarcely refrain from tears i thought it
best however to humor his fancy at
least for the present or until i could
adopt some more energetic measures
with a chance of success in the mean
time i endeavored but all in vain to
sound him in regard to the object of
the expedition having succeeded in
inducing me to accompany him he
seemed unwilling to hold conversation
upon any topic of minor importance and
to all my questions vouchsafed no other
reply than we shall see

  we crossed the creek at the head of
the island by means of a skiff and as-
cending the high grounds on the shore
of the main land proceeded in a north-
westerly direction through a tract of
country excessively wild and desolate
where no trace of a human footstep was
to be seen legrand led the way with
decision pausing only for an instant
here and there to consult what ap-
peared to be certain landmarks of his
own contrivance upon a former occasion

  in this manner we journeyed for
about two hours and the sun was just
setting when we entered a region in-
finitely more dreary than any yet seen
it was a species of table land near the
summit of an almost inaccessible hill
densely wooded from base to pinnacle
and interspersed with huge crags that

appeared to lie loosely upon the soil and
in many cases were prevented from pre-
cipitating themselves into the valleys
below merely by the support of the
trees against which they reclined deep
ravines in various directions gave an
air of still sterner solemnity to the
scene

  the natural platform to which we had
clambered was thickly overgrown with
brambles through which we soon dis-
covered that it would have been impos-
sible to force our way but for the
scythe and jupiter by direction of his
master proceeded to clear for us a path
to the foot of an enormously tall tulip-
tree which stood with some eight or
ten oaks upon the level and far sur-
passed them all and all other trees which
i had then seen in the beauty of its
foliage and form in the wide spread of
its branches and in the general majesty
of its appearance when we reached
this tree legrand turned to jupiter
and asked him if he thought he could
climb it the old man seemed a little
staggered by the question and for some
moments made no reply at length he
approached the huge trunk walked slow-
ly around it and examined it with
minute attention when he had com-
pleted his scrutiny he merely said

  yes massa jup climb any tree he
ebber see in he life

  then up with you as soon as pos-
sible for it will soon be too dark to
see what we are about

  how far mus go up massa in-
quired jupiter

  get up the main trunk first and then
i will tell you which way to go-and
here-stop take this beetle with you

  de bug massa will-de goole-
bug cried the negro drawing back in
dismay-what for mus tote de bug way
up de tree-d-n if i do

  if you are afraid jup a great big
negro like you to take hold of a harm-


amazing stories

less little dead beetle why you can carry
it up by this string-but if you do not
take it up with you in some way i shall
be under the necessity of breaking your
head with this shovel

  what de matter now massa said
jup evidently shamed into compliance
always want for to raise fuss wid old
nigger was only funnin any how me
feered de bug what i keer for de
bug here he took cautiously hold of
the extreme end of the string and
maintaining the insect as far from his
person as circumstances would permit
prepared to ascend the tree

  in youth the tulip-tree or lirioden-
dron tulipifermn the most magnificent
of american foresters has a trunk pe-
culiarly smooth and often rises to a
great height without lateral branches
but in its riper age the bark becomes
gnarled and uneven while many short
limbs make their appearance on the
stem thus the difficulty of ascension
in the present case lay more in sem-
blance than in reality embracing the
huge cylinder as closely as possible
with his arms and knees seizing with his
hands some projections and resting his
naked toes upon others jupiter after
one or two narrow escapes from falling
at length wriggled himself into the first
great fork and seemed to consider the
whole business as virtually accomplished
the risk of the achievement was in fact
now over although the climber was some
sixty or seventy feet from the ground

 which way mus go now massa
will he asked

  keep up the largest branch-the one
on this side said legrand the negro
obeyed him promptly and apparently
with but little trouble ascending high-
er and higher until no glimpse of his
squat figure could be obtained through
the dense foliage which enveloped it
presently his voice was heard in a sort
of halloo

  how much fudder is got to go
how high up are you asked le-
grand

  ebber so fur replied the negro
can see de sky frum de top ob de tree
never mind the sky but attend to
what i say look down the trunk and
count the limbs below you on this side
how many limbs have you passed
one two tree four fibe big limb
massa pon dis side

  then go one limb higher

  in a few minutes the voice was heard
again announcing that the seventh limb
was attained

  now jup cried legrand evidently
much excited i want you to work your
way out upon that limb as far as you
can if you see any thing strange let
me know

  by this time what little doubt i might
have entertained of my poor friends in-
sanity was put finally at rest i had
no alternative but to conclude him strick-
en with lunacy and i became seriously
anxious about getting him home while
i was pondering upon what was best to
be done jupiters voice was again heard

  mos feerd for to ventur pon dis
limb berry far-tis dead limb putty
much all de way

  did you say it was a dead limb jup-
iter cried legrand in a quavering
voice

  yes massa him dead as de door-nail
-done up for sartain-done departed
dis here life

  what in the name of heaven shall i
do asked legrand seemingly in the
greatest distress

  do said i glad of an opportunity
to interpose a word why come home
and go to bed come now-thats a
fine fellow its getting late and be-
sides you remember your promise

  jupiter cried he without heeding
me in the least do you hear me
the gold-bug



  yes massa will-hear you ebber so
plain

  try the wood well then with your
knife and see if you think it very rot-
ten

  him rotten massa sure nuff replied
the negro in a few moments but not so
berry rotten as mought be mought
venture out leetle way pon de limb by
myself dats true

by yourself-what do you mean
why i mean de bug tis berry
hebby bug spose i drop him down
fuss and den de limb wont break wid
just de weight ob one nigger

  you infernal scoundrel cried le-
grand apparently much relieved what
do you mean by telling me nonsense as
that as sure as you let that beetle
fall -ill break your neck look here
jupiter do you hear me

  yes massa neednt hollo at poor nig-
der dat style

  well now listen-if you will
venture out on the limb as far as you
think safe and not let go the beetle ill
make you a present of a silver dollar
as soon as you get down

  im gwine massa will-deed i is
replied the negro very promptly-mos
out to the eend now

  out to the end here fairly screamed
legrand do you say you are out to the
end of that limb

  soon to be de eend massa-o-o-o-o-

o-oh lor-gol-amarcy what is dis here
pon de tree

  well cried legrand highly de-
lighted what is it

  why taint noffin but a skull-some-
body bin lef him head up de tree and
de crows done gobble ebery bit ob de

meat off

  a skull you say-very well-how
is it fastened to the limb-what holds
it on

  sure nuff massa mus look why dis
berry curious sarcumstance pon my

word-dares a great big nail in de
skull what fastens ob it on to de tree
well now jupiter do exactly as i
tell you-do you hear

  yes massa

  pay attention then-find the left
eye of the skull

  hum hoo dats good why dar
aint no eye lef at all

  curse your stupidity do you know
your right hand from your left

  yes i nose dat-nose all bout dat-
tis my lef hand what i chops de wood
wid

  to be sure you are left-handed
and your left eye is on the same side
as your left hand now i suppose you
can find the left eye of the skull or the
place where the left eye has been have
you found it n

  here was a long pause at length the
negro asked

  is de lef eye on de skull pon de
same side as de lef hand of de skull
too-cause he skull aint got not a bit
ob a hand at all-nebber mind i got de
lef eye now-here the lef eye what mus
do wit it

  let the beetle drop dirough it as
far as the string will reach-but be
careful and not let go your hold of the
string

  all dat done massa will mighty
easy ting for to put de bug fru de hole
-look out for him dar below

  during this colloquy no portion of
jupiters person could be seen but the
beetle which he had suffered to descend
was now visible at the end of the string
and glistened like a globe of burnished
gold in the last rays of the setting sun
some of which still faintly illuminated
the eminence upon which we stood the
scarabceus hung quite clear of any
branches and if allowed to fall would
have fallen at our feet legrand imme-
diately took the scythe and cleared with
it a circular space three or four yards


amazing stories

in diameter just beneath the insect
and having accomplished this ordered
jupiter to let go the string and come
down from the tree

   driving a peg with great nicety into
the ground at the precise spot where the
beetle fell my friend now produced
from his pocket a tape-measure fasten-
ing one end of this at that point of the
trunk of the tree which was nearest the
peg he unrolled it till it reached the
peg and thence farther unrolled it in
the direction already established by the
two points of the tree and the peg for
a distance of fifty feet-jupiter clearing
away the brambles with the scythe at
the spot thus attained a second peg was
driven and about this as a centre a rude
circle about four feet in diameter de-
scribed taking now a spade himself
and giving one to jupiter and one to me
legrand begged us to set about digging
as quickly as possible

   to speak the truth i had no especial
relish for such amusement at any time
and at that particular moment would
most willingly have declined it for the
night was coming on and i felt much
fatigued with the exercise already taken
but i saw no mode of escape and was
fearful of disturbing my poor friends
equanimity by a refusal could i have
depended indeed upon jupiters aid i
would have had no hesitation in at-
tempting to get the lunatic home by
force but i was too well assured of
the old negros disposition to hope that
he would assist me under any circum-
stances in a personal contest with his
master i made no doubt that the lat-
ter had been infected with some of the
innumerable southern superstitions about
money buried and that his phantasy had
received confirmation by the finding of
the scarabceus or perhaps by jupiters
obstinacy in maintaining it to be a
bug of real gold a mind disposed to
lunacy would readily be led away by

such suggestions-especially if chiming

in with favorite preconceived ideas--
and then i called to mind the poor fel-
lows speech about the beetles being
the index of his fortune upon the
whole i was sadly vexed and puzzled
but at length i concluded to make a
virtue of necessity--to dig with a good
will and thus the sooner to convince the
visionary by ocular demonstration of
the fallacy of the opinions he enter-
tained

  the lanterns having been lit we all
fell to work with a zeal worthy a more
rational cause and as the glare fell
upon our persons and implements i
could not help thinking how picturesque
a group we composed and how strange
and superstitious our labors must have
appeared to any interloper who by
chance might have stumbled upon our
whereabouts

  we dug steadily for two hours little
was said and our chief embarrassment
lay in the yelpings of the dog who
took exceeding interest in our proceed-
ings he at length became so ob-
streperous that we grew fearful of his
giving the alarm to some stragglers in
the vicinity or rather this was the ap-
prehension of legrand for myself i
should have rejoiced at any interruption
which might have enabled me to get the
wanderer home the noise was at
length very effectively silenced by jup-
iter who getting out of the hole with
a dogged air of deliberation tied the
brutes mouth up with one of his sus-
penders and then returned with a
grave chuckle to his task

  when the time mentioned had ex-
pired we had reached a depth of five
feet and yet no signs of any treasure
became manifest a general pause en-
sued and i began to hope that the farce
was at an end legrand however al-
though evidently much disconcerted
wiped his brow thoughtfully and re-
the gold-bug



commenced we had excavated the en-
tire circle of four feet diameter and
now we slightly enlarged the limit and
went to the farther depth of two feet
still nothing appeared the gold-seek-
er whom i sincerely pitied at length
clambered from the pit with the bit-
terest disappointment imprinted upon
every feature and proceeded slowly and
reluctantly to put on his coat which he
had thrown off at the beginning of his
labor in the mean time i made no re-
mark jupiter at a signal from his
master began to gather up his tools
this done and the dog having been
unmuzzled we turned in profound
silence towards home

  we had taken perhaps a dozen steps
in this direction when with a loud oath
legrand strode up to jupiter and seized
him by the collar the astonished negro
opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest
extent let fall the spades and fell upon
his knees

  you scoundrel said legrand hiss-
ing out the syllables from between his
clenched teeth-you infernal black vil-
lain -speak i tell you-answer me
this instant without prevarication-
which-which is your left eye

  oh my golly massa will aint dis
here my lef eye for sartain roared the
terrified jupiter placing his hand upon his
right organ of vision and holding it
there with a desperate pertinacity as if
in immediate dread of his masters at-
tempt at a gouge

  i thought so-i knew it-hurrah
vociferated legrand letting the negro
go and executing a series of curvets and
caracols much to the astonishment of
his valet who arising from his knees
looked mutely from his master to my-
self and then from myself to his mas-
ter

  come we must go back said the
latter the games not up yet and he
again led the way to the tulip-tree

  jupiter said he when we reached
its foot come here was the skull nailed
to the limb with the face outwards or
with the face to the limb

  de face was out massa so dat de
crows could get at de eyes good witdout
any trouble

  well then was it this eye or that
through which you let the beetle fall
-here legrand touched each of jupi-
ters eyes

  twas dis eye massa-de lef eye-jis
as you told me and here it was his right
eye that the negro indicated

  that will do-we must try again
here my friend about whose madness
i now saw or fancied that i saw cer-
tain indications of method removed the
peg which marked the spot where the
beetle fell to a spot about three inches
to the westward of its former position
taking now the tape-measure from the
nearest point of the trunk to the peg
as before and continuing the extension in
a straight line to the distance of fifty
feet a spot was indicated removed by
several yards from the point at which we
had been digging

  around the new position a circle
somewhat larger than in the former in-
stance was now described and we again
set to work with the spades i was
dreadfully weary but scarcely under-
standing what had occasioned the change
in my thoughts i felt no longer any
great aversion from the labor imposed
i had become most unaccountedly inter-
ested-nay even excited perhaps there
was something amid all the extravagant
demeanor of legrand-some air of fore-
thought or of deliberation which im-
pressed me i dug eagerly and now and
then caught myself actually looking with
something that very much resembled ex-
pectation for the fancied treasure the
vision of which had demented my unfor-
tunate companion at a period when
such vagaries of thought most fully

possessed me and when we had been at
work perhaps an hour and a half we
were again interrupted by the violent
howlings of the dog his uneasiness in
the first instance had been evidently
but the result of playfulness or caprice
but he now assumed a bitter and serious
tone upon jupiters again attempting
to muzzle him he made furious resis-
tance and leaping into the hole tore up
the mould frantically with his claws in
a few seconds he had uncovered a mass of
human bones forming two complete
skeletons intermingled with several but-
tons of metal and what appeared to be
the dust of decayed woollen one or two
strokes of a spade upturned the blade of
a large spanish knife and as we dug
farther three or four loose pieces of gold
and silver coin came to light

  at sight of these the joy of jupiter
could scarcely be restrained but the
countenance of his master wore an air of
extreme disappointment he urged us
however to continue our exertions and
the words were hardly uttered when i
stumbled and fell forward having
caught the toe of my boot in a large ring
of iron that lay half buried in the loose
earth

  we now worked in earnest and never
did i pass ten minutes of more intense
excitement during this interval we had
fairly unearthed an oblong chest of wood
which from its perfect preservation and
wonderful hardness had plainly been
subjected to some mineralizing process
-perhaps that of the bichloride of mer-
cury this box was three and a half feet
long three feet broad and two and a
half feet deep it was firmly secured by
bands of wrought iron riveted and
forming a kind of trellis-work over the
whole on each side of the chest near
the top were three rings of iron-six in
all-by means of which a firm hold could
be obtained by six persons our utmost
united endeavors served only to disturb

the coffer very slightly in its bed we at
once saw the impossibility of removing
so great a weight luckily the sole fast-
enings of the lid consisted of two sliding
bolts these we drew back-trembling
and panting with anxiety in an instant
a treasure of incalculable value lay
gleaming before us as the rays of the
lanterns fell within the pit there flashed
upwards from a confused heap of gold
and of jewels a glow and a glare that
absolutely dazzled our eyes

  i shall not pretend to describe the
feelings with which i gazed amazement
was of course predominant legrand
appeared exhausted with excitement and
spoke very few words jupiters counte-
nance wore for some minutes as deadly
a pallor as it is possible in the nature of
things for any negros visage to as-
sume he seemed stupefied-thunder-
stricken presently he fell upon his
knees in the pit and burying his naked
arms up to the elbows in gold let them
there remain as if enjoying the luxury of
a bath at length with a deep sigh he
exclaimed as if in a soliloquy

  and dis all cum ob de goole-bug de
putty goole-bug de poor little goole-bug
what i boosed in dat sabage kind ob
style aint you shamed ob yourself
nigger-answer me dat

  it became necessary at last that i
should arouse both master and valet to
the expediency of removing the treasure
it was growing late and it behooved us
to make exertion that we might get
every thing housed before daylight it
was difficult to say what should be done
and much time was spent in deliberation
-so confused were the ideas of all we
finally lightened the box by removing
two thirds of its contents when we were
enabled with some trouble to raise it
from the hole the articles taken out
were deposited among the brambles and
the dog left to guard them with strict
orders from jupiter neither upon any

pretence to stir from the spot nor to
open his mouth until our return we then
hurriedly made for home with the chest
reaching the hut in safety but after ex-
cessive toil at one oclock in the morn-
ing worn out as we were it was not in
human nature to do more just then we
rested until two and had supper start-
ing for the hills immediately afterwards
armed with three stout sacks which by
good luck were upon the premises a
little before four we arrived at the pit
divided the remainder of the booty as
equally as might be among us and leav-
ing the holes unfilled again set out for the
hut at which for the second time we
deposited our golden burthens just as
the first streaks of the dawn gleamed
over the tree-tops in the east

  we were now thoroughly broken
down but in the intense excitement of
the time denied us repose after an
unquiet slumber of some three or four
hours duration we arose as if by pre-
concert to make examination of our
treasure

  the chest had been full to the brim
and we spent the whole day and the
greater part of the next night in a scru-
tiny of its contents there had been
nothing like order or arrangement every
thing had been heaped in promiscuously
having assorted all with care we found
ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth
than we had at first supposed in coin
there was rather more than four hundred
and fifty thousand dollars-estimating the
value of the pieces as accurately at we
could by the tables of the period there
was not a particle of silver all was gold
of antique date and of great variety-
french spanish and german money
with a few english guineas and some
counters of which we had never seen
specimens before there were several
large and heavy coins so worn that
we could make nothing of their inscrip-
tions there was no american money

the value of the jewels we found more

difficulty in estimating there were dia-
monds-some of them exceedingly large
and fine-a hundred and ten in all and
not one of them small eighteen rubies of
remarkable brilliancy three hundred and
ten emeralds all very beautiful and
twenty-one sapphires with an opal these
stones had all been broken from their set-
tings and thrown loose in the chest the
settings themselves which we picked out
from among the other gold appeared to
have been beaten up with hammers as if
to prevent identification besides all this
there was a vast quantity of solid gold
ornaments nearly two hundred massive
finger and ear rings rich chains-thirty
of these if i remember eighty-three very
large and heavy crucifixes five gold cen-
sers of great value a prodigious golden
punch-bowl ornamented with richly
chased vine-leaves and bacchanalian fig-
ures  with two sword-handles exquis-
itely embossed and many other smaller
articles which i cannot recollect the
weight of these valuables exceeded three
hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois
and in this estimate i have not included
one hundred and ninety-seven superb
gold watches three of the number be-
ing worth five hundred dollars if one
many of them were very old and as time-
keepers valueless the works having suf-
fered more or less from corrosion-
but all were richly jewelled and in cases
of great worth we estimated the en-
tire contents of the chest that night at
a million and a half of dollars and upon
the subsequent disposal of the trinkets
and jewels a few being retained for our
own use it was found that we had
greatly undervalued the treasure

  when at length we had concluded
our examination and the intense ex-
citement of the time had in some meas-
ure subsided legrand who saw that i
was dying with impatience for a solution
of this most extraordinary riddle entered


amazing stories

into a full detail of all the circumstances
connected with it

   you remember said he the night
when i handed you the rough sketch i had
made of the scarabceus you recollect
also that i became quite vexed at you
for insisting that my drawing resembled
a deaths-head when you first made this
assertion i thought you were jesting but
afterwards i called to mind the peculiar
spots on the back of the insect and ad-
mitted to myself that your remark had
some little foundation in fact still the
sneer at my graphic powers irritated me
-for i am considered a good artist-
and therefore when you handed me the
scrap of parchment i was about to
crumple it up and throw it angrily into
the fire

   the scrap of paper you mean said

i

  no it had much of the appearance
of paper and at first i supposed it
to be such but when i came to draw
upon it i discovered it at once to be
a piece of very thin parchment it was
quite dirty you remember well as
i was in the very act of crumpling it up
my glance fell upon the sketch at which
you had been looking and you may
imagine my astonishment when i per-
ceived in fact the figure of a deaths-
head just where it seemed to me i
had made the drawing of the beetle
for a moment i was too much amazed
to think with accuracy i knew that
my design was very different in detail
from this-although there was a certain
similarity in general outline presently
i took a candle and seating myself at the
other end of the room proceeded to
scrutinize the parchment more closely
upon turning it over i saw my own
sketch upon the reverse just as i had
made it my first idea now was mere
surprise at the really remarkable sim-
ilarity of outline-at the singular co-
incidence involved in the fact that un-

known to me there should have been a
skull upon the other side of the parch-
ment immediately beneath my figure of
the scarabceus and that this skull not
only in outline but in size should so
closely resemble my drawing i say the
singularity of this coincidence abso-
lutely stupefied me for a time this
is the usual effect of such coincidences
the mind struggles to establish a con-
nexion-a sequence of cause and effect
-and being unable to do so suffers a
species of temporary paralysis but
when i recovered from this stupor there
dawned upon me gradually a conviction
which startled me even far more than
the coincidence i began distinctly pos-
itively to remember that there had
been no drawing on the parchment when
i made my sketch of the scarabceus i
became perfectly certain of this for i
recollected turning up first one side and
then the other in search of the clean-
est spot had the skull been there of
course i could not have failed to notice
it here was indeed a mystery which i
felt it impossible to explain but even
at that early moment there seemed to
glimmer faithfully within the most re-
mote and secret chambers of my intel-
lect a glow-worm-like conception of
that truth which last nights adventure
brought to so magnificent a demonstra-
tion i arose at once and putting the
parchment securely away dismissed all
farther reflection until i should be alone

  when you had gone and when jupi-
ter was fast asleep i betook myself to
a more methodical investigation of the
affair in the first place i considered
the manner in which the parchment had
come into my possession the spot
where we discovered the scarabceus was
on the coast of the main land about a
mile eastward of the island and but a
short distance above high water mark
upon my taking hold of it it gave me
a sharp bite which caused me to let
the gold-bug



it drop jupiter with his accustomed
caution before seizing the insect
which had flown towards him looked
about him for a leaf or something of
that nature by which to take hold of it
it was at this moment that his eyes
and mine also fell upon the scrap of
parchment which i then supposed to be
paper it was lying half buried in the
sand a corner sticking up near the
spot where we found it i observed the
remnants of the hull of what appeared
to have been a ships long boat the
wreck seemed to have been there for a
very great while for the resemblance to
boat timbers could scarcely be traced

  well jupiter picked up the parch-
ment wrapped the beetle in it and gave
it to me soon afterwards we turned to
go home and on the way met lieutenant

g- i showed him the insect and he

begged me to let him take it to the fort
on my consenting he thrust it forthwith
into his waistcoat pocket without the
parchment in which it had been wrapped
and which i had continued to hold in
my hand during his inspection per-
haps he dreaded my changing my mind
and thought it best to make sure of the
prize at once-you know how enthu-
siastic he is on all subjects connected
with natural history at the same
time without being conscious of it i
must have deposited the parchment in
my own pocket

  you remember that when i went to
the table for the purpose of making a
sketch of the beetle i found no paper
where it was usually kept i looked in
the drawer and found none there i
searched my pockets hoping to find an
old letter-and then my hand fell upon
the parchment i thus detail the pre-
cise mode in which it came into my
possession for the circumstances im-
pressed me with peculiar force

  no doubt you will think me fanciful
-but i had already established a kind of

connexion i had put together two links
of a great chain there was a boat ly-
ing on a sea-coast and not far from the
boat was a parchment-not a paper-
with a skull depicted on it you will of
course ask where is the connexion i
reply that the skull or deaths head is
the well-known emblem of the pirate
the flag of the deaths-head is hoisted
in all engagements

  i have said that the scrap was parch-
ment and not paper parchment is
durable-almost imperishable matters
of little moment are rarely consigned to
parchment since for the mere ordinary
purposes of drawing or writing it is not
nearly so well adapted as paper this
reflection suggested some meaning-
some relevancy-in the deaths-head i
did not fail to observe also the form of
the parchment although one of its
corners had been by some accident de-
stroyed it could be seen that the original
form was oblong it was just such a
slip indeed as might have been chosen
for a memorandum-for a record of
something to be long remembered and
carefully preserved

  but i interposed you say that
the skull was not upon the parch-
ment when you made the drawing of
the beetle how then do you trace
any connexion between the boat and
the skull-since this latter according to
your own admission must have been
designed god only knows how or by
whom at some period subsequent to
your sketching the scarab a us

  ah hereupon turns the whole mys-
tery although the secret at this point i
had comparatively little difficulty in solv-
ing my steps were sure and could
afford but a single result i reasoned
for example thus when i drew the
scarabcews there was no skull apparent
on the parchment when i had com-
pleted the drawing i gave it to you
and observed you narrowly until you re-


amazing stories

turned it you therefore did not de-
sign the skull and no one else was
present to do it then it was not done
by human agency and nevertheless
it was done

  at this stage of my reflections i en-
deavored to remember and did remem-
ber with entire distinctness every in-
cident which occurred about the period
in question the weather was chilly
oh rare and happy accident and a
fire was blazing on the hearth i was
heated with exercise and sat near the
table you however had drawn a chair
close to the chimney just as i placed
the parchment in your hand and as
you were in the act of inspecting it
wolf the newfoundland entered and
leaped upon your shoulders with your
left hand you caressed him and kept
him off while your right holding the
parchment was permitted to fall list-
lessly between your knees and in close
proximity to the fire at one moment i
thought the blaze had caught it and was
about to caution you but before i could
speak you had withdrawn it and were
re-engaged in its examination when
i considered all these particulars i
doubted not for a moment that heat had
been the agent in bringing to light on
the parchment the skull which i saw
designed on it you are well aware that
chemical preparations exist and have
existed time out of mind by means of
which it is possible to write on either
paper or vellum so that the characters
shall become visible only when subjected
to the action of fire zaffre digested
in aqua regia and diluted with four
times its weight of water is sometimes
employed a green tint results the reg-
ulus of cobalt dissolved in spirit of nitre
gives a red these colors disappear at
longer or shorter intervals after the
material written cools but again become
apparent upon the re-application of heat

  i now scrutinized the deaths head

with care its outer edges-the edges
of the drawing nearest the edge of the
vellum-were far more distinct than the
others it was clear that the action of
the caloric had been imperfect or un-
equal i immediately kindled a fire and
subjected every portion of the parch-
ment to a glowing heat at first the
only effect was the strengthening of the
faint lines in the skull but on perse-
vering in the experiment there became
visible at the corner of the slip diagon-
ally opposite to the spot in which the
deaths-head was delineated the figure
of what i at first supposed to be a goat
a closer scrutiny however satisfied me
that it was intended for a kid

  ha ha said i to be sure i have no
right to laugh at you-a million and a
half of money is too serious a matter for
mirth-but you are not about to estab-
lish a third link in your chain-you will
not find any especial connexion be-
tween your pirates and a goat-pirates
you know have nothing to do with
goats they appertain to the farming
interest

  but i have just said that the figure
was not that of a goat

  well a kid then-pretty much the
same thing

  pretty much but not altogether
said legrand you may have heard of
one captain kidd i at once looked on
the figure of the animal as a kind
of punning or hieroglyphical signature
i say signature because its position on
the vellum suggested this idea the
deaths head at the corner diagonally op-
posite had in the same manner the air
of a stamp or seal but i was sorely
put out by the absence of all else-of
the body to my imagined instrument-
of the text for my context

  i presume you expected to find a let-
ter between the stamp and the signa-
ture

  something of that kind the fact is
the gold-bug



i felt irresistibly impressed with a pre-
sentiment of some vast good fortune im-
pending i can scarcely say why
perhaps after all it was rather a desire
than an actual belief-but do you know
that jupiters silly words about the bug
being of solid gold had a remarkable
effect on my fancy and then the
series of accidents and coincidences
-these were so very extraordinary do
you- observe how mere an accident it
was that these events should have oc-
curred on the sole day of all the year in
which it has been or may be suffi-
ciently cool for fire and that without the
fire or without the intervention of the
dog at the precise moment in which he
appeared i should never have become
aware of the deaths-head and so never
the possessor of the treasure

  but proceed-i am all impatience
well you have heard of course the
many stories current-the thousand
vague rumors afloat about money
buried somewhere on the atlantic coast
by kidd and his associates these rum-
ors must have had some foundation in
fact and that the rumors have existed
so long and so continuously could have
resulted it appears to me only from the
circumstance of the buried treasure still
remaining entombed had kidd con-
cealed his plunder for a time and after-
wards reclaimed it the rumors would
scarcely have reached us in their present
unvarying form you will observe that
the stories told are all about money-
seekers not about money-finders had
the pirate recovered his money there the
affair would have dropped it seemed
to me that some accident-say the loss
of a memorandum indicating its local-
ity-had deprived him of the means of
recovering it and that this accident had
become known to his followers who
otherwise might never have heard that
treasure had been concealed at all and
who busying themselves in vain be-

cause unguided attempts to regain it
had given first birth and then universal
currency to the reports which are now
so common have you ever heard of
any important treasure being unearthed
along the coast

  never

  but that kidds accumulations were
immense is well known i took it for
granted therefore that the earth still
held them and you will scarcely be sur-
prised when i tell you that i felt a hope
nearly amounting to certainty that the
parchment so strangely found involved
a lost record of the place of deposit

  but how did you proceed

   i held the vellum again to the fire
after increasing the heat but nothing
appeared i now thought it possible that
the coating of dirt might have something
to do with the failure so i carefully
rinsed the parchment by pouring warm
water over it and having done this i
placed it in a tin pan with the skull
downwards and put the pan upon a
furnace of lighted charcoal in a few
minutes the pan having become thor-
oughly heated i removed the slip and
to my inexpressible joy found it spotted
in several places with what appeared to
be figures arranged in lines again
i placed it in the pan and suffered it
to remain another minute on taking it
off the whole was just as you see it
now

  here legrand having re-heated the
parchment submitted it to my inspec-
tion the following characters were
rudely traced in a red tint between the
deaths-head and the goat

amazing stories

   but said i returning him the slip
i am as much in the dark as ever
were all the jewels of golconda await-
ing me on my solution of this enigma
i am quite sure that i should be unable
to earn them

  and yet said legrand the solu-
tion is by no means so difficult as you
might be led to imagine from the first
hasty inspection of the characters these
characters as any one might readily
guess form a cipher-that is to say
they convey a meaning but then from
what is known of kidd i could not
suppose him capable of constructing
any of the more abstruse cryptographs
i made up my mind at once that this
was of a simple species-such however
as would appear to the crude intellect
of the sailor absolutely insoluble with-
out the key

  and you really solved it

  readily i have solved others of an
abstruseness ten thousand times greater
circumstances and a certain bias of
mind have led me to take interest in
such riddles and it may well be doubted
whether human ingenuity can construct
an enigma of the kind which human in-
genuity may not by proper application
resolve in fact having once established
connected and legible characters i
scarcely gave a thought to the mere
difficulty of developing their import

  in the present case-indeed in all
cases of secret writing-the first ques-
tion regards the language of the cipher
for the principles of solution so far
especially as the more simple ciphers
are concerned depend on and are varied
by the genius of the particular idiom
in general there is no alternative but
experiment directed by probabilities
of every tongue known to him who
attempts the solution until the true one
be attained but with the cipher now
before us all difficulty is removed by

the signature the pun on the word
kidd is appreciable in no other lan-
guage than the english but for this
consideration i should have begun my
attempts with the spanish and french
as the tongues in which a secret of this
kind would most naturally have been
written by a pirate of the spanish main
as it was i assumed the cryptograph
to be english

  you observe there are no divisions
between the words had there been divi-
sions the task would have been com-
paratively easy in such case i should
have commenced with a collation and
analysis of the shorter words and had
a word of a single letter occurred as
is most likely a or  for example i
should have considered the solution as
assured but there being no division
my first step was to ascertain the pre-
dominant letters as well as the least
frequent counting all i constructed
a table thus

of the character  there are 

   tt  
   a   
  st  
   tt  
   it  
   tt  
f  tt   
   tt   
  a    
  tt   
   a    
 h  a    
-  a      
  now in english the letter which
most frequently occurs is e after-
wards the succession runs thus a o i d
hnrstuycfgl m w b k p q x z
e however predominates so remarkably
that an individual sentence of any length
is rarely seen in which it is not the
prevailing character
the gold-bug



  here then we have in the very
beginning the groundwork for some-
thing more than a mere guess the
general use which may be made of the
table is obvious-but in this particular
cipher we shall only very partially re-
quire its aid as our predominant
character is  we will commence by
assuming it as the e of the natural
alphabet to verify the supposition let
us observe if the  be seen often in
couples-for e is doubled with great
frequency in english-in such words
for example as meet fleet speed
seen been agree etc in the pres-
ent instance we see it doubled no less
than five times although the crypto-
graph is brief

  let us assume  then as e now
of all words in the language the is
most usual let us see therefore whether
there are not repetitions of any three
characters in the same order of col-
location the last of them being  if
we discover repetitions of such letters
so arranged they will most probably
represent the word the on inspection
we find no less than seven such arrange-
ments the characters being  we
may therefore assume that the semi-
colon represents t that  represents h
and that  represents e-the last being
now well confirmed thus a great step
has been taken

   but having established a single word
we are enabled to establish a vastly im-
portant point that is to say several
commencements and terminations of
other words let us refer for example
to the last instance but one in which
the combination  occurs-not far
from the end of the cipher we know
that the semicolon immediately ensuing
is the commencement of a word and
of the six characters succeeding this
the we are cognizant of no less than
five let us set these characters down
thus by the letters we know them to

represent leaving a space for the un-
known-

t eeth

  here we are enabled at once to
discard the th as forming no portion
of the word commencing with the first
t since by experiment of the entire
alphabet for a letter adapted to the
vacancy we perceived that no word can
be formed of which this th can be a
part we are thus narrowed into

t ee

and going through the alphabet if
necessary as before we arrive at the
word tree as the sole possible reading
we thus gain another letter r repre-
sented by  with the words the tree
in juxtaposition

  looking beyond these words for a
short distance we again see the com-
bination  and employ it by way of
termination to what immediately pre-
cedes we have thus this arrangement

         the tree  the
or substituting the natural letters where
known it reads thus

          the tree thrh the

  now if in place of the unknown
characters we leave blank spaces or
substitute dots we read thus

          the tree thr  h the

when the word through makes itself
evident at once but this discovery
gives us three new letters o u and g
represented by   and 

  looking now narrowly through the
cipher for combinations of known char-
acters we find not very far from the
beginning this arrangement

 or egree


amazing stories

which plainly is the conclusion of the
word degree and gives us another
letter d represented by f-

  four letters beyond the word de-
gree we perceive the combination

 

  translating the known characters
and representing the unknown by dots
we read thus

an arrangement immediately suggestive
of the word thirteen and again fur-
nishing us with two new characters i

  referring now to the beginning of
the cryptograph we find the combina-
tion

translating as before we obtain

a and that the first two words are
a good

  to avoid confusion it is now time
that we arrange our key as far as dis-
covered in a tabular form it will stand
thus

 represents a

   we have therefore no less than ten
of the most important letters repre-

sented and it will be unnecessary to
proceed with the details of the solution
i have said enough to convince you that
ciphers of this nature are readily sol-
uble and to give you some insight into
the rationale of their development but
be assured that the specimen before us
appertains to the very simplest species
of cryptograph it now only remains
to give you the full translation of the
characters upon the parchment as un-
riddled here it is

  a good glass in the bishops hostel
in the devils seat twenty-one degrees
and thirteen minutes northeast and by
north main branch seventh limb east side
shoot from the left eye of the deaths-
head a bee line from the tree through
the shot fifty feet out

  but said i this enigma seems still
in as bad a condition as ever how is
it possible to extort a meaning from all
this jargon about devils seats deaths-
heads and bishops hotels

  i confess replied legrand that
the matter still wears a serious aspect
when regarded with a casual glance my
first endeavour was to divide the sen-
tence into the natural division intended
by the cryptographist

  you mean to punctuate it
  something of that kind

  but how was it possible to effect
this

  i reflected that it had been a point
with the writer to run his words to-
gether without division so as to increase
the difficulty of solution now a not
over-acute man in pursuing such
an object would be nearly certain to
overdo the matter when in the course
of his composition he arrived at a break
in his subject which would naturally re-
quire a pause or a point he would be
exceedingly apt to run his characters
at this place more than usually close
the gold-bug



together if you will observe the ms
in the present instance you will easily
detect five such cases of unusual crowd-
ing acting on this hint i made the
division thus

  a good glass in the bishops hostel
in the devils seat-twenty-one degrees
and thirteen minutes-northeast and by
north-main branch seventh limb east
side-shoot from the left eye of the
deaths-head-a bee-line from the tree
through the shot fifty feet out

  even this division said i leaves
me still in the dark

  it left me also in the dark replied
legrand for a few days during which
i made diligent inquiry in the neigh-
bourhood of sullivans island for any
building which went by the name of
the bishops hotel for of course i
dropped the obsolete word hostel gain-
ing no information on the subject i
was on the point of extending my sphere
of search and proceeding in a more
systematic manner when one morning
it entered into my head quite suddenly
that this bishops hostel might have
some reference to an old family of the
name of bessop which time out of
mind had held possession of an ancient
manor-house about four miles to the
northward of the island i accordingly
went over to the plantation and re-
instituted my inquiries among the older
negroes of the place at length one of
the most aged of the women said that
she had heard of such a place as bes-
sops castle and thought that she could
guide me to it but that it was not a
castle nor a tavern but a high rock

  i offered to pay her well for her
trouble and after some demur she
consented to accompany me to the spot
we found it without much difficulty
when dismissing her i proceeded to
examine the place the castle con-

sisted of an irregular assemblage of
cliffs and rocks-one of the latter being
quite remarkable for its height as well
as for its insulated and artificial appear-
ance i clambered to its apex and then
felt much at a loss as to what should be
next done

  while i was busied in reflection my
eyes fell upon a narrow ledge in the
eastern face of the rock perhaps a yard
below the summit on which i stood
this ledge projected about eighteen
inches and was not more than a foot
wide while a niche in the cliff just above
it gave it a rude resemblance to one
of the hollow-backed chairs used by our
ancestors i made no doubt that here
was the devils seat alluded to in the
ms and now i seemed to grasp the
full secret of the riddle

  the good glass i knew could have
reference to nothing but a telescope
for the word glass is rarely employed
in any other sense by seamen now
here i at once saw was a telescope to
be used and a definite point of view
admitting no variation from which to
use it nor did i hesitate to believe
that the phrases twenty-one degrees
and thirteen minutes and northeast and
by north were intended as directions
for the levelling of the glass greatly
excited by these discoveries i hurried
home procured a telescope and returned
to the rock

  i let myself down to the ledge and
found that it was impossible to retain a
seat on it unless in one particular posi-
tion this fact confirmed by precon-
ceived idea i proceeded to use the
glass of course the twenty-one de-
grees and thirteen minutes could allude
to nothing but elevation above the visible
horizon since the horizontal direction
was clearly indicated by the words
northeast and by north this latter
direction i at once established by means
of a pocket-compass then pointing the


amazing stories

glass as nearly at an angle of twenty-
one degrees of elevation as i could do
it by guess i moved it cautiously up
or down until my attention was arrested
by a circular rift or opening in the
foliage of a large tree that overtopped
its fellows in the distance in the cen-
tre of this rift i perceived a white spot
but could not at first distinguish what
it was adjusting the focus of the tele-
scope i again looked and now made it
out to be a human skull

  on this discovery i was so sanguine
as to consider the enigma solved for
the phrase main branch seventh limb
east side could refer only to the posi-
tion of the skull on the tree while shoot
from the left eye of the deaths-head
admitted also of but one interpretation
in regard to a search for buried treasure
i perceived that the design was to drop
a bullet from the left eye of the skull
and that a bee-line or in other words
a straight line drawn from the near-
est point of the trunk through the shot
or the spot where the bullet fell and
thence extended to a distance of fifty
feet would indicate a definite point-
and beneath this point i thought it at
least possible that a deposit of value lay
concealed

  all this i said is exceedingly
clear and although ingenious still sim-
ple and explicit when you left the
bishops hotel what then

  why having carefully taken the
bearings of the tree i turned home-
wards the instant that i left the
devils seat however the circular rift
vanished nor could i get a glimpse of
it afterwards turn as i would what
seems to me the chief ingenuity in this
whole business is the fact for repeated
experiment has convinced me it is a
fact that the circular opening in ques-
tion is visible from no other attainable
point of view than that afforded by the
narrow ledge on the face of the rock

  in this expedition to the bishops
hotel i had been attended by jupiter
who had no doubt observed for some
weeks past the abstraction of my de-
meanour and took especial care not to
leave me alone but on the next day
getting up very early i contrived to
give him the slip and went into the
hills in search of the tree after much
toil i found it when i came home
at night my valet proposed to give me
a flogging with the rest of the adven-
ture i believe you are as well acquainted
as myself

  i suppose said i you missed the
spot in the first attempt at digging
through jupiters stupidity in letting the
bug fall through the right instead of
through the left eye of the skull

  precisely this mistake made a dif-
ference of about two inches and a half
in the shot-that is to say in the posi-
tion of the peg nearest the tree and had
the treasure been beneath the shot the
error would have been of little moment
but the shot together with the nearest
point of the tree were merely two points
for the establishment of a line of direc-
tion  of course the error however
trivial in the beginning increased as we
proceeded with the line and by the time
we had gone fifty feet threw us quite
off the scent but for my deep-seated
convictions that treasure was here some-
where actually buried we might have
had all our labour in vain

  i presume the fancy of the skull
of letting fall a bullet through the skulls
eye-was suggested to kidd by the
piratical flag no doubt he felt a kind
of poetical consistency in recovering his
money through this ominous insignum
perhaps so still i cannot help think-
ing that common-sense had quite as
much to do with the matter as poetical
consistency to be visible from the
devils seat it was necessary that the
object if small should be white and
the gold-bug



there is nothing like your human skull
for retaining and even increasing its
whiteness under exposure to all vicissi-
tudes of weather

  but your grandiloquence and your
conduct in swinging the beetle-how
excessively odd i was sure you were
mad and why did you insist on letting
fall the bug instead of a bullet from
the skull

  why to be frank i felt somewhat
annoyed by your evident suspicions
touching my sanity and so resolved to
punish you quietly in my own way by
a little bit of sober mystification for
this reason i swung the beetle and for
this reason i let it fall from the tree
an observation of yours about its great
weight suggested the latter idea

  yes i perceive and now there is

only one point which puzzles me what
are we to make of the skeletons found
in the hole

  that is a question i am no more
able to answer than yourself there
seems however only one plausible way
of accounting for them-and yet it is
dreadful to believe in such atrocity as
my suggestion would imply it is clear
that kidd-if kidd indeed secreted this
treasure which i doubt not-it is clear
that he must have had assistance in the
labour but the worst of this labour
concluded he may have thought it ex-
pedient to remove all participants in
his secret perhaps a couple of blows
with a mattock were sufficient while
his coadjutors were busy in the pit
perhaps it required a dozen-who shall
tell

of pseudo-science yet through the story alone the
average person is able to familiarize himself with science
it requires exaggeration to secure his attentionl more-

a letter from a young australian reader
who seem to like amazing stories
editor amazing stories 

  a letter for the discussions columns of
course it may not be printed but i do enjoy
writing to my favorite magazine and i sup-
pose the editor likes to hear from his readers
overseas

  i have quite an immense pile of amazing
stories magazines now and i store them
away with such miserly care that people think
im a little mad it is a silly habit this sav-
ing of countless magazines but i just cant
bring myself to part with my copies

  its strange how the passing of years broad-
ens the mind some time ago  wrote you
two letters i have just looked them up and
i find that they are senseless conglomerations
of voluble and denunciatory criticism amaz-
ing constructions of warped personal opinions
now with the passing of only twenty-four
months i have learned the meaning of under-
standing and tolerance and from the superior
eminence of aged seventeen i can look back
with supercilious horror and disgust at my for-
mer harsh juvenile criticisms

  the thing of most importance that i have to
say about your magazine is that it is steadily
and unceasingly improving i mean this sin-
cerely for a study of amazing stories re-
veals the following

  the covers are now amazing without being
extravagant the binding has become more
staple more solid in all ways the stories are
being selected with taste and care the ad-
vertising space has been cut down in accord-
ance with a growing circulation at least i
assume that the circulation is growing is it

  for  i chose as best these stories

  best serial-the swordsman of sarvon

for its sustained action originality and con-
cise style

  best novelette-the cities of ardathia

because it is an attempt-and a not unsuccess-
ful one-at better class sciencefiction i would
like to see more from mr flagg

  best short story-the man who lived

twice this was scientific and there were
big possibilities in it

   started well and i know it will continue
thus the april issue was especially good
now that a hyatt verrill has come back i
suggest with all humility that his work would
be far more interesting if he condensed each

story to half the length to which he usually
carries it

  i like dr kellers work well enough but in
his striving after simplicity of narrative it
seems to me that he borders on the affectation
that it would appear he is so anxious to avoid

  i noticed something queer in the september
 issue the science questionnaire asks
how many feet of lead cosmic rays will pene-
trate in the story the lady of light the
answer is given as eight feet and yet on
page  of the same issue another author
tells us that the rays will pass through seven-
teen feet of lead why this contradiction
it would seem to suggest that the scientific
facts in your tales are not as scrupulously
verified as you would have us believe please
clear up the point for me

  a belated word on the remarkable innova-
tion that saw the light of day on the cover
of the january  number this is distinctly
superior to any cover that i have seen prior to
it certainly it came as a shock-an extraord-
inary shock-to find it on your so reserved and
aloof a magazine and a one-color cover at first
savored of meanness to me but after a study
of it i decided that i vastly prefer it to some
of the hideous pictures that have leered at me
from your front page in the past this cover
and the altered arrangement of the letters
amazing stories reveal that you are not
afraid to get away from your former dispas-
sionate attitude toward all forms of innovation
morey still cant draw a human face with any
degree of fidelity and in spite of what may be
said against impressionism i definitely prefer
it to bad sketching

  incidentally why did you refuse to give us
more of muller actual count of letters pub-
lished in your columns reveals that he was
favored by the majority after all his work
was merely modern it did not go as far as
impressionism

  but enough of impressionism cubism and
all other kinds of unorthodox art well leave
discussion of them to their vehement neophytes

  to end this letter i would like to tell your
readers that im very anxious to read the single
amazing stories annual that was published
and also the story the moon pool and i
would like to hear from anyone who has these
magazines to sell or exchange

  we always get pleasant letters from the
antipodes although we do not always have to go
ten or twelve thousand miles to get a pleasant
appreciation of our efforts in giving the best
stories or what the writer considers such in-
terest is added by the little criticism following
each one of them a reason for the faith that
is in him we do not know what mr verrill
will think when he reads your criticism of his
methods we are going to give some of his
work in a number of our issues in the near
future starting with the june issue as far as
the penetration of lead by cosmic rays is con-
cerned it varies greatly according to the local-
ity and many statements of the penetrating
power have been given by compton millikan
and others this will clear up your points of
criticism as far as innovation is concerned

a tribute to dr e e smith from a
canadian admirer

editor amazing stories

  my first copy of scientifiction i picked up
three years ago and i was so thrilled with that
story of neptunians trying to bust up the sun
that i couldnt sleep that night since then

i-am here

  reading over my back copies of scientific-
tion mostly a s i find so many stories that
are very very good one of my outstanding
impressions is the jameson satellite it is
beautifully written and the idea is very ap-
pealing williamsons stories are unique for
their tremendous technical detail they require
real study and as such have depth and sus-
tained interest however one does not par-
ticularly remember his characters and stories
one remembers that one has immensely enjoyed
reading them

  the real classics of scientifiction and i do
not exclude wells verne burroughs etc are
those marvelous series by dr e e smith
they have technical detail and one may appre-
ciate the possibility that smith can build this
up as much as williamson but he does not
write quite that way they require deep
thought they command intense sustained in-
terest they are powerfully written full of bril-
liant ideas they have that appeal of char-
acter and story that impels one to reread them
often and ever and the first installment of
triplanetary is in the authentic seaton tra-
dition

the stories of the jameson statellite we
believe have been very generally appreciated

at their true value there seems to be a peculiar
talent involved in the production of such stories
as embody romance and natural science too
much science will tend to make them read
like a text book too little science takes them
out of our range you will like triplanetary
as it goes along as our magazine has only
recently been published in canada we are
greatly interested in getting letters from can-
adian correspondents-editor

a short and warm appreciation of
our magazine

editor amazing stories 

  triplanetary starts out with a bang hope
it ends that way i had the ill luck to miss
dr smiths skylark series from all the
letters ive read i guess they were plenty
good are you going to give us a story by
c a smith sometime soon morey did a
swell job on the cover for triplanetary hope
you received my subscription for a year of this
wonderful magazine my only regret is that
it isnt published twice a month well before
this letter gets too lengthy i will close

you will find that triplanetary will keep
on banging right up to the last word of
the story we have on hand a story by
the author you refer to though we are not
sure what issue it will appear in the edi-
torial staff would be greatly pleased if the mag-
azine could be published twice a month and we
have ample material to carry out such a plan
but it is in the dim future even if it is there-

mr kellys story evidenced considerable
thought on the part of the author it involves
one odd thing in its name that properly speak-
ing there is no meteorite orbit or perhaps prop-
erly speaking there is but a name is not sup-
plied by the powers that be a shooting star
is a meteor if one of them strikes the earth
it becomes a meteorite but what is it before
it becomes luminous and before it falls to terra
firma there is a question for the lexicog-
rapher we have another story on hand by mr
kelly which we will print soon-editor

editor amazing stories

  this is the first time i have ever written to
the amazing stories and am very much inter-
ested in your magazine once i was talking
to my uncle about this magazine he asked
me why i read such bunk and told me to read
something true i told him that a s stories
gave you pleasant dreams and exciting ones
and also create a good imagination i also
told him i hope most of the stories came true
some day in less than a week i found him
reading one and enjoying it i have a club
to which just another boy and i belong i often
try to get others to join and start talking to
them about infra-red rays space ships planets
or prehistoric animals they just look at me
and blink their eyes and look dumb the only
boy i can talk freely to is my pal i havent
many complaints to make about your magazine
but some of them are  i wish you would have
more pictures through your stories  i wish
paul would illustrate for your magazine again

	i wish you would write more stories on pre-
historic animals and life of the cave people

  i hope you keep the magazine at the same
size it is now for it is handy some of the
stories i have liked best in the old mags were
 the stone from the green star  the
prince of space  the drums of tapajos

	tanks under the sea  the universe
wreckers  across the void  the
incredible formula and many others i am
not very hard to please but i like cave stories
better couldnt you publish some of edgar
rich burroughs stories and illustrate them all
through the stories why dont you put up a
vote and see who would like them

we have published in the past a number of
stories about prehistoric days the ways of the
cave-man the saber toothed tiger the pterodac-
tyl and other monsters of the past and we shall
hope to get more of this type but of course
we depend upon our writers we are over-
stocked with stories and we feel strongly that
the authors of the same are entitled to first
consideration in date of publication-editor

a letter from a member of the fair sex
who likes amazing stories

editor amazing stories

  as a member of the so-called fair-sex i
expect nay demand that my letter be published
otherwise i certainly will have to renew my
subscription which expires soon in order to
see whether it might be published in a much
later issue

i have been enjoying myself only since july
because it was then that i discovered a s

i have been a strong advocate of it ever since
and have defended it from the slights of my
friends who think it is a cheap thriller mag-
azine because they know it in name only that
was exactly how i felt before i started to read
a s and i would still be ignorant of the de-
light which comes from reading such stories as
yours were it not for another friend there-
fore why not do yourself and many prospective
readers a great favor by changing the name
from amazing stories to amazing science
fiction stories i know i am asking a great
deal but it is not to benefit myself that i ask
it for i already know the merits of a s i am
thinking of those who are pining for just such
stories as are found in our magazine but who
do not connect the name a s with science
fiction for your own good wont you do as
i ask the name a s still remains so that
old readers will know it and the new addition
science fiction will gain for you readers by the
hundreds

  to come back to less important subjects but
which do much to lift a magazine far above
the mediocre or even the average i want to
know why you havent been consistent in the
criticism of books one issue has it and the
next issue has not is it because the supply
of scientific books has run out well then
theres always the movies to fall back upon
they have recently been favoring us with films
sprinkled with imaginative science such as the
invisible man

  i must tell you that i find discussions so
very interesting that it is the first thing i
turn to when reading the magazine it is al-
most like a story showing us who can read
between the lines the psychology of the people
who write therein the editors personal
answer at the end of each letter is one feature
which has endeared a s to me for it tends
to bind editor and reader in a closer and more
intimate relationship

  i have just read the january  issue and
it seems that you have started the new year
right i especially feel this way since i am
intensely interested in the mind and its psy-
chology no matter how absorbing planetary
stories may be they do get boring when there
are too many thus it is not asking too much
to give us psychology readers a break and
print more stories like the pellucid horror
master of dreams and the lost language

  i have made many requests and i have still
another to make this i promise will be the
last seeing that your editorial is becoming
bigger and better with each issue i would like
to suggest a fitting topic for this feature it
is the microscope and its use i feel that
there are many readers who like myself have
for a hobby the field of microscopy i am just
an amateur and certainly would appreciate it if
you could set forth in your editorial how to
use the various types of microscopes and where

to find specimens i am sure that it will require
more than one editorial to cover this fascinat-
ing study

  i have never read your quarterly but i see
that the latest issue is out you might hear
from be about its effects and again you might
not so dont depend upon it but do tell me
how youve liked my ravings

  we always get nice letters from members
of your sex you do not indulge in throwing
brickbatz at the unfortunate staff of this mag-
azine the name you suggest is too long and
the two-word name is known all over the world
and it would seem wrong to change it and in-
troducing two words in the middle of the old
name would be a great change and there would
hardly be room for it to be adequately displayed
upon the cover discussions are certainly a
very interesting part of the magazine and we
wish to make them a very important element
the personal desire of the editor would almost
go so far as to wish to give them double the
amount of space they now have there is so
much variety in the different letters that the
discussions are always novel and always of in-
terest as regards microscopy that is best
studied from manuals it is a special branch of
work and has the quality of entrancing those
who practice it-editor

a lady writes us a charming letter of
warm appreciation

editor amazing stories

  after taking a look at the present amazing
stories i am at last convinced that the de-
pression is over for gone is the thin hungry
looking magazine replaced by a nice fat one
even though it is much shorter in height any-
way please excuse my remarks as im only
trying to tell you how much i like a s i
shall never forget that fateful day over
six years ago when i got my hands on my first
copy which has been the cause of my downfall
for ever since i could never resist getting every
copy that came out even though i am not
a regular subscriber i very seldom missed any

  as to the stories well im not throwing any
bricks because almost all of the stories you have
published so far have been in my estimation
excellent each in its own way although the
kinds which i prefer above all are the ones
dealing with time-space traveling the past
or future and about the different planets of the
universe

  and now mr editor id like a word or two
with some of our readers i wish many of
you who throw bricks so lavishly at some poor
author would stop to think that even though he
cant please everybody after all he is only
human and a flower or two and some words of
encouragement would do far more good for
better or worse than a ton of bricks so why

not throw fewer bricks and more flowers but
i guess this queer old world would not seem
natural if there werent any people fighting and
scrapping and arguing about something all the
time thank you mr editor and now
before you carefully deposit this letter in the
waste basket i wish you to know that im
sending you and our mag the best wishes and
luck for the coming year were you listen-
ing

  we enjoy letters from members of the fair
sex provided they restrict themselves to fair-
ness and are not unfair but this correspondent
is so good-hearted that she advocates the throw-
ing of flowers rather than bricks you ask us
if we were listening to your concluding good
wishes and we want to state that we certainly
were-editor

fiction stories

editor amazing stories

  i have been an appreciative reader of amaz-
ing stories for several years but as yet have
not expressed any criticisms regarding the
authors artists or materials contained in the
magazine as a matter of fact this is my first
attempt to communicate with you and it is
scarcely fitting that i should begin with a
bombardment rather i would beg your toler-
ance and correct my errors literally or other-
wise because being a foreigner and having at-
tended english schools only a few years i have
small doubt of my ability to master the en-
glish language

  not wishing to individualize any one subject
in particular i will make my topics as general
as possible and hope you will excuse my aim-
less wanderings first of all i wish to offer
my appreciation and congratulations on your
canadian branch of amazing stories this
enables many ardent followers of your maga-
zine over here to avail ourselves of this oppor-
tunity to continue reading amazing stories
which otherwise would be denied us i said
otherwise because on account of the high
canadian tariff wall coupled with the depre-
ciation of the canadian dollar we were un-
able to purchase direct from the usa that is
from publisher to reader i can safely state
that you yourselves have been quite aware of
this fact for the past two years or more when
you found canadian sales dropping off it
stands to reason that the average reader can-
not afford to pay thirty-five cents or more for
one copy of any magazine during such times
of depression therefore the dealers were not
foolish enough to stock them but with your
present system of a branch over here canadian
readers of amazing stories will no longer
have any difficulties in obtaining their regular

copies and i have no doubt but that your sales
have already increased perceptibly and profit-
ably

  reading through your discussions columns
i cannot help noticing the praises and criticisms
on the authors artists and stories of course
it is every persons right to have his or her
individual opinions but personally i think
it is a gross injustice to attack the authors and
artists some people evidently have a very poor
sense of imagination and practicability they
have little comprehension of the vast account
of imagination and concentration necessary for
an author to pen his ideas situations and char-
acters to paper especially if the narration hap-
pens to be science fiction which calls for alto-
gether different and novel constructions a
science fiction author is a scientist inventor
engineer historian etc if not in fact then
surely in knowledge so we can see what
obstacles such an author would encounter and
would not be human if he did not make an
error theoretically or factually once in a while

  it is the same with artists and i for one
indignantly resent miss i presume margaret
youngs statement i do not like moreys illus-
trations it was rather a blunt and candid
statement and to the point but first be it
understood that i am not criticising the ohio
ladys view-point far be it from me to argue
with any member of the fair sex-any man
should know better but it is true that i do
resent her statement in regard to mr morey
i have no idea what other works of art mr
morey is engaged in but it is a certainty that
his illustrations in the magazine are more than
worthy of praise and deserve a great deal of
credit the work of a scientific artist is even
more difficult than that of the author the
author is fore-armed with the knowledge of
what he is going to create therefore his work
is that much simpler whereas on the other
hand the artist is not and has to create
mentally from what he reads in the story which
often as not is insufficient in details he has
to transfer that mental image to reality on paper
to fit the authors conception of it as much
as possible he does not paint to suit himself
or ae readers as much as he wants to faithfully
portray the authors original thought if his
creations are monstrosities and impossibilities
we should not criticise him because he is paint-
ing only what is required of him by the story
if we continue to criticise the artists they might
be withdrawn and if the illustrations are cut
out the magazine would not be half as inter-
esting

  regarding the stories themselves i can safely
say that seventy-five percent of them are ex-
ceptionally good in plot construction and scien-
tific data where most of them fall down is
in scientific details a good many leave the
science factor absolutely flat and not a few of
them make the reader wonder why they are

called science stories noticeably absent in a
majority of the stories is the element of
romance of course essentially speaking ro-
mance is not usually associated with science
but we must not forget that these stories are
also fiction and a romantic vein always height-
ens the interest of the reader after all we are
still human and as such we are always suscept-
ible to the pathos of that age-old figure cupid
another noticeable fact that might bear men-
tioning is the length of the stories most of them
being too short this type of story is usually
crammed full of scientific explanations with very
little action and space the reader does not
get a chance to absorb all the details before the
story is finished certainly he feels as if he
were precipitated into a cyclone turned end
over end bounced a couple of times then
dumped on the ground and left uncomprehend-
ing like a man just coming out of a nightmare
id much rather have one or two novel-length
stories than a flock of shorts

  however id better terminate this letter be-
fore i utter too much for no author or artist
can please everybody but id be much obliged
if you could give me some dope on some future
scienti-films viz date of release name of pro-
ducing company type of film feature players
etc if this is too much bother just let it slide
and thanks just the same

  this letter from a canadian correspondent
indicates a very full appreciation of our efforts
incident to the publishing of amazing stories
our artist moreys work is appreciated and we
can assure you and our other readers that he
is giving his best thought to his illustrations
you will find that we have sometimes put a
little love motive into some of our pages it
appears for instance in the terror out of
space but some of our readers object
to anything of this sort your letter in which
you embodied well-thought-out criticism will
be enjoyed we are certain by our readers the
fact that a reader writes so elaborate a review

of an issue of amazing stories certainly
speaks well for its contents-editor

  a reply to a critic from a valued author

editor amazing stories

  thank you for the opportunity to reply to mr
lathams interesting criticisms of when the
universe shrank mr latham can sure heave
a wicked brick-bat and hes a pretty good shot
with them too

  however i think i can dodge them all right
this time and show him that i wasnt so far
wrong after all

  in the first place i can assure mr latham
that i made no mistake in the distinction be-
tween mass and weight i have been a teacher


amazing stories

april 

of physics for many years and have spent many
weary hours trying to convince pupils of this
very distinction in fact i very carefully con-
sidered that point before daring to use the
pushing incident

    i think that further consideration will show
 mr latham that the event is possible though
 very improbable as i am quite prepared to
 admit remember that the circumstances were
 pretty desperate

   now even on earth an average man can move
 a very considerable mass with ease provided
 friction and gravity resistance are small take
 for instance the ease with which a man can
 start a heavy automobile rolling by pushing it
 along a smooth road on the level now in this
 case the resistance is well over  percent fric-
 tion which means that only a very small portion
 of the resistance is due to mass inertia

   out in free space there would be absolutely
 no friction and absolutely no gravitational drag
 that would be detectable so that every bit of
 energy would go into the required spot then
 again out in space a mans muscles are free
 from earths drag and i am convinced from
 careful thought that out there if we ever get
 there we shall find our mental and physical
 powers tremendously increased through this very
 freedom from earth-drag now add another
 factor it is well known that under conditions
 of desperation a man can exert man times his
 normal power for a short time here was a
 man in a position of the utmost deperation a
 man with a world to save a man with the girl
 of his heart in the most hideous danger figure
 that part out for yourself mr latham and see
 how much effort he could put forth

   i may add that before using this incident
 which i expected to be questioned i covered
 a good many sheets of foolscap with mathe-
 matics until i was finally convinced that it was
 just possible though i may have slipped up in
 the length of the rod the rod of course
 might be of much greater length than sixteen
 feet for it would be easy to handle out in space
 through its weightlessness not its massless-
 ness and would no doubt be made of some
 metal alloy far more highly resistant than any
 yet produced on earth

   the other point about the shrinkage of
 vehicles etc is also well taken but mr latham
 has im afraid not read very carefully here
 the reduction to  in size was in volume
 not in length which is very different and also
 it must be quite obvious that the earths dia-
 meter shrank as the earth itself shrank other-
 wise there would have been no shrinkage of
 land areas

 i am fully prepared to admit that this shrink-
 age would cause almost incredible inconve-
 nience and before writing the story i made a
 list of these difficulties which numbered nearly
 a hundred items in the end however i de-
 cided that it was not necessary to drag in the
 explanation of them for these reasons

   the changes took place slowly over a great
 number of years therefore an advanced civil-
 ization would be able to meet them and adapt
 their lives to them so that despite inconvenience
 and suffering life would still be endurable

   to include explanation of these difficul-
 ties would increase the length of the story be-
 yond reasonable limits without adding a thing
 to the interest to put it the other way it
 would kill interest through tediousness

   then one assumes that the reader of science-
 fiction has his own imagination and as mr
 latham himself has obviously done they like
 to use that imagination on such problems

   the drag on the intellect through the
 shrinkage not affecting organic bodies does not
 seem to me to be any greater than that due
 to trying to visualize the actual shrinkage itself
 yet that shrinkage was actually prophesized by
 one of our greatest physicists it is of course
 obvious that something like that must have oc-
 curred otherwise no one would have been in
 any way conscious of the shrinkage in fact
 such phenomena may be in progress right now
 for all we can tell

   perhaps after reading these explanations mr
 latham will conclude that my science is neither
 so execrable nor so unpardonable as he
 appears to think the strength of his expres-
 sions rather tempts me to retort by asking him
 to remember the proverb about the dangers of
 a little knowledge i admit i havent any
 too much myself but at least i did take a de-
 gree in physics from englands finest univer-
 sity so the term execrable rather tickles my
 fancy

   this explanation is already too long and i
 dont want to hog all the discussions column
 if mr latham is still unsatisfied i am always
 glad to argue the matter further if he cares to
 write to me direct and heave his brickbats
 straight at me instead of bouncing them off the
 poor editor

   with all good wishes to the editorial staff
 and to the critics

                       jesmond b c
                       canada

   one of our best known authors publishes a
 reply to a critic of the story when the uni-
 verse shrank the letter is so long that we
 do not feel that comment is needed it is so
 easy to criticize unfavorably that too many
 people yield to the temptation but mr burtt
 is well able to take care of himself-editor

editor amazing stories

  as i have been reading your magazine and
others dealing with similar subjects for a num-
ber of years i believe i shall be pardoned for
taking up a little of your time

   i like science fiction stories very much i
acquired the seeds of this affliction as a ten-
year-old boy some thirty-five years ago
when i spent many a happy hour with my old
friend jules verne or rather with one of his
books i may be hard to please or as the years
roll by may have grown more critical-but i
cannot think of a single science fiction story
that would have since given me as much pleas-
ure as the works of that great writer ah
them were the happy days of expectant youth
facing the mysteries of life and avidly reading
stories that gave the imagination free rein

   i presume that this early experience left in
my make-up a preference for stories that make
me think and use my imagination in following
the writer and attempting to go even beyond
therefore i must confess i did not like chil-
dren of the great magma in your august-
september issue i havent found anything in
that story which would in an interesting way
tie up present scientific knowledge with some
logical future development however the story
is well written and interesting as a story per
se but to my mind not what i should class
as a science fiction story in another magazine
i should read it and enjoy it much more in a
science fiction magazine it seems just a little
out of place

   now that i have started in finding fault i
might as well keep it up until i get it all off
my chest i am always disappointed when a
science fiction author makes a statement which
a little ordinary care in refreshing his memory
by reference to a text book would prove to be
wrong i refer to the story the essence of
life in the same issue our friend the author
from across the pond says that when mendel
crossed tall peas with dwarf peas some of the
offspring were tall others dwarf and still others
intermediate i believe that he is mistaken and
that he could have avoided this mistake had he
checked up on this in his experiments gregor
johann mendel found that tallness was the
dominant character in the pea plants in other
words that when you cross a tall pea plant
with a short one the offspring will be tall and
that short or dwarf plants will be produced only


amazing stories

april 

by crossing short plants with short plants in
the same paragraph he says that this offspring
bred true such a text book as i refer to
will also confirm that the offspring cannot be a
true or pure type it is a hybrid for al-
though the recessive character in this case
shortness is hidden or masked and dominated
completely by the dominant character ie the
tallness the plant protoplasm contains one
unit character from each of the two parent
plants under certain conditions of crossing the
recessive character will again crop up how-
ever that would take up too much space and
can be looked up in a text book

  the story i like best in this issue is the
silicon empire it gives me something to
think about it is not one of the exciting kind
of stories with dramatic situations and climaxes
but is a well written science fiction story in
common with quite a few other science fiction
stories it falls down in one particular in speak-
ing of life developing from inorganic silicon
compounds the author says that the conditions
under which the few silicon compounds are
formed that we know of are different from the
conditions under which the corresponding car-
bon compounds form right there a paragraph
contrasting the two sets of conditions and enu-
merating them would furnish a little food for
thought to those of us who like to find a
point to tie up the known with the speculative
however i like this story best

  two short stories ie across the ages
and the pellucid horror arc both well writ-
ten and easy to read i do not know which one
of the two i should put first with respect
to masterly construction descriptive language
and all-around writing technique from a stand-
point of science fiction i prefer the pellucid
horror as there seems to be no scientific
statement of any kind nor a deduction drawn
or speculation based on a known scientific fact
in across the ages all the latter story does
in that respect is to set one thinking about the
vagaries of the human mind under the stress
of some strong emotion coupled with lowered
physical and mental resistance due to extremely
hot weather in the pellucid horror why
did the reporter and the scientist see the doctors
clothes whereas the persons attacked by the
physician had not seen them-undoubtedly the
maniac doctor must have gone out on his trips
sans clothes but why should he put them on
at home knowing that this would give him
away to anyone that might happen to see the
spectacle of the animated clothes

   i shall have to quit for in this part of the
country it has been hot as blazes for over a
month and the fact that i who am neither a
writer nor a scientist have undertaken to
criticise the writings of science fiction writers
makes me wonder whether i myself am not
acting under the influence of some approaching
brainstorm due to the heat i hope the several

authors will bear this in mind and cuss the
weather and not myself besides i believe they
are all good sports and realize that my criti-
cisms are well-meant i also presume all of our
author friends have found out a long time ago
that a good part of the reward of a science
fiction writer comes in the form of bouquets
or shall we say brickbats from a bunch of
ignoramuses who are simply jealous because
they cannot write such good stories themselves
which includes

  yours for just a little more science in sci-
ence fiction

we shall hope to get an answer to this
interesting letter from the author of the
essence of life otherwise your contribu-
tion to discussions tells its own story so well
that it needs no answer from the editor as
regards your wish for more science in science
fiction that is precisely the hard thing to get
it is surprising how little of it comes to us
and how many rejections are due to its lack
in stories we shall hope to hear from you

a vigorous defense of the time travel
topic for stories by william kober-auo an
error in proofreading noted

editor amazing stories

  mr nixons letter in the august discus-
sions objecting to a supposed flaw in the plot
of my story the man who lived twice
shows that from some cause or other perhaps
a fault in my style the main point of the
story missed him completely mr nixon speaks
of an error in the story as if the writing
of it had been a hasty slapping down of an
ill-considered plot a plot so sketchy or absurd
that even its author could not remember it
from one page to another

  the truth is quite the contrary the plot of
this story was carefully developed as a perfectly
defensible method of time-travel in the dis-
cussions one often sees such phrases as cut out
time-travel stories everyone knows theyre im-
possible now in the bright lexicon of sci-
ence fiction the word impossible is anathema
and i thought it would be a good idea to con-
front these cocksure correspondents with a
story of time-travel which though far-fetched
as they all must be could resist at all points
the most diligent attempts to prove a flaw or a
contradiction of any bnoivn scientific law

   i started with the undeniable experimentally
established fact that time moves at different
rates in different places this difference of
rates is caused by difference in a quantity known
technically as gravitational potential einstein
and others have given a complete mathematical
treatment of the relation between time rate
and gravitational potential

  suppose we have a machine which can regu-
april 

amazing stories



late gravitational potential then we can
regulate the rate of time in the range of action
of this machine by slowing it up to half-
normal a man in it may live to be  years
here we have time travel of a sort but
imagination immediately carries us from half-
normal time rate to tenth normal to one-hun-
dredth normal and finally suggests why not
bring time to a halt altogether what would
happen in a region where time did not exist

  here we have a plot in the best form for
science-fiction by carrying known laws in
certain quite valid directions we arrive at a
point where science cannot instruct us here
fiction uncontradictable by science steps in

  this region of no time called timeless-space
in the story is an abnormal condition brought
about by the concentration of enormous energies
we may therefore suppose it to be unstable in
the same sense that a boiler operating under
enormous pressures is liable to explosion we
suppose further that when the explosion or
breakdown does occur the timeless space ap-
pears at two different times in the outside world
the timeless space is by definition indepen-
dent of time in the outside world you see so
that this view is perfectly natural

  now put a hero into the machine and when
the breakdown occurs you have two of him
one in the present say and one in the future to
make a story we need only one more thing if
only the present form of the hero could re-
member what happened to his future form
why he could write up all his adventures in
the future up to the moment of death

  but very obviously you cant remember what
hasnt happened yet so it is necessary to add
another link to the plot-that in some mysteri-
ous way the future form can be considered
to precede the present form of our hero
in loose but clear language we suppose that
time can turn back upon itself

  if i have tried the readers patience with this
long explanation it has been for good reasons
first to show that we authors have gone a
long way since we wrote bang bang bang
went his trusty rifle and three more redskins
bit the dust and went on from there and
second because it is the only answer to the
nixonian objection which is too vague to be
answered in any but the most general terms it
is my impression that mr nixon thinks that
the priority of the future form of the hero
explained in the last paragraph is a careless
error upon my part strangely enough he does
not voice the obvious but answerable objection
that an event in the future cannot in some
subtle sense also be in the past instead he
seems to think that this priority of the future
form will in some way known only to him-
self interfere with the operation of the gravi-
tational potential machine a notion that is
plainly preposterous

  incidentally that silly-sounding pill-ball in

the nixonian communication is really pith-
ball meaning a spherical mass of a very light
plant-substance called pith and while we are
talking of typographical errors i take this
opportunity to tell the a s proofreader that
i will never forgive him for one he allowed to
get into print in the story in my typed manu-
script i had a dramatic passage about a wall
of impassable radiation a change of two
letters transformed it into a satirically critical
wall of impossible radiation and after i
had spent two pages explaining just how the
radiation was generated

  it is always interesting to get a letter from
an author replying to critics of one of his
stories this very full letter shows that mr
kober knows very well how to take care of
himself we are very contrite for the change
of impassable into impossible there is a
certain merit in it though because it would
give suspicions that the printer was impos-
sible and the alleged proofreader was im-
passable-at least that comes pretty near the
mark we are not responsible of course for
what is done in the printing office but in addi-
tion to what is done there every story receives
two proofreadings here in the editorial office

the dirty deal you gave us poor and heretofore
silent subscribers and purchasers of your pub-
lication

  i bought the winter number the other day
without bothering to carefully examine it and
low and behold when i get home and start to
read it i find that the main feature story was
one which i had read ages ago in your monthly
however i checked it off and decided to let
the matter slide as there was considerable
reading matter remaining and i decided that
i would receive my moneys worth from it
but-what do i find that the next most im-

of the latest smith serial triplanetary
three cheers for doc long may he write

  with keller vincent smith nathanson and
miller all having stories printed in the janu-

new year with a bang also i thought moreys
cover illustration was better than usual all
in all this was a banner issue

  i like the new size that amazing stories
has been whittled down to theres no denying
the fact that its much handier and convenient
yet theres just as much reading material as
formerly because you have increased the num-
ber of pages it may be just my imagination
but it seems to me that since the magazine has
become smaller the stories have improved to
a great extent can you explain this fact

  in response to the wishes of your readers i
see that you have removed the offensive sub-
titles that used to play hob with the interest
and suspense of a story a very wise move
mr editor and one you wont regret

  now may i say just a few words about the
quarterly the second deluge by garrett
p serviss was a masterpiece of science fiction
in the fullest sense of the word a finer story
has never appeared in the pages of amazing
stories the current quarterly ought to
satisfy the demads of those who are always
clamoring for a reprint quarterly the men-

both reprints as is the second deluge

  however publish as many reprints as you

of your superb magazine and i cant refrain
myself from instantly writing to you before i
read the whole magazine

read of fiction in either english or spanish

i placed an order in the same store so as to
be sure of getting every number published
which will be saved for me a couple of days

is worth the money paid for it fifty times over

the british interplanetary society

editor amazing stories

  i would be obliged if you would publish this
letter in your discussions columns for the
information of your british readers who may
be interested

  i wish to inform you of the formation of
the british interplanetary society at the ad-
dress given below the society is run on simi-
lar lines to the american french and german
societies its objects to quote from the con-
stitution are the stimulation of public interest
in the possibilities of interplanetary travel and
the dissemination of knowledge concerning the
problems which at present hinder the achieve-
ment of interplanetary travel this involves
the establishment of a central headquarters of
the society which will include a fully equipped
laboratory for the use of members engaged in
active research

  the society is arranging for the establishment
of branches throughout great britain each
branch will concentrate on some particular phase
of space travel as allocated by the central
office by this means co-operation will be as-
sured and wasteful repetition obviated

  three classes of membership are open to in-
dividuals-fellowship membership and asso-
ciate membership associate membership is
for those under twenty-one years of age

  all members will receive free copies of the
journal of the society which will contain news
and articles on the different aspects of inter-
planetary travel

  ordinary meetings of the society are held
fortnightly on fridays from november th at
 dale street liverpool england the office
is on the second floor room  and the meet-
ing starts at  p m lasting until  p m

ticulars by writing to the secretary at the above
