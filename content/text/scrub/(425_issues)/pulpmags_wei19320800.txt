etters are still pouring in to the eyrie about the reprinting of serials in weird
 tales frankenstein is liked by most of you who write in but we have decided
not to run dracula when frankenstein is ended because too many of you
have already read bram stokers great vampire novel those of you who suggest that
we drop the reprint department entirely are so far only a small minority but many
of you think we should abandon the policy of using serials in the weird story re-
print department a policy which we began last year by printing alexandre dumas
interesting werewolf novel the wolf-leader but the question is still open as to
whether we shall reprint some of die lesser known weird novels let us hear from
you on this question

   i wish to make a plea for the small town readers of which i am one writes
donald allgeier of mountain grove missouri i am sure that there are many read-
ers of your wonderful magazine who can not get dracula or frankenstein anywhere
for instance in my home town we have a public library which opens twice a week
new books are a rarity and to find the book you want you must search all the shelves
and probably there is no copy of it there i would probably faint if i found any
weird novels there and as for book stores there are no such things here one per-
son here had a copy of dracula and as soon as this became known every one wanted
to borrow it i was surprized to see the number of protests against your reprinting
dracula oh certainly every one can get this novel at the library or the book store
they say but those who protest certainly do not live in small towns

   ralph slater of hobart oklahoma writes to the eyrie i am heartily in favor
of your reprinting dracula frankenstein and other weird classics in weird tales
your magazine contains enough material exclusive of the reprints to satisfy the read-
ers that have already read them and the reprints will make permanent friends of the
readers that have not read them

   a letter from richard tooker of bismarck north dakota says the current
issue of weird tales makes it necessary for even the jaded reader to remark that
there is something new under the sun the vampire story is a peach and franken-
stein is unbeatable i urge the publication of dracula and all the rest of the old mas-
terpieces

   please do not publish serial reprints especially dracula writes harold hay-
worth of lynch kentucky it is most effective when read all in one night i would

like to see andreyeffs lazarus and merritts the woman of the wood in your reprint
section lazarus is in my opinion the greatest weird taie ever written we have
already printed lazarus in our weird story reprint department-the editors
writes robert c sandison of denver my vote is emphatically for reprints but
personally i rather favor stories over novels frankenstein for instance drags ter
ribly and so does dracula but on the other hand the wolf-leader was a pippin
if all serials could be like that i dont see how any one could object so many of the
very old stories though seem rather ludicrous nowadays there is poes story
berenice after reading the adventures of de grandin i for one was more inclined
to laugh than to shudder at the idea of a maniac digging up a body even though
a living one and pulling all the teeth out of it what i actually did was yawn

   frederick john walsen of denver writes to the eyrie i have ever been an
ardent reader of your unsurpassable magazine and have been delighted with every
issue it is a real joy to read the stories as they are most certainly the best of weird
fiction the best story that you have ever published was one by robert e howard
a fine author called kings of the night the current issue of weird tales is the
finest yet there were three outstanding stories therein namely the brotherhood of
blood by hugh b cave the last magician by david h keller and the nameless
mummy by arlton eadie of these three perhaps the best was the last magician
harold dunbar of chatham massachusetts writes to the eyrie i found it ex-
ceedingly difficult to select between the ghoul gallery and the brain-eaters for
ranking place in the june issue after long thought i feel that the honor should go
to the hugh b cave story for its vivid descriptive passages and masterful climax
this author has a fine rolling style and a depth which few writers of weird fiction
can rival his brotherhood of blood in the may issue which went into my file of
stories worth saving was outstanding for human interest and brilliant color and
now the author has shown remarkable versatility in presenting a grim and shuddeiy
type of horror with equal effectiveness i hope we may have more of mr cave the
brain-eaters by frank belknap long jr easily takes second place and seabury
quinns serial third the final paragraph of clark ashton smiths little story the
weird of avoosl wuthoqquan should be classed among the few great climaxes of
all time

   please accept this as another vote against reprinting the book dracula writes
ernest h ormsbee of albany new york i have a copy of dracula in my library
and each of my friends who read weird stories has one the public library reading
rooms have copies so it does not seem as though there would be many readers of this
type of fiction who are unfamiliar with this great story but i will second the request
of a recent reader who asks that some other story by bram stoker be substituted

   i am delighted to see hugh b caves name in weird tales writes doctor
frank l mead of medford massachusetts i never read the magazine before and
was surprized at the array of talent i have been reading caves stories since they
first appeared in classmate some years ago his stories get one if you see what i
mean give the brotherhood of blood a vote for me and put the ghoul gallery
down as even better

city-------------state
of the peacock

by e hoffmann price

a powerful weird novelette of devil-worship and the hellish underground
fastnesses where abdul malaak and his crew concoct
their ghastly rhythms

ademoiselle said pierre
dartois after a moments re-
flection there is really no rea-
son for your being alarmed at repeatedly
dreaming that you are opening a grave
after all a dream-

  monsieur  she demanded does one
in a dream break ones finger nails just
look

  she thrust her hands fingers extended
squarely before our eyes the nails were
ragged and broken and beneath them
was a distinct trace of verdigris

  i left them just as they were this
morning verdigris and all to show you
how tve been pawing at that door again
my new slippers and gown were torn and
soiled with green mold from kneeling
before it its driving me mad

  in her eyes was a terrible haunted look
that made them a starless somber mid-
night

  pierre dartois studied first the slim
white fingers with their marred nails and
then the dark surpassing loveliness of
diane livaudais

  but where do you walk asked dar-
tois

  she shrugged her faultless shoulders
and made a despairing gesture of the
hand

  if i only knew but i dont first
there was some one talking to me in my
sleep though i couldnt ever recollect
exactly what the voice said to me i
always had the impression when i awoke
that there was a grave that i was to open

     

and somehow i felt that it was etienne
who called me you know monsieur
dartois i was very fond of etienne and
living in that house he gave me it was
only natural that id have him on my
mind

  when queried pierre did etienne
give you that house on rue ladiepaillet

  its over two years ago several
months after he disappeared i received a
letter from him from marrakesh saying
that he was seriously wounded and that if
he died he wanted me to live in his house
on rue lachepaillet then a month or
so later i learned that he was dead just
a clipping from a paper in marrakesh-
a french newspaper you understand-
and a note in arabic which i had doctor
delaronde translate it confirmed the
clipping saying that etiennes last words
had been that he wanted me to have his
house in bayonne and the personal effects
in it

   so she continued living in that leg-
acy and missing him terribly i would
easily dream of him and wake with the
sense of having heard his voice i felt his
presence as though he were seeking to
speak some final thought that his friend
had not included in that scrap of arabic
script

  by the way said pierre have you
those bits of paper

  and then as mademoiselle livaudais
took them from her handbag dartois
continued the voice became more in-
sistent
the bride of the peacock



tvftii

ml stm

wjmetres blade projected a foot beyond his

opponents back

  yes though it wasnt really a voice
i would awake with the feeling that some
one had given an order an overpower-
ing will forcing me to some vague task i
couldnt quite remember except for some-
how associating it always with a grave a
task i couldnt accomplish and couldnt
evade

  and always etiennes presence

  yes and no she answered i dont
know an oppressing confusion a dom-
inant crushing will not like etienne at
all he was domineering-you may have
known him-but not in that remorseless
way he loved me almost as much as

i loved him but this is relentless inhu-
man yet i sense etienne in it

  and   she again extended her
fingers this proves that just last night
i was trying to open the door of a vault
as on so many other nights gown tat-
tered slippers soiled verdigris under
my nails im weary weary to death
you should have seen me sooner

  it was so outrageous so i kept it to
myself but now i want you to find out
where i am going and why before i lose
my mind entirely

  pierre rose and from a drawer in his
desk took a tiny vial a part of whose


weird tales

amber-colored contents he poured into a
small stemmed glass

  drink he suggested it is a sed-
ative it will make you relax you must
relax look me full in the eye    bet-
ter yet look intently at the ring on my
finger    then think of nothing at
all   

   i noted then that pierre had seated his
visitor so that she faced a strong glaring
light

  you are weary from trying to remem-
ber    cease trying and it will come
to you  

  pierres voice was droning monot-
onously

  dont try to remember    you are
weary    weary    weary of try-
ing    think of nothing    noth-
ing    nothing at all he persisted in
soporific accents

her eyes were staring fixedly at the
stone that flamed and pulsed daz-
zlingly on pierres hand id never known
pierre to wear a diamond of any kind
much less that obtrusive massive clot of
fire

  her lips half parted and her breath
came very slowly and rhythmically in ca-
dence to pierres measured purring sylla-
bles

   she was in a trance induced by a drop
of a hypnotic and pierres compelling
will

   again he spoke still with that murmur-
ing monotony

  you are sleeping    soundly   
deeply    so deeply that you wont
waken until i call you    do you un-
derstand

  yes she murmured i wont awak-
en   until    you call

  then pierre spoke in a voice of com-
mand

  it is now last night the voice is
speaking repeat it to me

  pierre leaned forward his long fin-
gers gripped the carved arms of his chair
perspiration cropped out on his brow now
cleft with a saber-slash of a frown diane
stirred uneasily made a gesture of pro-
test

  you will speak and tell me i com-
mand and you must obey he said sol-
emnly and deeply as the chanted ritual
of a high priest

   i myself was ready to leap or yell from
the terrific tension that moment by mo-
ment had been becoming more and more
acute i sensed a power that was ham-
mering at pierre through dianes resist-
ance

  then pierre prevailed the tension
eased she spoke in painfully clear-cut
mechanical syllables and in persian not
the colloquial persian of which i knew a
smattering but the rich language of the
old days

  now answer demanded pierre as
you have been answering

  etienne she began in french but
as mechanical as before i cant find the
spring but ill return tomorrow night
and try again  i cant understand
what you are saying  the drums are
too loud and they dont want me to un-
derstand  

  etienne marquis de la tour de ma-
racq not dead in far-off morocco in some
obscure tomb beyond the red walls of
marrakesh but buried in one of the
crypts that honeycomb the foundations of
bayonne and she spent her nights an-
swering him and seeking him

  but it couldnt be the dead dont
chant from their graves it must be the
hysteria of a woman mourning a dead
lover i insisted to myself as i heard
those outrageous words

  and then i looked at pierre my in-
sistence mocked me he trembled vi-
olently his lips moved soundlessly and
the bride of the peacock



be swayed slightly he was exerting his
supreme effort but not another word
could he drag from diane pierre was
beaten eg a standstill

   he relaxed and sighed deeply

  never to be too much damned rev-
enant i will meet you face to face and
you will speak to me he exclaimed

   he smiled that grim cold smile i once
saw on his face as he crossed blades one
unforgotten night with one who on that
night ceased to be the most deadly swords-
man in france

   pierre struck his hands sharply together

  enough awaken he ordered

   and as diane started and blinked and
looked confusedly about her tell me
mademoiselle do you understand per-
sian

  of course not replied diane but
why

  you spoke persian when i asked you
to repeat-

  oh did i say anything

  mats certainement i commanded
and you spoke and half the population
of hells back yard fought to break my con-
trol but you spoke listen

   pierre repeated dianes words

   did  say that she demanded incred-
ulously

  indeed you did mademoiselle i as-
sured her

  why who ever heard of such a
thing

   i for one affirmed pierre an il-
literate servant girl delirious from fever
chanted ancient hebraic to the mystifica-
tion of the doctors it developed finally
that she had once lived with the family of
a german savant and used to hear him
reciting hebraic texts and this was im-
pressed upon her subconscious mind
which was released in her delirium

  similarly some one has spoken per-

sian either to your ear or to your mind at
some time

  tell me did you ever hear this in any
 language

  and pierre recited

   when i am dead open my grave and see
     tbe smoke bat curls about thy t

   in my dead heart the fire still burns for thee
      yea the smoke rises from my winding sheet

  diane shuddered

  beautiful but ghastly

  as for me i had heard and often ad-
 mired that macabre persian conceit yet
 this time an evil lurked in the amorous
 fancy that hafiz chanted to some girl in a
 garden of shiraz nine hundred years ago

  and you replied i cant find the
 spring you said that the drums kept you
 from understanding you did well to
 come to me i will fight this to a finish
 its or mine

   do you really think its etienne calling
 from his grave

  diane asked this question in a hesitant
 voice abashed at her outlandish query

  mademoisellereplied pierre i am
an old man and i am none too positive
about the impossibility of anything yet
if he is speaking from satans throne
room i will find him and silence him for
no honest lover would haunt you this
way

  pierre rang for his man raoul

  my good friend landon will join me
 in this campaign we will be your guard-
 ians raoul will drive you home and
 this evening we may see you landon
 and i

  diane graciously offered her hand

  monsieur dartois and you monsieur
 landon have restored my courage i
 feel ever so much better and do call to-
 night if you wish a bientot

  with a wave of her hand and a smile
 for the moment free from the shadow of
 the grave she followed raoul to the lssot-
 ta coupe


weird tales

-pierre i said as the door clicked be-
jl hind diane when she was in that
trance you might have commanded her to
ignore the voice

  not at all that would be like put-
ting a plaster cast over an ulcer i must
rather find and exterminate the cause of
this outrageous thing that talks to her
and makes her sleep a wandering night-
mare never think that she told us more
than a fraction of what she does and hears
and says in her sleep something fought
me face to face as i commanded her to
speak and as she spoke i suddenly lost
control

  the devil you say i felt it my-
self    do you believe-

  anything is possible in bayonne re-
plied pierre anything may thunder and
whisper from the ancient night of the pas-
sages and labyrinths that undermine ba-
yonne bayonne was founded by the ro-
mans whose legionaries worshipped mith-
ra and cybele in subterranean crypts the
saracens the spanish the french the bear-
nais have made this the playground of
armies and have enriched the earth with
dead this is all soil well raked over and
alive with strange seeds apostate priests
have chanted the terrible foulness of the
black mass and mediaeval necromancers
and thaumaturgists have pursued their
crafts in those unremembered red pas-
sages and vaults

  sometimes the church hounded them
to the surface and roasted them at the
stake good and evil alike but more re-
mained intact than ever were unearthed

  i myself once saw a vault opened up
when builders excavated for the founda-
tion of a house many years ago-

  pierre shuddered

  it is not so much what i saw as the in-
ferences i was compelled to draw now
from behind some brazen gate a presence
commands diane to enter her dead

lover calls her to god knows what terrible
festival among the dead or something
impersonates the dead marquis for some
purpose beyond imagining some linger-
ing trace of an ancient force that has come
to life and strengthened itself through
feeding on her susceptible mind

  and now please dispense with my
company while i study various things
notably this clipping and this scrap of a
note

  those partagas cigars are at your el-
bow and there is a decanter of arma-
gnac

  so saying pierre left me to my own re-
sources

i prowled about his study peering at
the titles of books ranged row after
row on their shelves scrutinizing the clus-
tered simitars ripple-edged kreeses keen
tulwars and the sheaves of lances and as-
segais standing in a comer and here and
there were epees with their bell guards
and slim three-cornered blades each a
trophy of some encounter of pierres
younger days when the duel was not the
comic opera affair it is today

  raoul entered presented pierres com-
pliments and left a tray of cold meats
cheese and a bottle of thin dry wine
strange how a fellow that keeps such ex-
cellent brandy would have such terrible
sour wine but it wasnt so bad   
and neither was bayonne    with a
quiet month or so the most of which was
to be devoted to acting as pierres second
in fencing with a dead marquis who de-
claimed the diivan of hafiz from his
grave in marrakesh but i didnt blame
the marquis that girl would make any
one turn over in his grave

  and then pierre reappeared

  i see that you have survived those
sandwiches h iamericain which raoul
constructed good but i have a task for
 
you
the bride of the peacock



  lead on i replied

  alors my good raoul will drive you
to mademoiselle dianes house whe you
will take your post at the door of her bed-
room you will stand watch and if she
walks in her sleep follow her even to the
fuming hinges of hells back door but by
no means wake her and here he con-
tinued is a pistol and a clip of cartridges
and a flashlight

  i thrust the luger into my hip-pocket
tested the flashlight and found it in good
order

  it seems i commented that we are
not dealing entirely with dead men mut-
tering in their graves

  from what i learned - possibly i
should say inferred-while you were ab-
sorbing the most of that decanter of ar-
magnac replied pierre there is some-
thing in what you say in the meanwhile
keep your mind strictly on your work and
do not be too free with that pistol i will
be on hand later to relieve you and i pre-
fer not to have you riddle me in error
shall we leave the door open

  no answered pierre i have a most
accomplished pass key a tantot

  and pierre returned to his holy of ho-
lies to answer the telephone as i followed
raoul to the isotta

lfonsieur landon greeted the
ivl lovely livaudais as she admitted
me you dont know how relieved i am
that monsieur dartois has taken things in
hand but what is he doing this eve-
ning

  lord alone knows beyond busily
studying that clipping and that note from
the marquis unknown friend in morocco
and his telephone rang continually hes
hot on the trail of something or he
wouldnt have sent me to stand guard at
your door tonight

  good god am i then in such dan-
ger

  by no means i am here merely to
follow you if you wander tonight

  splendid then i shall bid you good-
night surely you forgive my being such
an anything but gracious hostess you
know its been a trying day there on
the table is a decanter of grenache and
cigarettes

  perhaps you might show me the
switches that control the lights i sug-
gested i prefer to watch in the dark
but i may need light in a hurry

  after showing me the switch made-
moiselle livaudais bade me good-night
i selected the most uncomfortable chair
in the living-room not such a difficult
task with that array of somber teak
carved by artizans who since they sat
cross-legged on the floor had no con-
ception of comfort as applied to chairs-
and set it near the bedroom door then
i took a length of heavy thread id
brought for that purpose and tied one end
of it to the door-knob and the other to a
heavy bronze ash-tray which i set on a
chair at the other side of the door thus
if she opened the door and caught me
napping the fall of the ash-tray would
arouse me jot that i expected to doze
but rather th i didnt want to take any
chances

  i settled down to watch it wasnt like
military sentry duty where a moment of
drowsiness might cost the lives of an en-
tire outpost there was nothing to do
but sit there in that exquisitely carved teak
strait jacket with my reflections for com-
pany

  and i wasnt the least bit drowsy my
mission effectively prevented that i won-
dered if the dead marquis materialized
and led her to a hidden panel or called
from the street or tapped on her window-
pane the whole thing was outrageous
so much so that the marquis murmuring in
his grave occupied a much smaller place


weird tales

in my thoughts than this exceedingly love-
ly diane

  in fact i began to think with decided
disapproval of the marquis although to
be honest about it he was handicapped in
a way

  and thus and thus   

  then i wondered at the sweetness that
subtly pervaded the room strange i
hadnt noticed it before well those par-
tagas cigars of pierres had been heavy
enough to dull my sense of smell for a
while certainly id not notice that del-
icate perfume tike the ghost of incense
the very ashes of an odor

  im sure i wasnt asleep and hadnt
been even for a moment of that watch
and yet as i look back at it all i couldnt
have been awake

  something was emerging from the
darkness of dianes living-room i sat
there contemplating the shadow that ma-
terialized from the shadows as though of
all things in the world there was nothing
more commonplace than that the black-
ness should coalesce into a shape

  i regarded with mild curiosity the sil-
very gleam that deliberately drew closer
i wondered what mummery was in prog-
ress

  it might of course be a knife perhaps
i should really shift a bit to one side or
else it would pin me to the back of my
chair it came nearer   

  then something within me snapped i
knew that i had been sleeping with my
eyes open and fully conscious with a
terrific start i moved just in time to evade
the stroke

  the intruder instinctively sought for an
instant to wrench his dagger free from the
unyielding hardwood which held it fast
so that i had him well by the throat before
he abandoned his weapon and met me
hand to hand

  he was lean as a serpent and long-

armed as an ape but i eluded his dutch
and drove a fast one to his jaw that sent
him reeling back into the darkness it
shook him it should have laid him out
cold but he came back for more

   as he recovered and closed in a fresh
poniard in hand i drew my pistol and
fired

  i saw him sag in the middle and crum-
ple riddled by that hail of lead at close
range saw another shape emerge from the
darkness at my left but before i could
shift my fire there was a heavy impact
behind my ear and then i saw nothing
at all save abysmal blackness shot with
livid streaks and dazzling flashes

  wheres pierre was my last thought
as i met the floor still clutching the pistol

 dont know how long i was out my
head was spinning crazily as i opened
my eyes and saw pierre regarding me with
mingled solicitude and amusement

   so he railed i leave you on guard
and here i find you flat on your face
no matter your stout skull seems none
the worse

  but what happened to the corpse
queried dartois as i clambered to my
feet and dropped into a chair

  what corpse

  he indicated the pistol lying on the
floor where it had slipped from my fin-
gers when my grip had relaxed and
pointed at the empty cartridge-cases glit-
tering on the rug

  some one    how would you say
it    was polished off you never
miss

   flattering but true

   that dark splash that stained the pol-
ished hardwood floor at the edge of the
rug did indicate some one seriously rid-
dled

   it all came back to me

  they crept up on me i was asleep
the bride of the peacock



with my eyes open i came to in the nick
of time and number two slugged me
just as i accounted for number one

  i wrenched the poniard from the chair
lucky i snapped out of it i con-
tinued good lord but i cant under-
stand how i watched that fellow slip up
on me without my moving until it was
almost too late i wonder if it could

have been that perfume-

  what perfume queried pierre

   i sniffed twice thrice

  be damned pierre but its gone
that must have been it

  but dartois was looking at the pon-
iard and had nothing to say about van-
ished doors

  mats regardez done here take the
slant

  he pointed at the inlay in delicate
hair-lines of pale gold that decorated the
slim curved blade

  very pretty job of inlaying i ad-
mitted never saw a peacock more
beautifully drawn

  imbecile fumed pierre so its
only a pretty bit of engraving to you this
peacock but its a wonder mademoiselle
diane hasnt been disturbed with ah the
rioting and shooting could she have
walked out before our very eyes

  no look at that string knotted to
the door-knob and the ash-tray its not
been disturbed shes still asleep
nevertheless i must look

  pierre opened the door

  death and damnation shes gone
he exclaimed walked right out before
your eyes

  gone she was not through the door
i had watched and not through the win-
dows between whose bars nothing larger
than a cat could have crept

  no and not up the chimney an-
nounced pierre then where

  through the floor or the wall per-
haps i hinted

  dartois took me at my word on
hands and knees he explored the floor
and the tiled hearth poking and thrusting
about with the blade of his penknife seek-
ing for some trace of a catch or spring
which would release a trap-door or sliding
panel and then he devoted his attention
to the paneled walls but in vain if
there was any secret exit secret indeed it
was

  but pierre was by no means discour-
aged

  let this rest for the moment he di-
rected and we will search the rest of the
apartment

  but i protested that isnt finding
diane

  finding diane he replied may not
be the most important thing at present
she has been carrying on her nocturnal
wanderings for some time and from each
trip she has returned it is likely that she
will return this time also

  how about trailing those assassins that
nearly polished me off

  eminently sensible admitted dar-
tois if we could follow them the trail
would doubtless lead to the source of the
deviltry your letting moonlight through
one of them must have been most discon-
certing look they left through the
door and none too deliberately

   pierre pointed at the trail of blood and
a footprint on the hardwood floor

   but this will have to be investigated by
daylight he continued and that would
advertise our moves to the enemy fin-
ally i suspect that the trail would be lost
very soon after it is picked up in the street
let us rather inspect this house of the
dead marquis

  and while pierre did the serious in-
specting i prowled about admiring the
antique feraghan carpet that shimmered


weird tales

silkily under my feet the floor lamp of
saw-pierced damascene brasswork the
oddly carved teak statuettes from tibet
curious bits of jade and lacquer and on
the mantel was a silver peacock with out-
spread fan

  look exclaimed pierre interrup-
ting my contemplation of the rare and
strange adornments of the room be-
hold unusual nest-ce pas

  i took the book he offered me thumbed
its pages

  whats so unusual about that looks
like arabic or persian    good god
pierre its bound    damned if it isnt
human skin

  i saw that also but i referred to the
title

  but thats the back cover

  que voulez-vous where would you
have it in such a language but look at the
title itself

  you forget that i cant read this
scratching i reminded pierre try it
yourself

  mpardon well then it is entitled
kitab ul aswad

  of course the black book man-
ifestly appropriate title matches the
color of the cover now this one i con-
tinued indicating a red-bound american
best seller should be called kitab ul
abhmar

  idiot growled pierre have you
ever heard of the black book

  and to forestall any further irrelevant
replies pierre opened the book and read
aloud in sonorous arabic

  which is to say he translated know-
ing that the old literary arabic is too
much for any but a scholar god created
of fire seven bright spirits even as a man
lights seven tapers one after the other and
the chief of these was malik tawus to
whom he gave the dominion of the world
and all that therein is so that god sleeps

dreamlessly while bis viceroy mbs as
seemeth good to him

  odd enough i admitted but what
of it except that the evening is super-
abundant with peacocks first they try to
ream me out with a blade inlaid with a
peacock and then i stand here admir-
ing the silver image of a peacock on the
mantel and now you read me of malik
tawus say now was that malik or
malaak

  malik replied pierre although he
has been called malaak as well

  and you end i resumed by favor-
ing me with a rich passage about the
king lord or angel peacock according
as the scribe splashed his reed or the tra-
dition garbled the story-

  i heard something in her room pi-
erre interrupted

  and pierre who had preceded me
halted and whirled to face me at dianes
door

  she has returned while we babbled
of black books

  impossible

  then take a look challenged pierre

  i looked and i saw

  diane lay curled up in her great can-
opied bed sound asleep on her feet
were satin boudoir slippers torn and
scarred and soiled

  she went and she returned before
our eyes

  and then diane spoke but not to us

  i found the spring etienne but i
couldnt move the panel ill return to-
morrow night   

  good lord its got her

  dont wake her commanded pierre
let her sleep weve been outman-
euvered alors we will retire in confu-
sion get ourselves some sleep and tomor-
row-we shall see what we shall see

after a later breakfast pierre and i
k drove across the river to the third
guards cemetery turned back to town
and then through the mousserole gate
across the drawbridge and into the hills
dartois apparently was idling away his
time bid having seen him open and smoke
his way through the second pack of bas-
tos which smelled no less of burning
rags than the first pack i knew that he
was far from loafing whenever we
passed the obsolete gun emplacements
casemates or lunettes in the surrounding
hills pierre would slow up stare a mo
ment refer to a sketch mutter to himself
and step on the gas again

   vauban built that    and that also
was erected by vauban   was the
sum of his comments

  we were retracing our course the
jovial bearded and mitered statue of car-
dinal lavigerie welcomed us to place de
theatre

  doubtless we should pause for a
drink

   the ants del oso is not so bad i sec-
onded

   but in vain

  pierre drew away from the curb and
thence to the left skirting the park that
lies outside the walls and moat on the side
toward the biarritz road again to the
left turning our backs to biarritz we
headed into porte despagne and the old
guard house driving across the causeway
that at this point blocks the moat

  vauban it seems built the whole
works i remarked and then hello
whats this stop a moment-

   but dartois cleared the breach in the
wall utterly ignoring my desire to pause
and look

  and then he spoke

  jackass do you fancy that i didnt
see those several men roaming about the
green between the edge of the moat and
w t-

the spring of st leon with surveyors in-
struments and the like and need i im-
press upon you that they are by no means
surveying and that those instruments are
by no means transits and levels alors
why need we pause and stare at those good
men

  all of which suggested that pierre
knew more about the goings on at the
spring of st lon than he cared to pub-
lish in the papers

  well perhaps vauban didnt build
the whole works i began seeing that
surveyors had been definitely dismissed
i would imagine that wed find the en-
trance somewhere near the ancient part of
the city not far from the cathedral pos-
sibly near that fountain-

   erected on the site of the castle of the
hastingues taken by assault in the
eleventh century by the bayonnais
quoted pierre mockingly from the guide
book

  i ignored the jibe and continued
and to find it well have to cover the
ground stone by stone

  but pierre was taking no hints that af-
ternoon

  impossible he exclaimed it would
take weeks and then wed be too late
what do you mean too late

  very much what i say mon vieux in

a word-

  pierres gesture was painfully expres-
sive

  well said i the whole thing sounds
like a chinese dream all of it

  un reve chinois do you say com-
ment was it a mongolian vision that
came so close to pinning you to the back
of your chair after you an old campaigner
went to sleep with your eyes open an hour
after taking your post an asiatic dream
that you shot to ribbons when you awoke
from your unaccountable sleep we
must work fast and this time there shall


weird tales

be no jugglery of taking her away and re-
turning her under our very eyes

  what do you propose

  we will both stand watch in her
room

  after what happened last night i
objected they may get both of us with
some devils trick like that whiff of per-
fume

  i have considered that replied dar-
tois and we will see there was never
a peacock hatched who can twice in the
same way outwit pierre dartois nor is
it likely that the enemy would repeat that
same device they have too many tricks

raoul admitted us

 monsieur he began a visitor is
waiting for you in the study

  magnifique and is she handsome
mais monsieur he is a foreign dig-
nitary an emir

  then offer him a drink and assure
him that in but one moment i will have
the honor of greeting him

  in pierres study we found the guest a
lean wiry fellow with a predatory nose
and the keen eye of a bird of prey a
broad seamed scar ran from his right eye
to the point of his chin and another
stretched diagonally across his forehead
strangely familiar mustaches fringed his
lip and then i-remembered that during
the past few days i had fancied seeing
foreign faces in bayonne where scarcely
any face is foreign yet those were lean
and swarthy in a different manner and
were set off with mustaches whose droop
and cut were decidedly outlandish and
just this afternoon i intercepted a glance
that was too casual to be convincingly
casual

  there was nothing after all remarkably
strange about those fellows only-
well they didnt wear coat and trousers
with the manner of those born to our
stupid costume

  your servant began our visitor after
a pause that was just long enough to be
as impressive as his bow doubtless an-
nounced me as nureddin zenghi an emir
from kurdistan

  he glanced sharply about him stared
at me for a moment and found my pres-
ence acceptable all this while dartois re-
turned the emirs bow with one of equal
profundity and rigidity

  but in all fairness he continued
picking his words with just the suggestion
of an effort i must confess that i am
somewhat more than an emir the fact

of it is that i am-

  he lowered his voice almost to a whis-
per

  i am the keeper of the sanctuary

  ah    monseigneur le-

  dartois paused to select a suitable
title propriety above all else was pierre

  emir if you must be formal mon-
sieur dartois although i am incognito
extremely so in fact

  a votre service monsieur iemir
acknowledged pierre and again bowed in
his inimitable fashion which i endeav-
ored to duplicate as he presented me

  it is difficult to bow elegantly while
seeking to keep a couple of fingers near
the butt of a pistol in ones hip pocket

  as i said resumed our visitor i am
keeper of the sanctuary at djeb el
ahhmar in kurdistan the center of the
faith viceroy so to speak of malik
tawus

  peacocks i thought were becoming
monotonous i thought of that dagger i
had barely escaped last night and that
book in dianes parlor

  moreover continued the emir i am
a friend of france

  the emir was impressive but not ex-
cessively coherent i thought but pierre
was equal to waiting without committing
himself
the bride of the peacock



  all of which i appreciate and respect
but pray continue my lord keeper

  i wondered just what ax the emir
wished to grind on the friendliness to
france

  therefore continued the emir i
am here to seek your aid in doing france
a signal service and at the same time
overthrow a malignant impostor

  a pretender i fancy to the custody of
the sanctuary suggested pierre fencing
like the master swordsman that he was
with word and steel alike

precisely and it will be very much
to your interest to help me monsieur
artois indeed the welfare of your
protegie mademoiselle diane livaudais
is closely linked with my own success
pierre essayed a feint

  you mean monseigneur that you will
lead me to the hidden vault where made-
moiselle diane spends her nights seeking
to enter the presence that asks her to open
his grave

  the emirs brows rose in saracenic
arches

   that is interesting of course but most
obscure evaded the emir in fact i am
by no means certain that i understand
what you have in mind

  but continued the emir this is
what i have in mind abdul malaak
who came from kurdistan three years ago
to seize the local sanctuary-yes as you
surely have learned from the events of the
past few days the servants of malik ta-
wus gather in conclave here in bayonne-
abdul malaak has succeeded in using his
occult science to gain control of the mind
and will of your protegee mademoiselle
livaudais and when his control is com-
plete he will use her as an outside agent
to operate in his cause in france as a
spy unearthing information from various
prominent persons he will designate she
will to all intents and purposes be a charm-

ing gifted woman acceptable and ac-
cepted in the best circles but in fact she
will be no more than an automaton her
every thought and word dictated by ab-
dul malaak who sits in a solitarium be-
hind the throne in the hall where the con-
clave meets

  ah    indeed    most interest-
ing monsieur ismir replied dartois
and is it presumptuous to inquire as to
the nature of abdul malaaks plans

  by no means assured the emir i
am a friend of france

  there was the stone now for the ax
he wished to grind thereon

  abdul malaak has assembled a circle
of adepts in occult science explained the
emir some from hindustan others
from tibet and high asia many from
kurdistan and armenia and azerbaijan
the land of fire and each a master in
the science of fundamental vibration

  to give you a crude example-
though to a mind like yours an example
is scarcely needed-a company of troops
on foot marching in cadence can wreck a
bridge the note of a violin string which
is attuned to the fundamental vibration of
a goblet will cause the goblet to shiver to
fragments

  precisely agreed dartois

  and going from the physical to the
mental let one man in a theater rise and
shout fire there will be a panic

  thus these adepts will concentrate in
unison on whatever thought they wish to
project so that through the principle of
resonance they will uncork the vast reser-
voir of hidden discontent with society re-
ligion and politics that exists in france as
in every country and in the end effect the
overthrow of established rule

  as in russia i interposed

  exactly assented the emir you
also are a person of rare comprehension
and to bring us up to date i was not
amazed at what happened in spain not


lweird tales

long ago to the bourbons and being a
friend of france i am here to seek your
aid in thwarting this powerful engine of
destruction single-handed i would be
hopelessly outnumbered for while i have
friends in the circle they have been cor-
rupted by abdul malaak and turned
against me

ery well monsieur iemir i am with
you heart and soul but tell me is
it true that the marquis de la tour de
maracq is dead

  who says that he is dead countered
the emir

   it has been written replied pierre

  what is written may be history or
prophecy who can say

  score one for the emir he didnt
know whether pierre was for or against
the marquis he was sure of pierres in-
terest in diane and in friends of france

  may i ask-and i trust again that i
do not presume said pierre -why it
is that you are so anxious to thwart ab-
dul malaaks plans i mean you com-
prehend aside from your friendship for
france

  that is simple our cult is divided by
a schism there are those who seek tem-
poral power and those who care only for
peaceful spreading of the cult of malik
tawus the lord -of the world we be-
lieve that he has no need of or desire for
political machinations in his behalf and
that in due course the lord of the painted
fan will himself assume the throne of the
world and exalt those who believe in
him-just as your early christians said
of the nazarene

  now be pleased to give me a pencil
and paper i will make you a sketch

  the emir hitched his chair up to pi-
erres desk

  this was a bit too good to be true i
remembered that saying about greeks
bearing gifts the events of the past two

days had likewise made me wary of altru-
istic kurds i loosened my pistol

  dartois caught the move from the
side of his eye and shrugged his shoul-
ders negligently

  start at porte despagne began the

emir as he traced a line then--

  but he spoke no further

  something flickered through the open
window the emir faced he pitched for-
ward clawing at his chest i drew and
fired then leaped to the window and
fired again not with any hope of hitting
the figure that was disappearing around
the first turn of the alley just as i pressed
the trigger but at least to give him my
blessing

  give me a hand said dartois

  the hilt of a dagger projected from the
emirs chest he shuddered coughed
blood which joined the stain on his shirt-
front

  porte despagne    to the left   
great peril    take    many   

armed    men-

  he clutched the hilt of the dagger tore
open the front of his shirt and with a
final effort snatched from about his throat
a thin golden chain from which depended
a tiny amulet a silver peacock with tail
fanned out and jewelled with emeralds

  neither dartois nor i could under-
stand the utterance that was cut off by
another gush of blood

  tout fini exclaimed pierre he of-
fered us this when he knew he couldnt
give us even another scrap of information
this glittering fowl must be a token of
admittance

  draw the shades commanded dar-
tois and get away from that window
likewise stand guard until i return on
your life admit no one not any one
the police i suggested i fired
two shots

  i will handle the police no one must
the bride of the peacock



know that the keeper of the sanctuary is
dead as long as they are in doubt we
have a weapon against them for they
thought him important enough to kill him
before he could tell his story

  as dartois dashed out i barred the
door after him

t could hardly share pierres optimism
x about the police here we had a
stranger in the house neatly harpooned
with a knife and what a story wed have
to tell some one tossed a dagger through
the open window just as the keeper of
the sanctuary was to explain where diane
wandered every night to claw at the door
of a vault whose occupant commanded her
to open his grave even an american
jury would choke at a tale like that

   i picked up one of the drab little things
which in france pass as magazines and
come across an article on the prevalence
of murder in the united states

  this is good i reflected now here
in law-abiding bayonne i sit peacefully at
the door of a ladys bedroom and some
one tries to dissect me with a nicely dec-
orated dagger the next day a visitor
has his conversation punctuated by a knife
thrown through the window by parties
unknown 

  i shifted a bit more out of range of the
window and checked up on the cartridges
in the luger

  to crown it ill get buck fever and
let daylight through raoul or pierre when
they enter or maybe theyll find me
here deftly disembowelled and marked
opened by mistake

   open my grave and see the smoke that curls
about thy feet

  i was developing a marked dislike for
hafiz that old persian was distinctly
macabre then this one

   if the scent of her hair were to blow over the
place where i had lain dead an hundred years my
bones would come dancing forth from their
grave   

  then i wondered how dianes phan-
tom lover tied into the psychic-vibration
scheme of turning france upside down
now that id mulled over the felonious
assaults and successful assassination i
couldnt help but have several thoughts
concerning this exceptionally lovely diane

  the click-clack of the knocker startled
me

  qui iive i demanded

   it is i pierre came the reply
   enter with your hands in the air

  but i recognized the voice and re-
turned my pistol

  eh bien she is fixed monsieur le
prefet was reasonable

  do you mean that he swallowed that
wild tale

  mais certainement though there
was of course some talk of what in your
charming country one calls a lunacy com-
mission but in the end i prevailed

that evening pierre and i called on
the lovely livaudais
mademoiselle began pierre after
acknowledging dianes greeting you
eluded us last night but this time we
will be more vigilant

  dartois deposited a large and very
heavy suitcase on the floor

  oh but you must be planning an ex-
tended visit with all that luggage
laughed diane

  and why not monsieur landon
and i keeping you under surveillance all the
way around the clock nest-ce pas but
tell me did we disturb you last night

am i forgiven-

  and so it was you that broke my cut-
glass decanter and spilled wine all over
the rug but no i didnt hear a sound
 tis well exclaimed pierre i
would have been desolate had we awak-
ened you and i shall send you a new
decanter all filled with my own oporto
monsieur dartois youre a darling


weird tales

but how in the world am i to sleep to-
night with the both of you standing
guard staring at me as though i were a
dodo come to life

  simple enough take a bit of this
sedative it wont drug you so that you
wont hear the voice

  well why not give her a heavy shot
of it i suggested so that she wont hear
the voice at all and leave that devil be-
hind his sepulcher door chanting in vain
not at all objected pierre she
must find the way to open the door and
pass through and fulfil that which has
been impressed upon her subconscious
mind then after she has done that we
shall land like a ton of those bricks i
pierre dartois will land in person and
henceforth mademoiselle will see no
tombs by night

  then to diane it is now passably
late suppose that when you have ar-
rayed yourself in    should i most ap-
propriately say walking-costume   
take a bit of this sedative and then we
will stand guard we two

  as the door of dianes bedroom closed
i turned to ctartois

  why that suitcase its heavy as a
locomotive

  that you will understand before the
evening is over i have there various
things which i mayneed on a moments
notice though i can not say at what mo-
ment

  we are fighting an organization that
has infiltrated its members into every
stratum of society and by this time you
have no doubt that you and i are marked
and sentenced on account of our associa-
tion with diane

  we are not only contending with en-
emies skilled in armed encounter but
equally gifted in psychic conflicts wit-
ness for example how this so lovely

mademoiselle diane-

  taking my name in vain again

  diane opened the door and revealed
herself in a negligee of blue silk curiously
shot with gold i wondered that etienne
hadnt bequeathed her his chateau as well
as his house in bayonne

  but i assure you it was complimenta-
ry replied pierre and here is your
potion

  she accepted the glass sampled its con-
tents drained it stood there the smile
slowly fading from her features then
she shuddered

  these engagements with the dead   
im so glad i wont be alone tonight   
good-night messieurs

  vainly enough we wished her a good-
night also this incredible girl who could
still at times smile

  then dartois took from his suitcase a
coil of flexible insulated wire very much
like the extension cord they use to in-
crease the range of a vacuum cleaner in
addition to the lamp and reflector at one
end there was a small portable snap-
switch and a tiny globe scarcely larger
than those used as christmas tree decora-
tions this layout pierre plugged in at a
baseboard outlet a convenience which is
most unusual in bayonne

as pierre uncoiled the wire and pulled
- it along the wall i glanced again
at the chair i had occupied the night be-
fore diane had accepted pierres myth
about the shattered decanter and hadnt
noticed the scar in the bade of the chair
but that one look was enough to bring out
a sweat on me

  then i thought of the hurled knife
which had cut short the remarks of nur-
reddin

  mademoiselle from bar le due parlez
vous   i hummed as i fidgeted about

  tais-toi imbecile snapped dartois
bawdy to the last

  which of course was unjust in the ex-
treme as id spent hours trying to teach
the bride of the peacock



pierre the proper rendition of that classic

   surely she is asleep by now he con-
tinued and like you i likewise would
whistle to keep up my courage but give
me your pistol said dartois

  how come i demanded as quietly as
i could at that outrageous order

  you are no less on edge than i am
and you shoot damnably straight if by
mistake you pointed that siege gun at me
or diane you would have long regrets
and anyway we want no disturbance or
shooting the enemy cant see us though
they must know we are here and they
must not hear us

  i surrendered the pistol pierre was
right of course but with the start i made
last night i had begun to take an inter-
est in that excellent gun

  eh bien let us take our posts di-
rected pierre

  i followed him into dianes room
where he set up the reflector and lamp in
a comer so that if the circuit were com-
pleted the entire room would be illumi-
nated

   take that chair and draw it up thus
now mark well the position of mine

   pierre stood at the wall switch

  should you catch a glimpse of a very
faint bluish light dont dive for it its
just the pilot light of this lamp ive set
up in the corner as long as it glows
ill know that the    what do you call
her    the juice is on and that i can
depend on light when i need it

  ready good

  the wall switch clicked us into dark-
ness the sinister watch was on

sitting in a ladys bedroom in bayonne
does not sound so terrifying but
when the lady is awaiting summons from
the dead and when the dead sends living
envoys with keen knives it is yet again
something else

   i wondered whether id fall asleep with

my eyes open and whether dartois could
resist that damnable influence whatever
it had been

  have you ever been in morocco and
heard the drums thump-thumping in the
hills calling the tribesmen to revolt my
heart was giving a perfect imitation

  dianes breathing was soft and quiet
and normal

  silence from pierres post once in a
while i caught a passing glance of the
bluish-green pilot light as he noiselessly
shifted in his chair lucky he told me
about that light and once i heard him
draw a deep breath just a deep breath
but infinitely expressive

   it was getting dartois too not a com-
forting thought

  the clock in the cathedral chimed
twelve and then the quarter ages later
then the tension eased it is born in us
to place all diablerie at midnight and that
having passed uneventfully i felt that
nothing would happen until tomorrow
night when id be in a much better frame
of mind thoughts would be so much
more collected   

  my relief was premature

  i felt rather than heard a vibration
pulsing through the room it was as
though i watched some one beating a ket-
tle-drum at great distance getting the
rhythm by seeing the drummers body
sway to the cadence instead of actually
hearing it

   then finally the pitch increased into
the lower limits of audible vibration i
could hear it tum-tumpa-tumtum-tumpa-
tum   low and massive thundering
from across the wastes of space the
drumming of abaddon of the black
hands

  it filled the room it was an earth-
quake set to a cadence

   i heard a soft sulfurous cursing from
pierres side of the room

  then a hand on my shoulder


weird tales

  it is i the pilot light is out they
have cut the house wires we are
watched and there will be some one
sent for us

  the drumming was reaching a more re-
sonant pitch so that the walls of the room
amplified it

  diane stirred in her bed the voice
was calling her to the hidden tomb

   when i am dead open my grave and see  

   i could almost hear that sweet rich per-
sian verse as an overtone of that sonorous
drumming

  they are here whispered dartois
i can feel them

  and were in the dark

  here take this flashlight pierre
thrust it into my hand quick toward
the window

  the circle of light revealed a white-
robed intruder armed with a drawn sim-
itar

  shoot him i whispered to pierre

  no hold the light and stand
clear

  the intruder stared full and unblink-
ing into the brilliant flashlight his eyes
were sightless and staring he advanced
with the fluent slinking motion of a pan-
ther straight toward us

  then it all happened in an instant

  dartois with his chair parried the
sweeping cut of his adversarys simitar
and as he parried he sank squatting on
his left heel and simultaneously kicking
upward with his right foot

  perfect and deadly

  the enemy dropped in his tracks his
hlade fell ringing to the floor and in a
flash dartois had the simitar

  keep the light on the window cried
pierre

  the companion of the first invader
dropped fully into the circle of light
after him came a second both were
robed like the first and armed with sim-

itars and both stared sightlessly yet as
certainly as though they saw they poised
themselves like great cats gathered for the
final leap to overwhelm us

  great gol noise or no noise why
didnt dartois fire

  use your gun i croaked trying to
yell and whisper at the same time

  facing those blades empty-handed-

  christ was pierre asleep with his
eyes open as i had been the night before

   then a glittering streak from the dark-
ness at my side and the first one dropped
shorn half asunder by pierres simitar
stroke

  two grunted dartois and drew
back on his guard for an instant just out
of the beam of the light

   but before he could advance the third
leaped forward covered in his charge by
a circle of flaming hissing steel-

   clack-clack-clack

   pierre was parrying that blind assault
cut for cut parrying a desperate reckless
whirlwind of steel stroke after stroke

  then he slipped through the mill and
sank forward in a lunge

   i saw pierres blade projecting a foot
beyond his opponents back the enemy
was too close to use his simitar i picked
up a blade and struck his weapon from
his grasp lest he maul pierre to a pulp
with it since he couldnt slice him to
pieces

  but that didnt stop him he gripped
pierres shoulder and drew himself for-
ward pulling pierres blade still further
through his own body in order to close in

  i hacked again and again in a frenzy
lest that madman tear dartois to pieces
with his bare hands

   tenez gasped dartois cest fni

  he disentangled himself from the
slashed hacked body as a surgeon or
butcher id never qualify the way i man-
gle things when i hurry

  quick that first one-
the bride of the peacock



 dartois snatched the red blade from
 my hand and with a single stroke decap-
 itated the one who was rising to his knees
 and groping for his blade

 look exclaimed pierre

 diane sitting on the edge of her bed
 was slipping her feet into a pair of satin
 mules it had seemed several lifetimes
 to me from the time that dartois had
 advanced armed with a chair against the
 first intruder until he had finished the
 third but so swiftly had he worked that
 diane had scarcely time to get out of bed
 and find and don her robe and slippers

 shes on the way

 but where

 idiot she will leave the same way
 our three visitors entered look

we followed diane with the beam
of the flashlight

 she went straight toward the window
 grasped the bars and pulled herself to the
 sill

 follow her commanded pierre
 strip this one-his robe isnt bloody

 i stripped the one cleanly decapitated

 those fellows didnt drop from the
 ceiling but came down a shaft through
 the wall whose opening was concealed by
 the window-casing

 how about a turban

 this one will do wind it with the
 stained end in quick now follow
 her put that damned turban on as you
 go allezf

 diane had pulled herself up a
 glimpse of her heels and she was out of
 sight

 now my pistol

 take it but hurry ill be busy
 here-

 what

 va-t-en commanded pierre have
 i ever failed go

 i leaped to the window-sill felt and
 found a void over my head grasped the

edge and pulled myself up in spite of
our knowledge of the thick walls of these
old houses the existence of such a shaft
would never have been suspected the
flashlight revealed a narrow passage not
over ten feet long at its end was a shaft
leading down i ventured a flash down
its depth and saw a ladder leading to a
level that was well below the first floor
of the house at the bottom i turned
and faced a low archway which opened
into a passage leading straight ahead

  some twenty paces ahead of me was
diane i slopped along as fast as i could
in the loose red slippers of the enemy and
as i advanced i wound my turban as
well as i could on the march

  diane was walking with a slow almost
mechanical stride or she would have been
quite out of sight as it was i quickly
overtook her and then snapped out the
flashlight diane deep in her trance
was utterly unaware of my seizing her
robe so that she could guide me through
the darkness

  she was stepping to the cadence of
those drums

  i could distinguish now that the sound
was of many drums the roll and purr and
sputter of tiny tom-toms against a back-
ground of solemn booming that made the
masonry quiver beneath my feet yet the
source of the sound was still far away

  although the incline was not steep it
was perceptibly down-grade we were
turning ever so slowly to the left the
air was becoming damp and musty and
cool our descent must now be taking
us far beneath the uttermost foundations
of bayonne somewhere below and to
the left was the brazen door that guarded
the one who chanted in persian and in-
vited diane to a conclave of the dead that
were lonely in their deep vaults

  ahead of us was a faint glow i halted
to let diane gain a few paces and then
hugging the left wall so as to gain the


weird tales

maximum protection from the door-jamb
in case there should be a reception com-
mittee waiting i crept forward as silently
as possible

  then it occurred to me that unseeing
automatons like those that pierre had
stopped only by hacking them to pieces
would hardly be susceptible to surprize
and if more swordsmen bound in a deep
trance and directed by some master mind
to overwhelm me were waiting id have
my hands full i wondered if a pistol
would stop them  the moro jurmen-
tados down in sulu riddled with dum-
dum bullets continue their charge until
they hack to fragments the enemy who
hoped to stop them with rifle fire

  well at least those three swordsmen
had been alive and their blood was like
any other blood when spilled

  i ventured a peep around the door-
jamb the passage opened into a small
alcove which was illuminated by the red
flames of a pair of tall black candles set
one at each side of a brazen door diane
was alone before the door

  she hesitated half swaying on her feet
for a moment then knelt on the second of
the three steps that led to the door
where her fingers traced the arabesques
and scrolls embossed on the bronze the
verdigris had been worn away how
many hours had she spent in wearing the
seasoned bronze to its original color or
were there then others who sought the
same doorway and if there were when
might they appear

  evidently she was seeking the hidden
catch which would open the door the
gateway of the tomb

  surely diane needed no light to further
her quest then why these lurid candles
had they a ritualistic significance or were
they for sentries or acolytes that served
the presence behind the panel i knew
not what cross-passages i had unknowing-
ly passed in the dark and what swords-

men might be marching from any of them
swordsmen or worse   

  then diane spoke not to me but to
the dead behind the door

   im trying etienne but i cant find
the spring

  she rose from her task and retreated
turning away her eyes stared sightless-
ly at me then she wavered tottered
and retraced her steps some compelling
power was forcing her to resume her task

  i followed her and looking over her
shoulder studied the embossing her fin-
gers traced each curve each figure each
floral and foliate form that could conceal
the hidden catch she tapped fingered dug
with her nails but there was one she did
not touch and that one of all others
seemed the only one that could con-
trol the lock the center of a lotus blos-
som close to the left edge even in that
dim red light i could clearly distinguish
a line of demarcation that separated the
substance of the lotus center from the sur-
rounding metal then why didnt diane
press it why had she avoided it night
after night

   but had she avoided it

  it was smooth and polished some one
had fingered and touched it

  diane herself it all came to me the
door would not open until the presence
was ready for her arrival

  i watched her fingers working their
way back and forth over the traceries of
bronze toward the center of the lotus
blossom she was touching it-

   i took a hitch in my belt slid the sim-
itar and its scabbard back toward my hip
shifted the luger

   click

  the door yielded swinging inward on
silent hinges the drums boomed and
roared and thundered their vibrations
smote me in the face like the blast of a
typhoon an overwhelming perfume
the bride of the peacock



surged forth stifling me with its heavy
sweetness

  i leaped in ahead of diane advanced a
pace toward the blank wall before me
then wheeled to my right and saw him
who made a madness of dianes nights

he sat cross-legged on a pedestal of
carven stone his arms were crossed
on his breast he was nude save for a
yellow loin-cloth that flamed like golden
fire in the purple light of the vault his
face was emaciated and his ribs were hid-
eously prominent if he breathed it was
not deeply enough to be perceptible

  the drumming thunder ceased abrupt-
ly and the silence was more terrific than
the savage roaring pulse that had halted

  dead

  eead save for those fixed glittering
eyes that stared through and past me
but they lived fiercely with a smolder-
ing piercing intentness

  then some one stepped in between me
and the presence

  diane had followed me and standing
in front of me faced him

  like him she crossed her arms on her
breast then she advanced with slow
steps not halting until within a few paces
of the presence she knelt on the tiles
and bowed then she spoke in the ex-
pressionless voice of one who recites by
rote a speech in a foreign language he
does not understand

  etienne i am here i heard you from
across the border and i have obeyed i
have opened your grave

  i stood there like a wooden image
neither drawing my simitar to cleave that
living mummy asunder nor my pistol to
riddle him to ribbons this couldnt be
the marquis de la tour de maracq not
this blasphemy from somewhere in high
asia that might have followed the gold-
en-horde ages ago yet she had called
him etienne then he spoke

  landon it is not good that you have
meddled and entered the solitarium be-
hind the throne even the elect dare not
enter here but since you are here-

  he smiled a slow sinister smile his
long lean arm extended like the undulant
advance of a serpent

  look

  i followed his compelling gesture with
my eyes and saw the brazen door swing
slowly shut it closed with a click of om-
inous finality

  i stared for a moment too long held
by the voice and the gesture just a mo-
ment too long there was some one be-
hind me but before i could move strong
hands gripped my arms

  the presence murmured a command
my simitar and pistol and flashlight were
taken from me the hands released me
and all with such incredible swiftness that
i turned just in time to see my four mo-
mentary captors filing into an exit that
pierced the wall carrying with them my
blade and pistol as the last one cleared
the threshold a panel slid silently into
place

  i had been a splendid guardian of the
lovely girl who knelt at the feet of that
creature on the throne

  that door resumed the presence
speaking so deliberately that the moment
of my disarming was scarcely an inter-
ruption is easily opened from the out-
side by those we wish to admit

  again he smiled that slow curved smile
of menace

  he looked down at diane and spoke to
her in purring syllables she rose from
the tiles and stood there vacantly regard-
ing us dianes body devoid of dianes
spirit

  this girl and i said the presence
have a few things to discuss you will
therefore be pleased to excuse us  

  he inclined his head and smiled his
reptilian smile


weird tales

  i saw his fingers caress the carvings near
the top of the pedestal on which he sat
i leaped but too late the floor opened
beneath me as i dropped into the abys-
mal blacknesses below i caught a glimpse
of the purple light above being cut off by
the trap-door lifting back into place

  i landed on my feet with force enough
to give me fallen arches and pitched for-
ward on my face the stones were cold
and damp and slippery i rose to my
hands and knees and crept cautiously
along feeling for openings in the floor
and hoping to locate a wall which i could
follow to anywhere at all a corner or
an angle anywhere to get out of the heavy
blackness and near something that would
give me a sense of direction here there
was only up and down and neither north
south east nor west

  caged in the subcellar of this subter-
ranean vault locked in the basement of
hells private office and diane in the
hands of that animated mummy

  finally i butted head-first into a wall
the stars unfortunately werent of suf-
ficient duration to let me see where i was
so i crept along following the cold moist
stones

  my fingers touched a vertical bar one
member of a grillework which blocked
my advance i reached forward with my
other hand and grasped another bar felt
my way along right and left it was a
gate hinged to the masonry at one side
and chained shut at the other

  something tangible at last something
to grip and struggle with the gate
yielded protestingly for a few inches un-
til the chain drew taut i could feel the
heavy scale of rust and corrosion on the
links i tugged and pulled and pushed
but in vain

  then i removed my borrowed robe
folded it into a compact pad which i ap-
plied to my shoulder i backed off care-
fully measuring my retreat gathered my-

self and with a running leap charged the
gate the chain snapped the gate
opened i pitched headlong ahead of me
amid a clatter of links and the clang of
the gates crashing against the wall

  before i could regain my feet some one
landed on me

clean manly fighting may have its
place in the prize ring and possibly
even in the wrestling arena but in hells
basement it is a needless grace i shifted
just in time to avoid the unknowns knee
fouling me not to be outdone in cour-
tesy i closed in and located his eyes but
before i could apply my thumbs to the
best advantage he broke my attack
finally i backheeled him and we both
crashed to the paving luckily he ab-
sorbed the shock but it didnt stop him
he lacked the simian strength and ter-
rible arms of the assassin of the night be-
fore but he made up for it in agility and
devastating rage we both were ap-
proaching exhaustion from the fury of at-
tack defense and counter-attack

  i yielded suddenly to throw him off his
balance but i tripped on the loose piece
of chain lost my own balance and failed
to nail him as he pitched forward

  and i couldnt locate him my own
heavy breathing kept me from hearing
him i was trembling violently and my
mouth was dry as cotton and if my heart
pounded any more heavily id burst wide
open well he must be in the same
shape so i sank to the floor hoping to
catch him with a low tackle or to thwart
him in a similar maneuver on his part

  but i couldnt find him

  come here damn your hide i
frothed finally getting enough breath to
relieve my wrath

  thank god a christian panted a
voice not far from me and by your
speech an american let us be allies
what is left of us
the bride of the peacock



  and who might you be i demanded

    a prisoner like yourself lets declare
a truce and if we must fight follow me to
where there is enough light

  the fellow sounded convincing enough
his english was the meticulously correct
speech of an educated foreigner

  done lead on

  then put your hand on my shoulder
and i will lead the way he continued
to show my good faith i will let you
follow keep your head down the ma-
sonry here is low and very hard

  my enemy chuckled

  mordieu but i have been deceived
about american sportsmanship you
would have gouged my eyes out you
bit a nice morsel from my throat-apro-
pos ill show you the right way to do that
some day if we get out of here alive   
steady now on your hands and knees   
here we are

  i followed him through a low narrow
opening that had been made by prying a
few blocks of masonry out of place and
into a tiny cell illuminated with a slim
taper the ceiling was vaulted and over
a dozen feet above the floor

  this has been my grave for some
time

  he indicated the brazen panel in the
wall

   there has been entirely too much talk
of graves in the past few days i replied
graves with living occupants

  he stared at me curiously almost re-
plied then seeing me eyeing the bra-
zen panel mats non even with your
bulk and hard head you couldnt budge
that bronze it doesnt corrode and waste
away like the iron in this devils nest
well then said i how do they feed
you

  they let food down through a trap
in the ceiling look

  i looked up and saw the outline of a
trap-door

  you look strangely familiar i be-
gan ive never seen you but somehow
it is as though i had seen a portrait or
photograph or heard you compared for
likeness to some one i did once see some-
where

  no one has seen me for two years or
more but how did you run afoul of ab-
dul malaak are you also an aspirant to
the custody of the sanctuary

  he made a curious fleeting gesture
with his left hand

   hells fire monsieur i replied how
many custodians aspirant and actual does
this devil-haunted tovn hold

  then without pausing for an answer
i threw it at him

      when i am dead open my grave and see
      the smoke that curls about thy feet

  comment he exclaimed

  a home run i continued

    in my dead heart the fire still burns for thee

   yea the smoke rises from my winding-sheet

   he stared i met his stare

  que diable he finally exclaimed
who or what you are i dont know
but you know who i am de la tour de
maracq

  and i am davis landon this meet-
ing with the gentleman who has chanted
mademoiselle diane to the edge of mad-
ness is certainly a pleasure

  the marquis smiled wearily

  chanted and to what end from
your quotation of hafiz i know that she
must have heard me but she couldnt get
my thought certainly not thus far at
least so i am buried here and awaiting
the bowstring or the fire or the saw and
plank whatever abdul malaak in his
kindness orders when he has sufficiently
poisoned my friends against me i
thought a while ago that they had dis-
covered my loophole and were trying to
stop my private explorations so i gave
you a good fight-


weird tales

   for just an instant a fierce light flamed
in his eye and then that thin weary smile
again

  this is puzzling i protested i
happen to know that she did get your
message which you willed or projected
or whatever means you used every night
she wanders in her sleep to obey a sum-
mons and claws at a brazen panel-

  whats that you say demanded the
marquis wanders in obedience to my
summons wanders

  yes from your house to the door of
the room where that living mummy sits

on his pedestal-

  jsu from my house

  yes from your house which you
willed to her on your deathbed in marra-
kesh

  but monsieur i never died in mar-
rakesh

  that i can readily believe i admit-
ted but she showed me that letter from
you and a newspaper clipping announc-
ing your death and a note in arabic from
the companion of your last hours and
thus she accepted your legacy the house
on remparts de lachepaillet where she
was very conveniently situated to leave by
a secret passageway to hells front door

throughout my speech the marquis
stared at me bewildered

  i dying in marrakesh willed her that
house   

  yes damn it and hoodooed her with
strange dreams of graves to be opened
and voices chanting in persian and to-
night i followed her through the gate-
way-

  hows that followed her is she
there

  yes and that devil touched a spring
and dropped me into that dungeon before
i could say aye yes or no so you might
tell me what started her wanderings
helas monsieur what can i tell--

  when i quoted hafiz you seemed to
hear familiar words

  certainly i did chant them i also
am an adept and i chanted the verse of
hafiz for the sake of the rhythm not to
give her a command to come and release
me which she couldnt possibly do but
to ask her to communicate with nureddin
zenghi in kurdistan

  why the verse did you say what
has it to do with nureddin that is
dense to me

  pardon you are not an adept but
to put it simply it acted merely as a car-
rier wave as your radio experts would
put it it gave me a rhythm on which to
impress my thought i cant explain it
briefly but go into tibet and high
asia to hindustan among the faqirs
study at the feet of one who might still
be found sitting at the feet of a column in
the vast ruins of incredible ankor wat
speak with the priests of the eightfold
path piece all your gleanings together
and you will finally be able to project your
thoughts to one with whom you are en
rapport-if you have the strength of will
the knowledge is jealously guarded
but i found it

  had i gone further with the art i
could have projected myself from my
body and spoken to her but i couldnt
cant yet and shant live long enough
to learn how

  when i was reported dead i was
actually in this cell my enemy tricked
me in a contest of occult arts and here i
am abdul malaak    servant of
the angel as he calls himself i see it all
now he forged that letter and clipping
to get her into my house from which he
could summon her to make the trip un-
observed and his concentrated thought
aided by the circle of adepts in the great
hall overpowered my message

  but nureddin did come to town
  magnifique maybe she did send for
the bride of the peacock



him and he will take the place by as-
sault he will not fail-

  nureddin has failed

  and i told what had happened in pi-
erres study

  then we are doomed said the mar-
quis

  doomed hell i said you sug-
gested that we be allies now let me take
command is it near your feeding-time
yes so says my stomach replied
the marquis and then as he saw me
glance once more at the trap-door in the
crown of the vault even if i leaped to
your shoulders i couldnt reach it

   who said that you had to reach it i
queried

  how then demanded the marquis
they dont get close enough for you to
take the guard by surprize as he gives me
my food if they only passed it through
that door there

  i have an idea stand close to the
wall out of sight better yet back out

through that hole in the wall-

 but-

  be damned ask no questions mon-
sieur or my inspiration will leave me i
have a hunch are you with me

   to the death and to the uttermost

   i accepted the hand he extended

  and there is another pierre dar-
tois

  none better admitted the marquis
there is no love lost between us but
he will not begrudge me any help given
you and diane but even that dartois
risks his head if he dares enter

  never fear about dartois i reas-
sured the marquis but while we have
time tell me this who has the hold over
dianes mind is it you or that dried-up
thing on the pedestal

  both it seems though he is aided
by his circle of adepts with them bro-
ken up his power would be comparatively
little

  but would that release her breaking
them up and him also

  yes and i will die happy if i per-
sonally attend his breaking up into small
bits monsieur landon if we get out of
here alive i will dismember him with my
bare hands and since she has obeyed
the command she can be awakened from

the influence of the power-

  there they are now

the marquis beckoned me to be silent
in my turn i motioned him to crawl
out of sight of the trap and followed him

   quest-ceque cest muttered the mar-
quis obedient but puzzled

  wait and see

  we heard the trap open a basket was
descending at the end of a slim cord

  pull that basket up and let down a
rope that isnt heavy enough i di-
rected in arabic

  why not ya marqees queried the
voice somewhat taken aback

  this isnt el marqees ya hul i
shouted let down that rope and pull
him up hes still breathing but he wont
be when you come back with a rope
from above i heard a mutter of voices
and who are you demanded the
spokesman

  i heard the clank of arms my un-
usual request had been passed along to
the guard doubtless but as pierre said
toujours audace

  come down and see o heap of offal
one of the masters guests o eater of
pork would you argue with me

  and then aside to the marquis ive
got em going

  the marquis grinned and the fire re-
turned to his eyes

   give me your rags i continued and
well fool em proper

  just a moment ya sidi resumed the
voice while we get a strong rope
make haste then eater of unclean
food i have much else to do than to


weird tales

butcher vermght swine down here in the
cellar

   patience master said the voice

  i dug up from my memory a few ep-
ithets collected in mindanao and growled
them in return they couldnt under-
stand it and were duly impressed with
my importance by the subdued and re-
spectful murmurings they must by that
time have identified me as one of the mas-
ters pet assassins

  but the occasional tinkle of accouter-
ments and soft note of steel didnt reas-
sure me the death of the marquis and
the lifting up of his body doubtless was
of sufficient importance to detain a part
of the guard

a heavy rope several centimeters in
diameter was let down

  give me more slack pigs and fa-
thers of many little pigs how can i tie
this fellows carcass with that little and
anchor it firmly up there when you get
him up im coming after

  then to the marquis ill go first
and you follow

  no let them haul me up i cant
climb a rope he whispered

  youre a damned liar but since you
want the first crack at them go ahead
but remember you-re dead dont start
the show until i get there

  i tied a running noose and drew it up
beneath his arms

  all right up there heave away
and wait for me ill tell you what to
do with him

  they heaved away

   well i reflected ill be in a pretty
jam if something goes haywire and that
rope doesnt come down again that hot-
head-

  by the time the marquis reached the
trap i was in a sweat and a fidget

  hurry up there i roared and let

that rope down drop him anywhere
he wont hurt you

  shall we hoist you ya sahib

  let that rope down and silence ya
humar

  so far so good i had them buffaloed

  i leaped at the rope and hand over
hand pulled myself up as i approached
the opening i gripped its edge with one
hand heaved myself through and
sprawled face down on the floor

   he still breathes master said one as
he sought to help me to my feet

  i forgot my simitar give me yours
and ill tend to that

  and as i was solicitously assisted to my
knees the hilt of a blade was thrust into
my hand

  i leaped and slashed

  give em hell etienne i shouted

  and i laid about me right and left

  the marquis closed in on the one near-
est him lifted him over his head and
dashed him head-first to the tiles then
he snatched a blade from the floor and
came on guard

  the four survivors faced us dazed by
the swift turn and then they charged i
hacked and slashed clumsily and desper-
ately parried and missed my riposte
lashed out again and had my blade
dashed from my hand by a sweeping cut
etienne crouched on guard behind his
whirlwind of steel faced half to his right
saw my peril and with a dazzling snick of
his blade sliced my adversarys sword
arm half off and back again to his party

  as i booted my disabled enemy into
insensibility i marveled at the incredible
skill with which he held those three fierce
kurds at bay

  i gave my opponents head one farewell
bounce against the paving picked up his
blade and joined etienne

  gardez-vous he snapped i have
him

                    w t-
the bride of the peacock



  he slipped forward in a lunge blade
slicing upward to disembowel his adver-
sary and back on guard again with but
two to face him

  they were too dazzled by that terrific
attack to be aware of my presence thus
my neck-cut to the one on the right was
most creditable

  tenez commanded etienne as he
confronted the survivor i need him
standing as though his feet were
spiked to the floor he waved me aside
engaged his enemy parrying cut after des-
perate cut as coolly and effortlessly as
though fencing with a blunt foil instead
of with blades that sheared from shoul-
der to hip with one stroke

  the kurd fought with the savagery of
one whose doom stares him in the face
but in vain he could not crowd or
break through the hedge of steel that
etienne built with his leaping flashing
simitar

  then the kurd stood there blinking
and bewildered staring ct his empty
hand his blade clanged against the tiles
a dozen feet away

  now son of a disease throw this ref-
use into the pit and you landon strip
this fellow you kicked senseless i need
his clothes

  the survivor complied without a mur-
mur and one by one thrust the dead and
dismembered down the trap-door

  tie that pig snapped the marquis

  i obeyed using a coil of the rope with
which we had been hoisted up

  and now said the marquis tell us
several things or i will dismember you
slice by slice

  the fellow growled

  what tongue-tied well then   

but no i will not slice you to pieces-

  landon pass me that torch

  i plucked the flaming torch from its
socket in the wall etienne applied it to
the kurds feet

   w t-

  where is the girl and what is the mas-
ter doing

  the kurd writhed and groaned
speak up dungheap or ill roast you
alive

  the smell of flesh roasted before it is
dead is not pleasant

   i will speak sahib

  very well what is happening in the
throne room and what of the girl
the master sits on the high throne
the girl is as one dead awaiting the com-
mand to pass through the veils of fire to
become the bride of th peacock it is the
night of power

  the night of power    and here
we are two against a company landon
will you join me in dying like a man

  i dont relish this dying stuff any too
damned much etienne i confessed
but ill go any reasonable length with
you so lead on

  magnifique let us go--

  and then he turned

  this roasted pig here will spread no
alarm he growled as his blade de-
scended

  we thrust this last body down the trap-
door

the marquis wiped his simitar and
led the way torches illuminated
the passage until the first turn and there-
after it was lighted by an indirect glow
emanating from a molding along the
arched ceiling

  your arabic is acceptable a lot of
these fellows speak only kurdish or dia-
lects of turki but stick to your own and
all will be well and very few will
recognize me in that purple light none
in fact theyve not seen me for better
than two years and my very existence has
been forgotten except by a few jailers
there was one who evidently had not
forgotten you


weird tales

   i felt for the little peacock amulet and
found it still about my throat

  nureddin was speechless handed
it to me and coughed his life out since
he was your friend take it

  another vengeance to exact but re-
member on your life speak not the ara-
bic word for satan whoever inadvert-
ently pronounces it must then and there
be torn to pieces nor say any word re-
sembling it that would be fatal to you
and would draw attention to me

  what is yourpian

  i have none even as i had none but
an urge to explore when i wandered into
the darkness and found you this laby-
rinth is not entirely known to me keep-
er of the sanctuary before abdul malaak
but this part of it i know well enough
and our wits will do the rest

  the marquis led the way down wind-
ing passages up stairways down others
curving and twisting never once hesitat-
ing at a branch or cross passage sentries
posted at intersections saluted us perfunc-
torily and the marquis negligently re-
turned their salutes

  as we advanced i picked up the deep
booming of the drums mingled with it
was the wail of reed pipes and the whines
of single-stringed kemenjahs

  fight it said the marquis dont
let it get a hold oh you abdul malaak
sits nodding there on that tall throne im-
pressing his will on the circle of adepts
they receive and amplify it a thousand-
fold and on that a thousandfold more
increasing in geometrical progression
they have but to attune their minds to
the vibration frequency

  once i saw them project their thought
to take material form

  jugglery he scoffed

  jugglery if you will but i saw what
i saw a material entity formed in the
vortex of that resonating countlessly am-
plified thought

  but continued the marquis if you
resist it from the beginning you may hold
your own we may break it up to-
nights conclave deals with diane and
thus our escape may not be noted

  as we turned a corner crossed sim-
itars barred our progress

  etienne made a curious fleeting ges-
ture with his left hand

  the sentries raised their blades in sa-
lute and advanced us as we entered the
arched doorway of the throne room
their blades clicked behind us

a smoldering somber mist red as the
embers of a plundered city hung
in the air of that great domed hall a
heavy sweetness surged about us wave on
wave bearded adepts sat cross-legged be-
neath three-decked gilded parasols and
caressed with knuckles and finger tips and
the heels of their hands the drums of
varying sizes which they balanced on their
knees as they played they swayed in
cadence their eyes stared fixedly to the
front they were dead men driven by a
terrific will

  against the wall of the circular hall
towered a pyramid terraced in steps of
glistening black tongues of flame quiv-
ered up from orifices along the stairway
that led to the dais at the apex the dais
was canopied with gold-threaded damask
and crowned with the monstrous effigy of
a peacock tail fanned out and enameled
in natural colors

  on the dais sat the cadaverous abdul
malaak that animated mummy that was
to smite all france with the devastating
thought waves of his adepts he sat there
like a high god he nodded to the colos-
sal thunder of the drums and the whin-
ing strings and the wind instruments that
moaned of the blacknesses across the
border

  we took our places near the foot of
the pyramid so that we could see the en-
the bride of the peacock



trance which faced abdul malaak
through it filed a steady stream of dev-
otees all robed in white with scarlet
girdles from which hung simitars as
they took their places on the cinnabar-
powdered floor they caught the cadence
of the music and swayed to its rhythm
from their ranks row after row in a cres-
cent facing the throne came a hoarse
whispering which grew to a solemn chant

  acolytes marched up and down through
the ranks of the communicants swinging
fuming censers others robed in crim-
son followed them bearing copper trays
laden with small curiously shaped loz-
enges and wafers which they offered the
followers of the peacock

  the stones beneath us quivered i
could feel the world rocking on its foun-
dations that maddening music finally
spoke in a wordless language of riot and
pillage and chaos and high above the
adepts arms crossed on his breast sat
abdul malaak directing the doom

  i thought of the violin note that would
shiver a wine-glass of the rams-hom
trumpets that leveled the walls of jer-
icho it wasnt the sound it was the
thought that was in resonance the mind
of each individual hammering relentless-
ly in cadence doubling and redoubling
the sum whenever another of the circle
put himself completely in tune reso-
nance perfect timing until the hatred of
one shriveled adept from high asia
would be magnified a millionfold and on
that yet again as much more

  the air was tenanted with presences
called from over the border by that de-
mon on his tall black terraced throne
distinctly above that deep world-shaking
roll and thunder i began to hear twitter-
ings and chirpings and murmurings
they were gathering drawn by the mas-
ters resistless vortex of power we were
being hemmed in by a congress of evil in-
finitely greater than all humanity work-

ing with one thought could of itself de-
vise the puny blasphemies and petty
filthinesses of mediaeval devil-worship
were childish against this monumental
array of satanism from kurdistan

   fight it landon fight it whispered
the marquis dont let it get you or
youll join them malik tawus devised
no such evil not in kurdistan and ar-
menia where i learned the true faith to
bring it to france

  an acolyte approached with a tray of
wafers the marquis and i both accepted

  on your life dont swallow it he
cautioned palm it with that music
you couldnt stand the drug it contains

  and to think that i brought all this
into france he continued not this
tonight but paved the way for that devil
up there to get this hold his death is
more important than your life or mine
or hers even

  if nureddin were alive   

  and then look exclaimed etienne
over there

   diane arrayed in wisps of scarlet and
silver and crowned with a strange tall
head-dress that flamed and smoldered
with rubies and frosty diamonds and
glowed with great pearls lurid in that sul-
try light was escorted by acolytes toward
the steps of the pyramid

  tongues of flame now spurted waist-
high along the dais and encircled it and
the jets of flame rose taller along the steps

  pace by pace diane approached the
steep ascent of the pyramid

   she is to pass through the veil of fire
and become the bride of the peacock
whispered etienne the flames will not
hurt her body but she will be enslaved
beyond all redemption

  maybe we can make a fast break and
charge up the steps and finish abdul ma-
laak before these fellows come out of their
trance i suggested do you know of


weird tales

any way of getting away after weve done
that

  yes a door behind the throne opens
into the solitarium where he sits most of
the time in meditation on his pedestal
well then   

  the flames wont hurt her body re-
sumed the marquis but if one of us
starts up there all he has to do is to press
a small catch and the nature of the flame
will change entirely there are those who
have passed through the veil unbidden
but they didnt live long

   diane had begun the ascent

  then abdul malaak spoke in a great
voice incongruously deep for that ema-
ciated frame

  servants of malik tawus i have sum-
moned you to witness the night of power
thus far we have failed because your lips
served me while your hearts betrayed me
some of you still think of el marqees
who would not honor me and the message
i carried from across the border

  others think of nureddin who would
have kept you in kurdistan oppressed by
the moslem and worshipping the bright
angel as fugitives hidden in caverns

  but nureddin was slain in the act of
betraying us to the feringhi so that he
could liberate et marqees but i have
devised a doom for el marqees i abdul
malaak have thwarted his power and
behold she is seeking me instead of him
behold and believe and give him freely
to his doom even as his comrade in trea-
son was doomed

  we see and we believe and we give
freely came the deep response

   etienne clutched my arm

  there is but one chance i will go
first and settle with abdul malaak and
extinguish the flames you follow and
when the flames subside take diane
through the door behind the throne

  etienne leaped to his feet and three
steps up the terrace

  i followed him drawing my blade

a murmur rose from the devotees
abdul malaak stared for once dis-
concerted then he shouted a command
the swordsmen stirred in their trance
abdul malaak smote a brazen gong at the
side of the dais its deep clang touched
them to life they rose blades flashed

  two against that host of madmen
pierre had failed me and i was glad
that re had failed why should he also
die in this butchery

  abdul malaak leaned forward in his
throne his fingers found and touched
a knob and the flames rose high about
the dais fierce consuming fire

  hold them until i get abdul malaak
then take her away while i cover your
retreat shouted etienne as he passed di-
ane on the stairs

  he leaped through that deadly blind-
ing flame and at abdul malaak on his
throne

  then came a voice loud and clear above
the roar of the swordsmen nureddin
has returned nureddin with the assas-
sins knife in his chest

  i turned just two leaps from the
flame-girt dais where i had overtaken
diane and caught her in my free arm

  and nureddin it was drooping mus-
taches scar-seamed cheek and forehead a
kurd from kurdistan he flung aside
his robe a jeweled hilt gleamed from
his chest the very dagger i had seen im-
pale him in pierres study

  who will exact blood indemnity for
the death of nureddin

  he strode through the milling throng
that parted wide for him

  what must i rise from the dead to
exact the diyat o dogs and sons of dogs
have you forgotten the bread and salt of
nureddin
the bride of the peacock



  and the wave of steel that was to over-
take and overwhelm us subsided there
was an instant of silence then at the
feet of the terrace the apparition halted
faced about clutched at his chest and
wrenched the dagger free

  there came a low murmur from the
crowd

  nureddin hurled the dagger among the
dazed swordsmen

  take it and avenge nureddin

  ya nureddin shouted one

  he is our father and grandfather
  nureddin has come from the dead
  fraud and trickery shouted another
  thats no dead man

  kill the impostor

  its nureddin himself

  the adherents of nureddin were form-
ing in a cluster a simitar rose and
flashed swiftly down another and
another the friends of nureddin shoul-
der to shoulder were cutting their way
into the company their number was
growing every instant but still they were
outnumbered ten to one

  nureddin was ascending the terrace
three steps at a time he halted where i
stood simitar in my sword hand and my
free arm supporting diane

  the battle at the foot of the terrace
was waxing hotter every moment the
friends of nureddin were being forced
back toward the wall a dozen or twenty
of the enemy were charging up the terrace
to cut down the impostor and me also

  nureddin thrust at me a pair of bou-
khara saddle-bags

  i dropped my blade and took them
each of his hands emerged with an
object a little larger than a goose egg
then he tossed them one with each hand
grenades they burst full among the
enemy halting the charge with their
deadly flaming phosphorus another
grenade and yet another the assault
broke and fled howling and aflame

  and then nureddin rained his gren-
ades into the mob below

  even in this damned place of madness
i knew now that this was no dead man

  were out of fire he growled in gut-
tural arabic some high explosive
and that fierce kurd withdrawing the
safety pins and holding the grenades to
the last split second hurled them so that
they burst as they landed rending and
blasting the enemy

the friends of nureddin were now
advancing slaying-mad and fren-
zied by the fire and explosive that dead
nureddin had hurled at the enemy

  ya nureddin they shouted nu-
reddin has returned with the fires of
jehannum ya nureddin

  i glanced at the throne the terrific
searing heat had subsided and flames
were scarcely ankle-high etienne was
clambering to his feet he reeled and
tottered blood streamed from his mouth
his smile was terrible

  then he stooped picked an armful
from the throne and advanced down the
terrace toward us

i told you id do it sorry you
couldnt watch and take your lesson he
laughed as he wiped his lips look
i saw from the torn throat of his bur-
den that he had made good his boast

  then etienne with a sunreme effort
pitched the remains of abaul malaak
headlong into the bedlam below

  the kurd was hurling his last grenade
one last detonation muffled by the
bodies it blasted and seared

  etienne i demanded before we
get into that butchery release her so that
her mind will be free

  tres bien

  he turned to diane stroked her
cheeks whispered in her ear shook her


weird tales

sharply whispered again tapped her
here and there with his knuckles

  her scream was piercingly natural and
feminine diane the automaton had be-
come a woman again

  oh etienne i did find you you

werent dead after all-

  found me but not for long follow
landon out of here quick im a dead
man breathed too much of that flame
im following nureddin

  he kissed her and broke away from her
arms

  well if youre following nureddin
youre going in the wrong direction said
a calm voice at our side not in guttural
arabic but in french and heres your
pistol landon

nureddin nothing pierre dartois
stand fast fool he shouted seizing
etiennes shoulder nureddins friends
are winning and dead nureddin is
avenged

then retorted etienne as he recog-
nized pierre take diane out of here
this time i wont return to haunt her
etienne saluted us with his blade
swear not to follow me the last
will of the dead i dont want to waste

what little life is left-

  pierre stared at him for a moment and
saw that etienne spoke the truth

  you have my word

  pierres blade rose in salute and then
he turned to the throne

  oh etienne cried diane at that
moment realizing his intentions

  but etienne did not hear her

  as i followed pierre i glanced over
her shoulder and saw etienne blade flam-
ing in a great arc charge headlong into
the melee his simitar rose and fell
shearing and slashing his voice rang
exultant with slaughter then we heard
his voice no more

  i half carried half dragged diane
through the panel behind the throne into
the solhariuni of abdul malaak and
thence finally through the winding pas-
sages to dianes apartment

ell me i demanded of dartois
the next day why you ordered me
to follow diane into that den of mad-
ness

  that was an error which i didnt
recognize until after it was all over ad-
mitted pierre but since you acquitted
yourself as you did i claim a free pardon
for having unwittingly sent you to face
the keeper of the sanctuary instead of
going myself

  i had what you call the hunch he
continued it came to me in a flash that
my idea of impersonating nureddin
would succeed you understand i had
toyed with the notion from the day of his
death i knew that nureddin would have
enough of a following to divide the con-
clave if he suddenly appeared risen from
the grave

  the disguise was easy my nose is
about right by nature those scars on the
cheek and forehead and the mustaches
and the eyebrows were simple just a
few touches and the essentials were there
and that dagger-well that was one of
those flexible-bladed weapons used on the
stage in sword-swallowing acts but
convincing hem

   pierre grinned gleefully and continued
finding my way into that den was not
so difficult nureddin before his death
mentioned porte despagne i checked
against vaubans plans and then made
soundings with instruments such as pros-
pectors use in your country to locate those
oil domes my men-you saw them and
remarked that afternoon as we drove by
-found considerable subterranean cav-
ities where the plans showed none

  and since i knew enough of the rit-
the bride of the peacock



ual of malik tawus my detection as an
impostor was very improbable

  but what set you on the trail orig-
inally i asked

   etiennes letter replied pierre i
knew it for a forgery the moment i no-
ticed that it had been written by some one
who being used to arabic which is writ-
ten from right to left forgot in his care-
ful forging that etienne would cross his
ts from left to right

  alors that sufficed then i tel-
ephoned paris headquarters where they
have a file of every newspaper in the
world there was no such article in any
paper printed in morocco as the one
diane gave me

  thus i knew that some one was using
etiennes alleged death as a means of get-
ting diane into etiennes house where
memories of him would make her an easy
victim to the psychic influences that were
directed toward her

  and according to his remarks before
you two escaped from his cell the mar-
quis had also been seeking to project a
thought to her and between the two
forces-

  just a moment i interrupted why
did abdul malaak go to all the trouble of
projecting his thought to diane when a
couple of his men could have seized and
dragged her down there why bother to
prepare the stage setting of etiennes
death just oriental indirectness

  not at all dont you see ex-
plained pierre that they wanted not
merely diane in person they wanted her
as a slave of the will of abdul malaak
and when she had succumbed to his will
sufficiently to begin her nocturnal wan-
derings and pick her way to the door he

would know that she was truly in his
power and ready for the next step be-
coming an automaton whose activities as
a spy could be controlled no matter where
she went

  but grace a dieu-with certain credit
to pierre dartois-mademoiselle dianes
mind is freed not only by the death of
etienne and abdul malaak but also by
having obeyed the command which had
been impressed so firmly on her subcon-
scious mind

  and therefore tnon vieux he con-
tinued since she is done for ever with
opening graves in her sleep you must
during the remainder of your stay in ba-
yonne divert her mind from those grue-
some memories so out of my sight for
the evening i have work to attend to
allez and thus on that and on other
evenings  sought diane with more con-
fidence than i had any right to have   

 q omehow said diane one night as
 we sat on the tall gray wall of lache-
paillet watching the moon-silvered mists
rise from the moat and roll into the park
far below that moments meeting with
etienne was so unreal it was as if hed
appeared from the dead to put my mind
at rest rather than that he was actually
alive in a way he died two years ago
instead of on that mad terrible night   
not a fresh grief but the calming of an
old sorrow  if you know what i
mean-

  and then and there as pierre would
put it i had the hunch

  you mean said i that the bride of
the peacock could be pleased with a much
less colorful bird

  which was precisely what diane had in
mind

the story of a dread menace to mankind on the long-lost plateau of sung

  the extraordinary paper now for the
first time published below was found
among the private documents of the late
eric marsh whose death followed so sud-
denly upon his return from that mysteri-
ous expedition into burma from which
only he returned alive almost three dec-
ades ago

                                            



if there ever be a reader to this my
first and only word on that matter
which has robbed me of all hope of
security in this world i ask him only to
read what i have written and then if he
is incredulous to go himself to that moun-
tainous expanse of burma deep in its
most secret places and see there the wreck
of the greenstone city in the center of the
lake of dread on the long-lost plateau of
sung and if he is not yet satisfied to go
to the village of bangka in the province
of shan-si and ask for the philosopher and
scientist doctor fo-lan once far-famed
among the scholars of the world and now
lost to them of his own volition doctor
fo-lan may tell what i will not for i
write in the hope of forgetting i want to
put away from me for all time the things
that i chronicle in this document

well within the memory of my genera-
tion the hawks expedition set out for the
little-explored secret fastnesses of burma
in all the newspapers of the world was


announced not three months after the set-
ting-out from new york the tragic end of
that expedition in the files of any news-
paper may be found the story of how the
expedition was attacked by what were ap-
parently bandits and killed to the last
man mercilessly and brutally the party
looted and the bodies left exposed to the
hot unwavering rays of the burma sun
in most chronicles there were two addi-
tional details-the first telling of the dis-
covery of the body of a native guide about
a mile or more from the scene of the
ghastly slaughter and the second of the
utter disappearance of eric marsh student
and assistant to geoffrey hawks famed
explorer and scholar whose life was lost
in the unfortunate burmese expedition

  i am eric marsh my return was chron-
icled almost a month later less sensation-
ally for which i am grateful yet while
these papers state the manner in which i
found my way once more into civilization
they laugh at me a little when they say i
will not talk and condole with me a little
less when they say that my mind is no
longer sound perhaps my mind has been
affected i can no longer judge

  it is with the events of that period be-
tween the murderous attack on the hawks
expedition and my own return to the
known world with which this document
is concerned of the beginning i need
tell little for the very curious there are
the easily obtained periodical accounts
the lair of the star-spawn



let me only say at the outset that our at-
tackers were not bandits on the con-
trary they were a horde of little men the
tallest of them no more than four feet
with singularly small eyes set deep in
dome-like hairless heads these queer
attackers fell upon the party and had
killed men and animals with their bright
swords almost before our men could ex-
tract their weapons

  my own escape occurred only through
the merest chance it had so happened
that my superior hawks had somehow
lost his compass case which he always
carried at his side we had been travel-
ling no more than two hours that morn-
ing and he knew that the case had been

at his belt when we started some one had
to go back for the compasses were indis-
pensable to us we looked to one of the
natives to return quickly along the trail
but to our surprize every native we had
with us refused point-blank to return
alone a strange uneasiness had been cur-
rent among them for all of the last day
ever since we had come within sight of the
range of high hills where lay the so-called
lost plateau of sung it is true that
strange legends had reached us even be-
fore we had left ho-nan province of a
weird race of little people to whom the
natives applied the odd name tcho-
tcho supposedly living near or on the
plateau of sung indeed it had been our

 am doctor fo-lani he said


weird tales

intention to pry into these legends if pos-
sible despite the reticence and obvious feat
of the natives who looked upon the lost
plateau as a place of evil

  annoyed at this delay and yet desirous
of pushing on hawks was not favorable
toward the plan that we all return and in
the end i volunteered to cover the distance
myself while the party went on more slow-
ly until my return i found the case of
compasses without trouble lying in the
center of our trail only five miles back
and veered my mount to rejoin the party
a mile away i heard their screams and
the few shots they were enabled to fire
at the moment i was screened from view
of the party by a low mound on which
grew short bushes i stopped the horse
and dropped to the ground i crawled
slowly up the slope and looked across the
flat land beyond to where the party was
being massacred through my glasses i
saw that the attackers outnumbered the
party by at least four to one that they had
had a great advantage for they had
evidently attacked just as the party was
stringing out to enter a defile at the base
of the range of high hills beyond i re-
alized at once that i could do nothing to
help consequently i remained hidden
until the strange little men had vanished
then i rode cautiously forward to the scene
of the carnage

  i found there only dead bodies no liv-
ing thing had been left behind the cav-
alcade i discovered at once had been
plundered but fortunately for me the
marauders had taken neither food nor
water contenting themselves curiously
enough with our plans and implements
thus i was without even a shovel with
which i might have given my companions
something like a burial

there was nothing left for me to do
but to return to civilization i could
not go on alone consequently i took as

many canteens of water and packets of
food as i could carry on my horse and
started away

  i had one of two routes of return open
to me either i could go back the way we
had come and risk death on the long
journey over uninhabited land or i could
forge ahead and cross the plateau and the
high hills for i knew that uninhabited

land lay immediately beyond the range be-
fore me the distance beyond the range
was less than half that which i would have
to recover were i to retrace the partys
course yet it was an unknown route
and there was danger of again encounter-
ing the little people whose ruthlessness i
had witnessed the factor that finally de-
cided me was the still flowering hope that
i might by some accident stumble upon
the ruins of the forgotten city of alaozar
which century-old legends traced to the
plateau before me accordingly i went
ahead

  i had not gone far following as best i
could the direction the compass indicated
when i heard a low call a little to my left
i pulled up my horse to listen it came
again half call half moan dismount-
ing i walked to the spot and there i
found the native whom the journals have
mentioned as having made his way from
the scene of the massacre he was badly
wounded in the abdomen by the same
blades that had killed my companions
and he was obviously near death i knelt
beside him and raised his agonized body
in my arms

  his eyes flashed recognition and he
stared up into my face as memory returned
to him and unutterable horror crossed his
features tcho-tcho he muttered
little men-from lake of dread   
walled city

  i felt his body go limp in my arms and
looking into his face i thought him dead
i took his wrist in my hand and felt no
pulse laying him carefully on the
the lair of the star-spawn



ground i started away from him as i
walked through the low underbrush a call
much weaker than the first caused me to
turn abruptly the native was still lying
on the ground but his head was slightly
raised with what must have been a tre-
mendous effort and one arm pointed
weakly in the direction of the hills ahead

  not there he rasped not  to
   hills then he fell back shudder-
ing and lay still

  for a moment i was disconcerted but
i could not afford to ponder his warning
i went on toiling all afternoon up that
ever-steepening slope before me through
almost impassable defiles and up sheer
walls occasional trees low stunted
growths grew from the brush and waste-
land but these impeded my progress not
at all

  when i reached the crest of the range
the sun was setting looking into the red
blaze that tinted the desolate expanse be-
fore me the monotonous uninhabited
waste of unknown burma my mind re-
verted to the fate of my companions and
my own plight grief mingled with fear
of the oncoming night but suddenly i
started was it the sun in my eyes that
created the strange sight which grew out
of the wasteland far ahead on the plateau
of sung but as i continued to stare
ahead the moving red before my eyes
dimmed away and i knew that what i saw
existed was no illusion no fantasm far
away across the plateau on whose very
edge i stood rose a grove of tall trees and
beyond the trees yet set in their midst i
saw the walls and parapets of a city red
in the glare of the dying sun rising alone
in the plateau like a single monument in
a burial ground i hardly dared believe
what my mind thrust forward yet there
was no alternative-before me lay the
long-lost city of alaozar the shunned
dead city which for centuries had figured

in the tales and legends of frightened na-
tives

  whether the city stood on an island and
was surrounded by water-the lake of
dread-as natives also believed i could
not tell for it was at least five miles away
at a spot which i estimated should be the
center of the plateau of sung in the
morning i would venture there and go
alone into the city deserted for centuries
by men the sun threw its last long rays
over the waste expanse even as i looked
toward the fabled city of burma and the
shadows of dusk crept upon the plateau
the city faded from sight

i hobbled my horse in a near-by spot
where a reddish-brown grass grew
gave it as much of the water as i could
spare and prepared for the night i did
not sit long in the glow of my fire for i
was tired after my long climb and sleep
would wipe away or make less real the
memory of my dead friends and the haunt-
ing fear of danger but when i lay down
under the star-filled sky i fell asleep not
amid dreams of those dead but of others
-those who had gone from alaozar the
shunned and unknown

  how long i slept i can not say i awoke
suddenly almost at once alert feeling that
i was no longer alone my horse was
whinnying uncannily then as my eyes
became accustomed to the star-swept dark-
ness i saw something that brought all my
senses to focus far ahead of me against
the sky i saw a faint white line flame-like
wavering up up into the sky toward the
distant stars it was like a living thing
like an electrical discharge surging always
upward and it came from somewhere
on the plateau before me abruptly i
sat up the white line came from the
earth far ahead of me in the spot where

i	had seen the city in the trees or close
beside it

  then as i looked something happened


weird tales

to distract my attention from the light a
moving shadow crossed my vision and for
an instant blotted out the wavering line
ahead at the same moment my horse
neighed suddenly wildly and shied away
tearing at the rope which held him there
was some one close to me-man or an-
imal i could not tell

  even as i started to rise to my feet
something struck me a crushing blow on
the back of my head the last thing i
knew was a faint far-away knowledge
that around me there was suddenly the
sound of many little feet pattering press-
ing close to me then i sank into black-
ness



  awoke in a bed

     when last i had lain down to sleep
on the plateau of sung i know i had been
over a days journey from even the rough-
est native mats yet i awoke in a bed and
instinctively i knew that only a compara-
tively short time had passed since the
mysterious attack made on me

  for some moments i lay perfectly still
not knowing what danger might lurk near
me then i essayed to move about
there was still a sharp pain in my head
i put up my hand to feel the wound i
felt sure must be there-and encountered
a bandage my exploring fingers told me
that it was not only a skilful bandage but
also a thoroughly done job yet i could
not have been taken out of the secret fast-
nesses of burma in such a short time
could not have been moved to civilization

  but my ruminations were cut short for
abruptly a door opened into the room and
a light entered i say a light entered for
that is exactly the impression i got it was
an ordinary lamp and it seemed to float
along without human guidance but as it
came closer i saw that it was held aloft
by a very little man certainly of that same
company which had only so recently slain

the men and animals of the hawks ex-
pedition the creature advanced solemn-
ly and put the lamp which gave off a
weird green light on a stone table near
the bed in which i lay then i saw some-
thing else

  in my amazement i had failed to notice
the man who walked behind the creature
carrying the lamp now when the little
man bowed suddenly in his direction and
scurried away closing the door of the
room behind him i saw what in propor-
tion to my first visitor seemed a giant
yet the man was in reality only slightly
over six feet in height

  he stood at the side of my bed looking
down at me in the glow of the green
lamp he was a chinaman already well
past middle age his green-white face
seemed to leap out from the black of his
gown and his white hands with their
long delicate fingers seemed to hang in
black space on his head he wore a black
skull-cap from beneath the rim of which
projected a few straggling white hairs

  for a few moments he stood looking
down at me in silence then he spoke
and to my astonishment addressed me in
flawless english

  how do you feel now eric marsh
the voice was soft sibilant pleasant
the man i felt was a doctor i looked at
him more intently seeking to draw him
closer there was something alarmingly
familiar about his face

  i feel better i said there is still
slight pain the man offered no com-
ment and i went on after a brief pause
can you tell me where i am how you
know my name

  my strange visitor closed his eyes re-
flectively for a moment then again came
his soft voice your baggage is here it
identifies you he paused then he said
as to where you are perhaps if i told
you you would not know you are in the
city of alaozar on the plateau of sung
the lair of the star-spawn



  yes that was the explanation i was in
the lost city and it was not deserted per-
haps i should have guessed that the
strange little people had come from this
silent city i said i know abruptly as
i looked at the impassive face above me a
memory returned doctor i said you
remind me of a certain dead man

  his eyes gazed kindly at me then he
looked away closing his eyes dreamily i
had not hoped that any one might remem-
ber he murmured yet  of whom
do i remind you eric marsh

  of doctor fo-lan who was murdered
at his home in peiping a few years ago
he nodded almost imperceptibly
doctor fo-lan was not murdered eric
marsh his brother was left there in his
stead but he was kidnapped and taken
from the world i am doctor fo-lan
these little people i murmured
they took you i thought for a fleeting
instant of his standing among them
then you are not their leader

  the suggestion of a smile haunted fo-
lans lips leader he repeated no
i am their servant i serve the tcho-tcho
people in one of the most diabolic
schemes ever formulated on the face of
the earth

  the astonished questions that came to
my lips were abruptly quieted by the si-
lent opening of the door and the entrance
of two of the tcho-tcho people at the
same moment doctor fo-lan said as if
nothing had happened you will rest
until tonight then we will walk about
alaozar this has been arranged for you
one of the little people spoke crisply
in a language i did not understand i did
however catch the name fo-lan the
doctor turned without a further word
and left the room and the two tcho-tcho
people followed him

  presently the door opened once more
and food and drink were brought me

from that time until fo-lan returned at
dusk i was not interrupted again

the short walk in the streets of alao-
zar which followed fascinated me
fo-lan led me first to his apartments
which were not far from the room in
which i had spent the day and there al-
lowed me to look out over the city and to
the plateau beyond i saw at once that the
walled city was indeed on an island in the
midst of a lake the surface of which was
covered by heavy moving mists present
i was informed all day long despite the
burning sun the water where it could be
seen was green-black the same strange
color of the ancient masonry that made up
the city of alaozar

  fo-lan at my side said not without
base do ancient legends of china speak of
the long-lost city on the isle of the stars
in the lake of dread

  why do they call it the isle of the
stars i asked looking curiously at fo-
lan

  the doctors expression was inscrut-
able he hesitated before answering but
finally spoke because long before the
time of man strange beings from the stars
-from rigel betelgeuze-the stars in
orion lived here and some of them-
live here yet

   i was nonplussed at the intensity of his
voice and then i did not understand did
not dream of his meaning what do
you mean i asked

  he made a vague gesture with his
hands and with his eyes bade me be cau-
tious you were saved from death only
so that you might help me fo-lan said
and i eric marsh have for years been
helping these little people directing them
to penetrate the deep and unknown cav-
erns beneath the lake of dread and the
surrounding plateau of sung where lloi-
gor and zliar ancient evil ones and their


weird tales

minions await the day when they can once
more sweep over the earth to bring death
and destruction and incredible age-old
evil

  i shuddered and despite its monstrous
and unbelievable implications i felt truth
in fo-lans amazing statement yet i said
you do not speak like a scientist
doctor

  he gave a curt brittle laugh no he
replied not as you understand a scien-
tist but what i knew before i came to this
place is small in comparison to what i
learned here and the science that men in
the outer world know even now is noth-
ing but a childs mental play hasnt it
sometimes occurred to you that after all
we may be the playthings of intelligences
so vast that we are unable to conceive
them

  fo-lan made a slight gesture of annoy-
ance and silenced the protest on my lips
with a sign then we began the descent
into the streets only when i was outside
standing in the narrow streets scarcely
wide enough for four men walking
abreast did i realize that fo-lans apart-
ment was in the highest tower in aloazar
to which indeed the other turrets were
very small in comparison there were few
high buildings most of them crouching
low on the ground the city was very
small and took up most of the island
save for a very inconsiderable fringe of
land just beyond the ancient walls on
which grew the trees i had seen at sunset
the day before trees which i now noticed
were different from any others i had ever
seen having a strange reddish-green foli-
age and green-black trunks the sibilant
whispering of their curious leaves accom-
panied us in our short walk and it was
not until we were once more in fo-lans
apartment that i remembered there had
been no wind of any kind yet the leaves
had moved continually then too i re-

marked upon the scarcity of the tcho-
tcho people

  there are not many of them fo-lan
said but they are powerful in their own
way yet there are curious lapses in their
intelligence yesterday for instance after
spying your party from the top of this
tower and after going out and annihilat-
ing it they returned with two of their
number dead they had been shot the
tcho-tcho people could not believe them
dead since it is impossible for them to
conceive of such a weapon as a gun at
base they are a very simple people yet
they are inherently malevolent for they
know that they are working for the de-
struction of all that is good in the world

  i do not quite understand i said

  i can feel that you do not believe in
this monstrous fable fo-lan replied
how can i explain it to you you are
bound by conventions long established
yet i will try perhaps you wish to think
that it is all a legend but i will offer you
tangible proof that there is more than
legend here

itons ag a strange race of elder be-
s-j ings lived on earth the came from
rigel and betelgeuze to take up their
abode here and upon other planets but
they were followed by those who had
been their slaves on the stars those who
had set up opposition to the elder ones-
the evil followers of cthulhu hastur the
unspeakable lloigor and zhar the twin
obscenities and others the ancient
ones fought these evil beings for posses-
sion of the earth and after many cen-
turies they conquered hastur fled into
outer space but cthulhu was banished to
the lost sea kingdom of rlyeh while
lloigor and zhar were buried alive deep
in the inner fastnesses of asia-beneath
the accursed plateau of sung

  then the old ones the elder gods
returned to the stars of orion leaving be-
the lair of the star-spawn



hind them ever-damned cthulhu lloigor
zhar and others but the evil ones left
seeds on the plateau on the island in the
lake of dread which the old ones
caused to be put there and from these
seeds have sprung the tcho-tcho people
the spawn of elder evil and now these
people await the day when lloigor and
zhar will rise again and sweep over all
the earth

  i had to summon all my restraint to
keep from shrieking my disbelief aloud
after some hesitation i forced myself to
say in as calm a voice as i could assume
what you have told me is impossible
fo-lan

  fo-lan smiled wearily he moved
closer to me put his hand gently on my
arm and said have they never taught
you eric marsh that there lives no man
who may say what is possible and what
not what i have told you is true it is
impossible only because you are incapable
of thinking of this earth in any terms but
those suggested by the little science the
outer world knows

  i felt myself rebuked and i must
help you raise these dead things pene-
trate the subterranean caverns below alao-
zar and bring up the creatures that lie
there to destroy the earth i asked in-
credulously

  fo-lan looked at me impassively then
his voice sank to a whisper and he said
yes   and no the tcho-tcho people
believe you will help me to raise them
and so they must continue to believe but
you and i eric marsh    you and i are
going to destroy the things below

  i was bewildered for a moment i en-
tertained the idea that my companion was
mad two of us-against a host of crea-
tures and the tcho-tcho people-and our
only weapon my gun wherever that is

  fo-lan shook his head you antici-
pate me you and i will be but the instru-

ments through us the things below will
die

  you are speaking in riddles doctor
i said

  nightly for many months i have tried
to call for help with the force of my
mind have tried to get through the cos-
mos to those who alone can help in the
titanic struggle before us last night i
found a way and soon i myself will go
forth and demand the assistance we
need

  still i do not understand i said
fo-lan closed his eyes for a moment
then he said you do not want to un-
derstand me or you are afraid to i am
suggesting that by telepathy i will sum-
mon help from those who first fought the
things imprisoned below us

  there exists no proof of telepathy
doctor

   it was a foolish thing to say as fo-lan
immediately pointed out to me he
smiled a little scornfully try to throw
off your shackles eric marsh you come
to a place you did not know existed and
you see things which are to you impos-
sible yet you seek to deny something so
close and conceivable as telepathy

  im sorry i said im afraid im
not going to be much of a help to you
how am i to help you and how will
you go forth

  you are to watch over my body when
i travel upward to seek the help of those
above

  dimly intelligence began to come to
me last night i murmured out there
on the plateau i saw a white line waver-
ing into the sky

  fo-lan nodded that was the way
he said made visible by the power of
my desire soon i shall travel it

  i leaned forward eagerly wanting to
ask him a score of questions but fo-lan
held up his hand for silence have you


weird tales

heard nothing eric marsh he said all
this while it has been growing

  the moment fo-lan mentioned it i
realized that i had heard something had
been hearing it ever since we had re-
entered the doctors apartment it was a
low humming a disturbing sound as of
a chant which seemed to well up from
far below and yet seemed equally present
from all sides and at the same time i
was conscious of a distinct atmospheric
change something which fo-lan did not
perhaps notice since he had been here
now for years it was a growing tension
a pressing feverish tension in the chill
night air slowly there grew in me a feel-
ing of great fear the very air i felt was
noxious with cosmic evil

  what is it i murmured

  fo-lan did not answer he appeared
to be listening intently to the chant or
humming sound mounting from below
smiling to himself then he looked
cryptically at me and abruptly stepped to
the outer wall there he pulled hard at
one of the ancient stones in the wall and
in a moment a large section of the wall
swung slowly inward revealing a dark
passage beyond a secret way leading
downward fo-lan came swiftly back to-
ward me taking up one of the little green
lamps with which j had once before come
in contact and lighting it as he spoke to
me

  i have not been idle in these past
years i fashioned that way myself and
only i know of it come eric marsh i
will show you what no tcho-tcho sus-
pects i have ever seen what will silence
all protestor disbelief in you

the stairs which i found myself de-
scending in a few moments led
downward along the round wall of a
shaft that pierced the earth down
down we went feeling the walls on both
sides of us with our hands fo-lan car-

ried the lamp in one hand and its green-
ish glow served as illumination for our
perilous journey for the steps were un-
even and steep as we descended the
sounds from below grew noticeably
louder now the humming sound was
frequently cut into by another the sound
of many voices murmuring together in
some long-forgotten language

  then abruptly fo-lan stopped he
gave the lamp to me and with a brief
caution to me not to speak gave his atten-
tion to the wall before him raising the
lamp above my head i saw that the stone
steps went no farther that we were in
fact within two feet of solid masonry
suddenly fo-lan  reached back and ex-
tinguished the light and at the same time
i was conscious of an opening in the wall
before us where fo-lan had moved aside
an old stone look down and with care
he whispered then he stepped aside
and i peered downward

  i looked into a gigantic cavern illumi-
nated by a huge green lamp seemingly
suspended in space and by at least a hun-
dred smaller ones the first thing that
caught my eye was the horde of tcho-
tcho people prostrate on the floor it was
from them that the low murmuring sound
was coming then i saw an upright fig-
ure among them it was that of a tcho-
tcho man slightly taller than the others
i thought disfigured by a hump on his
back and incredibly old he was stalking
slowly forward supported by a crooked
black stick behind me fo-lan noticing
the direction of my glance murmured
that is e-poh leader of the tcho-tcho
people he is seven thousand years old
i could not help turning in utter surprize
fo-lan motioned forward you have
seen nothing look beyond them beyond
e-poh in the half-darkness forward but
do not cry out

  my gaze swept those prostrate figures
passed beyond e-poh and began to ex-

                     w t-
the lair of the star-spawn



plore the dusk beyond i think i must
have been looking for some moments at
the thing that crouched there before i
actually realized it that was because the
creature was so large i hesitate to write
of it for i can blame no one for not be-
lieving me yet it was there i saw it
first because my gaze fixed upon the green
gleaming from its eyes then abruptly i
saw it entirely i thank providence that
the light was not strong that only its
vaguest outlines were clear to me and i
regret only that my innate doubt of fo-
lans strange story made the shock of this
revelation accordingly sharper

  for the thing that crouched in the
weird green dusk was a living mass of
shuddering horror a ghastly mountain of
sensate quivering flesh whose tentacles
far-flung in the dim reaches of the subter-
ranean cavern emitted a strange hum-
ming sound while from th depths of the
creatures body came a weird and horrific
ululation then i fell back into fo-lans
arms my mouth opened to cry out but
i felt the doctors firm hand clapped across
my lips and from a great distance i
seemed to hear his voice

   that is lloigor



o-lans story was true

  i found myself suddenly in fo-
lans apartment i know i must have
climbed the long winding steps but i do
not remember climbing them for the
tumultuous thoughts that troubled me
and the hideous memory of the thing i
had seen served to drive from my mind
all consciousness of what i was doing

  fo-lan came quickly away from the
wall and stood before me his face trium-
phant in the green lamplight for three
years i have helped them penetrate into
the earth into the caverns below have
helped them in their evil purpose now i
w t-

  shall destroy and my dead brother will
be avenged he spoke with an intensity
i had not imagined him capable of

  he did not wait for any comment from
me passing beyond me he put the lamp
down on a small table near the door
then he went into the bedroom and lk
another lamp i saw its green light on the
wall as he came once more into the room
where i stood

  mind said fo-lan as he stood be-
fore me is all-powerful mind is every-
thing eric marsh this evening you saw
things of which you hesitated to speak
even before you saw the thing in the cav-
ern below-lloigor you saw leaves
move on trees-and they moved by the
power of evil intelligences far below
them deep in the earth-a living proof of
the existence of lloigor and zhar

  e-poh has a mind of great power but
the knowledge i have endows me with
greater power despite his tremendous age
long hours i have sought to penetrate
cosmic space and so powerful has my
mind become that even you could see the
thought-thread that wavered upward from
alaozar last night and mind eric
marsh exists independent of body

   i will wait no longer tonight i will
go forth now while the worship is in
progress and you must watch my body

   colossal as his plan was i could only
believe what i had seen during the short
space of my visit was unbelievable impos-
sible yet was

  fo-lan continued my body will rest
on the bed in the chamber beyond but my
mind will go where i wish it with a speed
incomparable to anything we know i will
think myself on rigel and i shall be
there you must watch that none disturbs
my body while i am gone it will not be
long

  fo-lan drew from his voluminous robe
a small pistol which i recognized im-
mediately as one i had been carrying in


weird tales

my pack you will kill any one who
tries to enter eric marsh

  beckoning me to follow him fo-lan
led the way into his chamber and despite
my feeble protest stretched himself on the
bed almost at once his body went rigid
and at the same moment i saw a gray out-
line of fo-lan standing before me a
smile on his thin lips his eyes turned up-
ward then he was gone and i was alone
with his body

for over an hour i sat in fo-lans apart-
ment my terror mounting with each
second only in that hour was i capable
of approaching in my thoughts the cata-
clysmic horror which confronted the
world if fo-lan was unsuccessful in his
daring quest once too while i sat there
pattering footsteps halted beyond the
outer door then to my unspeakable re-
lief passed on toward the end of my
watch the abrupt cessation of the chant-
ing sounds from below followed by the
noises of movement throughout the island
city indicated that the worship was over
then for the first time i left the chamber
to take up my position at the outer door
where i stood gun in hand waiting for
the interruptions my terrified mind told
me must come

  but i never had cause to use the wea-
pon for suddenly i heard the sound of
feet behind me i whirled-and saw fo-
lan he had returned he stood quietly
listening then he nodded to himself and
said we must leave alaozar eric
marsh alone we can not do it and we
have little time to waste we must see
e-poh and have his permission to go be-
yond to the plateau of sung

 fo-lan moved forward now and
tugged at a long rope which hung quite
near me along the wall from somewhere
far below there came the abrupt clang of
a gong once more fo-lan pulled the
rope and again the gong sounded

  that is to inform e-poh that i must
speak to him about an urgent matter-
concerning the things below

  and your quest i asked has it
been successful

  he smiled wryly it will be successful
only if i can convince e-poh to open the
way for lloigor and zhar and their count-
less hordes tonight-now the way must
be open otherwise even the star-warriors
are helpless to penetrate earth

  the sound of running feet in the cor-
ridor cut short my questions the door
opened inward and on the threshold i saw
two of the tcho-tcho people dressed in
long green robes and wearing on their
foreheads curious five-pointed star-
designs they ignored me completely ad-
dressing themselves to fo-lan a rapid
conversation in their strange language fol-
lowed and in a moment the two little
people turned to lead the way

  fo-lan started after them motioning
me to follow from e-poh he whis-
pered then he added in a quick voice
be careful and speak no english before
e-poh for he understands it also be
certain you still have the gun for e-poh
will not let us go beyond alaozar without
an escort and those little people you and
i will have to kill

  we went rapidly down the corridor
and after a long descent found ourselves
on the street level and deep in the tower
at last we entered an apartment similar
in many respects to fo-lans but neither
so small nor so civilized in its aspect
there we confronted e-poh surrounded
by a group of little people dressed simi-
larly to our guides fo-lan bowed low
and i did the same under the stress of
those curious little eyes turned on me

  e-poh was seated on a sort of raised
dais suggestive of his leadership but be-
yond the evidence of his great age in his
lined face and his withered hands and
the servile attitude of the tcho-tcho peo-
the lair of the star-spawn



pie neaf him there was no indication that
he was the ruler of the little people
around usi

  e-poh said fo-lan speaking in
english for my benefit i have had intel-
ligence from those below

  e-poh dosed his eyes slowly saying in
a strange whistling voice and this in-
telligence-what is it fo-lan

  fo-lan chose to ignore his question
lloigor and zhar themselves have spok-
en to my mind he said

  e-poh opened his eyes and looked at
the doctor in disbelief even to me zhar
has never spoken fo-lan how can it
be that he has spoken to you

  because i have fashioned the way
mine have been the hands that groped be-
low and found lloigor and those others
zhar is greater than lloigor and of
greater age and his word is law to those
below

  and what has zhar communicated to
you fo-lan

  it is written below that tonight is the
time when the buried ones wish to come
forth and it is decreed that the servants
of e-poh must go beyond alaozar beyond
the lake of dread to the plateau of sung
there to await the comihg of the old ones
from below

  e-poh peered intently at fo-lan his
perplexity evident tonight i spoke long
with lloigor- it is strange that he told me
nothing of this plan fo-lan

  fo-lan bowed again that is because
the decision is zhars and of this lloigor
did not know until now

  and it is strange that the old ones
did not address themselves to me

  for a moment fo-lan hesitated then
he said that is because zhar wishes me
to go beyond alaozar to address those be-
low sung while e-poh and his people
must summon the gods below from the
towers and house-tops of alaozar when
lloigor and zhar have come above the

lake of dread then eric marsh and i
must return to alaozar to plan for them
the way beyond into the outer world
e-poh pondered this statement in me
uneasiness was beginning to grow when
at last the tcho-tcho leader said it will
be as you wish fo-lan but four of my
people must go with you and the amer-
ican

  fo-lan bowed it is pleasing to me
that four others accompany us but it is
necessary also for us to take with us food
and water for there is no way of telling
how many hours it may take the old
ones to rise from below

  e-poh acquiesced without question
within a half-hour the six of us found
ourselves pushing off the isle of the stars
into the lake of dread heavily shrouded
in thick mists which gave off a strange
putrescent odor the barge-like boat in
which we rode was strangely suggestive
of ancient roman galleys yet very differ
ent the tcho-tcho people sculled their
way across the lake and in a few moments
we had reached the opposite shore and
were pushing rapidly across the plateau
of sung

we had not gone far when from be-
hind us came a weird whistling
call then another and anotfier and finally
a ghastly assembly was piping weirdly
from the towers of alaozar and from
below there came suddenly the terrifying
sound of movements under the earth

  they have opened the vast caverns be
low the city murmured fo-lan and
they are calling forth lloigor and zhar
and those below them

  then fo-lan looked swiftly around
calculating the distance we had covered
abruptly he turned to me whispering
give me the gun they will not hear in
the city

  silently i handed the doctor the wea-
pon and following his sign backed away


weird tales

sharply the sound of the first shot cut into
the night immediately after a second
shot rang out two of our little com-
panions were dead but the other two
seeing what had happened to their com-
panions and sensing their own fate
jumped nimbly away drawing their sharp
little two-edged swords then together
they came at fo-lan the revolver spat
again and one of them went down claw-
ing wildly at the air but the last of them
came on-and the revolver jammed

  fo-lan leaped aside at the same in-
stant that i flung myself forward falling
on the tcho-tcho man from behind the
force of my attack caused him to drop the
weapon he held in his hand and i
thought for a moment that his death was
certain but i had reckoned without his
strength he whirled at once catching me
unaware and with the greatest ease flung
me five feet from him but this short
pause had been sufficient for fo-lan
darting forward he seized the weapon the
tcho-tcho man had dropped then just
as the little man turned fo-lan plunged
the weapon into his body he dropped
instantly

  i staggered to my feet bruised from
the shock of being thrown to the ground
with such force i had not imagined that
these little men could be so powerful de-
spite fo-lans early wacnipg fo-lan was
standing quite still an almost ecstatic
smile on his face i looked at him and
opened my lips to speak-and then a
movement far behind him caught my eye
at the same instant fo-lan turned

  far up in the sky a brilliant beam of
light was growing-and it did not come
from the earth then suddenly so swiftly
the light grew the surrounding country
was as light as day and in the sky i saw
countless hordes of strange fiery crea-
tures apparently mounted on creatures of
burden the riders in the sky were oddly
like men in construction save that from

their sides grew three pairs of flailing
growths similar to arms yet not arms and
in these growths they carried curious tube-
like weapons and in size these beings
were monstrous

  my god i exclaimed when i could
find my voice what is it fo-lan
fo-lans eyes were gleaming in tri-
umph they are the star-warriors sent
by the ancient ones from orion up
there they listened to my plea for they
know that lloigor and zhar and their evil
spawn are deathless to man they know
that only the ancient weapons of the elder
gods can punish and destroy

  i looked once more into the sky the
glowing beings were now much closer
and i saw that the things they rode were
limbless-that they were exactly like long
tubes pointed at both ends travelling
evidently only in the power of the ray of
light emanating from the stars far above

  the ululations from beneath the earth
have guided them here-and now they
will destroy

fo-lans voice was drowned out abrupt-
ly by the terrific clamor that rose from
alaozar for the star-warriors had sur-
rounded the city and now from their tube-
jike appendages shot forth great beams of
annihilation and death and the age-old
masonry of alaozar was crumbling into
ruin then suddenly the star-warriors
descended entering into the city and pen-
etrating the vast caverns beneath

  and then two things happened the
entire sky began to glow with a weird
purple light and in the ray that descend-
ed from above i saw a file of beings even
stranger than the star-warriors they
were great writhing pillars of light mov-
ing like tremendous flames colored pur-
ple and white dazzling in their intensity
these gigantic beings from outer space
descended swiftly circling the plateau of
sung and from them great rays of stab-
the lair of the star-spawn



bing light shot out toward the hidden
fastnesses below and at the same time
the earth began to tremble

  shuddering i put out my hand to touch
fo-lans arm he was utterly unmoved
save in triumphant joy at the spectacle of
the destruction of alaozar the ancient
ones themselves have come he cried out

  i	remember wanting to say something
but i saw suddenly one of those incon-
ceivable pillars of light bending over fo-
lan and me and i felt slithering tentacles
gently reaching around me then i knew
no more

  there is little more to write i came to
my senses near bangka miles from the
plateau of sung and at my side was fo-
lan unhurt and smiling we had been
transported within the second by the
ancient god who had bent to save us
from the destruction of the things beneath
the earth



the statement of eric marsh ends thus
abruptly however what surmises
might be made from it this paper will not
state mr marsh had appended to his
curious statement several newspaper clip-
pings all of them dated within ten days
of his appearance at bangka where he
evidently stayed for a while with doctor
fo-lan before returning to america
there is room for only a brief summary
of the clippings

  the first was from a tokyo paper an-
nouncing the strange reappearance of
doctor fo-lan another clipping from
the same issue of that paper tells of a
curious electrical display witnessed from

several observatories in the orient seem-
ingly centered in its elemental force some-
where in burma still another paragraph
concerns an apparition thus it is called
supposedly seen in the night during which
doctor fo-lan and eric marsh so myste-
riously returned to bangka it was that of
a gigantic pillar of light towering far into
the sky and alive with movement it was
seen by forty-seven persons in and around
bangka

  the final clipping was dated ten days
later it was taken from an eminent lon-
don paper and is the verbatim report of
an aviator who flew over burma in the
endeavor to trace the source of a fetid
odor which was sweeping the country
nauseating india and china for hundreds
of miles around the heart of this report
is briefly

  the odor i traced to the so-called pla-
teau of sung to which i was attracted by
accidental sight of hitherto unknown
ruins in the heart of the plateau i found
to my amazement that for some reason
the earth of the plateau had been broken
and torn up for its entire area save for one
spot not far from a deep cavern near the
ruins which bears evidence of once hav-
ing been a lake on this spot i managed
to effect a landing i left the machine in
order to determine the meaning of the
great green-black masses of rotting flesh
which greeted my eyes at once but the
odor forced a quick retreat yet this i
know the remains on the plateau of sung
are those of what must have been gigantic
animals apparently boneless and utterly
unknown to man and they must have
met death in battle with mortal enemies

efaker of gargoyles

by clark ashton smith

the story of a mad horror loosed upon a mediaeval village by blaise reynard

the stone-cutter

among the many gargoyles that
 frowned or leered from the roof
of the new-built cathedral of
vyones two were pre-eminent above the
rest by virtue of their fine workmanship
and their supreme grotesquery these
two had been wrought by the stone-carver
blaise reynard a native of vyones who
had lately returned from a long sojourn
in the cities of provence and had secured
employment on the cathedral when the
three years task of its construction and
ornamentation was well-nigh completed
in view of the wonderful artistry shown
by reynard it was regretted by ambro-
sius the archbishop that it had not been
possible to commit the execution of all
the gargoyles to this delicate and accom-
plished workman but other people with
less liberal tastes than ambrosius were
heard to express a different opinion

  this opinion perhaps was tinged by
the personal dislike that had been gen-
erally felt toward reynard in vyones even
from his boyhood and which had been
revived with some virulence on his re-
turn whether rightly or unjustly his
very physiognomy had always marked him
out for public disfavor he was inordi-
nately dark with hair and beard of a
preternatural bluish-black and slanting
ill-matched eyes that gave him a sinister
and cunning air his taciturn and satur-
nine ways were such as a superstitious peo-
ple would identify with necromantic
knowledge or complicity and there were
those who covertly accused him of being
in league with satan though the accusa-


tions were little more than vague anony-
mous rumors even to the end through
lack of veritable evidence

  however the people who suspected
reynard of diabolic affiliations were wont
for awhile to instance the two gargoyles
as sufficient proof no man they con-
tended who was not inspired by the
arch-enemy could have carven anything
so sheerly evil and malignant could have
embodied so consummately in mere stone
the living lineaments of the most demoni-
acal of all the deadly sins

  the two gargoyles were perched on op-
posite corners of a high tower of the ca-
thedral one was a snarling murderous
cat-headed monster with retracted lips re-
vealing formidable fangs and eyes that
glared intolerable hatred from beneath
ferine brows this creature had the claws
and wings of a griffin and seemed as if
it were poised in readiness to swoop down
on the city of vyones like a harpy on its
prey its companion was a horned satyr
with the vans of some great bat such as
might roam the nether caverns with
sharp clenching talons and a look of
satanically brooding lust as if it were
gloating above the helpless object of its
unclean desire both figures were com-
plete even to the hindquarters and were
not mere conventional adjuncts of the
roof one would have expected them to
start at any moment from the stone in
which they were mortised

  ambrosius a lover of art had been
openly delighted with these creations
because of their high technical merit and
the maker of gargoyles

m

there came a thunderous crash and
the panes of the window were shat-
tered to fragments

their verisimilitude as works of sculp-
ture but others including many humbler
dignitaries of the church were more or
less scandalized and said that the work-
man had informed these figures with the
visible likeness of his own vices to the
glory of belial rather than of god and
had thus perpetrated a sort of blasphemy
of course they admitted a certain
amount of grotesquery was requisite in
gargoyles but in this case the allowable
bounds had been egregiously overpassed

  however with the completion of the
cathedral and in spite of all this adverse
criticism the high-poised gargoyles of
blaise reynard like all other details of
the building were soon taken for granted

through mere everyday familiarity and
eventually they were almost forgotten
the scandal of opposition died down
and the stone-carver himself though the
townsfolk continued to eye him askance
was able to secure other work through the
favor of discriminating patrons he re-
mained in vyones and paid his ad-
dresses albeit without visible success to
a taverners daughter one nicolette vil-
lom of whom it was said he had long
been enamored in his own surly and reti-
cent fashion

  but reynard himself had not forgotten
the gargoyles often in passing the
superb pile of the cathedral he would
gaze up at them with a secret satisfaction


weird tales

whose cause he could hardly have as-
signed or delimited they seemed to re-
tain for him a rare and mystical meaning
to signalize an obscure but pleasurable
triumph

  he would have said if asked for the
reason of his satisfaction that he was
proud of a skilful piece of handiwork he
would not have said and perhaps would
not even have known that in one of the
gargoyles he had imprisoned all his fes-
tering rancor all his answering spleen
and hatred toward the people of vyones
who had always hated him and had set
the image of this rancor to peer venom-
ously down for ever from a lofty place
and perhaps he would not even have
dreamt that in the second gargoyle he had
somehow expressed his own dour and
satyr-like passion for the girl nicolette-
a passion that had brought him back to
the detested city of his youth after years
of wandering a passion singularly tena-
cious of one object and differing in this
regard from the ordinary lusts of a na-
ture so brutal as reynards

  always to the stone-cutter even more
than to those who had criticized and ab-
horred his productions the gargoyles
were alive they possessed a vitality and a
sentiency of their own and most of all
did they seem to live when the summer
drew to an end and the autumn rains had
gathered upon vyones then when the
full cathedral gutters poured above the
streets one might have thought that the
actual spittle of a foul malevolence the
very slaver of an impure lust had some-
how been mingled with the water that ran
in rills from the mouths of the gargoyles



at that time in the year of our lord
 vyones was the principal town
of the province of averoigne on two
sides the great shadow-haunted forest a

place of equivocal legends of loups-garous
and phantoms approached to the very
walls and flung its umbrage upon them at
early forenoon and evening on the other
sides there lay cultivated fields and gen-
tle streams that meandered among wil-
lows or poplars and roads that ran
through an open plain to the high
chateaux of noble lords and to regions
beyond averoigne

  the town itself was prosperous and
had never shared in the ill-fame of the
bordering forest it had long been sancti-
fied by the presence of two nunneries
and a monastery and now with the com-
pletion of the long-planned cathedral it
was thought that vyones would have
henceforward the additional protection of
a more august holiness that demon and
jtryge and incubus would keep their dis-
tance from its heaven-favored purlieus
with a more meticulous caution than
before

  of course as in all mediaeval towns
there had been occasional instances of
alleged sorcery or demoniacal possession
and once or twice the perilous tempta-
tions of succubi had made their inroads
on the pious virtue of vyones but this
was nothing more than might be ex-
pected in a world where the devil and
his works were always more or less ram-
pant no one could possibly have antici-
pated the reign of infernal horrors that
was to make hideous the latter month of
autumn following the cathedrals erec-
tion

  to make the matter even more inex-
plicable and more blasphemously dread-
ful than it would otherwise have been
the first of these horrors occurred in the
neighborhood of the cathedral itself and
almost beneath its sheltering shadow

  two men a respectable clothier named
guillaume maspier and an equally repu-
the maker of gargoyles



table cooper one gerome mazzal were
returning to their lodgings in the late
hours of a november eve after imbibing
both the red and white wines of the coun-
tryside in more than one tavern accord-
ing to maspier who alone survived to
tell the tale they were passing along a
street that skirted the cathedral square
and could see the bulk of the great build-
ing against the stars when a flying mon-
ster black as the soot of abaddon had
descended upon them from the heavens
and assailed gerome mazzal beating him
down with its heavily flapping wings and
seizing him with its inch-long teeth and
talons

  maspier was unable to describe the
creature with minuteness for he had seen
it but dimly and partially in the unlit
street and moreover the fate of his com-
panion who had fallen to the cobble-
stones with the black devil snarling and
tearing at his throat had not induced
maspier to linger in that vicinity he
had betaken himself from the scene with
all the celerity of which he was capable
and had stopped only at the house of a
priest many streets away where he had
related his adventure between shudder-
ings and hiccuppings

  armed with holy water and aspergillus
and accompanied by many of the towns-
people carrying torches staves and hal-
berds the priest was led by maspier to
the place of the horror and there they
had found the body of mazzal with fear-
fully mangled face and throat and bosom
lined with bloody lacerations the de-
moniac assailant had flown and it was not
seen or encountered again that night but
those who had beheld its work returned
aghast to their homes feeling that a crea-
ture of nethermost hell had come to visit
the city and perchance to abide therein

consternation was rife on the mor-
row when the story became gen-
erally known and rites of exorcism
against the invading demon were per-
formed by the clergy in all public places
and before thresholds but the sprinkling
of holy water and the mumbling of stated
forms were futile for the evil spirit was
still abroad and its malignity was proved
once more on the night following the
ghastly death of gerome mazzal

  the time it claimed two victims
burghers of high probity and some conse-
quence on whom it descended in a nar-
row alley slaying one of them instantane-
ously and dragging down the other from
behind as he sought to flee the shrill
cries of the helpless men and the guttural
growling of the demon were heard by
people in the houses along the alley and
some who were hardy enough to peer
from their windows had seen the depar-
ture of the infamous assailant blotting
out the autumn stars with the sable and
misshapen foulness of its wings and
hovering in execrable menace above the
house-tops

  after this few people would venture
abroad at night unless in case of dire and
exigent need and those who did venture
went in armed companies and were all
furnished with flambeaux thinking thus
to frighten away the demon which they
adjudged a creature of darkness that
would abhor the light and shrink there-
from through the nature of its kind but
the boldness of this fiend was beyond
measure for it proceeded to attack more
than one company of worthy citizens dis-
regarding the flaring torches that were
thrust in its face or putting them out
with the stenchful wind of its wide vans

  evidently it was a spirit of homicidal
hate for all the people on whom it seized
were grievously mangled or torn to num-
berless shreds by its teeth and talons
those who saw it and survived were


weird tales

wont to describe it variously and with
much ambiguity but all agreed in attrib-
uting to it the head of a ferocious animal
and die wings of a monstrous bird some
the most learned in demonology were
fain to identify k with modo the spirit
of murder and others took it for one of
the great lieutenants of satan perhaps
amaimon or alastor gone mad with
exasperation at the impregnable suprem-
acy of christ in the holy city of vyones

  the terror that soon prevailed be-
neath the widening scope of these satan-
ical incursions and depredations was be-
yond all belief-a clotted seething devil-
ridden gloom of superstitious obsession
not to be hinted in modern language
even by daylight the gothic wings of
nightmare seemed to brood in undepart-
ing oppression above the city and fear
was everywhere like the foul contagion
of some epidemic plague the inhabi-
tants went their way in prayer and trem-
bling and the archbishop himself as well
as the subordinate clergy confessed an in-
ability to cope with the ever-growing hor-
ror an emissary was sent to rome to
procure water that had been specially
sanctified by the pope this alone it was
thought would be efficacious enough to
drive away the dreadful visitant

  in the meanwhile the horror waxed
and mounted to its culmination one eve
toward the middle of november the ab-
bot of the local monastery of cordeliers
who had gone forth to administer extreme
unction to a dying friend was seized by
the black devil just as he approached the
threshold of his destination and was slain
in the same atrocious manner as the other
victims

  to this doubly infamous deed a scarce-
believable blasphemy was soon added on
the very next night while the torn body
of the abbot lay on a rich catafalque in
the cathedral and masses were being said

and tapers burnt the demon invaded the
high nave through the open door ex-
tinguished all the candles with one flap
of its sooty wings and dragged down no
less than three of the officiating priests to
an unholy death in the darkness

  every one now felt that a truly formid-
able assault was being made by the powers
of evil on the christian probity of
vyones in the condition of abject terror
of extreme disorder and demoralization
that followed upon this new atrocity
there was a deplorable outbreak of human
crime of murder and rapine and thievery
together with covert manifestations of
satanism and celebrations of the black
mass attended by many neophytes

  then in the midst of all this pande-
moniacal fear and confusion it was ru-
mored that a second devil had been seen
in vyones that the murderous fiend was
accompanied by a spirit of equal de-
formity and darkness whose intentions
were those of lechery and which mo-
lested none but women this creature had
frightened several dames and demoiselles
and maid-servants into a veritable hysteria
by peering through their bedroom win-
dows and had sidled lasciviously with
uncouth mows and grimaces and gro-
tesque flappings of its bat-shaped wings
toward others who had occasion to fare
from house to house across the nocturnal
streets

	however strange to say there were no
authentic instances in which the chastity of
any woman had suffered actual harm from
this noisome incubus many were ap-
proached by it and were terrified immod-
erately by the hideousness and lustfulness
of its demeanor but no one was ever
touched even in that time of horror both
spiritual and corporeal there were those
who made a ribald jest of this singular
abstention on the part of the demon and
the maker of gargoyles



said that it was seeking throughout
vyones for some one whom it had not
yet found



the lodgings of blaise reynard were
separated only by the length of a
dark and crooked alley from the tavern
kept by jean villom the father of nico-
lette in this tavern reynard had been
wont to spend his evenings though his
suit was frowned upon by jean villom
and had received but scant encouragement
from the girl herself however because
of his well-filled purse and his almost il-
limitable capacity for wine reynard was
tolerated he came early each night with
the falling of darkness and would sit in
silence hour after hour staring with hot
and sullen eyes at nicolette and gulping
joylessly the potent vintages of ave-
roigne apart from their desire to retain
his custom the people of the tavern were
a little afraid of him on account of his
dubious and semi-sorcerous reputation
and also because of his surly temper they
did not wish to antagonize him more than
was necessary

  like everyone else in vyones reynard
had felt the suffocating burden of super-
stitious terror during those nights when
the fiendish marauder was hovering above
the town and might descend on the luck-
less wayfarer at any moment in any lo-
cality nothing less urgent and impera-
tive than the obsession of his half-bestial
longing for nicolette could have induced
him to traverse after dark the length of
that winding alley to the tavern door

  the autumn nights had been moonless
now on the evening that followed the
desecration of the cathedral itself by the
murderous devil a new-born crescent was
lowering its fragile sanguine-colored
horn beyond the house-tops as reynard
went forth from his lodgings at the ac-
customed hour he lost sight of its com-

forting beam in the high-walled and nar-
row alley and shivered with dread as he
hastened onward through shadows that
were dissipated only by the rare and timid
ray ftom some lofty window it seemed
to him at each turn and angle that the
gloom was curded by the unclean um-
brage of satanic wings and might reveal
in another instant the gleaming of abhor-
rent eyes ignited by the everlasting coals
of the pit when he came forth at the
alleys end he saw with a start of fresh
panic that the crescent moon was blotted
out by a cloud that had the semblance of
uncouthly arched and pointed vans

  he reached the tavern with a sense of
supreme relief for he had begun to feel
a distinct intuition that someone or some-
thing was following him unheard and in-
visible-a presence that seemed to load
the dusk with prodigious menace he en-
tered and closed the door behind him
very quickly as if he were shutting it in
the face of a dread pursuer

  there were few people in the tavern
that evening the girl nicolette was
serving wine to a mercers assistant one
raoul coupain a personable youth and a
newcomer in the neighborhood and she
was laughing with what reynard con-
sidered unseemly gayety at the broad jests
and amorous sallies of this raoul jfean
villom was discussing in a low voice the
latest enormities of the demons with two
cronies at a table in the farthest corner
and was drinking fully as much liquor as
his customers

  glowering with jealousy at the pres-
ence of raoul coupain whom he suspect-
ed of being a favored rival reynard
seated himself in silence and stared ma-
lignly at the flirtatious couple no one
seemed to have noticed his entrance for
villom went on talking to his cronies
without pause or interruption and nico-
lette and her companion were equally
oblivious to his jealous rage reynard


weird tales

soon added the resentment of one who
feels that he is being deliberately ignored
he began to pound on the table with his
heavy fists to attract attention

  villom who had been sitting all the
while with his back turned now called
out to nicolette without even troubling
to face around on his stool telling her to
serve reynard giving a backward smile
at coupain she came slowly and with
open reluctance to the stone-carvers table

  she was small and buxom with red-
dish-gold hair that curled luxuriantly
above the short delicious oval of her face
and she was gowned in a tight-fitting
dress of apple-green that revealed the
firm seductive outlines of her hips and
bosom her air was disdainful and a little
cold for she did not like reynard and
had taken small pains at any time to con-
ceal her aversion but to reynard she was
lovelier and more desirable than ever and
he felt a savage impulse to seize her in
his arms and carry her bodily away from
the tavern before the eyes of raoul cou-
pain and her father

  bring me a pitcher of la frenaie he
ordered gruffly in a voice that betrayed
his mingled resentment and desire

  tossing her head lightly and scorn-
fully with more glances at coupain the
girl obeyed she placed the fiery blood-
dark wine before reynard without speak-
ing and then went back to resume her
bantering with the mercers assistant

  reynard began to drink and the potent
vintage merely served to inflame his
smoldering enmity and passion his eyes
became venomous his curling lips malig-
nant as those of the gargoyles he had
carved on the new cathedral a baleful
primordial anger like the rage of some
morose and thwarted faun burned within
him with its slow red fire but he strove
to repress it and sat silent and motionless
except for the frequent filling and empty-
ing of his wine-cup

  raoul coupain had also consumed a
liberal quantity of wine as a result he
soon became bolder in his love-making
and strove to kiss the hand of nicolette
who had now seated herself on the bench
beside him the hand was playfully with-
held and then after its owner had cuffed
raoul very lightly and briskly was grant-
ed to the claimant in a fashion that struck
reynard as being no less than wanton

  snarling inarticulately with a mad im-
pulse to rush forward and slay the suc-
cessful rival with his bare hands he
started to his feet and stepped toward the
playful pair his movement was noted by
one of the men in the far corner who
spoke warningly to villom the tavern-
keeper arose lurching a little from his
potations and came warily across the
room with his eyes on reynard ready to
interfere in case of violence

reynard paused with momentary ir-
 resolution and then went on half
insane with a mounting hatred for them
all he longed to kill villom and cou-
pain to kill the hateful cronies who sat
staring from the corner and then above
their throttled corpses to ravage with
fierce kisses and vehement caresses the
shrinking lips and body of nicolette

  seeing the approach of the stone-
carver and knowing his evil temper and
dark jealousy coupain also rose to his
feet and plucked stealthily beneath his
cloak at the hilt of a little dagger which
he carried in the meanwhile jean vil-
lom had interposed his burly bulk be-
tween the rivals for the sake of the tav-
erns good repute he wished to prevent
the possible brawl

  back to your table stone-cutter he
roared belligerently at reynard

  being unarmed and seeing himself
outnumbered reynard paused again
though his anger still simmered within
him like the contents of a sorcerers caul-
the maker of gargoyles



dron with ruddy points of murderous
flame in his hollow slitted eyes he glared
at the three people before him and saw
beyond them with instinctive rather than
conscious awareness the leaded panes of
the tavern window in whose glass the
room was dimly reflected with its glowing
tapers its glimmering tableware the
heads of coupain and villom and the girl
nicolette and his own shadowy face
among them

  strangely and it would seem incon-
sequently he remembered at that moment
the dark ambiguous cloud he had seen
across the moon and the insistent feeling
of obscure pursuit while he had traversed
the alley

  then as he still gazed irresolutely at
the group before him and its vague re-
flection in the glass beyond there came a
thunderous crash and the panes of the
window with their pictured scene were
shattered inward in a score of fragments
ere the litter of falling glass had reached
the tavern floor a swart and monstrous
form flew into the room with a beating
of heavy vans that caused the tapers to
flare troublously and the shadows to
dance like a sabbat of misshapen devils
the thing hovered for a moment and
seemed to tower in a great darkness
higher than the ceiling above the heads of
reynard and the others as they turned to-
ward it they saw the malignant burning
of its eyes like coals in the depth of tar-
tarean pits and the curling of its hateful
lips on the bared teeth that were longer
and sharper than serpent-fangs

  behind it now another shadowy flying
monster came in through the broken win-
dow with a loud flapping of its ribbed
and pointed wings there was something
lascivious in the very motion of its flight
even as homicidal hatred and malignity
were manifest in the flight of the other
its satyr-like face was twisted in a hor-
rible never-changing leer and its lustful

eyes were fixed upon nicolette as it hung
in air beside the first intruder

  reynard as well as the other men was
petrified by a feeling of astonishment and
consternation so extreme as almost to pre-
clude terror voiceless and motionless
they beheld the demoniac intrusion and
the consternation of reynard in particu-
lar was mingled with an element of un-
speakable surprize together with a dread-
ful recognizance but the girl nicolette
with a mad scream of horror turned and
started to flee across the room

  as if her cry had been the one provoca-
tion needed the two demons swooped
upon their victims one with a ferocious
slash of its outstretched claws tore open
the throat of jean villom who fell with
a gurgling blood-choked groan and
then in the same fashion it assailed
raoul coupain the other in the mean-
while had pursued and overtaken the
fleeing girl and had seized her in its
bestial forearms with the ribbed wings
enfolding her like a hellish drapery

  the room was filled by a moaning
whirlwind by a chaos of wild cries and
tossing struggling shadows reynard
heard the guttural snarling of the mur-
derous monster muffled by the body of
coupain whom it was tearing with its
teeth and he heard the lubricous laughter
of the incubus above the shrieks of the
hysterically frightened girl then the gro-
tesquely flaring tapers went out in a gust
of swirling air and reynard received a
violent blow in the darkness-the blow
of some rushing object perhaps of a pass-
ing wing that was hard and heavy as
stone he fell and became insensible



dully and confusedly with much ef-
fort reynard struggled back to con-
sciousness for a brief interim he could
not remember where he was nor what had


weird tales

happened he was troubled by the pain-
ful throbbing of his head by the hum-
ming of agitated voices about him by the
glaring of many lights and the thronging
of many faces when he opened his eyes
and above all by the sense of nameless
but grievous calamity and uttermost hor-
ror that weighed him down from the first
dawning of sentiency

  memory returned to him laggard and
reluctant and with it a full awareness of
his surroundings and situation he was
lying on the tavern floor and his own
warm sticky blood was rilling across his
face from the wound on his aching head
the long room was half filled with people
of the neighborhood bearing torches and
knives and halberds who had entered and
were peering at the corpses of villom and
coupain which lay amid pools of wine-
diluted blood and the wreckage of the
shattered furniture and tableware

  nicolette with her green gown in
shreds and her body crushed by the em-
braces of the demon was moaning feebly
while women crowded about her with in-
effectual cries and questions which she
could not even hear or understand the
two cronies of villom horribly clawed
and mangled were dead beside their over-
turned table

  stupefied with horror and still dizy
from the blow that had laid him uncon-
scious reynard staggered to his feet and
found himself surrounded at once by in-
quiring faces and voices some of the peo-
ple were a little suspicious of him since
he was the sole survivor in the tavern and
bore an ill repute but his replies to their
questions soon convinced them that the
new crime was wholly the work of the
same demons that had plagued vyones in
so monstrous a fashion for weeks past

  reynard however was unable to tell
them all that he had seen or to confess
the ultimate sources of his fear and stupe-
faction the secret of that which he knew

was locked in the seething pit of his tor-
tured and devil-ridden soul

  somehow he left the ravaged inn he
pushed his way through the gathering
crowd with its terror-muted murmurs
and found himself alone on the midnight
streets heedless of his own possible
peril and scarcely knowing where he
went he wandered through vyones for
many hours and somewhile in his wan-
derings he came to his own workshop
with no assignable reason for the act he
entered and re-emerged with a heavy
hammer which he carried with him dur-
ing his subsequent peregrinations then
driven by his awful and unremissive tor-
ture he went on till the pale dawn had
touched the spires and the house-tops
with a ghostly glimmering

  by a half-conscious compulsion his
steps had led him to the square before the
cathedral ignoring the amazed verger
who had just opened the doors he en-
tered and sought a stairway that wound
tortuously upward to the tower on which
his own gargoyles were ensconced

  in the chill and livid light of sunless
morning he emerged on the roof and
leaning perilously from the verge he ex-
amined the carven figures he felt no sur-
prize only the hideous confirmation of a
fear too ghastly to be named when he saw
that the teeth and claws of the malign cat-
headed griffin were stained with darken-
ing blood and that shreds of apple-green
cloth were hanging from the talons of the
lustful bat-winged satyr

  it seemed to reynard in the dim ashen
light that a look of unspeakable triumph
of intolerable irony was imprinted on the
face of this latter creature he stared at
it with fearful and agonizing fascination
while impotent rage abhorrence and re-
pentance deeper than that of the damned
arose within him in a smothering flood
he was hardly aware that he had raised
the iron hammer and had struck wildly at
the maker of gargoyles



the satyrs horned profile till he heard the
sullen angry clang of impact and found
that he was tottering on the edge of the
roof to retain his balance

  the furious blow had merely chipped
the features of the gargoyle and had not
wiped away the malignant lust and exulta-
tion again reynard raised the heavy
hammer

  it fell on empty air for even as he
struck the stone-carver felt himself lifted
and drawn backward by something that
sank into his flesh like many separate
knives he staggered helplessly his feet
slipped and then he was lying on the
granite verge with his head and shoul-
ders over the dark deserted street

  half swooning and sick with pain he
saw above him the other gargoyle the
claws of whose right foreleg were firmly
embedded in his shoulder they tore
deeper as if with a dreadful clenching
the monster seemed to tower like some
fabulous beast above its prey and he felt
himself slipping dizzily across the cathe-
dral gutter with the gargoyle twisting
and turning as if to resume its normal
position over the gulf its slow inexor-
able movement seemed to be part of his
vertigo the very tower was tilting and
revolving beneath him in some unnatural
nightmare fashion

  dimly in a daze of fear and agony
reynard saw the remorseless tiger-face
bending toward him with its horrid teeth
laid bare in an eternal rictus of diabolic
hate somehow he had retained the ham-
mer with an instinctive impulse to de-
fend himself he struck at the gargoyle
whose cruel features seemed to approach
him like something seen in the ulti-

mate madness and distortion of delirium

  even as he struck the vertiginous turn-
ing movement continued and he felt the
talons dragging him outward on empty
air in his cramped recumbent position
the blow fell short of the hateful face and
came down with a dull clangor on the
foreleg whose curving talons were fixed
in his shoulder like meat-hooks the
clangor ended in a sharp cracking sound
and the leaning gargoyle vanished from
reynards vision as he fell he saw noth-
ing more except the dark mass of the ca-
thedral tower that seemed to soar away
from him and to rush upward unbeliev-
ably in the livid starless heavens to which
the belated sun had not yet risen

it was the archbishop ambrosius on
his way to early mass who found the
shattered body of reynard lying face
downward in the square ambrosius
crossed himself in startled horror at the
sight and then when he saw the object
that was still clinging to reynards shoul-
der he repeated the gesture with a more
than pious promptness

  he bent down to examine the thing
with the infallible memory of a true art-
lover he recognized it at once then
through the same clearness of recollection
he saw that the stone foreleg whose
claws were so deeply buried in reynards
flesh had somehow undergone a most un-
natural alteration the paw as he re-
membered it should have been slightly

ilidnight confession

    by j paul suter

from the death eetl in the big prison came a weird summons to right

                         a grave wrong

octor maddern threw back
the gray hair from his forehead
with a petulant flick of his long
hand he had been impatient with the
telephone receiver too snapping it back
upon the hook as if it had been to blame
now his ruddy face crinkled in a little
sardonic smile at the futility of both ges-
tures the telephone was not at fault
neither was his hair nevertheless even
a doctor inured as doctors are to unpleas-
ant scenes should not be expected to wel-
come an interview with a patient con-
demned to be hanged within two weeks

  of course he would go the warden
had said at once and had rather in-
sisted on a promise and delay would not
help matters every day maddern con-
jectured would make crawford a little
more desperate a little harder to talk to
the shadow of the gallows would sink
deeper into his soul what a fool the man
had been there really had been nothing
to hinder his illicit love affair mrs craw-
ford had been too ill to interfere and she
would have died in a year or so anyway
why should he have poisoned her

  maddern shrugged his stylishly coated
shoulders and rose to answer his wealthy
patients appeal he had not far to go it
was one of the curious features of the sen-
sational crawford case-a feature which
the newspapers had not overlooked-that
a circle with less than a quarter-mile
radius included the abodes of all the prin-
cipal participants including even the
chief witnesses appropriately in the cen-
ter of the circle stood mrs trelevants


prim old mansion some nimble reporter
had dubbed her the gossiping widow
in recognition of what her tongue had
done to bring her next-door neighbor to
the gallows but for her crawford might
still have been leading his free sophisti-
cated life she had started the stories
which had led the police first to incline
their ears incredulously then to exhume
the remains and hard upon that follow-
ing the discovery of arsenic in the stom-
ach had come the indictment and the trial
-with carrie trelevant as chief witness
for the state

  as he descended his own steps mad-
dern could look directly across the aristo-
cratic square at her house and crawfords
side by side and at crawfords garage
over which john chubbs his chauffeur
lived-another witness for the state nor
was that the limit of the curious craw-
ford case congestion tor warden ster-
ling of the penitentiary resided not two
blocks from the doctors he too was a
patient of madderns and little nonnie
jones had lived at the extreme southern
edge of the half-mile circle in the poor
smoky gulch district madderns rather
stern face softened a trifle as he thought
of her she was mrs crawford now
the poor devil had done the right thing
he had married her shortly after his
wifes death

  but one grim piece of stage property
remained to complete the grouping for
that sinister circle and it was there for
a brisk twenty minutes walk directly past
the crawford and the trelevant places

                    w t-
a midnight confession



w t-

brought maddem to the penitentiary
where crawford resided now where he
was to die

  warden sterling was ticketed in mad-
derns mind as an inn-keeper of coaching
days who had come a century too late to
his fat perfection in his office to the left
of the main corridor he wheezed and
blinked hospitality his sides quivered
his small bright eyes twinkled maddern
reflected unpleasantly as he shook the war-
dens welcoming hand that doubtless the
same cordial reception had greeted craw-
ford sterling prided himself on making
his charges feel at home could the man
be decently funereal the doctor wondered
when he hanged them

  you walked doc yes yes nothing
like it nothing like it i do as much as
you though you wouldnt think it not
so many steps but the exercise is there
three times as much weight lifted with
each step get it doe he prodded the
tall silent doctor in the ribs and brought
up a deep chuckle from the region of his
stomach then with no change in his

read this ihe said abruptly

jovial tone crawford wants to talk to
you awfully sad case it will seem like
hanging ones own brother he wants to
see you in his cell in his cell he says i
told him hed have to talk pretty low not
to be overheard but he kept on insisting
is it all right doc youll see him there
madderfi nodded and slipped in a
query as to how the wardens liver had
been behaving that delayed the inter-
view ten minutes more but with what
seemed undue speed nevertheless he
found himself sitting side by side on a
cot alone with the condemned man and
the cell door locked

the light was bad the fact that he
was actually within a cell in the
death row caused the doctor a little in-


weird tales

ward panic-after all no one knows what
the future will bring him-lem craw-
ford would not have guessed anything
like this a year before life in the cell
seemed stiff and unnatural like the open-
ing and closing of dead fingers under gal-
vanic force yet for all that maddern
found himself startled at how little his
old patient had changed crawford had
gone through this and his curly brown
hair was still carefully brushed his face
cleanly shaven there was still about his
rounded person the sleekness and poise of
the high-bred gentleman even his voice
carefully lowered to the requirements of
the cell had lost little of its careless lan-
guor many an evening in the well-
furnished crawford library the man now
condemned to die had talked with him
over the cigars in just that tone as if to
bring the past back even more strikingly
crawford began the conversation with
one of his infectious laughs

  perk up a little mad he entreated
youre not going to be hanged you
know

  i wish you were not the doctor re-
sponded stiffly

  crawford grinned maliciously at the
inane reply

  i was sure youd never have wished
anything like this on me but tell me
something old man he darted a keen
glance into madderns embarrassed face
on your honor now cross your heart
and all that do you think im a mur-
derer

  the doctor was terribly perturbed his
eyes dropped he was framing an evasive
reply when the prisoner laughed dryly

  thanks mad you have a beautifully
expressive face but dont you see how
my question clears the air we under-
stand each other now i cant say that i
blame you he looked off reminiscently
into the gray twilight of the cell under

the same circumstances id believe you
guilty certainly i should

  he grinned into the fascinated but
half-averted eyes of the doctor

  dont look so serious mad its not
going to be very awful a little darkness
before the eyes a little annoying tightness
around the neck a jerk and-bye-bye
thats all i am actually looking forward
to it it will be a new sensation-ive had
all the old ones all except suicide and
ive been tempted at times to try that i
nearly drowned once in my school days-
down for the third time-and im mak-
ing a bet with myself this wont be so
rotten as that wish you could hold the
stakes old man still there is something
you can do for me

  maddern was beginning to murmur
that he would be delighted when the
prisoners sardonic grin stopped him

  dont be too sure im going to ask
you to believe me innocent for the next
ten minutes can you do it

   ill try

   very good to make it easier for you
mad i am going to say to you as one
gentleman to another that i didnt kill
my wife this neednt affect your conclu-
sions from the evidence it is merely my
assurance to you as a gentleman if i
were really guilty i could not reasonably
ask you to believe me innocent even for
ten minutes you see that

  the physician nodded crawford
grinned again somewhat more maliciously
than before

  do you know im sorry for you
mad he went on you old hidebound
religious bachelor with your spiritistic
theories and all the rest of it youre due
to be horribly shocked in another minute
im going to confess to you that all they
said about little nonnie and me was true
-in a general way that is i think most
of carrie trelevants evidence was made
a midnight confession

up ftt of her head she had no chance to
see my goings on except when i visited
her but chubbs my chauffeur-he was
a damned poor sport to say what he did
after the way i treated him-he had it
right oh yes he had it right craw-
ford stroked his smooth cheek with his
plump well-manicured hand and made a
wtyface i married nonnie immediately
after mabel died that was the thing to do
but we kept the marriage a secret be-
cause- he laughed well youd

have kept it a secret wouldnt you

  i suppose so maddern admitted
shortly

	so much for that then does it startle
you to know that within two weeks after
mabel died-which by the way was a
week after i married nonnie--carrie
trelevant proposed marriage to me does
that startle you old man

  the doctor nodded-which indicator
of his feelings was made more convincing
by the fact that he actually had started at
the disclosure

  i thought it might crawford went
on with a flitting smile shes such a
proper old maid ill bet she talks spirit-
ism and higher life to you by the hour
when you call to treat her nerves but
she had taken it for granted-taken it for
granted mind you-that i had been in
love with her all along and had only been
waiting for mabel to die so id be free to
marry her now mad she has been your
patient for years can you surmise how
she acted when i declined her overtures-
which i was obliged to do rather violently
before she would believe me in earnest
doctor maddern gazed thoughtfully at
the bare floor of the cell then at the smil-
ingly expectant face of the condemned
man

  i should say that she must have been
furious he said at last

  crawford grinned

  i suppose furious will have to



serve he agreed it seems hardly
strong enough but i dont know a
stronger the thing happened in her
drawing-room i had gone over there to
pay her a neighborly visit-to chat a little
we had a good many interests in com-
mon and she isnt dull you know i
wont tell you what she did or exactly
what she said it hardly seems fair for me
to tell you that but when it was all over
-when she understood beyond doubt
that i valued her as a friend and nothing
more-she simply stood up white and
dumb and motioned me from the room
i think she could have killed me at that
moment im sure she could some weeks
later when the news of my marriage
leaked out it was just after that news
that she began talking about me

  when she began to tell about your
administering the medicine to mrs craw-
ford the doctor demanded

  crawford nodded

  she told it like an artist i couldnt
deny a word she did run over to tea with
mabel just as she said and i did mix
the medicine she left the inference that i
mixed some arsenic in with it and what
could i say to that but deny it of course
i had opportunity i use it in my garden
so does she-so do you the damning
thing against me at the trial was that i
seemed to have motive she had motive
too she might easily have dropped the
poison into mabels tea but who was to
believe she had proposed to me i had no
witnesses to that

  he stopped suddenly and shrugged
his shoulders with a laugh

  you attended mabel old man why
didnt you call it death by poisoning he
demanded

  because in her condition any irrita-
tion of the stomach could have caused
those symptoms and have hastened the
end maddern replied

  did the idea of arsenic occur to you


weird tales

    the doctor hesitated then he said
 later after your second marriage be-
 came public

    but you were too good a sport to ad-
 vertise it

    why should i it was only a suspi-
 cion she had eaten both strawberries and
 pickles at lunch against my orders that
 would have been quite sufficient

    crawford levelled a whimsical glance
 at his guest

    im afraid my ten minutes is up give
 me a renewal for another ten i want you
 to continue believing in me until im
 through what would you say old chap
 if i suggested a plan by which you might
 possibly get me clear of the noose

    the doctor looked up with utter in-
 credulity on his face

   i fear- he began

    of course you do you fear it cant
 be done and perhaps it cant but for-
  get that for a minute and answer a ques-
 tion for me you know carrie you know
 her kinks and her hobbies whats the
 chief one of them all

   you mean spiritism doctor mad-
 dern inquired slowly

    crawford nodded with a little chuckle
 of satisfaction

    i knew there couldnt be two answers
 to that question ive had some dealings
 with the lady too if ever any one be-
 lieved in ghosts she does very well-
 suppose a ghost appeared to her and
 commanded her to confess in writing-
 would she do it

   whose ghost the doctor demanded
   mine

 a good many years of active practise
 during which he had been father
 confessor to most human quirks and
 weaknesses had inoculated doctor mad-
 dern quite effectively against surprize yet
 he started slightly seeing which the ma-

 licious grin of the condemned man broad-
 ened

  answer the question just as it stands
mad ive a good reason for asking it

  well- the doctor passed a long

hand thoughtfully over his forehead
taking your question at its face value
then i should say this that if carrie
trelevant should be guilty such an ap-
parition as you mention very likely would
bring her to confess but if she should

not be guilty-

  crawford leaned forward with a sud-
den brightening of the eyes

  if she should not be guilty-yes
what then

  she wouldnt confess even for a
ghost she is too strong-minded shed
want to know why if the thing was super-
natural it should be accusing her falsely
thats fine old chap crawfords in-
fectious laugh rang through the cell
though he was careful not to raise his
voice when he spoke again if you think
the lady would not confess unless she
really is guilty you shouldnt object to
help me induce a confession could you
call here tomorrow

  probably the doctor answered dubi-
ously

  drop in at my house on the way over
get my keys from wilson-ive kept him
on theres one key in the bunch which
fits the trelevant grade door mabel
found it out months ago by chance-she
and carrie were always visiting back and
forth you know ill fix the details with
old sterling then you can talk with carrie
late tomorrow evening

  doctor maddern looked blank and the
condemned man went on with a trace of
his mischievous grin

  perhaps i had better explain before
you try to save me on a lunacy plea youll
call upon mrs carrie trelevant tomor-
row evening inform her that i am dead
a midnight confession



explain that i committed suicide in my
cell opening a vein will answer as well
as anything else add any frills you wish
but make the matter of my death perfectly
clear will you do that

  go on with the rest of your plan
maddern said

  the rest depends somewhat on old
sterling he has known me for years-
ever since i was a youngster he doesnt
believe me guilty this is confidential of
course but-he lowered his voice to a
barely audible whisper-he offered to let
me escape after the governor refused a
commutation-said hed take the conse-
quences himself of course i wouldnt
accept even if i could have made a get-
away it would have been a rotten thing
to do to poor old sterling but he knows
about this plan he is going to let me out
at midnight tomorrow night you can
wait at home for a telephone call from
carrie trelevant it will come-if the
trick has worked when you have her
written confession-if you have it-bring
it to old sterling he deserves the first
sight of it he is going to spend the night
in his office i will be back in my cell long
before that and he will bring the news up
tome

  maddern stared

  do you think this wild hair-brained
scheme is likely to succeed he de-
manded slowly

  its a forlorn hope i admit suppose
it doesnt work who will be most likely
to suffer-besides myself

  the doctor hesitated

  probably i shall be-though i can al-
ways take refuge under misinformation
are you willing to accept the chance
strangely enough upon that the most
momentous question of all doctor mad-
dern did not hesitate he rose and ex-
tended his hand

  it might work he conceded doubt-
fully at any rate i am willing to chance

it he smiled and shrugged his shoul-
ders when i came in here lem i
thought you guilty now im not so sure
if mrs trelevant did it-and if she be-
lieves you dead and out of the reach of
her vengeance-who knows-she might
confess

  he was met in the lower hall by the
jovial warden whose round face was al-
most serious

  are you going to do it doc he whis-
pered and when maddern nodded

  dont think im taking a chance ive
known him all his life and hes a gentle-
man hell come back ill spend the
night here myself so as to fix his getting
out and coming in not a single solitary
soul will be a bit the wiser doc its a
crazy thing to do but-he repeated the
doctors own words of a few minutes be-
fore-it might work

carrie trelevant rose with out-
stretched hand to greet the doctor
usually she amused him-all her move-
ments seemed so carefully calculated to
show her to the best advantage she had
her day and her night technique-the lat-
ter being in evidence just now did she
ever he wondered vary her initial posi-
tion in the big turkish chair by more than
the fraction of an inch when he called
upon her after nightfall that was where
she was to be found curled up in it like
a girl her face drooped pensively over a
book-but not drooped too far lest the
yellow light of the piano lamp should
emphasize her over-high forehead she al-
ways looked up with an unsophisticated
start which gave excuse for a moment of
surprized rounded eyes-she had pretty
black eyes next she ran half a dozen
steps toward the door then suddenly re-
membered to be dignified maddern saw
her go through it all as he had seen it
before the usual reflection crossed his
mind-that the kittenish tricks of the girl


weird tales

of twenty should have been lost some-
where on the road to thirty-five but to-
night she frightened him a little too was
she after all dangerous suppose she
should read his mind his conscience
troubled him slightly because of the trick
he was about to play upon her because
too of his visit to the penitentiary that
morning when he had left lem craw-
ford the bunch of keys he had been
treating her for five years-with the end-
less treatments demanded by a wealthy
woman whose illness is mainly of the
imagination he knew her well at least
he thought that he did but he had never
considered her dangerous

  oh you busy man she began in her
low contralto this was her bantering
technique-he knew that too you
have so many really important engage-
ments tomorrow you cant spare a mo-
ment for little me so you are here to-
night instead that was why you tel-
ephoned wasnt it-doctor maddern

  even the last two words were carefully
calculated-drawled teasingly as if she
had almost a mind to call him by his first
name hut dared not sometimes he en-
joyed her teasing tonight it seemed out
of place

   this isnt a professional call he said
gravely i have news

  news a rising nicety modulated
inflection the rounded eye technique

  news of lem crawford

  oh

  no technique at all about that mono-
syllable she had thrown into neutral she
was watching him narrowly as she sub-
sided again into her turkish chair and
he disposed himself in a pliant wicker
which was a favorite of his

  lem is not going to be hanged after
all

  that got her  she was sitting upright
in a second

  has his sentence been commuted
she blazed at him

  he smiled sadly slowly shook his
head

  you dont mean-a pardon

  neither a commutation nor a pardon
lem is no longer in the penitentiary he
has escaped

  he could see her relax and hear the
outrush of her breath

   theyll catch him she said lightly

  he paused a moment then let her have

it

  not where ke has gone lem com-
mitted suicide this evening in his cell i
thought you would like me to be the first
to tell you carrie-we have all been
friends together in days gone by   

  she took it nicely he found her even
willing to talk about crawford now that
he was dead-to comment on his pleasing
personality his wasted life and such
things she avoided certain phases of the
subject mabel little nonnie her own
testimony at the trial

  but when lie remarked airily you
and i are the ones who have always specu-
lated about the other world--but old
lem who never speculated in his life i
imagine is the first to know    she
shivered and darted a fleeting half-
ashamed glance toward the doorway
where silken hangings framed the black-
ness of the big hall he tried to command
his features while she rang for the maid
and directed the hall light to be lit
usually she preferred the room she was
in to be the little oasis of light in a dark-
ened house

  maddern was too good a psychologist
to spoil his work by lingering he left
promising to make his usual professional
call in the morning she followed him
girlishly to the big front door which was
her regular technique for taking leave of
him and he answered her wave as he ran
a midnight confession



down the stone steps but when the door
closed behind her and he was walking
across the soft grass of the square he said
to himself with a grim tightening of the
lips

   she did it

he was rather late in cleaning up the
work for the day it was after
eleven when he found himself a book
and settled down to be comfortable in his
library until carrie should telephone-if
she did telephone he thought she would
for he had paved the way rather nicely for
crawfords little theatricals she would
certainly need a doctor after they were
over he wondered how the warden
would pass lem through the gate without
arousing the suspicion of the guard
doubtless they would go out together and
lem would be disguised in some way
suppose crawford should meet one of the
trelevant servants the doctor specu-
lated on that possibility too but finally
dismissed it with a shrug old lem would
be equal to it as he had said himself
there werent many experiences he hadnt
gone through probably he would fright-
en the servant into hysterics suppose
too that carrie should not send for her
doctor but she would crawford had
it in mind no doubt to direct her to do
so in order that her confession should be
properly witnessed

  maddern yawned threw down his
book and listened to the deep voice of his
library clock chiming midnight it was
time for the apparition to leave the
penitentiary he wondered what sort of
ghost crawford would make possibly
carrie would favor him with a few de-
tails but he fancied not he could get
them later from lem

  he picked up the book again craw-
ford would require at least fifteen minutes
to make the trip and maybe another ten
for the performance at about half-past

twelve he could expect a telephone call

   but at five minutes after twelve the bell
rang he snatched up the receiver here
was a complication who else was calling
him but it was carrie trelevant

  she was incoherent correct enuncia-
tion studied modulation her fine con-
tralto nuances all were flung to the
winds yet she made herself clear she
wanted maddern

  this time he drove over so as to have
his car ready for ase if need be the house
blazed with light she met him at the
front door took his hand and dragged
him into her drawing-room she had
never done that before even in her most
girlish moments

  read this she said abruptly and
collapsed upon the davenport

  the paper she flung him was in her
writing but not in the even precise hand
she usually wrote this writing was
barely legible the letters tumbled over
one another with vertical strokes which
trembled in their short descent wobbling
infirm capitals ts without a cross yet
it was her hand it contained a confes-
sion in detail of mabel crawfords
murder

  she must have been watching him
from the heap into which she had crum-
pled on the davenport for as he finished
and looked up she came to him without
a word took the paper from his hand and
signed it

  sign as a witness she directed hand-
ing him the pen then as he did so now
take it  she hesitated for a moment
he looked into her eyes he never forgot
them afterward take it to the prose-
cuting attorney

  she was literally pushing him from the
room when she paused and spoke her
voice was calm but there was no timbre to
it it was the skeleton of a voice

  you have often speculated doctor


weird tales

maddern as to whether the dead return
she said they do

  that was all he was tempted at that
moment to tell her the truth but he
yielded instead to her wordless urge and
left the room looking back from the
brilliantly lighted hallway he saw her
there she stood holding to the library
table her hair was unkempt a streak
of gray he had never seen stuck out
prominently her cheeks were dead white
yet as she caught him ooking at her she
tried to smile it was the wreck of her
technique

throughout the short drive to the
wardens office he felt ignoble like
a man who has struck a woman reason
did not enter into the feeling he should
have been elated he told himself to have
helped save an innocent man and that
man his friend from the gallows but he
was not elated he remembered carrie
trelevants eyes

  once the paper had been delivered to
old sterling the matter would be out of
his hands sterling would turn it over to
the prosecuting attorney then would fol-
low the trial-that taste of hell again-
but this trial would be brief he won-
dered however whether there would be a
trial possibly he had already seen the last
of carrie trelevant

  old sterling was sprawled in the
swivel chair at his desk the pouches of
his rosy cheeks hung loosely he seemed
tired he glanced up as maddern stepped
into the office and pointed to an arm-
chair

  hadnt any trouble getting in i sup-
pose i left word at the gate thought
maybe you were on your way here when
i couldnt get you at the house so i
waited

  maddern unfolded the confession and
silently handed it to the warden

  the old man read it it fluttered from

his hand as he looked up his jaw
sagged and there was sweat on his fore-
head

  where did you get this he de-
manded

  you saw the signature the doctor
retorted dryly crawfords trick worked
-thats all i feel like a cad and i
rather think he will too my god ster-
ling he grinned ruefully she re-
minded me how we used to speculate as
to whether the dead return-and assured
me that they do

  the warden had risen shakily to his
feet he seemed bewildered

  she said they return he repeated
what did she mean by that

  why-doctor maddern felt a trifle
impatient with the old man-you know
the arrangement sterling i had the stage
all set she thought crawford dead
naturally then when he called on her
she took him for a ghost you cant blame
her when you consider that she believes

in ghosts anyway she-

  wait a moment the warden was
breathing heavily his face had lost its
usual color you say crawford called on
her

  the doctor glared

  you know he called sterling the
thing was all arranged among us are
you growing absent-minded

  but the old man ignored his tone and
continued doggedly what time did he
call

  well--she telephoned me at five min-
utes after twelve and everything was
over thats something i dont under-
stand either you were to let him out at
midnight he couldnt possibly have got
over there in five minutes you must have
slipped on the time

  the warden sat down heavily his big
cheeks sagged more than ever but his
eyes looked across brightly at the doctor
a midnight confession



 with a peculiar shade of horror in their
 depths

 you visited him again this morning
 doctor he said slowly did you by
 any chance leave a bunch of keys in his
 cell

 they were his keys one of them
 fitted carrie trelevants grade door that
 was why i came-to bring that key

 but you left the whole bunch

 doctor maddern nodded

 let me ask you something sterling
 seemed to be following a definite line of
 reasoning did crawford strike you as
 being convinced of carrie trelevants
 guilt

 well-yes

 was he sure he could make her con-
 fess

 the doctor hesitated a moment to pick
 his words

 perhaps not sure but confident

 the warden nodded suppose a sure
 means of escape had presented itself to
 him--a means which would be absolutely

certain yet which would not greatly com-
promise either you or me would he have
taken it

  i should have taken it in his place
maddern returned

  doctor maddern the old mans
voice had sunk to a whisper his bright
eyes were fastened on the doctors face
there was a little pen-knife on the ring
among the bunch of keys you left this
morning you remember it

  the doctor nodded with a start

  the understanding was that i should
release him at midnight i went up to his
cell it was just midnight-i didnt slip
on the time but he was gone

  you mean he had broken out the
doctor demanded almost shouting in his
astonishment but the warden shook his
head

  he had escaped by the one sure way
the little knife showed him how he
used it just back of the left ear doctor
when i went up at midnight he was
dead

suddenness of a specter taking shape from
nothingness

  eh do you say so petite the little
frenchman answered with a chuckle
bid him enter by all means

  the big red-headed plain-clothes man
advanced in noras wake a smile of real
affection for the frenchman on his face
behind him marched an equally big man
ruddy-faced white-haired with that look
of handsome distinction so many com-
monplace irishmen acquire at middle life

  shake hands wid me friend chief
otoole o th norfolk downs force
gentlemen costello bade with a nod
toward his companion timmie this is

in to give me a lift wid th damndest-
beg pardon-th most puzzlin case ive

  de grandin transferred his cigar to his
left hand and tweaked the needle points
of his tightly waxed blond mustache with
his right if the good sergeant costello
vouches for the case mon chef i make no
doubt that it will intrigue me he
answered tell us of it if you please
well sor chief otoole lowered
himself ponderously into a chair and re-
garded the gray uniform cap he had re-
moved with a stare which seemed to in-
dicate he sought inspiration from its silk-
lined depths well sor its this way
over to norfolk downs weve been hav-
in one hell o-one most distressful time
o it an none o us seems able to say
what its all about he paused twisting
the cap between his large white hands
and examining its peaked vizor as though
hed never seen the thing before

  um de grandin shot a quick glance
at the visitor this is of interest but
not instructive if you will amplify your

statement-

  beg pardon sor maybe i could help
costello interrupted timmie - chief

aim before he squeezed the trigger

weird tales

narrowly you mean that satan has a
hand in it or do you use an idiom

  no sor i mean exactly what i said
the chief replied  twas a matter o
three months or so ago-th night afther
christmas-when mike scarsci got hisn
everybody in th downs knew mike and
no one knew much good o him some
said he wuz a bootlegger and some a run-
ner fer a joint down windsor way-th
kind o place where ye git what ye pay fer
an no questions asked an if ye feel th
want o womanly sympathy theres a
young an pretty hostess to give ye what
ye crave however that might be sor we
used to see mike sliding round th place
whispering to th respectable folks who
might not be so good when they thought
no one wuz lookin an id a run him
out o town only i didnt dast offend his
customers so i wuz content to keep a
eye on him just until he pulled off sumpin
i could rightly pinch him fer

  well that night we heard him drive
up th edgemere road in that big ex-
pensive roadster o his an seen him turn
th corner like he wuz headed fer one o
th big houses on th hill i didnt see it
meself sor but one o me men name o
gibbons wuz near by when it happened
he seen th car go round th bend an dis-
appear behind some rhododendron
bushes an all of a sudden he heard some-
body give a yell as if th divils self wuz
on im an then two shots come close
together next moment wuz a flash o
fire so bright it blinded him an-that
wuz all

  but when he came a-runnin to th
place where scarscis car wuz stalled he
found mike wid his gun still in his hand
an th front mashed out o his head-
leastwise most of it wuz gone but
enough remained to show th footprint
of a monster goat stamped on im sor

furthermore there wuz th smell o brim-
stone in th air

de grandin raised the narrow black
brows which showed such marked
contrast to his wheat-blond hair eh
bien mon chef he murmured this
devil of yours would seem to be a most
discriminating demon at least in mon-
sieur scarscis case am i to understand
that you give credence to the story

  a tinge of red showed in otooles
broad face ye are sor he returned
i wuz brought up amongst goats sor id
know their tracks when i seen em even
if me eyes were tight shut an i recog-
nized th print on scarscis forehead
besides- he paused a moment swal-
lowing uneasily and a dogged stubborn
look came in his eyes besides i seen
th thing meself sor otoole breathed
quickly pantingly as one who shifts a
burden from his chest

  we all thought it mighty queer how
mike got kilt he went on but th
coroner said he must a run into a tree
or sumpin-though th saints knows
there wuz no tree there-so we had to
let it pass but widin another week sor
old man withers wuz found layin dead
furninst th gate o his house an he died
tli same way mike did-wid th top
mashed out o his head an th mark o th
beast on his brow there warnt no pos-
sibility o his runnin into no tree-not
even a tree as wuznt there sor-for there
he wuz spread-eagled on th sidewalk wid
his mouth wide open an his eyes a-starin
at th sky an there wuz blood an brains
oozin from a hole in his head big enough
to put yer fist into

  there wuz plenty said th old man
wuz a bad lot its certain he never let a
nickel get away once he got his hands on
it an many a one as borrowed money
from him lived to regret it but thats
the dark angel



not here nor there th fact is he wuz
dead an th jury had to bring it in as
homicide though o course they couldnt
blame no one specifically

  then last o all wuz mr roscoe a
harmless inoffensive sort o cuss he wuz
sor quiet-spoken an gentleman-like as
any that yed meet he had some money
an didnt need to work but he wuz a sort
o nut on atheism an ran some kind o
paper pokin fun at th churches fer his
own amusement

   twas about midnight ten days ago
when th thing got him id finished up
me work at th borough hall an wuz
headin fer home when i passed th bus
station mr roscoe gits offn th last bus
from bloomfield an we walks along
together as we wuz walkin past st
michaels church we seen th light which
burns before th altar an otoole
says mr roscoe  tis a shame that they
should waste th price o oil to keep that
thing a-goin when theres so much mis-
ery an sufferin in th world if i could
have me way says he id raise th divil
wid-

  an then it wuz upon us sor taller
than me by a good foot it wuz an all
covered wid scales like a serpent two
horns wuz growin from its head an its
eyes wuz flashin fire i couldnt rightly
say it had a tail fer there wuz small
chance to look at it but may i never stir
from this here chair if it didnt have a
pair o big black wings-an it flew right
at us

  mr roscoe give a funny sort o cry
an put his cane up to defend hisself i
wuz yankin at me gun but me fingers
wuz all stiff wid cold an th holster
wouldnt seem to come unsnapped

  th next i knew somethin give a
awful screamin laugh an then there
wuz a flash o fire right in me face an
im a-coughin an a-chokin wid th

fumes o sulfur in me nose an when i
gits so i can see again theres no one
there a-tall but mr roscoe an hes
stretched out beside me on th sidewalk
wid his skull mashed in an th divils
mark upon his brow dead he were sor
dead as yesterdays newspaper

  id made shift to snatch me gun out
whilst th fire wuz still blindin me an
had fired at where i thought th thing
must be but all i ever found to show

that id hit sumpin wuz this thing-

from his blouse pocket he withdrew an
envelope and from it took a small dark
object

  de grandin took it from him exam-
ined it a moment then passed it on to me
it was a portion of a quill clipped across
the shaft some three or four inches from
the tip the barbs a brilliant black which
shone with iridescent luster in the lamp-
light somewhat heavier than any feather
i had ever felt it was and harder too
for when i ran my thumb across its edge
it rasped my skin almost like the teeth of
a fine saw indeed the thing was more
like the scale from some gigantic reptile
cut in foliations to simulate a quill than
any feather i had ever seen

  i never saw a quill like this before

i	told otoole and

  heres hopin that ye never do again
sor he responded earnestly fer as
sure as yere a-settin on that chair that
theres a feather from a divils angels
wing

eggin yer pardon sor nora mc-
ginnis once more appeared abrupt-
ly at the door theres a young man wid
a special delivery letter fer doctor de
grandin will ye be afther lookin at it
now sor or will it wait

  bring it in at once if you will be so
good the frenchman answered all
special letters merit quick attention


weird tales

  bowing mute apology to us he slit
the envelope and glanced quickly through
the brief typewritten missive parbleu
tis very strange he exclaimed as he fin-
ished reading you come to me regard-
ing these so strange events tnon chef
and on your heels comes this attend me
if you please

my deaf doctor de grandin

   i have heard of your ability to arrive at explana-
tions of cases which apparently possess a super-
natural aspect and am writing you to ask if you
will take the borough of norfolk downs as diem
in a case which will undoubtedly command the
limit of your talents

   our police force admit their helplessness special
investigators hired from the best detective agencies
have failed to give us any satisfaction our peo-
ple are terrified and the entire community lives in
a feeling of constant insecurity

  in view of this i am authorized to offer you a
retainer of one thousand dollars immediately upon
your acceptance of the case and an additional fee
of fifty dollars a day plus reasonable expenses
provided you arrive at a solution of the mystery
which is not only causing our citizens much
anxiety but has already reached the newspapers in
a garbled form and is causing much unfavorable
publicity for norfolk downs as a residential center

  your promptness in replying will be appreci-
ated by

yours faithfully

               rolland wilcox

mayor of norfolk downs

  an will ye take th case sor
otoole asked eagerly

  sure doctor de grandin sor yell be
doin me a favor an timmie too if
yell say yes costello added

  assuredly de grandin answered
with a vigorous nod tomorrow after-
noon the good doctor trowbridge and i
shall wait upon monsieur le maire and
say to him voila monsieur here we
are where is the thousand dollars and
where the mystery that you would have
us solve but yes certainly 



the wealthy realtors and expensive
architects who mapped out norfolk
downs had done their work artistically
houses of approved english architecture

elizabethan tudor jacobean with here
and there an example of the georgian or
regency periods set well back in taste-
fully planted grounds along wide tree-
bordered roads which trailed gracefully
in curves and avoided every hint of the
perpendicularity of city streets com-
mercial buildings were restricted to such
few shops as were essential to the con-
venience of the community-a grocery
drug store delicatessen and motor service
station-and these were confined to a cir-
cumscribed zone and effectually disguised
as private dwellings their show windows
fashioned as oriels neatly sodded yards
set with flower beds and planted with
evergreens before them

  mayor wilcox occupied a villa in edge-
mere road a great rambling house of
the half-timbered english style with
romantic chimneys stuccoed walls and
many low broad windows a smug well-
kept formal garden fenced in by neatly
trimmed hedges of box and privet was in
front at the side was a pergola and rose
garden where marble statues fountains
and a lily-pond stood in incongruous con-
trast to the elizabethan house and vic-
torian front-garden

  i understand youve had some of the
details of the case already from otoole
doctor de grandin mayor wilcox said
when we had been escorted to his study
at the rear of the villas wide central hafl

  the frenchman inclined his head
quite so he answered i was most
solemnly assured you were suffering from
diabolic visitation monsieur le maire

  wilcox laughed shortly mirthlessly
im not so sure hes wrong he
answered

  eh you have some reason to be-
lieve- de grandin started then broke

off questioningly

  the mayor looked from one of us to
the other with a sort of shamefaced ex-
the dark angel



pression its really very odd he re-
turned at length folloilott rather in-
clines to the diabolical theory too but
hes so mediaeval-minded anyway

that-

  and this monsieur fol-this mon-
sieur with the funny name who is he if
you please

  our rector-the priest in charge of st
michael and all angels queer sort of
chap modern and all that you know but
believes in all sorts of supernatural non-
sense and-

  one little moment if you please de
grandin interrupted let us hear the
reasons for the good mans assumptions
if you will me i know the by-ways of
ghostland as i know my own pocket and
i solemnly assure you there is no such
thing as the supernatural there is un-
doubtedly the superphysical there is also
that class of natural phenomena which we
do not understand but the supernatural
non it is not so

  mayor wilcox who was bald to the
ears and affected a pointed beard and
curling mustache which gave him a
shakespearian appearance glanced sharp-
ly at the frenchman as though in doubt
of his sincerity then as he met the ear-
nest gaze of the small blue eyes re-
sponded with a shrug

  it was the michael which started him
our church you know is largely con-
structed from bits of ruined abbeys
brought from england the font is six-
teenth century the altar even earlier and
some of the carvings date back to pre-
tudor times the name-saint the arch-
angel michael is represented by a par-
ticularly fine bit of work showing the
champion of heaven overcoming the
fiend and binding him in chains it was
in first-rate shape despite its age when we
received it and every precaution was
taken when we set it over the church

porch but just before the first of these
mysterious killings took place the stone
fetter which bound the devil became
broken in some way folloilott was the
first to notice it and directed my attention
to the missing links he seemed in a
dreadful state of funk when he tokl us
the bits of missing stone were nowhere
to be found

   well well have a stone-cutter over
and have new ones carved i told him
but it seemed that wouldnt do at all
unless the identical links which were
missing could be found and reset right
away something terrible would descend
on the community he assured me id
have laughed at him but he was so
earnest about it any one could see he was
sincere

   i tell you wilcox he said those
links are symbolical the archfiend is
unchained upon the earth and dreadful
things will come to us unless we can con-
fine him in those sacred fetters right
away you have to know folloilott to
understand the impressive way he said
it why i almost believed it myself he
was so serious about it all

  well the upshot of it all was we
searched the churchyard and all the
ground around but couldnt find a sin-
gle trace of those stone links next night
the boot- the scarsci man was killed in
the way otoole told you and since that
time weve had two other inexplicable
murders

  no one can offer any explanation and
the detectives we hired were as much at
sea as any of us what do you think of
it sir

  um de grandin took his narrow
chin between a thoughtful thumb and
finger and pinched it till the dimple in its
tip deepened to a cleft i think we
should do well to see this statue of st
michael and also the so estimable clergy-


weird tales

man with the unpronounceable name
can this be done at once

  wilcox consulted his watch yes he
answered folloilott says evensong about
this time every day rain shine or measles
well be in time to see him if we step
over to the church right away

winter was dying hard the late
afternoon was bitter for so late in
march a leaden sky piled high with
asphalt-colored clouds held a menace of
snow and along the walks curled yellow
leaves from the wayside trees scuttered
and paused and scuttered on again as
though they fled in hobbled fear from the
wind that came hallooing from the north

  chimes were playing softly in the
square bell-tower of the church as we ap-
proached their vibrant notes scarce audi-
ble against the winds wild shouting

abide with me fast falls the eventide

the darkness deepens lord with me abide   

  a look of almost ineffable sadness
swept across de grandins features swift
as the passing of a thought have her
ever in thy gracious keeping lord he
murmured and signed the cross before
his face so quickly one might have
thohght him stroking his mustache

  theres folloilott now wilcox ex-
claimed i say mr folloilott here-

  a tall young man in shovel hat and
inverness coat strode quickly across the
patch of lawn separating the church from
the brick-and-sandstone rectory if he
heard the mayors greeting above the wind
he gave no sign as he thrust the nail-
studded door of the vestry aside and
entered the sacred edifice

  humph hes a sacerdotal fool our
companion exclaimed half angrily you
might as well try to get a number on a
broken telephone as attract his attention
when hes about his parish duties
ltm de grandin murmured the

one-tracked mind as you call him in
american hn and this st michael of
whom you spoke where is he if you
please

  there wilcox answered pointing
his blackthorn stick to a sculptured group
set in the wall above the pentice

  the group cut in high relief upon a
plinth of stone represented the arch-
angel accoutered in cuirass and greaves
erect above the fallen demon one foot
upon his adversarys throat his lance
poised for a thrust in his right hand the
left holding a chain which was made fast
to manacles latched around the fiends
wrists the whole thing rather crudely
carved had an appearance of immense
age and even from our point of view
some forty feet away we could see that
several links of the chain as well as the
bracelets binding the devils hands had
weathered and chipped away

  and monsieur vabbe insists this has
connection with these so strange deaths
the frenchman asked musingly

  he affects to believe so yes wilcox
answered impatience in his voice

  eh bien in former times men have
believed in stranger  ings de grandift
returned come let us go in i would
observe him more dosely if you please

  like too many churches st michael
and all angels did not boast impressive
congregations at ordinary services a
verger in a black-serge robe three or four
elderly and patently virgin ladies in ex-
pensive but frumpish costumes and a
young and slender girl almost nun-like in
her subdued gray coat and hat were the
sole attendants besides ourselves

  the organ prelude finished as we found
seats in a forward pew and the reverend
mr folloilott entered from the vestry
genuflected to the altar and began to in-
tone the service rather to my surprize
he those the long or nicene creed in

                    w t-
the dark angel



preference to the shorter one usually re-
cited at the evening service and at the
words and was incarnate by the holy
ghost his genuflection was so profound
that it was almost a prostration

  immediately following the collect for
peace he descended from the chancel to
the body of the church and began the
oflke of general supplication

  it was chilly to the point of frostiness
in the church but perspiration streaked
the clerics face as in a voice vibrant with
intense emotion he cantillated the en-
treaty

   o holy blessed and glorious trinity three per-
sons and one god have mercy upon us miserable
sinners   

  from our seats in the transept we were
almost abreast of the priest as he knelt
at the litany desk and i caught de gran-
din studying him covertly while the inter-
minable office was recited mr folloilotts
face was cameo-sharp in profile pale but
not with poor health lean rather than
thin with a high narrow brow deep-set
almost piercingly clear eyes of gray high-
bridged prominent nose and long point-
ed chin the mouth was large but thin-
lipped and the hair which grew well for-
ward at the temples intensely black a
rather strong intelligent face i thought
but one marked by asceticism the face of
one who might be either unflinching
martyr or relentless inquisitor as occasion
might direct

  no use trying to see him now wil-
cox told us when benediction was pro-
nounced and the congregation rose from
their knees after a respectful interval
hell be about his private devotions for
the next half-hour and-ah by george
i have it im having another friend for
dinnei tonight what dye say we have
folloilott and janet in as well youll
have all the chance you want to talk with
him

  excellent de grandin acquiesced
    w t-

and who is janet may one ask ma-
dame fol-the reverend gentlemans
wife

  lord no the mayor responded
folloilotts a dedicated celibate janets
his ward

  ah the frenchman answered with a
barely perceptible rising inflection i
drove my elbow in his ribs lest he say
more the frank expressions of de gran-
dins thoughts were not always acceptable
to american ears as i well knew from
certain contretemps in which he had in-
volved me in the pastl



eight of us gathered at the jacobean
oak table in mr wilcoxs dining-
room that evening the mayor and his
wife a slender dark young man of
scholarly appearance with refined semitic
features george wilcoxs son recently
admitted to the bar and his fathers part-
ner in practise the reverend basil follo-
ilott and his ward janet payne de gran-
din and i the meal was good though
simple clear soup fried sole a saddle of
canada hare salad and an ice white wine
with the fish claret with the roast

  de grandin studied each of the guests
with his quick stock-taking glance but
janet excited my curiosity most of all
she was slight and unmistakably attrac-
tive but despite her smooth and fresh-
colored complexion she somehow con-
veyed an impression of colorlessness her
long fair hair was simply arranged in a
figure  knot at the nape of her neck her
large blue heavy-lidded eyes seemed to
convey nothing but disinterested weari-
ness her lips were a thought too full
for beauty but she had a sweet rather
pathetic smile and she smiled often but
talked rarely hm i wondered pro-
fessionally is she anemic or recovering
from an illness


weird tales

  the sound of wilcoxs voice broke
through my revery i saw withers
executors today mr silverstein he told
the young jewish gentleman and i dont
think theres much doubt that theyll re-
new the loan

  to us he added in explanation mr
silverstein is rabbi of the congregation
beth israel withers held a mortgage on
their temple and was pressing them for
payment in full when he was-when he
died the executors seem more leniently
inclined

  a sharp kick on my shin made me
wince with pain but before i could cry
out de grandins hand was pressing mine
and his eyes beckoning my attention to
the clergyman across the table the rev-
erend gentlemans face had gone an
almost sickly gray and an expression of
something like consternation was on his
features

  i was about to ask if i could be of serv-
ice when our hostess rose and with her
janet went into the drawing-room evi-
dently the custom of leaving the gentle-
men at table with their cigars still ob-
tained in wilcoxs house for just an in-
stant as she passed the girls glance rested
on young wilcox and in it was tender-
ness and such yearning that i almost cried
aloud for it was like the look of a pau-
pers child before a toyshop window at
christmas time

  de grandin noted the look too tiens
monsieur iabbe he said genially as he
lighted his cigar unless i greatly miss
my guess you shall soon celebrate a most
joyous ceremony

  the clergyman looked puzzled how
do you mean he asked

  why when mademoiselle jeannette
marries with monsieur georges to be
sure you will most certainly perform the

  the other cut him off janet has no
place for earthly love in her life he
answered hers is one of those devoted
souls which long for sweet communion
with the heavenly bridegroom as soon
as she has come of age she will become
a postulate in the order of the resurrec-
tion all plans are made it is her lifes
vocation she has been trained to look
for nothing else since she was a little
girl

  de grandin shot a doubtful question-
ing glance at me and i nodded confirma-
tion st chrystosoms where i had
served as vestryman for nearly thirty years
was moderate being neither method-
istically low nor ritualistically high
but in a vague way i knew the ritualistic
branch of the episcopal church supported
monastic and conventual orders with dis-
cipline and rules as strict as any sponsored
by the greek and latin churches espe-
cially womens orders where the mem-
bers took their vows for life and lived as
closely cloistered as mediaeval nuns

  an awkward pause ensued de gran-
din tweaked the points of his mustache
and seemed meditating a reply and
knowing him as i did my teeth were on
edge with apprehension but wilcox
saved the situation i was telling doctor
de grandin your theory of the strange
deaths-how the breaking of the fetter in
st michaels hand might be responsible
he told the clergyman

  young rabbi silverstein looked puz-
zled surely youre not serious mr
folloilott he asked you cant mean
you believe theres some connection
between a graven image and these mur-
ders why its-

  folloilott rose his face drawn and
working with half-suppressed emotion
to one of your religion sir he an-
swered cuttingly the statue of the arch-
angel michael may be a graven image
the dark angel



to us it is a holy thing endued with
heavenly powers as for these murders
as you call them i am convinced no earth-
ly agency has anything to do with them
no human hand struck the blows which
rid the world of those moral lepers they
are unquestionably the visitations of an
outraged heaven upon contemners of
divine authority the call to repentance
has gone forth even as it did in the days
of the patriarch noah heaven is out-
raged at the iniquity of man and the
dark angel of death is abroad you may
almost hear the beating of his dreadful
sable wings there is no one as when
the first-born was slain of old to sprinkle
blood upon the lintels of o doors that
he may spare us and pass on repent-
ance is the only way to safety no mortal
man can stay his flight no mortal dare
impede him in his awful errand

  tiens there you do make the great
mistake monsieur de grandin answered
with one of his quick elfin grins i dare
do so the law forbids such killings and
be he angel or devil he who has com-
mitted them must answer to the law
furthermore which is of more immediate
importance he must answer to jules de
grandin certainly of course

   you the tall cleric looked down at
the little frenchman incredulously

   even as you say monsieur iabbe
for a moment they faced each other
across the table folloilotts piercing gaze
seeking to beat down de grandins level
stare and failing as the wind may fail to
move a firmly planted rock at length
you take grave risks lightly sir the
clergyman admonished

   it is a habit of long standing mon-
sieur de grandin answered in a toneless
level voice his little round blue eyes set
in a fixed unwinking stare against the
others burning gaze

the clergyman excused himself a short
while afterward and we were left
alone before the fire

  i think your rector needs a rest i
told the mayor his nerves are all un-
strung from overwork id say once or
twice i fancied he was on the verge of a
breakdown this evening

  he did look rather seedy wilcox
admitted guess well have to send him
off to switzerland again this summer
hes a great mountain-climber you know
quite a hunter too some years ago he
went exploring in the andes and brought
bade some rare specimens they say hes
one of the few men who ever succeeded
in bringing down a condor in full flight
de grandin glanced up sharply a
condor did you say monsieur-one of
those great andean vultures he de-
manded

  yes wilcox answered he risked
his life to do it but he shot one down
from an eminence of several thousand
feet got two of em in fact but one
was lost the others stuffed and mount-
ed in the museum at harrisonville

  a condor murmured jules de gran-
din musingly he shot a condor this

one and-

   furious knocking at the door followed
by the tread of heavy boots in the tiled
passage cut him short doctor de gran-
din sor chief otoole burst into the
dining-room amazement and something
strangely like terror in his florid face
theres another one been kilt we just
got th word

  mille tonnerres-another beneath
our very noses the frenchman leaped
from his seat as a bounced ball rises in
the air and fairly rushed toward the coat
doset where his outdoor wraps were
hung come friend trowbridge rush
hasten fly he bade me to otoole

along the frosty street not five minutes
ago i took a call at headquarters an is
this th chief o police a lady asks all
scared and trembly-like

    it is says i an what can i be doin

sor ill say that fer her th place is a
holy wreck an pore bostwicks a-settin
there in his livin-room wid th back
mashed out o his head an th mark o
th divil on his brow

   de grandin took a few steps in thought-
ful silence then and what was mon-
sieur bostwicks besetting sin mon chef
he asked

  eh

  what was it this one did which
might offend a straight-laced moralist
otoole returned a short hard laugh
howd ye guess it sor he asked

  name of an old and thoroughly de-
caying cheese-i ask you not you me
the frenchman almost shouted

  well sor norfolk downs aint like
some places we dont go pokin too much
into th private life o th citizens as pays

our salaries an-

   a has the explanations and apologies
what was it this one did i ask to know
well sor if ye must know they do

ladies time afther time i seen th pretty
ladies shteppin out o their cars before

lor sor an his bootleggers bill must a
been tremenjous judgin be th empty

bottles that wuz carted from his place
ive heard tell as how some o his little
playmates had husbands o their own
too but as twas all done quiet an order-
ly-like i never interfered an-

  no matter one understands de
grandin cut him short are we arrived



we were ablaze with lights the
big brick house in which theodore
bostwick had lived his gay and not par-
ticularly righteous life stood before us a
uniformed policeman at the door another
waiting in the hall crouched on a settle
by the fire shaking with sobs and plainly
in an agony of fear a very pretty little
lady in a very pretty pajama ensemble
raised a tear-stained face to us

  oh dont-please dont let them give
my name to the papers she besought as
de grandin paused before her

  softly mademoiselle he soothed
tactfully ignoring the platinum-and-di-
amond band encircling the third finger
of her left hand we do but seek the
facts where were you when it hap-
pened if you please

  i-id come downstairs to get some
ice the little woman answered dabbing
at her eyes with a wisp of rose-colored
cambric ted-mr bostwick wanted
some ice for the cocktails and i said id
come down and get it from the frigidaire

and- she paused and shivered as

though a chill had laid its icy finger on
her despite the superheated room

  yes mademoiselle and- de

grandin prompted softly

  i heard ted call out once-i couldnt
understand him and called back what
and then there was a dreadful clatter in
the big room upstairs as if everything
were being smashed and i was fright-
ened
the dark angel



  i waited for a moment then went
upstairs and-oh it was dreadful
precisement one understands as
much but what was it you saw

  youll see it for yourself when you
go up ted was sitting there-looking
straight at me-and everything around
him was all broken i took one look at
him and turned to run but on the steps
i must have fainted for i fell and when
i came to i was lying at the bottom of

the stairs and-

  what did you do next he asked as
she paused again

  i-i fainted

  morbleu again

  yes again something half stubborn
half hysterical was in her answer i was
going to the telephone to call the officers
when i chanced to glance up and

there- once more her voice trailed

off to nothingness and the color drained
from her pink cheeks leaving them ghast-
ly-white beneath the rouge

  the little frenchman looked at her
compassion in his gaze what was it
that you saw tna pauvre he asked
gently

  a-a face sir it looked at me
through the window for just an instant
but ill not forget it if i live to be a hun-
dred there was nothing above it noth-
ing below it-it seemed to hang there
like the head of a decapitated man sus-
pended in the air-and it glared at me
it was long-twice as big as any face ive
ever seen-and a sort of awful grayish
color-like the underside of a toad-
and great tusks protruded from its mouth
the eyes were green and glowing with
some dreadful light and there were
horns growing from the forehead i tell
you there were she paused a moment
while she fought for breath then very
softly it was the devil

  eh bieri mademoiselle this is of in-

terest certainly and then if you

please-

then i fainted again i dont know
how long i lay on the floor but as soon
as i came to i called police headquarters
de grandin turned to chief otoole
you came at once he asked

  yes sor

  who came with you

  kelley an shea sor

  tres bien you searched the place in-
side and out what of the doors and
windows

  locked sor locked tight as wax th
little lady here let us in afther askin
who we wu an we heard her throw
th lock an draw th inside bolt an chain-
fastener th back door wuz tight locked
an every windy in th place but one wuz
closed an latched th big windy in th
livin-room upstairs wuz shut but not
latched sor

  very good and that window there
-the one through which mademoiselle
declares she saw the face-what of it
its moren ten foot from th ground
sor an fixed-th frames set fast in th
jamb sos it cant be opened a-tall
very good let us ascend and see
what we shall see above

the upstairs living-room of bostwicks
house was a blaze of light for chief
otoole and his aides had turned on every
available bulb when they made their pre-
liminary search

  ah de grandin murmured softly as
we paused upon the threshold a-ah
facing us through the doorway which
gave upon the upper hall his chin sunk
on his breast hands clenched into rigid
fists upon the arms of his chair a man sat
staring endlessly at nothing with sight-
less film-glazed eyes he had been in
early middle life-forty-five perhaps
possibly fifty years old-with profuse


weird tales

gray-streaked hair and a vandyke beard
in which the brown was thickly flecked
with gray in life his face must have
been florid but now it shone under the
glowing electric bulbs with the ash-gray
pallor which belongs only to death his
parted lips almost as blanched as his
cheeks little gouts of perspiration glisten-
ing like beads of oil dewing his high
white forehead

  the room behind him was a welter of
confusion chairs were overturned even
broken the contents of the center table-
bits of expensive bric-a-brac and objects
of vertu-were strewn upon the rich tur-
key carpet the pieces of an almost price-
less kangshi vase lay scattered in one cor-
ner

  de grandin advanced and slowly sur-
veyed the corpse walking round it ob-
serving it from every side a little to the
left and above the right ear a deep
wedge-shaped depression showed in the
skull blood a little ruptured brain-sub-
stance and serous cerebrospinal fluid es-
caping from the wound the frenchman
looked at me with elevated brows and
nodded questioningly i nodded back
death must have been instantaneous

  dye see it sor otoole demanded
in an awed whisper pointing to the dead
mans forehead

  there was no denying it impressed
upon the flesh as though stamped there
with almost crushing force was the bifur-
cated imprint of a giant goats hoof

   they must a had th divil of a fight
otoole opined as he surveyed the devas-
tated room

  de grandin looked about him care-
fully it seems so he agreed but why
the evil one should vent his wrath upon
the poor mans chattels when he had
killed the owner gives one to wonder
nest-ce-pas

   an-an dye notice th shmell sor
otoole added diffidently

   de grandins narrow nostrils contract-
ed and expanded nervously as he sniffed
the air i too inhaled and down the
back of my neck and through my cheeks
ran tiny ripples of horror-chills there
was no mistaking it-trust one whod
served a term as city health officer to
know faint but clearly perceptible
there was the pungent acrid scent of
burning sulfur in the room

   de grandins small blue eyes were very
round and almost totally expressionless as
he looked from otoole to me and back
again at length oui-da he agreed
cest le soufre vraiment no matter we
have other things to do than inhale silly
scents

  but sor- otoole began

   but be grilled upon the grates of hell
mon vieux what make you of this he
pointed to a splash of blood roughly cir-
cular in shape and some four or five
inches in diameter which disfigured the
carpet almost underneath the window

  huh why thats where he bled
sor the irishman replied after a mo-
ments study of the ruddy spot

  exactement my friend-where he
bled now consider this- wheel-
ing he led us back to the seated body
and pointed in turn to the dead mans
collar and the back of the chair scarcely
a bloodstain showed on them

   i dont think i quite git ye sor the
chief admitted after a long scrutiny

  ah bah my friend are you then
blind the frenchman asked him almost
angrily consider one window was
open or unlatched at least and by that
window we find blood it is almost the
only blood we find but monsieur bost-
wick is seated in his chair almost as
though awaiting visitors is that the way
a man would be if he had died in fight
the dark angel



  well sor-otoole put up a hand
to scratch his head-he might a stag-
gered to that chair an died there afther

hed been struck-

  name of a blue rat my friend how
can you say so de grandin interrupted
the blow which killed this poor one
caused instant death doctor trowbridge
will bear me out in that no human man
could live three seconds following such a
blow besides if the man had staggered
across the room there would be blood
upon the floor if he leant forward as he
crawled toward the chair or blood upon
his collar if he stood upright yet we see
none save in this single spot that is the
spot where he bled my friend he was
undoubtlessly struck dead close by the
window then carried to that chair and
placed there with both feet flat upon the
floor and hands composed upon the
arms and then the one who killed him
smashed the furniture to bits the testi-
mony of the room can be interpreted no
other way

  the irishman glanced round the room
then at the dead man howly mither
he exclaimed at length im damned if
i dont think th dominie is right sor it
were th divil as done this thing no
mortal man could fly up to that windy an
kill th pore felly in thatway hepaused
to bless himself then lets be goin
sor theres no good cornin from our
stayin here

  de grandin nodded in agreement
then as we reached the lower hall we
shall not need the pretty ladys testimony
chief i believe her story absolutely-
she was too frightened to be lying-and
nothing she can tell us will throw light
upon the case meantime if you will
have a strict watch kept and see that no
one comes or goes except the under-
takers men when they come for the body
i shall be greatly in your debt

  to the trembling half-hysterical girl
he announced you are free to go at
will petite and were i you i should not
long remain here one never knows who
may come and having come depart and
retail gossip

  you mean i may go-now she
asked in incredulous delight

  perfectly my little cabbage to go and
sin-with more discretion in the future



pale daylight had scarcely dawned
when de grandin nudged and kicked
me into wakefulness have you forgot-
ten that we inspect monsieur bostwicks
house today he asked reproachfully
come my friend rush hasten make the
hurry we have much to do and i would
be about it while there are not too many
to observe our actions

  our hasty toilets made and a call put
through to ask otoole to meet us we
hurried to the house of death and while
we waited for the chief de grandin made
a careful circuit of the place this is
undoubtlessly the window where the lit-
tle lady with the fragile morals saw the
evil face look through he mused paus-
ing under the big chimney which reared
itself along the southern wall

  yes i agreed and its directly
underneath the window of the room
where bostwicks body was found too
the window chief otoole said was
closed but unlocked

  excellent he clapped his hands as
though applauding at a play i shall
make something of you yet friend trow-
bridge you have right now-ah que
diable

  he broke off sharply crouched sud-
denly upon the frozen lawn and crept
forvard quickly as though intent upon
taking something by surprize you see
he asked in a tense whisper


weird tales

  a tiny coppice of dwarf spruce was
planted in the angle of the chimney and
the house-wall and as he pointed i saw
diat one or two small branches were
freshly broken the tender wood showing
white and pallid through the ruptured
bark

  following him i saw him part the
lower boughs examine the frosty ground
with his nose almost thrust into it then
saw him straighten like a coiled spring
suddenly released from tension be-
hold he bade me seizing my wrist and
dragging me forward upon the hard
earth showed a tiny stain a dull brown-
colored stain no larger than a split bean
but unmistakable blood

  how- i began but

  and look at this-ten thousand small
blue devils-look at this my friend and
tell me what it is you see he ordered
sharply nearer the house where the
chimneys warmth had kept the frost from
hardening the earth to any great extent
there showed two prints-footprints-but
such footprints

  one was obviously human a long and
slimly aristocratic foot shod with a moc-
casin or some sort of soft shoe for there
was no well-defined impression of a built-
up heel but close beside it so placed it
must have been left by the same person
was the clear-cut unmistakable impres-
sion of a hoof-a cloven hoof-as though
an ox or giant goat had stamped there

  well i exclaimed then paused for
very want of words in which to frame my
reeling thoughts

  non he denied emphatically it is
most unwell friend trowbridge it is
diabolical no less tout la meme-he
raised his narrow shoulders in a shrug-
i shall not be dissuaded though satans
self has done these things ill not desist
until i have him clapped in jail my
friend consider has not the mayor of

norfolk downs retained me for that
purpose come let us go i see the good
otoole approaching and he will surely
be made ill if he should see this thing

  once more we searched the house as
carefully as a jeweler might search a gem
for hidden flaws but nowhere was there
any clue to help us at length we
must look at the roof de grandin said
it may be we shall find some little so
small thing to aid us there the good god
knows we have not found it here

   arra doctor de grandin sor taint
christmastime fer nigh another year
otoole objected

  eh what is it that you tell me-
noel the frenchman answered sharply

  why sor ye must be afther thinkin
it wuz santy claus as did in misther
bostwick instead o-instead o satan
he looked quickly round as though he
feared some hidden listener then signed
himself furtively with the cross

  de grandin grinned acknowledgment
of the sally but led the way uncompro-
misingly to the attic from which a trap-
door let upon the steep tiled roof paus-
ing for a moment to survey the serrated
rows of semi-cylindrical tiles with which
the housetop was covered he threw a leg
over the ridgepole and began slowly
working his way toward the chimney
early as it was several small boys loiter-
ing in the street the policeman on guard
outside the house and a dog of highly
doubtful ancestry were on hand to wit-
ness his aerial performance and as he
reached the chimney and clung to it both
arms encircling the tall terra-cotta pot
with which the flue was capped we caught
a flash of black and saw the reverend
basil folloilott pause in a rapid walk and
gaze up wonderingly

  de grandin hugged the chimney some
three minutes crooked his knee across
the angle of the roof and leant as fa 
the dark angel



downward as was possible examining
the glazed round tiles then slowly
hitched himself back to the trap-door
where otoole and i were waiting

  find anythin sor the chief inquired
good-humoredly

  enough to justify the risk of breaking
the most valuable neck which i possess
the frenchman answered with a smile
parbleu enough to give one food for
speculation too i am inclined to think
what wuz it

  the frenchman opened his hand and
in the palm of his gray glove we saw a
slim dark object resting a little wisp of
horsehair i supposed

  what- otoole began but

  no whats my friend no whys not
even any wherefores if you please the
other cut him short me i shall cogitate
upon this matter-this and some others
anon i may announce the goal to which
my thoughts have led meantime i am
too well aware that it is villainously cold
up here and i am most tremendously in
need of food

breakfast was laid in the pleasant
room adjoining wilcoxs kitchen
when we returned and de grandin did
full justice to the meal he was com-
mencing his fifth cup of well-creamed
coffee when a maid announced the rev-
erend basil folloilott

  despite the coldness of the day the
clergymans pale face was even paler
than its usual wont as he came into the
breakfast room still a little short of
breatii from rapid walking dreadful
news of mr bostwick he announced as
he greeted us reservedly the poor un-
fortunate cut off in deadly sin-if only

he had seen the light in time-

  who says he was cut off in sin mon-
sieur de grandin broke in suddenly

  i do the clergymans pale lips

snapped shut upon the words i know
he was time after time night after
night i saw his paramours arriving at his
door as i watched from my study win-
dow and i went to him with messages of
peace-redemption and release through
hearty and unfeigned repentance but
he-

  eh bien monsieur one can guess
without great difficulty what he said to
you the frenchman answered with a
laugh

  one can the cleric answered hotly
he told me to go to the devil-me the
messenger of holiness there was no
hope for such as he he led a life of sin
in sin he died and god can find no pity
for a wretch like him the lord him-
self-

  it seems i have read somewhere of a
lady whose behavior was not all a ladys
conduct ought to be yet who was counted
of some worth in later days de grandin
interrupted softly

  an ugly sneer gathered at the corners
of folloilotts mouth indeed he asked
sarcastically she was a countrywoman
of yours no doubt monsieur de gran-
din

  no-o the frenchman answered slow-
ly while a malicious twinkle flickered in
his eyes she was from magdala-the
scriptures call her mary magdalene and
somewhere i have heard the blessed
master did not bar her out of paradise
although her life had been at least as bad
as that of monsieur bostwick

t say de grandin you seem to take
delight in getting a rise out of fol-
loilott wilcox accused when the clergy-
man had taken a hasty and offended leave

  the almost boorish manner of the
preacher puzzled me perhaps the mans
a pious hypocrite i hazarded but

  mais non denied the frenchman


weird tales

pious he is i freely grant-but a hypo-
crite no it is not so he is in deadly
earnest that one how much his deadli-
ness exceeds his earnestness i should not

care to guess but- he lapsed into

a moody silence

  what dye mean i urged are

you implying that-

  ah bah i did but let my wits go
wool-gathering-there is a black dog run-
ning through my brain friend trow-
bridge he apologized forget what i
have said i was conversing through the
hat as you so drolly say



de grandin was busy all that day
making a hasty trip to the city re-
turning for luncheon then dashing off to
consult chief otoole till nearly dinner
time

  he kept the table in an uproar with his
witty sallies throughout the meal and
when dessert was served young george
wilcox pulled a long face id rather
sit right here and talk with you than go
out tonight doctor de grandin he de-
clared but-

 ah-ha ah-ha-ha-i see him
laughed de grandin i too was young
upon a time my friend i know the
ecstasy of the little hands soft pressure
the holy magic which can be found with-
in the loved ones glance go to her with
speed mon vieux you were not half a
man if you delayed your tryst to talk with
such a silly one as jules de grandin hold
her hand gently mon brave it is a fragile
thing i make no doubt

  the boy retreated with a sheepish grin
and heightened color

  i wish george wouldnt see her
mrs wilcox sighed plaintively theyre
terribly in love of course but mr fol-
loilott wont hear of it-hes mapped the
poor girls life for her you know and

next may she starts on her novitiate at
carlinville i suppose he knows best hes

such a thoroughly good man but-

she broke off with another sigh as
though she felt herself a heretic for ques-
tioning the rectors wisdom

  we played bridge after dinner but de
grandins mind was not upon the game
he lost consistently and shortly after ten
oclock excused himself on the plea he
had a busy day before him paid his losses
and furtively beckoned me to join him in
our room

  friend trowbridge he informed
me earnestly we must do something for
those children it is an outrage two young
hearts should thus be pried apart you
saw the look she gave him yesternight at
table-a look in which her very heart
beat for release against the fetters of her
eyes you saw the look on young mon-
sieurs face this evening our business is
to help them to each other

  our business is to find out whos per-
petrating these murders-if its not the
devil himself as otoole and folloilott
seem to think i broke in roughly this
boy-and-girl affairs just puppy love they
may think their hearts are broken
but-

  zut who says it he cried sharply
i tell you good friend trowbridge a
mans heart breaks but once and then it
is forever mi sere dedieu do i not know
it as for these killings my friend i am
the wiser though not sadder man to-
night attend me at harrisonville i
had the tiny flecks of hard-dried liquid
which we found outside monsieur bost-
wicks window analyzed they were as
i suspected blood-human blood also
while he was absent on some parish duty
i did feloniously and most unlawfully in-
sert myself into the reverend gentlemans
study and made a careful search behold
what i have found- from the pocket
the dark angel



of his dinner coat he took several small
twisted things grayish curved objects
which looked for all the world like sec-
tions of a hard gray doughnut

  what the deuce- i began but

he stopped me with a grin

  chains my friend-chains of the
devil no less the mystery of the holy
michaels tether for the devil is ex-
plained i would not go so far as to de-
clare that the good cleric broke that
carven chain then spread the story of im-
pending doom about but unquestionably
he had possession of the missing links
even while he helped search for them in
places where he knew that they were not
what do you make of that

  why- i looked at him in open-

mouthed amazement why-

  exactly precisely quite so it is our
task to find out why and unless i am
more mistaken than i think i am we
shall know something ere we see another
morning

  yawning he stripped off his jacket and
waistcoat pulled his pajama coat on
above his shirt and proceeded to snap on
every available bulb in the room once
more he yawned prodigiously went to
the window and unbarred it flinging
wide the casement and spreading wide
his arms in a tremendous stretch i
yawned in sympathy as he stood there
with jaws agape the personification of a
man who can withstand the urge to sleep
no longer

  a moment he stood thus then snap-
ping off the light leaped quickly in the
bed and pulied the comforter about his
neck

  good lord youre not going to sleep
that way are you i asked amazed

  pardieu i shall not sleep at all my
friend he answered in a whisper and
you will please have the goodness not to
shout climb into bed if you desire and

pull the blankets over you but do not
sleep we shall have need of wakefulness
before the night is done i damn think

  despite his admonition i dropped off
the respite from the cares of my practise
and the dull evening at cards combined
to wear down my will to stay awake how
long i slept i do not know but something
-that odd sixth sense which rouses sleep-
ing cats dogs and physicians-brought
me full-conscious from the fairyland of
dreams no time was needed to orient
myself my eyes turned unbidden to the
window which de grandin had left open

  the steady southwest wind had chased
the clouds before it and the moonlight
fell as bright almost as midday on the
planted lawn outside bars of the silvery
luminance struck through the open case-
ment and lay along the floor as bright
and unobscured as-stay there was a
shadow blotting out the moonlight some-
thing was moving very slowly sound-
lessly outside the window

  i strained my eyes to pierce the inter-
vening gloom then sat bolt-upright hor-
ror gripping at my throat chill grisly
fear dragging at my scalp

  across the eighteen-inch-wide sill it
came as quiet as a creeping snake a
great black thing the moonlight glinting
evilly on the polished scales which over-
laid its form from its shoulders right
and left spread great black wings
gleaming with a sort of horrid half-
dulled luster and as they grasped the
window-sill i caught a glimpse of long
carved talons pitiless as those of any vul-
ture but larger and more cruel by far
than those of any bird

  but awful as the dread form was the
countenance was more so a ghastly sort
of white it was not white as snow or
polished bone is white not white as
deaths pale visage may be white but a
leprous unclean white the sort of pallor


weird tales

which can not be dissociated from dis-
ease corruption and decay through the
pale mask of horror looked two brilliant
glaring eyes like corpse-lights shining
through the sockets of a fleshless skull
and from the forehead reared a pair of
curving pointed horns a dreadful mem-
ory rushed across the years a memory of
childish fear which had laid dormant but
undead for nearly half a century with
my own eyes i saw in living form the
figure of apollyon out of pilgrims pro-
gress

  i tried to cry aloud to warn de gran-
din of the visitants approach but only a
dull croaking sound scarce louder than
a sigh escaped my palsied lips

  low as the utterance was it seemed to
carry to the creeping horror with a wild
demoniac laugh it launched itself upon
the bed where my little friend lay sleep-
ing and in an instant i heard the sicken-
ing impact of a blow-another blow-
and then a high cracked voice crying
accursed of god go now and tell your
master who keeps watch and ward upon
the earth

  weapon i had none but at the bedside
stood a table with a chromium carafe of
chilled spring water and this i hurled
with all my might straight at the awful
face

  a second marrow-freezing cry went up
and then a flash of blinding light-bright
as a summer storms forked lightning on
a dark night-flared in my eyes and i
choked and gasped as strangling fumes
of burning sulfur filled my mouth and
nostrils

 de grandin oh de grandin i
wailed leaping from the bed and blun-
dering against furniture as i sought the
light too well i knew that jules de
grandin could not hear my voice already
i had seen the effects of such flailing
blows as i had heard the little french-

man lay upon his bed his head crushed
in his gallant spirit gone for ever from
his slender gallant body

  tiens my friend you battled him
right manfully i dare assert his belly is
most villainously sore where you hit it
with the bottle de grandins voice came
to me from the farther end of the room
and as my light-burned eyes regained
their sight i saw him crawl forth from
behind an overstuffed armchair

  my first impulse was to rush upon him
and clasp him in my arms then sudden
hot resentment rose within me you
were there all the time i accused sup-
pose it had struck me instead of-

  of the pillow which i so artistically
arranged within the bed to simulate my-
self he interrupted with an impish
grin in such a case i should have
brought this into play he waved the
heavy french army revolver which he
held in his right hand i could have
dropped him at any time but i desired to
see what he was about it was a gallant
show nest-ce-pas

  but-but was it really human i de-
manded shuddering at the dreadful
memory of the thing dye suppose a
bullet could have reached it i could
have sworn-

  assuredly you could he acquiesced
and chuckled so can the good otoole
and so can our most reverend friend the

abbe with the funny name but-

  a thunderous knocking at the door
broke through his words doctor de
grandin is everything all right mayor
wilcox called anxiously i thought i
heard a noise in your room and-noth-
ings happened has it

  not yet the frenchman answered
coolly nothing of any consequence
monsieur le moire but something of im-
portance happens shortly or jules de
the dark angel



grandin will eat turnips for next christ-
mas dinner

  thats good mayor wilcox an-
swered at first i thought it might be
george stumbling over something as he

came in but-

  ha petit monsieur georges-he is
still out the frenchman interrupted
shrilly

 yes but-

  grand dieu des pores grand dieu
des coqs grand dieu des artichauts-
come friend trowbridge for your life
for his life for their lives we must
hasten rush fly to warn them of the hor-
ror which stalks by night oh make
haste my friend make haste i beg of
you

  wondering i got into my hat and
overcoat while de grandin thrust the
heavy pistol in his outer pocket and beat
his hands together as he urged me fever-
ishly to hurry

  tell me monsieur he asked the
mayor where does monsieur georges
make the assignation with his sweetheart
not at the rectory i hope

  thats the worst of it wilcox an-
swered folloilotts forbidden him the
house so janet slips out and meets him
somewhere and they drive around i
shouldnt be surprized if they were
parked along the roadside somewhere
but only heaven knows where with all
this reckless driving and bootlegging and
hijacking going on im in a perfect jit-
ter every night till he gets home

and-

  name of a mannerless small blue pig
our task is ten times harder the french-
man interrupted come friend trow-
bridge we must search the secret paths
seek out the cars secluded by the roadside
and warn them of their peril pardieu i
should have warned him of it ere he left
the house



there was something vaguely sinister
in the night as we set out a chill not
wholly due to the shrewd wind which
blew in from the meadows was biting at
my nerves as we walked quickly down the
winding darkened road some half a
dozen blocks beyond the house we came
on a parked car but when de grandin
flashed his searchlight toward it the angry
question of a strange young man in-
formed us we had failed to find the pair
we sought nevertheless

  the thing responsible for the deaths
which have terrorized the town is out to-
night my friends the little frenchman
warned we ourselves have seen it but

a moment since and-

  then you stay here and see it by your
self old chap the young man bade as
he disengaged himself from the clinging
arms of his companion shot his self-
starter and set his car in motion

  three other amorous couples took to
flight as we gave warning and de gran-
din was close upon hysteria when the
darting shaft of luminance from his flash-
light at last picked out the dark-blue body
of young wilcoxs modish roadster as
we crept softly forward we heard a
womans voice rich deep contralto
husky with emotion

  my darling more to me than this
world and the next it must-it has to be
-good-bye there is no way i can avoid
it no other way my dear its fate-the
will of god-whatever we may choose to
call it dear but it has to be if it were
any one else it might be different but
you know him you know how much he
hates the world and how much such
things mean to him and if it were only
that he wanted me to do it i might defy
him-though i never did before love
might make me brave enough to do it-
but its more than that im vowed and


weird tales

dedicated dear long long ago i took an
oath upon my naked knees to do this
thing and i can not-i dare not break it
oh my dearest one why-why-did i
have to meet you before they had me
safely in the sisterhood i might have
been happy for you cant miss the sun-
shine if youve always been blind but

now- she paused and in a faint

glow of the dashboard light we saw her
take his face between her hands draw his
head to her and kiss him on the lips

 monsieur-mademoiselle- the

frenchman started but never finished
speaking

  out of the blackness of surrounding
night its body but a bare shade lighter
than the gloom dreadful fleshless head
and horrid eyes agleam emerged the
phantom-thing wed seen a half-hour
earlier in our bedroom the night wind
whistled with a kind of hellish glee be-
tween the sable pinions of the things ex-
tended wings and the gleam of phos-
phorescence in its hollow orbless eye-
holes was like the staring of a basilisk i
stood immobile rooted in my tracks and
watched destruction bearing down upon
the hapless lovers

  not so de grandin sa-ha monsieur
iassistant du diable it seems we meet
again-unhappily for you he an-
nounced in a deadly quiet voice and as
he spoke the detonation of his pistol split
the quiet night as summer thunder rends
a lowering rain-doud crash-crash the
pistol roared again the phantom-thing
paused irresolute as though a wall of
hidden steel had suddenly been reared in
its path and as it halted momentarily the
frenchman fired again coolly deliber-
ately taking careful aim before he
squeezed the trigger of his heavy weapon

  a sort of crackling like the scuttering
of dry dead leaves along the autumn
roads sounded as the fearsome thing bent

slowly back tottered uncertainly a mo-
ment then fell to earth with a sharp
metallic rattle and lay there motionless
its wide black wings outspread its scale-
clad arms outflung its legs grotesquely
twisted under it

  tiens i did not shoot too soon it
seems de grandin told young wilcox
cheerfully as he neared the roadster and
smiled upon the startled lovers had i
delayed a second longer i damn think that
the papers would have told the story of
another murder in the morning

  i walked up to the supine monster a
sort of grisly terror tugging at my nerves
even though my reason reassured me it
was dead

   the eyeholes in the skull-like face still
glared malevolently but a closer look
convinced me that nothing more uncanny
than luminous paint was responsible for
their sullen gleam	

  half timidly half curiously i bent
and touched the thing the face was but
a mask of some plaster-like substance and
this was cracked and broken just above
the eyes and through the fissure where
de grandins ball had gone there came a
little stream of blood dyeing the gray-
white surface of the plaster mask a sick-
ening rusty-red about the body and the
limbs was drawn a tightly-fitting suit of
tough black knitted fabric similar to the
costume of an acrobat and to the cloth
was sewn row after row of overlapping
metal scales one foot was clothed in
what looked like a heavy stocking of the
same material as the suit while to the
other was affixed two plinths of solid rub-
ber-evidently the halves of a split rub-
ber heel here was the explanation of the
cloven footprint we had seen impressed
upon the earth by bostwicks house

  still grasped within the things right
hand there lay the handle of the oddest-
looking hammer i had ever seen-heavy
the dark angel



as a blacksmiths sledge but fashioned
like an anvil one end a sharp and pointed
cone the other flat but fitted with a sort
of die shaped like the hoof of a gigantic
goat thats it i murmured as if i
would convince myself thats what was
used to stamp the devils mark upon the
victims faces first smash the skull with
the pointed end and then reverse the
weapon and stamp the victim with the
devils brand

  again i bent to touch the ghastly head
and at my touch the mask rolled sidewise
then shattered as it had been by de gran-
dins bullet split in two parts laying bare
the face beneath

  de-de grandin i croaked hoarse-
ly it-its-

  of course it is he supplied as my
lips refused to frame the name i have
known for some time it was the reverend
gentleman-who else could it have
been

  he turned his shoulder toward me and
called across it leave him as he lies
my friend he will make interesting ma-
terial for the coroner

  but-but dont you even want to
look i expostulated horrified by his
indifference

  for why he answered i saw him
when he tried to batter out my brains
that look was quite enough my friend
let the others gaze on him and marvel
let us return to monsieur wilcoxs house
with these ones there is something i
would say to them anon



de grandin called otoole and told
him briefly what had happened
then having notified him where the body
lay hung up the telephone and turned a
level stare upon young wilcox and the
girl

  my friends he told them sternly

you are two fools-two mutton-headed
senseless fools how dare you trifle with
the love the good god gives you would
you despise his priceless gift ah bah
i had thought better of you

  but doctor de grandin janet
paynes reply was like a wail i cant do
otherwise im vowed and dedicated to a
life of penance and renunciation he
made me take an oath and-

  a-ah the frenchmans voice cut
through her explanation he made you
hein very good tell us of it if you will
be so kind

  i was a little girl when he first took
me she answered her voice growing
calmer as she spoke my parents and i
were traveling in ecuador when we came
down with fever we were miles from
any city and medical help could not be
had mr folloilott came along while we
were lying at the point of death in a na-
tives hut and nursed us tenderly he
risked his death from fever every mo-
ment he was with us but showed no sign
of fear mother died the day he came
and father realized he had not long to
live so when the kind clergyman offered
to take me as his ward he gladly con-
sented and signed a document mr fol-
loilott prepared then he died

  it was a long long time before i was
strong enough to travel but finally my
strength came back and we got through
to the coast mr folloilott had the paper
father signed validated at the consuls
office then brought me back to this coun-
try i never knew if i had any relatives
or not i know my guardian never looked
for them

  for a long time till i was nearly
twelve years old he never let me leave
the house alone i never had a playmate
and mr folloilott acted as my tutor i
spoke french and spanish fluently and
could read the hardest greek and latin


weird tales

texts at sight before i was eleven and had
gone through calculus when i was twelve
the book of common prayer and the
hymnal were my text-books and i could
repeat every hymn from new every
morning is the love to there is a blessed
home beyond this land of wo by
heart

  mon dieu exclaimed de grandin

pityingly

  when i had reached thirteen he sent
me to a sisters school the girl con-
tinued i boarded there and didnt leave
during vacation so i was much more ad-
vanced than any of the other pupils and
when i was fifteen they sent me home-
back to mr folloilott i mean

  of course coming back to the lonely
rectory with no company but my guardian
was hard after school and i was home-
sick for the convent he noticed it and
one day asked me if i shouldnt like to go
back to carlinville to stay i told him
that i would and-

  she paused a moment and a thought-
ful pucker gathered between her brows
as though an idea had struck her for the
first time why-she exclaimed-
why it was no better than a trick
and-

  eh bien wedo digress mademoi-
sellethe frenchman interrupted with a
smile the evidence first if you please
the verdict afterward you told the rev-
erend gentleman you should like to re-
turn to the good sisters and-

  and then he took me to the church
she answered and led me to the chancel
where he made me stop and turn my
stockings down so that i knelt on my bare
knees while he held a bible out to me
and made me put my hands on it and
swear that i would dedicate myself to
holy poverty chastity and obedience and
as soon as i had reached eighteen would
go to carlinville and enter as a postulant

progressing to the novitiate and finally
making my profession as a nun

   it was shortly after that mr folloi-
lott received the call to norfolk downs

and i met george and- her voice

trailed off and once again sobs choked
her words

de grandin tweaked the ends of his
mustache and smiled a trifle grimly
i wish i had not shot him dead so
quickly he muttered to himself then to
the girl

  a promise such as that is no promise
at all mademoiselle as you yourself
have said it was a trick and a most des-
picable one at that now listen to my
testimony mademoiselle

  when monsieur wilcox called me to
this place to look into these so strange
murders i was most greatly puzzled the
evidence of chief otoole all pointed to
some superphysical agency at work and
as id had much practise as a phantom-
fighter it was for me to say what tactics i
should use for what may rout a ghostly
enemy is often useless when opposed to
human foes while what will kill a hu-
man being dead is useless as a pointed
finger when directed at a spirit you ap-
prehend very good

  so when i learned that monsieur your
guardian with the funny name i can not
say had laid the onus of these killings on
a piece of broken sculpture i was most
greatly interested stranger things had
happened in the past things quite as
strange will doubtless happen in the fu-
ture the theory that the devil was un-
loosed seemed tenable but for one little
single thing every one this devil killed
was some one of an evil life this is the
very devil of a devil jules de grandin
i tell me most times the evil one at-
tacks the good this time the evil one
has singled out the evil for attack it

                       w t- 
the dark angel



does not hang together it has the smell
of fish upon it oui-da but of course

   accordingly i made the careful study
of your guardian he is a very pious
man that much one sees while both his
eyes are closed ha but piety and good-
ness are not of necessity the same by no
means gille de retz the greatest mon-
ster ever clothed in flesh he was a pious
man but far from being good cotton
mather who hanged poor inoffensive
women on the gallows tree he was a
pious man so was torquemada who
fouled the pure air of heaven with the
burnings of the luckless jews in spain
they all were pious-too pious to be
truly good parbleu

  the evening when i met your guard-
ian at dinner i studied him some more
i hear monsieur wilcox tell the young
rabbi that the debt upon his temple is ex-
tended how does monsieur your guard-
ian take that statement it makes him
ill by blue furthermore he has upon
his face the look of one who finds too
late that he had made a great and terrible
mistake the loan would have been called
had not the money-lender died now for
the first time the clergyman finds the
hated jews have profited by the shylocks
death-and he looks as if he were about
to die jules de grandin this are
strange i tell me you must keep the
eye on this one jules de grandin and
jules de grandin i shall do so i reply
to me

   meanwhile he has been at great pains
to tell us all once more that these killings
are the work of righteous heaven is it
more superstition-or something else-
which makes him tell me this one won-
ders

  when he had gone i learn that he
has been a hunter and a mountain-
climber that he has shot a condor down
w t-

in flight ah-ha i say to me what does
this mean if anything

  the police chief has shown to me a
feather clipped by his bullet from the
dreadful being which commits these mur-
ders i have looked at it and recognized
it although it has been metallized by a
process of electro-plating i have recog-
nized it instantly it is the feather of a
condor um-m once more one won-
ders mademoiselle

  and while we sit and talk before the
fire there come the tidings of another
killing monsieur bostwick has been
slain

  we go at once and find him in his
chair dead like a mutton and very peace-
ful in his pose yet all his goods and chat-
tels have been smashed to bits the blow
which killed him had done so instantly
and there is blood to mark the spot where
he fell-yet he sits in his chair i look
around and come to a conclusion the
smashing of the furniture is but a piece
of window-dressing to cover up the man-
ner of the killing

  but who can enter in a house where
all the windows save a single one upon
the second floor are latched strike down
a man then vanish in thin air i ask to
know moreover what was it that was
seen to look into a window ten feet from
the ground i can not answer but the
next day i find that which helps me to-
ward conclusions

  there is blood upon the ground by
monsieur bostwicks house a little tiny
drop it is but i take it that it fell from
off the murderers weapon there axe also
footprints-most extraordinary footprints
-in the soft earth by the house the
murderer have stood here i inform me

   quite so i agree with me but
where was he before he stood there


weird tales

  so up upon the roof i go and there
i find a strand of horsehair i think
monsieur your guardian is a skilled
mountain-climber he had been to south
america in that land the vaqueros or
herdsmen use lariats of plaited horsehair
in their work they find them lighter and
stronger than hemp that i remember
i remember something else a skilled
mountaineer might have lassoed the
chimney of that house have drawn him-
self up to the roof then lowered himself
to the open window of the second-story
room he might have struck down mon-
sieur bostwick from the window then
smashed the furniture to make it seem a
struggle had been had that done he
might have closed the window after him
lowered himself to the ground by his
lariat and made off while no one was the
wiser to disengage the lasso from the
chimney would have been an easy task
i know for i have seen it done when
jutting rocks instead of chimneys held
the mountain-climbers ropes

  as he slid down his rope he looked
into the window of the hall and when
his evil mask was seen they said it was
the devil yes it were entirely possible

  now while i stood upon the roof
seeking that little strand of horsehair
upon which hung my theory who passed
but your good guardian he sees me
there and realizes i am hot upon the ex-
planation of the crime anon he comes
to monsieur wilcoxs house-perhaps to
talk with me and find out what i know
-and i exert myself to be most disagree-
able i wish to sting him into overt
action

  parbleu i have not long to wait this
very night he comes into my room and
would have served me as he did the
others but i am not beneath his hammer
when it falls and good friend trow-

  bridge knocks the wind from him with a
carafe

  and then too late i learn that you
and monsieur georges have the assigna-
tion all well i know how that one will
attack you if he finds you to such an
one the greatest insult is the thwarting of
his will and so i rush to warn you the
rest you know

  the man was mad i exclaimed

  of course replied the frenchman
he was fanatically ascetic and you can-
not make the long nose at dame nature
with impunity my friend as your mon-
sieur john hay has said

      he who nature scorns and mocks
     by nature is mocked and scorned

  he brought his madness on himself
and-

  but that sulfurous blinding fire we
saw-otoole saw it too what was
that

  have you never attended a banquet
my friend he asked with a grin

  a banquet-whatever are you talking

about

  about a banquet parbleu-and about
the photographs they take of such festiv-
ities do you not recall the magnesium
flares the photographers set off to take
their indoor pictures

  you-you mean it was only flashlight
powder i stammered

  only that my friend nothing more
fantastic i assure you blazing in the
dark it blinded those who saw it they
smelled the acrid pungent smoke and
imagination did the rest voila we have
the fires of hell of which the good
otoole did tell us

  young wilcox turned to janet you
see dear he urged that promise was
extracted from you by a trick it cant be
binding and i love you so much-
the dark angel



de grandin interrupted there is an- a blush suffused her face but ill

 other vow that you must take nay child	take that vow if george still wants me

he told the girl solemnly	she replied

a-a vow she faltered why i wants you par la barbe dun cochon

aunted room

by cristel hastings

               what is it that goes creeping through this room

                trailing its dusty garments as it crawls

               why does the air seem like an icy breath
               that penetrates the dim and empty halls 

              they say that death came once into this room-

              that old four-poster in the corner there-

                they whisper too of shrieks that pierce the night

of banging doors and blue light everywhere

               a rose that hung outside the shuttered pane

              withered and died one night when shrill winds moaned-

               the queer blue light hovered a while and then
               the very timbers of the old house groaned

              weeds now run riot in the somber path

                  like snares for careless feet that wander through

but no one comas for no one ventures near -

always there is the dim light pale and blue

the low winds moan even on summer nights-

                  there is a sighing sound in every room

               the mice have full possession of the halls

                 and hold their ghostly dance in shadowed gloom

               they say each night when sane folks clocks strike twelve
               the blue kght glows a whiie through shuttered panes

               and then it is the thing comes crawling back
               and tries to rid the floor of crimson stains

c hantom hand

by victor rousseau

an astounding novel of black magic eery murders and weird occult happenings

h

the story thus far

urrying home to lorna west
to whom he is engaged don
wentworth has the night vision
of her father being executed by hanging
and awakes to find himself choking and
gasping in his stateroom lorna had sum-
moned don a year before when he was
in china begging him to come to her at
once but he was captured by brigands
and held in bondage in the morning
don reads a radio message to the effect
that senator lemuel west has paid the
last penalty of the law

  at san francisco he learns that west
was convicted on circumstantial evidence
of the murder of police captain morse
who had the goods on him and his asso-
ciates he hurries to cannonville where
west had lived and meets one sudh
hafiz a persian in charge of a babist
temple

  hafiz takes don out to the house of
godfrey moore a millionaire in a lonely
part of the country warning him that
moore practises the black art moore is
taking care of lorna who has become
mentally deranged don can see that she
hardly knows him

  moore shows his new television set to
hafiz don and his bootlegger moroni
who had been mixed up in senator wests
affairs don horrified sees in place of
the stage of the grand opera which the
others see the scene of wests hanging
in the penitentiary yard suddenly the
phantom west grows to life size and
leaves the screen moroni cries out

when the lights are turned on he is
found dead with finger-marks about his
throat the story continues

vtou saw the same picture that i
x did demanded don of the per-
sian as the car purred back along the
lonely road across the swamp

  i saw the same and so did moore but
not moroni for he was marked for death
from the beginning and his death was
godfrey moores challenge to us

  you mean to say that moroni was
actually strangled by the phantom asked
don incredulously

  do not forget that you yourself had
a narrow escape on board the president
harrison replied the other yes i
mean to say that godfrey moore finds
himself hard-pressed and probably black-
mailed by his confederates who joined
with him in sending poor west to his
death remember it was at moores own
house that west was drugged and from
that house he was carried back to his own
apartment where the evidence had
already been prepared that was to send
him to the gallows

  who killed captain morse

  i believe the murderer has already
paid the penalty replied sudh hafiz
you mean it was moroni

  in all probability well what is the
situation now the gang believe that
they have moore at their mercy he has
determined to kill them-that is to say
gus walstein the democratic boss of



this story began in wtelkd tales for july
the phantom hand



e ci vt

suddenly he seemed to grow aware of the mocking leering
shadow that stood behind him

cannonville and abner wells the silk-
stocking districts candidate for mayor
last fall moroni is already gone

  but-but how-assuming what you
suggest is correct how could a phantom
kill moroni asked don and why
should west who was sent to his death
by godfrey moore as you claim oblige
him by killing off all the participants in
the conspiracy

  i shall answer your last question
first replied the persian giving the
wheel a twist as the car wabbled danger-
ously near the sucking mud beside the
causeway i likened west to a bull in a
china shop and that is a good simile he
passed out of this life-i know it for i
was with him toward the last-burning
with hatred toward the men who had
railroaded him a simple soul not bad
but primitive and with all primitive
mans loves and hatreds

  now he finds himself in a place of

darkness he does not know just what
has happened to him but he sees a light
and struggles toward it this light is his
daughter lorna who draws him by her
love for him he manages in the clumsy
way of the newly dead to take posses-
sion of her-

  ah exclaimed don

  you saw the transformation of her
face well my friend that very hatred
that he feels toward all his former asso-
ciates enables him to materialize a phan-
tom that strangles moroni

  and why not moore

  moore knows how to protect himself
west is striking out blindly our task
is to bring west to an understanding of
his situation to bid him direct his powers
intelligently in short to make an ally of
him

  don fell silent while the car leaving
the swamp began to take the road bade
through the pine forests


weird tales

  why didnt moore attempt some
trickery against us asked don suddenly

  moore is not omnipotent he had
achieved his purpose-which i may say
i should have prevented had i foreseen
his object he scored a decided victory
over me in that and he knows how to
bide his time

  i wish id insisted on taking lorna
with me don blurted out

  it could not have been done but she
will never come to any harm at moores
hands

  why not

  some day ill tell you answered
sudh hafiz

the car ran on don was revolving
it all over in his mind of course
hafiz was cracked and yet don had
seen too much that night to be any
longer an uncompromising materialist
trickery the whole thing might have
been must have been and yet-

  suppose moroni had died of a sudden
heart attack how could moore have pro-
jected the phantom from the radio and
how could materialism explain the vision
he had seen on board the ship repeated in
every detail in that room he was
aroused by sudh hafizs voice the per-
sian spoke hesitantly almost timidly

  when i told you i believed that
moroni was the murderer of captain
morse i was not entirely frank with you
wentworth he said as a matter of
fact it was moroni who prepared the
stage effects in wests apartment the
circumstantial evidence that condemned
him it was not his hand that struck the
blow

  whose then asked don

  it was lemuel wests answered
hafiz

  what you mean that senator west
actually was the murderer

  not consciously not willingly west
was on intimate terms with moore in a
moment of confidence-and even a man
like moore has his weaknesses-he had
aroused wests interest in the black art
one of the tests of a master the first
test that is required is the ability to sepa-
rate the astral double from the physical
body west had permitted moore to
hypnotize him and to withdraw his astral
little by little moore gained sufficient
control over west to be able to dispatch
his double on errands to force it to obey
his will unquestioningly it is my belief
that on the night of the tragedy while
west was in a drugged sleep at moores
house moore sent his astral to murder
captain morse

  with a gavel asked don incredu-
lously

  have you ever sat at an amateur
seance and seen a table smashed to pieces
by the psychic powers about you

  ive heard of such things but-

  the astral counterpart possesses
strength such as no human being is
capable of wests double smashed
morses skull to pieces the gavel was
part of the evidence manufactured by
moroni

  again don fell into silence but now
he was conscious of a definite resentment
against the persian as we feel resentment
against those who endeavor to shake us
out of our preconceived ideas he said
not another word until the car drew up
outside sudh hafizs house

  youll be my guest tonight

  no im much obliged answered
don but i think ill go to a hotel i
want to mull over all this business

  as you please westworth of course
there may be an inquest but i dont think
so and youre not likely to be called upon
it looks like a simple case of death from
the phantom hand



heart disease may i ask what you are
planning to do

  i think walstein and abner wells
should be warned somehow said don

  it wouldnt do the slightest good
you would simply get yourself in trouble
remember this town is sewed up tight
politically and godfrey moore runs it
come and see me before you do anything
he spoke in persian to the lad who had
appeared and the lad ran back into the
house and returned with dons suitcase

  i beg of you to do nothing until we
have had the opportunity of a further
chat continued sudh hafiz as for a
hotel theres a good one the parmelee
just around the corner on the right may
i drive you there

  no thanks ill walk don answered
i need a breath of air

  i think said sudh hafiz deliberately
that you may receive an important phone
call in the morning if you require a car
please call on my services no taxi driver
would take you out to moores place for
any amount of money

don slept not at all that night but
then he had no desire to sleep the
events that had happened since his arrival
at cannonville hitherto an unassimilated
mass gradually began to assume coherence
in his mind during the long night watch
and the result was a decided hardening
against sudh hafiz

  but that the persian had been the means
of bringing him to lorna don would
have felt an even deeper resentment
against him he was in fact at the part-
ing of the ways either he had to swallow
everything that sudh hafiz had told him
or else he must reject the supernatural
element in toto and like most men in
his position he chose the latter course

  he succeeded in convincing himself

before morning that the picture he had
seen on the radio was the result of an
overwrought brain that the year of
brooding over lorna and the shock of
reading of her fathers execution must
have produced visual hallucinations

  but he was sane enough now he told
himself as he looked from the window of
his bedroom at the street with its bright
lights and the winking electric signs in
the amusement district a few blocks away

  sane enough to make his plans these
centered for the present exclusively
about lorna to hunt down the men
who had sent lemuel west to his death
and clear her name-that was secondary
but first he resolved to get lorna out of
an environment which he was convinced
was retarding her recovery he did not
altogether trust godfrey moore and he
did not believe that lorna was getting
the right sort of treatment in his home

  he determined to go out again in the
morning and see lorna and ask her to
become his wife she had promised to
marry him as soon as he returned from
china even if she was mentally ill who
had a stronger right than he to undertake
the task of caring for her

  with which resolution don lit a pipe
and waited for the coming of dawn

  it came at last and don had a good
hot bath shaved and dressed he was
feeling pretty fit in spite of the nights
experiences he was about to go down
to breakfast when his telephone rang

  this is godfrey moore came the
voice how are you after last nights dis-
tressing experience wentworth

  im feeling about as well as could be
expected answered don

  thats good well im phoning you
about lorna im sorry to say shes had
rather a bad relapse in fact i had my
physician out here soon after you left
and he thinks she should be removed to


weird tales

some institution where she can haye com-
plete rest

  when do you propose to move her
queried don

  ive already engaged a room for her
at the state institution for the insane
came moores voice in bland tones

  don was horrified a public institu-
tion he demanded

  yes and an excellent one i am one
of the governing body

  id like to see her-and you-first
by all means my dear fellow come
out as soon as you like in fact the soon-
er the better ive already arranged for a
nurse to come out here and take her away
on the afternoon train

all dons resentment against sudh
hafiz had disappeared with this
conversation his fears for lorna rose
paramount he snatched a mouthful of
breakfast and hurried round to the per-
sians house where he found sudh hafiz
smoking a cigarette over the morning
paper something in the mans manner
indicated to don that he had been await-
ing him

  don recounted the telephone conversa-
tion i cant understand it he said
apparently he proposes to wash his
hands of her sinee hes sending her to a
public institution of course i wont tol-
erate it ive got a few thousand put by
and im going right out to ask her to
marry me do you think ill have any
trouble with moore

  i should say not the slightest
answered sudh hafiz in fact i think he
was just baiting a hook to get you to do
exactly that

  you mean you think he wants me to
marry her asked don

  i think he wants to get her-and you
-out of his immediate course godfrey
moore is playing a shrewd game and like

all the best strategists he doesnt believe
in taking on too many adversaries at
once

  im going right out there i remem-
bered your kind offer of a car by the
way you seemed to anticipate my receiv-
ing an important telephone call

  yes smiled the persian in his enig-
matic way don knew it was useless to
question him

   may as well admit to you that last
night i- he began

  my dear sir it is unnecessaty to tell
me that you westerners have not the
oriental faculty of keeping the face from
expressing the thoughts and you stiil
believe that i am-may i say unhinged

  frankly i dont know what i be-
lieve answered don all i want is to
get lorna out of godfrey moores
clutches

  and i dont anticipate the slightest
difficulty as i was saying answered
hafiz i can start with you right away

  three minutes later the two were again
on the road running out toward the house
about half-way however a strange
vehicle appeared among the trees coming
in their direction it turned out to be a
motor-hearse sudh hafiz slowed down
and signalled the driver to stop

  youve got mr moronis body in-
side he asked

  yep got a call a coupla hours ago
the coroner was there and said there
didnt need to be no inquest since it was
a case of heart disease but say i
wouldnt trust myself in that there
hanted house at night for all the money
in the world i seen a feller killed by
hants once before and he looked jest
like moroni-fleck of foam on his lips
and all the horrors of hell in his eyes
yep and between you and me heart
disease dont leave finger-prints on the
throat but it aint my business and i
the phantom hand



aint interferin im jest tellin you mr
halffish because my wife goes to your
temple

  id keep it strictly to yourself if i
were you said sudh hafiz and the
driver nodded and started the hearse
again

don had queer premonitions of dis-
aster long before the house came
into sight so that it was almost a shock
to him to see it standing just as it had
been on the night before hafiz drew
up at the door and rang the bell but
the peal which could be heard within the
house elicited no answer he rang again
with like result and looked at don as if
in perplexity

  weve got to get in said don look-
ing about him he saw that one of the
windows on the ground floor was not
quite closed and that a solid trunk of
creeper ran upward past the sill he set
foot on it and quickly scrambled up
sudh hafiz following him

  it was only the work of a moment to
push the window up and drop to the
floor inside the two found themselves
in a pantry with the kitchen leading off
it they hurried through and saw the
series of drawing-rooms in front of them

  a faint groaning became audible don
ran through the blue velvet portieres on
the floor of the room in which they had
sat the evening before lay godfrey
moore he was tightly trussed and
gagged but his eyes were open and
from the violent attempts to free himself
that he was making it did not seem that
his injuries were very serious ones

  don pulled out a pocket-knife and
slashed the gag over his mouth and god-
frey moore instantly became violently
vocal

  wheres lorna cried don

  gone spluttered godfrey he took

her with him that poor insane girl he
must have been mad himself to dare at-
tempt this outrage

  who

  who gus walstein the political
boss of cannonville and one of lemuel
wests most intimate associates ill show
him whos got more power here
ill-

  where has he taken her what does
he mean to do with her cried don
while sudh hafiz took the pocket-knife
from his hand and began cutting at the
tablecover which ripped into strips had
been used to truss up moore very effi-
ciently tell me what happened quick
gus walstein came here about an
hour ago hed heard of moronis sud-
den death last night and he believed mo-
roni had been carrying certain papers that
would implicate walstein in the murder
of captain morse and that id got hold
of them he knows ive been at work
ever since the trial trying to bring gus
walstein to justice i know his was the
guiding hand behind that murder con-
tinued moore his old glibness of speech
rapidly returning to him

  he came here just after the coroner
and the hearse-driver had left must have
been waiting for them to go he threat-
ened me with death unless i gave up
those papers i told him id taken no
papers from moroni and that i wouldnt
give them up if i had then he struck
me over the head with some blunt in-
strument and half stunned me

  don glanced at godfrey moores head
but saw no signs of any contusions still
that proved nothing

  tell me about lorna he said trying
to keep his voice steady

  she came into the room half-dazed
i was barely conscious and walstein was
going through my pockets he seemed
desperate and when he saw her i think


weird tales

he got some sort of idea that she knew
where the papers were or else he may
have thought he was holding her as a
hostage or to prevent her giving evidence
that he had attacked me he may have
thought i was dead and anyway he was
not in the frame of mind to reason

  he took her away with him and she
made no resistance poor girl shes been
little more than an automaton since that
unfortunate affair last night

  wheres his place his home his
hangout shouted don

  you wont find him in any of those
places but i can guess where hes gone
mike moroni had a place at the head of
the creek an old trappers cabin in the
marshes that he rebuilt and used in his
rum-running operations i think hes
gone there to ransack it

  i know it said sudh hafiz

  but its no use following him there
walsteins desperate more than likely
hes brought some of his gang with him
theyll shoot without hesitation

  by this time sudh hafiz had got god-
frey moore free of his bonds the mil-
lionaire got up stiffly rubbing his head
ill phone the police he said and
have the place surrounded theyll be
out here in a couple of hours at

most-

  i think not answered don decisively
im going to get lorna and every min-
ute is important

  if you could save her poor girl the
nurse will be out here for her this after-
noon it will be a terrible weight off my
mind if i can turn her over to her un-
harmed

  lorna is not going to be turned over
to any nurse or sent to any institution
said don speaking as calmly as he could
weve been engaged nearly two years
and she promised to marry me as soon as
i returned from china if i am fortunate

enough to get her out of gus walsteins
clutches im going to take her straight
into cannonville and marry her

  godfrey moores eyes lit up you
mean that wentworth he cried eagerly

  you dont intend to offer any objec-
tion

  not the least in the world it will be
the only possible solution of the problem
about her for i have felt my own re-
sponsibilities very keenly i congratulate
you on your fine sense of honor went-
worth

  i love her answered don simply
but thawing under moores praise de-
spite his suspicions of the man which
had been growing steadily

  but let me phone the police any-
way persisted the millionaire you
are running up against a desperate gang
-two gangs walsteins and moronis
no but are you armed i have a re-
volver in my desk which walstein over-
looked

  he crossed the room and pressing a
secret spring somewhere in the large ma-
hogany desk opened a drawer and took
out a handy-looking forty-five revolver
which he placed in dons hands

  its loaded in every chamber he
said i wish you better luck than i had
with walstein i shall await the first news
from you with the greatest anxiety

t t is only about four miles from here
said sudh hafiz as they got into the
car but this road ends a mile farther
on and we shall probably have to walk
there is only a trail along the shore
dont be alarmed for her wentworth
of course you see now that the whole
business was a fake

  i got the idea that moore tied him-
self up or had some one tie him up de-
liberately answered don but i dont
yet see-
the phantom hand



  more than that moore sent lorna
west with walstein and she accom-
panied him because as moore said she
was in a condition of automatism wal-
stein was the dupe moore sent her under
some pretext that would be very accepta-
ble to walstein who appreciates the com-
pany of a pretty woman but he wont
dare harm her just keep cool and well
save her i think i know which way
moores mind is working only keep
cool wentworth-remember last night
and keep cool whatever happens

  but what was moores purpose
walstein replied the persian is
the second of the trio whom moore has
marked for death and only a miracle can
save him now certainly i could not if i
would for the forces that godfrey moore
has set in motion can not be stayed
there was an intense solemnity in the
persians manner of speaking that almost
convinced don in spite of himself

  you mean that lorna is taking wal-
stein to his death he asked

  yes but not consciously she is a
mere agent of the evil powers

   once i get her in my hands ill never
let her go again said don all this is
enigmatic to me how many men do you
suppose we shall meet at moronis
place

   it makes no difference you shall get
lorna west back unharmed if you will
be guided by me answered sudh hafiz

  don sat beside him in silence it was
impossible to believe in sudh hafizs
prophecies and yet they had an uncanny
knack of being fulfilled he took refuge
from bis doubts in thoughts of lorna
to save her make her his wife restore
her reason-that was all that mattered
immediately and the rest could wait

  will you tell me why you think
moore told us where walstein was to be

found and why he gave me this gun
he asked suddenly

  sudh hafiz shrugged his shoulders
he knows you are to be his most power-
ful enemy he answered therefore to
send you against walstein and to send
you armed is a mere matter of policy
if either of you kills the other he is that
much better off there is nothing deep or
esoteric in that

   the end of the concrete road came sud-
denly into view beyond it was a mere
track winding along the shore an im-
passable muddy trail so far as the car was
concerned there was a circle of con-
crete for turning on and sudh hafiz
rounded it and parked the machine facing
in the direction of cannonville

  were in for a brisk walk-and a
brisk shower i think he said glancing
up at the sky

the mud was ankle-deep after they
had proceeded a hundred yards or
so don stopped suddenly walstein
never brought lorna this way this morn-
ing he said there are no footprints
in front of us besides where did he
leave his car

  we passed his car returning to can-
nonville just after leaving answered the
persian it was empty save for the
driver evidently he sent it back there-
fore he must have gone to moronis place
in godfrey moores gasoline launch
which as a matter of fact i did not see
in its usual place on the sea-front he
concluded smiling forgive me went-
worth but i saw no reason to trouble you
with all these details well find them at
moronis place i hope theyre there by
now for the girls sake for this looks
more like a storm than a shower he
added

   as he spoke the whips of the rain be-
gan to lash them an immense dark thun-


weird tales

dercioud rolled muttering overhead the
stinging rain became almost a cloudburst
and it grew steadily in violence in a few
moments don and hafiz were soaked to
the skin

  the wind roared from the sea driving
it in great breakers upon the flats and
sending showers of drenching spray
across the road which here ran close to
the waters edge the two men shivered
as they trudged through the muddy
swamp it was almost as dark as mid-
night

  i hope theyve not been caught out at
sea in this storm said don

  the sea hasnt had time to grow
rough yet answered sudh hafiz and
theres the creek he added pointing to
an inlet beyond a headland

  they ascended it steadily the wind
growing worse as they advanced at the
top they were hardly able to keep their
feet so violent was the gale but the
darkness was slowly dissipating and
looking down they could see the cabin
at the head of the creek which was filled
with dark churning oily water and the
motor-launch drawn up beside it as well
as a larger vessel evidently used by mo-
roni in his rum-running expeditions

  a trail led down from the headland
toward the cabin which was fringed at
the rear with a repulsive-looking low
scrub

  i think wed best keep under cover of
that said don pointing no need to
advertise our approach and its getting
light

  sudh hafiz agreed they left the trail
and made their way toward the cabin by
a circuitous route among the great boul-
ders that studded the sides of the head-
land in a little while they had reached
the scrub and found a trail running
through it in the direction of the cabin
the darkness had now become a sort of

twilight the violence of the storm had
ceased but the rain still fell in sheets

  a light was shining through the single
window in the rear of the cabin as if
from a candle there was a rear door
too and silhouetted against the panes the
two could see the shadows of men-sev-
eral men who seemed to be gesticulating
violently

  creeping out of the scrub up to the
rear door don and sudh hafiz stood
the former fingering the revolver that
godfrey moore had given him through
the ill-fitting door they could hear every
word that was spoken within

  you leave the girl alone rumbled a
mans bass voice dummy yeah and
she aint pretendin neither godfrey
said for to take her down into the base-
ment and shell maybe git a spark of rea-
son there seein she follered moroni
there that night to try to git him to save
her dad thats what drove her bug-
house godfrey says its the only chance
to git her to remember what she knows
to put her in the same place as where she
got the shock

  shock how come shock asked an-
other voice with a sneer

  wasnt it a shock to the girl when she
caught moroni sortin out his papers and
he refused to help save her dads life
hed have killed her then and there if
godfrey hadnt been trailin him thats
what godfrey told me anyways but hes a
slick liar however were goin to search
this basement from end to end

  and sposin we say you aint asked
a third voice unless you come across
with a coupla grand each

  the answer came in an inaudible snarl
don knew that this speaker must be wal-
stein and whatever he said it seemed to
beat down the others opposition effec-
tively for the reply came in a grudging
whisper of assent there seemed to be
the phantom hand



four men within the cabin two of them
apparently walstein and one of his aides
from town while the two others were
evidently part of moronis crew of rum-
runners

  smart idea of moronis diggin this
basement for his stock came walsteins
voice nobodyd guess there was a con-
crete foundation under this mud cus-
toms guys wouldnt find it in a score of
years

  the candle flickered walsteins steps
could be heard as he moved about inside
the hut and he was evidently carrying
the candle for it changed its position as
he moved

  see there benny he said to his as-
sistant now who in hell would guess
there was a flight of steps behind this
plank moroni had a head on him pity
he croaked last night

  croaked grinned the other youre
woozy mr walstein croaked yeah
but who croaked him that godfrey
moore is a damn sight too slick for my
taste why didnt he come with us you
took his word for it that there wasnt no
papers on moroni its my belief he
croaked him somehow and hes gettin
away with the goods

  listen growled walstein godfrey
knows if anything happened to me i got
evidence enough to put him where west
went savvy he wouldnt have sent me
here on a fools errand unless he was
aimin to croak me and whos goin to
croak me here them two bums over
there hey you two get down the stairs
and well follow you and if you got any
fancy stunts roamin round in your heads
fergit them

the voices faded as if the four were
going down into the basement when
all was silent don put his hand on the
door but sudh hafiz stopped him
take care he whispered i do not

like this i can not rely on ambuscades
or my powers go i do not know-it is
all misty-

  don without answering him opened
the door quietly and stepped inside it
was all dark and his first impression was
that the upper floor of the cabin was
empty

  then a step sounded close beside him
and as he whirled a figure leaped at him
out of the darkness he felt the violent
impact of some weapon upon his head
he tried to raise his revolver but his
hand was powerless and he went plung-
ing down into darkness

how long don was out he bad no
idea but it could not have been very
long he came back to himself with a
racking pain in his head to find himself
tied up with ropes and seated in a comer
of a cellar not far away was sudh hafiz
similarly tied four men were in the cel-
lar two of whom were searching among
a heap of papers at the foot of an over-
turned desk by the light of the candle
the two others were lounging sullenly
near

  and then don saw lorna she was
seated in a chair unbound her eyes star-
ing in front of her as lifeless as if she
had been a waxen figure

  so youre snappin out of it huh
asked one of the two loungers speaking
with an italian accent and coming up to
don

  it was easy to distinguish the two as
the late moronis assistants while wal-
stein was self-evident in the burly form
in the flashy suit snarling over the papers
the man beside him was a flash city
crook evidently his aide the farther end
of the cellar was stocked with cases

  snappin out are they jeered wal-
stein rising and coming toward don i
reckon i know you mister wentworth


weird tales

snoopin on me huh whadya expect to
find who yuh workin for-godfrey
moore or mebbe you heard your broad
had taken a fancy to me and come here
with me huh

  he kicked don savagely in the side
with his heavy shoe and shook his fist in
dons face

  listen bo you and the dago parson
have got just about half an hour to live
im holdin you till ive gone through
moronis papers in case im goin to need
you but dont bank on that moronis
dead and this place is goin to be your
tomb and these two fellers are goin to
help croak you so there wont be no one
to give evidence and that goes for you
too he said kicking sudh hafiz in the
ribs

  dont be too sure mr walstein an-
swered the persian in an even voice
sometimes the wisest of us are mis-
taken

  walstein raised his foot again with an
oath looked into sudh hafizs face and
set it down again cursing he turned
away

  lets get this business over benny
he said to his assistant gimme a drink
some one

  one of the two rum-runners ran to an
open case and pulled out a bottle he
dexterously knocked off the glass rim at
the top without uncorking it and handed
it to walstein who took a deep drink
each of the others drank in turn the last
emptying the bottle and flinging it against
the wall breaking it in pieces walstein
and benny resumed their task while the
two others lounging by the wall began
to chatter in italian

  the little light of the candle barely
illuminated the vault outside its periph-
eiy all was shadow don staring at
loraa could hardly see her face she

seemed in a state of profound uncon-
sciousness

  he was quietly working at the ropes
that bound him tight as they were he
had managed to relax them sufficiently to
get his fingers about what seemed to be
the main knot but he was still partly
paralyzed by the blow upon the head that
he had received and was perforce com-
pelled to desist until he could gather a
little more of his strength

  he sat there trying to pull himself to-
gether but suddenly a gasp came from
his lips something was happening to
lorna her face her form were growing
misty

a cry of exultation broke from wal-
steins lips as after looking through
and tossing aside paper after paper he
held one close up to the candle-flame

  benny i got something he shouted
heres godfrey moores signature to
that note to abner wells thatll hold
the feller for a time

  he laid the paper aside with two or
three others that he had selected and fell
to work with renewed haste but dons
eyes were fixed on lorna a faint lam-
bent light was beginning to play about
her features a light that appeared to be
invisible to the two italians close beside
her for they were chattering to each other
and glancing malevolently at walstein
and benny sorting the papers on the
floor

  by that light don could see to his hor-
ror a singular and fearful change pro-
ceeding lorna seemed to be awaking
from her sleep or trance but it was like
the awaking of a dead person it was
like a corpse coming back to life

  slowly her eyelids were unclosing
slowly the vacant look of the features was
vanishing and slowly there came an ex-
the phantom hand



pression on the face and as on the
night before in moores drawing-room a
mask of hatred was spreading over the
sweet countenance-a mask of such
abominable hatred that don shuddered
at the sight of it and again as before
the features were slowly and in some in-
explicable way taking on the lineaments
of the face of lemuel west as don re-
membered it

  it was the most terrific metamorphosis
that don had ever seen it made him for-
get his bonds his danger and he could
only crouch where he was and watch that
awful change that was taking place in the
woman he loved

  he believed now he believed every-
thing that sudh hafiz had told him in
that moment all his preconceptions all his
materialism broke down in the light of
stunning reality

  that look on lornas face would have
appalled the bravest man who ever lived
and yet none of the four seemed to see
what was happening they could not
even see the steady bluish glow that threw
the girls face into clear relief

  only the persian sudh hafiz saw it
and he conveyed this knowledge by the
faintest gesture as he half turned his face
toward dons for a moment

  but another change was taking place
in lorna for her outlines were growing
momentarily more hazy a swirling mist
seemed to be enveloping her it was coil-
ing up from her face from her body
eddying and revolving in front of her and
above her illumined by that same lam-
bent light and still none of the four
was aware of it it was incredible but
it was true

  the mist was thickening condensing
it was gradually assuming the shape of a
huge egg swaying and rotating in front
of the girl the egg bisected into two

unequal parts from the upper and lower
part respectively there issued two projec-
tions that became ill-defined arms and
legs

  the mist was assuming human form
-it was becoming a man-the form of
the dead man lemuel west

  don bit his tongue to keep from cry-
ing out in his horror as the figure of
west became momentarily more clearly
defined it faced lorna not flesh and
yet not phantom but more phantom than
flesh a tenuous outline a stealthy
shadow that was gradually assuming per-
sonality awaking to life as lorna once
more relapsed into trance drawing upon
her vitality to give itself fictitious exist-
ence

  lornas face relaxed it became placid
gentle the look of hatred that she had
worn was now transferring itself to the
face of the phantom there stood lemuel
west the very incarnation of evil pas-
sions his hands clenched his head lolling
crookedly upon his shoulder on lornas
face was now the waxen mask of sleep
or trance-or death she had sunk back
into her chair

  now don could see what looked like
a thick band of radiant light connecting
the bodies of father and daughter the
phantom bobbed and swayed and with
each movement the cord seemed to be
elongated it was beginning to thin at
the middle it waned to the thinness of
a hair it snapped and the phantom
floated free

  lemuel west stood before his daugh-
ter don could see the glowing eyes of
the phantom fixed on her pale face and
for just an instant the look of hatred
seemed to change to one of pity or love
and in that moment the phantoms out-
lines seemed to shrink and lorna stirred
and faintly smiled

  but the next moment lemuel west


weird tales

stood there again the same look of hate
upon his face and lorna had subsided
into her death-like trance once more

  lemuel west turned slowly in the
direction of the two men who were sort-
ing papers upon the floor at that mo-
ment gus walstein raised his head
looked straight at the phantom-and saw
nothing

  well were almost through hey
you two dagoes bring some more drink
he shouted drunkenly

  one of the two italians began moving
toward the broken case that contained the
whisky-bottlcs he took another bottle
and brought it back to walstein and he
walked straight through the phantom
and never saw it

gus walstein raised the bottle to his
lips tilted back his head and took a
long drink he handed it to benny

  well we aint got all we want but
we got something he shouted les go
through this last pile and then well fix
them two butters-in here

  he reeled and again squatted down
on the floor sorting the last batch of
moronis papers by the light of the candle

  it was burning low and the long red-
tipped wick sent up a wavering flame and
a stench of grease tt broke off leaving
only a tiny fragment in the tallow to
which the little flame clung trying to re-
establish itself the cellar was almost
dark

  don saw the two italians looking
malevolently at walstein and his com-
panion he saw the specter raise its hand
and point toward them one of the two
men raised his head and his hand
dropped to his belt

  walstein cursed at the darkness still
neither he nor any of the others seemed
aware of the shadow flitting to and fro

between them like a bobbin on a loom
as if weaving some fearful net that was
to entrap them yet it had come into
clearer relief against the darkness as if it
were darker than the darkness

  and now straining his horrified eyes
don watched lemuel west gaining
strength and power at first he had
crouched and swayed like a man seeking
to gain his foothold then a succession
of tremors had run through the shadowy
form and all at once it had grown vigor-
ous vital gorilla-like and lomas body
had become still more shrunken until
she looked like a child-like the waxen
effigy of a child

  lemuel west was advancing toward
walstein with clenched fists now he was
standing immediately behind him one
arm upraised walstein looked up

  well that finishes the pile benny
he said br-r-r its cold here

  the arm fell walstein yelped stag-
gered to his feet and stood swaying and
clutching at his heart

  they got me benny he yelled get
them the-s

  quick as a flash the man benny
whirled gun in hand the roar of the
discharge followed and one of the two
italians screeched and stumbled forward
recovered himself and whipped out a
knife he and his companion flung them-
selves upon benny

  walstein had got a gun from his
pocket he fired but the bullet went
wild and the next moment the four were
engaged in a desperate melee while
behind them stood the phantom arm still
upraised a leer upon its shadowy face

  yelling and cursing the four strug-
gled to and fro a murder-knot that twined
and unfastened disclosing knives that
flashed in the candle-light and guns that
roared and sent up coils of acrid smoke

                    w t-
the phantom hand



bennys gun spoke three times in quick
succession and one of the italians
dropped half his face blown away but
the next instant his companions knife
flashed and benny dropped a fearful
gaping wound in his chest

   moaning like a wounded dog he rolled
over and over until he came to rest at
dons feet he looked up at him his
features twisted in a spasm of fearful
baffling hate and fear and died

   walstein and the second italian were
locked in a death struggle each trying
to get a grip on the others hand and
both bleeding from half a dozen wounds
don saw walstein wrench his hand free
place the revolver to the italians head
and pull the trigger but the hammer
fell on an empty cartridge and the next
moment the italians knife went home

   shrieking like a fiend walstein poised
his great bulk seized the italian in his
arms ignoring the flashing knife whidi
struck home again and again and with
the exercise of all his strength he broke
the man in two raised him and hurled
the limp quivering body against the
wall it fell thudding to the floor neck
and back broken

  walstein stood rocking like a giant
tree about to fall the blood streaming
down his body and suddenly he seemed
to grow aware of the mocking leering
shadow that stood behind him

  he turned the dead man and the
dying one glared into each others eyes
a yell of horror broke from walsteins
lips

  you he shrieked you-you-
you

  the phantoms lips parted and it
seemed to don as if there passed from
them some message that he could not
hear walsteins eyes grew lurid with
horror then filmed and with a crash the
w t-

boss of cannonville dropped dead among
the three dead men

  all the while don had been working
intermittently at his bonds now he felt
the knot begin to loosen in his fingers
and suddenly inexplicably he was free
he staggered to his feet his head was
reeling and he could only faintly see the
outlines of the phantom in the flickering
candle-light

  but he saw it tum toward him with
hate-distorted face and raise its arm
then of a sudden the arm dropped and
the next moment lemuel west was no
longer diere but the swirl of mist was
again coiling about lornas body

  and lorna seemed to be growing
larger she looked more life-like too
her features were no longer a waxen
effigy and she stirred and sighed

don staggered to the side of sudh
hafiz the persian looked up at him
impassively don tried to find the knot
in the cord that bound him but to his
amazement saw that he was free

   sudh hafiz smiled and rose to his feet
he put out one hand and caught don
as he swayed

   i would have saved them he said
but it would have meant to reverse the
inexorable workings of divine retribution
you believe in me now wentworth
youll work with me to save lorna and
to stamp out this nest of deviltry

   ill work with you to the end don
answered and he staggered toward
lorna and gathered her into his arms

   she was awake she sat up in her chair
she looked at him but there was no recog-
nition in her eyes which only staled
blankly before her

  dont you know me dear asked
don ive come to take you away

   she rose to her feet obediently but no


weird tales

word came from her lips suddenly an
exclamation broke from sudh hafiz

  take care wentworth he cried
face them walk backward to the door
dont let them get behind you and theyll
be powerless

  don swung about by the faint light
of the candle he could see four swirling
shapes slowly materializing above the
bodies of the four dead men

  three of them seemed to hover uncer-
tainly as if unable to take form but the
fourth had already assumed walsteins
outlines and was crouching with clenched
fists as if about to strike while the lips
were drawn back in a bestial snarl

  suddenly the thing leaped and don
felt as if he had been plunged into an icy
bath he struck at it and his fist passed
through the phantom

  he whirled as it tried to leap behind
him somehow he knew that if it could
strike from behind he would be dead in
a moment he saw sudh hafiz at his side
he lifted lorna in his arms step by step
they fought their way backward until
they reached the cellar entrance backing
to the stairs the persian shut the door
upon the interior

  now make for the open wentworth
he shouted

                             

  a few moments later don set lorna
down outside the cabin and tried to pull
himself together

it must have been hardly later than
noon but the same strange dim twi-
light hung over land and sea and sul-
furous yellow clouds were heavy in the
sky sudh hafiz came up to don

  were safe for the present he said
that was a shrewd stroke of moores
but it had small chance of success wal-
steins hate might have enabled him to
strike home had he had a little experi-
ence but you cant expect a man to be

able to kill within a few minutes after his
death

  i told you he added seeing don
didnt understand that moore had
trained wests double so that it was able
to travel at will to obey his commands
and even to kill captain morse with a
blow by the aid of the same infernal
power he was able to control walsteins
phantom after his death but walstein
had neither the strength nor the knowl-
edge we shall meet him again a dead
man is more potent for evil than a living
one where are you thinking of taking
lorna

  anywhere away from here said don

  youd better bring her to my house
for the present dont be alarmed at her
condition once weve destroyed that
vipers nest i think shell be her old self
again he pointed to the boat we
can pull round the shore to the car he
said and be in cannonville in a couple
of hours

  suppose moore has taken our car

  sudh hafiz smiled he doesnt work
that way hes thrown the dice and won
-and lost won because he got rid of
walstein lost because i have the papers
walstein had sorted out and moore
who was an interested spectator of the
whole proceedings knows that the issues
are now fairly joined between us

  moore-saw

  yes that was not difficult in his
akashic mirror which shows past pres-
ent and a short way into the future of
which more later now wentworth the
first thing necessary is to get this girl to
my house and then well plan our course
of action

ever ard simon had a weird experience in flatbush when his shoes were caked
with blood and forest mold from the slaying of jerry the wolf

there were blood stains on ever-
ard simons shoes   

simons father had given up his
country house in rye when his wife died
and moved into an apartment in flatbush
among the rising apartment houses which
were steadily replacing the original rural
atmosphere of that residential section of
swelling brooklyn

  blood stains-and forest mold-on his
shoes

  the younger simon-he was thirty-
seven his father getting on toward sev-
enty-always spent his winters in the
west indies returning in the spring go-
ing back again in october he was a pop-
ular writer of informative magazine ar-
ticles as soon as his various visits for
week-ends and odd days were concluded
he would move his trunks into the flat-
bush apartment and spend a week or two
sometimes longer with his father there
was a room for him in the apartment and
this he would occupy t til it was time for
him to leave for his dimmer camp in
the adirondacks early in september he
would repeat the process always ending
his autumn stay in the united states with
his father until it was time to sail back to
st thomas or martinique or wherever he
imagined he could write best for that par-
ticular winter

  there was only one drawback in this
arrangement this was the long ride in
the subway necessitated by his dropping
in to his new york club every day the

copyright  by

 club was his real american headquarters
 there he received his mail there he
 usually lunched and often dined as well
 it was at the club that he received his
 visitors and his telephone calls the club
 was on forty-fourth street and to get
 there from the apartment he walked to
 the church avenue subway station
 changed at de kalb avenue and then
 took a times square express train over the
 manhattan bridge the time consumed
 between the door of the apartment and
 the door of the club was exactly three-
 quarters of an hour barring delays for
 the older man the arrangement was ideal
 he could be in his office he boasted in
 twenty minutes

   to avoid die annoyances of rush hours
 in the subway mr simon senior com-
 monly left home quite early in the morn-
 ing about seven oclock he was a me-
 thodical person always leaving before
 seven in the morning and getting his
 breakfast in a downtown restaurant near
 the office everard simon rarely left the
 apartment until after nine thus avoiding
 the morning rush-hour at its other end
 during the five or six weeks every year
 that they lived together the two men
 really saw little of each other although
 strong bonds of understanding affection
 and respect bound them together some-
 times the older man would awaken his son
 early in the morning for a brief conversa-
 tion occasionally the two would have a
 meal together evenings or on sundays
 now and then an evening would be spent

weird tales

in each others company they had little
to converse about during the day they
would sometimes call each other up and
speak together briefly on the telephone
from club to office or office to club on
the day when everard simon sailed south
his father and he always took a farewell
luncheon together somewhere downtown
on the day of his return seven months
later his father always made it a point to
meet him at the dock these arrange-
ments had prevailed for eleven years he
must get that blood wiped off blood
how-

  during that period the neighborhood
of the apartment had changed out of all
recognition open lots community tennis-
courts and many of the older one-family
houses had disappeared to be replaced by
the ubiquitous apartment houses in 
the neighborhood which had been almost
rural when the older simon had taken up
his abode twenty minutes from his wall
street office was solidly built up except
for an occasional and now incongruous
frame house standing lonely and dwarfed
in its own grounds among the towering
apartment houses like a lost child in a
preoccupied crowd of adults whose busi-
ness caused them to look over the childs
head

one evening not long before the end
of his autumn sojourn in flatbush
everard simon having dined alone in his
club started for the times square subway
station about a quarter before nine
doubled together lengthwise and press-
ing the pocket of his coat out of shape
was a magazine out that day which con-
tained one of his articles he stepped on
board a waiting sea beach express train
in the rearmost car sat down and opened
the magazine looking down the table of
contents to find his article the train
started after the ringing of the warning

bell and the automatic closing of the side
doors while he was putting on his read-
ing-spectacles he began on the article

  he was dimly conscious of the slight
bustle of incoming passengers at broad-
way and canal street and again when the
train ran out on the manhattan bridge be-
cause of the change in the light but his
closing of the magazine with a page-
corner turned down and the replacing of
the spectacles in his inside pocket when
the train drew in to de kalb avenue
were almost entirely mechanical he could
make that change almost without thought
he had to cross the platform here at de
kalb avenue get into a brighton beach
local train the brighton beach expresses
ran only in rush hours and he almost
never travelled during those periods

  he got into his train found a seat and
resumed his reading he paid no atten-
tion to the stations-atlantic and seventh
avenues the next stop after that pros-
pect park would give him one of his me-
chanical signals like coming out on the
bridge the train emerged from its tun-
nel at prospect park only to re-enter it
again at parkside avenue the next fol-
lowing station after that came church
avenue where he got out every evening

  as the train drew in to that station he
repeated the mechanics of turning down a
page in the magazine replacing his spec-
tacles in their case and putting the case in
his inside pockef his mind entirely on
the article he got up left the train
walked back toward the caton avenue
exit started to mount the stairs

  a few moments later he was walking
his mind still entirely occupied with his
article in the long-familiar direction of
his fathers apartment

  the first matter which reminded him
of his surroundings was the contrast in
his breathing after the somewhat stuffy
air of the subway train consciously he
no eye-witnesses



drew in a deep breath of the fresh sweet
outdoor air there was a spicy odor of
wet leaves about it somehow it seemed
as he noticed his environment with the
edge of his mind darker than usual the
crossing of church and caton avenues
was a brightly lighted corner possibly
something was temporarily wrong with
the lighting system he looked up great
trees nodded above his head he could see
the stars twinkling above their lofty tops
the sickle edge of a moon cut sharply
against black branches moving gently in a
fresh wind from the sea

  he walked on several steps before he
paused slackened his gait then stopped
dead his mind responding in a note of
quiet wonderment

  great trees stood all about him from
some distance ahead a joyous song in a
manly bass slightly muffled by the wood
of the thick trees came to his ears it was
a song new to him he found himself
listening to it eagerly the song was en-
tirely strange to him the words unfamil-
iar he listened intently the singer came
nearer he caught various words eng-
lish words he distinguished merry
and heart and repine

   it seemed entirely natural to be here
and yet as he glanced down at his brown
clothes his highly polished shoes felt the
magazine bulging his pocket the edge of
his mind caught a note of incongruity he
remembered with a smile that strange
drawing of aubrey beardsleys of a lady
playing an upright cottage pianoforte in
the midst of a field of daisies he stood
he perceived in a kind of rough path
worn by long usage the ground was
damp underfoot already his polished
shoes were soiled with mold

  the singer came nearer and nearer
obviously as the fresh voice indicated it
was a young man just as the voice
presaged that before many seconds the

singer must come out of the screening ar-
ray of tree boles everard simon was
startled by a crashing quite near by at his
right the singer paused in the middle of
a note and for an instant there was a
primeval silence undisturbed by the rustle
of a single leaf

  then a huge timber wolf burst through
the underbrush to the right paused
crouched and sprang in a direction diag-
onal to that in which everard simon waj
facing toward the singer

startled into a frigid immobility si-
mon stood as though petrified he
heard an exclamation in the singers
voice a quick heh then the sound of
a struggle the great wolf apparently
had failed to knock down his quarry
then without warning the two figures
man and wolf came into plain sight the
singer for so simon thought of him a
tall robust fellow in fringed deerskin
slashing desperately with a hunting-knife
the beast crouching now snapping with a
tearing motion of a great punishing jaw
short-breathed hehs came from the
man as he parried dexterously the lashing
snaps of the wicked jaws

  the two revolving about each other
came very close everard simon watched
the struggle fascinated motionless sud-
denly the animal shifted its tactics it
backed away stealthily preparing for an-
other spring the young woodsman
abruptly dropped his knife reached for
the great pistol which depended from his
belt in a rough leather holster there was
a blinding flash and the wolf slithered
down its legs giving under it a great
cloud of acrid smoke drifted about ever-
ard simon cutting off his vision choking
smoke which made him cough

   but through it he saw the look of hor-
rified wonderment on the face of the
young woodsman saw the pistol drop on


weird tales

the damp ground as the knife had
dropped followed with his eyes through
the dimming medium of the hanging
smoke the fascinated round-eyed stare of
the man who had fired the pistol

  there a few feet away from him he
saw an eldritch change passing over the
beast shivering now in its death-struggle
he saw the hair of the great paws dis-
solve the jaws shorten and shrink the
lithe body buckle and heave strangely he
closed his eyes and when he opened them
he saw the figure in deerskins standing
mutely over the body of a man lying
prone across tree-roots a pool of blood
spreading spreading from the concealed
face mingling with the damp earth under
the tree-roots

  then the strange spell of quiescence
which had held him in its weird thrall was
dissolved and moved by a nameless ter-
ror he ran wildly straight down the
narrow path between the trees   

it seemed to him that he had been run-
ning only a short distance when some-
thing the moon above the trees perhaps
began to increase in size to give a more
brilliant light he slackened his pace
the ground now felt firm underfoot no
longer damp slippery other lights
joined that of the moon things became
brighter all about him and as this bril-
liance increased the great trees all about
him turned dim and pale the ground
was now quite hard underfoot he looked
up a brick wall faced him it was pierced
with windows he looked down he
stood on pavement overhead a street-
light swung lightly in the late september
breeze a faint smell of wet leaves was in
the air mingled now with the fresh wind
from the sea the magazine was clutched
tightly in his left hand he had it ap-
peared drawn it from his pocket he
looked at it curiously put it back into the
pocket

  he stepped along over familiar pave-
ment past well-known facades the en-
trance to his fathers apartment loomed
before him mechanically he thrust his
left hand into his trousers pocket he
took out his key opened the door tra-
versed the familiar hallway with its rugs
and marble walls and bracket side-wall
light-clusters he mounted the stairs one
flight turned the comer reached the
door of the apartment let himself in witij
his key

  it was half-past nine and his father had
already retired they talked through the
old mans bedroom door monosyllabical-
ly the conversation ended with the
request from his father that he close the
bedroom door he did so after wishing
the old man good-night

  he sat down in an armchair in the liv-
ing-room passed a hand over his forehead
bemused he sat for fifteen minutes
then he reached into his pocket for a cig-
arette they were all gone then he
remembered that he had meant to buy a
fresh supply on his way to the apartment
he had meant to get the cigarettes from
the drug-store between the church
avenue subway station and the apart-
ment he looked about the room for one
his fathers supply too seemed depleted

  he rose walked into the entry put on
his hat stepped out again into the hall-
way descended the one flight went out
into the street he walked into an un-
wonted atmosphere of excitement people
were conversing as they passed in excited
tones about the drug-store entrance a
crowd was gathered slightly puzzled he
walked toward it paused blocked on the
outer edge

  whats happened he inquired of a
young man whom he found standing just
beside him a little to the fore

  its a shooting of some kind the
young man explained i only just got
no eye-witnesses



here myself the fellow that got bumped
off is inside the drug-store-whats left
of him some gang-war stuff i guess

  he walked away skirting the rounded
edge of the clustering crowd of curiosity-
mongers proceeded dovn the street pro-
cured the cigarettes elsewhere he passed
the now enlarged crowd on the other
side of the street on his way back re-
turned to the apartment where he sat
smoking and thinking until eleven when
he retired curious-a man shot just at
the time or about the time he had let
that imagination of his get the better of
him-those trees

his father awakened him about five
minutes before seven the old man
held a newspaper in his hand he
pointed to a scare-head on the front page

  this must have happened about the
time you came in remarked mr simon

  yes-the crowd was around the drug-
store when i went out to get some cig-
arettes replied everard simon stretch-
ing and yawning

  when his father was gone and he had
finished with his bath he sat down in a
bathrobe to glance over the newspaper
account a phrase arrested him

        the body was identified as that
of jerry the wolf a notorious gangster
with a long prison record then lower
down when he had resumed his reading
 a large-caliber bullet which en-
tering the lower jaw penetrated the base
of the brain  no eye-witnesses   
everard simon sat for a long time after
he had finished the account the news-
paper on the floor by his chair no eye-
witnesses he must really keep that
imagination of his within bounds within
his control

   slowly and reflectively this good res-
olution uppermost he went back to the

bathroom and prepared for his morning
shave

   putting on his shoes in his room he
observed something amiss he picked up
a shoe examined it carefully the soles
of the shoes were caked with black mold
precisely like the mold from the wood-
paths about his adirondack camp little
withered leaves and dried pine-needles
clung to the mold and on the side of
the right shoe were brownish stains exact-
ly like freshly dried bloodstains he
shuddered as he carried the shoes into the
bathroom wiped them clean with a damp
towel then rinsed out the towel he put
them on and shortly afterward before he
entered the subway to go over to the club
for the day he had them polished

   the bootblack spoke of the killing on
that corner the night before the boot-
black noticed nothing amiss with the
shoes and when he had finished there
was no trace of any stains

simon did not change at de kalb
avenue that morning an idea had
occurred to him between church avenue
and de kalb and he stayed on the
brighton local secured a seat after the
emptying process which took place at de
kalb and went on through the east river
tunnel

   he sent in his name to forrest a col-
lege acquaintance now in the district at-
torneys office and forrest received him
after a brief delay

   i wanted to ask a detail about this
gangster who was killed in flatbush last
night said simon i suppose you have
his record havent you

   yes we know pretty well all about
him what particular thing did you want
to know

  about his name replied simon
why was he called jerry the wolf-
that is why the wolf particularly


weird tales

  thats a very queer thing simon such
a name is not really uncommon there
was that fellow goddard you remember
they called him the wolf of wall
street there was the fiction criminal
known as the lone wolf there have
been plenty of wolves among criminal
monikers but this fellow jerry goraff-
sky was a hungarian really he was
called the wolf queerly enough be-
cause there were those in his gang who
believed he was one of those birds who
could change himself into a wolf its a
queer combination isnt it-for a new
york gangster

  yes said everard simon it is very
queer when you come to think of it im
much obliged to you for telling me i
was curious about it somehow

   that isnt the only queer aspect of this
case however resumed forrest a light
frown suddenly showing on his keen face
in fact that wolf-thing isnt a part of the
case-doesnt concern us of course here
in the district attorneys office thats
nothing but blah gangsters are as super-
stitious as sailors more so in fact

  no the real mystery in this affair
is-the bullet simon want to see it

why-yes of course-if you like
forrest whatswrong with the bullet
forrest stepped out of the room re-
turned at once laid a large round ball on

his desk both men bent over it curi-
ously

  notice that diameter simon said
forrest its a hand-molded round ball
-belongs in a collection of curios not in
any gangsters gat why man its like
the slugs they used to hunt the bison be-
fore the old sharps rifle was invented its
the kind of a ball fenimore coopers peo-
ple used-deerslayer it would take a
young cannon to throw that thing
smashed in the whole front of jerrys
ugly mug the inside works of his head
were spilled all over the sidewalk its
what the newspapers always call a clue
who do you suppose resurrected the
horse-pistol-or the ships blunderbuss-
to do that job on jerry clever in a way
hooked it out of some dime museum per-
haps there are still a few of those old
pitches still operating you know at the
old stand-along east fourteenth street

  a flintlock single-shot horse-pistol
id imagine said everard simon laying
the ounce lead ball back on the mahogany
desk he knew something of weapons
new and old as a writer of informa-
tional articles that was part of his per-
manent equipment

  very likely mused the assistant dis-
trict attorney glad you came in old
man

  and everard simon went on uptown to
his club

the old inventor learns the truth about life from his
marvelous radio receiver

the great inventor sank upon his
couch tired and rather depressed
there before him was the last
and greatest child of his brain a radio
receiver many times more sensitive than
any other in the world but after all
what was the use was the struggle
worth while he was an old man worn
out and sick and nearing the end and
when he was gone fools he reflected
would misuse his invention perhaps to
get some ungodly jazz from the far ends
of the earth

  how still was the night not a breath
stirred in the maple trees outside his win-
dow and over them twinkled the stars
countless incredible proofs of a universe
unbounded a universe cruel as death in-
finite heartless inhuman the old man
bowed his white head to shut out the
stars

  suddenly something began to come in
on his marvelous receiver strange he
had tuned the thing so as to bar any or-
dinary wave length all he had wanted
was silence and rest but here it was
faint as a breath but clear enough in the
silence a message in morse

  dear girl

  i hope this will reach you at saturn
i tuned it for saturn knowing that you
must be on your way there ive had a
most interesting trip-where do you sup-
pose ive been why youd never guess
back to that quaint little spot we used to
call the world it was too funny for
words and still rather pathetic my dear

i had forgotten how very primitive it

was

  the voyage down was really lovely
a calm brilliant night with the planets
glowing like fire in -a velvet black sky
as we approached it the dear old world
lit by the full summer sun was a dazzling
mirror of light touched with all the tints
of the spectrum on its curtain of clouds
you know i think that curtain is thinner
than it was when we left as i got into
the mists the radiation of light burst
suddenly into a vast dome of dazzling
blue and the black sky with its millions
of stars was blotted from sight you re-
member the same effect when we came
in to venus

  i couldnt make out where i was at
first but there was a great stretch of land
and i came down at once well my dear
what do you think it proved to be home
that great field we used to call america
-remember-you called it the states
i travelled all over the globe for twenty-
four hours refreshing my memory grace
on the old haunts that we knew do you
remember dirty old london and paris
or italy-my it was lovely-and the
poor little alps it was all so natural
but so small and funny that i could have
laughed and cried good heavens peo-
ple down there are still wearing the same
old bodies that we used to wear do you
remember them dear why they were
heavy as lead two legs think of it we
used to go stalking along on those stilts
its a wonder that we didnt fall and

                                      


weird tales

bones to hold em together great cum-
bersome bones how did we ever stand
it they looked to me like ancient armor
or some ungodly machine

  but then each time we get a new
dress the old one seems funny like that
you must remember how down on venus
we had a good laugh at the queer old
motor suits we had used while on mars
and yet these poor earthworms my dear
hang to their suits like grim death as if
forsooth life would be over when the
machinery broke it is pitiful-and fun-
ny i can dimly remember my horror
down on that stodgy old world when i
found my suit was wearing out oh you
may laugh but it was really a terrible
fear and you must remember yourself
how those old bodies hurt us when any-
thing went wrong they were so heavy
that of course it was a terrible struggle
to get out of them at all how surprized
the earthworms would be if they could
know that today i had just slipped out
of my suit to go up to mars it didnt
take five minutes

  it might occur to the dears that their
suits arent fit for changes they dont
wear the same clothes for alaska and the
tropics and yet they go along in their
noisy airplanes trying to get up to mars
in bodies that aresuited to the world
it is really very stupid i saw some brok-
en bodies on earth poor little huddles of
clothes so very like cast-off overcoats that
one could hardly mistake them how
very blind we were you remember how
we used to put them into boxes and stick
them underground while a parson prayed
before blubbering mourners in solemn
black duds really one might as well
cry and say prayers over his last winters
suit

  but it was sad leaving old friends i
left some on earth that ive never seen
again we know now that in those cases

they didnt really care for us it was
pretty hard to read a persons thought
through all that camouflage great masses
of tallowy flesh skulls and yes even
whiskers do you remember the whis-
kers i laughed aloud when i saw some
on the suit of an earthworm it was a
clumsy suit worn by a man in that flat
field we called russia we used to think
that the russians were primitive we
stalking stiffly around fighting and wor-
rying over our money-poor little greedy
blind fools

  they still use money down there-
isnt it simply absurd of course their
suits are so very hard to keep in condi-
tion that they need a lot of fuel but my
dear most of those earthworms have
money to burn they dont spend half
of it on the upkeep of their bodies you
remember we used to buy savage orna-
ments grace to hang upon our necks
and yet we would worry and scurry over
the face of the world like a swarm of
restless ants searching for something
to do we were blind absolutely
blind  

when the inventors daughter came
in from a dance in the early hours
of the morning she found her father
fast asleep on the couch beside his last
invention on his sunken wrinkled face
was a gentle smile of understanding

  my how peaceful he looks she
thought like a happy child poor dad
he has worked too hard hes not long
for this world i wonder if that receiver
of his is really any good he wont make
much out of it anyway i guess he always
gets cheated well money doesnt mean
such a lot to him he wont need it very
long i hardly dare to wake him he looks
so unearthly but he ought to get to bed
hell be awfully cramped lying all night
in his clothes

archfiends fingers

by kirk mashburn

 john power blundered into a strange and weird adventure during the
 mardi gras carnival in new orleans

what place this was into which he
had stumbled john power neither
knew nor cared it was some
shady cabaret some dimly lighted dive of
sinister shadows perhaps near to the
waterfront

  slumped at a small table he sensed
little of what went on around him re-
membered nothing of how he had become
separated from his friends it was car-
nival time mardi gras day in new
orleans vaguely power knew that he
had celebrated too enthusiastically had
drunk too freely there was a blank in
his memory and everything was rather
more than hazy he had no knowledge
even that the thinning backwash of the
carnival crowds no longer eddied in the
street outside had wearily dissolved in
the early night

  something of his surroundings ob-
scurely troubled the bemused man but
it was too weighty and painful an effort
to think his head throbbed dully nausea
reached slyly touched him with a tenta-
tive finger it seemed that some one
spoke from across the table-

  your pardon sir i have no wish to
intrude but you appear in need of some-
thing to lower your stomach and raise
your spirits

  in blurred indistinct outline power
saw that there was indeed another person
seated opposite him the stranger laughed
dryly as though his indulgence might be
tinged with faintly contemptuous amuse-
ment he beckoned spoke succinctly to

a none too clean waiter who answered
the gesture

  a drink was brought a palely green
drink that shimmered in its glass as if
with flecks of gold in its depths the
stranger pressed the greenish drink upon
the younger man with obdurate if kindly
guised insistence power groaned weakly
swallowed the virescent potion and nau-
sea together know he was shortly to
be ill hoping with teeble malice that he
would be very unpleasantly ill then
perhaps they would let him alone

  the draft stung his palate seared his
throat struck his stomach like flowing
fire amazingly almost before he could
gasp for breath nausea vanished the
throbbing at his temples began to still the
fog to lift from his wits

  ah that is better is it not the
stranger nodded smiled easily power
looked across at him with mixed emo-
tions in which some trace of resentment
lingered

  he took in the dark saturnine coun-
tenance about which there was some-
thing familiar--vaguely and disturbingly
familiar somewhere he thought he had
seen that high forehead the whisper of
memory strove to identify that arrogant
narrow-bridged nose the oddly arched
brows and the thin-lipped mouth that
presently wore a smile of tolerant amuse-
ment

  only the eyes were unfamiliar john
power felt that he had seen the face with-
out having looked into the dark glitter-
ing eyes his memory could not otherwise

have escaped some record of their chill
fascination it was as if he remembered
a picture of the face rather than the liv-
ing countenance

  i feel better power belatedly ac-
knowledged that is-i dont feel ill
nor stupid as i did but-he brushed a
hand uncertainly across his eyes-i dont
know-

  the stranger-he made no move to
identify himself nor strangely did the
thought occur to power-the stranger
laughed again his was an enfolding
laugh a laugh of comprehension it was
as if he knew and understood all the in-
sidious perplexities of mankind-and was
glad of mankinds human frailty

  the waiter broii cx more of the green
drinks the stranger talked to power
while they were coming and the latter
listened they drank often always the
green drinks but power had never felt
more alive his mind had never before
seemed quite so active occasionally the
stranger passed him cigarettes apparently
of tobacco in which the blending gave a
peculiar distinctive taste that was not
however displeasing at the moment

  at length the bracing effect power had
experienced with the first draft of the
green liquor began to wear off his head
was resuming its throbbing and thinking
was again an effort a feeling of uneasi-
ness assailed him with recurring insist-
ence he sensed something disturbing in
his surroundings something that included
his unknown yet oddly familiar table
companion

hf decided to go while the effort was
still possible-wondered that he had
not taken his leave after that revitalizing
first drink with difficulty he gained his
feet hastened by a sudden rising impulse
of dread instinctive insinuating dread
that came unsummoned and unexplained

  surely you will not leave so early

  it was the stranger who spoke but the
simple question seemed to powers tor-
tured fancy fraught with irony and all
the weight of a command giddily he
sought to focus his thoughts thickly he
repeated his intention of departing think-
ing that despite himself he spoke so low
that his words were almost whispered
then he wondered whether instead he
had shouted every one in the place ap-
peared to have centered attention sudden-
ly in his direction

  as power peered about him each face
among those present flared into startling
distinctness-and what faces they were
there were nightmare visages of horror
grotesque distorted faces that worked
with slavering malice as they approached
   god what place was this into
which he had blundered there were
other faces pale with the pallor of death
set masks of wo and utter horrible
despair

  one fantastic shape detached itself and
came forward apart from its fellows it
wore a spanish helmet and breastplate oi
antique design and was shod in high
spanish boots the shadowing helmet
blurred the face beneath and that but in-
tensified an impression of hideous fear-
someness as the monster came beneath
a ceiling light-or was there a light there
was there even a ceiling-power ob-
served that its armor its garments even to
the high boots looked to be splotched and
smeared with red-bloody splotches that
spread and merged until they wholly
enveloped the sinister figure

  who are you power snarled in un-
easy anger there was no answer it was
an easy and natural transition in powers
irrational condition from disturbed peev-
ishness to sudden flaring rage

  still snarling he staggered up seized
his chair and raised it to hurl at the mo-
the archfiend s fingers



tionless figure in ancient spanish armor
but his table companion who had sat
motionless until the moment sprang for-
ward with outstretched hands

  suddenly it seemed to power that he
saw the stranger with blinding clearness
as if a veil had been torn aside-saw him
and knew him for what he was at the
sight of those reaching talons fear
snapped the last shreds of his control he
screamed aloud in panic-

  help and again help

  from a door in the rear of the place
leaped a figure and power shouted with
joy upon recognizing the waiter who had
served his table but no- before his
eyes an awful metamorphosis occurred

   the attendant was but another demon
come to join the grim silently encircling
throng

  away fiends power shrieked again
raising the chair he held before he could
fling it the stranger had seized his wrist
to power it felt as if those taloned fin-
gers seared through his flesh to the bone

  back all of you stand back cried
he of the clutching hands let me deal
with him alone

  the words seared powers brain he
was claimed by the archfiend himself

  the thought gave final impetus to his
madness wrenching violently from the
grasp that pained his wrist and swinging
the chair before him power swept a
path of havoc to a door

  the door opened power gained the
street with a bound fled over ancient
flagstones down dim narrow cobbled
streets what course he covered in
twisted flight he never afterward knew
at the moment he cared only that it was
away from the clamorous pursuit upon
his heels at length looking up the
fugitive recognized an enclosure within a
high iron fence-a fence in which gaped
an open gate

  clanging shut and latching the gate in
the faces of the foremost of the racing
figures at his back power bounded
across jackson square where the hero of
chalmette sat his charger in bronze dis-
dain of the turmoil boiling in his shadow

  the gate stopped pursuit for a precious
moment power made for the opposite
side of the square where saint louis
cathedral loomed out of the shadows
across a narrow street he was spent a
myriad aches racked his heaving chest
but he knew that he must cross that street
gain the cathedral they could never
enter there

  he staggered into the open vestibule
as the chimes pealed on the stroke of mid-
night the period of carnival was over
ash wednesday and lenten penitence
were ushered in while power beat against
the inner doors the patter of pursuing
feet sounded without as their spent quar-
ry sagged and crumpled to the floor

  sanctuary he sobbed sanctuary

  a sound as of rashing waters filled his
ear-drums almost to bursting darkness
crowded in encompassed him the gasp-
ing figure in the cathedral vestibule sank
into merciful oblivion

power recovered his senses in what
seemed a few seconds trip-hammers
pounded inside his head and he was con-
scious of acute and consuming thirst
still dominating every other thought was
the urge to crawl farther into the cathe-
dral

  it had been so much darker a moment
ago he thought with vague wonder as
he strove to drag himself forward some-
thing interfered with his effort he peered
dazedly to see what it was then power
sat up with a jerk that nearly burst his
head filling him with giddiness he
groaned aloud

  he was in a small white bed in a


weird tales

white-walled room with other small
white beds  a hospital ward at his
movement a white-uniformed nurse came
briskly forward

  what happened power croaked
ignoring the nurses injunction to lie
down and be quiet how long have i
been here

  since last night when you were found
collapsed at the doors of saint louis
cathedral the nurse replied her voice
was brittle with disapproval

  why was i brought here power de-
manded gropingly insistent

  because you were suffering from the
effects of acute alcoholism tartly re-
turned the nurse and also-her tone
was definitely accusing-you were rav-
ing as the result of smoking mart juana
mari juana power stupidly repeated

  sisal-hasheesh crisply affirmed the
nurse turning away will you please lie
down

  but power had become aware of a dull
pain that was apart from the bursting of
his head lifting a hand he stared at the
bandage swathing his wrist he would
never be able to forget the stranger who
had shared his table uninvited in a
shadowed unknown place hazily he re-
membered smoking cigarettes of a pecul-
iar acrid taste

  but premonition whispered that drink
nor drug would ever explain the reason
for the gauze wrapped about his wrist
slowly power removed the bandage

  except that they were burned like a
brand into the flesh the marks upon his
wrist were the livid imprint of a thumb
and four long pointed fingers

the story thus far

robert walton captain of a
ship seeking a passage through
 the arctic ocean saw a low car-
riage fixed on a sledge and drawn by
dogs pass over the ice-field to the north
in it sat a being which had the shape of
a man but apparently of gigantic stature

  the next morning after the ice had
broken he rescued from an ice-field an-
other man greatly emaciated only one
of his dogs remained alive for he had
been marooned for some time the man
was victor frankenstein a young scien-
tist who related to captain walton the
incredible story of his life and how he
came to be on the ice-floe

  frankenstein had lived in geneva with
his father and his adopted sister eliza-
beth to whom he was betrothed his
father sent him to school at ingolstadt
with his chum henry clerval there he
progressed in his studies of natural science
to such a point that he learned to create
life

  without taking clerval into his secret
frankenstein created a monster eight feet
tall and human in appearance taking his
materials from graveyards slaughter-

houses and dissecting-rooms the mon-
ster was so terrible to look upon that
frankenstein fled from it and the mon-
ster escaped

  abandoned by its creator the monster
made its way to the vicinity of franken-
steins home where he murdered frank-
ensteins younger brother william mak-
ing it appear that justine moritz a friend
of the family had committed the murder
justine was convicted and sentenced to
death while frankenstein knowing that
if he told the truth he would be con-
sidered a lunatic was forced to keep si-
lence

  frankenstein met the monster in a hut
in the alps and there the monster began
to tell him how he had learned to talk
and how he had changed from a being
with good impulses to a malevolent de-
mon simply because all hands were raised
against him on account of his frightful
appearance

              sleep i thought of the occurrences
              of the day what chiefly struck me was
              the gentle manners of these people and i

longed to join them but dared not i re-
membered too well the treatment i had
suffered the night before from the bar-
barous villagers and resolved whatever
course of conduct i might hereafter think
it right to pursue that for the present i
would remain quietly in my hovel watch-
ing and endeavoring to discover the mo-
tives which influenced their actions

  the cottagers arose the next morning
before the sun the young woman ar-
ranged the cottage and prepared the
food and the youth departed after the
first meal

  this day was passed in the same
routine as that which preceded it the
young man was constantly employed out
of doors and the girl in various laborious
occupations within the old man whom
i soon perceived to be blind employed his
leisure hours on his instrument or in con-
templation nothing could exceed the
love and respect which the younger cot-
tagers exhibited towards their venerable
companion they performed towards
him every little office of affection and duty
with gentleness and he rewarded them by
his benevolent smiles

  they were not entirely happy the
young man and his companion often went
apart and appeared to weep i saw no
cause for their unhappiness but i was
deeply affected by it if such lovely crea-
tures were miserable it was less strange
that i an imperfect and solitary being
should be wretched yet why were these
gentle beings unhappy they possessed a
delightful house for such it was in my
eyes and every luxury they had a fire to
warm them when chill and delicious
viands when hungry they were dressed in
excellent clothes and still more they en-
joyed one anothers company and speech
interchanging each day looks of affection
and kindness what did their tears imply
did they really express pain i was at
first unable to solve these questions

    w t-

   a considerable period elapsed before i
discovered one of the causes of the uneasi-
ness of this amiable family it was pov-
erty and they suffered that evil in a very
distressing degree their nourishment
consisted entirely of the vegetables of
their garden and the milk of one cow
which gave very little during the winter
when its masters could scarcely procure
food to support it they often i believe
suffered the pangs of hunger very poign-
antly especially the two younger cottag-
ers for several times they placed food
before the old man when they reserved
none for themselves

  this trait of kindness moved me sen-
sibly i had been accustomed during the
night to steal a part of their store for my
own consumption but when i found that
in doing this i inflicted pain on the cot-
tagers i abstained and satisfied myself
with berries nuts and roots which i
gathered from a neighboring wood

  i discovered also another means
through which i was enabled to assist their
labors i found that the youth spent a
great part of each day in collecting wood
for the family fire and during the night
i often took his tools the use of which i
quickly discovered and brought home fir-
ing sufficient for the consumption of sev-
eral days

  i remember the first time that i did
this the young woman when she opened
the door in the morning appeared greatly
astonished on seeing a great pile of wood
on the outside she uttered some words in
a loud voice and the youth joined her
who also expressed surprize i observed
with pleasure that he did not go to the
forest that day but spent it in repairing
the cottage and cultivating the garden

    by degrees i made a discovery of still
greater moment i found that these peo-
ple possessed a method of communicating
their experience and feelings to one an-
other by articulate sounds i perceived


weird tales

that the words they spoke sometimes pro-
duced pleasure or pain smiles or sadness
in the minds and countenances of the
hearers this was indeed a god-like sci-
ence and i ardently desired to become
acquainted with it but i was baffled in
every attempt i made for this purpose
their pronunciation was quick and the
words they uttered not having any appar-
ent connection with visible objects i was
unable to discover any clue by which i
could unravel the mystery of their refer-
ence by great application however and
after having remained during the space of
several revolutions of the moon in my
hovel i discovered the names that were
given to some of the most familiar ob-
jects of discourse i learned and applied
the words fire milk bread and wood i
learned also the names of the cottagers
themselves the youth and his companion
had each of them several names but the
old man had only one which was father
the girl was called sister or agatha and
the youth felix brother or son i can not
describe the delight i felt when i learned
the ideas appropriated to each of these
sounds and was able to pronounce them
i distinguished several other words with-
out being able as yet to understand or
apply them such as good dearest un-
happy

t spent the winter in this manner the
jl gentle manners and beauty of the
cottagers greatly endeared them to me
when they were unhappy i felt depressed
when they rejoiced i sympathized in their
joys i saw few human beings besides
them and if any other happened to enter
the cottage their harsh manners and rude
gait only enhanced to me the superior ac-
complishments of my friends

  the old man i could perceive often
endeavored to encourage his children as
sometimes i found that he called them to
cast off their melancholy he would talk

in a cheerful accent with an expression of
goodness that bestowed pleasure even
upon me agatha listened with respect
her eyes sometimes filled with tears
which she endeavored to wipe away un-
perceived but i generally found that her
countenance and tone were more cheerful
after having listened to the exhortations
of her father it was not thus with felix
he was always the saddest of the group
and even to my unpractised senses he ap-
peared to have suffered more deeply than
his friends but if his countenance was
more sorrowful his voice was more cheer-
ful than that of his sister especially when
he addressed the old man

  i could mention innumerable in-
stances which although slight marked
the dispositions of these amiable cottag-
ers in the midst of poverty and want
felix carried with pleasure to his sister the
first little white flower that peeped out
from beneath the snowy ground early
in the morning before she had risen he
cleared away the snow that obstructed her
path to the milk-house drew water from
the well and brought the wood from the
out-house where to his perpetual aston-
ishment he found his store always re-
plenished by an invisible hand in the day
i believe he worked sometimes for a
neighboring farmer because he often
went forth and did not return until din-
ner yet brought no wood with him at
other times he worked in the garden but
as there was little to do in the frosty sea-
son he read to the old man and agatha

  this reading had puzzled me ex-
tremely at first but by degrees i discov-
ered that he uttered many of the same
sounds when he read as when he talked
i conjectured therefore that he found on
the paper signs for speech which he un-
derstood and i ardently longed to com-
prehend these also but how was that pos-
sible when i did not even understand the
sounds for which they stood as signs i

improved however sensibly in this sci-
ence but not sufficiently to follow up any
kind of conversation although i applied
my whole mind to the endeavor for i
easily perceived that although i eagerly
longed to discover myself to the cottagers
i ought not to make the attempt until i
had first become master of their language
which knowledge might enable me to
make them overlook the deformity of my
figure for with this also the contrast
perpetually presented to my eyes had
made me acquainted

   had admired the perfect forms of
my cottagers-their grace beauty and
delicate complexions but how was i ter-
rified when i viewed myself in a transpar-
ent pool at first i started back unable
to believe that it was indeed i who was
reflected in the mirror and when i be-
came fully convinced that i was in reality
the monster that i am i was filled with
the bitterest sensations of despondence
and mortification alas i did not yet en-
tirely know the fatal effects of this miser-
able deformity

  as the sun became warmer and the
light of day longer the snow vanished
and i beheld the bare trees and the black
earth from this time felix was more
employed and the heart-moving indica-
tions of impending famine disappeared

he old man leaning on his son
walked each day at noon when it
did not rain as i found it was called when
the heavens poured forth its waters this
frequently took place but a high wind
quickiy dried the earth and the season be-
came far more pleasant than it had been

  my mode of life in my hovel was uni-
form during the morning i attended
the motions of the cottagers and when
they were dispersed in various occupations
i slept the remainder of the day was
spent in observing my friends when
they had retired to rest if there was any

moon or the night was starlight i went
into the woods and collected my own
food and fuel for the cottage when i
returned as often as it was necessary i
cleared their path from the snow and per-
formed those offices that i had seen done
by felix i afterwards found that these
labors performed by an invisible hand
greatly astonished them and once or twice
i heard them on these occasions utter
the words good spirit wonderful but i
did not then understand the signification
of these terms

  my thoughts now became more active
and i longed to discover the motives and
feelings of these lovely creatures i was
inquisitive to know why felix appeared
so miserable and agatha so sad i
thought foolish wretch that it might
be in my power to restore happiness to
these deserving people when i slept or
was absent the forms of the venerable
blind father the gentle agatha and die
excellent felix flitted before me i looked
upon them as superior beings who would
be the arbiters of my future destiny i
formed in my imagination a thousand pic-
tures of presenting myself to them and
iheir reception of me i imagined that
they would be disgusted until by my
gentle demeanor and conciliating words i
should first win their favor and after-
ward their love

  these thoughts exhilarated me and
led me to apply with fresh ardor to the
acquiring the art of language my organs
were indeed harsh but supple and al-
though my voice was very unlike the soft
music of their tones yet i pronounced
such words as i understood with tolerable
ease

  the pleasant showers and genial
warmth of spring greatly altered the
aspect of the earth men who before this
change seemed to have been hid in caves
dispersed themselves and were employed
in various arts of cultivation the birds

sang in more cheerful notes and the
leaves began to bud forth on the trees
happy happy earth fit habitation for
gods which so short a time before was
bleak damp and unwholesome my
spirits were elevated by the enchanting
appearance of nature the past was blotted
from my memory the present was tran-
quil and the future gilded by bright rays
of hope and anticipations of joy

chapter 

t now hasten to the more moving part
a of my story i shall relate events that
impressed me with feelings which from
what i had been have made me what i
am

  spring advanced rapidly the weather
became fine and the skies cloudless it
surprized me that what before was desert
and gloomy should now bloom with the
most beautiful flowers and verdure my
senses were gratified and refreshed by a
thousand scents of delight and a thou-
sand sights of beauty

  it was on one of these days when my
cottagers periodically rested from labor-
the old man played on his guitar and the
children listened to him-that i observed
the countenance of felix was melancholy
beyond expression he sighed frequently
and once his father paused in his music
and i conjectured by his manner that he
inquired the cause of his sons sorrow
felix replied in a cheerful accent and the
old man was recommencing his music
when some one tapped at the door

  it was a lady on horseback accom-
panied by a countryman as a guide the
lady was dressed in a dark suit and cov-
ered with a thick black veil agatha asked
a question to which the stranger only re-
plied by pronouncing in a sweet accent
the name of felix her voice was mu-
sical but unlike that of either of my
friends on hearing this word felix came

up hastily to the lady who when she saw
him threw up her veil and i beheld a
countenance of angelic beauty and ex-
pression her hair was of a shining raven
black and curiously braided her eyes
were dark but gentle although animated
her features of a regular proportion and
her complexion wondrously fair each
cheek tinged with a lovely pink

  felix seemed ravished with delight
when he saw her every trait of sorrow
vanished from his face and it instantly
expressed a degree of ecstatic joy of
which i could hardly have believed it
capable his eyes sparkled as his cheek
flushed with pleasure and at that moment
i thought him as beautiful as the stranger
she appeared affected by different feel-
ings wiping a few tears from her lovely
eyes she held out her hand to felix who
kissed it rapturously and called her as
well as i could distinguish his sweet
arabian she did not appear to under-
stand him but smiled

  he assisted her to dismount and dis-
missing her guide conducted her into the
cottage some conversation took place be-
tween him and his father and the young
stranger knelt at the old mans feet and
would have kissed his hand but he raised
her and embraced her affectionately

  i soon perceived that although the
stranger uttered articulate sounds and ap-
peared to have a language of her own
she was neither understood by nor her-
self understood the cottagers they made
many signs which i did not comprehend
but i saw that her presence diffused glad-
ness through the cottage dispelling their
sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning
mists felix seemed peculiarly happy and
with smiles of delight welcomed his
arabian agatha the ever-gentle agatha
kissed the hands of the lovely stranger
and pointing to her brother made signs
which appeared to me to mean that he had
been sorrowful until she came
frankenstein



  some hours passed thus while they
by their countenances expressed joy the
cause of which i did not comprehend
presently i found by the frequent recur-
rence of some sound which the stranger
repeated after them that she was endeav-
oring to learn their language and the idea
instantly occurred to me that i should
make use of the same instructions to the
same end the stranger learned about
twenty words at the first lesson most of
them indeed were those which i had be-
fore understood but i profited by the
others

  as night came on agatha and the
arabian retired early when they sepa-
rated felix kissed the hand of the
stranger and said good night sweet
safie he sat up much longer conversing
with his father and by the frequent repe-
tition of her name i conjectured that
their lovely guest was the subject of their
conversation i ardently desired to under-
stand them and bent every faculty to-
wards that purpose but found it utterly
impossible

  the next morning felix went out to
his work and after the usual occupations
of agatha were finished the arabian sat
at the feet of the old man and taking his
guitar played some airs so entrancingly
beautiful that they at once drew tears of
sorrow and delight from my eyes she
sang and her voice flowed in a rich ca-
dence swelling or dying away like a
nightingale of the woods

  when she had finished she gave the
guitar to agatha who at first declined it
she played a simple air and her voice ac-
companied it in sweet accents but unlike
the wondrous strain of the stranger the
old man appeared enraptured and said
some words which agatha endeavored to
explain to safie and by which he ap-
peared to wish to express that she be-
stowed on him the greatest delight by her
music

he days now passed as peaceably as
before with the sole alteration that
joy had taken place of sadness in the
countenances of my friends safie was al-
ways gay and happy she and i improved
rapidly in the knowledge of language so
that in two months i began to compre-
hend most of the words uttered by my
protectors

  in the meanwhile also the black
ground was covered with herbage and
the green banks interspersed with innum-
erable flowers sweet to the scent and the
eyes stars of pale radiance among the
moonlight woods the sun became warm-
er the nights clear and balmy and my
nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleas-
ure to me although they were considera-
bly shortened by the late setting and early
rising of the sun for i never ventured
abroad during daylight fearful of meet-
ing with the same treatment i had for-
merly endured in the first village which i
entered

  my days were spent in close atten-
tion that i might more speedily master
the language and i may boast that i im-
proved more rapidly than the arabian
who understood very little and conversed
in broken accents whilst i comprehended
and could imitate almost every word that
was spoken

  while i improved in speech i also
learned the science of letters as it was
taught to the stranger and this opened
before me a wide field for wonder and
delight

  the book from which felix instructed
safie was volneys ruins of empires i
should not have understood the purport
of this book had not felix in reading it
given very minute explanations he had
chosen this work he said because the
declamatory style was framed in imitation
of the eastern authors through this work
i obtained a cursory knowledge of history
and a view of the several empires at pres-


weird tales

ent existing in the world it gave me an
insight into the manners governments
and religions of the different nations of
die earth i heard of the slothful asiatics
of the stupendous genius and mental ac-
tivity of the grecians of the wars and
wonderful virtue of the early romans-
of their subsequent degenerating-of the
decline of that mighty empire of chivalry
christianity and kings i heard of the
discovery of the american hemisphere
and wept with safie over the hapless fate
of its original inhabitants

  these wonderful narrations inspired
me with strange feelings was man in-
deed at once so powerful so virtuous and
magnificent yet so vicious and base he
appeared at one time a mere scion of the
evil principle and at another as all that
can be conceived of noble and god-like
to be a great and virtuous man appeared
the highest honor that can befall a sensi-
tive being to be base and vicious as many
on record have been appeared the lowest
degradation a condition more abjcct than
that of the blind mole or harmless worm
for a long time i could not conceive how
one man could go forth to murder his fel-
low or even why there were laws and
governments but when i heard details of
vice and bloodshed my wonder ceased
and i turned away with disgust and loath-
ing

  every conversation of the cottagers
now opened new wonders to me while i
listened to the instructions which felix
bestowed upon the arabian the strange
system of human society was explained to
me i heard of the division of property
of immense wealth and squalid poverty
of rank descent and noble blood

  the words induced me to turn to-
wards myself i learned that the posses-
sions most esteemed by your fellow-
creatures were high and unsullied descent
united with riches a man might be re-

spected with only one of these advantages
but without either he was considered
except in very rare instances as a vaga-
bond and a slave doomed to waste his
powers for the profits of the chosen few
and what was i of my creation and
creator i was absolutely ignorant but i
knew that i possessed no money no
friends no kind of property i was be-
sides endued with a figure hideously de-
formed and loathsome i was not even of
the same nature as man i was more agile
than they and could subsist upon coarser
diet i bore the extremes of heat and cold
with less injury to my frame my stature
far exceeded theirs when i looked
around i saw and heard of none like me
was i then a monster a blot upon the
earth from which all men fled and whom
all men disowned

t can not describe to you the agony
a that these reflections inflicted upon
me i tried to dispel them but sorrow
only increased with knowledge oh that
i had for ever remained in my native
wood nor known nor felt beyond the sen-
sations of hunger thirst and heat

  of what a strange nature is knowl-
edge it clings to the mind when it has
once seized on it like a lichen on the rock
i wished sometimes to shake off all
thought and feeling but i learned that
there was but one means to overcome the
sensation of pain and that was death-a
state which i feared yet did not under-
stand i admired virtue and good feel-
ings and loved the gentle manners and
amiable qualities of my cottagers but i
was shut out from intercourse with them
except through means which i obtained
by stealth when i was unseen and
unknown and which rather increased
than satisfied the desire i had of becom-
ing one among my fellows the gentle
words of agatha and the animated smiles
frankenstein



of the charming arabian were not for
me the mild exhortations of the old
man and the lively conversation of the
loved felix were not for me miserable
unhappy wretch

  other lessons were impressed upon
me even more deeply i heard of the dif-
ference of sexes and the birth and
growth of children how the father doted
on the smiles of the infant and the lively
sallies of the older child how all the life
and cares of the mother were wrapped up
in the precious charge how the mind of
youth expanded and gained knowledge
of brother sister and all the various re-
lationships which bind one human being
to another in mutual bonds

  but where were my friends and rela-
tions no father had watched my infant
days no mother had blessed me with
smiles and caresses or if they had all my
past life was now a blot a blind vacancy
in which i distinguished nothing from
my earliest remembrance i had been as i
then was in height and proportion i had
never yet seen a being resembling me or
who claimed any intercourse with me
what was i

  i will soon explain to what these feel-
ings tended but allow me now to return
to the cottagers whose story excited in me
such various feelings of indignation de-
light and wonder but which all termi-
nated in additional love and reverence for
my protectors for so i loved in an inno-
cent half-painful self-deceit to call
them

chapter 

tome time elapsed before i learned
the history of my friends it was one
which could not fail to impress itself
deeply on my mind unfolding as it did
a number of circumstances each interest-
ing and wonderful to one so utterly inex-
perienced as i was

  the name of the old man was de
lacey he was descended from a good
family in france where he had lived for
many years in affluence respected by his
superiors and beloved by his equals his
son was bred in the service of his country
and agatha had ranked with ladies of the
highest distinction a few months before
my arrival they had lived in a large and
luxurious city called paris surrounded by
friends and possessed of every enjoyment
which virtue refinement of intellect or
taste accompanied by a moderate fortune
could afford

  the father of safie had been the cause
of their ruin he was a turkish merchant
and had inhabited paris for many years
when for some reason which i could not
learn he became obnoxious to the govern-
ment he was seized and cast into prison
the very day that safie arrived from con-
stantinople to join him he was tried and
condemned to death the injustice of his
sentence was very flagrant all paris was
indignant and it was judged that his re-
ligion and wealth rather than the crime
alleged against him had been the cause
of his condemnation

  felix had accidentally been present at
the trial his horror and indignation were
uncontrollable when he heard the decision
of the court he made at that moment a
solemn vow to deliver him and then
looked around for the means after many
fruitless attempts to gain admittance to
the prison he found a strongly grated
window in an unguarded part of the
building which lighted the dungeon of
the unfortunate mahometan who loaded
with chains waited in despair the execu-
tion of the barbarous sentence

  felix visited the grate at night and
made known to the prisoner his intentions
in his favor the turk amazed and de-
lighted endeavored to kindle the zeal of
his deliverer by promises of reward and
wealth felix rejected his offers with con-


weird tales

tempt yet when he saw the lovely safie
who was allowed to visit her father and
who by her gestures expressed her lively
gratitude the youth could not help own-
ing to his own mind that the captive pos-
sessed a treasure which would fully re-
ward his toil and hazard

  the turk quickly perceived the im-
pression that his daughter had made on
the heart of felix and endeavored to se-
cure him more entirely in his interests by
the promise of her hand in marriage so
soon as he should be conveyed to a place
of safety felix was too delicate to ac-
cept this offer yet he looked forward to
the probability of the event as to the con-
summation of his happiness

  during the ensuing days while the
preparations were going forward for the
escape of the merchant the zeal of felix
was warmed by several letters that he re-
ceived from this lovely girl who found
means to express her thoughts in the
language of her lover by the aid of an old
man a servant of her father who under-
stood french she thanked him in the
most ardent terms for his intended serv-
ices towards her parent and at the same
time she gently deplored her own fate

  safie related that her mother was a
christian arab seized and made a slave
by the turks tecomraended by her
beauty she had won the heart of the
father of safie who married her the
young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic
terms of her mother who born in free-
dom spurned the bondage to which she
was now reduced she instructed her
daughter in the tenets of her religion and
taught her to aspire to higher powers of
intellect and an independence of spirit
forbidden to the female followers of ma-
homet

  this lady died but her lessons were
indelibly impressed on the mind of safie
who sickened at the prospect of again re-
turning to asia and being immured with-

in the walls of a harm allowed only to
occupy herself with infantile amusements
ill suited to the temper of her soul now
accustomed to grand ideas and a noble
emulation for virtue the prospect of
marrying a christian and remaining in a
country where women were allowed to
take a rank in society was enchanting to
her

   the day for the execution of the turk
was fixed but on the night previous to
it he quitted his prison and before morn-
ing was distant many leagues from paris
felix had procured passports in the name
of his father sister and himself he had
previously communicated his plan to the
former who aided the deceit by quitting
his house under the pretense of a jour-
ney and concealed himself with his
daughter in an obscure part of paris

t elix conducted the fugitives through
france to lyons and across mont
cenis to leghorn where the merchant
had decided to wait a favorable oppor-
tunity of passing into some part of the
turkish dominions

  safie resolved to remain with her
father until the moment of his departure
before which time hie tutk renewed his
promise that she should be united to his
deliverer and felix remained with them
in expectation of that event and in the
meantime he enjoyed the society of the
arabian who exhibited towards him the
simplest and tenderest affection they
conversed with one another through the
means of an interpreter and sometimes
with the interpretation of looks and safie
sang to him the divine airs of her native
country

  the turk allowed this intimacy to
take place and encouraged the hopes of
the youthful lovers while in his heart he
had formed far other plans he loathed
the idea that his daughter should be
frankenstein



united to a christian but he feared the
resentment of felix if he should appear
lukewarm for he knew that he was still
in the power of his deliverer if he should
choose to betray him to the italian state
which they inhabited he revolved a thou-
sand plans by which he should be enabled
to prolong the deceit until it might be no
longer necessary and secretly to take his
daughter with him when he departed his
plans were facilitated by the news which
arrived from paris

  the government of france were
greatly enraged at the escape of their vic-
tim and spared no pains to detect and
punish his deliverer the plot of felix
was quickly discovered and de lacey and
agatha were thrown into prison the
news reached felix and roused him from
his dream of pleasure his blind and
aged father and his gentle sister lay in a
noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the
free air and the society of her whom he
loved this idea was torture to him he
quickly arranged with the turks that if
the latter should find a favorable oppor-
tunity for escape before felix could re-
turn to italy safie should remain as a
boarder at a convent at leghorn and then
quitting the lovely arabian he hastened
to paris and delivered himself up to the
vengeance of the law hoping to free de
lacey and agatha by this proceeding

  he did not succeed they remained
confined for five months before the trial
took place the result of which deprived
them of their fortune and condemned
them to a perpetual exile from their na-
tive country

  they found a miserable asylum in the
cottage in germany where i discovered
them felix soon learned that the treach-
erous turk for whom he and his family
endured such unheard-of oppression on
discovering that his deliverer was thus re-
duced to poverty and ruin became a trai-
tor to good feeling and honor and had

quitted italy with his daughter insult-
ingly sending felix a pittance of money
to aid him as he said in some plan of
future maintenance

  such were the events that preyed qn
the heart of felix and rendered him
when i first saw him the most miserable
of his family he could have endured
poverty and while this distress had been
the meed of his virtue he gloried in it
but the ingratitude of the turk and the
loss of his beloved safie were misfortunes
more bitter and irreparable the arrival
of the arabian now infused new life into
his soul

  when the news reached leghorn that
felix was deprived of his wealth and rank
the merchant commanded his daughter to
think no more of her lover but to prepare
to return to her native country the gen-
erous nature of safie was outraged by this
command she attempted to expostulate
with her father but he left her angrily
reiterating his tyrannical mandate

  a few days after the turk entered his
daughters apartment and told her hastily
that he had reason to believe that his resi-
dence at leghorn had been divulged and
that he should speedily be delivered up to
the french government he had conse-
quently hired a vessel to convey him to
constantinople for which city he should
sail in a few hours he intended to leave
his daughter under the care of a confiden-
tial servant to follow at her leisure with
the greater part of his property which
had not yet arrived at leghorn

  when alone safie resolved in her own
mind the plan of conduct that it would
become her to pursue in this emergency
a residence in turkey was abhorrent to
her her religion and her feelings were
alike adverse to it by some papers of her
father which fell into her hands she
heard of the exile of her lover and learnt
the name of the spot where he then re
sided she hesitated some time but at


weird tales

length she formed her determination
taking with her some jewels that be-
longed to her and a sum of money she
quitted italy with an attendant a native
of leghorn but who understood the com-
mon language of turkey and departed
for germany

  she arrived in safety at a town about
twenty leagues from the cottage of de
lacey when her attendant fell danger-
ously ill safie nursed her with the most
devoted affection but the poor girl died
and the arabian was left alone unac-
quainted with the language of the coun-
try and utterly ignorant of the customs of
the world she fell however into good
hands the italian had mentioned the
name of the spot for which they were
bound and after her death the woman
of the house in which they had lived took
care that safie should arrive in safety at
the cottage of her lover

chapter 

ouch was the history of my beloved
 cottagers it impressed me deeply i
learned from the views of social life
which it developed to admire their vir-
tues and to deprecate the vices of man-
kind

  as yet i looked upon crime as a dis-
tant evil benevolence and generosity were
ever present before me inciting within me
a desire to become an actor in the busy
scene where so many admirable qualities
were called forth and displayed but in
giving an account of the progress of my
intellect i must not omit a circumstance
which occurred in the beginning of the
month of august of the same year

  one night during my accustomed
visit to the neighboring wood where i
collected my own food and brought home
firing for my protectors i found on the
ground a leathern portmanteau contain-
ing several articles of dress and some

books i eagerly seized the prize and re-
turned with it to my hovel fortunately
the books were written in the language
the elements of which i had acquired at
the cottage they consisted of paradise
lost a volume of plutarchs lives and
the sorrows of werther the possession
of these treasures gave me extreme de-
light i now continually studied and ex-
ercised my mind upon these histories
whilst my friends were employed in their
ordinary occupations

   i can hardly describe to you the effect
of these books they produced in me an
infinity of new images and feelings that
sometimes raised me to ecstasy but more
frequently sunk me into the lowest de-
jection in the sorrows of werther be-
sides the interest of its simple and affect-
ing story so many opinions are canvassed
and so many lights thrown upon what
had hitherto been to me obscure subjects
that i found in it a never-ending source of
speculation and astonishment the gentle
and domestic manners it described com-
bined with lofty sentiments and feelings
which had for their object something out
of self accorded well with my experience
among my protectors and with the wants
which were for ever alive in my own
bosom but i thought werther himself a
more divine being than i had ever beheld
or imagined his character contained no
pretension but it sunk deep the dis-
quisitions upon death and suicide were
calculated to fill me with wonder

  as i read however i applied much
personally to my own feelings and con-
dition i found myself similar yet at the
same time strangely unlike to the beings
concerning whom i read and to whose
conversation i was a listener i sympa-
thized with and partly understood them
but i was unformed in mind i was de-
pendent on none and related to none
the path of my departure was free and
there was none to lament my annihilation
frankenstein



my person was hideous and my stature
gigantic what did this mean who
was i what was i whence did i come
what was my destination these ques-
tions continually recurred but i was un-
able to solve them

  the volume of plutarchs lives which
i possessed contained the histories of the
first founders of the ancient republics
this book had a far different effect upon
me from the sorrows of werther i
learned from werthers imaginations
despondency and gloom but plutarch
taught me high thoughts he elevated me
above the wretched sphere of my own re-
flections to admire and love the heroes of
past ages

  many things i read surpassed my un-
derstanding and experience i had a very
confused knowledge of kingdoms wide
extents of country mighty rivers and
boundless seas but i was perfectly unac-
quainted with towns and large assem-
blages of men the cottage of my pro-
tectors had been the only school in which
i had studied human nature but this book
developed new and mightier scenes of
action i read of men concerned in public
affairs governing or massacring their
species i felt the greatest ardor for vir-
tue rise within me and abhorrence for
vice as far as i understood the significa-
tion of those terms relative as they were
as i applied them to pleasure and pain
alone induced by these feelings i was
of course led to admire peaceable law-
givers numa solon and lycurgus in
preference to romulus and theseus the
patriarchal lives of my protectors caused
these impressions to take a firm hold on
my mind perhaps if my first introduction
to humanity had been made by a young
soldier burning for glory and slaughter
i should have been imbued with different
sensations

  but paradise lost excited different
and far deeper emotions i read it as i

had read the other volumes which had
fallen into my hands as a true history it
moved every feeling of wonder and awe
that the picture of an omnipotent god
warring with his creatures was capable of
exciting i often referred the several situ-
ations as their similarity struck me to my
own like adam i was apparently united
by no link to any other being in existence
but his state was far different from mine
in every other respect he had come forth
from the hands of god a perfect creature
happy and prosperous guarded by the
especial care of his creator he was al-
lowed to converse with and acquire
knowledge from beings of a superior na-
ture but i was wretched helpless and
alone

  another circumstance strengthened
and confirmed these feelings soon after
my arrival in the hovel i discovered some
papers in the pocket of the dress which i
had taken from your laboratory at first
i had neglected them but now that i was
able to decipher the characters in which
they were written i began to study them
with diligence it was your journal of the
four months that preceded my creation
you minutely described in these papers
every step you took in the progress of your
work this history was mingled with ac-
counts of domestic occurrences you
doubtless recollect these papers here
they are everything is related in them
which bears reference to my accursed
origin the whole detail of that series of
disgusting circumstances which produced
it is set in view the minutest descrip-
tion of my odious and loathsome per-
son is given in language which painted
your own horrors and rendered mine in-
delible

  i sickened as i read hateful day
when i received life i exclaimed in
agony accursed creator why did you
form a monster so hideous that even you
turned from me in disgust god in pity


weird tales

made man beautiful and alluring after
his own image but my form is a filthy
type of yours more horrid even from the
very resemblance satan had his compan-
ions fellow-devils to admire and encour-
age him but i am solitary and abhorred

mp hese were the reflections of my

  a hours of despondency and solitude
but when i contemplated the virtues of
the cottagers their amiable and benevo-
lent dispositions i persuaded myself that
when they should become acquainted with
my admiration of their virtues they
would compassionate me and overlook
my personal deformity could they turn
from their door one however monstrous
who solicited their compassion and
friendship i resolved at least not to
despair but in every way to fit myself for
an interview with them which would de-
cide my fate

  i postponed this attempt for some
months longer for the importance at-
tached to its success inspired me with a
dread lest i should fail besides i found
that my understanding improved so much
with every days experience that i was un-
willing to commence this undertaking
until a few more months should have
added to my sagacity

  several changes in the meantime
took place in the cottage the presence
of safie diffused happiness among its in-
habitants and i also found that a greater
degree of plenty reigned there felix and
agatha spent more time in amusement
and conversation and were assisted in
their labors by servants they did not ap-
pear rich but they were contented and
happy their feelings were serene and
peaceful while mine became every day
more tumultuous increase of knowledge
only discovered to me more clearly what a
wretched outcast i was i cherished hope
it is true but it vanished when i beheld
my person reflected in water

  i endeavored to crush these fears and
to fortify myself for the trial which in a
few months i resolved to undergo and
sometimes i allowed my thoughts un-
checked by reason to ramble in the fields
of paradise and dared to fancy amiable
and lovely creatures sympathizing with
my feelings and cheering my gloom their
angelic countenances breathed smiles of
consolation but it was all a dream no
eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my
thoughts i was alone i remembered
adams supplication to his creator but
where was mine he had abandoned me
and in the bitterness of my heart i cursed
him

  autumn passed thus i saw with
surprize and grief the leaves decay and
fall and nature again assume the barren
and bleak appearance it had worn when i
first beheld the woods and the lovely
moon yet i did not heed the bleakness
of the weather i was better fitted by my
conformation for the endurance of cold
than heat but my chief delights were the
sight of the flowers the birds and all the
gay apparel of summer when those de-
serted me i turned with more attention
towards the cottagers their happiness
was not decreased by the absence of sum-
mer they loved and sympathized with
one another and their joys depending on
each other were not interrupted by the
casualties that took place around them
the more i saw of them the greater be-
came my desire to claim their protection
and kindness my heart yearned to be
known and loved by these amiable crea-
tures to see their sweet looks directed
towards me with affection was the utmost
limit of my ambition i dared not think
that they would turn them from me with
disdain and horror the poor that stopped
at their door were never driven away

  the winter advanced and an entire
revolution of the seasons had taken place

  coming next month

s sardanapalus king of babylon had feasted with his magi and women
and favorites and all the sycophants of a fabulously wealthy court so did prince
dena ibn zodh in his black and scarlet robes of ceremony sit with evadne at
his side on the night of sacrifice

   wild beasts controlled by the magnetic power of the magi rolled in luxurious ease
on silken rugs the great tables gleamed with jewelled goblets and golden dishes a
thousand instruments mingled with the clamor of a thousand tongues waves of intoxi-
cating perfumes were wafted up from vaults beneath the palace myriads of lamps
winked and blazed from roof and walls and pillars at intervals a dancer would float
out on to the great white marble circle of floor round which the tables were grouped
veiled only in her cloud of hair and moving like a blown leaf before the wind would
draw an outburst of applause that set the great beasts roaring until the domed hall rang

   vast sinister marvellous as the dreams of a hashish-eater the long orgy at last drew
to an end the revellers lay back amidst their cushions while prince dena rose from
his place and led evadne to the center of the enclosed circle

   he held up a hand and silence fell over the entire multitude of feasters not even a
beast but seemed suddenly turned to a lifeless statue sir hugh willett and hadur
who had sat watchful and silent during the long revel looked up with tightening nerves
as the destined bride stood facing the vast assembly

   a single garment of marvellously wrought gold tissue outlined her lovely slender-
ness her shining head was bound with a richly jewelled circlet of gold and over her
eyes its clasp glittered bright and evil in the myriads of lamps so brilliant were the
gems that formed this clasp that it had all the effect of a living flame and sir hugh
shuddered as he saw the hatefully familiar symbol of melek taos flash and flash again
about evadnes dreaming misted eyes

   the hour is at hand the high priests ringing tones pierced even the wine-sod-
den senses of the revellers this is my hour my hour of love my hour of fulfilment
the hour of mystic communion with melek taos when he in me and i in him re-

since i awoke into life my attention at
this time was solely directed towards my
plan of introducing myself into the cot-
tage of my protectors i revolved many
projects but that on which i finally fixed
was to enter the dwelling when the blind
old man should be alone i had sagacity
enough to discover that the uanatural
hideousness of my person was the chief
object of horror with those who had for-
merly beheld me my voice although
harsh had nothing terrible in it i
thought therefore that if in the absence
of his children i could gain the good-will
and mediation of the old de lacey i
might by this means be tolerated by my
younger protectors

  one day when the sun shone on the
red leaves that strewed the ground and
diffused cheerfulness although it denied
warma safie agatha and felix departed
on a long country walk and the old man
at his own desire was left alone in die
cottage when his children had departed
he took up his guitar and played several
mournful but sweet airs more sweet and
mournful than i had ever heard him play
before at first his countenance was illu-
minated with pleasure but as he con-
tinued thoughtfulness and sadness suc-
ceeded at length laying aside the instru-
ment he sat absorbed in reflection

  my heart beat quick this was the hour
and moment of trial which would decide
my hopes or realize my fears the ser-
vants were gone to a neighboring fair
all was silent in and around the cottage
it was an excellent opportunity yet when
i proceeded to execute my plan my limbs
failed me and i sank to the ground
again i rose and exerting all the firm-
ness of which i was master removed the
planks which i had placed before my hovel
to gooceal my retreat the fresh air re-
vived me and with renewed determina-

tion i approached the door of their cot-
tage

  i knocked who is there said the
old man-come in

  i entered pardon this intrusion said
i i am a traveller in want of a little rest
you would greatly oblige me if you would
allow me to remain a few minutes before
the fire

   enter said de lacey and i will try
in what manner i can relieve your wants
but unfortunately my children are from
home and as i am blind i am afraid i
shall find it difficult to procure food for
you

   do not trouble yourself my kind
host i have food it is warmth and rest
only that i need

t sat down and a silence ensued i
-i knew that every minute was precious
to me yet i remained irresolute in what
manner to commence the interview when

the old man addressed me-

   by your language stranger i sup-
pose you are my countryman-are you
french

   no but i was educated by a french
family and understand that language
only i am now going to claim the pro-
tection of some friends whom i sincerely
love and cf whose favor i have some
hopes

   are they germans

   no they are french but let us
change the subject i am an unfortunate
and deserted creature i look around and
i have no relation or friend upon earth
these amiable people to whom i go have
never seen me and know little of me i
am full of fears for if i fail there i am
an outcast in the world for ever

   do not despair to be friendless is
indeed to be unfortunate but the hearts of
men when unprejudiced by any obvious
self-interest are full of brotherly love and
charity rely therefore on your hopes

and if these friends are good and amiable
do not despair

   they are kind-they are the most ex-
cellent creatures in the world but unfor-
tunately they are prejudiced against me
i have good dispositions my life has been
hitherto harmless and in some degree
beneficial but a fatal prejudice clouds
their eyes and where they ought to see a
feeling and kind friend they behold only
a detestable monster

   that is indeed unfortunate but if
you are really blameless can not you un-
deceive them

   i am about to undertake that task
and it is on that account that i feel so
many overwhelming terrors i tenderly
love these friends i have unknown to
them been for many months in the habits
of daily kindness towards them but they
believe that i wish to injure them and it
is that prejudice which i wish to over-
come

   where do these friends reside

    near this spot

  the old man paused and then con-
tinued if you will unreservedly confide
to me the particulars of your tale i per-
haps may be of use in undeceiving them
i am blind and can not judge of your
countenance but there is something in
your words which persuades me that you
are sincere i am poor and an exile but
it will afford me true pleasure to be in any
way serviceable to a human creature

   excellent man i thank you and
accept your generous offer you raise me
from the dust by this kindness and i trust
that by your aid i shall not be driven
from the society and sympathy of your
fellow-creatures

   heaven forbid even if you were
really criminal for that can only drive you
to desperation and not instigate you to
virtue i also am unfortunate i and my
family have been condemned although

innocent judge therefore if i do not feel
for your misfortunes

   how can i thank you my best and
only benefactor from your lips first
have i heard the voice of kindness directed
towards me i shall be for ever grateful
and your present humanity assures me of
success with those friends whom i am on
the point of meeting

   may i know the names and residence
of those friends

  i paused this i thought was the
moment of decision which was to rob me
of or bestow happiness on me for ever
i struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to
answer him but the effort destroyed all
my remaining strength i sank on the
chair and sobbed aloud at that moment i
heard the steps of my younger protectors

i	had not a moment to lose but seizing
the hand of the old man i cried now is
the time-save and protect me you and
your family are the friends whom i seek
do not you desert me in the hour of trial
 great god exclaimed the old man
who are you

  at that instant the cottage door was
opened and felix safie and agatha en-
tered who can describe their horror and
consternation on beholding me agatha
fainted and safie unable to attend to her
friend rushed out of the cottage felix
darted forward and with supernatural
force tore me from his father to whose
knees i clung in a transport of fury he
dashed me to the ground and struck me
violently with a stick i could have trn
him limb from limb as die lion rends the
antelope but my heart sunk within me
as with bitter sickness and i refrained i
saw him on the point of repeating his
blow when overcome by pain and an-
guish i quitted the cottage and in the
general tumult escaped unperceived to my
hovel
