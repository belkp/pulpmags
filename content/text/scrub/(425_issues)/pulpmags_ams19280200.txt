oymvro amazing stories write today for big aiew catalog telling you how coyne electrical school not a correspondence school h c lewis president dept - -established south paulina street chicago now ive worked on a farm didnt do me no harm
  but i never could save up a dime

   i slaved like a horse just using brute force

   for pleasures i never had time

   it was early to bed when the stock was all fed

   then youd get up at cold of the dawn

   not once did i shirk in the rounds of my work
   but one day my pep was all gone

  so i moved into town and i clerked all around
  but the little i made was soon spent

  yet i kept at it for there was nothing much more
  i could do that would pay me a cent

   i worked as a clerk and i worked like a turk

   but i couldnt get nowheres at all

  three years passed on by-my expenses were high-

   so i shifted my job in the fall

   yes i hired out one day for a little more pay
   at some laboring work on a road

   i would sweat in the sun if it rained-got no mon

   and dig dig was all that i knowed

  the gang boss would come and bully me dumb

   he bossed us around like a brute

   well i stood it a year till one day i went queer

   and busted him one on his snoot

   that finished me there so with pocket still bare

   i worked in an auto garage

   i tinkered away at about the same pay

   a-giving them cars a massage

  no i didnt know beans about them there machines
  and it took me just three years to learn

  and even by then i was scarce of iron men
  so my hands to a new job id turn

   this time i got stuck on a job with a truck-

   for driving took almost no brains

  the wages was fair-but no money to spare-

   so i left it to work on the trains

   then i drifted from there to a factory whero
   i piddled around for a spell

   i tried out my hand at all jobs in the land

  and now that ive done it-aw h-

   a mans got to train-got to train his old brain
   in one trade and follow it thru

   ive tried every one-and while it was fun

   im busted-and you will be too

  yes you will be broke-not a cent in your poke-

   unless you get trained for a trade

   get trained by the best then youll pass all the rest
   and roost where the big dough is made

   why theres thousands like me just as broke as can be
   who do all the work-for small pay

   its so easy to drift-take a job--make a shift-

   but youll never get nowheres that way

   i wish id the job that keeps busy friend bob

   my pal of the days long ago

   hes making his pile and hes living in style

  i had the same chance-that i know

  but bob took his chance when we happened to glance
  at a coyne school electrical ad

   he said that sure looks good gee whiz if i could
   id go there and be mighty glad

  well i laughed and i said that there ad you just read
  is the bunk-but he wouldnt agree-

   he wrote to the man and he sized up his plan
   and he said thats the training for me

  bob was busted and so things moved along slow
  he wanted to go but was flat

  so he borrowed and went-finished-paid what wa lent
  and now look where bobby is atl
  hes got his own shop-while me im a flop

   i never was trained-thats just why

   so take it from me learn a trade and youll be
   a-sittin on top of the skyl

   note this rhymo was sent in to me by a man who had finally
   come to his senses and realized that an un-trained man hasnt a

amazing stories



  many times in the old days
while i trudged home after
work to save carjare i used
to gaze enviously at the shin-
ing cars gliding by me the
prosperous men and women
within little did i think that
inside oj a year i too
should have my own car a
decent batik account the
good things oj life that make
it worth li ing

i thought success was for others

      believe it or not just twelve months ago
      i was next thing to down-and-out

today im sole owner of the fastest
growing radio store in town and im
on good terms with my banker too-not
like the old days only a year ago when
often i didnt have one dollar to knock
against another in my pocket my wife
and i live in the snuggest little home you
ever saw right in one of the best neighbor-
hoods and to think that a year ago i used
to dodge the landlady when she came to
collect the rent for the little bedroom i
called home

  it all seems like a dream now as i look
back over the past twelve short months and
think how discouraged i was then at the
end of a blind alley i thought i never
had had a good chance in my life and i
thought i never would have one but it
was waking up that i needed and heres
the story of how i got it

was a clerk working at the usual mis-
erable salary such jobs pay somehow
id never found any way to get into a line
where i could make good money

  other fellows seemed to find opportuni-
ties but-much as i wanted the good
things that go with success and a decent
income-all the really well-paid vacancies
i ever heard of seemed to be out of my line
-to call for some kind of knowledge i
didnt have

  and i wanted to get married a fine sit-
uation wasnt it mary would have
agreed to try it-but it wouldnt have been
fair to her

  mary had told me you cant get ahead
where you are why dont you get into
another line of work somewhere that you
can advance

  thats fine mary i replied but what
line ive always got my eyes open for a
better job but i never seem to hear of a
really good job that i can handle mary
didnt seem to be satisfied with the answer
but i didnt know what else to tell her

  it was on the way home that night that i
stopped off in the neighborhood drug store
where i overheard a scrap of conversation
about myself a few burning words that
were the cause of the turning point in my
life

  with a hot flush of shame i turned and
left the store and walked rapidly home so
that was what my neighbors-the people
who knew me best-really thought of me

  bargain counter sheik-look how that
suit fits one fellow had said in a low
voice bet he hasnt got a dollar in those
pockets oh its just useless ander-
son said another hes got a wish-bone
where his back-bone ought to be

  as i thought over the words in deep hu-
miliation a sudden thought made me catch
my breath why had mary been so dissat-
isfied with my answer that i hadnt had a
chance did mary secretly think that too
and after all wasnt it true that i had a
wish-bone where my back-bone ought to
be wasnt that why i never had a
chance to get ahead it was true only
too true-and it had taken this cruel blow
to my self-esteem to make me see it

  with a new determination i thumbed the
pages of a magazine on the table searching
for an advertisement that id seen many
times but passed up without thinking an
advertisement telling of big opportunities
for trained men to succeed in the great new
radio field with the advertisement was a
coupon offering a big free book full of in-
formation i sent the coupon in and in a
few days received a handsome -page
book printed in two colors telling all about
the opportunities in the radio field and how
a man can prepare quickly and easily at
home to take advantage of these opportuni-
ties i read the book carefully and when i
finished it i made my decision

whats happened in the twelve months
since that day as ive already told
you seems almost like a dream to me now
for ten of those twelve months ive had a
radio business of my own at first of
course i started it as a little proposition on
the side under the guidance of the national
radio institute the outfit that gave me my
radio training it wasnt long before i
was getting so much to do in the radio line
that i quit my measly little clerical job and
devoted my full time to my radio business

  since that time ive gone right on up al-
ways under the watchful guidance of my
friends at the national radio institute
they would have given me just as much
help too if i had wanted to follow some
other line of radio besides building my
own retail business-such as broadcasting
manufacturing experimenting sea operat-

ing or any one of the score of lines they
prepare you for and to think that until
that day i sent for their eye-opening book
id been wailing i never had a chance

now im making real money i drive a
good-looking car of my own mary
and i dont own the house in full yet but
ive made a substantial down payment and
im not straining myself any to meet the
installments

  heres a real tip you may not be as
bad off as i was but think it over-are
you satisfied are you making enough
money at work that you like would you
sign a contract to stay where you are now
for the next ten years making the same
money if not youd better be doing some-
thing about it instead of drifting

  this new radio game is a live-wire field
of golden rewards the work in any of
the  different lines of radio is fascinat-
ing absorbing well paid  the national
radio institute-oldest and largest radio
home-study school in the world-will train
you inexpensively in your own home to
know radio from a to z and to increase
your earnings in the radio field

  take another tip-no matter what your
plans are no matter how much or how lit-
tle you know about radio-clip the coupon
below and look their free book over it is
filled with interesting facts figures and
photos and the information it will give
you is worth a few minutes of anybodys
time you will place yourself under no ob-
ligation-the book is free and is gladly
sent to anyone who wants to know about

 new amazing stories quarterly

 by hugo gernsback

ver since amazing stokies was first issued
there has been a persistent demand that the
magazine be issued twice a month a num-
ber of our readers even announced to us that
they wanted to have the magazine issued as a
weekly

  we have made an analysis of a great many thousands of
letters which we received and have come to the conclusion
that our readers actually wanted more amazing stories of
the scientifiction type accordingly we made an experi-
ment last summer and issued the amazing story year
book wherein we featured edgar rice burroughs story
the master mind of mars

  although this book sold at c it enjoyed an excellent
sale and we became convinced that tlnre certainly was a
demand for more amazing stories therefore it has
been decided that as a supplement to amazing stories we
will now publish an amazing stories quarterly this
will be published four times a year and will be on the news-
stands on the following dates

january th	july th

april th	october th

  in make-up it will be similar to the annual it will
sell for c but will contain a great deal more material
than is to be found in the regular issues of amazing
stories as a matter of fact it will contain twice as much
matter and will be profusely illustrated

  in the quarterly we will have a good chance to catch
up on our full-length novels of which we have a great many
excellent ones on band but which due to the time element
we cannot publish quickly enough in amazing stories
the usual full-length novel takes about three issues of
amazing stories whereas in the new quarterly we can
publish one or more full-length novels each issue

  heeding the demand of our readers the quarterly will
contain all new stories with the exception of two

  it will be noticed that the quarterly will be gotten out
between dates of amazing stories so that both will never
come together this will give you a chance to finish the
quarterly before the next issue of amazing stories comes
along again we believe this system is the best that we
could evolve to please all readers of all classes at least
that is what our exhaustive analysis determined we shall
be very glad to hear from our readers if they approve of
the plan we shall be very grateful for all suggestions
the first issue will contain the following stories

when the sleeper wakes
a complete novel
by h g wells
this with one or two possible exceptions is considered
mr wells masterpiece it shows the authors idea of the
world as it will exist centuries hence with all the wonderful
and amazing inventions and changes yet to come cities

covered entirely with glass-the world enslaved by money
power and machinery-a story so titanic in its strength and
action that you will never forget it

the nth man

                 a scientifiction novelette
by homer eon flint
this well-known writer has outdone himself in this
amazing fantastic piece of scientific literature what makes
giants why arc lilliputians two feet high and giants
eight and one-half feet tall what makes the giant turtle
of the galapagos these turtles or rather land tortoises
the largest known to science grow to such immense size
that they will support the weight of a number of full-grown
men furthermore they live to an enormous age some of
them for over  years suppose we should learn their
secret and apply it to the human race and rear human beings
the size of the woolworth building or even much larger
what would happen then  this is the story of the breeding
of the nth man really the most amazing scientifiction
tale we have seen this year

          the moon of doom
an interplanetary novelette
by earl l bell
it has often been stated that the discovery of atomic
energy by man would have a pronounced effect not only
upon mankind but possibly upon our entire planetary sys-
tem the release of atomic energy would be so tremendous
that as a result it is quite possible that the speed of the
earth on its axis might be changed such is the theme of
our new authors wondrous tale the moon of doom-a
novel sort of story that will keep your interest to the end
it is one of the most powerful and absorbing stories that it
has been our good fortune to read

          the atomic riddle
by edward s sears
knowledge of chemistry and general physics is of course
constantly increasing but when this knowledge is used by
law-breakers things are apt to become serious and some-
times it takes a professor of physics to vindicate an inno-
cent man who has become implicated here is a real high-
powered story with plenty of action that you will not soon
forget

          the gravity king
clelland j ball
gravity no doubt is one of the greatest mysteries of the
world we all know what happens when an apple falls
down due to gravity and we can dimly imagine what would
happen if we could stay the apple by negativing gravity
when one man finally solves the problem and uses the
knowledge for his own devices things will happen which
is indeed exactly the theme of this story

chapter i
what happened in the mountains

f i speak of myself in this story it is be-
cause i have been deeply involved in its
startling events events doubtless among
the most extraordinary which this twen-
tieth century will witness sometimes i
even ask myself if all this has really happened if
its pictures dwell in truth in my memory and not
merely in my imagination in my position as head
inspector in the federal police department in wash-
ington urged on moreover by the desire which
has alway been very strong in me to investigate
and understand everything which is mysterious i
naturally became much interested in these remark-
able occurrences and as i have been employed by
the government in various important affairs and
secret missions since i was a mere lad it also hap-
pened very naturally that the head of my department
placed in my charge this astonishing investigation
wherein i found myself wrestling with so many
impenetrable mysteries

   in the remarkable passages of the recital it is
important that you should believe my word for
some of the facts i can bring no other testimony
than my own if you do not wish to believe me so
be it i can scarce believe it all myself

   the strange occurrences began in the western part
of our great american state of north carolina
there deep amid the blue ridge mountains rises
the crest called the great eyrie its huge rounded
form is distinctly seen from the little town of mor-
ganton on the catawba river and still more clearly
as one approaches the mountains by the way of the
village of pleasant garden

   why the name of great eyrie was originally given
this mountain by the people of the surrounding
region i am not quite sure it rises rocky and grim
and inaccessible and under certain atmospheric con-
ditions has a peculiarly blue and distant effect but
the idea one would naturally get from the name is of
a refuge for birds of prey eagles condors vultures
the home of vast numbers of the feathered tribes
wheeling and screaming above peaks beyond the
reach of man now the great eyrie did not seem

particularly attractive to 

birds on the contrary the
people of the neighbor-
hood began to remark that
on some days when birds
approached its summit
they mounted still further
circled high above the
crest and then flew
swi ftly away troubling the
air with harsh cries

 why then the name

great eyrie perhaps the ---

mount might better have been called a crater for in
the center of those steep and mounted walls there
might well be a huge deep basin perhaps there
might even lie within their circuit a mountain lake
such as exists in other parts of the appalachian
mountain system a lagoon fed by the rain and the
winter snows

   in brief was this not the site of an ancient vol-
cano one which had slept through ages but whose
inner fires might yet reawake  might not the great
eyrie reproduce in its neighborhood the violence of



 j ii is is a sequel to the preceding story robur the
  conqueror published in the december and january
 issues of amazing stories in the present story jules
 verne begins the tale of the exploits of a most wonder-
 ful machine such as even we of today do not possess
 it is one of the fezv prophecies of jules verne which
 has not as yet been realised there are many engineers
 who claim that such a machine which is at once airship
 automobile and submarine will never be realised but
 there is a school which claims that it is not beyond the
 pale of possibility you will read this story with absorb-
 ing interest

mount k rakatoa or the terrible disaster of mont
pelee if there were indeed a central lake was
there not danger that its waters penetrating the
strata beneath would be turned to steam by the vol-
canic fires and tear their way forth in a tremendous
explosion deluging the fair plains of carolina with
an eruption such as that of  in martinique

   indeed with regard to this last possibility there
had been certain symptoms recently observed which
might well be due to volcanic action smoke had
floated above the mountain and once the country
folk passing near had heard subterranean noises un-
explainable rumblings a glow in the sky had
crowned the summit at night

   when the wind blew the smoky cloud eastward
toward pleasant garden a lew cinders and ashes
drifted down from it and finally one stormy night
pale flames reflected from the clouds above the sum-
mit cast upon the district below a sinister warning
light

   in presence of these strange phenomena it is not
astonishing that the people of the surrounding dis-
trict became seriously disquieted and to the dis-
quiet was joined an imperious need of knowing the
true condition of the mountain the carolina news-
papers had flaring headlines the mystery of great
eyrie i hey asked if it was not dangerous to
dwell in such a region their articles aroused curi-
osity and fear-curiosity among those who being in
no danger themselves were interested in the dis-
turbance merely as a strange phenomenon of nature
fear in those who were likely to be the victims if a
catastrophe actually occurred those more immedi-
ately threatened were the citizens of morganton and
even more the good folk of pleasant garden and of
the hamlets and farms yet closer to the mountain

   assuredly it was regrettable that mountain climb-
ers had not previously attempted to ascend to the
summit of the great eyrie the cliffs of rock which
surrounded it had never been scaled perhaps they
might offer no path by which even the most daring
climber could penetrate to the interior yet if a
volcanic eruption menaced all the western region of
the carolinas then a complete examination of the
mountain was oecome absolutely necessary

   now before the actual ascent of the crater with
------ - its many serious difficul-
ties was attempted there
was one way which offered
an opportunity of recon-
noitering the interior
without clambering up the
precipices in the first
days of september of that
memorable year a well-
known aeronaut named
wilker came to morgan-
ton with his balloon by
waiting for a breeze from
easily rise in his balloon and
eyrie there from a safe

the east he could

drift over the great  

height above he could search with a powerful glass
into its depths thus he would know if the mouth
of a volcano really opened amid the mighty rocks
this was the principal question i f this were settled
it would be known whether the surrounding country
must fear an eruption at some period more or less
distant

the ascension was begun according to the pro-
gram suggested the wind was fair and steady
amazing stories



the sky clear the morning clouds were disappearing
under the vigorous rays of the sun if the interior
of the great eyrie was not filled with smoke the
aeronaut would be able to search with his glass its
entire extent if the vapors were rising he no
doubt could detect their source

   the balloon rose at once to a height of fifteen
 hundred feet and there rested almost motionless for
 a quarter of an hour evidently the east wind
 which was brisk upon the surface of the earth did
 not make itself felt at that height then by an un-
 lucky chance the balloon was caught in an adverse
 current and began to drift toward the east its
 distance from the mountain chain rapidly increased
 despite all the efforts of the aeronaut the citizens
 of morganton saw the balloon disappear on the
 wrong horizon later they learned that it had
 landed in the neighborhood of raleigh the capital
 of north carolina

   this attempt having failed it was agreed that it
 should be tried again under better conditions in-
 deed fresh rumblings were heard from the moun-
 tain accompanied by heavy cloudy and wavering
 glimmerings of light at night folk began to realize
 that the great eyrie was a serious and perhaps immi-
 nent source of danger yes the entire country lay
 under the threat of some seismic or volcanic disaster

   during the first days of april of that year these
 more or less vague apprehensions turned to actual
 panic the newspapers gave prompt echo to the
 public terror the entire district between the moun-
 tains and morganton was sure that an eruption was
 at hand

   the night of the fourth of april the good folk
 of pleasant garden were awakened by a sudden
 uproar they thought that the mountains were fall-
 ing upon them they rushed from their houses
 ready for instant flight fearing to see open before
 them some immense abyss engulfing the farms and
 villages for miles around

   the night was very dark a weight of heavy
clouds pressed down upon the plain even had it
been day the crest of the mountains would have
been invisible

   in the midst of this impenetrable obscurity there
 was no response to the cries which arose from every
 side frightened groups of men women and chil-
 dren groped their way along the black roads in wild
 confusion from every quarter came the scream-
 ing voices it is an earthquake it is an erup-
 tion whence comes it from the great
 eyrie

   into morganton sped the news that stones lava
 ashes were raining down upon the country

   shrewd citizens of the town however observed
 that if there were an eruption the noise would have
 continued and increased the flames would have ap-
 peared above the crater or at least their lurid reflec-
 tions would have penetrated the clouds now even
 these reflections were no longer seen if there had
 been an earthquake the terrified people saw that at
 least their houses had not crumbled beneath the
 shock it was possible that the uproar had been
 caused by an avalanche or by the fall of some
 mighty rock from the summit of the mountains

   an hour passed without further incident a wind
 from the west sweeping over the long chain of the
 plue ridge set the pines and hemlocks wailing on
 the higher slopes there seemed no new cause for
 panic and folk bfcgan to return to their houses

 all however awaited impatiently the return of
 the day

   then suddenly toward three oclock in the morn-
 ing came another alarm flames leaped up above
 the rocky wall of the great eyrie reflected from
 the clouds they illuminated the atmosphere for a
 great distance a crackling as if of many burning
 trees was heard

   had a fire spontaneously broken out and to
 what cause was it due lightning could not have
 started the conflagration for no thunder had been
 heard true there was plenty of material for fire
 at this height the chain of the blue ridge is well
 wooded but these flames were too sudden for any
 ordinary cause

   an eruption an eruption

   the cry resounded from all sides an eruption
 the great eyrie was then indeed the crater of a
 volcano buried in the bowels of the mountains and
 after so many years so many ages even had it
 reawakened added to the flames was a rain of
 stones and ashes about to follow  were the lavas
 going to pour down torrents of molten fire destroy-
 ing everything in their passage annihilating the
 towns the villages the farms all this beautiful
 world of meadows fields and forests even as far
 as pleasant garden and morganton 

   this time the panic was overwhelming nothing
 could stop it women crazed with terror carrying
 their infants rushed along the eastward roads men
 deserting their homes made hurried bundles of their
 most precious belongings and set free their live-
 stock cows sheep pigs which fled in all directions
 what disorder resulted from this agglomeration
 human and animal under darkest night amid for-
 ests threatened by the fires of the volcano along
 the border of marshes whose waters might be up-
 heaved and overflow with the earth itself threaten-
 ing to disappear from under the feet of the fugi-
 tives would they be in time to save themselves if
 a cascade of glowing lava came rolling down the
 slope of the mountain across their route

   nevertheless some of the chief and shrewder
 farm owners were not swept away in this mad flight
 which they did their best to restrain venturing
 within a mile of the mountain they saw that the
 glare of the flames was decreasing in truth it
 hardly seemed that the region was immediately men-
 aced by any further upheaval no stones were
 being hurled into space no torrent of lava was visi-
 ble upon the slopes no rumblings rose from the
 ground there was no further manifestation of
 any seismic disturbance capable of overwhelming the
 land

   at length the flight of the fugitives ceased at a
 distance where they seemed secure from all danger
 then a few ventured back toward the mountain
 some farms were reoccupied before the break of day

   by morning the crests of the great eyrie showed
 scarcely the least remnant of its cloud of smoke
 the fires were certainly at an end and if it were
 impossible to determine their cause one might at
 least hope that they would not break out again

   tt appeared possible that the great eyrie had not
 reallv been the theater of volcanic phenomena at all
 there was no further evidence that the neighborhood
 was at the mercy either of eruptions or of earth-
 quakes

   yet once more about five oclock from beneath
 the ridge of the mountain where the shadows of
the master of the world



 night still lingered a strange noise swept across the
 air a sort of whirring accompanied by the beating
 of mighty wings and had it been a clear day per-
 haps the farmers would have seen the passage of a
 mighty bird of prey some monster of the skies
 which having risen from thegreat eyrie sped
 away toward the east

chapter ii
i reach morganton

the twenty-seventh of april having left
washington the night before i arrived at
raleigh the capital of the state of north
carolina two days before the head of the federal
police had called me to his room he was awaiting
me with some impatience john strock sid he
are you still the man who on so many occasions has
proven to me both his devotion and his ability
mr ward  answered with a bow i cannot
promise success or even ability but as to devotion
i assure  it is yours

i do not doubt it responded the chief and
i will ask you instead this more exact question are
you as fond of riddles as ever as eager to pene-
trate into mysteries as i have known you before
i am mr ward

  good strock then listen

  mr ward a man of about fifty years of great
power and intellect was fully master of the im-
portant position he filled he had several times
entrusted to me difficult missions which i had ac-
complished successfully and which had won me his
confidence for several months past however he
had found no occasion for my services therefore
i awaited with impatience what he had to say i
did not doubt that his questioning implied a serious
and important task for me

  doubtless you know said he what has hap-
pened down in the blue ridge mountains near
morganton

  surely mr ward the phenomena reported
from there have been singular enough to arouse
anyones curiosity

  they are singular even remarkable strock no
doubt about that but there is also reason to ask
if these phenomena about the great eyrie are not
a source of continued danger to the people there if
they are not forerunners of some disaster as terrible
as it is mysterious

  it is to be feared sir

  so we must know strock what is inside of that
mountain if we are helpless in the face of some
great force of nature people must be warned in time
of the danger which threatens diem

  it is clearly the duty of the authorities mr
ward responded i to learn what is going on
within there

  true strock but that presents great difficulties
everyone reports that it is impossible to scale the
precipices of the great eyrie and reach its interior
but has anyone ever attempted it with scientific
appliances and under the best conditions i doubt
it and believe a resolute attempt may bring success
nothing is impossible mr warl what we face
here is merely a question of expense

  we must not regard expense when we are seek-
ing to reassure an entire population or to preserve
it from a catastrophe there is another suggestion
i would make to you perhaps this great eyrie is

not so inaccessible as is supposed perhaps a band
of malefactors have secreted themselves there gain-
ing access by ways known only to themselves
what you suspect that robbers-

  perhaps i am wrong strock and these strange
sights and sounds have all had natural causes well
that is what we have to settle and as quickly as
possible

  i have one question to ask

  go ahead strock

  when the great eyrie has been visited when
we know the source of these phenomena if there
really is a crater there and an eruption is imminent
can we avert it 

  no strock but we can estimate the extent of
the danger if some volcano in the alleghanies
threatens north carolina with a disaster similar to
that of martinique buried beneath the outpourings
of mont pelee then these people must leave their
homes-

  i hope sir there is no such widespread danger
i think not strock it seems to me highly im-
probable that an activc volcano exists in the blue
ridge mountain chain our appalachian mountain
system is nowhere volcanic in its origin but all
these events cannot be without basis in short
strock we have decided to make a strict inquiry
into the phenomena of the great eyrie to gather all
the testimony to question the people of the towns
and farms to do this i have made choice of an
agent in whom we have full confidence and this
agent is you strock

  good i am ready mr ward cried i and
be sure that i shall neglect nothing to bring you
full information

  i know it strock and i will add that i regard
you as specially fitted for the work you will have
a splendid opportunity to exercise and i hope to
satisfy your favorite passion of curiosity

  as you say sir

  you will be free to act according to circum-
stances as to expenses if there seems reason to
organize an ascension party which will be costly
you have carte blanche

  i will act as seems best mr ward

  let me caution you to act with all possible dis-
cretion the people in the vicinity are already over-
excited it will be well to move secretly do not
mentioja the suspicions i have suggested to you and
above all avoid arousing any fresh panic

  it is understood

  you will be accredited to the mayor of morgan-
ton who will assist you once more be prudent
strock and acquaint no one with your mission
unless it is absolutely necessary you have often
given proofs of your intelligence and address and
this time i feel assured you will succeed

  t asked him only when shall i start
  to-morrow

  to-morrow t shall leave washington and the
day after t shall be at morganton

  how little suspicion had i of what the future had
in store for me

  t returned immediately to my house where i made
my preparations for departure and the next eve-
ning found me in raleigh there i passed the night
and in the course of the next afternoon arrived at
the railroad station of morganton

  morganton is but a small town built upon strata
of the jurassic period particularly rich in coal its


amazing stories

mines give it some prosperity it also has numer-
ous unpleasant mineral waters so that the season
there attracts many visitors around morganton is
a rich farming country with broad fields of grain
it lies in the midst of swamps covered with mosses
and reeds evergreen forests rise high up the moun-
tain slopes all that the region lacks is the wells of
natural gas that invaluable natural source of power
light and warmth so abundant in most of the alle-
ghany valleys villages and farms are numerous up
to the very borders of the mountain forests thus
there were many thousands of people threatened if
the great eyrie proved indeed a volcano if the con-
vulsions of nature extended to pleasant garden and
to morganton

  the mayor of morganton mr elias smith was
a tall man vigorous and enterprising forty years
old or more and of a health to defy all the doctors
of the two americas he was a great hunter of
bears and panthers beasts which may still be found
in the wild gorges and mighty forests of the
alleghanies

  mr smith was himself a rich land-owner pos-
sessing several farms in the neighborhood even his
most distant tenants received frequent visits from
him indeed whenever his official duties did not
keep him in his so-called home at morganton he
was exploring the surrounding country irresistibly
drawn by the instincts of the hunter

  i went at once to the house of mr smith he
was expecting me having been warned by telegram
he received me very frankly without any formality
his pipe in his mouth a glass of brandy on the table
a second glass was brought in by a servant and i
had to drink to my host before beginning our
interview

  mr ward sent you said he to me in a jovial
tone good let us drink to mr wards health

  i clinked glasses with him and drank in honor of
the chief of police

  and now demanded elias smith what is
worrying him

  at this i made known to the mayor of morganton
the cause and the purpose of my mission in north
carolina i assured him that my chief had given
me full power and would render me every assist-
ance financial and otherwise to solve the riddle and
relieve the neighborhood of its anxiety relative to
the great eyrie

  elias smith listened to me without uttering a
word but not without several times refilling his glass
and mine while he puffed steadily at his pipe the
close attention which he gave me was beyond ques-
tion i saw his cheeks flush at times and his eyes
gleam under their bushy brows evidently the chief
magistrate of morganton was uneasy about great
eyrie and would be as eager as i to discover the
cause of these phenomena

  when i had finished my communication elias
smith gazed at me for some moments in silence
then he said softly so at washington they wish
to know what the great eyrie hides within its
circuit 

  yes mr smith

  and you also

  i do

  so do i mr strock

  he and i were as one in our curiosity

  you will understand added he knocking the
cinders from his pipe that as a land-owner i am

much interested in these stories of the great eyrie
and as mayor i wish to protect my constituents

  a double reason i commented to stimulate
you to discover the cause of these extraordinary
occurrences without doubt my dear mr smith
they have appeared to you as inexplicable and threat-
ening as to your people

  inexplicable certainly mr strock for on my
part i do not believe it possible that the great eyrie
can be a volcano the alleghanies are nowhere of
volcanic origin i myself in our immediate district
have never found any geological traces of scoria or
lava or any eruptive rock whatever i do not think
therefore that morganton can possibly be threatened
from such a source

  you really think not mr smith 

  certainly

  but these tremblings of the earth that have been
felt in the neighborhood

  yes these tremblings these tremblings re-
peated mr smith shaking his head but in the first
place is it certain that there have been tremblings
at the moment when the flames showed most sharply
i was on my farm of wildon less than a mile from
the great eyrie there was certainly a tumult in
the air but i felt no quivering of the earth

  but in the reports sent to mr ward-

  reports made under the impulse of the panic
interrupted the mayor of morganton i said noth-
ing of any earth tremors in mine

  but as to the flames which rose clearly above
the crest 

  yes as to those mr strock that is different i
saw them saw them with my own eyes and the
clouds certainly reflected them for miles around
moreover noises certainly came from the crater of
the great eyrie hissings as if a great boiler were
letting off steam

  you have reliable testimony of this

  yes the evidence of my own ears

  and in the midst of this noise mr smith did
you believe that you heard that most remarkable of
all the phenomena a sound like the flapping of great
wings 

  i thought so mr strock but what mighty bird
could this be which flew away after the flames had
died down and what wings could ever make such
tremendous sounds i therefore seriously question
if this must not have been a deception of my im-
agination the great eyrie a refuge for unknown
monsters of the sky would they not have been
seen long since soaring above their immense nest of
stone  in short there is in all this a mystery which
has not yet been solved

  but we will solve it mr smith if you will give
me your aid

  surely mr strock to-morrow we will start our
campaign

  to-morrow and on that word the mayor and
i separated i went to a hotel and established my-
self for a stay which might be indefinitely prolonged
then having dined and written to mr ward i
saw mr smith again in the afternoon and arranged
to leave morganton with him at daybreak

  our first purpose was to undertake the ascent of
the mountain with the aid of two experienced guides
these men had ascended mt mitchell and others of
the highest peaks of the blue ridge they had
never however attempted the great eyrie knowing
that its walls of inaccessible cliffs defended it on
the master of the world



every side moreover before the recent startling
occurrences the great eyrie had not particularly
attracted the attention of tourists mr smith knew
the two guides personally as men daring skillful
and trustworthy they would stop at no obstacle
and we were resolved to follow them through every-
thing

   moreover mr smith remarked at the last that
perhaps it was no longer as difficult as formerly to
penetrate within the great eyrie

   and why  asked l

   because a huge block has recently broken away
from the mountainside and perhaps it has left a
practicable path or entrance

   that would be a fortunate chance mr smith

   we shall know all about it mr strock no iater
than to-morrow

   till to-morrow then

            chapter iii
            the great eyrie

the next day at dawn elias smith and i left
morganton by a road which winding along
the left bank of the catawba river led to
the village of pleasant garden the guides accom-
panied us harry horn a man of thirty and james
brack aged twenty-five they were both natives
of the region and in constant demand among the
tourists who climbed the peaks of the blue ridge
and cumberland mountains

   a light wagon with two good horses was provided
to carry us to the foot of the range it contained
provisions for two or three days beyond which our
trip surely would not be protracted mr smith
had shown himself a generous provider both in
meats and in liquors as to water the mountain
springs would furnish it in abundance increased by
the heavy rains frequent in that region during
springtime

   it is needless to add that the mayor of morgan-
ton in his role of hunter had brought along his gun
and his dog nisko who gamboled joyously about
the wagon nisko however was to remain behind
at the farm at wildon when we attempted our
asccnt he could not possibly follow us up the
great eyrie with its cliffs lo scale and its crevasses
to cross

   the day was beautiful the fresh air in that cli-
mate is still cool of an april morning a few fleecy
clouds sped rapidly overhead driven by a light
breeze which swept across the long plains from the
distant atlantic the sun peeping forth at inter-
vals illumined all the fresh young verdure of the
countryside

  an entire world animated the woods through
which we passed from before our equipage fled
squirrels field-mice parroquets of brilliant colors
and deafening loquacity oppossums passed in hur-
ried gait bearing their young in their pouches
myriads of birds were scattered amid the foliage
of maples pines and masses of rhododendrons so
luxuriant that their thickets were impenetrable

  we arrived that evening at pleasant garden
where we were comfortably located for the night
with the mayor of the town a particular friend of
mr smith pleasant garden proved little more
than a village but its mayor gave us a warm and
generous reception and we supped pleasantly in his

charming home which stood beneath the shades of
some giant beech-trees

  naturally the conversation turned upon our at-
tempt to explore the interior of the great eyrie
you are right said our host until we all know
what is hidden within there our people will remain
uneasy

   has nothing new occurred i asked since the
last appearance of flames above the great eyrie
nothing mr strock from pleasant garden we
can see the entire crest of the mountain not a
suspicious noise has come down to us not a spark
has risen t f a legion of devils is in hiding there
they must have finished their infernal cookery and
soared away to some other haunt

  devils cried mr smith well i hope they
have not decamped without leaving some traces of
their occupation some parings of hoofs or horns
or their tails we shall find them out

  on the morrow the twenty-ninth of april we
started again at dawn by the end of this second
day we expected to reach the farm of wildon at
the foot of the mountain the country was much
the same as before except that our road led more
steeply upward woods and marshes alternated
though the latter grew sparser being drained by the
sun as we approached the higher levels the coun-
try was also less populous there were only a few
little hamlets almost lost beneath the beech trees
a few lonely farms abundantly watered by the many
streams that rushed downward toward the catawba
river

  he smaller birds and beasts grew yet more
numerous i am much tempted to take my gun
said mr smith and to go off with nisko this
will be the first time that i have passed here with-
out trying my luck with the partridges and hares
he good beasts will not recognize me but not
only have we plenty of provisions but we have a
bigger chase on hand to-day the chase of a
mystery

   and let us hope added i we do not come back
disappointed hunters

  in the afternoon the whole chain of the blue
ridge stretched before us at a distance of only six
miles the mountain crests were sharply outlined
against the clear sky well wooded at the base they
grew more bare and showed only stunted evergreens
toward the summit there the scraggly trees gro-
tesquely twisted gave to the rocky heights a bleak
and bizarre appearance here and there the ridge
rose in sharp peaks on our right the black moun-
tains nearly seven thousand feet high reared their
gigantic head sparkling at times high above the
clouds

  have you ever climbed that mountain mr
smith i asked

  no answered he but i am told that it is a
very difficult ascent a few mountaineers have
climbed it but they report that it has no outlook
commanding the crater of the great eyrie

  that is so said the guide harry horn i
have tried it myself

  perhaps suggested i the weather was un-
favorable

  on the contrary mr strock it was unusually
clear but the wall of the great eyrie on that side
rose so high it completely hid the interior
forward cried mr smith i shall not be


amazing stories

sorry to set foot where  person has ever stepped
or even looked before

  certainly on this day the great eyrie looked tran-
quil enough as we gazed upon it there rose from
its heights neither smoke nor flame

  toward live oclock our expedition halted at the
wildon farm where the tenants warmly welcomed
their landlord the farmer assured us that nothing
notable had happened about the great eyrie for
some time we supped at a common table with all
the people of the farm and our sleep that night
was sound and wholly untroubled by premonitions
of the future

  on the morrow before break of day we set out
for the ascent of the mountain the height of the
great eyrie scarce exceeds five thousand feet a
modest altitude often surpassed in this section of
the appalachians as we were already more than
three thousand feet above sea level the fatigue of
the ascent could not be great a few hours should
suffice to bring us to the edge of the crater of
course difficulties might present themselves preci-
pices to scale clefts and breaks in the ridge might
necessitate painful and even dangerous detours
this was the unknown the spur to our attempt as
i said our guides knew no more than we upon this
point what made me anxious was of course the
common report that the great eyrie was wholly
inaccessible but this remained unproven and
then there was the new chance that a fallen block
had left a breach in the rock wall

  at last said mr smith to me after lighting
the first pipe of the twenty or more which he smoked
each day we are well started as to whether the

ascent will take more or less time-

  in any case mr smith interrupted i you and
i are fully resolved to pursue our quest to the end
fully resolved mr strock

  my chief has charged me to snatch the secret
from this demon of the great eyrie

  we will snatch it from him willing or unwill-
ing vowed mr smith calling heaven to witness
even if we have to search the very bowels of the
mountain

  as it may happen then said i that our ex-
cursion will be prolonged beyond to-day it will be
well to look to our provisions

  be easy mr strock our guides have food for
two days in their knapsacks besides what we carry
ourselves moreover though i left my brave nisko
at the farm i have my gun game will be plentiful
in the woods and gorges of the lower part of the
mountain and perhaps at the top we shall find a
fire to cook it already lighted

  already lighted mr smith

  and why not mr strock these flames these
superb flames which have so terrified our country
folk is their fire absolutely cold is no spark to
be found beneath their ashes and then if this is
truly a crater is the volcano so wholly extinct that
we cannot find there a single ember bah this
would be but a poor volcano if it hasnt enough fire
even to cook an egg or roast a potato come i
repeat we shall see we shall see

  at that point of the investigation i had i con-
fess no opinion formed i had my orders to exam-
ine the great eyrie if it proved harmless i would
announce it and people would be reassured but
at heart i must admit i had the very natural desire

of a man possessed by the demon of curiosity t
should be glad both for my own sake and for the
renown which would attach to my mission if the
great eyrie proved the center of the most remark-
able phenomena-of which i would discover the
cause

our ascent began in this order the two guides
went in front to seek out the most practicable
paths elias smith and i followed more leisurely
we mounted by a narrow and not very steep gorge
amid rocks and trees a tiny stream trickled down-
ward under our feet during the rainy season or
after a heavy shower the water doubtless bounded
from rock to rock in tumultuous cascades but it
evidently was fed only by the rain for now we could
scarcely trace its course it could not be the outlet
of any lake within the great eyrie

  after an hour of climbing the slope became so
steep that we had to turn now to the right now to
the left and our progress was much delayed soon
the gorge became wholly impracticable its cliff-like
sides offered no sufficient foothold we had to cling
by branches to crawl upon our knees at this rate
the top would not be reached before sundown

  faith cried mr smith stopping for breath
i realize why the climbers of the great eyrie have
been few so few that it has never been ascended
within my knowledge

  the fact is i responded that it would be much
toil for very little profit and if we had not special
reasons to persist in our attempt--

  you never said a truer word declared harry
horn my comrade and i have scaled the black
dome several times but we never met such obstacles
as these

  the difficulties seem almost impassable added
james bruck

  the question now was to determine to which side
we should turn for a new route to right as to left
arose impenetrable masses of trees and bushes in
truth even the scaling of cliffs would have been more
easy perhaps if we could get above this wooded
slope we could advance with surer foot now we
could only go ahead blindly and trust to the instincts
of our two guides james bruck was especially use-
ful i believe that that gallant lad would have
equaled a monkey in lightness and a wild goat in
agility unfortunately neither elias smith nor i
was able to climb where he could

  however when it is a matter of real need with
me i trust i shall never be backward being resolute
by nature and well-trained in bodily exercise where
james bruck went i was determined to go also
though it might cost me some uncomfortable falls
but it was not the same with the first magistrate
of morganton less young less vigorous larger
stouter and less persistent than we others plainly
he made every effort not to retard our progress
but he panted like a seal and soon i insisted on his
stopping to rest

  in short it was evident that the ascent of the
great eyrie would require far more time than we
had estimated we had expected to reach the foot
of the rocky wall before eleven oclock but we now
saw that mid-day would still find us several hundred
feet below it

  toward ten oclock after repeated attempts to
discover some more practicable route after num-
the master of the world



berless turnings and returnings one of the guides
gave the signal to halt we found ourselves at last
on the upper border of the heavy wood the trees
more thinly spaced permitted us a glimpse upward
to the base of the rock wall which constituted the
true great eyrie

  whew exclaimed mr smith leaning against
a mighty pine tree a little respite a little repose
and even a little repast would not go badly

  we will rest an hour said i

  yes after working our lungs and our legs we
will make our stomachs work

  we were all agreed on this point a rest would
certainly freshen us our only cause for inquietude
was now the appearance of the precipitous slope
above us we looked up toward one of thbse bare
strips called in that region slides amid tliis loose
earth these yielding stones and these abrupt rocks
there was no roadway

  harry horn said to his comrade it will not be
easy

  perhaps impossible responded bruck

  their comments caused me secret uneasiness if
i returned without even having scaled the mountain
my mission would be a complete failure without
speaking of the torture to my curiosity and when
i stood again before mr ward shamed and con-
fused i should cut but a sorry figure

  we opened our knapsacks and lunched moderately
on bread and cold meat our repast finished in less
than half an hour mr smith sprang up eager to
push forward once more james bruck took the
lead and we had only to follow him as best we
could

  we advanced slowly our guides did not at-
tempt to conceal their doubt and hesitation soon
horn left us and went far ahead to spy out which
road promised most chance of success

  twenty minutes later he returned and led us
onward toward the northwest it was on this side
that the black dome rose at a distance of three or
four miles our path was still difficult and painful
amid the sliding stones held in place only occasion-
ally by wiry bushes at length after a weary
struggle we gained some two hundred feet further
upward and found ourselves facing a great gash
which broke the earth at this spot here and there
were scattered roots recently uptorn branches broken
off huge stones reduced to powder as if an ava-
lanche had rushed down this flank of the mountain

  that must be the path taken by the huge block
which broke away from the great eyrie com-
mented james bruck

  no doubt answered mr smith and i think
we had better follow the road that it has made
for us

  it was indeed this gash that harry horn had
selected for our ascent our feet found lodgment
in the firmer earth which had resisted the passage
of the monster rock our task thus became much
easier and our progress was in a straight line up-
ward so that toward half past eleven we reached
the upper border of the slide

  before us less than a hundred feet away but
towering a hundred feet straight upwards in the air
rose the rock wall which formed the final crest
the last defence of the great eyrie

  from this side the summit of the wall showed
capriciously irregular rising in rude towers and

jagged needles at one point the outline appeared
to be an enormous eagle silhouetted against the sky
just ready to take flight upon this side at least
the precipice was insurmountable

  rest a minute said mr smith and we will 
see if it is possible to make our way around the
base of this cliff

  at any rate said harry horn the great block
must have fallen from this part of the cliff and it
has left no breach for entering

  they were both right we must seek entrance
elsewhere after a rest of ten minutes we clamb-
ered up close to the foot of the wall and began to
make a circuit of its base

  assuredly the great eyrie now took on to my
eyes an aspect absolutely fantastic its heights
seemed peopled by dragons and huge monsters if
chimeras griffins and all the creations of mythology
had appeared to guard it i should have beenscarcely
surprised

  with great difficulty and not without danger we
continued our tour of this circumvallation where
it seemed that nature had worked as man does with
careful regularity nowhere was there any break
in the fortification nowhere a fault in the strata by
which one might clamber up always this mighty
wall a hundred feet in height

  after an hour and a half of this laborious circuit
we regained our starting-place i could not conceal
my disappointment and mr smith was not less
chagrined than i

  a thousand devils cried he we know no bet-
ter than before what is inside this confounded great
eyrie nor even if it is a crater

  volcano or not said i there are no suspicious
noises now neither smoke nor flame rises above it
nothing whatever threatens an eruption

  this was true a profound silence reigned around
us and a perfectly clear sky shone overhead we
tasted the perfect calm of great altitudes

  it was worth noting that the circumference of
the huge wall was about twelve or fifteen hundred
feet as to the space enclosed within we could
scarce reckon that without knowing the thickness of
the encompassing wall the surroundings were
absolutely deserted probably not a living creature
ever mounted to this height except the few birds
of prey which soared high above us

  our watches showed three oclock and mr smith
cried in disgust what is the use of stopping here
all day we shall learn nothing more we must
make a start mr strock if we want to get back
to pleasant garden to-night

  i made no answer and did not move from where
i was seated so he called again come mr strock
you dont answer

  in truth it cut me deeply to abandon our effort
to descend the slope without having achieved my
mission i felt an imperious need of persisting my
curiosity had redoubled but what could i do
could t tear open this unyielding earth overleap
the mighty cliff throwing one last defiant glare
at the great eyrie i followed my companions

  the return was effected without great difficulty
we had only to slide down where we had so labori-
ously scrambled up before five oclock we de-
scended the last slopes of the mountain and the
farmer of wildon welcomed us to a much needed
meal


amazing stories

   then you didnt get inside said he

  no responded mr smith and i believe that
the inside exists only in the imagination of our coun-
try folk

  at half past eight our carriage drew up before
the house of the mayor of pleasant garden where
we passed the night while i strove vainly to sleep
i asked myself if i should not stop there in the vil-
lage and organize a new ascent but what better
chance had it of succeeding than the first the
wisest course was doubtless to return to washing-
ton and consult mr ward

   so the next day having rewarded our two guides
i took leave of mr smith at morganton and that
same evening left by train for washington

         chapter iv	

a meeting of the automobile club

was the mystery of the great eyrie to be
solved some day by chances beyond our
imagining that was known only to the
future and was the solution a matter of the first
importance that was beyond doubt since the
safety of the people of western carolina perhaps
depended upon it

  yet a fortnight after my return to washington
public attention was wholly distracted from this
problem by another very different in nature but
equally astonishing

  toward the middle of that month of may the
newspapers of pennsylvania informed their readers
of some strange occurrence in different parts of the
state on the roads which radiated from philadel-
phia the chief city there circulated an extraordinary
vehicle of which no one could describe the form
or the nature or even the size so rapidly did it rush
past it was an automobile all were agreed on that
but as to what motor drove it only imagination
could say and when the popular imagination is
aroused what limit is there to its hypotheses

  at that period the most improved automobiles
whether driven by steam gasoline or electricity
could not accomplish much more than sixty miles
an hour a speed that the railroads with their most
rapid expresses scarce exceed on the best lines of
america and europe now this new automobile
which was astonishing the world traveled at more
than double this speed

   it is needless to add that such a rate constituted
an extreme danger on the highroads as much so
for vehicles as for pedestrians this rushing mass
coming like a thunder-bolt preceded by a formidable
rumbling caused a whirlwind which tore the
branches from the trees along the road terrified the
animals browsing in adjoining fields and scattered
and killed the birds which could not resist the suc-
tion of the tremendous air currents engendered by
its passage

  and a bizarre detail to which the newspapers
drew particular attention the surface of the roads
was scarcely even scratched by the wheels of the
apparition which left behind it no such ruts as are
usually made by heavy vehicles at most there was
a light touch a mere brushing of the dust it was
only the tremendous speed which raised behind the
vehicle such whirlwinds of dust

  it is probable commented the nezv york her-

ald that the extreme rapidity of motion destroys
the weight

   naturally there were protests from all sides it
was impossible to permit the mad speed of this
apparition which threatened to overthrow and de-
stroy everything in its passage equipages and people
but how could it be stopped no one knew to whom
the vehicle belonged nor whence it came nor whither
it went it was seen but for an instant as it darted
forward like a bullet in its dizzy flight how could
one seize a cannon-ball in the air as it leaped from
the mouth of the gun

    repeat there was no evidence as to the character
of the propelling engine it left behind it no smoke
no steam no odor of gasoline or of any fuel oil it
seemed probable therefore that the vehicle ran by
electricity and that its accumulators were of an un-
known model using some unknown fluid

   the public imagination highly excited readily ac-
cepted every sort of rumor about this mysterious
automobile it was said to be a supernatural car
it was driven by a specter by one of the chauffeurs
of hell a goblin from another world a monster
escaped from some mythological menagerie in short
the devil in person who could defy all human inter-
vention having at his command invisible and infinite
satanic powers

  but even satan himself had no right to run at
such speed over the roads of the united states with-
out a special permit without a number on his car
and without a regular license and it was certain
that not a single municipality had given him per-
mission to go two hundred miles an hour public
security demanded that some means be found to
unmask the secret of this terrible chauffeur

  moreover it was not only pennsylvania that
served as the theater of his sportive eccentricities
the police reported his appearance in other states
in kentucky near frankfort in ohio near colum-
bus in tennessee near nashville in missouri near
jefferson and finally in illinois in the neighborhood
of chicago

   the alarm having been given it became the duty
of the authorities to take steps against this public
danger to arrest or even to halt an apparition
moving at such speed was scarcely practicable a
better way would be to erect across the roads solid
gateways with which the flying machine must come
in contact sooner or later and be smashed into a
thousand pieces

   nonsense declared the incredulous this mad-
man would know well how to circle around such
obstructions

  and if necessary added others the machine
would leap over the barriers

   and if he is indeed the devil he has as a former
angel presumably preserved his wings and so he
will take to flight

   but this last was but the suggestion of foolish
old gossips who did not stop to study the matter
for if the king of hades possessed a pair of wings
why did he obstinately persist in running around on
the earth at the risk of crushing his own subjects
when he might more easily have hurled himself
through space as free as a bird

   such was the situation when in the last week of
may a fresh event occurred which seemed to show
that the united states was indeed helpless in the
hands of some unapproachable monster and after
the master of the world



the new world would not the old in its turn be
desecrated by the mad career of this remarkable
automobilist 

  the following occurrence was reported in all the
newspapers of the union and with what comments
and outcries it is easy to imagine

  a race was to be held by the automobile club of
wisconsin over the roads of that state of which
madison is the capital the route laid out formed
an excellent track about two hundred miles in length
starting from prairie du chien on the western fron-
tier passing by madison and ending a little above
milwaukee on the shore of lake michigan except
for the japanese road between nikko and namode
bordered by giant cypresses there is no better track
in the world than this of wisconsin it runs straight
and level as an arrow for sometimes fifty miles at a
stretch many and noted were the machines entered
for this great race every kind of motor vehicle was
permitted to compete even motorcycles as well as
automobiles the machines were of all makes and
nationalities the sum of the different prizes reached
fifty thousand dollars so that the race was sure to
be desperately contested new records were ex-
pected to be made

  calculating on the maximum speed hitherto at-
tained of perhaps eighty miles an hour this inter-
national contest covering two hundred miles would
last about three hours and to avoid all danger
the state authorities of wisconsin had forbidden all
other traffic between prairie du chien and mil-
waukee during three hours on the morning of the
thirtieth of may thus if there were any acci-
dents those who suffered would be themselves to
blame

  there was an enormous crowd and it was not
composed only of the people of wisconsin many
thousands gathered from the neighboring states of
illinois michigan iowa indiana and even from
new york among the sportsmen assembled were
many foreigners english french germans and
austrians each nationality of course supporting
the chauffeurs of its land moreover as this was
the united states the country of the greatest gamb-
lers of the world bets were made of every sort and
of enormous amounts

  the start was to be made at eight oclock in the
morning and to avoid crowding and the accidents
which must result from it the automobiles were to
start at two minute intervals and race along the
roads whose borders were black with spectators

  the first ten racers numbered by lot were dis-
patched between eight oclock and twenty minutes
past unless there was some disastrous accident
some of these machines would surely arrive at the
goal by eleven oclock the others would follow in
order

  an hour and a half had passed there remained
but a single contestant at prairie du chien word
was sent back and forth by telephone every five min-
utes as to the order of the racers midway between
madison and milwaukee the lead was held by a
machine of renault brothers four-cylinder of
twenty horsepower and with michelin tires it was
closely followed by a harvard-watson car and by
a de dion-bouton some accidents had already
occurred other machines were hopelessly behind
not more than a dozen would contest the finish
several chauffeurs had been-injured but not seri-

ously and even had they been killed the death of
men is but a detail not considered of great impor-
tance in that astonishing country of america

  naturally the excitement became more intense as
one approached the finishing line near milwaukee
there were assembled the most curious the most
interested and there the passions of the moment
were unchained by ten oclock it was evident that
the first prize twenty thousand dollars lay between
five machines two american two french and one
english imagine therefore the fury with which
bets were being made under the influence of national
pride the regular book makers could scarcely meet
the demands of those who wished to wajjer offers
and amounts were hurled from lip to lip with fever-
ish rapidity one to three on the harvard-
watson 

  one to two on the de dion-bouton

  even money on the renault

  these cries rang along the line of spectators at
each new announcement from the telephones

  suddenly at half-past nine by the town clock of
prairie du chien two miles beyond that town was
heard a tremendous noise and rumbling which pro-
ceeded from the midst of a flying cloud of dust
accompanied by shrieks like those of a naval siren

  scarcely had the crowds time to draw to one side
to escape a destruction which would have included
hundreds of victims the cloud swept by like a
hurricane no one could distinguish what it was
that passed with such speed there was no exag-
geration in saying that its rate was at least one hun-
dred and fifty miles an hour

  the apparition passed and disappeared in an in-
stant leaving behind it a long train of white dust as
an express locomotive leaves behind a train of smoke
evidently it was an automobile with a most extraor-
dinary motor if it maintained this arrow-like speed
it would reach the contestants in the fore-front of
the race it would pass them with this speed double
their own it would arrive first at the goal

  and then from all parts arose an uproar as soon
as the spectators had nothing more to fear

  it is that infernal machine

  yes the one the police cannot stop

  but it has not been heard of for a fortnight

  it was supposed to be done for destroyed gone
forever

  it is a devils car driven by hellfire and with
satan driving 

  in truth if he were not the devil who could this
mysterious chauffeur be driving with this unbeliev-
able velocity his no less mysterious machine at
least it was beyond doubt that this was the same
machine which had already attracted so much atten-
tion if the police believed that they had frightened
it away that it was never to be heard of more well
the police were mistaken-which happens in america
as elsewhere

  the first stunned moment of surprise having
passed many people rushed to the telephones to
warn those further along the route of the danger
which menaced not only the people but also the
automobiles scattered along the road

  when this terrible madman arrived like an ava-
lanche they would be smashed to pieces ground into
powder annihilated

  and from the collision might not the destroyer
himself emerge safe and sound he must be so


amazing stories

adroit this chauffeur of chauffeurs he must handle
his machine with such perfection of eye and hand
that he knew no doubt how to escape from every
situation fortunately the wisconsin authorities had
taken such precautions that the road would be clear
except for contesting automobiles but what right
had this machine among them

  and what said the racers themselves who warned
by telephone had to sheer aside from the road in
their struggle for the grand prize by their esti-
mate this amazing vehicle was going at least one
hundred and thirty miles an hour fast as was their
speed it shot by them at such a rate that they could
hardly make out even the shape of the machine a
sort of lengthened spindle probably not over thirty
feet long its wheels spun with such velocity that
they could scarce be seen for the rest the machine
left behind it neither smoke nor scent

  as for the driver hidden in the interior of his
machine he had been quite invisible he remained
as unknown as when he had first appeared on the
various roads throughout the country

  milwaukee was promptly warned of the coming
of this interloper fancy the excitement the news
caused the immediate purpose agreed upon was to
stop this projectile to erect across its route an ob-
stacle against which it would smash into a thousand
pieces but was there time would not the machine
appear at any moment and what need was there
since the track ended on the edge of lake michigan
and the vehicle would therefore be forced to stop
there anyway unless its supernatural driver could
ride the water as well as the land

  here also as all along the route the most extrava-
gant suggestions were offered even those who
would not admit that the mysterious chauffeur must
be satan in person allowed that he might be some
monster escaped from the fantastic visions of the
apocalypse

  and now there were no longer minutes to wait
any second might bring the expected apparition

  it was not yet eleven oclock when a rumbling was
heard far down the track and the dust rose in violent
whirlwinds harsh whistlings shrieked through the
air warning all to give passage to the monster

  it did not slacken speed at the finish lake
michigan was not half a mile beyond and the ma-
chine must certainly be hurled into the water could
it be that the mechanician was no longer master of
his mechanism

  there could be little doubt of it like a shooting
star the vehicle flashed through milwaukee when
it had passed the city would it plunge itself to de-
struction in the water of lake michigan

  at any rate when it disappeared at a slight bend
in the road no trace was to be found of its passage

chapter v
along the shores of new england

at the time when the newspapers were filled
with these reports i was again in washing-
 ton on my return i had presented myself at
my chiefs office but had been unable to see him
family affairs had suddenly called him away to be
absent some weeks mr ward however undoubt-
edly knew of the failure of my mission the news-
papers especially those of north carolina had given
full details of our ascent of the great eyrie

  naturally i was much annoyed by this delay which
further fretted my restless curiosity  could turn
to no other plans for the future could i give up
the hope of learning the secret of the great eyrie
no i would return to the attack a dozen times if
necessary and despite every failure

  surely the winning of access within those walls
was not a task beyond human power a scaffolding
might be raised to the summit of the cliff or a tun-
nel might be pierced through its depth our engi-
neers met problems more difficult every day but
in this case ft was necessary to consider the expense
which might easily grow out of proportion to the
advantages to be gained a tunnel would cost many
thousand dollars and what good would it accom-
plish beyond satisfying the public curiosity and
my own

  my personal resources were wholly insufficient
for the achievement mr ward who held the gov-
ernments funds was away i even thought of try-
ing to interest some millionaire oh if i could but
have promised one of them some gold or silver mines
within the mountain but such an hypothesis was
not admissible the chain of the appalachians is
not situated in a gold bearing region like that of
the pacific mountains the transvaal or australia

  it was not until the fifteenth of june that mr
ward returned to duty despite my lack of success
he received me warmly here is our poor strock
cried he at my entrance our poor strock who
has failed

  no more mr ward than if you had charged
me to investigate the surface of the moon answered
i we found ourselves face to face with purely
natural obstacles insurmountable with the forces
then at our command

  i do not doubt that strock i do not doubt that
in the least nevertheless the fact remains that you
have discovered nothing of what is going on within
the great eyrie

  nothing mr ward

  you saw no sign of fire

  none

  and you heard no suspicious noises whatever
  none 

  then it is still uncertain if there is really a vol-
cano there

 still uncertain mr ward but if it is there
we have good reason to believe that it has sunk into
a profound sleep

  still returned mr ward there is nothing to
show that it will not wake up again any day strock
it is not enough that a volcano should sleep it must
be absolutely extinguished-unless indeed all these
threatening rumors have been born solely in the
carolinian imagination

  that is not possible sir i said both mr
smith the mayor of morganton and iis friend the
mayor of pleasant garden are reliable men and
they speak from their own knowledge in this matter
flames have certainly risen above the great eyrie
strange noises have issued from it there can be
no doubt whatever of the reality of these phe-
nomena

  granted declared mr ward i admit that
the evidence is unassailable so the deduction to
be drawn is that the great eyrie has not yet given
up its secret

  if we are determined to know it mr ward the
the master of the world



solution is only a solution of expense pickaxes
and dynamite would soon conquer those walls

  no doubt responded the chief but such an
undertaking hardly seems justified since the moun-
tain is now quiet we will wait awhile and perhaps
nature herself will disclose her mystery

  mr ward believe me that i regret deeply that
i have been unable to solve the problem you entrusted
to me i said

  nonsense do not upset yourself strock take
your defeat philosophically we cannot always be
successful even in the police how many criminals
escape us i believe we should never capture one
of them if they were a little more intelligent and
less imprudent and if they did not compromise them-
selves so stupidly nothing it seems to me would
be easier than to plan a crime a theft or an assassi-
nation and to execute it without arousing any sus-
picions or leaving any traces to be followed you
understand strock i do not want to give our crimi-
nals lessons i much prefer to have them remain as
they are nevertheless there are many whom the
police will never be able to track down

  on this matter i shared absolutely the opinion of
my chief it is among rascals that one finds the
most fools for this very reason i had been much
surprised that none of the authorities had been able
to throw any light upon the recent performances of
the demon automobile and when mr ward
brought up this subject i did not conceal from him
my astonishment

  he pointed out that the vehicle was practically
unpursuable that in its earlier appearances it had
apparently vanished from all roads even before a
telephone message could be sent ahead active and
numerous police agents had been spread throughout
the country but no one of them had encountered the
delinquent he did not move continuously from
place to place even at his amazing speed but seemed
to appear only for a moment and then to vanish into
thin air true he had at length remained visible
along the entire route from prairie du chien to
milwaukee and he had covered in less than an hour
and a half this track of two hundred miles

  but since then there had been no news whatever
of the machine arrived at the end of the route
driven onward by its own impetus unable to stop
had it indeed been engulfed within the water of lake
michigan must we conclude that the machine and
its driver had both perished that there was no longer
any danger to be feared from either the great
majority of the public refused to accept this con-
clusion they fully expected the machine to
reappear

  mr ward frankly admitted that the whole matter
seemed to him most extraordinary and i shared his
view assuredly if this infernal chauffeur did not
return his apparition would have to be placed among
those superhuman mysteries which it is not given to
man to understand

  we had fully discussed this affair the chief and
i and i thought that our interview was at an end
when after pacing the room for a few moments he
said abruptly yes what happened there at mil-
waukee was very strange but here is something
no less so

  with this he handed me a report which he had
received from boston on a subject of which the eve-
ning papers had just begun to apprise their readers

while i read it mr ward was summoned from the
room i seated myself by the window and studied
with extreme attention the matter of the report

  for some days the waters along the coast of
maine massachusetts and connecticut had been the
scene of an appearance which no one could exactly
describe a moving body would appear amid the
waters some two or three miles off shore and go
through rapid evolutions it would flash for a while
back and forth among the waves and then dart out
of sight

  the body moved with such lightning speed that
the best telescopes could hardly follow it its length
did not seem to exceed thirty feet its cigar-shaped
form and greenish color made it difficult to dis-
tinguish against the background of the ocean it
had been most frequently observed along the coast
between cape cod and nova scotia from provi-
dence from boston from portsmouth and from
portland motor boats and steam launches had re-
peatedly attempted to approach this moving body
and even to give it chase they could not get any-
where near it

   pursuit seemed useless it darted like an arrow
beyond the range of view

   naturally widely differing opinions were held as
to the nature of this object but no hypothesis
rested on any secure basis seamen were as much
at a loss as others at first sailors thought it must
be some great fish like a whale but it is well
known that all these animals come to the surface
with a certain regularity to breathe and spout up
columns of mingled air and water now this strange
animal if it was an animal had never blown as
the whalers say nor had it ever made any noises
of breathing yet if it were not one of these huge
marine mammals how was this unknown monster
to be classed did it belong among the legendary
dwellers in the deep the krakens the octopuses the
leviathans the famous sea-serpents

   at any rate since this monster whatever it was
had appeared along the new england shores the
little fishing-smacks and pleasure boats dared not
venture forth wherever it appearedthe boats
fled to the nearest harbor as was but prudent if
the animal was of a ferocious character none cared
to await its attack

   as to the large ships and coast steamers they had
nothing to fear from any monster whale or other-
wise several of them had seen this creature at a
distance of some miles but when they attempted
to approach it fled rapidly away one day even
a fast united states gun boat went out from boston
if not to pursue the monster at least to send after
it a few cannon shot almost instantly the animal
disappeared and the attempt was vain as yet
however the monster had shown no intention of
attacking either boats or people

  at this moment mr ward returned and i inter-
rupted my reading to say there seems as yet no
reason to complain of this sea-serpent it flees
before big ships it does not pursue little ones
feeling and intelligence are not very strong in
fishes

   yet their emotions exist strock and if strongly
aroused-

   but mr ward the beast seems not at all dan-
gerous one of two things will happen either it
will presently quit these coasts or finally it will be


amazing stories

captured and we shall be able to study it at our leisure
here in the museum of washington

   and if it is not a marine animal asked mr
ward

   what else can it be i protested in surprise

   finish your reading said mr ward

   i did so and found that in the second part of the
report my chief had underlined some passages in
red pencil

   for some time no one had doubted that this was
an animal and that i f it were vigorously pursued it
would at last be driven from our shores but a
change of opinion had come about people began
to ask if instead of a fish this were not some new
and remarkable kind of boat

   certainly in that case its engine must be one of
amazing power perhaps the inventor befor selling
the secret of his invention sought to attract public
attention and to astound the maritime world such
surety in the movements of his boat grace in its
every evolution such ease in defying pursuit by its
arrow-like speed surely these were enough to arouse
world-wide curiosity

   at that time great progress had been made in the
manufacture of marine engines huge transatlantic
steamers completed the ocean passage in five days
and the engineers had not yet spoken their last word
neither were the navies of the world behindhand
the cruisers the torpedo boats the torpedo-destroy-
ers could match the swiftest steamers of the atlantic
and pacific or of the indian trade

   if however this were a boat of some new design
there had as yet been no opportunity to observe its
form as to the engines which drove it they must
be of a power far beyond the most efficient known
by what force they worked was equally a problem
since the boat had no sails it was not driven by the
wind and since it had no smoke-stack it was not
driven by steam

   at- this point in the report i again paused in my
reading and considered the comment i wished to
make

   what are you puzzling over strock demanded
my chief

   it is this mr ward the motive power of this
so-called boat must be as tremendous and as un-
known as that of the remarkable automobile which
has so amazed us all

   so that is your idea is it strock

  yes mr ward

   there was but one conclusion to be drawn if
the mysterious chauffeur had disappeared if he had
perished with his machine in lake michigan it was
equally important now to win the secret of this no
less mysterious navigator and it must be won
before he in his turn plunged into the abyss of the
ocean was it not the interest of the inventor to
disclose his invention would not the american
government or any other give him any price he chose
to ask

   yet unfortunately since the inventor of the ter-
restrial apparition had persisted in preserving his
incognito was it not to be feared that the inventor
of the marine apparition would equally preserve his
even if the first machine still existed it was no
longer heard from and would not the second in
the same way after having disclosed its powers dis-
appear in its turn without a single trace

   what gaye weight to this probability was that

since the arrival of this report at washington twenty-
four hours before the presence of the extraordinary
boat had not been announced from anywhere along
the shore neither had it been seen on any other
coast though of course the assertion that it
would not reappear at all would have been hazard-
ous to say the least

   i noted another interesting and possibly impor-
tant point it was a singular coincidence which in-
deed mr ward suggested to me at the same moment
that i was considering it this was that only after
the disappearance of the wonderful automobile had
the no less wonderful boat come into view more-
over their engines both possessed a most dangerous
power of locomotion if both should go rushing
at the same time over the face of the world the
same danger would threaten mankind everywhere
in boats in vehicles and on foot therefore it was
absolutely necessary that the police should in some
manner interfere to protect the public ways of travel

   that is what mr ward pointed out to me and
our duty was obvious but how could we accomplish
this task we discussed the matter for some time
and i was just about to leave when mr ward made
one last suggestion

   have you not observed strock said he that
there is a sort of fantastic resemblance between
the general appearance of this boat and this auto-
mobile 

   there is something of the sort mr ward

   well is it not possible that the two are one

          chapter vi
          the first letter

after leaving mr ward i returned to my
home in long street there i had plenty
 of time to consider this strange case unin-
terrupted by either wife or children my household
consisted solely of an ancient servant who having
been formerly in the service of my mother had now
continued for fifteen years in mine

   two months before i had obtained a leave of
absence it had still two weeks to run unless indeed
some unforeseen circumstance interrupted it some
mission which could not be delayed this leave as
i have shown had already been interrupted for four
days by my exploration of the great eyrie

 and now was it not my duty to abandon my vaca-
tion and endeavor to throw light upon the remark-
able events of which the road to milwaukee and the
shore of new england had been in turn the scene

i would have given much to solve the twin mysteries
but how was it possibleto follow the track of this
automobile or this boat

 seated in my easy chair after breakfast with my
pipe lighted i opened my newspaper to what
should i turn politics interested me but little with
its eternal strife between the republicans and the
democrats neither did i care for the news of
society nor for the sporting page you will not be
surprised then that my first idea was to see if there
was any news from north carolina about the great
eyrie there was little hope of this however for
mr smith had promised to telegraph me at once
if anything occurred i felt quite sure that the
mayor of morganton was as eager for information
and as watchful as i could have been myself the
the master of the world

paper told me nothing- new it dropped idly from
my hand and i remained deep in thought

   what most frequently recurred to me was the
 suggestion of mr ward that perhaps the automo-
 bile and the boat which had attracted our attention
 were in reality one and the same very probably
 at least the two machines had been built by the
 same hand and beyond doubt these were similar
 engines which generated this remarkable speed more
 than doubling the previous records of earth and sea
 the same inventor repeated i

   evidently this hypothesis had strong grounds the
 fact that the two machines had not yet appeared at
 the same time added weight to the idea i mur-
 mured to myself after the mystery of great
 eyrie comes that of milwaukee and boston will
 this new problem be as difficult to solve afc was the
 other	

   i noted idly that this new affair had a general
 resemblance to the other since both menaced the
 security of the general public to be sure only the
 inhabitants of the blue ridge region had been in
 danger from an eruption or possible earthquake at
 great eyrie while now on every road of the
 united states or along every league of its coasts
 and harbors every inhabitant was in danger from
 this vehicle or this boat with its sudden appearance
 and insane speed

   i found that as was to be expected the news-
 papers not only suggested but enlarged upon the
 dangers of the case timid people everywhere were
 much alarmed my old servant naturally credulous
 and superstitious was particularly upset that same
 day after dinner as she was clearing away the things
 she stopped before me a water bottle in one hand
 the napkin in the other and asked anxiously is
 there no news sir

   none i answered knowing well to what she
 referred

   the automobile has not come back

   no

   nor the boat

   nor the boat there is no news even in the
 best informed papers

   but-your secret police information

   we are no wiser

   then sir if you please of what use are the
 police 

   it is a question which has phased me more than
 once

   now you see what will happen continued the
 old housekeeper complainingly some fine morning
 he will come without warning this terrible chauffeur
 and rush down our street here and kill us all

   good when that happens there will be some
 chance of catching him

   he will never be arrested sir

  why not

   because he is the devil himself and you cant
 arrest the devil

   decidedly thought i the devil has many uses
 and if he did not exist we would have to invent him
 to give people some way of explaining the inexplic-
 able it was he who lit the flames of the great eyrie

 it was he who smashed the record in the wisconsin
 race it is he who is scurrying along the shores
 of connecticut and massachusetts but putting tc
 one side this evil spirit who is so necessary for the
 convenience of the ignorant there was no doubt that



 we were facing a most bewildering problem had
 both of these machines disappeared forever they
 had passed like a meteor like a star shooting through
 space and in a hundred years the adventure would
 become a legend much to the taste of the gossips of
 the next century

   for several days the newspapers of america and
 even those of europe continued to discuss these
 events editorials crowded upon editorials rumors
 were added to rumors story tellers of every kind
 crowded to the front the public of two continents
 was interested in some parts of europe there was
 even jealousy that america should have been chosen
 as the field of such an experience if these marvelous
 inventors were american then their country their
 army and navy would have a great advantage over
 others the united states might acquire an incon-
 testible superiority

   under the date of the tenth of june a new york
 paper published a carefully studied article on this
 phase of the subject comparing the speed of the
 swiftest known vessels with the smallest minimum
 of speed which could possibly be assigned to the
 new boat the article demonstrated that if the united
 states secured this secret europe would be but three
 days away from her while she would still be five
 days from europe

    if our own police had searched diligently to dis-
  cover the mystery of the great eyrie the secret serv-
  ice of every country in the world was now interested
  in these new problems

   mr ward referred to the matter each time i saw
 him our chat would begin by his rallying me about
 my ill-success in carolina and i would respond by
 reminding him that success there was only a ques-
 tion of expense

   never mind my good strock said he there
 will come a chance for our clever inspector to regain
 his laurels take now this affair of the automobile
 and the boat if you could clear that up in advance
 of all the detectives of the world what an honor it
 would be to our department what glory for you 

   it certainly would mr ward and if you put
 the matter in my charge-

   who knows strock let us wait awhile let
 us wait

   matters stood thus when on the morning of june
 fifteenth my old servant brought me a letter from
 the letter-carrier a registered letter for which i had
 to sign i looked at the address i did not know
 the handwriting the postmark dating from two
 days before was stamped at the post-office of mor-
 ganton

   morganton here at last was no doubt news
 from mr elias smith

   yes exclaimed t speaking to my old servant
 for lack of another it must be from mr smith at
 last i know no one else in morganton and if he
 writes he has news

    morganton  said the old woman isnt that the
  place where the demons set fire to their mountain

    exactly

   oh sir i hope you dont mean to go back

	there

   wrhy not

    because you will end by being burned up in that
  furnace of the great eyrie and i wouldnt want
  you buried that way sir


amazing stories

  cheer up and let us see if it is not better news
  than that

 the envelope was sealed with red sealing wax
 and stamped with a sort of coat-of-arms surmounted
 with three stars the paper was thick and very-
 strong i broke the envelope and drew out a letter
 it was a single sheet folded in four and written 
 one side only my first glance was for the signature

 there was no signature nothing but three initials
 at the end of the last line

 the letter is not from the mayor of morganton
 said i

 then from whom asked the old servant doubly
 curious in her quality as a woman and as an old
 gossip

 looking again at the three initials of the signature

 i said i know no one for whom these letters would
 stand neither at morganton nor elsewhere 

 the handwriting was bold both up strokes and
 down strokes very sharp about twenty lines in all
 here is the letter of which i with good reason re-
 tained an exact copy it was dated to my extreme
 stupefaction from that mysterious great eyrie

                 great eyrie blue ridge mtns
                 north carolina june th

 to mr strock

     chief inspector of police

      long st washington d c

 sir

 you were charged with the mission of penetrat-
 ing the great eyrie

 you came on april the twenty-eighth accom-
 panied by the mayor of morganton and two guides

 you mounted to the foot of the wall and you
 encircled it finding it too high and steep to climb

 you sought a breech and you found none

 know this none enter the great eyrie or if one
 enters he never returns

 do not try again for the second attempt will not
 result as did the first but will have grave conse-
 quences for you

     heed this warning or evil fortune will come to
 you	m o w

             chapter vii
            a third machine

 i confess that at first this letter dumbfounded
 me ohs and ahs slipped from my open
 mouth the old servant stared at me not know-
 ing what to think

     oh sir is it bad news 

    i answered-for i kept few secrets from this
 faithful soul-by reading her the letter from end to
 end she listened with much anxiety

    a joke without doubt said i shrugging my
 shoulders

     well returned my superstitious handmaid if
 it isnt from the devil its from the devils country
 anyway

     left alone i again went over this unexpected let-
 ter reflection inclined me yet more strongly to be-
 lieve that it was the work of a practical joker my
 adventure was well known the newspapers had
 given it in full detail some satirist such as exists
 even in america must have written this threatening
 letter to mock me

     to assume on the other hand that the eyrie really

served as the refuge of a band of criminals seemed
absurd if they feared that the police would dis-
cover their retreat surely they would not have been
so foolish as thus to force attention upon themselves
their chief security would lie in keeping their pres-
ence there unknown they must have realized that
such a challenge from them would only arouse the
police to renewed activity dynamite or melinite
would soon open an entrance to their fortress more-
over how could these men have themselves gained
entrance into the eyrie-unless there existed a pas-
sage which we had failed to discover assuredly the
letter came from a jester or a madman and i need
not worry over it nor even consider it

   hence though for an instant i had thought of
showing this letter to mr ward i decided not to do
so surely he would attach no importance to it
however i did not destroy it but locked it in my
desk for safekeeping if more letters came of the
same kind and with the same initials i would attach
as little weight to them as to this

   several days passed quietly there was nothing
to lead me to expect that i would soon quit wash-
ington  though in my line of duty one is never cer-
tain of the morrow at any moment i might be
speeding from oregon to florida from maine to
texas and-this unpleasant thought haunted me
frequently-if my next mission were no more suc-
cessful than that to the great eyrie i might as well
give up and hand in my resignation from the force
of the mysterious chauffeur or chauffeurs nothing
more was heard i knew that our own government
agents as well as foreign ones were keeping keen
watch over all the roads and rivers all the lakes and
the coasts of america of course the size of the
country made any close supervision impossible but
these twin inventors had not before chosen secluded
and unfrequented spots in which to appear the
main highway of wisconsin on a great race day the
harbor of boston incessantly crossed by thousands
of boats these were hardly what would be called hid-
ing places if the daring driver had not perished-
of which there was always strong probability then
he must have left america perhaps he was in the
waters of the old world or else resting in some
retreat known only to himself and in that case-

   ah i repeated to myself many times for such
a retreat as secret as inaccessible this fantastic per-
sonage could not find one better than the great
eyrie but of course a boat could not get there
any more than an automobile only high-flying birds
of prey eagles or condors could find refuge there

   the nineteenth of june i was going to the police
bureau when on leaving my house i noticed two
men who looked at me with a certain keenness not
knowing them i took no notice and if my attention
was drawn to the matter it was because my servant
spoke of it when i returned

   for some days she said she had noticed that two
men seemed to be spying upon me in the street they
stood constantly perhaps a hundred steps from my
house and she suspected that they followed me each
time i avent up the street

   you are sure i asked

   yes sir and no longer ago than yesterday when
you came into the house these men came slipping
along in your footsteps and then went away as soon
as the door was shut behind you

   you must be mistaken
the master of the world



   but i tell you i am not mistaken sir

   and if you met these two men you would know
them

   i would

   good i cried laughing i see you have the very
spirit of a detective i must engage you as a member
of our force

   joke if you like sir but i have still two good
eyes and i dont need spectacles to recognize people
someone is spying on you thats certain and you
should put some of your men to track them in turn
all right i promise to do so i said to satisfy
her and when my men get after them we shall
soon know what these mysterious fellows want of
me

   in truth i did not take the good souls excited an-
nouncement very seriously i added howeven
when i go out i will watch the people around md
with great care

   that will be best sir

   my poor old housekeeper was always frightening
herself at nothing if i see them again she added
i will warn you before you set foot out of doors
agreed and i broke off the conversation
knowing well that if i allowed her to run on she
would end by being sure that beelzebub himself and
one of his chief attendants were at my heels

   the two following days there was certainly no
one spying on me either at my exits or entrances
so i concluded that my old servant had made much
of nothing as usual but on the morning of the
twenty-second of june after rushing upstairs as
rapidly as her age would permit the devoted old soul
burst into my room and in a half whisper gasped
sir sir

   what is it

   they are there

   who i queried my mind on anything but the
web she had been spinning about me

   the two spies

   ah those wonderful spies

   themselves -in the street-right in front of
our windows-watching the house waiting for you
to go out

   i went to the window and raising just an edge of
the shade so as not to give any warning i saw two
men on the pavement

   they were rather fine-looking men broad-shoul-
dered and vigorous aged somewhat under forty
dressed in the ordinary fashion of the day with
slouched hats heavy woolen suits stout walking
shoes and sticks in hand undoubtedly they were
staring persistently at my apparently unwatchful
house then having exchanged a few words they
strolled off a little way and returned again

   are you sure these are the same men you saw
before

   yes sir

   evidently i could no longer dismiss her warning
as an hallucination and i promised myself to clear
up the matter as to following the men myself i
was presumably too well known to them to address
them directly would probably be of no use but
that very day one of our best men should be put
on watch and if the spies returned on the morrow
they should be tracked in their turn and watched
until their identity was established

   at the moment they were waiting to follow me
to police headquarters for it was there that i was

bound as usual if they accompanied me i might be
able to offer them a hospitality for which they would
scarce thank me

  i took my hat and while the housekeeper re-
mained peeping from the window i went down-
stairs opened the door and stepped into the street

  the two men were no longer there

  despite all my watchfulness that day i saw no
more of them as i passed along the streets from
that time on indeed neither my old servant nor i
saw them again before the house nor did i encoun-
ter them elsewhere their appearance however was
stamped upon my memory i would not forget them

  perhaps after all admitting that i had been the
object of their espionage they had been mistaken in
my identity having obtained a good look at me
they now followed me no more so in the end i
came to regard this matter as of no more importance
than the letter with the initials m o w

  then on the twenty-fourth of june there came a
new event to further stimulate both my interest and
that of the general public in the previous mysteries
of the automobile and the boat the washington
evening star published the following account which
was next morning copied by every paper in the
country

  lake kirdall in kansas forty miles west of to-
peka is little known it deserves wider knowledge
and doubtless will have it hereafter for attention is
now drawn to it in a very remarkable way

  this lake dee among the mountains appears to
have no outlet what it loses in evaporation it re-
gains from the little neighboring streamlets and the
heavy rains

  lake kirdall covers about seventy-five square
miles and its level is but slightly below that of the
heights which surround it shut in among the moun-
tains it can be reached only by narrow and rocky
gorges several villages however have sprung up
upon its banks it is full of fish and fishing-boats
cover its waters

  lake kirdall is in many places fifty feet deep
close to shore sharp pointed rocks form the edges
of this huge basin its surges roused by high-winds
beat upon its banks with fury and the houses near
at hand are often deluged with spray as if with the
downpour of a hurricane the lake already deep at
the edge becomes yet deeper toward the center
where in some places soundings show over three
hundred feet of water

  the fishing industry supports a population of
several thousands and there are several hundred fish-
ing boats in addition to the dozen or so of little
steamers which serve the traffic of the lake beyond
the circle of the mountains lie the railroads which
transport the products of the fishing industry
throughout kansas and the neighboring states

  this account of lake kirdall is necessary for the
understanding of the remarkable facts which we are
about to report

  and this is what the evening star then reported
in its startling article for some time past the
fishermen have noticed a strange upheaval in the
waters of the lake sometimes it rises as if a wave
surged up from its depths even in perfectly calm
weather when there is no wind whatever this up-
heaval sometimes arises in a mass of foam

  tossed about by violent waves of unaccountable
currents boats have been swept beyond all control


amazing stories

sometimes they have been dashed one against an-
other and serious damage has resulted

   this confusion of the waters evidently has its
origin somewhere in the depths of the lake and vari-
ous explanations have been offered to account for it
at first it was suggested that the trouble was due to
seismic forces to some volcanic action beneath the
fake but this hypothesis had to be rejected when it
was recognized that the disturbance was not confined
lo one locality but spread itself over the entire sur-
face of the lake either at one part or another in the
center or along the edges traveling along almost in a
regular line and in a way to exclude entirely all idea
of earthquake or volcanic action

 another hypothesis suggested that it was a ma-
rine monster who thus upheaved the waters but
unless the beast had been born in the lake anvl had
ithere grown to its gigantic proportions unsuspected
which was scarcely possible he must have come there
irom outside lake kirdall however has no con-
nection with any other waters if this lake were
situated near any of the oceans there might be sub-
terranean canals but in the center of america and
at the height of some thousands of feet above sca-
jevel this is not possible in short here is another
riddle not easy to solve and it is much easier to point
out the impossibility of false explanations than to
discover the true ones

   is it possible that the submarine boat is being
experimented with beneath the lake such boats
are no longer impossible today some years ago at
bridgeport connecticut there was launched a boat
the protector which could go on the water under
the water and also upon land built by an inventor
named lake supplied with two motors an electric
one of seventy-five horsepower and a gasoline one
of two hundred and fifty horsepower it was also
provided with wheels a yard in diameter which en-
abled it to roll over the roads as well as swim the
seas

   but even then granting that the turmoil of lake
kirdall might be produced by a submarine brought
to a high degree of perfection there remains as be-
fore the question how could it have reached lake
kirdall  the lake shut in on all sides by a circle of
mountains is no more accessible to a submarine than
to a sea-monster

   in whatever way this last puzzling question may
be solved the nature of this strange appearance can
no longer be disputed since the twentieth of june
on that day in the afternoon the schooner market
while speeding with all sails set came into violent
collision with something just below the water level
there was no shoal nor rock near for the lake in
this part is eighty or ninety feet deep the schooner
with both her bow and her side badly broken was
in great danger of sinking she managed however
to reach the shore before her decks were completely
submerged

  when the mark el had been pumped out and
hauled up on shore an examination showed that she
had received a blow near the bow as if from a
powerful ram

   from this it seems evident that there is actually
a submarine boat which darts about beneath the sur-
face of lake kirdall with most remarkable rapidity

   the thing is difficult to explain not only is
there a question as to how did the submarine get
there but why is it there why does it never

come to the surface what reason has its owner for
remaining unknown are other disasters to be ex-
pected from its reckless course

   the article in the evening star closed with this
truly striking suggestion after the mysterious au-
tomobile came the mysterious boat now comes the
mysterious submarine

   must we conclude that the three engines are due
to the genius of the same inventor and that the three
vehicles are in truth but one

           chapter vtii
           at any cost

the suggestion of the star came like a revela-
tion it was accepted everywhere not only
were these three vehicles the work of the same
inventor they were the same machine

   it was not easy to see how the remarkable trans-
formation could be practically accomplished from
one means of locomotion to the other how could
an automobile become a boat and yet more a suit-
marine all the machine seemed to lack was the
power of flying through the air nevertheless every-
thing that was known of the three different machines
as to their size their shape their lack of odor or of
steam and above all their remarkable speed seemed
to imply their identity the public grown blase with
so many excitements found in this new marvel a
stimulus to reawaken their curiosity

  the newspapers dwelt now chiefly on the impor-
tance of the invention this new engine whether in
one vehicle or three had given proofs of its power
what amazing proofs the invention must be
bought at any-price the united states government
must purchase it at once for the use of the nation
assuredly the great european powers would stop at
nothing to be beforehand with america and gain
possession of an engine so invaluable for military
and naval use what incalculable advantages would
it give to any nation both on land and sea its de-
structive powers could not even be estimated until
its qualities and limitations were better known no
amount of money would be too great ta pay for the
secret america could not put her millions to better
use

   but to buy the machine it was necessary to find
the inventor and there the chief difficulty seemed to
be in vain was lake kirdall searched from end to
end even its depths were explored with a sound-
ing-line without results must it be concluded that
the submarine no longer lurked beneath its waters
but in that case how had the boat gotten away for
that matter how had it come an insoluble
problem

  the submarine was heard from no more neither
in lake kirdall nor elsewhere it had disappeared
like the automobile from the roads and like the boat
from the shores of america several times in my
interviews with mr ward we discussed this matter
which still filled his mind our men continued every-
where on the lookout but as unsuccessfully as other
agents

   on the morning of the twenty-seventh of june i
was summoned into the presence of mr ward

   well strock said he here is a splendid chance
for you to get your revenge

   revenge for the great eyrie disappointment

   of course
the master of the world



  what chance asked i not knowing if he spoke
seriously or in jest

  why here he answered would not you like
to discover the inventor of this three-fold machine
i certainly should mr ward give me the order
to take charge of the matter and i will accomplish
the impossible in order to succeed it is true i be-
lieve it will be difficult

  undoubtedly strock perhaps even more diffi-
cult than to penetrate into the great eyrie

  it was evident that mr ward was intent on rally-
ing me about my unsuccess he would not do that
i felt assured out of mere unkindness perhaps then
he meant to rouse my resolution he knew me well
and realized that i would have given anything in the
world to recoup my defeat i waited quietly for new
instructions	v

  mr ward dropped his jesting and said to me very
generously i know strock that you accomplished
everything that depended on human powers and
that no blame attaches to you but we face now a
matter very different from that of the great eyrie
the day the government decides to force that sec-
ret everything is ready we have only to spend
some thousands of dollars and the road will be
open

  that is what i would urge

  but at present said mr ward shaking his head
it is much more important to place our hands on
this fantastic inventor who so constantly escapes us
that is work for a detective indeed a master de-
tective 

  he has not been heard from again

  no and though there is every reason to believe
that he has been and still continues beneath the
waters of lake kirdall it has been impossible to
find any trace of him anywhere around there one
would almost fancy he had the power of making
himself invisible this proteus of a mechanic

  it seems likely said i that he will never be
seen until he wishes to be

  true strock and to my mind there is only one
way of dealing with him and that is to offer him
such an enormous price that he cannot refuse to sell
his invention

  mr ward was right indeed the government had
already made the effort to secure speech with this
hero of the day and surely no human being has ever
better merited the title the press had widely spread
the news and this extraordinary individual must as-
suredly know what the government desired of him
and how completely he could name the terms he
wished

  surely added mr ward this invention can be
of no personal use to the man that he should hide
it from the rest of us there is every reason why
he should sell it can this unknown be already some
dangerous criminal who thanks to his machine
hopes to defy all pursuit

  my chief then went on to explain that it had been
decided to employ other means jn search of the in-
ventor it was possible after all that he had per-
ished with his machine in some dangerous maneuver
if so the ruined vehicle might prove almost as valu-
able and instructive to the mechanical world as the
man himself but since the accident to the schooner
markel on lake kirdall no news of him whatever
had reached the police

  on this point mr ward did not attempt to hide

his disappointment and his anxiety anxiety yes
for it was manifestly becoming more and more diffi-
cult for him to fulfill his duty of protecting the pub-
lic how could we arrest criminals if they could
flee from justice at such speed over both land and
sea how could we pursue them under the oceans
and when dirigible balloons should also have reached
their full perfection we would even have to chase
men through the air i asked myself if my col-
leagues and i would not find ourselves some day re-
duced to utter helplessness if police officials be-
come a useless incumbrance would be definitely dis-
carded by society 

   here there recurred to me the jesting letter i had
received a fortnight before the letter which threat-
ened my liberty and even my life i recalled also
the singular espionage of which i had been the sub-
ject i asked myself if i had better mention these
things to mr ward but they seemed to have abso-
lutely no relation to the matter now in hand the
great eyrie affair had been definitely put aside by
the government since an eruption was no longer
threatening and they now wished to employ me
upon this newer matter i waited then to mention
this letter to my chief at some future time when it
would be not so sore a joke to me

  mr ward again took up our conversation we
are resolved by some means to establish communi-
cation with this inventor he has disappeared it is
true but he may reappear at any moment and in
any part of the country i have chosen you strock
to follow him the instant he appears you must hold
yourself ready to leave washington on the moment
do not quit your house except to come here to head-
quarters each day notify me each time by tele-
phone when you start from home and report to me
personally the moment you arrive here

  i will follow orders exactly mr ward i an-
swered but permit me one question ought i to
act alone or will it not be better to join with me-
that is what i intend said the chief interrupt-
ing me you are to choose two of our men whom
you think the best fitted

  i will do so mr ward and now if some day
or other i stand in the presence of our man what am
i to do with him 

  above all things do not lose sight of him if
there is no other way arrest him you shall have a
warrant	

  a useful precaution mr ward if he started
to jump into his automobile and to speed away at
the rate we know of i must stop him at any cost
one cannot argue long with a man making two hun-
dred miles an hour

  you must prevent that strock and the arrest
made telegraph me after that the matter will be
in my hands

  count on me mr ward at any hour day or
night i shall be ready to start with my men i thank-
you for having entrusted this mission to me if it
succeeds it will be a great honor-

  and of great profit added my chief dismissing
me

  returning home i made all preparations for a
trip of indefinite duration perhaps my good house-
keeper imagined that i planned a return to the great
eyrie which she regarded as an ante-chamber of
hell itself she said nothing but went about her
work with a most despairing face nevertheless


amazing stories

sure as i was of her discretion i told her nothing
in this great mission i would confide in no one

  my choice of the two men to accompany me was
easily made they both belonged to my own depart-
ment and had many times under my direct command
given proofs of their vigor courage and intelligence
one john hart of illinois was a man of thirty
years the other aged thirty-two was nab walker
of massachusetts i could not have had better
assistants

  several days passed without news either of the
automobile the boat or the submarine there were
rumors in plenty but the police knew them to be
false as to the reckless stories that appeared in
the newspapers they had most of them no founda-
tion whatever even the best journals cannot be
trusted to refuse an exciting bit of newa on the
mere ground of its unreliability

  then twice in quick succession there came what
seemed trustworthy reports of the man of the
hour the first asserted that he had been seen on the
roads of arkansas near little rock the second
that he was in the very middle of lake superior

  unfortunately these two notices were absolutely
unreconcilable for while the first gave the afternoon
of june twenty-sixth as the time of appearance the
second set it for the evening of the same day now
these two points of the united states territory are
not less than eight hundred miles apart even grant-
ing the automobile this unthinkable speed greater
than any it had yet shown how could it have crossed
all the intervening country unseen how could it
traverse the states of arkansas missouri iowa and
wisconsin from end to end without any one of our
agents giving us warning without any interested
person rushing to a telephone

  after these two momentary appearances if ap-
pearances they were the machine again dropped out
of knowledge mr ward did not think it worth
while to dispatch me and my men to either point
whence it had been reported

  yet since this marvelous machine seemed still in
existence something must be done the following
official notice was published in every newspaper of
the united states under july d it was couched in
the most formal terms

  during the month of april of the present year
an automobile traversed the roads of pennsylvania
of kentucky of ohio of tennessee of missouri of
illinois and on the twenty-seventh of may during
the race held by the american automobile club it
covered the course in wisconsin then it disap-
peared

  during the first week of june a boat maneuver-
ing at great speed appeared off the coast of new
england between cape cod and cape sable and
more particularly around boston then it disap-
peared

  in the second fortnight of the same month a sub-
marine boat was run beneath the waters of lake
kirdall in kansas then it disappeared

  everything points to the belief that the same in-
ventor must have built these three machines or per-
haps that they are the same machine constructed so
as to travel both on land and water

  a proposition is therefore addressed to the said
inventor whoever he be with the aim of acquiring
the said machine

  he is requested to make himself known and to

name the terms upon which he will treat with the
united states government he is also requested to
answer as promptly as possible to the department of
federal police washington d c united states of
america

  such was the notice printed in large type on the
front page of every newspaper surely it could not
fail to reach the eye of him for whom it was in-
tended wherever he might be he would read it
he could scarce fail to answer it in some manner
and why should he refuse such an unlimited offer
we had only to await his reply

  one can easily imagine how high the public curi-
osity rose from morning till night an eager and
noisy crowd pressed about the bureau of police
awaiting the arrival of a letter or a telegram the
best reporters were on the spot what honor what
profit would come to the paper which was first to
publish the famous news to know at last the name
and place of the undiscoverable unknown and to
know if he would agree to some bargain with the
government it goes without saying that america
does things on a magnificent scale millions would
not be lacking for the inventor if necessary all
the millionaires in the country would open their in-
exhaustible purses

  the day passed to how many excited and im-
patient people it seemed to contain more than twenty-
four hours and each hour held far more than
sixty minutes there came no answer no letter no
telegram the night following there was still no
news and it was the same the next day-and the
next

  there came however another result which had
been fully foreseen the cables informed europe
of what the united states government had done
the different powers of the old world hoped also
to obtain possession of the wonderful invention
why should they not struggle for an advantage so
tremendous why should they not enter the con-
test with their millions 

  in brief every great power took part in the affair
france england russia italy austria germany
only the states of the second order refrained from
entering with their smaller resources upon a useless
effort the european press published notices identi-
cal with that of the united states the extraordi-
nary chauffeur had only to speak to become a
rival to the vanderbilts the astors the goulds the
morgans and the rothschilds of every country of
europe

  and when the mysterious inventor made no sign
what attractive offers were held forth to tempt him
to discard the secrecy in which he was enwrapped
the whole world became a public market an auction
house whence arose the most amazing bids twice a
day the newspapers would add up the amounts and
these kept rising from millions to millions the end
came when the united states congress after a
memorable session voted to offer the sum of twenty
million dollars and there was not a citizen of the
states of whatever rank who objected to the
amount so much importance was attached to the
possession of this prodigious engine of locomotion
as for me i said emphatically to my old house-
keeper  the machine is worth even more than that

  evidently the other nations of the world did not
think so for their bids remained below the final sum
but how useless was this mighty struggle of the
the master of the world



great rivals the inventor did not appear he did
not exist he had never existed it was all a
monstrous pretense of the american newspapers
that at least became the announced view of the
old world

   and so the time passed there was no further
news of our man there was no response from him
he appeared no more for my part not knowing
what to think i commenced to lose all hope of reach-
ing any solution to the strange affair

   then on the morning of the fifteenth of july a
letter without postmark was found in the mailbox
of the police bureau after the authorities had
studied it it was given out to the washington jour-
nals which published it in facsimile in special num-
bers it was couched as follows	v



chapter ix
the second letter

onboard the terror

july 

unpo tie anl new world

the propositions emanating from the
jl different governments of europe as also
that which has finally been made by the united
states of america need expect no other answer than
this

   i refuse absolutely and definitely the sums of-
fered for my invention

   my machine will be neither french nor german
nor austrian nor russian nor english nor ameri-
can

   the invention will remain my own and i shall
use it as pleases me

   with it i hold control of the entire world and
there lies no force within the reach of humanity
which is able to resist me under any circumstances
whatsoever

   let no one attempt to seize or stop me it is
and will be utterly impossible whatever injury
anyone attempts against me i will return a hundred-
fold

   as to the money which is offered me i despise
it i have no need of it moreover on the day
when it pleases me to have millions or billions i
have but to reach out my hand and take them

  let both the old and the new world realize
this they can accomplish nothing against me i can
accomplish anything against them

   so i sign this letter

the master of the world

chapter x
outside the law

such was the letter addressed to the govern-
ment of the united states as to the person
who had placed it in the police mailbox no one
had seen him

i the sidewalk in front of our offices had probably
not been once vacant during the entire night from
sunset to sunrise there had always been people busy
anxious or curious passing before our door it is
true however that even then the bearer of the let-
ter might easily have slipped by unseen and dropped
the letter in the box the night had been so dark
you could scarcely see from one side of the street
to the other

   i have said that this letter appeared in facsimile in

	all the newspapers to which the government com-
municated it perhaps one would naturally imagine
that the first comment of the public would be this
is the work of some practical joker it was in that
way that i had accepted my letter from the great
eyrie five weeks before

   but this was not the general attitude toward the
present letter neither in washington nor in the rest
of america to the few who would have maintained
that the document should not be taken seriously an
immense majority would have responded this let-
ter has not the style nor the spirit of a jester only
one man could have written it and that is the inven-
tor of this unapproachable machine

   to most people this conclusion seemed indisput-
able owing to a curious state of mind easily explain-
able for all the strange facts of which the key had
hitherto been lacking this letter furnished an expla-
nation the theory now almost universally accepted
was as follows the inventor had hidden himself for
a time only in order to reappear more startlingly in
some new light instead of having perished in an
accident he had concealed himself in some retreat
where the police were unable to discover him then
to assert positively his attitude toward all govern-
ments he had written this letter but instead of
dropping it in the post in any one locality which
might have resulted in its being traced to him he
had come to washington and deposited it himself in
the very spot suggested by the governments official
notice the bureau of police

   well if this remarkable personage had reckoned
that this new proof of his existence would make
some noise in two worlds he certainly figured
rightly that day the millions of good folk who
read and re-read their daily paper could-to employ
a well-known phrase-scarcely believe their eyes

   as for myself i studied carefully every phase of
the defiant document the handwriting was black
and heavy an expert at chirography would doubt-
less have distinguished in the lines traces of a violent
temperament of a character stern and unsocial
suddenly a cry escaped me-a cry that fortunately
my housekeeper did not hear why had i not no-
ticed sooner the resemblance of the handwriting to
lhat of the letter i had received from morganton

   moreover a yet more significant coincidence the
initials with which my letter had been signed did
they not stand for the words master of the
world

  and whence came the second letter on board
the terror  doubtless this name was that of the
triple machine commanded by the mysterious cap-
tain the initials in my letter were his own signa-
ture and it was he who had threatened me if i
dared to renew my attempt on the great eyrie

   i rose and took from my desk the letter of june
thirteenth i compared it with the facsimile in the
newspapers there was no doubt about it they
were both in the same peculiar handwriting

  my mind worked eagerly i sought to trace the
probable deductions from this striking fact known
only to myself the man who had threatened me
was the commander of this terror-startling
name only too well justified i asked myself if our
search could not now be prosecuted under less vague
conditions could we not now start our men upon a
trail which would lead definitely to success in short


amazing stories

 what relation existed between the terror and the
 great eyrie what connection was there between
 the phenomena of the blue ridge mountains and
 the no less phenomenal performances of the fantastic
 machine

 i knew what my first step would be and with the
 letter in my pocket i hastened to police headquar-
 ters inquiring if mr ward was within and receiv-
 ing an affirmative reply i hastened toward his door
 and rapped upon it with unusual and perhaps un-
 necessary vigor upon his call to enter i stepped
 eagerly into the room

 the chief had spread before him the letter pub-
 lished in the papers not a facsimile but the original
 itself which had been deposited in the letter-box of
 the department	

 you come as if you had important news
 strock

 judge for yourself mr ward and i drew from
 my pocket the letter with the initials

 mr ward took it glanced at its face and asked
 what is this

 a letter signed only with initials as you can see
 and where was it posted

 in morganton in north carolina

 when did you receive it 

 a month ago the thirteenth of june

 what did you think of it then 

 that it had been written as a joke

 and-now-strock 

 i think what you will think mr ward after
 you have studied it

 my chief turned to the letter again and read it
 carefully it is signed with three initials said he

 yes mr ward and those initials belong to the
 words master of the world in this facsimile
 of which this is the original responded mr
 ward taking it up

 it is quite evident i urged that the two letters
 are by the same hand

 it seems so

 you see what threats are made against me to
 protect the great eyrie

 yes the threat of death but strock you have
 had this letter for a month why have you not
 shown it to me before

 because i attached no importance to it today
 after the letter from the terror it must be taken
 seriously

 i agree with you it appears to me most impor-
 tant i even hope it may prove the means of track-
 ing this strange personage

 that is what i also hope mr ward

 only-what connection can possibly exist be-
 tween the terror and the great eyrie

 that i do not know i cannot even imagine-
 there can be but one explanation continued
 mr ward though it is almost inadmissible even
 impossible

 and that is

 that the great eyrie was the spot selected by the
 inventor where he gathered his material

 that is impossible cried i in what way
 would he get his material in there and how get his
 machine out after what i have seen mr ward
 your suggestion is impossible

 unless strock-

 unless what i demanded

 unless the machine of this master of the world

has also wings which permit it to take refuge in the
great eyrie

  at the suggestion that the terror which had
searched the deeps of the sea might be capable also
of rivaling the vultures and the eagles i could not
restrain an expressive shrug of incredulity neither
did mr ward himself dwell upon the extravagant
hypothesis

  he took the two letters and compared them
afresh he examined them under a microscope
especially the signatures and established their per-
fect identity not only the same hand but the same
pen had written them

  after some moments of further reflection mr
ward said i will keep your letter strock de-
cidedly i think that you are fated to play an im-
portant part in this strange affair-or rather in these
two affairs what thread attaches them i cannot
yet see but i am sure the thread exists you have
been connected with the first and it will not be sur-
prising if you have a large part in the second

  i hope so mr ward you know how inquisitive
i am

  i do strock that is understood now i can
only repeat my former order hold yourself in readi-
ness to leave washington at a moments warning

  all that day the public excitement caused by the
defiant letter mounted steadily higher it was felt
both at the white house and at the capitol that
public opinion absolutely demanded some action of
course it was difficult to do anything where could
one find this master of the world and even if he
were discovered how could he be captured he had
at his disposal not only the powers he had displayed
but apparently still greater resources as yet unknown
how had he been able to reach lake kirdall over
the rocks and how had he escaped from it then
if he had indeed appeared on lake superior how
had he covered all the intervening territory unseen 

  what a bewildering affair it was altogether this
of course made it all the more important to get to
the bottom of it since the millions of dollars had
been refused force must be employed- the inventor
and his invention were not to be bought and in
what haughty and menacing terms he had couched
his refusal so lie it he must be treated as an
enemy of society against whom all means became
justified that he might be deprived of his power to
injure others the idea that he had perished was
now entirely discarded he was alive very much
alive and his existence constituted a perpetual pub-
lic danger

  influenced by these ideas the government issued
the following proclamation

  since the commander of the terror has refused
to make public his invention at any price whatever
since the use which he makes of his machine con-
stitutes a public menace against which it is impos-
sible to guard the said commander of the terror is
hereby placed beyond the protection of the law any
measures taken in the effort to capture or destroy
either him or his machine will be approved and re-
warded

  it was a declaration of war war to the death
against this master of the world who thought to
threaten and defy an entire nation the american
nation

  before the day was over various rewards of large
amounts were promised to anyone who revealed the
the master of the world



hiding place of this dangerous inventor to anyone
who could identify him and to anyone who should
rid the country of him

  such was the situation during the last fortnight of
july all was left to the hazard of fortune the
moment the outlaw re-appeared he would be seen
and signaled and when the chance came he would be
arrested this could not be accomplished when he
was in his automobile on land or in his boat on the
water no he must be seized suddenly before he
had any opportunity to escape by means of that speed
which no other machine could equal

   was therefore all alert awaiting an order from
mr ward to start out with my men but the order
did not arrive for the very good reason that the man
whom it concerned remained undiscovered the lend
of july approached the newspapers continued the
excitement they published repeated rumors new
clues were constantly being announced but all this
was mere idle talk telegrams reached the police
bureau from every part of america each contradict-
ing and nullifying the others the enormous rewards

 offered could not help but lead to accusations errors
 and blunders made many of them in good faith
 one time it would be a cloud of dust which must
 have contained the automobile at another time
 almost any wave on any of americas thousand lakes
 represented the submarine in truth in the excited
 state of the public imagination apparitions assailed
 us from every side

 at last on the twenty-ninth of july i received a
 telephone message to come to mr ward on the in-
 stant

 twenty minutes later i was in his cabinet

 you leave in an hour strock said he

 where for

 for toledo

 it has been seen 

 yes at toledo you will get your final orders
 in an hour my men and i will be on the way
 good and strock i now give you a formal
 order

 what is it mr ward

 to succeed-this time to succeed

revolt of the pedestrians
bj david hkslletmd-

    for a day the average new yorker while gripped with fear crying with fright remained within his car then came mass move-
 ment-a slow tortuous movement of crippled animals dragging legless bodies forward by arms unused to muscular exercise-a slow
 convulsive worm-like panic    into this world of horror miller walked as he emerged from the office building


the revolt of the pedestrians



rash

  damn these pedestrians anyway

  a deathly moan and a determined
mutter of your whole race will pay for
i this came in one breath from the auto-
mobile the chauffeur the murdered mother and the
ghastly lips of the little pedestrian son who was left
mercilessly with the lifeless corpse in the slaughter
pen of humanity

  a young pedestrian mother was walking slowly
down a country road holding her little son by her
hand they were both beautiful examples of pedes-
trians though tired and dusty from long days spent
on their journey from ohio to arkansas where the
pitiful remnant of the doomed species were gathering
for the final struggle for several days these two
had walked the roads westward escaping instant
death again and again by repeated miracles yet this
afternoon tired hungry and hypnotized by the set-
ting sun in her face the woman slept even as she
walked and only woke screaming when she realized
that escape was impossible she succeeded in push-
ing her son to safety in the gutter and then died in-
stantly beneath the wheels of a skilfully driven car
going at sixty miles an hour

  the lady in the sedan was annoyed at the jolt and
spoke rather sharply to the chauffeur through the
speaking tube

  what was that jar william

  madam we have just run over a pedestrian
oh is that all  well at least you should be care-
ful

  there is only one way to hit a pedestrian safely
madam when one is going sixty miles an hour and
that is to hit him hard

  william is such a careful driver said the lady
to her little daughter he just ran over a pedestrian
and there was only the slightest jar

   the little girl looked with pride on her new dress
it was her eighth birthday and they were going to
her grandmothers for the day her twisted
atrophied legs moved in slow rhythmic movements
it was her mothers pride to say that her little
daughter had never tried to walk she could think
however and something was evidently worrying her
she looked up

  mother she asked

do pedestrians feel pain
the way we do

  why of course not

darling said the mother

they are not like us in
fact some say they are not
human beings at all

  are they like mon-
keys 

  well perhaps higher
than apes but much lower
than automobilists

  the machine sped on

  miles behind a terror-
stricken lad lay sobbing on the bleeding body of his
mother which he somehow had found strength to
drag to the side of the road he remained there till
another day dawned and then left her and walked
slowly up the hills into the forest he was hungry
and tired sleepy and heart broken but he paused for
a moment on the crest of the hill and shook his fist
in inarticulate rage

  that day a deep hatred was formed in his soul

  the world had gone automobile wild traffic cops
had no time for snail-like movements of walkers-
they were a menace to civilization-a drawback to
progress-a defiance to the development of science
nothing mattered in a mans body but his brains

  gradually machinery had replaced muscle as a
means of attaining mans desire on earth life con-
sisted only of a series of explosions of gasoline or
alcohol-air mixtures or steam expansion in hollow
cylinders and turbines and this caused ingeniously
placed pistons to push violently against shafts which
caused power to be applied wherever the mind of man
dictated all mankind was accomplishing their
desires by mechanical energy made in small amounts
for individual purposes and in large amounts trans-
mitted over wires as electricity for the use of vast
centers of population

  the sky always had its planes the higher levels
for the inter-city express service the lower for in-
dividual suburban traffic-the roads all of reinforced
concrete were often one-way roads exacted by the
number of machines in order to avoid continual col-
lisions while part of the world had taken readily
to the skies the vast proportion had been forced by
insufficient development of the semi-circular canals
to remain on earth

  the automobile had developed as legs had
atrophied no longer content to use it constantly
outdoors the successors of ford had perfected the
smaller individual machine for use indoors all steps
being replaced by curving ascending passages men
thus came to live within metal bodies which they left
only for sleep gradually partly through necessity
and partly through inclination the automobile was
used in sport as well as in play special types were
developed for golf children seated in autocars rolled
hoops through shady parks lazily prostrate on one
a maiden drifted through the tropical waters of a
florida resort mankind had ceased to use their
lower limbs

  with disuse came atrophy with atrophy came pro-
gressive and definite changes in the shapes of man-
kind  with these changes came new conceptions of
beauty-feminine all this happened not in one gen-
eration nor in ten but
gradually in the course of
centuries

   ustoms changed
so laws changed no
longer were laws for
everyones good but only
for the benefit of the auto-
mobilist the roads form-
erly for the benefit of all
were finally restricted to
those in machines at
first it was merely danger-
ous to walk on the high-
ways later it became a
crime like all changes this came slowly first
came a law restricting certain roads to automobilists
then came a law prohibiting pedestrians from the
use of roads then a law giving them no legal re-
course if injured while walking on a public highway
later it became a felony to do so

  then came the final law providing for the legal
murder of all pedestrians on the highway wherever

   t tere at last is a different story with a different
 jli theme what zuill happen to us the author must
 have asked himself if we continue to ride in cars for
 centuries to come you may laugh at the idea that we
 will lose the use of our legs entirely but the idea is not
 as foolish as it may sound

   there is excellent science in this story and if you do
 not believe that too much riding in cars is bad for you
 just speak to your doctor and get his advice

   here is a story worth reading because many of the
 things of which the author speaks are gradually coming
 about there was a time when pedestrians had certain
 rights in our large cities however these rights are
 practically lost even noiv but read for yourself and

amazing stories

or whenever they could be hit by an auto

   no one was content to go slowly-all the world
 was crazed by a desire for speed there was also a
 desire no matter where an automobilist was to go
 to some other city thus sundays and holidays
 were distinguished by thousands and millions of
 automobilists going somewhere none being content
 to spend the hours of leisure quietly where they were
 rural landscapes consisted of long lines of machines
 passing between walls of advertisements at the rate
 of  miles an hour pausing now and then at gasoline
 filling stations at road houses or to strip an occa-
 sional tree of its blooms the air was filled with
 vapors from the exhausts of machinery and the
 raucous noise of countless horns of all description
 no one saw anything no one wanted to see any-
 thing the desire of each driver was to drivefaster
 than the car ahead of his it was called in the
 vernacular of the day-a quiet sunday in the
 country

   there were no pedestrians that is almost none
 even in the rural districts mankind was on wheels
 mechanically propelled such farming as was done
 vvas done by machinery here and there clinging
 like mountain sheep to inaccessible mountain-sides
 remained a few pedestrians who partly from choice
 but mainly from necessity had retained the desire to
 use their legs these people were always poor at
 first the laws had no terror for them every state
 had some families who had never ceased to be
 pedestrians on these the automobilists looked first
 with amusement and then with- alarm no one
 realized the tremendous depth of the chasm between
 the two groups of the genus homo till the national
 law was passed forbidding the use of all highways to
 pedestrians at once all over the united states
 the revolt of the walkers began although bunker
 hill was hundreds of years away the spirit of
 bunker hill survived and the prohibition of walking
 on the roads only increased the desire to do so more
 pedestrians than ever were accidentally killed their
 families retaliated by using every effort to make auto-
 mobiling unpleasant and dangerous-nails tacks
 glass logs barbed wire huge rocks were used as
 weapons in the ozarks backwoodsmen took de-
 light in breaking windshields and puncturing tires
 with well-directed rifle shots others walked the
 roads and defied the automobilists had the odds
 been equal a condition of anarchy would have re-
 sulted being unequal the pedestrians were simply a
 nuisance class-consciousness reached its acme when
 senator glass of new york rose in the senate
 chambers and said in part

   a race that ceases to develop must die out for
 centuries mankind has been on wheels and thus has
 advanced towards a state of mechanical perfection
 the pedestrian careless of his inherent right to ride
 has persisted not only in walking but even has gone
 so far as to claim equal rights with the higher type
 of automobilists patience has ceased to be a virtue
 nothing more can be done for these miserable de-
 generates of our race the kindest thing to do now
 is to inaugurate a process of extermination only
 thus can we prevent a continuation of the disorders
 which have marked the otherwise uniform peaceful
 history of our fair land there is therefore nothing
 for me to do save to urge the passage of the pedes-
 trian extermination act this as you know pro-
 vides for the instant death of all pedestrians where-

 ever and whenever they are found by the constabu-
 lary of each state the last census shows there are
 only about ten thousand left and these are mostly in
 a few of the mid-western states i am proud to state
 that my own constituency which up to yesterday had
 only one pedestrian an old man over  years of age
 has now a clear record a telegram just received
 states that fortunately he tottered on a public road
 in a senile effort to visit his wifes grave and was
 instantly killed by an automobilist but though new
 tork has at present none of these vile degenerates
 we are anxious to aid our less fortunate states

    he law was instantly passed being opposed only
 by the senators from kentucky tennessee and
 arkansas i o promote interest a bounty was placed
 on each pedestrian killed a silver star was given to
 each county reporting complete success a gold star
 to each state containing only autoists the pedes-
 trian like the carrier pigeon was doomed

 i t is not to be expected that the extermination was
 immediate or complete there was some unex-
 pected resistance it had been in effect one year
 when the pedestrian child swore vengeance on the
 mechanical means of destroying humanity

   sunday afternoon a hundred years later the acad-
 emy of natural sciences in philadelphia was filled
 with the usual throng of pleasure seekers each in
 his own auto-car noiselessly on rubber-tired
 wheels they journeyed down the long aisles pausing
 now and then before this exhibit or that which at-
 tracted their individual attention a father was tak-
 ing his little boy through and each was greatly in-
 terested the boy in the new world of wonders the
 father in the boys intelligent questions and observa-
 tions finally the boy stopped his auto-car in front
 of a glass case

   w hat is that father  they look as we do only
 what peculiar shapes

   that my son is a family of pedestrians it was
 long ago it all happened and i know of it only be-
 cause my mother told me about them this family
 was shot in the ozark mountains it is believed they
 were the last in the world

   i am sorry said the boy slowly if there were
 more i would like you to get a little one for me to
 play with

   there are no more said the father they are
 all dead

   the man thought he was telling the truth to his
 son in fact he prided himself on always being
 truthful to children yet he was wrong for a few
 pedestrians remained and their leader in fact their
 very brains was the great-grandson of the little boy
 who had stood up on the hill with hatred in his heart
 long before

   irrespective of climatic conditions environment
 and all varieties of enemies man has always been
 able to exist with the race of pedestrians it was
 in very truth the survival of the fittest only the
 most agile intelligent and sturdy were able to sur-
 vive the systematic attempt made to exterminate
 them though reduced in numbers they survived
 though deprived of all the so-called benefits of mod-
 ern civilization they existed forced to defend not
 only their individual existence but also the very life
 of their race they gained the cunning of their back-
 woodsmen ancestors and kept alive they lived
 hunted loved and died and for two generations the
the revolt of the pedestrians



 civilized world was unaware of their very existence
 they had their political organization their courts of
 law justice based on blackstone and the constitu-
 tion ruled always a miller ruled first the little
 boy with hatred in his heart grown to manhood
 then his son trained from childhood to the sole task
 of hatred of all things mechanical then the grand-
 son wise cunning a dream-builder and finally the
 great-grandson abraham miller prepared by three
 generations for the ultimate revenge

  abraham miller was the hereditary president of
the colony of pedestrians hidden in the ozark
mountains they were isolated but not ignorant
few in number but adaptive the first fugitives had
many brilliant men inventors college professors
patriots and even a learned jurist these men kept
their knowledge and transmitted it they dug in
the fields hunted in the woods fished in the streams
and builded in their laboratories they even had
automobiles and now and then with limbs tied
close to their bodies would travel as spies into the
land of the enemy certain of the children were
trained from childhood to act in this capacity
there is even evidence that for some years one of
these spies lived in st louis

  it was a colony with a single ambition-a union
of individuals for one purpose only the children
lisped it the school children spoke it daily the young
folks whispered it to each other in the moonlight
in the laboratories it was carved on every wall the
senile gathered their children around and swore them
to it every action of the colony was bent toward
one end-

  we will go back

  they were paranoiac in their hatred without
exception all of their ancestors had been hunted like
wild beasts exterminated without mercy-like ver-
min it was not revenge they desired but liberty-
the right to live as they wished to go and come as
they pleased

   for three generations the colony had preserved the
secret of their existence year by year as a unit
they had lived worked and died for a single ambi-
tion now the time had come for the execution

	of their plans the fulfillment of their desires mean-
while the world of automobilists lived on material-
istic mechanical selfish  socialism had provided
comfort for the masses but had singularly failed to
provide happiness all lived everyone had an in-
come no one but was provided with a home food and
clothes but the homes were of concrete they were
uniform poured out by the million the furniture
was concrete poured with the houses the cloth-
ing was paper water-proofed it was all in one de-
sign and was furnished-four suits a year to each
person the food was sold in bricks each brick
containing all the elements necessary for the con-
tinuation of life on every brick was stamped the
number of calories for centuries inventors had
invented till finally life became uniform and work a
matter of push buttons yet the world of the auto-
ists was an unhappy one for no one worked with
muscles in summer time it was of course neces-
sary to perspire but for generations no one had
sweated the words toil labor work were
marked obsolete in the dictionaries

   yet no one was happy because it was found to be
a mechanical impossibility to invent an automobile
that would travel over one hundred and twenty miles

an hour and stay on the ordinary country road the
automobilists could not go as fast as they wanted
to space could not be annihilated time could not
be destroyed

  besides everyone was toxic the air was filled
with the dangerous vapors generated by the combus-
tion of millions of gallons of gasoline and its sub-
stitutes even though many machines were electri-
fied the greatest factor contributing to this toxe-
mia however was the greatly reduced excretion of
toxins through the skin and the almost negative pro-
duction of energy through muscular contraction
the automobilists had ceased to work using the term
in its purely archaic form and having ceased to
work they had ceased to sweat a few hours a
day on a chair in a factory or at a desk was suffi-
cient to earn the necessaries of life the automo-
bilist never being tired nature demanded a lesser
number of hours spent in sleep the remaining hours
were spent in automobiles going somewhere it mat-
tered not where they went so long as they went fast
babies were raised in machines in fact all life was
lived in them the american home had disap-
peared-it was replaced by the automobile

  the automobilists were going somewhere but were
not sure where the pedestrians were confident of
where they were going

  society in its modern sense was socialistic this
implied that all classes were comfortable crime
as such had ceased to exist some generations pre-
vious following the putting into force of bryants
theory that all crime was due to  per cent of the
population and that if these were segregated and
sterilized crime would cease in one generation
when bryant first promulgated his thesis it was re-
ceived with some scepticism but its practical appli-
cation was hailed with delight by everyone who was
not directly affected

yet even in this apparently perfect society there
were defects though everyone had all the
necessities of life it was not true of luxuries in
other words there were still rich men and poor men
and the wealthy still dominated the government and
made the laws

  among the rich there were none more exclusive
aristocratic and dominant than the heislers their
estate on the hudson was enclosed by thirty miles of
twelve-foot iron fence few could boast of having
visited there of having week-ended in the stone
palace surrounded by a forest of pine beach and
hemlock they were so powerful that none of the
family had ever held a public office they made
presidents but never cared to have one in the family
their enemies said that their wealth came from for-
tunate marriages with the ford and rockefeller fam-
ilies but no doubt this was a falsehood based on
jealousy the heislers had banks and real estate
they owned factories and office buildings it was
definitely stated that they owned the president of the
united states and the judges of the supreme court
one of their possessions was rarely spoken of or
mentioned in the newspapers the only child of
the ruling branch of the family walked

  william henry heisler was an unusual millionaire
when told that his wife had presented him with a
daughter he promised his gods though he was not
certain who they were that he would spend at least
an hour a day with this child supervising her care


amazing stories

  for some months nothing unusual was noticed
about this little girl baby though at once all the
nurses commented on her ugly legs her father
simply considered that probably all baby legs were
ugly

   at the age of one year the baby tried to stand and
take a step even this was passed over as the ped-
estricians were united in the opinion that all chil-
dren tried to use their legs for a few months but
it was a bad habit usually easily broken up like
thumb-sucking they gave the usual advice to the
nurses which would have been followed had it not
been for her father who merely stated every child
has a personality let her alone see what she will
do and in order to insure obedience he selected
one of his private secretaries who was to bevin con-
stant attendance and make daily written reports

  the child grew there came the time when she
was no longer called baby but dignified by the
name of margaretta as she grew her legs grew
the more she walked the stronger they became
there was no one to help her for none of the adults
had ever walked nor had they seen anyone walk
she not only walked but she objected in her own
baby way to mechanical locomotion she screamed
like a baby wild cat at her first introduction to an
automobile and never could become reconciled even
to the auto cars for house use

   when it was too late her father consulted every-
one who could possibly know anything about the
situation and its remedy heisler wanted his child
to develop her own personality but he did not want
her to be odd he therefore gathered in consulta-
tion neurologists anatomists educators phycholo-
gists students of child behavior and obtained no
satisfaction from them all agreed that it was a
pitiful case of atavism a throwback as for a cure
there were a thousand suggestions from psycho-
analysis to the brutal splinting and bandaging of
the little girls lower extremeties finally in disgust
heisler paid them all for their trouble and bribed
them all for their silence and told them sharply to
go to hell he had no idea where this place was
or just what he meant but found some relief in say-
ing it

 they all left promptly except one who in addi-
tion to his other vocations followed geneaolgy as
an avocation he was an old man and they made
an interesting contrast as they sat facing each other
in their autocars heisler was middle aged vigor-
ous real leader of men gigantic save for his
shrunken legs the other man was old gray haired
withered a dreamer they were alone in the room
save for the child who played happily in the sun-
shine of the large bay windows

   i thought i told you to go to hell with the rest
growled the leader of men

 how can i  was the mild reply those others
did not obey you they simply autoed out of your
home i am waiting for you to tell me how to go
there where is this hell you order us to our
submarines have explored the ocean bed five miles
below sea level our aeroplanes have gone some
miles toward the stars mount everest has been con-
quered i read all these journeyings but nowhere
do i read of a hell some centuries ago theologians
said it was a place that sinners went to when they
died but there has been no sin since bryants two
per cent were identified and sterilized you with

your millions and limitless power are as near hell
as you will ever be when you look at your abnormal
child

   but she is bright mentally professor protested
heisler only seven years old but tested ten years
by the simon binet scale if only she would stop
this damned walking oh i am proud of her but
i want her to be like other girls who will want
to marry her its positively indecent look at her
what is she doing

   why bless me exclaimed the old man i read
of that in a book three hundred years old just the
other day lots of children used to do that

   but what is it

   why it used to be called turning somersaults 
   but what does it mean why does she do it
   heisler wiped the sweat off his face

  it will all make us ridiculous if it becomes
known

   oh well with your power you can keep it quiet-
but have you studied your family history do
you knowavhat blood strains are in her

  no i never was interested of course i be-
long to the sons of the american revolution and
all that sort of thing they brought me the papers
and i signed on the dotted line i never read them
though i paid well to have a book published about
it all

  so you had a revolutionary ancestor wheres
the book 

heisler rang for his private secretary who
autoed in received his curt orders and soon
returned with the heisler family history which the
old man opened eagerly save for the noise made
by the child who was playing with a small stuffed
bear the room was deadly still suddenly the old
man laughed

   it is all as plain as can be your revolutionary
ancestor was a miller abraham miller of hamil-
ton township his mother was captured and killed
by indians they were pedestrians of the most
pronounced strain of course every one was a pe-
destrian in those days the millers and the heislers
intermarried that was some hundred years ago
your great grandfather heisler had a sister who
married a miller she is spoken of here on page
 let me read it to you

    margaretta heisler was the only sister of wil-
liam heisler independent and odd in many ways
she committed the folly of marrying a farmer by the
name of abraham miller who was one of the most
noted leaders in the pedestrian riots in pennsylvania
following his death his widow and only child a boy
eight years old disappeared and no doubt were de-
stroyed in the general process of pedestrian exter-
mination an old letter written by her to her
brother prior to her marriage contained the boast
that she never had ridden in an automobile and never
would that god had given her legs and she intended
to use them and that she was fortunate in finally
finding a man who also had legs and the desire to
live on them as god had planned men and women
to do

   there is the secret of this child of yours she is
a reversal to the sister of your great grandfather
that lady died a hundred years ago rather than fol-
low the fashion you say yourself that this little
one nearly died from convulsions when the attempt
the revolt of the pedestrians



was made to put her in an automobile it is a clear
case of heredity if you try to break the child of
the habit you will probably kill her the only thing
to do is to leave her alone let her develop as she
wishes she is your daughter her will is your
will the probability is that neither can change
the other let her use her legs she probably will
climb trees run swim wander where she will

  so that is the way of it sighed heisler that
means the end of our family no one would want to
marry a monkey no matter how intelligent she is
so you think she will some day climb a tree if
there is a hell this is mine as you suggest

  but she is happy

  yes if laughter is an index but will she be as
she grows older she will be different how can
she have associates of course they wont afpply
that extermination law in her case my position will
prevent that i could even have it repealed but
she will be lonely-so lonely

  perhaps she will learn to read-then she wont
be lonely

  they both looked at the child

  what is she doing now demanded heisler
you seem to know more than anyone i ever met
about such things

  why she is hopping is not that remarkable
she never saw anyone hop and yet she is doing it
i never saw a child do it and yet i can identify it
and give it a name in kate greenaways illustra-
tions i have seen pictures of children hopping
confound the millers anyway growled heisler
after that conversation heisler engaged the old
man whose sole duty was to investigate the subject
of pedestrian children and find how they played and
used their legs having investigated this he was to
instruct the little girl

  the entire matter of her exercise was left to him
thus from that day on a curious spectator from an
aeroplane might have seen an old man sitting on the
lawn showing a golden-haired child pictures from
very old books and talking together about the same
pictures then the child would do things that no
child had done for a hundred years-bounce a ball
skip rope dance folk dances and jump over a bam-
boo stick supported by two upright bars long
hours were spent in reading and always the old man
would begin by saying

  now this is the way they used to do
occasionally a party would be given for her and
other little girls from the neighboring rich would
come and spend the day they were polite-so was
margaretta heisler-but the parties were not a suc-
cess the company could not move except in their
autocars and they looked on their hostess with curi-
osity and scorn they had nothing in common with
the curious walking child and these parties always
left margaretta in tears

  why cant i be like other girls she demanded
of her father is it always going to be this way
do you know that girls laugh at me because i walk
heisler was a good father he hekl to his vow to
devote one hour a day to his daughter and during
that time gave of his intelligence as eagerly and
earnestly as he did to his business in the other hours
often he talked to margaretta as though she were
his equal an adult with full mental development

  you have your own personality he would say
to her the mere fact that you are different from

other people does not of necessity mean that they
are right and you are wrong perhaps you are both
right-at least you are both following out your nat-
ural proclivities you are different in desires and
physique from the rest of us but perhaps you are
more normal than we are the professor shows us
pictures of ancient peoples and they all had legs de-
veloped like yours how can i tell whether man has
degenerated or improved at times when i see you
run and jump i envy you i and all of us are tied
down to earth-dependent on a machine for every
part of our daily life you can go where you please
you can do this and all you need is food and sleep
in some ways this is an advantage on the other
hand the professor tells me that you can only go
about four miles an hour while i can go over one
hundred

  but why should i want to go so fast when i do
not want to go anywhere

  that is just the astonishing thing why dont
you want to go it seems that not only your body
but also your mind your personality your desires
are old-fashioned hundreds of years old-fashioned
 try to be here in the house or garden every day-
at least an hour-with you but during the other
waking hours i want to go you do the strangest
hings the professor tells me about it all there
is your bow and arrow for instance i bought you
the finest firearms and you never use them but you
get a bow and arrow from some museum and finally
succeed in killing a duck and the professor said you
built a fire out of wood and roasted it and ate it
you even made him eat some

  but it was good father-much better than the
synthetic food even the professor said the juice
made him feel younger

  heisler laughed you are a savage-nothing
more than a savage

  but i can read and write

  i admit that well go ahead and enjoy your-
self i only wish i could find another savage for
you to play with but there are no more

  are you sure

  as much so a i can be in fact for the last
five years my agents have been scouring the civil-
ized world for a pedestrian colony there are a
few in siberia and the tartar plateau but they are
impossible i would rather have you associate with
apes

  i dream of one father whisperedthe girl shyly
he is a nice boy and he can do everything i can
do dreams ever come true

  heisler smiled i trust this one will and now i
must hurry back to new york can i do anything
for you

  yes-find some one who can teach me how to
make candles

  candles why what are they

  she ran and brought an old book and read it to
him it was called the gentle pirate and the
hero always read in bed by candle light

  i understand he finally said as he closed the
book i remember now that i once read of their
having something like that in the catholic churches
so you want to make some  see the professor and
order what you need hum-candles-why they
would be handy at night if the electricity failed but
then it never does


amazing stories

  but i dont want electricity i want candles and
matches to light them with

  matches

  oh father in some ways you are ignorant
i know lots of words you dont even though you are
so rich

  i admit it i will admit anything and we will
find how to make your candles shall i send you
some ducks

  oh no it is so much more fun to shoot them
  you are a real barbarian

  and you are a dear ignoramus

  so it came to pass that margaretta heisler reached
her seventeenth birthday tall strong agile brown
from constant exposure to wind and sun able to
run jump shoot accurately with bow and arrow
an eater of meat a reader of books by candje light
a weaver of carpets and a lover of nature her
associates had been mainly elderly men only occa-
sionally would she see the ladies of the neighbor-
hood she tolerated the servants the maids and
housekeeper the love she gave her father she also
gave to the old professor but he had taught her all
she knew and the years had made him senile and
sleepy

  there came to her finally the urge to travel she
wanted to see new york with its twenty million auto-
mobilists its hundred story office buildings its
smokeless factories its standardized houses there
were difficulties in the way of such a trip and no
one knew these better than her father the roads
were impossible and all of new york was now
either streets or houses there being no pedestrians
there was no need of sidewalks besides even
heisler s wealth would not be able to prevent the
riot sure to result from the presence in a large city
of such a curiosity as a pedestrian heisler was
powerful but he dreaded the result of allowing his
daughter the freedom of new york furthermore
up to this time her deformity was known only to a
few once she was in new york the city papers
would publish his disgrace to the world

several of the office buildings in new york
city were one hundred stories high there
were no stairways but as a safety precaution circular
spiral ramps had been built in each structure for the
use of autocars in case the elevators failed to work
this however never happened and few of the ten-
ants ever knew of their existence they were used
at night by the scrub women busily autocarring from
one floor to another cleaning up the higher the
floor the purer was the air and the more costly was
the yearly rental below in the canyon and the
street an ozone machine was necessary every few
feet to purify the air and make unnecessary the use
of gas masks on the upper floors however there
were pure breezes from off the atlantic noticeable
was the absence of flies and mosquitoes pigeons
built their nests in the crevices and on the highest
roof a pair of american eagles nested year after
year in haughty defiance of the mechanical auto a
thousand feet below

  it was in the newest building in new york and on
the very highest floor that a new office was opened
on the door was the customary gilded sign new
york electrical co boxes had been left there
decorators had embellished the largest room the
final result being that it was simply a standardized

office a stenographer had been installed and sat
at a noiseless machine answering if need be the
automatic telephone

  to this roomy suite one day in june came by in-
vitation a dozen of the leaders of industry they
came each thinking he was the only one invited to
the conference surprise as well as suspicion was
the marked feature of the meeting there were
three men there who were secretly and independently
trying to undermine heisler and tear him from his
financial throne heisler himself was there ap-
parently quiet but inwardly a seething flame of re-
pressed electricity the stenographer seated them
as they arrived in order around a long table they
remained in their autocars no one used chairs
one or two of the men joked with each other all
nodded to heisler but none spoke to him

  the furniture surroundings stenographer were
all part of the standard office in the business section
only one small portion of the room aroused their
curiosity at the head of the table was an arm
chair none of the men around the table had ever
used a chair none had seen one save in the metro-
politan museum the autocar had replaced the
chair even as the automobile had replaced the human
leg

  the chimes in the tower nearly rang out the two
oclock message all of the twelve looked at their
watches one man frowned his watch was some
minutes late in another minute all were frowning
they had a two-oclock appointment with this
stranger and he had not kept it to them time was
valuable

  then a door opened and the man walked in that
was the first astonishing thing-and then they mar-
veled at the size and shape of him there was
something uncanny about it-peculiar weird

  then the man sat down-in the chair he did not
seem much larger now than the the other men
though he was younger than any of them and had
a brown complexion which contrasted peculiarly with
the dead gray-white pallor of the others then
gravely almost mechanically with clear distinct
enunciation he began to speak

  i see gentlemen that you have all honored me
by accepting my invitation to be present this after-
noon you will pardon my not informing any of
you that the others were also invited had i done
so several of you would have refused to come and
without any one of you the meeting would not be as
successful as i intended it to be

  the name of this company is the new york
electrical co that is just a name assumed as a
mask in reality there is no company i am the
representative of the nation of pedestrians in fact
i am their president and my name is abraham mil-
ler four generations ago as no doubt you know
congress passed the pedestrian extermination act
following that those who continued to walk were
hunted like wild animals slaughtered without mercy
my great-grandfather abraham miller was killed
in pennsylvania his wife was run down on the pub-
lic highway in ohio as she was attempting to join
the other pedestrians in the ozarks there were no
battles there was no conflict at that time there
were only ten thousand pedestrians in all the united
states within a few years there were none-at
least so your ancestors thought the race of pedes-
trians however survived we lived on the trials
the revolt of the pedestrians



of those early years are written in our histories and
taught to our children we formed a colony and
continued our existence although we disappeared
from the world as you know it

  year by year we lived on until now we number
over two hundred persons in our republic we are
not in fact never have been ignorant always we
worked for one purpose and that was the right to
return to the world our motto for one hundred
years has been

we will go back

  so i have come to new york and called you into
conference while you were selected for your in-
fluence wealth and ability there was present in
every instance another important reason each of
you is a lineal decendant of a united states senator
who voted for the pedestrian extermination - act
you can readily see the significance of that you
have the power to undo a great injustice done to a
branch of american citizens will you let us come
back we want to come back as pedestrians to
come and go as we please safely some of us can
drive automobiles and aeroplanes but we dont want
to we want to walk and if a mood strikes us to
walk in the highway we want to do it without con-
stant danger of death we do not hate you we
pity you there is no desire to antagonize you
rather we want to cooperate with you

    x e believe in work-muscle work no matter
vv what our young people are trained for they
are taught to work-to do manual work we under-
stand machinery but do not like to use it the only
help we accept is from domestic animals horses and
oxen in several places we use water power to run
our grist mills and saw our timbers for pleasure
we hunt fish play tennis swim in our mountain
lake we keep our bodies clean and try to do the
same with our minds our boys marry at -our
girls at  occasionally a child grows up to be
abnormal-degenerate i frankly say that such
children disappear we eat meat and vegetables
fish and grain raised in our valley the time has
come when we cannot care for a continued increase
in population the time has come when we must
come back into the world what we desire is a
guarantee of safety i will now leave you in con-
ference for fifteen minutes and at the end of such
time i will return for an answer if you have any
questions i will answer them then

  he left the room one of the men rolled over to
the telephone found the wire cut another went over
to the door and found it locked the stenographer
had disappeared there followed sharp discussion
marked by temper and lack of logic one man only
kept silent heisler sat motionless so much so that
the cigar clenched between his teeth went out

  then miller came back a dozen questions were
hurled at him one man swore at him finally
there was silence

  well questioned miller

  give us time-a week in which to discuss it-to
ascertain public opinion urged one of them

  no said heisler let us give our answer now
oh of course sneered one of his bitter op-
ponents your reason for giving a decision is plain
though it has never been in the newspapers

for that said heisler i am going to get you

you are a cur and you know it or you would not
drag my family into this

  oh h- heisler-you cant bluff me any more 
  miller hit the table with his list-

  whats your answer

  one of the men held up his hand for an audience
we all know the history of pedestrianism the
two groups represented here cannot live together
there are two hundred million of us and two hun-
dred of them let them stay in their valley that
is what i think if this man is their leader we can
judge what the colony is like they are ignorant
anarchists there is no telling what they would de-
mand if we listened to them i think we should
have this man arrested he is a menace to society
that broke the ice one after another they spoke
and when they finished it was plain that all save
heisler were hostile antagonistic and merciless
miller turned to him-

  what is your verdict

  i am going to keep quiet these men know it all
you have heard them they are a unit what i
would say can make no difference in fact i dont
care for some time i have ceased to care about
anything

  miller turned in his swivel chair and looked out
over the city in some ways it was a pretty city if
one liked such a place under him in the city streets
in the bee-hives over twenty million automobilists
spent their lives on wheels not one in a million
had a desire beyond the city limits the roads con-
necting the metropolis with other cities were but
urban arteries wherein the automobiles passed like
corpuscles the auto-trucks proceeded like plasma
miller feared the city but he pitied the legless pig-
mies inhabiting it

  then he turned again and asked for silence

  i wanted to make a peaceful adjustment we
desire no more bloodshed no more internecine strife
you who lead public sentiment have by your recent
talk shown me that the pedestrian can expect no
mercy at the hands of the present government you
know and i know that this is no longer a nation
where the people rule you rule you elect whom
you please for senators for presidents you snap
your whip and they dance that is why i came to
you men instead of making a direct appeal to the
government feeling confident what your action
would be i have prepared this short paper which
i will ask you to sign it contains a single state-
ment 

the pedestrians cannot return

  when you have all signed this i will explain to
you just what we will do

  why sign it said the first man the one seated
to the right of miller now my idea is this and
he crumpled the paper to a tight ball and threw it
under the table his conduct was at once followed
by applause only heisler sat still miller looked
out the window till all was quiet

in ally he spoke again

in our colony we have perfected a new elec-
tro-dynamic principle released it at once separates
the atomic energy which makes possible all move-
ment save muscle movement we have tested this
out with smaller machines in limited space and know
exactly what we can do we do not know how to


amazing stokieb

restore the energy in any territory where we have
once destroyed it our electricians are waiting for
my signal transmitted by radio in fact they have
been listening to all this conversation and i will
now give them the signal to throw the switch the
signal is our motto

we will come back 

  so that is the signal sneered one of the men
what happened

  nothing much replied heisler at least i see
no difference what was supposed to happen abra-
ham miller

  nothing much said miller only the destruc-
tion of all mankind except the pedestrians we
tried to imagine what would happen when our elec-
tricians threw the switch and released this new prin-
ciple but even our sociologists could not fully imag-
ine what would be the result we do not know
whether you can live or die-whether any of you
can survive no doubt the city dwellers will die
speedily in their artificial bee-hives some in the
country may survive

  hello hello exclaimed a multi-millionaire i
feel no different you are a dreamer of dreams
i am leaving and will report you at once to the
police open your damn door and let us out
miller opened the door

  most of the men pressed their starting button
and took hold of the steering rod not a machine
moved the others startled tried to leave their
auto cars were dead then one with a hysterical
curse raised an automatic at miller and pulled the
trigger there was a click-and nothing more
miller pulled out his watch

  it is now  p m the automobilists are be-
ginning to die they do not know it yet when
they do there will be a panic we cannot give any
relief there are only a few hundred of us and we
cannot feed and care for hundreds of millions of
cripples fortunately there is a circular inclined
plane or ramp in this building and your autocars are
all equipped with brakes i will push you one at a
time to the plane if you will steer your cars ob-
viously you do not care to remain here and equally
obviously the elevators are not running i will call
on my stenographer to help me perhaps you sus-
pected before that he was a pedestrian trained from
boyhood to take female parts he is one of our
most efficient spies and now we will say good-
bye a century ago you knowingly and willingly
tried to exterminate us we survived we do not
want to exterminate you but i fear for your future
thereupon he went behind one of the autocars and
started pushing it towards the doorway the steno-
grapher who had reappeared as a pedestrian and in
trousers took hold of another car soon only
heisler was left he held up his hand in protest

 would you mind pushing me over to that
window 

  miller did so the automobilist looked out curi-
ously

  there are no aeroplanes in the sky there should
be hundreds

  no doubt replied miller they have all planed
down to earth you see they have no power
then everything has stopped 

  almost there is still muscle power there
is still power produced by the bending of wood as in
a bow and arrow-also that produced by a metal coil

like the main spring in a watch you notice your
watch is still running of course domestic animals
can still produce power-that is just a form of
muscle power in our valley we have grist mills and
saw mills running by water power we can see no
reason why they should not keep on all other power
is destroyed do you realize it there is no elec-
tricity no steam no explosions of any kind all those
machines are dead heisler pulled out a handker-
chief slowly automatically and wiped the sweat
from his face as he said

  i can hear a murmur from the city it rises up
to this window like distant surf beating rhythmically
against a sandy shore i can hear no other noise
only this murmur it recalls to my mind the sound
of a swarm of bees leaving their old hive and flying
compactly through the air with their queen in the
center trying to find a new home there is a same-
ness to the noise like a distant waterfall what does
it mean i think i know but i cannot bear to say
it with words

  it means said miller that below us and around
us twenty million people are beginning to die in of-
fice buildings stores and homes in subways ele-
vators and trains in tubes and ferry boats on the
street and in the restaurant twenty million people
suddenly realize that they cannot move no one can
help them some have left their cars and are trying
to pull themselves along on their hands their with-
ered legs helplessly trailing behind them they are
calling to each other for help but even now they
cannot know the full extent of the disaster by to-
morrow each man will be a primitive animal in
a few days there will be no food no water i hope
they will die quickly-before they eat each other
the nation will die and no one will know about it
for there will be no newspapers no telephones no
wireless i will communicate with my people by
carrier pigeons it will be months before i can re-
join them meanwhile i can live i can go from
place to place the sound you hear from the city
is the cry of a soul in despair

heisler grabbed millers hand convulsively
but if you made it stop you can make it
start 

  no-we stopped it with electricity there is now
no more electricity i presume our own machines
were at once put out of power

  so we are going to die

  i believe so perhaps your scientists can invent
a remedy we did a hundred years ago we lived
your nation tried by every known scientific art to
destroy us but we lived perhaps you can how
can i tell we wanted to arbitrate all we asked
for was equality you saw how those other men
voted and how they thought if they had had the
power they would instantly have destroyed my little
colony what we did was simply done in self-pro-
tection

   heisler tried to light his cigar the electric lighter
would not work so he held it dry in his mouth in
one corner chewing it

  you say your name is abraham miller i be-
lieve we are cousins of some sort i have a book
that tells about it

i know all about that your great-grandfather
and my great-grandmother were brother and sister
i believe that is what the professor said except
the revolt of the pedestrians



that at that time we did not know about you what
i want to talk about however is my daughter

  the two men talked on and on the murmur
continued to mount from the city unceasing inces-
sant full of notes new to the present generation
yet at the distance-from the earth below to the
hundredth story above it was all one sound though
composed of millions of variants it blended into
unity miller finally began walking up and down
from one office wall to the window and back again

  i thought no one more free from nerves than
i was my whole life has been schooled in prepara-
tion for this moment we had right justice even
our forgotten god on our side i still can see no
other way no other way but this makes me sick
heisler it nauseates me when i was a boy i found
a mouse caught in a barn door almost torn in two
i tried to help it and the tortured animal bit my
finger so i simply had to break its neck it couldnt
live-and when i tried to help it it bit me so i
had to kill it do you understand i had to but
though i was justified i grew deadly sick i vomited
on the barn floor something like that is going on
below there twenty million deformed bodies all
around us are beginning to die they might have
been men and women like those we have in the
colony but they became obsessed with the idea of
mechanical devices of all kinds if i tried to help-
went into the street now-they would kill me i
couldnt keep them off me-i couldnt kill them fast
enough we were justified-man-we were justi-
fied but it makes me sick

   tt does not affect me that way replied heisler
i am accustomed to crushing out my opponents i
had to or they would crush me i look on all this
as a wonderful experiment for years i have
thought about our civilization-on account of my
daughter i have lost interest in many ways i
have lost my fighting spirit i dont seem to care
what happens but i would like to follow that cur
down the circular spiral plane and wrap my hands
around his neck i dont want him to die of hunger
no you stay here i want you to write a
history of it all-just how it happened we want
an accurate record to justify our action you stay
here and work with my stenographer i am going
to find your daughter we cannot let a pedestrian
suffer we will take you back with us with suit-
able apparatus you could learn to ride a horse
you want me to live

  yes but not for yourself there are a dozen
reasons for the next twenty years you can lecture
to our young people you can tell them what hap-
pened when the world ceased to work to sweat
when they deliberately exchanged the home for the
automobile and toil and labor for machinery you
can tell them that and they will believe you

  wonderful exclaimed heisler i have made
presidents and now i become a legless example for
a new world

  you will attain fame you will be the last auto-
mobilist

  lets start urged heisler call your stenog-
rapher 

  the stenographer had been in new york one
month prior to the meeting of miller and the repre-
sentatives of the automobilists during that time
thanks to his early training in mimicry as a spy he
had been absolutely successful in deceiving all he

came in contact with in his autocar dressed as a
stenographer his face perfumed and painted and
rings on his fingers he passed unnoticed amid the
other thousands of similar women he went to
their restaurants and to their theatres he even
visited them in their homes he was the perfect
spy but he was a man

   he had been trained to the work of a spy for
 years he had been imbued with loyalty to an en-
 thusiasm for his republic of pedestrians he had
 sworn to the oath-that the republic should come
 first abraham miller had selected him because he
 could trust him the spy was young with hardly
 a down on his cheeks he was celibate he was
 patriotic

 tut for the first time in his life he was in a
 big city the firm on the floor below employed
 a stenographer she was a very efficient worker in
 more ways than one and there was that about the
 new stenographer that excited her interest they
 met and arranged to meet again they talked about
 love the new love between women the spy did
 not understand this having never heard of such a
 passion but he did understand eventually the caresses
 and kisses she proposed that they room together
 but he naturally found objections however they
 had spent much of their spare time together more
 than once the pedestrian had been  the point of
 confiding to her not only concerning the impending
 calamity but also his real sex and his true love

   in such cases where a man falls in love with a
 woman the explanation is hard to find it is al-
 ways hard to find here there was something
 twisted a pathological perversion it was a mons-
 trous thing that he should fall in love with a legless
 woman when he might by waiting have married a
 woman with columns of ivory and knees of ala-
 baster instead he loved and desired a woman who
 lived in a machine it was equally pathological that
 she should love a woman each was sick-soul-
 sick and each to continue the intimacy deceived the
 other now with the city dying beneath him the
 stenographer felt a deep desire to save this legless
 woman i-ie felt that a way could be found some-
 how to persuade abraham miller to let him marry
 this stenographer-at least let him save her from the
 debacle

   so in soft shirt and knee trousers he cast a glance
 at miller and heisler engaged in earnest conversa-
 tion and then tiptoed out the door and down the
 inclined plane to the floor below here all was con-
 fusion boldly striding into the room where the
 stenographer had her desk he leaned over her and
 started to talk he told her that he was a man a
 pedestrian rapidly came the story of what it all
 meant the cries from below the motionless auto-
 cars the useless elevators the silent telephones he
 told her that the world of automobilists would die
 because of this and that but that she would live
 because of his love for her all he asked was the
 legal right to care for her to protect her they
 would go somewhere and live out in the country
 he would roll her around the meadows she could
 have geese baby geese that would come to her chair
 when she cried weete weete

   the legless woman listened what pallor there
 might be in her cheeks was skillfully covered with
 rouge she listened and looked at him a man a


amazing stories

 man with legs walking he said he loved her but
 the person she had loved was a woman a woman
 with dangling shrunken beautiful legs like her own
 not muscular monstrosities

  she laughed hysterically said she would marry
him go wherever he wanted her to go and then
she clasped him to her and kissed him full on the
mouth and then kissed his neck over the jugular
veins and he died bleeding into her mouth and the
blood mingled with rouge made her face a vivid
carmine she died some days later from hunger

  miller never knew where his stenographer died
had he time he might have hunted for him but he
began to share heislers anxiety about the pedes-
trian girl isolated and alone amid a world of dying
automobilists to the father she was a daughter
the only child the remaining and sole branaji of his
family to miller however she was a symbol
she was a sign of natures revolt an indication of
her last spasmodic effort to restore mankind to his
former place in the world her father wanted her
saved because she was his daughter the pedestrian
because she was one of them one of the race of
pedestrians

  on that hundredth floor kegs of water stores of
food had been provided every provision had been
made to sustain life in the midst of death heisler
was shown all these he was made comfortable
and then miller with some provisions a canteen of
water a road map and a stout club in his grasp
left that place of peace and quiet and started down
the spiral stairway at the best it was simply diffi-
cult walking the spirals being wide enough to pre-
vent dizziness what miller feared was the ob-
struction of the entire passage at some point by a
tangled mass of autocars but evidently all cars which
had managed to reach the plane had been able to
descend he paused now and then at this floor or
that shuddered at the cries he heard and then went
on down down into the street

  here it was even worse than he expected on
the second the electro-dynamic energy had been re-
leased from the ozark valley-on that very second
all machinery had ceased in new york city twenty
million people were in automobiles or autocars at
that particular second some were working at desks
in shops some were eating in restaurants loafing
at their clubs others were going somewhere sud-
denly everyone was forced to stay where he was
there was no cqmmunication save within the limits
of each ones voice the phone radio newspapers
were useless every autocar stopped every auto-
mobile ceased to move each man and woman was
dependent on his own body for existence no one
could help the other no one could help himself
transportation died and no one knew it had hap-
pened save in his own circle as far as the eye could
see or the ear could hear because communication
had died with the death of transportation each
automobilist stayed where he happened to be at that
particular moment

then slowly as the thought came to them that
movement was impossible there came fear and
with fear panic but it was a new kind of panic
all previous panics consisted in the sudden move-
ment of large numbers of people in the same direc-
tion fleeing from a real or an imaginary fear this
panic was motionless and for a day the average

new yorker while gripped with fear crying with
fright remained within his car then came mass-
movement but not the movement of previous panics
it was the slow tortuous movement of crippled
animals dragging legless bodies forward by arms
unused to muscular exercise it was not the rapid
wind-like movement of the frenzied panic stricken
mob but a slow convulsive worm-like panic word
was passed from one to another in hoarse whisper-
ings that the city was a place of death would be-
come a morgue that in a few days there would be
no food while no one knew what had happened
everyone knew that the city could not live long un-
less food came regularly from the country and the
country suddenly became more than long cement
roads between sign-boards it was a place where
food could be procured and water the city had
become dry the mammoth pump throwing mil-
lions of gallons of water to a careless population had
ceased to pump there was no more water save in
the rivers encircling the city and these were filth
man-polluted in the country there must be water
somewhere

  so on the second day began the flight from new
york-a flight of cripples not of eagles a passage
of humanity shaped like war-maimed soldiers their
speed was not uniform but the fastest could only
crawl less than a mile an hour philosophers would
have stayed where they were and died animals
thus tortured would quietly wait the end but these
automobilists were neither philosophers nor animals
and they had to move all their life they had been
moving the bridges were the first spaces to show
congestion on all of them were some automobiles
but traffic is not heavy at  in the afternoon gradu-
ally by noon of the second day these river highways
were black with people crawling to get away from
the city there came congestion and with conges-
tion stasis and with stasis simply a writhing with-
out progression then on top of this stationary
layer of humanity crawled another layer which in
its turn reached congestion and on top of the sec-
ond layer a third layer a dozen streets led to each
bridge but each bridge was only as wide as a street
gradually the outer rows of the upper layer began
falling into the river beneath ultimately many
sought this termination from the bridges came
ultimately a roar like surf beating against a rock-
bound shore in it was the beginnings of desperate
madness men died quickly on the bridges but be-
fore they died they started to bite each other with-
in the city certain places showed the same congestion
restaurants and cafes became filled with bodies al-
most to the ceiling there was food here but no
one could reach it save those next to it and these
were crushed to death before they could profit by
their good fortune and dying blocked with bodies
those who remained alive and able to eat

  within twenty-four hours mankind had lost its
religion its humanity its high ideals every one
tried to keep himself alive even though by doing so
he brought death sooner to others yet in isolated
instances individuals rose to heights of heroism
in the hospitals an occasional nurse remained with
her patients giving them food till she with them
died of hunger in one of the maternity wards a
mother gave birth to a child deserted by every-
one she placed the child to her breast and kept it
there till hunger pulled down her lifeless arms
the revolt of the pedestrians



  it was into this world of horror that miller walked
as he emerged from the office building he had pro-
vided himself with a stout club but hardly any of the
crawling automobilists noticed him so he walked
slowly over to fifth avenue and then headed north
and as he walked he prayed though on that first day
he saw but little of what he was to see later on

  on and on he went till he came to water and
that he swam and then again he went on and by
night he was out in the country where he ceased to
pray continuously here he met an occasional auto-
ist who was simply annoyed at his machine break-
ing down no one in the country realized at first
what had really happened no one ever fully realized
before he died in his farm house just what it all
meant it was only the city dwellers that knew
and they did not understand	

  the next day miller rose early from the grass
and started again after carefully consulting the road
map he avoided the towns circling them he
had learned the desire constant incessant inescap-
able to share his provisions with those starving crip-
ples and he had to keep his strength and save food
for her that pedestrian girl alone among helpless
servants within an iron fence thirty miles long it
was near the close of the second day of his walk
for some miles he had seen  one the sun low
in the forest of oaks threw fantastic shadows over
the concrete road

  down the road ever nearing him came a strange
caravan there were three horses tied to each other
on the backs of two were bundles and jugs of
water fastened stoutly but clumsily on the third
horse an old man rested in a chair-like saddle and at
this time he slept his chin resting on his chest his
hands clutching even in sleep the sides of the chair
leading the first horse walked a woman tall strong
lovely in her strength striding with easy pace along
the cement road on her back was slung a bow
with a quiver of arrows and in her right hand she
carried a heavy cane she walked on fearlessly
confidently she seemed filled with power confidence
and pride

  miller paused in the middle of the road the cara-

van came near him then it stopped in front of him

  well said the woman and her voice blended
curiously with the sunlit shadows and the flickering
leaves

  well who are you and why do you block our

way 

  why i am abraham miller and you are mar-
garctta heisler i am hunting for you your father
is safe and he sent me for you

  and you are a pedestrian

  just as truly as you are and so on and on-

  the professor woke from his nap he looked
down on the young man and woman standing talk-
ing already forgetting that there was anything else
in the world

  now that is the way it was in the old days
mused the professor to himself

  it was a sunday afternoon some hundred years
later a father and his little son were sightseeing
in the museum of natural sciences in the recon-
structed city of new york the whole city was
now simply a vast museum folks went there to
see it but no one wanted to live there in fact no
one wanted to live in such a place as a city when he
could live on a farm

  it was a part of every childs education to spend
a day or more in an automobilists city so on this
sunday afternoon the father and his little son walked
slowly through the large buildings they saw the
mastodon the bison the pterodactyl they paused
for some time before a glass case containing a wig-
wam of the american indian with a typical indian
family finally they came to a large wagon on four
rubber wheels but there was no shaft and no way
that horses or oxen could be harnessed to it in the
wagon on seats were men women and little children
the boy looked at them curiously and pulled at his
fathers sleeve

  look daddy what are that wagon and those
funny people without legs what does it mean
that my son is a family of automobilists and
there and then he paused and gave his son the little
talk that all pedestrian fathers are required by law
to give to their children

since i have grown up has become a mania with
me so much so in fact that even a simple exag-
geration made by my best of friends will driva me
frantic

  the average layman will best understand my
somewhat peculiar state of mind as far as truth is
concerned if i say that truth to me is nothing less
and nothing more than a hobby-a sort of sport
if you wish i collect truthful statements as one
might collect stamps particularly beautiful and
original examples of truth are written down by me
on large white cards these cards are all indexed
and classified and kept vertically filed in card files
the originator may i say inventor of these
truths is given full credit on these cards so that it
is easy to find years later who made this or that
particular truthful statement you will not think

me immodest if i state in 

passing that nine-tenths
of the cards bear my own
name as author of original
and surprising truths of
course since truth is a
science with me i realize
that such a statement can-
not cause much surprise

  i would not take up your
valuable time with state-
ments like the above were
it not so vitally important
to fully acquaint you with
my character for this
reason i also findit neces-
sary to give you the fol-
lowing references any of
the individuals and insti-
tutions mentioned below
will be very glad to vouch
for my integrity honesty
and veracity i could
give an almost infinite list
but i prefer mentioning
only the following

  hiram orourke law-
yer yankton mass

  the above defended me in three breach of-
promise suits as well as eight perjury charges of
which i was accused

  patrick flanagan jailkeeper yankton mass

  jeremiah addlecock jailkeeper coffeeville me

  mike whiffeltree jailkeeper lyreville vt

  the latter knew me intimately for only five
months

t his story originally appeared in a number of instal-
ments in  in the electrical experimenter a maga-
zine published by the publishers of amazing stories

   inasmuch as the former magazine had only a most
 limited circulation very few readers have seen the story
 tn print the author has made a number of minor cor-
 rections in preparing it for reprinting but the story in
 itself remains substantially the same as originally
 published

   at the time this story first appeared it was rather
 widely acclaimed by a number of newspapers which com-
 mented favorably on the extraordinary wealth of technical
 and scientific data scattered throughout the story

    the wireless telephone particularly has been exploited
 to a marked degree by the author although no commercial
 radio telephone was in existence at the time while the
 story in parts was zvritten in lighter strain it might be
 pointed out that the reason for this is that all of the
 original miinchhausen exploits were written in such vein
 it may be said at this point that baron miinchhausen
 actually lived having been born in hanover in  he
 was supposed to have been one of the most monumental
 liars even rivalling ananias in this respect his exploits
 have always been treated in lighter vein and many ver-
 sions of his adventures exist it is felt however that this
 does not necessarily detract from the effectiveness of the
 story and you willfind that it will hold your interest
 throughout

   the ulily barons adventures will be published during
 the next feiv months in instalments

  now that i have thoroughly established my stand-
ing i will proceed and i sincerely hope and trust
that no one will question any statements i may be
called to make in these pages they are the bare
unvarnished truth in each and every case if called
upon i will cheerfully swear to the truth of any of
my statements before a notary i am a notary
myself

 as every resident of my home town knows i
own the largest radio plant in the state i own the
only long distance radio telephone station in the
country as is known i hold the long distance radio
telephone record of the world even in  when
my set was not nearly as perfected as it is to-day i
could talk around the world and converse freely
with myself the message traveling clear around
the globe this fact was described at length in the
london scientific gazette of  see vol xx
no  page  it attracted much attention at the
time but it was declared commercially impractical
for the reason that it was argued it was not neces-
sary to build a giant wireless station at a tremendous
expense in order to talk clear around the globe to
listen to ones own voice one could talk to ones
self without the expensive radio my critics con-
tended that it would certainly be far less expensive
and perhaps more satisfactory

  this argument quite logical as it was for the time
being discouraged me not
a little but i soon took up
my studies anew and
made many important new
discoveries

 as president and foun-
der of the now defunct
american wireless mouse
trap co i learned a lot
about rats and mice and
this knowledge even to-
day is of high importance
to me

 the above company as
will be remembered by
many operated at one
time no less than -
 wireless mouse traps
all over the country if
we had not been so emi-
nently successful in kill-
ing every mouse and rat
in the country the com-
pany would no doubt still
have been in business as
it is the american public
calls me its greatest living
benefactor for ridding the
country of these pests and this alone is honor enough
for the benefit of my young readers who never
saw one of my wireless mouse traps let me give a
brief description

 each trap was constructed like a squirrel cage
the opening to the cage was fashioned in such a
manner that a mouse or rat could get into it but once
in could not of its own accord get out now as
--	 	  	 anyone knows mice and rats are exceedingly fond

  on account of the numerous inquiries received concerning r	 ti	 r  

me i suggest that you enclose a -ct stamp for your reply of evolving cages they will travel for miles to get
when writing	mto one it has a most powerful fascination for


amazing stories

them they simply adore it and go wild about it
i am almost tempted to say that they go crazy about
it for they find it extremely hard to stop once they
start running i based my invention upon this great
natural law

  the shaft of the cage was connected to a little
dynamo which was operated at high speed as soon
as the mouse or rat started the cage revolving the
dynamo in turn was connected to a little wireless
set and this in turn was connected to an aerial wire
system on the roof of the house the wireless set
was constructed in such a manner that when oper-
ated it would send out a call similar to a western
union call box in each locality we had a wireless
central with operators as soon as one of the
operators received a call he would look up his call
book and see where the call originated tffis took
only a few seconds a man would then be dis-
patched immediately to the house in question where
lie would brain the mouse or rat single handed on
the spot by means of a club he would next reset
the trap and return to headquarters giving a full
itemized report of the case to the inexperienced
my system of killing the rodents might appear rather
long-winded and expensive but this is just where
my insight into human nature came to the fore and
made me famous

  not everybody likes to kill rats and mice this
is particularly true of the feminine humans inhabita-
ting this globe why this should be so  do not pro-
fess to know although i have some vague opinions
on the subject which however i would rather keep
to myself what therefore was more natural than
to employ professional ratters and mousers to per-
form the disagreeable tasks in any event the com-
pany was a huge success and many a fair damsel
even to-day sends me highly perfumed letters hail-
ing me as the annihilator of the arch-enemies of the
fairer sex

  but i digress from my story as i said before i
own the largest radio telephone station in the country
it is exceedingly well appointed and contains instru-
ments and apparatus of which the greatest living
scientists have as yet not the faintest knowledge

  this story starts on a bitter cold december night
i could go to some length and write two or three
columns at ten cents a word stating how the wind
sang weirdly through my aerial wires on the roof
how the flames of my log fire cast fantastic shadows
about the room how my cat was softly purring on
a chair near by dreaming of some long departed
appetizing canary how the windows rattled uncan-
nily in the storm how the trees moaned plaintively
outside and so forth thus i could set the scene
and prepare you for the story-getting you under
tension as the editor calls it technically

  as a plain matter of fact however the aerial wires
were full of sleet and therefore could not sing
furthermore i was glad that they didnt come down
for that would have caused hardly pleasant music
then the log fire too could not very well have cast
fantastic shadows or any other shadows for that
matter because the log fire happened to be a radiator
instead of casting fantastic shadows however it
cast about a lot of rank noise and every now and
then made me jump clean out of my chair nor
could the cat have purred very readily on the chair
because to begin with it wasnt a cat at all but a dog
and he could not have purred even if he had taken
lessons at  an hour there were good reasons for

this too firstly it was not a he it was a she
secondly she had been dead for two years and only
because she was stuffed so nicely did i keep her
thirdly she could positively not have sat on a chair
near by simply because there was only one chair in
the place and  was on it fourthly dogs especially
dead dogs are not known to dream about appetizing
canary birds then too no windows could have
rattled in the storm for my radio station is in the
cellar and that cellar has no windows whatsoever
as for the trees moaning plaintively or otherwise i
explained above that my people were engaged in
cactus farming there are no trees on such-a farm
and cactus positively does not moan in a storm it
squeaks

now that you understand the situation fully i
will proceed it was after  oclock midnight
on a cold winter night my new loud-talking tele-
phone receivers were on my head and i had just lit a
fresh pipe i had been flirting with my vario-selec-
tive coupling-balance which was adjusted to a very
long wavelength- meters if my memory
serves me right-and i was just in the act of tuning
down to the wave length of fl-thats the paris
eiffel tower station suddenly a very faint but
exceedingly high pitched screaming sound came
through my receivers becoming louder and louder
each second while i was still wondering what this
unearthly sound could be i heard in a faint but
clear voice

  alier yankton mpss- meters this
sentence was repeated several times i lost no time in
starting my  kilowatt generator tuned up to
 meters and yelled into the transmitter in
front of me

  ship ahoy this is alier of yankton whos
there  almost instantly it came

  it is i hieronymus karl friedrich baron
munchhatisen   

  at that i almost swallowed my pipe but just the
same the colossal nerve of that fellow aggravated
me

  you confounded liar stop your joking i yelled
back if you have anything to say say it and be
quick about it for i am going to bed in a few
minutes

  my son it came back in sepulchral tones i am
not at all surprised at your astonishment rest as-
sured i expected you to doubt my identity how-
ever i have proofs it is now  a m terrestrial
time kindly mount to the top of your roof you
will find it to be a clear night with a half full moon
in the sky take your watch along and observe the
moon carefully precisely at  a m i will illuminate
the dark half portion of the moon with a red phos-
phorescence i will do this three times beginning at
 a m each illumination to last five seconds with a
-second interval between each illumination after
this return to your phones i have spoken   

  the peculiar high pitched screaming sound was
heard once more in my receivers it ran rapidly
down the scale became fainter and fainter-there
was a low click in my phones and everything was
quiet

  i must have sat dumbfounded for at least a minute
before i could collect my senses i took the phones
off my head and wiped off the perspiration mechanic-
ally i am sure i was dazed i looked at my hands
moving them back and forth before my eyes but i
baron munciiiiausen



wasnt certain then that i was awake so i took a
pin lying nearby and shoved it into my thigh i
knew then that i was really awake i wanted to
think but i had to laugh outright why the thing
was preposterous some practical radio amateur
joker no doubt who tried to get me on the roof
and then afterward make me the laughing stock of
the town

  good stunt rather novel idea ha ha   
but that sepulchral earnest voice that distinct ac-
cent the peculiar intonation    could it    

  my eyes fell on the clock before me it was
 at that very moment my phones emitted a
loud crackling sound like static before a thunder-
storm as i looked on wondering the receivers
suddenly became enveloped in a scarlet phosphor-
escence glowing softly like the light in ai x-ray
tube

  i know now that my hair must have stood up at
the sight of this uncanny phenomenon i recollect
that i grabbed my cap and ran up the stairs knock-
ing somebody down as  flew by pushed the trap
open and sank down on the roof almost exhausted
mechanically i pulled out my watch it was 
 shivered and looked intently at the moon sailing in
a beautifully clear sky in which the stars sparkled
with unusual brilliancy

  the moon was half full the dark half being jet
black and undistinguishable from the black sky a
clock nearby started to strike  oclock the sound
was still vibrating in the air when i witnessed a most
remarkable phenomenon the dark portion of the
moon was suddenly faintly illuminated with the same
scarlet phosphorescence which i had seen only a few
seconds earlier around my receivers

  it seemed to me as if there were a gigantic
searchlight stationed on the bright side of the moon
throwing a colossal shaft of that scarlet light over
on the dark side this shaft of light was not sta-
tionary it swept rapidly back and forward over the
dark face of the moon illuminating the moons
craters in a wonderful fashion the phosphorescent
light shaft was so long that it actually went clear
across the face of the moon and swept out into the
space beyond for a considerable distance it was the
most magnificent inspiring spectacle i had ever wit-
nessed in my life suddenly the light vanished for
a short period just as the mysterious person had said
it would  counted to  just as suddenly the
sweeping light shaft reappeared brushing the moons
dark face backward and forward several times as
before the light disappeared again i counted to
 and it reappeared going through the identical mo-
tions for the third and last time

  for a few seconds i stood fascinated probably
with my mouth wide open like one in a trance i
went down to the radio and i still remember that
my teeth chattered violently and that i had a cold
chill which shook me from head to foot while i ad-
justed the phones over my head

  t had scarcely finished when the high pitched
screaming sound was heard again and in a few sec-
onds the voice with the graveyard tone spoke once
more

  i trust my boy that you will not again doubt
baron munchhausens word here i could dis-
tinguish a low chuckle but tell me how did you
like my little exhibition 

  why your excellency i stammered into the
transmitter before me i really had no idea of

offending you before the whole thing seemed so im-
possible to me that you can hardly blame me for
doubting you however after seeing your wonder-
ful lunar fireworks i stand ready to believe anything
and everything that you may say i assure you 
will swear by it but would you be so kind as to an-
swer the burning question which is uppermost in my
mind just now am i not correct in my assumption
that your excellency was born in hanover germany
in  and was buried in  in the same locality

  most assuredly my boy you have stated the facts
correctly as you say i was buried in  but if
you were to open the coffin to-day you would not
find the bones of baron munchhausen for political
reasons it was very desirable for me to die in
 if i had not died just then i would have
been hanged no doubt so i had a wax replica of
myself made which resembled me so closely that it
even deceived my trusted valet fritz who came
within an ace of placing me in the coffin while i was
sleeping peacefully but soundly in a secret room in
my attic if i had not sneezed in my sleep un-
doubtedly they would have buried me and let my
wax replica shift for itself in an unfriendly world
while this might have been a regrettable accident
it would hardly have affected me much for i am im-
mortal as you no doubt know a chuckle was
discerned by me at this pun the baron no doubt
liked his own little joke

  however in the absence of fritz that blunderer
rosskopf the embalmer entered the house very
much under the influence of schnapps and by pure
chance found the secret room he saw me sleeping
soundly and thought of course that i was dead
either because he was too lazy or else too drunk i
never knew which he did not cut me open and em-
balm me in the usual manner luckily for me in-
stead he used a hollow needle and injected the em-
balming fluid into my veins i am a sound sleeper
a very sound sleeper so i did not wake for a long
time as time goes a very long time indeed to
be accurate i did not wake up for  years the
embalming fluid that rosskopf used on me was ap-
parently a good brand for it did not- wear out for
 years i e till a d  it seems that this
embalming fluid made my body rigid and stiff as
stone and to all intents and purposes unknown to
me i was as dead as my wax replica which they had
buried the same afternoon however it seems my
heart continued to beat faintly through all these years
and the prolonged rest instead of aging my body
really made me younger although technically i am
to-day almost  years old i feel no older than 
you see what a good rest does the next thing i
knew was when i finally woke up and sneezed about
 times i was still on my bed in my secret room

  you ask how that can be possible simplicity
itself only fritz and i knew of the secret room
rosskopf the embalmer when he became sober
again had promptly forgotten all about it of course
so he really did not know any more than anyone else

  as i found out afterward this is what happened 
fritz my trusted valet had gone over to the burial
vault to lock up the heavy oak door but the door
must have snapped shut while he was inside the
vault as i lived alone with him there was no one
to release him he naturally thought i would miss
him in time when i would of course come to free
him i did-in time- years later poor fel-
low i cried a bit when i saw his bones


amazing stories

  but to go back i said i woke up trying to sneeze
my head off for a few minutes i could see noth-
ing for the dust i made while sneezing i got up and
felt rather stiff and as hungry as a bear i opened
the window and looked out the strange sights i
saw fairly made me dizzy it took me some hours
to get used to it all to make a long story short it
finally dawned on me that i must have slept for
many years in the afternoon i cautiously walked
down and inspected the house which looked to me
the same as on the day i went to sleep i then ven-
tured out into the neglected unkempt garden and
after satisfying my hunger by means of a few dozen
pears i sat down on a decaying bench to think about
the strange situation while i pondered thus i
noticed a sheet of printed paper on the ground it
proved to be a part of a recent hanoverian newspa-
per i picked it up casually and tried to read the
somewhat unfamiliar type suddenly i saw the date
september   it was then-for the first time
in my life-that i fainted dead away the shock was
too great

  but your time is limited my dear boy so i will
make the story short suffice it to say that just as
soon as i came to i went over to the city hall and
explained the whole affair to the herr burgermeister
-our mayor i had no trouble in proving my iden-
tity and the dear fellow overwhelmed me with kind-

ness he feted and dined me and insisted that the
town of hanover should give a fitting celebration in
my honor this however i declined modestly dur-
ing the course of the dinner he told me that due to
all good traditions of german official red tape my
house and estate were still in the process of liquida-
tion as i had neglected to leave a will i filed my
will that very day and my lawyers assured me that
as i could prove my identity without doubt i should
be able to inherit my own estate within at least 
years they further assured me that i need have
no misgivings as to my political offenses which i
committed  years ago they argued that these
offenses had been outlawed that took a big load off
my mind well i guess weve chatted long enough
for to-day besides my power is getting low   

  but your excellency i shouted back into my
transmitter breathlessly wont you please explain
how you come to be on such an outlandish place as
the moon and if you are there how you can exist
for there is certainly no atmosphere on the moon
and the temperature is below zero  

   i would gladly tell you all this now but it takes
time to explain these things the sound came back
very weak and distant but as i said before my
power is getting low so if you will be at your
phones to-morrow night at  p m terrestrial time
i will gladly satisfy your curiosity good night

ii	how muenchhausen and the allies took berlin

i confess that i put in a bad night after my
first radio telephone talk with the baron on that
memorable december night my dreams were
wild and fearsome and i awoke at frequent inter-
vals bathed in perspiration the whole thing was so
uncanny so preposterous that when i finally opened
my eyes the next morning i began to wonder if the
whole thing had not been a wild extravagant dream

  as yet i had not told anyone about munchhausen
for fear of inevitable ridicule so by noontime i had
become thoroughly convinced that i had dreamed
the whole thing from beginning to end but when
i sat down to lunch and my elder brother asked me
why i had knocked him down on the stairs on his
return from the lodge the night before i knew that
the episode was not a dream after all so i told my
people of my experience and recited my conversa-
tion with mr munchhausen they did not wax en-
thusiastic as the story proceeded instead when i
finished my father took a deep breath gave me a
queer look and tapped his forehead with his index
finger that was the extent of his comment he
then gave vent to a disgusted snort and started with
the soup

  my younger brother sang to the tune of apple-
blossom time in normandy

  when the nuts are getting ripe in squirreltown
my older brother remarked casually that he had
read not so long ago about an eminent eastern doc-
tor who found that strong radio waves had the
peculiar property of producing little explosions in-
side of the brain a coherer action as it were
this he said produced what the doctor termed a
wireless brainstorm

  a rather dangerous disease closely resembling
hydrophobia my brother remarked before attacking
his stew

  the rest of my family all made similar intelligent

comments and as the case proved hopeless i kept
quiet and said nothing

  that evening however shortly before  oclock
i summoned the yawning obstreperous members of
my family to the radio room and fitted everyone with
a radio telephone headset these headsets were con-
nected to my own trusty receivers i then told my
little audience to watch the clock and be prepared to
listen to the most remarkable discourse ever held
between two humans nor did i disappoint my
audience the clock had hardly finished striking the
eleventh hour when the to me familiar high-
pitched screaming sound was heard again and a few
seconds later munchhausens voice vibrated power-
fully into our receivers

  good evening my son he said in his sepulchral
voice i trust you have had pleasant dreams and
that last nights experience has not disturbed you too
much

  i hastened to reply that i was doing nicely but
that i found it difficult to persuade my doubting
thomases that his excellency had really come back
to life at this munchhausen laughed heartily and
said that he had expected as much he added that
if further proofs were wanted he would be happy to
give another lunar exhibition he volunteered in
addition to sweep the moons dark quarter this very
night with any color we desired in order to convince
even the most skeptical that his return was not a
hoax i could tell by the faces of my hearers that
they were beginning to become impressed a vote
of the audience held right then and there deter-
mined the color to be green i transmitted this in-
telligence to the baron at once whereupon he
promised to light up the invisible dark quarter of the
moon in a green phosphorescence for the duration
of  seconds beginning at  p m he added
baron munchhausen

in less than one second over  men were baled together tighter than a bale of compressed cotton-and as helpless

that our conversation was to be resumed after the
performance

  we thereupon repaired to the roof of the house
everybody keyed to the highest excitement

   i will not go into lengthy details suffice it to say
that true to his word at exactly  p m miinch-
hausen swept the dark part of the moons surface
with an immense shaft of a green phosphorescence
similar to the exhibition he had given fdr me the
night before if anything the light shaft was more
powerful this however might have been due to the
earths atmosphere being clearer than on the pre-
vious night

   need not go to the trouble of explaining that
every one of my family was thoroughly convinced
all were silent and awe-struck and all were as ready
as i was to believe anything that miinchhausen might
say and i assure you i was thoroughly convinced

  after the exhibition we resumed our seats in the
radio room and i suggested that my brother take
stenographic notes of the conversation-he was an
expert stenographer and had been a reporter on the
new york times for five years

  i may add therefore that all conversations be-
tween baron miinchhausen and myself which i
shall publish hereafter are exactly as stated taken
from my brothers stenographic reports the original
notes are open to anyone who doubts their truth

  after we were all seated again and the excitement
had cooled down somewhat i started my generator
tuned to  meters wave length and spoke into
the transmitter before me

  your excellency are you there

  yes indeed my dear boy it came back in en
couraging tones now i suppose i will be bom-
barded with -centimeter questions for the rest of
the evening what let it be known therefore
that baron miinchhausen is as usual ready for all
emergencies pray proceed

  thank you indeed i responded gratefully
you are taking a load off my mind for i certainly
have a number of questions to ask you my first
question most naturally is how came you to select
me to talk to

  for two reasons first i knew you to be a truth-
ful individual just as i am far-famed and known
to be so in your country the second reason is that
i could hear your radio signals right here on the
moon proving to me that you were probably the
only one with whom i might converse on earth
my judgment as usual proved correct

  thank you for the compliment i replied now
for my most important question how on earth
did you ever land on the moon and why 

  the baron laughed outright at my pun and pro-
ceeded 

  thats a rather long-winded story but i will try
to tell you

  as i said last night when i came back to life i
found myself in my old secret room after my visit
to the mayor i returned to this room and proceeded
to remove my treasure of  gold ducats which
i had intended to take with me on my contemplated
secret flight  years ago it seems that instinct
prompted me to exchange this currency for paper
money at a local bank that very day a lucky thing


amazing stories

for me as you will see shortly you will believe me
when i state that i slept easier that night with those

	ducats exchanged into modern thousand
mark bills tucked away securely in my ancient wal-
let under my pillow

   but your excellency i broke in did you not
say a minute ago that there were but  ducats 
h-m thats correct chuckled the baron but
my dear boy you seem to forget entirely that gold
ducats of the vintage of  sell at a very high
premium to-day on account of the great scarcity of
these coins as a matter of fact if i had peddled
these coins to coin dealers and private coin collectors
i have not the least doubt but that i could have
realized a great deal more

   well the next morning i was awakened by a
fearful racket it seems that word had graveled
around that i came back to life and my enthusiastic
townspeople were bent on celebrating my return in
a befitting manner there were about ten brass
bands in front of my house and i estimate that at
least three-quarters of the population were assembled
around the bands waiting to see me i dressed hur-
riedly and stepped out on the balcony greeted with
deafening hochs vivat muenchhausen and lang
soli er leben then someone yelled for a speech to
which i responded delivering an appropriate address
for the occasion i had hardly finished when two
ladders were leaned against my balcony and two en-
thused corps studenteri had carried me bodily
down into a gala automobile bedecked gaily with
bunting one of the students in full dress took his
seat at the steering wheel while ten others also in
full dress started to pull the automobile in a tri-
umphant entry through the city

   it was indeed a strange cortege and you will
find a full report of it in the german daily press of
september the th  the town was decorated
with flags from end to end in a most elaborate
manner and after a wonderful day full of speeches
and all kinds of honors bestowed upon me the day
was closgd with a tremendous illumination and ex-
quisite fireworks the next few days were crowded
with hundreds of interviews with reporters and with
private individuals while attention and kindness were
showered over me unendingly i tried hard to ab-
sorb all the new customs and i had to ask numerous
questions in order to become acquainted with all the
strange things i met at every hand as usual my
well-known versatility carried me through every-
thing successfully and it took me less than a week
of concentrated study to become a fully-up-to-date
man

   there was only one point on which i remained
obdurate this was my attire i refused to clothe
myself in modern clothes i refused to put my be-
loved lower extremities into those foolish modern
overgrown sleeves which you call trousers nor could
i see a single good reason for wearing those unsightly
sacks which you call coats neither did close-crop-
ped hair which destroys the individuality of man
appeal to me in the least nor for that matter those
fantastic straw-stalk dishes which you call straw hats
accordingly i stuck to my style of dressing although
i confess i had considerable difficulty in finding a
tailor and a hatter who could accommodate me

   alas my triumph was short lived i have al-
ready told you that before i began my century-long
sleep i had committed a certain political offense
against the then reigning authorities you would

naturally think that after a lapse of  years al-
most any kind of political offense would be forgot-
ten and outlawed not so in my dear fatherland
in germany a political offense is worse than a thou-
sand murders official germany or rather prussia
knows no time limit when it concerns lose majeste
lo make a painful story short one nice autumn
morning i was awakened roughly with this pleasant
remark

    i arrest you in the name of the king know-
ing me as a resourceful character the authorities had
sent no less than six well-armed polisisten to make
sure i would not break away

   i was forced to dress in a hurry and before i
knew it i had been placed in the green wagon and
hustled to the local jail there to await trial for my
political wrongs committed  years ago so does
prussia treat its famous men lucky for me that
i carried my money in the folds of my high boots
for if i had not it certainly would have been found
so you see ancient dress has its advantages

   i stayed in that prison for two days and i con-
fess that i do not know what would have become of
me had it not been for my many sympathizers and
admirers to the german peoples fair-mindedness
distinguished from german officialdom i owe my re-
lease for at the end of two days in the middle of
the night some  masked young men all admirers
of mine rushed into the prison and overpowered the
keepers and attendants and i was put in a large
automobile and rushed away in the dead of a moon-
less night i was quickly conducted to a small town
where i lived in disguise for some weeks

   subsequently i made my way to the dutch fron-
tier where i breathed easier for i knew that there
i was safe from all danger the next day found me
in paris where i settled down in one of the suburbs
with deep bitterness in my heart against official as
well as officious prussia

 for the next few years i traveled extensively in
europe and america as well as the rest of the world
with the exception of germany in the course of
my travels i had a great many adventures which i
hope i will have the pleasure to relate to you in the
near future returning to paris in  my mind
which had always been of a scientific bend turned
to the study of electricity and chemistry as well as
of general physics and in a short time  had made
hundreds of wonderful discoveries not believing
in patents especially in france with her antiquated
patent laws i patented none of my inventions
some day i hope to publish all of themforthe bene-
fit of humanity

hphe outbreak of the great war of  found

   jl me in the midst of the study of several new in-
ventions which i was trying to perfect neverthe-
less i welcomed the war with a glad heart here at
last was my long hoped for chance to get even with
prussia against whom i had nursed a growing hatred
during the past few years my revanche was at
hand

   the war had not been in progress for two days
when i received an urgent call from my friend presi-
dent poincare of the french republic i called at
the palace at once and was greeted cordially by the
president who shook me warmly by the hand only
one other person was present namely general joffre
chief of the french army whom i had known inti-
mately for the past few years he also welcomed
baron munchhausen



me and patted me affectionately on the back i
could see by the expression on their faces that some
very serious business was to be transacted and i was
not mistaken

   monsieur le baron the president began in a
businesslike manner from our past acquaintance i
know you to be on our side despite the fact that you
are born a prussian am i correct in my assump-
tion 

   yes monsieur le president i replied fervently
it was my misfortune to have been born in prussia
but i assure you that there is to-day no more ardent
patriotic frenchman in france than myself down
with the tyrant prussia

  tres bien the president replied gratified i
will have you sworn in at noon to-day as i know
that you have made certain far-reaching inventions
i trust that you will do your utmost to turn thee to
the benefit of our great republic any assistance
which you might require will be given to you by the
government and you will co-operate with general
joffre to destroy the enemy

   the french general staff has already decided
to invade germany by way of alsace in order to
regain our lost provinces your efforts therefore
should be confined to that territory until your pres-
ence is required elsewhere

  i thanked the president profusely for his great
confidence in me and hastened to assure him that i
would not rest till the enemy was destroyed i made
it a condition however that i should have the power
of requisitioning anything no matter what it might
prove to be if in my opinion it was essential to use
at the front this president poincare promised
gladly

   all the government desires just now he closed
are results and victories over the enemy france is
at your service with these words we shook hands
solemnly and the president left me alone with gen-
eral joffre

  for several hours joffre and i discussed various
phases of the war and after i had thoroughly ac-
quainted him with some of my revolutionary plans of
warfare we parted in high spirits

  that very night i requisitioned every tank of
laughing gas as well as every carboy of chloroform
in the whole of france i furthermore ordered every
factory producing these articles to work overtime for
 hours each day until further notice immediately
thereupon i requisitioned an immense factory at
levallois-perret a suburb of paris where for the
next few days i kept  people busy manufactur-
ing my requirements

  you know of course of the french invasion
into alsace at the beginning of the war and how we
penetrated even beyond mulhausen and kolman but
did you know how it was accomplished and by
whom  i think not when history is finally written
you will find that it was i who made the difficult
work possible i personally conducted the invasion
and it was indeed a brilliant success the first
clash with the germans was spectacular we rushed
upon them in the early morning but instead of our
artillery using the ordinary explosive shells we used
my compressed laughing gas cylinders these were
constructed in such a way that they would open upon
striking the ground the soldiers of the rank and
file were equipped with a similar device and instead
of shooting bullets they shot compressed laughing
gas cylinders these cylinders were shot from the

rifle at a rather close range and were not supposed to
penetrate the bodies of the enomy instead the
cylinders had a short rubber nose which upon strik-
ing actuated a trigger and this in turn opened the
forward end of the cylinder releasing the gas

  our first attack proved as great an astonishment
to us as to the enemy when we began shooting the
laughing gas at the oncoming ferocious-looking ger-
mans their expressions changed suddenly to abomi-
nable grins most of them reeled and dropped right
in their tracks we had but to pick them up after-
ward as prisoners in a single day we thus captured

	germans

  after the first rush we drove them back to their
second line of trenches and it was here that my
chloroform bombs did wonderful work our artil-
lery began shelling the trenches with my bombs
these on striking the ground liberated the com-
pressed chloroform with disastrous results to the
enemy we literally drenched the germans with
chloroform and those who were not killed outright
were picked up later to be sent to france as prisoners
there they were put to work at manufacturing more
laughing gas and chloroform with which to capture
their countrymen

  thus we fought our way to mulhausen which
we soon occupied triumphantly i have no doubt but
that i would have fought my way across the rhine
but just then joffre got into trouble in belgium and
retreated into france on his urgent representation
i rushed to his aid leaving my eastern army in the
hands of a young general whom i thought capable
of continuing our alsatian invasion

  unluckily the germans got wise to my bombs
and began using some form of diving helmets fast-
ened over the heads which kept the fumes and gases
from their noses and mouths this of course coun-
teracted my bombs and made them obsolete the
germans subsequently appeared in great force and
practically drove my alsatian invading army from
alsace finally leaving it entrenched in the vosges

  in the meanwhile general joffre had retreated
almost to paris before i could rush assistance to him
i am proud to state here that had it not been for me
paris as well as the rest of france would have been
in german hands

  but germany had not included miinchhausen in
her plans of invasion

  the great german general von kluck was but
a few miles from paris when i went into action
why he did not take paris at that time and why he
retreated so mysteriously and with so much haste
beyond the rivers marne and somme has been a
deep mystery to many people for a long time the
explanation is found in the one word  miinchhausen
i had long since discovered that the german advance
could not be stopped by ordinary means so i adopted
extraordinary measures

  as is well known france had been poorly pre-
pared for the war while there were unlimited
stores of powder and gun-cotton the artillery was
sadly deficient in shells and our soldiers lacked bul-
lets as the manufacture of these important items
is rather slow work i commandeered all the french
arsenals to turn out immediately rock salt shells and
cartridges which instead of having bullets at their
business ends were filled with a goodly charge of
the inexpensive as well as plentiful rock salt

  from the minute these salties as they were
affectionately called by the french army came into


amazing stories

use the german advance had come to an end we
simply shot salt at the germans

  you may laugh at this and ask how it could pos-
sibly have stopped them but the answer is as simple
as it is surprising the rock salt when shot from
a rifle or gun had not enough piercing power to
penetrate the bodies of the enemy but it went easily
clean through the soldiers uniforms and then buried
itself under their skins

  if you have ever had a salty solution applied to
an open wound you will appreciate what happened
when i began pumping rock salt into the imperial
german army no sooner had a soldier been shot
than he would throw up both hands and begin to
scratch himself furiously with a zeal with which you
would hardly credit the slow-moving germans
orders or no orders from his officers hans would
scratch himself for dear life to get some refief from
the fearful itching finding that this did not bring
the desired relief instinct prompted him to run for
the nearest water supply in order to wash the slight
wounds free of the salt

  by that time our gallant frenchmen or british
were upon them and they were made prisoners in
less time than it takes to describe it it was several
days before the german general staff got onto
my latest device but then they promptly set out to
checkmate me one morning i received a report
that my rock salt charges no longer acted in the usual
prescribed manner i e the germans refused to
scratch themselves when shot at instead they
threatened to drive us back that afternoon we
caught a few germans and the mystery was solved

  the foxy german general staff had ordered each
soldier to wear two uniforms one put on top of
the other our rock salt charges could easily pene-
trate one uniform but not two therefore i was
forced to abandon my salties and i turned my
fertile brain in new directions

  in a few days i was back to the front with a
brand-new device i am proud to say that of all
schemes this one was probably the most effective
with its help we captured no less than  ger-
mans in less than one week president poincare
personally attached the cross of the legion dhonneur
to my breast with the official thanks of the republic
i am immensely proud of it to-day

  as you will have noticed all my own devices of
modern warfare are exceedingly humane if i can
possibly avoid it t do not allow blood to be shed i
believe in taking the enemy alive

  my well-known success the human self-binder
illustrates this point

  you are of course acquainted with the self-
binder as used in harvesting you know how the
machine bales the wheat putting a stout cord around
the circumference of the bundle and holding the
stalks securely together

  this is the principle used in my human self-
binder it is simplicity itself and works as follows

  two of the famous french -millimeter guns
were placed about  meters apart from each other
facing the oncoming enemy the guns were loaded
in the usual manner except that the shells were
equipped with an eye-ring at the end facing the
enemy to this ring was fastened securely a strong
but flexible steel cable about as thick as your little
finger before firing the cable would run into the
mouth of the first cannon while the other end of the
cable was fastened to a similar shell in the second

cannon  meters distant then the two guns were
adjusted in such a manner that the cable was almost
taut the cannons themselves were leveled nearly
parallel to the ground when the command was
given the two cannons were fired simultaneously by
means of electricity the result was fearful when
we first tried it on a regiment of charging germans
the two shells leaped forward together from the
cannons carrying the steel cable with them now
stretched taut the cable cutting through the air at
a tremendous rate of speed made a frightful
screeching noise it sang so loudly that it was
easily heard over a distance of  miles it was
awe-inspiring

  have you ever as a child swung a cord with a
stone at one end if you have you will remember
how the string sung louder and higher in pitch as
you increased its speed so it was with the steel
cable only the sound was increased a few billion
times over that of your string it went somewhat
like this

whheeeeeeeee eeee-eee-eee eeee-eee-eee-eee

  the two shells then plowed their way through a
few dozen soldiers while the cable catching the fore-
most men amidships as it were was stopped short
and the shells carried forward by their momentum
continued to travel in their forward movement until
they were stopped short by the cable but the mo-
mentum then carried one shell around to the left
while the other went to the right in less than one
second over  men were baled together tighter
than a bale of compressed cotton and as hopeless
most of the men at the point of contact with the
cable were of course crushed to death by the tre-
mendous pressure but those on the inside while
nearly all of the breath had left them for the time
being were alive and were easily made prisoners
by us

  you have probably often wondered why after the
retreat of the marne the germanadug themselves
into their famous trenches the answer is that this
was the only means of escape from my human baler
as soon as they had found that they could not rush
at us over the open terrain they went into their
trenches which naturally put my self-binder hors de
combat or out of business as americans are fond
of saying

  this put me at my wits end-but not for very
long at the end of october  when all efforts
to oust the germans from their trenches had failed
i went to see general joffre and said to him

   my dear general we must now resort to a more
novel means than ever to crush the enemy here is
my plan the allies are now spending untold mil-
lions cach day and no headway is being made against
the germans why not take  picked men
who know how to dig and mine and order them to
build a few gigantic tunnels right under the ger-
man trenches emerging in some forests miles behind
the german lines  upon a given signal our armies
could break through the openings and while half of
our men would fall into the enemys back the other
half would be well on the road to berlin simple
is it not 

  general joffres enthusiasm over my plan knew
no bounds this otherwise silent man threw his
arms around my neck and embraced me while tears
of gratitude ran down his ruddy cheeks we then
discussed the details and next morning we put the
baron munchhausen

t

 

whole plan before the government the president
and his cabinet general sir john french of the
british army as well as king albert of the belgian
army were even more enthusiastic than joff re had
been and a vote was passed immediately authorizing
me to go ahead with the work

  so cautiously did we proceed that no german
spy ever got wind of the great scheme no suspicious
character was allowed to come within  miles of the
tunnel openings and as the latter were cunningly
started under large railroad sheds airplanes of the
enemy never suspected what was going on beneath

   there were four large tunnels all told the first
started at a point near pont-a-moussqn ending in
the forest of la fourasse another one started not
far from verdun and ended in the forest of the
argonne no blasting or dynamite was used for
fear of arousing the suspicions of the germans over-
head  each tunnel was large enough to enable 
men to march abreast in it upright

  at the end of december  we had over -

	men at work on the four tunnels and by febru-
ary   they were completed except for a few
yards at the far end during that night the entire
french as well as british and belgian armies walked
into the tunnels-men horses automobiles artillery
and all we had burned our bridges behind us
everything was staked on the grand coup

  a small opening was then carefully made at the
end of each tunnel and one of our men cautiously
emerged through each small hole each of the four
reported the forests quiet whereupon our sappers
quickly broke out a large opening within one hour
our armies began to dcbouchc from the tunnels and
by morning the four units had marched out of the
four forests one-half of the armies were to fall
into the backs of the germans and the other half
were to march on berlin i was with the latter
highly elated at our success wc immediately seized
all railways and roads and our advance began

  there was only one thing which disturbed us
by night we were informed that the other half of
our legions which were to fall into the back of the
enemy had failed to find a single german soldier
neither joffre nor i could understand this but the
next morning we had the glad tidings that our army
had taken some  prisoners and that not a single
german remained joffre and i naturally reasoned
that the germans had held their western trenches
largely by bluff while their real army consisting of
several million soldiers had been thrown against the
russians to hold the latter back from east prussia
and their new invasion of hungary

  we therefore pressed forward with great speed
using germanys wonderful strategic railroad system
for the main advance

  on february  our allied armies had crossed
the rhine at cologne koblenz and mayence on
february  we crossed the weser and on february
 we entered berlin triumphantly without firing a
shot it was almost too good to be true but more
work lay ahead of us our mission was only half
filled we had not as yet conquered the main ger-
man and austrian armies which we knew to be on
the eastern frontier and no victory can be complete
as long as a powerful army remains in the field
accordingly we began pressing forward again when
we were dealt a most terrible blow

  we received the awful intelligence from our
army which we had left behind in order to patrol

the conquered territory that one and one-half mil-
lion germans were rushing on us with forced
marches from france

  we were dumbfounded was it a trick or a
hoax 

  alas it was neither i will not bore you to
death with a most unfortunate heart-rending tale
this is what happened

  some german had hit upon the same idea as i
had but instead of boring four tunnels they bored
two that was the only difference while we
thought we emerged behind their backs they thought
they were doing the same thing in reference to us
by a strange coincidence they marched out of their
tunnels during the same night that we marched out
of ours and while we captured berlin they captured
paris and then bordeaux

  not finding our armies which they thought had
retreated into the interior they feared a trick and
rushed back till they came upon the other half of our
army stationed along the rhine then they knew
the truth

  a curious state of affairs had arisen in this ter-
i ible mix-up

  we held germany and a part of austria while
the germans held nearly all of france neither of
us had gained any advantage so we called a truce and
agreed to trade back our present trenches for our
former ones while they agreed to take back theirs

  for this reason march   found us in exact-
ly the same position we had left on february  
with the difference that for two days the kaiser had
been in paris while joffre and i had been in berlin

  i immediately fell into disgrace with the allies
and i thought it best to take myself out of the way
which i did

baron munchhausen took a long breath
at this juncture so i commented

  this is certainly a most remarkable story but
my dear baron how is it possible that we have never
heard a single word about this momentous phase of
the war no newspaper ever mentioned a word
about it to the best of my knowledge plow tan you
explain that

  my dear boy munchhausen replied wearily
evidently you were not in europe during the war
the explanation lies in the one word censorship
the allies while marching on berlin allowed no
news to leave the country for fear that the german
and austrian armies at the russian frontier would
get it too early

  but your excellency i broke in how could
that have helped you while you advanced from
town to town in germany the germans certainly
must have had plenty of time to send word ahead
by telegraph to their armies at the russian frontier
that the allies were advancing on berlin this
doesnt look right somehow

  baron munchhausen chuckled softly for some
time before he replied

  ah my boy i knew you would ask this so i
kept it until the last the failure of the germans in
the east to receive news of our invasion was en-
tirely due to a brilliant ruse of mine studied out long
before our entry into germany like all my suc-
cesses this one was the simplest of them all ridicu-
lously simple i must laugh every time i think
of it

  you see when the allies emerged from the for-


amazing stories

ests that night they were all of them down to the
last soldier allircd in german uniforms

  as large bodies of german soldiers were thrown
back and forward over the great german railroad
system so often during the war no one thought any-
thing of our invasion thinking us germans all the
while as a matter of fact over  per cent of the
german population never knew that the allies had
invaded germany and austria until we were back
in our own trenches in northern france and
flanders

  here munchhausen indulged in an uproarious
laugh before he proceeded

  the fortresses which we encountered had so few
men that we did not even bother to take them had
the defenders found out during our advance on
berlin that we were not their compatriots they
would have been powerless as their numbers were
pitifully small compared with the immense armies
of the allies as we had naturally taken charge of
all the telegraph and telephone lines immediately
upon emerging from our forests we sent fake war
reports from berlin all day long purporting to come
from the front the deception could not have been
more complete so you can readily see that all the
news which the nauen wireless plant sent out broad-
cast each day over the entire world during the month
of march was nothing but a hoax manufactured
expressly for it by our own general staff

  i was so stunned by this revelation that i sat
speechless for a few seconds but i collected my
thoughts suddenly and demanded

  that is all good and well as far as it goes but
what about the german army in france my dear
baron how could over a million germans have
taken paris and bordeaux without the outside world
hearing about it

  i thought surely that i had cornered munchhausen
that time but he merely gave a deep sigh and said
sadly

  alas great minds always run in the same chan-
nels that german who thought of digging the
tunnels underneath our troops also thought of put-
ting his soldiers into french and british uniforms

  so you see he german masqueraded armies
fooled the french population precisely in the same
manner as i fooled the german people with mine
there are thousands of french even to-day who
have not the slightest knowledge that paris or bor-
deaux had actually been in german hands think
it over and you can reason out yourself how it
worked 

  and what did you do next your excellency i
asked more or less apologetically for having doubted
the great mans word

  my last experience with the allies having proved
so humiliating to me i did not wish to show my
face in europe any longer so i decided to come to
america where i arrived in the middle of march
having been in america previously the country was
not new to me as a matter of fact i had acquired
a large estate on the south shore of long island
some years before i retired there and having few
friends in the neighborhood i was able shortly to
complete my inventions on which i had been experi-
menting in paris before the war brought an abrupt
termination to my work

  the problems of gravity had long attracted me
most powerfully with newton the famous i won-
dered what made an apple fall from a tree or a brick

  from a roof newton long ago in his famous works
had told us the why but he had died without know-
ing the how he knew all the laws governing grav-
ity but he knew not what the force consisted of
lie was very much like edison who knows a great
deal about electricity and its laws but who does not
know what electricity itself consists of

  it did not take me a long time to actually solve
the mysteries of gravity once i hit upon the right
track i found that gravity like electricity is a
certain manifestation of the luminiferous ether which
permeates the universe and all matter

  once i had solved the mystery i set out immedi-
ately to find an insulator for gravity and in a few
days i had solved this problem in a masterful
manner

  to make myself plain on earth all objects are
attracted to the center of the earth by the force
known as gravity whether it be a cannon ball or
a feather both will fall on the earths surface if
unsupported if some means could be found to
interpose between a falling apple and the earth a
gravity insulator through which gravity could not
act the apple would stay suspended in mid-air the-
oretically it could not fall to the earth because
there would no longer be any gravity to attract it

  a parallel to the above is found in the following
simple experiment take a steel ball and rest it on
a smooth surface then take a strong horseshoe
magnet with it approach the steel ball as soon as
the magnet comes close enough the ball will roll
toward the magnet till it reaches it separate the
two again and repeat the performance but before
the ball reaches the magnet interpose a magnetic
insulator between ball and magnet-in this instance
a stout piece of sheet iron the iron will take up
all the magnetism and no magnetic flux will reach
the ball consequently it will lie still unaffected by
the strong magnet which is just as strong as ever
but is neutralized by the piece of sheet iron

  to go further before any form of energy can
be transmitted from one point to the other it must
pass through a conducting medium take the medium
away and the energy cannot be transmitted any
longer to illustrate

  take sound for example-a simple form of en-
ergy a bell rings the sound waves generated
from the bells gong travel through the air till they
strike your ear drum you hear the bell in this
case the air is the conveying medium take the air
away and you can no longer hear the bell thus
when a bell is placed under a glass globe you can
still hear the bell now with an air pump exhaust
the air from the globe you can still see the clapper
of the bell strike thegong furiously but you can-
not hear a single sound because you have taken
away the conducting medium which is the air

  to go a step further you look at the sun some
 miles distant from you you see its
rays you feel its heat thusthe sun sends a colos-
sal amount of energy down to earth as well as to the
other planets what is the necessary conducting
medium here the luminiferous ether that mys-
terious fluid so fine so intangible that man has as
yet neither seen nor felt nor weighed it never-
theless we have long known of its existence it
fills the pores of the densest metal as well as all
space in the universe there is no atom on earth
or in the heavens which it does not permeate com-
pletely at all times
baron munchhausen



   but of course this is all well known to you

i	simply recite it so that the following may become
plain to you

   i take a glass tube five feet long in which i place
a piece of cork then i exhaust all the air from
the tube when i turn the tube upside down the
cork will of course fall from the top of the tube
to the bottom through what medium does the
energy of gravity pass to reach the cork and force
it to fall down  the ether i now take my gravity
insulator place it between the tube and the earth and
turn the tube upside down wrhat happens the
cork no longer falls down but stays on top further-
more the entire tube cork and all floats in the air
when my hand releases it gravitational force can-
not reach the tube it is insulated the same as
glass insulates electricity and prevents it from leav-
ing its conducting wire

   my gravity insulator is simply a curiously ar-
ranged wire netting of insulated marconium wires
crossing each other at right angles marconium is a
certain metal of the rubidium group discovered by
me a netting of this wire when excited with a
powerful current of a peculiar wave and a frequency
running into the millions acts as a perfect insulator
toward gravity because it neutralizes the ether
above and below it when placed above the
ground you can pile tons of metal or stone or any
other material over it it will not touch the gravity
insulator unless you push it down on it by applying
an external force the material cannot drop on the
insulator by its own weight because nothin has
weight in space where there is no gravity

   to prove this axiom i placed a spring scale over
my gravity insulator the scale stayed suspended
as soon as i took my hands away from it now i
placed weights on top of the scale starting with a
one-pound weight the scale registered no weight
even when i increased the weight to  pounds
under normal conditions my weights would liave
tipped the scales to  pounds on top of the
insulator the weight had vanished the same as the
sound of your bell will vanish when you place it in
- vacuum in order that you will not draw any
wrong conclusions let me state explicitly that the
etherless zone is confined only to about one inch
above and below the marconium wire netting thus
any object placed above the insulator is of course
surrounded by ether else you could not see it but
gravity on earth unlike ether acts only in a straight
line this line passing through the center of the earth

  for this reason objects placed above my in-
sulator will stay suspended only if placed directly
above it if a part of the object extends over the
edge of the netting the object will fall down on the
netting because gravity will pull down on the ex-
posed part of the object in order to carry out
these experiments successfully it is quite necessary
that the sun as well as the moon be quite below the
earths horizon if this precaution is not taken the
object above the insulator will be immediately at-
tracted toward the sun or toward the moon unless
another gravity insulator is placed above the object
to neutralize the suns or the moons gravitational
attraction

  my invention completed i immediately set to
work toward building a machine which would enable
me to leave the earth i accordingly constructed

   a very strong steel globe about  feet in diameter
which was to take me out into space my first
planned excursion was to our nearest neighbor in
space-the moon-which is only about  miles
distant

  the steel globe which was to take me to the
moon had its entire outer surface covered with a
double marconium netting the free insulated wire
ends of the netting entering the globe where they
were connected to an elaborate switching arrange-
ment running around the globes circumference-
its equator-a wide belt or track was provided
this was the landing track on it the globe could
readily roll over the ground without damaging the
marconium wires underneath this track was also
made of marconium and was carefully insulated
from the rest of the globe the interior of the
globe was well furnished for all comforts and had
a powerful electric plant similar in many respects
to a modern submarine power plant

  after having completed all arrangements hav-
ing stocked the machine with all kinds of provisions
fuel and many scientific instruments and apparatus

i	made ready to leave old mother earth the trip
being extra hazardous i took only one person along
an intimate friend of mine-professor hezekiah
flitternix of columbia university

  the only other animate passengers of the expedi-
tion were buster my fox terrier and pee-pix the
professors canary bird which he refused to leave
behind

  the moon being full and almost overhead we
entered my machine which i had christened the
evening before as the interstellar the heavy
soft rubber-lined steel doors were screwed up air-
tight in order that our air should not be drawn out
after we got into the open space and i started the
generating apparatus i switched on the marconium
wires which covered the outer surface of the inter-
stellar which was turned toward the earth

  the half of the netting turned toward the moon
was not switched on

  through the glass portholes at the bottom of
the machine we could see the marconium wires
glowing in their characteristic green glow immedi-
ately we were lifted toward the moon overhead at a
frightful speed in less than  seconds the entire
american continent became visible and in a few
more seconds the earth in its true form an immense
globe stood out against a pitch-black sky

  as light cannot pass through an excited mar-
conium netting it was necessary to switch off the
current for a few seconds every time we wished to
see earth beneath us

  the upper part of our machine turned toward
the moon was now subjected to the moons gravi-
tational attraction-the earth on account of the
machines other half being gravity-insulated no

author of the time machine a story of the stone age etc

    but he was not quick enough to prevent the man who was anxious to get to pollocks side of the bargain from opening the cloth and
    throwing the head of the porroh man upon the table it bounded from there onto the floor leaving a red trail on the cards and rolled to

the side where it came to test upside down but glaring hard at pollock


pollock and the porroh man

 t was in a swampy village on the lagoon
 river behind the turner peninsula that
 pollocks first encounter with the por-
 roh man occurred the women of that
 country are famous for their good looks
 -they are gallinas with a dash of european blood
 that dates from the days of vasco de gama and the
 english slave-traders and the porroh man too was
 possibly inspired by a faint caucasian taint in his
 composition its a curious thing to think that
 some of us may have distant cousins eating men on
 sherboro island or raiding with the sofas at
 any rate the porroh man stabbed the woman to the
 heart as though he had been a mere low-class italian
 and very narrowly missed pollock but pollock
 using his revolver to parry the lightning stab which
 was aimed at his deltoid muscle sent the iron dagger
 flying and firing hit the man in the hand

   he fired again and missed knocking a sudden
 window out of the wall of the hut the porroh
 man stooped in he doorway glancing under his arm
 at pollock pollock caught a glimpse of his inverted
 face in the sunlight and then the englishman was
 alone sick and trembling with the excitement of
 the affair in the twilight of the place it had all
 happened in less time than it takes to read about it

   the woman was quite dead and having ascer-
 tained this pollock went to the entrance of the
 hut and looked out i hings outside were dazzling
 bright half a dozen of the porters of the expedi-
 tion were standing up in a group near the green huts
 they occupied and staring towards him wondering
 what the shots might signify behind the little
 group of men was the broad stretch of black fetid
 mud by the river a green carpet of rafts of papyrus
 and water-grass and then the leaden water the
 mangroves beyond the stream loomed indistinctly
 through the blue haze there were no signs of ex-
 citement in the squat village whose fence was just
 visible above the cane-grass

   pollock came out of the hut cautiously and walked
 towards the river looking over his shoulder at in-
 tervals but the porroh man had vanished pol-
 lock clutched his revolver nervously in his hand

   one of his men came to meet him and as he
 came pointed to the bushes behind the hut in which
 the porroh man had dis-
 appeared pollock had an 

 irritating persuasion of
 having made an absolute
 fool of himself he felt
 bitter savage at the turn
 things had taken at the
 same time he would have
 to tell waterhouse - the
 moral exemplary cautious
 waterhouse - who would		-

 inevitably take the matter

 seriously pollock cursed bitterly at his luck at
 waterhouse and especially at the west coast of
 africa he felt consummately sick of the expedi-
 tion and in the back of his mind all the time was a
 speculative doubt where precisely within the visible
 horizon the porroh man might be

   it is perhaps rather shocking but he was not at
 all upset by the murder that had just happened he
 had seen so much brutality during the last three
 months so many dead women burnt huts drying
 skeletons up the kittam river in the wake of the
 sofa cavalry that his senses were blunted what

 t-tf-re is an extraordimry story by mr wells which
  - deals with the occult

   many are the tales brought back from tropical sections
 of our earth where the aborigines have often been re-
 corded as being able to cast certain spells over their
 victims hypnotic or otherwise mr wells has exploited
 this phase to a marked degree this story frankly gives
 on the creeps yet holds ones interest to the end



 disturbed him was the persuasion that this business
 was only beginning

   he swore savagely at the black who ventured
 to ask a question and went on into the tent under the
 orange-trees where waterhouse was lying feeling
 exasperatingly like a boy going into the head masters
 study

    waterhouse was still sleeping off the effects of his
 last dose of chlorodyne and pollock sat down on a
 packing-case beside him and lighting his pipe
 waited for him to awake about him were scat-
 tered the pots and weapons waterhouse had col-
 lected from the mendi people and which he had
 been repacking for the canoe voyage to sulyma

    presently waterhouse woke up and after judicial
 stretching decided he was all right again pollock
 got him some tea over the tea the incidents of
 the afternoon were described by pollock after some
 preliminary beating about the bush waterhouse
 took the matter even more seriously than pollock
 had anticipated he did not simply disapprove he
 scolded he insulted

    youre one of those infernal fools who think a
 black man isnt a human being he said i cant
 be ill a day without you must get into some dirty
 scrape or other this is the third time in a month
 that you have come crossways-on with a native and
 this time youre in for it with a vengeance porroh
 too  theyre down upon you enough as it is about
 that idol you wrote your silly name on and theyre
 the most vindictive devils on earth you make a
 man ashamed of civilization to think you come of
 a decent family if ever i cumber myself up with
 a vicious stupid young lout like you again-
 steady on now snarled pollock in the tone that
 always exasperated waterhouse steady on

    at that waterhouse became speechless he jumped
 to his feet

    look here pollock he said after a struggle to
 control his breath you must go home i wont
 have you any longer im ill enough as it is through
 you-

    keep your hair on said pollock staring in front
 of him im ready enough to go

   waterhouse became calmer again he sat down
 on the camp-stool very well he said i dont

 want a row pollock you
 know but its confound-
 edly annoying to have ones
 plans put out by this kind
 of thing ill come to sul-
 yma with you and see you
 safe aboard-

    you neednt said pol-
 lock i can go alone

  from here

                           not far said water-
     	house you dont under-

 stand this porroh business

 how should  know she belonged to a porroh
 man  said pollock bitterly

 well she did said waterhouse and you cant
undo the thing go alone indeed i wonder what
theyd do to you you dont seem to understand
that this porroh hokey-pokey rules this country is
its law religion constitution medicine magic

they appoint the chiefs the inquisition at its best
couldn t hold a candle to these chaps he will prob-
ably set awajale the chief here on to us its
lucky our porters are mendis we shall have to
amazing stories



 shift this little settlement of ours    confound you
 pollock and of course you must go and miss
 him

   he thought and his thoughts seemed disagree-
 able presently he stood up and took his rifle i d
 keep close for a bit if i were you he said over
 his shoulder as he went out im going out to see
 what i can find out about it

   pollock remained sitting in the tent meditating

 i was meant for a civilizcd life he said to him-
 self regretfully as he filled his pipe the sooner
 i get back to london or paris the better for me

   his eye fell on the sealed case in which water-
 house had put the featherless poisoned arrows
 they had bought in the mendi country i wish i
 had hit the beggar somewhere vital saic pollock
 viciously

   waterhouse came back after a long interval he
 was not communicative though pollock asked him
 questions enough the porroh man it seems was
 a prominent member of that mystical society the
 village was interested but not threatening no
 doubt the witch-doctor had gone into the bush he
 was a great witch-doctor of course he s up to
 something said waterhouse and became silent

   but what can he do asked pollock unheeded
 i must get you out of this theres something
 brewing or things would not be so quiet said
 waterhouse after a gap of silence pollock wanted
 to know what the brew might be dancing m a
 circle of skulls said waterhouse brewing a stink
 in a copper pot pollock wanted particulars watei-
 house was vague pollock pressing at last w ater-
 house lost his temper how the devil should i
 know  he said to pollocks twentieth inquiry what
 the porroh man would do he tried to kill you
 off-hand in the hut now i fancy he will try some-
 thing more elaborate but youll see fast enough

 i dont want to help unnerve you its probably all
 nonsense

   that night as they were sitting at their hre
 pollock again tried to draw waterhouse out on the
 subject of porroh methods better get to sleep
 said waterhouse when pollocks bent became ap-
 parent we start early to-morrow you may want
 all your nerve about you

   but what line will he take

   cant say theyre versatile people they know
 a lot of rum dodges youd better get that copper-
 devil shakespear to talk

   there was a flash and a heavy bang out of the
 darkness behind the huts and a clay bullet came
 whistling close to pollocks head this at least was
 crude enough the blacks and half-breeds sitting
 and yarning round their own fire jumped up and
 someone fired into the dark	 r 

   better go into one of the huts said w aterhouse
 quietly still sitting unmoved	

   pollock stood up by the fire and drew his revolver
 fighting at least he was not afraid of but a man
 in the dark is in the best of armor realizing the
 wisdom of waterhouses advice pollock went into
 the tent and lay down there

 what little sleep he had was disturbed by
 dreams variegated dreams but chiefly of the
 porroh mans face upside down as he went out of
 the hut and looked up under his arm it was odd
 that this transitory impression should have stuck so

 firmly in pollocks memory moreover he was
 troubled by queer pains in his limbs

   in the white haze of tha early morning as they
 were loading the canoes a barbed arrow suddenly
 appeared quivering in the ground close to pollocks
 foot the boys made a perfunctory effort to clear
 out the thicket but it led to no capture

   after these two occurrences there was a disposi-
 tion on the part of the expedition to leave pollock
 to himself and pollock became for the first time in
 his life anxious to mingle with blacks waterhouse
 took one canoe and pollock in spite of a friendly
 desire to chat with waterhouse had to take the
 other he was left all alone in the front part of
 the canoe and he had the greatest trouble to make
 the men-who did not love him-keep to the middle
 of the river a clear hundred yards or more from
 either shore however he made shakespear the
 freetown half-breed come up to his own end of the
 canoe and tell him about porroh which shakespear
 failing in his attempts to leave pollock alone pres-
 ently did with considerable freedom and gusto

   the day passed the canoe glided swiftly along
 the ribbon of lagoon water between the drift of
 water-figs fallen trees papyrus and palm-wine
 palms and with the dark mangrove swamp to the left
 through which one could hear now and then the roar
 of the atlantic surf shakespear told in his soft
 blurred english of how the porroh could cast spells
 how men withered up under their malice how they
 could send dreams and devils how they tormented
 and killed the sons of ijibu how they kidnapped a
 white trader from sulyma who had maltreated one
 of the sect and how his body looked when it was
 found and pollock after each narrative cursed
 under his breath at the want of -missionary enter-
 prise that allowed such things to be and at the
 inert british government that ruled over this dark
 heathendom of sierra leone in the evening they
 came to the icasi lake and sent a score of crocodiles
 lumbering off the island on which the expedition
 camped for the night

   the next day they reached sulyma and smelt the
 sea breeze but pollock had to put up there for five
 days before he could get on to freetown water-
 house considering him to be comparatively safe here
 and within the pale of freetown influence left him
 and went back with the expedition to gbemma and
 pollock became very friendly with perera the only
 resident white trader at sulyma-so friendly in-
 deed that he went about with him everywhere
 perera was a little portuguese jew who had lived
 in england and he appreciated the englishmans
 friendliness as a great compliment

    for two days nothing happened out of the or-
 dinary  for the most part pollock and perera played
 nap-the only game they had in common-and
 pollock got into debt then on the second evening
 pollock had a disagreeable intimation of the arrival
 of the porroh man in sulyma by getting a flesh-
 wound in the shoulder from a lump of filed iron it
 was a long shot and the missile had nearly spent
 its force when it hit him still it conveyed its
 message plainly enough pollock sat up in his ham-
 mock revolver in hand all that night and next
 morning confided to some extent in the anglo-
 portuguese

    perera took the matter seriously he knew the
   local customs pretty thoroughly it is a personal
   question you must know it is revenge and of
pollock and the porroh man

 course he is hurried by your leaving de country
 none of de natives or half-breeds will interfere wid
 him very much-unless you make it wort deir while
 if you come upon him suddenly you might shoot
 him but den he might shoot you

  den deres dis-infernal magic said perera
 of course i dont believe in it-superstition-but
 still its not nice to tink dat wherever you are dere
 is a black man who spends a moonlight night now
 and den a-dancing about a fire to send you bad
 dreams    had any bad dreams 

   rather said pollock i keep on seeing the
 beggars head upside down grinning at me and show-
 ing all his teeth as he did in the hut and coming
 close up to me and then going ever so far off and
 coming back its nothing to be afraid of but some-
 how it simply paralyzes me with terror in my sleip
 queer things-dreams i know its a dreain all the
 time and i cant wake up from it

   its probably only fancy said perera den
 my niggers say porroh men can send snakes seen
 any snakes lately

   only one i killed him this morning on the
 floor near my hammock almost trod on him as i
 got up

   ah said perera and then reassuringly of
 course it is a-coincidence still i would keep my
 eyes open den deres pains in de bones

   i thought they were due to miasma said pollock
   probably dey are when did dey begin 

   then pollock remembered that lie first noticed
 them the night after the fight in the hut its my
 opinion he dont want to kill you said perera-at
 least not yet ive heard deir idea is to scare and
 worry a man wid deir spells and narrow misses and
 rheumatic pains and bad dreams and all dat until
 hes sick of life of course its all talk you know
 you mustnt worry about it    but i wonder what
 hell be up to next

   i shall have to be up to something first said
 pollock staring gloomily at the greasy cards that
 perera was putting on the table it dont suit my
 dignity to be followed about and shot at and
 blighted in this way i wonder if porroh hokey-
 pokey upsets your luck at cards

   he looked at perera suspiciously

   very likely it does said perera warmly shuf-
 fling dey are wonderful people

   that afternoon pollock killed two snakes in his
 hammock and there was also an extraordinary in-
 crease in the number of red ants that swarmed over
 the place and these annoyances put him in a fit
 temper to talk over business with a certain mendi
 rough lie had interviewed before the mendi rough
 showed pollock a little iron dagger and demon-
 strated where one struck in the neck in a way that
 made pollock shiver and in return for certain con-
 siderations pollock promised him a double-barrelled
 gun with an ornamental lock

   in the evening as pollock and perera were play-
 ing cards the mendi rough came in through the
 doorway carrying something jn a blood-soaked piece
 of native cloth

   not here said pollock very hurriedly not
 here

   but he was not quick enough to prevent the man
 who was anxious to get to pollocks side of the
 bargain from opening the cloth and throwing the
 head o f the porroh man upon the table it bounded
 from there on to the floor leaving a red trail on



 the cards and rolled into a corner where it came
 to rest upside down but glaring hard at pollock

   perera jumped up as the thing fell among the
 cards and began in his excitement to gabble in
 portuguese the mendi was bowing with the red
 cloth in his hand de gun he said pollock stared
 back at the head in the corner it bore exactly the
 expression it had in his dreams something seemed
 to snap in his own brain as he looked at it

   then perera found his english again

    you got him killed he said you did not kill
 him yourself

    why should i  said pollock

    but he will not be able to take it off now
    take what off said pollock

    and all dese cards are spoiled

   what do you mean by taking off said pollock
 tou must send me a new pack from freetown
 you can buy dem dere

   but-take it off

 it is only superstition i forgot de niggers say
 dat if de witches-he was a witch- but it is rubbish

    you must make de porroh man take it off or
 kill him yourself  it is very silly

    pollock swore under his breath still staring hard
 at the head in the corner

   i cant stand that glare he said then sud-
 denly he rushed at the thing and kicked it it rolled
 some yards or so and came to rest in the same
 position as before upside down and looking at him

   he is ugly said the anglo-portuguese very
 ugly dey do it on deir faces with little knives
 pollock would have kicked the head again but
 the mendi man touched him on the arm de gun
 he said looking nervously at the head

   two-if you will take that beastly thing away
 said pollock

   i he mendi shook his head and intimated that
 he only wanted one gun now due to him and for
 which he would be obliged pollock found neither
 cajolery nor bullying any good with him perera
 had a gun to sell at a profit of three hundred per
 cent and with that the man presently departed
 then pollocks eyes against his will were recalled
 to the thing  the floor

   it is funny dat his head keeps upside down
 said perera with an uneasy laugh his brains must
 be heavy like de weight in de little images one sees
 dat keep always upright wid lead in dem you will
 take him wiv you when you go presently you
 might take him now de cards are all spoilt dere
 is a man sell dem in freetown de room is in a
 filthy mess as it is you should have killed him
 yourself

pollock pulled himself together and went and
picked up the head he would hang it up by the
lamp-hook in the middle of the ceiling of his room
and dig a grave for it at once he was under the
impression that he hung it up by the hair but that
must have been wrong for when he returned for it
it was hanging by-the neck upside down

   he buried it before sunset on the north side of
 the shed he occupied so that he should not have to
 pass the grave after dark when he was returning
 from pereras he killed two snakes before he went
 to sleep in the darkest part of the night he awoke
 with a start and heard a pattering sound and some-
 thing scraping on the floor he sat up noiselessly
 and felt under his pillow for his revolver a mum-
	amazing

 bling growl followed and pollock fired at the sound
 there was a yelp and something dark passed for
 a moment across the hazy blue of the doorway a
 dog said pollock lying down again

   in the early dawn he awoke again with a peculiar
 sense of unrest the vague pain in his bones had
 returned for some time he lay watching the red
 ants that were swarming over the ceiling and then
 as the light grew brighter he looked over the edge
 of his hammock and saw something dark on the
 floor he gave such a violent start that the ham-
 mock overset and flung him out

   -ie found himself lying perhaps a yard away
 from the head of the porroh man it had been
 disinterred by the dog and the nose was grievously
 battered ants and flies swarmed over it by an
 odd coincidence it was still upside down aftd with
 the same diabolical expression in the inverted eyes

   pollock sat paralyzed and stared at the horror for
 some time then he got up and walked round it--
 giving it a wide berth-and out of the shed  he
 clear light of the sunrise the living stir of vegeta-
 tion before the breath of the dying land-breeze and
 the empty grave with the marks of the dogs paws
 lightened the weight upon his mind a little

   he told perera of the business as though it was a
 jest-a jest to be told with white lips you should
 not have frighten de dog said perera with poorly
 simulated hilarity

   the next two days until the steamer came were
 spent by pollock in making a more effectual disposi-
 tion of his possession overcoming his aversion to
 handling the thing he went down to the river mouth
 and threw it into the sea-water but by some miracle
 it escaped the crocodiles and was cast up by the tide
 on tlie mud a little way up the river to be found
 by an intelligent arab half-breed and offered for
 sale to pollock and perera as a curiosity just on the
 edge of night the native hung about in the brief
 twilight making lower and lower offers and at last
 getting scared in some way by the evident dread
 these wise white men had for the thing went off
 and passing pollocks shed threw his burden in
 there for pollock to discover in the morning

   at this pollock got into a kind of frenzy he
 would burn the thing he went out straightway
 into the dawn and had constructed a big pyre of
 brushwood before the heat of the day he was
 interrupted by the hooter of the little paddle steamer
 from monrovia to bathurst which was coming
 through the gap in the bar thank heaven said
 pollock with infinite piety when the meaning of the
 sound dawned upon him with trembling hands he
 lit his pile of wood hastily threw the head upon it
 and went away to pack his portmanteau and make
 his adieus to perera

   that afternoon with a sense of infinite relief
 pollock watched the flat swampy foreshore of the
 sulyma grow small in the distance the gap in
 the long line of white surge became narrower and
 narrower it seemed to be closing in and cutting
 him off from his trouble the feeling of dread
 and worry began to slip from him bit by bit at
 sulyma belief in porroh malignity and porroh magic
 had been in the air his sense of porroh had been
 vast pervading threatening dreadful

   now manifestly the domain of porroh was only a
 little place a little black band between the sea and the
 blue cloudy mendi uplands

stories

  good-bye porroh said pollock good-bye-
 certainly not an revoir

  the captain of the steamer came and leant over
 the rail beside him and wished him good-evening
 and spat at the froth of the wake in token of friendly
 ease

  i picked up a rummy curio on the beach this
 go said the captain its a thing i never saw done
 this side of indy before

  what might that be said pollock

   pickled ed said the captain

  what said pollock

   ed-smoked ed of one of these porroh
chaps all ornamented with knife-cuts why
whats up nothing i shouldnt have took you
for a nervous chap green in the face by gosh
youre a bad sailor all right eh lord how
funny you went    well this ed i was telling you
of is a bit rum in a way ive got it along with
some snakes in a jar of spirit in my cabin what i
keeps for such curios and im hanged if it dont
float upsy down hallo

  pollock had given an incoherent cry and had his
 hands in hishair he ran towards the paddle-boxes
 with a half-formed idea of jumping into the sea and
 then he realized his position and turned back towards
 the captain

  here said the captain jack philips just
 keep him off me stand off no nearer mister
 whats the matter with you are you mad
 pollock put his hand to his head it was no good
 explaining i believe i am pretty nearly mad at
 times he said its a pain i have here comes
 suddenly youll excuse me i hope

  he was white and in a perspiration he saw sud-
 denly very clearly all the danger he ran of having
 his sanity doubted he forced himself to restore
 the captains confidence by answering his sympa-
 thetic inquiries noting his suggestions even trying
 a spoonful of neat brandy in his cheek and that
 matter settled asking a number of questions about
 the captains private trade in curiosities the cap-
 tain described the head in detail all the while pol-
 lock was struggling to keep under a preposterous
 persuasion that the ship was as transparent as glass
 and that he could distinctly see the inverted face
 looking at him from the cabin beneath his feet

  pollock had a worse time almost on the steamer
 than he had at sulyma all day he had to control
 himself in spite of his intense perception of the im-
 minent presence of that horrible head that was over-
 shadowing his mind at night his old nightmare
 returned until with a violent effort he would force
 himself awake rigid with the horror of it and with
 the ghost of a hoarse scream in his throat

  he left the actual head behind at bathurst where
 he changed ship for teneriffe but not his dreams
 nor the dull ache in his bones at teneriffe pol-
 lock transferred to a cape liner but the head fol-
 lowed him he gambled he tried chess he even
 read books but he knew the danger of drink y et
 whenever a round black shadow a round black ob-
 ject came into his range there he looked for the head
 and-saw it he knew clearly enough that his im-
 agination was growing traitor to him and yet at
 times it seemed the ship he sailed in his fellow-
 passengers the sailors the wide sea was all part of
 a filmy phantasmagoria that hung scarcely veiling it
 between him and a horrible real world then the
 porroh man thrusting his diabolical face through
pollock and the porroh man



 that curtain was the one real and undeniable thing
 at that he would get up and touch things taste some-
 thing gnaw something burn his hand with a match
 or run a needle into himself

so struggling grimly and silently with his excited
imagination pollock reached england he landed
at southampton and went on straight from water-
loo to his bankers in cornhill in a cab there he
transacted some business with the manager in a
private room and all the while the head hung like
an ornament under the black marble mantel and
dripped upon the fender he could hear the drops
fall and see the red on the fender

  a pretty fern said the manager following his
eyes but it makes the fender rusty

  very said pollock a very pretty fern and
that reminds me can you recommend me a physi-
cian for mind troubles ive got a little-what is
it -hallucination

  the head laughed savagely wildly pollock was
surprised the manager did not notice it but the
manager only stared at his face

  with the address of a doctor pollock presently
emerged in cornhill there was no cab in sight and
so he went on down to the western end of the street
and essayed the crossing opposite the mansion
house the crossing is hardly easy even for the ex-
pert londoner cabs vans carriages mail-carts
omnibuses go by in one incessant stream to any one
fresh from the malarious solitudes of sierra leone
it is a boiling maddening confusion but when an
inverted head suddenly comes bouncing like an india
rubber ball between your legs leaving distinct
smears of blood every time it touches the ground you
can scarcely hope to avoid an accident pollock
lifted his feet convulsively to avoid it and then
kicked at the thing furiously then something hit
him violently in the back and a hot pain ran up
his arm

  he had been hit by the pole of an omnibus and
three fingers of his left hand were smashed by the
hoof of one of the horses-the very fingers as it
happened that he shot from the porroh man they
pulled him out from between the horses legs and
found the address of the physician in his crushed
hand

   for a couple of days pollocks sensations were full
of the sweet pungent smell of chloroform of painful
operations that caused him no pain of lying still and
being given food and drink then he had a slight
fever and was very thirsty and his old nightmare
came back it was only when it returned that he
noticed it had left him for a day

  if my skull had been smashed instead of my
fingers it might have gone altogether said pollock
staring thoughtfully at the dark cushion that had
taken on for the time the shape of the head

   pollock at the first opportunity told the physician
of his mind trouble he knew clearly that he must
go mad unless something should intervene to save
him he explained that he had witnessed a decapi-
tation in dahomey and was haunted by one of the
heads naturally he did not care to state the actual
facts the physician looked grave

  presently he spoke hesitatingly as a child did
you get very much religious training

   very little said pollock

   one of the great london railroad termini

   a shade passed over the physicians face i dont
know if you have heard of the miraculous cures-it
may be of course they are not miraculous-at
lourdes

  faith-healing will hardly suit me i am afraid
said pollock with his eye on the dark cushion

  the head distorted its scarred features in an
abominable grimace the physician went upon a
new track its all imagination he said speaking
with sudden briskness a fair case of faith-healing
anyhow your nervous system has run down youre
in that twilight state of health when the bogles come
easiest the strong impression was too much for
you i must make you up a little mixture that  will
strengthen your nervous system-especially your
brain and you must take exercise

  im no good for faith-healing said pollock

  and therefore we must restore tone go in search
of stimulating air-scotland norway the alps-

  jericho if you like said pollock-where naa-
man went

  however so soon as his fingers would let him
pollock made a gallant attempt to follow out the
doctors suggestion it was now november he
tried football but to pollock the game consisted in
kicking a furious inverted head about a field he
was no good at the game he kicked blindly with
a kind of horror and when they put him back into
goal and the ball came swooping down upon him
he suddenly yelled and got out of its way the dis-
creditable stories that had driven him from england
to wander in the tropics shut him off from any but
mens society and now his increasingly strange be-
havior made even his man friends avoid him the
thing was no longer a thing of the eye merely it
gibbered at him spoke to him a horrible fear
came upon him that presently when he took hold of
the apparition it would no longer become some mere
article of furniture but would feel like a real dis-
severed head alone he would curse at the thing
defy it entreat it once or twice in spite of his
grim self-control he addressed it in the presence of
others i-ie felt the growing suspicion in the eyes
of his landlady the servant his man

  one day early in december his cousin arnold-
his next of kin-came to see him and draw him out
and watch his sunken yellow face with narrow eager
eyes and it seemed to pollock that the hat his
cousin carried in his hand was no hat at all but a
gorgon head that glared at him upside down and
fought with its eyes against his reason however he
was still resolute to see the matter out he got a
bicycle and riding over the frosty road from wands-
worth to kingston found the thing rolling along at
his side and leaving a dark trail behind it he set
his teeth and rode faster then suddenly as he
came down the hill towards richmond park the
apparition rolled in front of him and under his
wheel so quickly that he had no time for thought
and turning quickly to avoid it was flung violently
against a heap of stones and broke his left wrist

  the end came on christmas morning all night
he had been in a fever the bandages encircling his
wrist like a band of fire his dreams more vivid and
terrible than ever in the cold colorless uncertain
light that came before the sunrise he sat up in his
bed and saw the head upon the bracket in the place
of the bronze jar that had stood there overnight

just as i grasped it the last of the screws holding the light fixture gave way and with a jerk that almost pulled my arm out of its socket
the entire strain was shifted to my body    gradually more and more of the hyper-forceps came into view until it was entirely
visible  as i slowly drew it toward me first the right arm then the torso and leg and finally the head of doctor mayer loomed into
view his left arm except for a small part close to his shoulder was still invisible however

omeone said that fame is a fickle
jade she certainly has been incon-
stant to me judging from the events
that occurred subsequent to the mysteri-
ous disappearance of william james
sidelburg and his four dimensional roller press
which i helped him build

  though i was fully exonerated from all blame in
connection with the tragedy the enormous amount
of publicity i received as a result of it proved almost
as disastrous to me as the fabled golden touch
of king midas was to him

  when sidelburg vanished so did my job and i
had a dickens of a time landing another wherever
i applied i found that the story of how i had as-
sisted the precocious young mathematician to luild
a machine which had expanded his body to enormous
proportions causing him to drift away like a balloon
had preceded me

  i answered countless advertisements for work i
knew i could do well only to be turned down the
instant i gave my name i finally managed to eke
out a few dollars by writing articles and stories for
scientific magazines but my income from this source
was small and uncertain

  when i had almost reached the point of worrying
over how i was to pay my small weekly bill at the
cheap boarding house where i had been living i was
surprised one morning by distinguished visitors

  as i sat writing in my tiny bedroom the board-
ing mistress brought a card to me i could hardly
believe my eyes when i read

paul j mayer md

mayer brothers clinic

winchester wisconsin

  who has not heard of doctor paul mayer head
of the mayer brothers clinic famous the world
over for marvelous feats
of surgical skill 

show him up at once

i shouted to the landlady

  and how about the
other gentleman  she
stammered stupidly

the other gentleman

is there more than one

  yes but he didnt give
his name

  well for heavens
sake show them both up
more let them come too
mustnt keep them waiting

  when doctor mayer and his companion appeared
i was again astounded before he could start an
introduction i reached out my hand and said pro-
fessor banning is already well known to me he
probably doesnt remember me but i studied calculus
under him three years ago

  oh yes i remember you very well rejoined
the professor though i suspected that he said this
merely out of politeness and since i know you
permit me to present you to doctor paul mayer

  i certainly appreciate the honor of this visit
i said in all sincerity professor please be seated
in that rocker doctor you take the chair ill sit
on the bed

if you happen to be a mathematician the name of

professor banning will be just as familiar to you
as that of doctor mayer in their respective fields
both men are at the top of the ladder professor
banning has several mathematical accomplishments
to his credit which have made him internationally
famous he is best known as an authority on non-
euclidian geometry and on the fourth dimension in
which branches of mathematics he stands supreme

  among laymen william james sidelburg was per-
haps the best known exponent of the fourth dimen-
sion due largely without doubt to the publicity he
had received because of his youth and precocity

  professor banning on the other hand was little
known except among mathematical scholars he had
begun the study of the fourth dimension long before
sidelburg was born and had succeeded in working
out formulas and constructing models of four dimen-
sional objects far ahead of anything that had been
accomplished up to that time

  you can imagine how insignificant and how em-
barrassed i felt as i entertained these two distin-
guished personages in my poorly furnished tiny
bedroom

  doctor mayer started the interview with i un-
derstand that you are the originator of the four
dimensional roller press

  hardly the originator i hastened to correct him
the idea was conceived entirely by mr sidelburg
i was merely his assistant he hired me to work
out the mechanical details of his invention

  so much the better if you could do that for
one mathematician it ought to be equally easy for
you to do it for another am i not right

  i suppose so i stammered hardly knowing
what he was driving at

  well thats what we came to see you about you
may be interested in learning that the immediate
cause of our arriving at a very momentous decision
was a phrase in your story the four dimensional

roller press which ap-
peared recently in a well
known magazine you
quoted sidelburg as say-
ing that if it were possible
to move in a fourth di-
mension a doctor could
remove an appendix with-
out cutting the patients
skin

  thats true he did
say something of that
sort i responded

 and according to professor banning it is en-
tirely possible but perhaps id better let him tell
the rest of the story himself

  thus the professor picked up the conversation
a few days ago i took a trip to winchester and
placed myself under doctor mayers care for
some time i have been troubled with gall-stones and
i was told that if anyone could help me it would be
the mayer brothers after examining me they
advised against an operation they said that because
of my advanced age and the weakened condition of
my heart there was not one chance in a hundred
that i would survive a major operation of the or-
dinary sort it was then that i showed doctor
mayer the passage in your story which he has just
mentioned after giving him a brief explanation of
the theory of hyper-space i asked him if such an

 zjere the author of the four dimensional roller
  press comes back eclipsing his former story not
 a little this writer seems to have the knack of telling
 a four dimensional story that can be understood even by
 those who are not mathematicians or dyed-in-the-wool
 scientists ive always wanted to know what would hap-
 pen to us if we could actually be turned into the fourth
 dimension our author sets forth some excellent ideas
 along this line and zee know that you will be highly in-
 terested and entertained by this unusual tale

 and if there are any
 but hurry please you


amazing stories

operation would be possible from a medical stand-
point providing the mathematical and mechanical
features could be worked out successfully

  he assured me that if i could provide him with
instruments having four dimensional extension and
capable of motion in the direction of the fourth di-
mension he could perform even the most compli-
cated operations without the necessity of cutting the
skin of the person operated on naturally the thing
that interests me most right now is the possibility of
having my gall-stones removed without the shock
and dangerous strain that would result from an or-
dinary operation they have been giving me a lot
of trouble lately and one of these days they will kill
me my life would probably be prolonged a great
many years if i could get rid of them this would
enable me to devote myself to perfecting a complete
set of four dimensional surgical instruments which
should be the means of saving untold pain and hard-
ships to afflicted humanity

  the reason we have come to you is that both
doctor mayer and i are entirely lacking in mechani-
cal skill you on the other hand are an expert
mechanic still more important you have the in-
estimable advantage of being the only person we
know of who has actually constructed a four dimen-
sional object for these reasons we are asking you
to help us make some four dimensional surgical
instruments will you do it

  i hardly know what to say i faltered nat-
urally i know a little about the fourth dimension
but what you have just told me is away beyond
me

  perhaps id better explain it more in detail

  i wish you would

  the best way to get a clear conception of the
possibilities of hyper-space is by analogy as for
example by comparing the characteristics of three
dimensional objects with the limitations of other
hypothetical inhabitants of space having but two
dimensions-or even only one dimension

  imagine a creature like a very thin worm so thin
in fact that it might be considered as having neither
width nor thickness but only length this would be
a one dimensional being sometimes called a
unodim it could move ahead in a straight line
and could back up along the same line but would
be absolutely incapable of moving either to the right
or left or up or down to imprison such an animal
you need only put a grain of sand in front of it
and another behind it and it could not move either
around or over them

  now suppose we add another dimension namely
width we now have a being of two dimensions-
a duodim or flatlander-whichever nomenclature
you prefer about the nearest approach to such a
creature in nature would be a very flat flounder or
turtle but while a turtle has a very appreciable
amount of height the imaginary inhabitant of flat-
land would be thinner than the finest tissue paper
or gold leaf

  the movements of such a creature would be con-
fined to a single plane it could move forward and
backward to the right and left but it could not
move either up or down in order to confine it
you need merely to enclose it in a circle drawn with
a lead pencil and the flatlander could not get out of
the circle unless he were able to break a hole in the
ring by removing some of the graphite

  suppose there were two such creatures inside the
circle and suppose a three dimensional being like
yourself should pick up one of them move it through
the third dimension and place it outside the circle
to the other duodim its companion would seem to
vanish in an inexplicable manner if he were able
to break through the pencil mark and discover the
other flatlander outside he would be completely
baffled to explain how he managed to get there

  assuming that there is such a thing as a four
dimensional being it would be just as easy for it to
lift you out of this room without opening a door
or window as it would be for you to lift the duodim
over a pencil mark of course there are no such
creatures but the possibility of our being able to
accomplish similar miracles by means of mechanical
contrivances is entirely feasible

  let us return to flatland where all objects have
but two dimensions theoretically we can easily
conceive of such objects yet in actuality no such
things could possibly exist

  pardon me professor i interrupted but i
think i can give you an example of a familiar object
which has only two dimensions i remember hear-
ing a radio lecture given by a famous editor and
scientific writer who likened a two dimensional ob-
ject to a shadow obviously a shadow has length
and width but no thickness

  thats a good illustration professor banning
rejoined but i think your scientific lecturer would
not have used the term shadow but rather pro-
jection of a shadow the word shadow applies
to all the space from which the light is cut off by a
given object and though intangible it certainly has
three dimensions im glad you gave me that anal-
ogy however because it illustrates admirably the
point i want to make

  let us consider the shadow cast by a silver dollar
suppose the beams of light are parallel to each other
and are perpendicular to the dollar and to a perfectly
flat wall on which the shadow is cast the projec-
tion of the shadow on the wall will be a circle and
will have only two dimensions but the shadow itself
will be cylindrical in shape with the surface of the
dollar as one base the projection on the wall as the
other base and with an altitude equal to the distance
from the dollar to the wall

  if you place a piece of flat cardboard parallel to
the dollar anywhere between it and the wall a two
dimensional circular projection will be cast on the
card this shows that the three dimensional cylin-
drical shadow is really made up of an infinite num-
ber of circular projections no one of which has any
appreciable thickness

  but a shadow could hardly be considered as a
material object although peter pan was supposed
to have lost his shadow then there was the other
peter-peter schlemiel of the german story book
who sold his shadow to the devil in this charming
fable his satanic majesty is pictured as rolling
peters shadow up like a blanket and carrying it off
under his arm all this of course is pure fantasy

  in order for your flatlander to have real exist-
ence he must be made up of particles of matter
and that in itself makes some thickness necessary
even if he be only one-millionth as thick as the finest
gold leaf-which is about the thinnest tangible object
we know of compared to its length and width this
minute thickness would be practically equal to zero
four dimensional surgery



yet we can conceive of piling on top of each other
a sufficiently large number of such objects to build
up a thickness that can be seen and measured-just
as we can conceive of a three dimensional shadow as
being made up of an infinite number of two dimen-
sional projections

  now let us assume that there are three of these
flatlanders who are developed enough mentally so
that they can think in a third dimension and can
imagine the possibility of motion in a third dimen-
sion duodim number one a mathematician draws
a picture of a three dimensional object such as a
cylinder just as any artist can draw on a perfectly
flat piece of paper a picture that looks exactly like
a solid object

  suppose duodim number two-a mechanical ex-
pert using this picture as a basis cuts a large number
of circles out of some material-which of course
would have to be very thin-and places these circles
one on top of the other until he has actually made
a cylinder it would be but a step farther for him
to construct two rods fasten them together in the
form of a pair of tongs and bend them in such a way
that duodim number three-who is skillful in the
use of instruments-can pick up something in the
same plane a short distance away

  perhaps a diagram will make my meaning
clearer he picked up a pencil and a piece of paper
from the kitchen table i used as a desk and rapidly
drew a sketch like this

  pardon me i interposed but im afraid there
is a serious fallacy in your theory in order to lift
another object with a contrivance like that your
flatlander would be obliged to move through the
third dimension himself and according to the origi-
nal premises this would be impossible

  quite true the professor concurred my
sketch was not intended to be a practical working
drawing but merely a means of illustrating an idea
however it ought to be easy for you with your
knowledge of mechanics to design an instrument by
means of which motion in one plane can be converted
into motion at right angles to that plane isnt that
possible 

   i had to admit that it was

  very well all we need to do is construct such
a contrivance having extension in the fourth dimen-
sion and doctor mayer will be able to remove my
gall-stones without the slightest pain or shock to my
system

  but how am i going to know what a four dimen-
sional forceps or tongs looks like

  leave that to me just as the flatland mathema-
tician can draw a picture on a flat surface showing
what a three dimensional object looks like i by
using three dimensional units can construct models
which will visualize to you the appearance and char-
acteristics of a four dimensional object this may
sound complicated but it really is quite simple i
can take any child ten years old of ordinary intelli-
gence and by means of a brief explanation and a
few questions i can get him to work out the attri-
butes of a tesseract or four dimensional cube let
me illustrate

  he picked up the pencil again and jotted down
these headings

                 number number number number
                   in generated in	in

                initial by final tesser-
                cube motion cube act

points corners 

lines edges 

faces squares 

solids cubes 

  of course you understand how a tesseract is gen-
erated you first move a point or a comer-if you
prefer that nomenclature-a unit distance say one
centimeter this generates a line or edge one centi-
meter long next you move the line for a distance
of one centimeter at right angles to itself thus form-
ing a square with an area of one square centimeter
the next step is to move the square one centimeter at
right angles to both its width and length which will
form a cube one centimeter long one centimeter
wide and one centimeter high now it only remains
to move the cube for a distance of one centimeter in
a direction which is at right angles to its length
width and thickness but is not parallel to either of
its three dimensions and we have a unit tesseract

  lets see what this hyper-cube will look like
first we know that the cube we start with has how
many corners

  eight i answered after a moments thought
he jotted this down in the diagram and how
many edges

  twelve

  this also he wrote on the slip of paper and
how many faces

  six

  and of course theres just one cube

  now when we move a corner no other corners
are generated but at the end of the operation we
have a second cube with eight corners so the total
number of corners in our tesseract will be how
many 

   sixteen said i

  correct and each corner as it moves through
space will generate what

  a line

  and there are how many corners in the original
cube 

  eight

therefore eight lines or edges will be generated
by the motion if we add the twelve edges in the
original cube and the twelve more in the cube at the
end of the movement we will have how many
thirty-two

  thirty-two edges he repeated

  now for the faces we started with six square


amazing stories

faces in the original cube and there would be six
more in the final cube would there be any more 
certainly each edge would generate a square
there are twelve edges in the cube so there would be
twelve new squares generated six and six and
twelve makes a total of twenty-four faces in the
tesseract am i right

  very good indeed you seem to grasp the idea
admirably now see if you can tell me how many
cubes there will be in the tesseract

  let me see you have one cube to start with
and one more at the end of the motion each square
generates a cube there are six faces in the cube
six and two makes eight cubes in the tesseract
correct said the mathematician as he jotted
down the last figure and handed me the diagram
it read like this

               number number number number
                 in generated in	in

initial	by final tesser-

            cube motion cube act
points corners 		 

lines edges 	  

faces squares  	 

solids cubes 	

  you see how simple it is all we need to do is
construct an object bounded by eight cubes twenty-
four square faces thirty-two edges and sixteen cor-
ners and we have a four dimensional cube or tesser-
act

  since any object can be divided into a number of
parts each of which is a geometric solid of some
description and since i can work out the character-
istics of the four dimensional counterpart of any
geometrical solid it ought not to be difficult to con-
struct any kind of object in such a way that it will
have extension in four dimensions dont you think
thats reasonable 

  it certainly sounds reasonable to me

  and you will help us carry out these ideas in a
practical way inquired doctor mayer

  i hesitated

  this seemed to surprise them my enthusiasm
had evidently led them to expect my immediate con-
sent after a moment of deliberation i said im
sorry to disappoint you and i cant tell you how
much i appreciate the compliment you have paid me
but im afraid i shall not be able to help you

  is it a question of finance doctor mayer
wanted to know if so you may rest assured that
there will be plenty of money both for whatever
you need in the way of equipment and materials and
also for your own remuneration

  i wasnt thinking of money i hastened to as-
sure him theres no one dependent on me and
my chief ambition is to serve humanity as well as
my meager ability will permit otherwise i am sat-
isfied with a bare living i happen to be broke and
loafing right now and to be frank with you im
desperately in need of work but-

  then why in the world wont you work for us
professor banning interrupted

  for the same reason that a man who has nar-
rowly escaped drowning avoids skating on lhin ice
surely you dont think there is anything to be
afraid of this from the doctor

well sidelburg didnt think there was anything
to be afraid of-and look what happened to him

im not superstitious exactly but sometimes i think
that nature resents our efforts to pry into her secrets
-and punishes those who are too rash and impor-
tunate in wresting knowledge from her

  nonsense the professor scoffed if that were
so thomas a edison orville wright robert mill-
iken and hundreds of other great men would have
been destroyed long ago sidelburg was merely the
victim of an unforeseen accident he had just as
good a chance of being struck by lightning or
swallowed by an earthquake as of being destroyed
by the four dimensional roller press

  i read in the paper the other day about an elderly
lady who was trampled to death by a trained ele-
phant which became frightened while being led
through the streets to a theater where it was to per-
form in a vaudeville act i suppose that poor old
lady has repeatedly worried about getting cancer or
tuberculosis or being run over by an automobile but
i dont imagine she ever worried a minute about
being trampled by an elephant

  doctor mayer took up the argument you said
a moment ago that your chief ambition is to serve
humanity if you really meant that heres your op-
portunity just think of the suffering that can be
relieved when four dimensional surgery becomes a
reality think of the lives that will be spared and
prolonged-the grief and pain that will be assuaged
-the added happiness that will be made possible
suppose there is some danger you say theres no
one dependent on you arent you man enough to
take some risk to accomplish this great humanitarian
purpose 

  of course i gave in and consented to lend my
aid to the enterprise what else could i do that
very day i packed my meager belongings and ac-
companied by doctor mayer and professor banning
boarded the west bound express

  winchester had been selected as the place to carry
on our work-for very logical reasons to me one
place was as good as another professor banning
was equally indifferent to geographical location i
learned that he had just embarked on his sabbatical
year taid had planned to devote the entire vacation
period to the development of four dimensional sur-
gery

  doctor mayer on the other hand was still carry-
ing a heavy load of responsibility in connection with
his clinic while it was not necessary for him to
devote any appreciable amount of time to the work
of producing the first four dimensional forceps it
was thought best for us to be near him in case we
wished to consult him on the medical aspects of the
undertaking

  a portion of the hospital ground had been set
aside for our use and a contractor had been engaged
to erect a small building professor banning and
i together drew up the plans and supervised the
construction work while the structure was being
built i gave most of my attention to ordering ma-
terials machinery and other equipment

  as i look back now to the months i spent working
shoulder to shoulder with one of the greatest schol-
ars that ever lived i begin to realize that the best
education a person can get is that acquired from
intimate association with people of superior intellect

  professor banning was the most charming and
interesting of companions as we worked together
at tasks that frequently were purely mechanical in
four dimensional surgery



character we talked about a variety of subjects as
far away from mathematics or mechanics as tacoma
is from timbuctoo there was scarcely a topic
with which professor banning was not thoroughly
conversant his remarks revealed not only a sur-
prising mass of information but an authoritative
grasp of fundamentals as well -ie was equally at
home in discussing literature architecture music
philosophy anthropology philology physics adver-
tising law and theology i listened to him with open
ears absorbing wisdom as a sponge sucks up water

  one day i started something by introducing the
subject of spiritualism

  did you notice the article entitled the denizens
of hyper-space in this months issue of science and
psychology i inquired

  no i havent seen that yet who wrote it
  doctor hermann gesellschaft

  from heidelberg isnt lie

  i shouldnt wonder

  well what did he have to say

  im not sure i got it all clearly in my mind but
so far as  could make out he tried to explain certain
psychic phenomena by the hypothesis that spirits are
able to move through the fourth dimension among
other things he quoted a professor zoellner of leip-
zig who claimed that he had held a rope by both
ends and had seen a square knot tie itself in the
rope before his very eyes he accounted for this
seeming miracle by attributing it to spirits operating
in the fourth dimension

  professor banning vociferated zoellner was
a fool and a dupe like some other pseudo-scien-
tists i could mention he permitted himself to be
hoodwinked by mountebanks who posed as spirit
mediums

  it was the first time i had seen the professor for-
get his usual tranquillity and kindly manner of
speech perhaps it was his mathematical training
that made him so intolerant of the idea that any-
thing could exist outside the world of purely material
things

  i made the mistake of persisting too long on the
subject to me the explanations of gesellschaft
arid zoellner sounded quite plausible with so many
marvelous discoveries being made every day how
can we say that the existence of spirits-or anything
else for that matter-is impossible as polonius
said to his son there are more queer things in
heaven and hell than were ever dreamed of in your
philosophy 

  this provoked a snort of disgust from the pro-
fessor young man your quotation is as addled
as your reasoning appears to be it was not pol-
onius but hamlet that spoke those lines and he
said nothing about hell the correct quotation is
there are more things in heaven and earth horatio
than are dreamt of in your philosophy 

  i didnt need to look up this passage to be certain
that he was right he always was right

  the professor stamped out of the workshop leav-
ing me very much squelched and cogently conscious
of how superficial was my own paltry stock of
knowledge when compared with that of a real scholar
like banning

ten minutes later he was back at my side as
affable and agreeable as if nothing had happened
as a result of our assiduous efforts the four

dimensional forceps was gradually taking shape if
you will bear in mind that-just as a three dimen-
sional solid is bounded by two dimensional surfaces
-a four dimensional object must be bounded by
solids-you will get an idea of what the hyper-for-
ceps looked like for instance the parts that would
ordinarily be cylindrical in shape were made up of
thousands of small spheres grouped together like an
elongated bunch of tiny grapes you must remem-
ber however that these spheres cannot be placed
next to each other behind each other or on top of
each other one authority calls the fourth dimen-
sion through suggesting that the parts are placed
through each other this relationship in the posi-
tion of the parts that make up a four dimensional
object is one of the hardest things for the human
brain to grasp i must confess that without the aid
of professor bannings models and formulas i should
never have been able to construct the hyper-forceps

  the mention of formulas brings to my mind a
somewhat amusing incident which occurred when we
were approaching the fulfillment of our task one
morning professor banning came into the workshop
with a common wooden bucket tilted at a rakish
angle on his venerable head he looked so comical
that it was with the greatest difficulty that i sup-
pressed an inclination to giggle but the high respect
which i had always felt toward him forced me to
keep my face straight i fancied i saw him casting
surreptitious glances in my direction as if he were
trying to catch me grinning but not a flicker of a
smile did i dare venture

  finally he spoke i suppose you want to know
why im wearing this bucket maybe you think im
crazy but if this be madness theres method int
as our mutual inspiration the bard of avon puts it

  the hardest thing i have to encounter in working
out the -formulas for these hecatonicosiahedragons
and other polyhedragons is that i have to carry so
many figures and symbols in my head that in
itself would be easy enough if it were not for the
other figures and symbols which do not belong and
which come into my head from outside-thus mix-
ing up my formulas  recently discovered that
these extraneous figures cannot penetrate wood so
all i have to do is keep this bucket over my head
and the figures outside cannot get in

  one of these days ill have to borrow your
bucket i jested not to keep the outside figures
from coming in however for when i finally man-
age to get one of your formulas inside my noodle i
feel as if i need a bucket or something thicker-to
prevent the symbols that are inside from getting out
but if as you say the figures cant get through
wood perhaps im already protected

  this seemed to tickle the professor he was even
constrained to pay me a compliment-something ex-
tremely rare for him he put his hand on my
shoulder and said my boy theres nothing radically
wrong with your head at any rate it isnt swelled
and thats something

  i dont see how anyone could get swell-headed
over his thinking capacity when hes working with
a real thinker like you i came back at him

  thanks my boy but im afraid my mind isnt
working so well today this old carcass is pretty
well worn out those pains have been bothering me
again i think ill knock off for today can you get
along without me


amazing stories

   i told him that so far as his part was concerned
the hyper-forceps was practically finished it only
lacked certain finishing touches which were purely
mechanical in character and which i felt certain i
could work out alone

  from that day professor banning failed rapidly
in health it was as if the excitement of striving for
achievement which like a powerful electric current
had kept him going through months of gruelling
strain was suddenly snapped off-leaving only his
feeble old body to fight the ravages of age and
disease

  realizing the necessity for speed i worked with
merciless haste carrying my labors far into the
morning hours and grudgingly taking but an hour or
two each day for sleep and a bite of food

  at last the hyper-forceps was finished jn gen-
eral outlines it was not unlike an ordinary medical
forceps except that it had a rough appearance due
to the thousands of small solids with which it was
bounded for instance the portions that one would
expect to be cylindrical in shape were made up of the
small spheres which i have previously described and
their surfaces resembled those of a raspberry

  the really distinctive feature of the hyper-for-
ceps was that it had four finger-holes or handles like
those of a pair of scissors there was only one pair
of jaws however and they could be operated by
either set of handles working independently or in
unison when the two sets of handles were kept to-
gether the device worked exactly like an ordinary
three dimensional forceps but when the right hand
pair of handles was separated from the left hand
pair it operated a unique mechanism by means of
which the jaws were made to move at right angles to
each of the three dimensions of ordinary space-in
other words through the fourth dimension this
had been all figured out theoretically with such pains-
taking care that i felt absolutely certain it would
work-though i myself during all my work and
experimentation had never attempted the crucial
test

  it had been agreed between us that doctor mayer
was to be the first one to operate the hyper-forceps
through the fourth dimension and i was perfectly
content to concede that honor to him though it
was as strong and rigid as a similar article occupy-
ing only three dimensions i handled the hyper-
forceps as carefully as if it were a beaker of thin
glass filled to the brim with nitro-glycerine

  i took it immediately to professor bannings room
and told the nurse to notify doctor mayer that the
four dimensional forceps was finished he had just
completed an important operation and he still wore
his surgeons cap and frock when he entered the
professors room

  it was decided to put the hyper-forceps to the
test right then and there an inanimate object was
selected for the first trial doctor mayer picked up
a medicine bottle from the table by the bed drew
out the cork and poured the contents into the wash
basin he then took from his pocket a lead pencil
jerked off the small rubber eraser dropped it into
the bottle and replaced the stopper

  i shall attempt to take that rubber from inside
the bottle without removing the cork he explained
he placed the bottle on the table and reached for
the hyper-forceps which i handed him inserting
the tips of his right thumb and forefinger in one

pair of handles and those of his left hand in the
other pair he slowly manipulated the unique mechan-
ism which we had devised for converting motion in
three dimensional space into a corresponding move-
ment at right angles to each of the three dimensions

prepared as i was for something preposterous
to happen i was dumfounded to see the hyper-
forceps part by part melt into nothingness and dis-
appear from sight until only the handles were visible

  guiding the instrument entirely by guess work
the doctor moved it until he estimated that the in-
visible jaws ought to be somewhere inside the bottle
then he brought the two sets of handles together
as if by some weird magic the jaws of the forceps
became visible within the bottle but they seemed to
be suspended in space with  apparent connection
between them and the handles it was a simple mat-
ter to work the handles until the jaws grasped the
eraser by separating the two sets of handles again
the doctor caused the rubber to disappear com-
pletely after which he pulled the handles away from
the bottle and once more brought the handles to-
gether within a few seconds the eraser had been
lifted right through the solid walls of the bottle and
had been dropped on the table

  it works it works it works the professor
kept repeating in a shrill tone of voice he arose and
started jumping up and down on the bed cutting a
very grotesque figure in his outing flannel night shirt

  doctor mayer too was abnormally excited he
clapped his hands together and cried oh boy
like a kid who has just received his first air rifle

  it was not until afterward that i gave any thought
to the incongruity of their behavior in comparison
with my own i a callow youth forty years younger
than the professor and fully twenty-five years
younger than the doctor was as cool and calm as
an eskimo while these two dignified and mature
men were cavorting around like a couple of first-
graders

  cant you operate on me right away was the
professors first thought

  why  are you in very great pain 

  no in fact the pain seems to have left me
but i just cant wait for you to try out the hyper-
forceps on me

  unless its a matter of life and death id rather
put it through some more tests and incidentally get
more practice in using it before i attempt to operate
on you was the doctors sensible suggestion the
next thing id like to try is removing some object i
cant see like the inside of a nut

  would a peanut do  i asked perhaps i ought
to explain that i have a weakness for goobers and
i had a few in my pocket left over from a bag i had
purchased that noon

  just the thing exclaimed the doctor as i
handed one of the nuts to him

  again the hyper-forceps was brought into play
it took a little longer to accomplish the purpose this
time as it was necessary for doctor mayer to grope
around until he felt the kernel within the grip of the
jaws but he finally got hold of each of the two
kernels in turn and dropped them on the table

  like doubting thomas of the scriptures i wasnt
quite satisfied until i had made a personal investiga-
tion lifted the shell still perfectly intact and shook
it near my ear not a ghost of a rattle could i hear
four dimensional surgery



and the lightness of the nut was further proof that
the amazing feat of removing the kernels without
breaking the shell had been accomplished

  now for a trial on a living creature cried the
doctor lets go to my private laboratory i
think i have a good subject to experiment on
professor banning donned his bathrobe and slip-
pers and the three of us went to the laboratory
doctor mayers subject turned out to be wil-
helm a toggenberg goat which he had procured
as a subject for some medical experiments

  heres an opportunity to see whether the popular
jokes about the alleged cosmopolitan character of a
goats diet are founded on fact he jested this
time i think ill use my x-ray goggles you know
about them of course

 we both shook our heads	v

  theres not much to them same principle as
fluorescent screens but made in the form of goggles
for convenience i use them in connection with this
specially designed operating table you see it has
a roentgen tube arranged in such a way that it
throws the x-rays right through the body of anyone
lying on the table

  he lifted wilhelm to the table and strapped him
fast then he threw the switch that operated the
x-ray apparatus and adjusted the goggles to his eyes
in order that we might get the full benefit of the
experiment he provided each of us with fluorescent
goggles		 

  that the goat had some foreign substances in its
stomach was instantly apparent doctor mayer
picked up the hyper-forceps and worked the han-
dles again the instrument except for the handles
faded from sight this time doctor mayer seemed
to have considerable difficulty in placing the jaws
where he wanted them

  odd he exclaimed most peculiar feeling
like pushing something against some yielding sub-
stance or against a strong current of air or water
see in this direction it moves easily but i have to
use all my strength to make it move in the opposite
direction so absorbed were we in the experiment
itself that we made no attempt to explain this re-
markable phenomenon just at that time

  by exercising the utmost care accompanied by the
expenditure of considerable elbow grease the doctor
finally succeeded in forcing the hyper-forceps into
the position he desired then he brought the two
sets of handles together making the jaws of the for-
ceps appear inside the goats stomach then one
by one he removed the following objects an iron
bolt three shingle nails a tire valve cap a boys
marble and two safety pins through it all wilhelm
kept up an incessant ma-a-ah ma-a-ah ma-a-
ah but did not seem in the least bit distressed
during the moments when the four dimensional for-
ceps was exploring his internal workings

  well that ought to be proof enough that it
works professor banning remarked the only
thing that remains now is to try it on my gall-stones
i move that we do it right now

  doctor mayer seemed equally anxious to make the
final test all right he assented but first let me
send for my brother though i dont expect any
complications it may be best to have another surgeon
present

  doctor julius mayer responded promptly he
had of course heard all about the four dimensional

forceps from his brother and it took but a few
moments to explain the device to him

  it wont be necessary to make any special prep-
arations will it asked the patient

   i dont see the need of it except that i shall of
course sterilize the hyper-forceps you might get
a can of ether handy julius to use in case some-
thing unforeseen happens but judging from the
way that goat behaved im sure we wont have to
use it

clad just as he was in nightgown and bathrobe
professor banning stretched himself out on the
operating table doctor paul mayer turned on the
x-ray and adjusted the fluorescent goggles

  as he started to manipulate the hyper-forceps
he again remarked about the difficulty he experienced
in forcing it to move in certain directions and the
ease with which it moved in other directions how-
ever he finally succeeded in introducing the jaws of
the forceps into the patients body where we could
plainly see them with the aid of our x-ray goggles
after several trials he placed the jaws of the instru-
ment inside the gall bladder where the offending
gall stones could be dimly discerned all this time
the professor was fully conscious of what was going
on

  feel any pain the surgeon asked

   not a bit

  any unusual or peculiar sensation

  not yet ouch i did that time it didnt
hurt very much though

  i just pinched your liver a trifle the doctor
explained

  just then a horrifying thing happened the in-
side of professor bannings body made faintly visi-
ble by means of the x-ray seemed suddenly to melt
away a few seconds later his ribs faded from
view at the same instant doctor paul mayer gave
utterance to an agonizing cry my god theres
something pulling against me

  i jerked off the goggles and dashed to his side
exclaiming cant i help you

  no better keep away good heavens look
at my arms

  my blood almost congealed at the unspeakable
sight his arms seemed cut off at the elbows his
forearms and hands had disappeared completely and
so had the handles of the hyper-forceps

  i took another horrified glance at professor
bannings body just in time to see it fade completely
from view

  by this time all of doctor mayers arms and part
of his chest had melted from sight his brother
rushed to him and grasped him around the waist as
if to draw him back to safety he might as well
have tried to hold a wisp of smoke the last words
we heard from paul mayer were for gods sake
let me go with a moan of despair his brother
released his hold a moment later not a vestige of
either doctor paul mayer professor banning or the
hyper-forceps remained

  julius mayer and i stood looking at each other
both of us transfixed with horror in his face i
saw reflected all those emotions and sensations which
were racking my own body and brain-grief per-
plexity awe and-overshadowing all else-a ghastly
consciousness of stark fear


amazing stories

  he was the first to speak my god what shall
we do now

  perhaps wed better notify the police i stam-
mered

  good heavens dont do that not yet at
least let us first be sure weve done all we can
ourselves you know more about this wretched
four dimensional business than  do cant you sug-
gest something

  possibly they are still in this room but have
merely been made invisible was the only sugges-
tion i could think of

  acting on this hypothesis we groped about the
room exploring every portion of it with our hands
and arms we even placed a stool on top of a
wheeled stretcher such as are used for carrying
patients to and from the operating room and  vitood
on it and thoroughly probed the space for several
feet below the ceiling while mayer wheeled me about
the room

  i might have known how useless this procedure
was since a person who has moved far enough into
the fourth dimension to be out of sight would of
course be out of reach as well however anything
was better than doing nothing in the face of such a
dreadful and critical situation at the end of an
hour we had to admit our helplessness we could
understand the feelings of a naval officer who knows
that many fathoms beneath the keel of his ship there
arc thirty gallant men slowly dying horrible deaths
in the belly of a disabled submarine and yet is utterly
powerless to do anything to help them

  hopeless in his despair julius mayer finally said
i suppose there is nothing to do now but notify the
police im afraid that we are going to have a hard
time explaining how my brother and professor
banning disappeared

  well if im to be put through the third degree
i suppose  may as well change my clothes i was
still wearing the overalls and work shirt which was
my customary apparel while laboring at my mechan-
ical tasks

  leaving julius mayer to take care of the form-
ality of notifying the authorities i went to the work
shop where my street clothes were hanging

  as i entered the room where professor banning
and i had worked together for so many eventful
weeks i had a strangely weird feeling of dread-
such as a superstitious person might experience on
coming unexpectedly into a graveyard i expe-
rienced a mysterous consciousness that there was
somebody present who could not be seen or heard
then my attention was arrested by a most as-
tounding phenomenon a drop light which had
been installed to enable us to work at night was
behaving in an amazing manner the cord was
drawn to one side until it was almost horizontal
with the globe and shade apparently supported in
space in utter defiance of the law of gravitation
my eye searching for an explanation of this mir-
acle suddenly encountered something which i recog-
nized instantly as the jaws of the hyper-forceps

  if i was scared before i was thoroughly terror-
stricken now i could feel the goose flesh rising all
over my body and my hair began to bristle like
quills upon the fretful porcupine

  my first impulse was a cowardly one-undoubt-
edly prompted by the universal but sometimes das-
tardly instinct of self-preservation i wanted to

run away-to call help-to let someone else take the
risk of rescuing those two men whom i now knew
to be hanging out there in hyper-space with nothing
but two flimsy strands of electric wire holding them
to earth

  just what made me stay i am not sure but i
think it must have been the genuine love with which
i had learned to regard professor banning in
many ways he had treated me as a father would
treat his son and to me who had never enjoyed the
benefits of a parents care this had meant a great
deal

  that quick action was imperative and that there
was no time to go for help was immediately appar-
ent the cord was manifestly under a greater strain
thanit could be expected to bear very long and i
heard an ominous crack which told me that one of
the screws holding the fixture to the ceiling had be-
come loosened

  for one who never made any claims to strength
or courage it took a heap of nerve to do what i did
i could easily imagine just how lindbergh felt when
he stepped into the cockpit of the spirit of saint
louis and hopped off across the storm-tossed sea
not knowing whether he would ever come out alive
how was i to know what frightful fate might take
possession of me the moment i grasped the jaws of
the hyper-forceps would it be possible for me
to draw these two men back to earth or would my
own body be sucked into eternity just as the body
of doctor mayer had been pulled away before my
very eyes

  whatever was to be the outcome there seemed to
be nothing else to do so i leaped on the work bench
which was just high enough to enable me to reach
the jaws of the hyper-forceps i had presence of
mind enough to brace myself by a tight grip with my
left hand on the framework of a large machine drill
before i reached with my other hand for the hyper-
forceps

  just as i grasped it the last of the screws holding
the light fixture gave way and with a jerk that al-
most pulled my arm out of its socket the entire
strain was shifted to my body i managed to hang
on however and in a little while the stress was some-
what relieved it felt like holding the string of a
big kite in a strong wind-just a steady powerful
but yielding tug  found that by exerting myself
i was able to pull against the force that was resisting
me gradually more and more of the hyper-for-
ceps came into view until it was entirely visible
though i had fully anticipated what was to happen
next it seemed almost too preposterous to believe
when i perceived a detached human hand clinging
to the handle of the hyper-forceps and apparently
suspended in midair as i slowly drew it toward
me first the right arm then the torso and legs and
finally the head of doctor mayer loomed into view
his left arm except for a small part close to his
shoulder was still invisible however

  by this time doctor mayer was able to help him-
self by hooking one foot in a vise which was fastened
to the bench and with this extra bracing added to
my tugging on the hyper-forceps we quickly suc-
ceeded in drawing into the room the body of profes-
sor banning whom the doctor had been holding by
the hand

  you can easily imagine the relief which they felt
at being snatched from a horrible fate and you can
four dimensional surgery



also picture the joy with which i welcomed back these
two travelers into the mystic realms of hyper-space

  like a typical youngster i plied professor banning
with questions which he undertook to answer some-
what as follows as nearly as i can figure out
the part of the hyper-forceps which extended into
the fourth dimension must have been caught in some
current of cosmic force which was strong enough to
draw the entire instrument out of three dimensional
space pulling doctor mayer and myself with it

  naturally it will take me some time to work out
a truly scientific explanation but there were certain
indications which led me to believe that as soon as we
disappeared from your sight we began to lose our
gravitational attraction for the earth i put it that
way because as you doubtless know every object on
the globe attracts the earth itself just as trulyvas the
earth attracts it

  being projected into the fourth dimension had
the effect of relieving us from some of the gravita-
tional attraction of the earth but our bodies still
had momentum enough to carry us along with the
earth of course we did not lose all our gravita-
tional attraction for the earth but only a portion of
it had we lost all we would have been shot out
into space by centrifugal force like rocks shot from
a sling perhaps our position might be likened to
that of a piece of iron which is moved from in front
of a magnet to one side of it so that the lines of
force extended at a changed angle and with a dimin-
ished force

  after a few moments we noticed that we seemed
to be slowly drifting away from the place where we
originally left three dimensional space i account
for this by the assumption that our momentum was
being slightly decreased while the motion of the
earth was continuing at the same rate of speed our
bodies passed easily right through the walls of the
hospital building though everything was plainly
visible to us as we floared along we found that all
efforts to grasp or hold any three dimensional objects

were fruitless they melted in our fingers like so
much vapor our bodies also seemed almost trans-
parent and i found that i could easily stick my hand
right through my own chest without any discomfort
at the same time i found that when i grasped
doctor mayers hand in order to prevent us from
being separated i was able to hold it and to stay close
to him without being able to feel any sensation of
contact with his other hand doctor mayer still
clung to the hyper-forceps it was a good thing he
did hang to it because without its help we should
never have been able to get back

  in a little while we found ourselves floating
through the workshop i quickly realized that if we
continued to drift in this manner we would soon be
left hanging in space with the earth hurtling away
from us at a terrific speed it was then that i
thought of using the hyper-forceps as a means of
getting back acting on my instructions doctor
mayer grasped with the hyper-forceps the first ob-
ject he could reach it happened to be that light-cord
it was lucky you came in when you did because it
seemed impossible for as to pull ourselves back
without help please bear in mind that this explana-
tion is purely superficial and there may be some
flaws in it which i shall have to correct later when
i have had an opportunity to go more deeply into
the scientific aspects of the subject in general how-
ever i believe that the solution of the mystery is
about as i have given it does that make everything
clear or would you care to ask any more questions
this last sentence was a favorite of his which he in-
variably used in the class-room at the end of each
lecture

  theres just one more thing id like to know i
ventured what about your gall stones

  oh they are all gone thank heaven while we
were drifting around in hyper-space i could look
right inside myself and i could see those pesky gall
stones quite clearly so i just reached inside myself
and plucked them out with my fingers

consequently i turn the dial to the number one the professors hand went over to the switch and with a loudly beating heart i

watched him close the circuit


the disintegrating ray



 n the late spring of the year  there
 was a great deal of excitement in the
 science division of the state college
 it was based on the widespread rumor
 that professor clinton wild head of
 the physics department had recently made an in-
 vention calculated to revolutionize the world the
 exact nature of this invention was as yet in doubt
 but it was much discussed and everyone had his own
 ideas on the matter it may seem strange to the
 reader that the professor himself was not asked
 about his invention but he was a very grouchy in-
 dividual who was hated by the students whom in
 turn he cordially disliked at this time i was tak-
 ing a course in physics which was required for the
 completion of my course it was a subject that had
 always interested me and as i showed ascertain
 aptitude for this branch of science the prbfessor
 gave me the benefit of his special attention i do
 not mean to imply by this that he was fond of me
 he simply seemed to like me more than he did the
 others

   in spite of the fact that i was his favorite it was
 a great surprise when professor wild called me up
 at my home during the following vacation and asked
 me to come over to his house immediately as he
 had a matter of great importance to communicate
 instantly i scrambled into my coat and made a rush
 for his residence which was only a short distance
 away i arrived in a few minutes out of breath and
 keyed up to the highest pitch of excitement i rang
 the bell and the professor opened the door i was
 surprised to see that his countenance which habitu-
 ally wore a sullen expression fairly beamed with
 triumphant smiles however i was left little time
 for contemplation for he led me upstairs to his
 laboratory at once and showed me the great secret
 which he had hitherto so jealously guarded

   what i saw was a very large and elongated x-ray
 tube attached to a mercury exhaust pump it stood
 upright and at the bottom was a small iron crucible
 containing a silvery liquid which i supposed was
 mercury connected with the apparatus was a cable
 which led to a box at an end of the table on which
 the tube rested on one side of the box was a dial
 which gave it the general
 appearance of a radio set

 having seen this much i
 turned to the professor
 for an explanation

  you are probably
aware he began that all
of my recent work at the
college has had to do with
the structure of the atom

all my labors tended
toward a goal this goal was the disintegration
of the atom my ambition is realized in the machine
that you see here the disintegration is accomplished
by the action of a stream of electrons vibrating at
an exceedingly high frequency before i go any
further it might be just as well to review your
knowledge of the structure of the atom so that you
may better understand my invention

   an atom as you should know is composed of
 two essential parts first a nucleus which is prin-
 cipally a positive charge of electricity called a proton
 second a certain number of negative charges or
 electrons most of which revolve around the proton
 at a high rate of speed now the imoortant fact for

 you to bear in mind is that one atom differs from
 another only in the number of electrons it contains
 when an atom has many electrons it has a high
 atomic weight when there are few electrons the
 atomic weight is low now the interesting thing
 about it is that when all of the elements are ar-
 ranged in- the order of their increasing atomic
 weights each element has one more electron in one
 of its atoms than the one before it this number
 of electrons is called the atomic number for in-
 stance silver has an atom of forty-seven electrons
 so it has an atomic number of forty-seven from
 all this we see that the nature of an element rests
 solely on the number of electrons in any of its atoms
 so that if in any way we can alter this number we
 can change its identity after a great deal of ex-
 perimenting i found that this could be accomplished
 by subjecting the substance in question to the action
 of my high frequency ray

   i thought by this time that the lecture must be
 over but it was nothing to that which followed

   having taken a course in physics he continued
 you should be familiar with radioactivity and alpha
 delta and gamma rays of these the alpha ray is
 the weakest and least penetrating while the gamma
 ray is strongest and will penetrate one foot of iron
 also these rays differ from each other in their com-
 positions the alpha ray is a stream of positively
 charged helium ions the beta rays are simply a flow
 of electrons moving at a high velocity and the
 gamma rays are waves in ether the x-ray is simi-
 lar to the gamma ray but is not nearly so pene-
 trating now to explain my machine first of all
 i had an x-ray tube of special construction made
 for this experiment in this tube i produce an
 x-ray of an infinitely greater frequency than the
 ordinary one if you look carefully you will see
 two extra electrodes sealed into the glass a current
 with high voltage is made to go across the gap be-
 tween them this results in an electrical discharge
 like the one in a geissler tube as they both consist
 of a high frequency discharge in a vacuum this
 discharge or stream of electrons goes before the
 x-ray the electrons are swept from their path by
 the ray and movd along with it and at the same time

 a high vibratory rate is
 imparted to them so what
 we have now is a sort of
 super beta ray

  but i asked i was
 under the impression that
 an x-ray tube did have
 two electrodes across which
 passed a high tension cur-
 rent under high potential
 well he answered it
 has but this ray is known as the cathode ray the
 x-ray is caused by the impact of this cathode ray
 on some substance in its path called an anticathode
 the x-ray is famous for its ability to penetrate some
 organic substances but my ray will penetrate any
 substance organic or inorganic and more than that
 it is of so high a frequency that it will penetrate an
 atom

   the professor having made this amazing declara-
 tion drew himself up to his full height and regarded
 me triumphantly -

   what do you think of it 

   its great but i fail to see what relation it bears
 to the structure of the atom

 tjjfere is a short story of the atom which will be of
 j- - more than passing interest to you science teaches
 us that all materials no matter what they are are essen-
 tially of the same substances with the exception that a
 piece of metal for instance has more electrons than the
 gas hydrogen otherwise the two substances arc the same
 this fact has inspired the disintegrating ray which
 gives you a good deal of instruction in a palatable manner
	amazing

   you see said the professor that my ray which
 from now on i will refer to as the epsilon ray is
 composed of a stream of electrons vibrating ata high
 frequency when this ray is directed toward a sub-
 stance it penetrates each atom the electrons of
 the ray meet the electrons in the atom and there is a
 collision which results in the atom losing some of
 its electrons this loss changes the identity of the
 substance after several months of experimenting

 i found that the strength of the epsilon ray depends
 entirely on the voltage of the secondary discharge
 now i have it regulated so that the ray will remove
 just one electron per second i have also discovered
 another interesting fact namely that iron is not
 affected by my ray i am not sure just why this is
 so but i think it is due to the fact that the magnetic
 flux set up within the metal counteracts the action
 of the epsilon ray consequently i can tak the
 heaviest element known to exist on the earth urani-
 um and reduce it to iron then i can take the ele-
 ment with an atomic number just below that of
 iron the metal manganese and reduce it to hydro-
 gen but i cannot reduce uranium directly to hydro-
 gen in a way this is an advantage for i can make
 the apparatus that will be exposed to the ray out of
 iron almost any other substance would be disin-
 tegrated

 whati asked is the purpose of the pump
 that he explained is to extract the air other-
 wise it would disintegrate when i turned on the ray
 you said that the epsilon ray was of an excep-
 tionally high frequency

   oh yes extremely so

   how is this accomplished

   well that is a little invention of my own i use
 a radio tube specially connected with a coil system in
 which there is a set of coils each of a higher induct-
 ance than the one before it i cannot give you the
 details now as it is not yet perfected the whole
 is kept in that box with the dial that dial or
 rather the switch that it controls is another inven-
 tion of mine made for the machine it is really a
 sort of time switch which controls the length of time
 that the machine is in action as i said before the
 ray will take off one electron per second if you
 will notice the dial is numbered the numbers re-
 fer to seconds and when i wish to reduce a sub-
 stance to another element of a lower atomic weight
 i calculate the atomic numbers between them and
 turn the dial to that number at the center of the dial
 is a small button which starts the machine when the
 dial has been turned to the correct number i press
 the button and the ray acts for the required time as
 soon as it is over and the transmutation has pro-
 ceeded sufficiently the instrument automatically stops
 the ray and the action ceases now perhaps you
 would like to see my machine in action 

   i replied in the affirmative

   professor wild walked over to the tube and made
 some preliminary adjustments

   now what shall i turn the mercury into he
 asked turning to me

   try gold i suggested

   all right agreed the professor the atomic
 number of gold is seventy-nine and that of mercury
 is eighty so they are only separated by the differ-
 ence of one electron consequently i turn the dial
 to the number one the professors hand went over
 to the switch and with a loudly beating heart i
 watched him close the circuit

stories

   instantly the silvery liquid hardened and turned to
gold professor wild disconnected the epsilon ray
tube from the pump took out the gold and handed
it to me as he did so one of his peculiar smiles
overspread his face i took the gold and examined
it it seemed to be pure for it was very soft so
soft in fact that i could easily scratch with my
finger nail when i took it i noticed that it was
rather warm so i asked the professor the reason for
this

   when these electrons were put together it was
done at the expense of a great deal of heat and en-
ergy now that i tear them apart this heat is liber-
ated and leaves the element so it becomes cold but
the collision between the electrons that results when
i turn on the ray causes a vast amount of heat which
more than equals the cold or in other words the
endothermic reaction in which heat is taken in or
absorbed from the collision counteracts the exo-
thermic reaction in which heat is given off due to
the disintegration for a few minutes i stood still
lost in the contemplation of the wonderful machine
when suddenly i had an idea

   couldnt you prepare the undiscovered elements
that way

   yes but that idea occurred to me before and i
have done so already he went to a nearby cabinet
and returned with a few bottles

   you see said the professor that they are only
some more metals of the rare earths all of which are
very much alike he submitted the bottles to my
inspection and i saw that each contained a piece of
whitish metal that resembled aluminum he again
went over to his cabinet and this time brought back
a lead casket

   the contents of this box would have been worth
six or seven million dollars now it is worth
approximately fifty dollars he must have read my
mind yes it is radium which i can now make at
will from uranium

   by the way professor i broke in is there any
practical use to which you can put this machine
i mean could you possibly make it do anything and
be subject to your control

   theoretically it is possible but the main diffi-
culty lies in the fact that once the sudden disintegra-
tion is started it will spread and the whole world
will cease to exist so that you may better under-
stand let me liken the case to an immense pile of
gunpowder if you apply a spark to any point the
whole will go off but if some is separated from
the rest and then is lit it will not affect the rest
of the pile now i cannot separate the substance
that i use from the rest of the world but i can
insulate it in an iron sphere which metal as i have
told you is not affected by the epsilon ray of
course there is another puzzle that confronts me i
have no way of knowing how much power i will
get from the particular substance i may use to dis-
integrate so there is the danger of the whole thing
blowing up and wrecking the laboratory

   i dont see why there should be an explosion
i said

  to do so you must first understand the prin-
ciple of the thing in the process of releasing atomic
energy the atom is subjected to a powerful dis-
charge which instead of merely taking off a few
electrons completely blasts the atom to pieces so
that all of the electrons are left flying around this
gives rise to great pressure which can be used for
the disintegrating ray

many things it is this pressure that may cause the
explosion of course this is not the ideal way of
getting atomic energy for this would cause a great
deal of waste the best thing to do would be to
destroy the atom in such a way that all of the energy
that originally went into its making would be avail-
able however that is only a dream at the best
the other is the only practical one that i can see
just now i intend to work on the problem tonight

  that atomic energy is a great idea but do you
think that you can make it into a commercial
product 

  undoubtedly so just for one minute pause to
consider the enormous possibilities of atomic energy
everyone would be able to have his own power plant
which would supply all of the energy needed for
the day houses would be lit and warmed byvitomic
energy machines automobiles would be run by
atomic energy the probability that our supplies of
anthracite coal and oil will only last for about one
hundred years and fourteen years respectively is a
matter of grave concern but with the key to atomic
energy discovered all of these fears will be dis-
pelled my idea js to make a machine something
like my element-disintegrator only i will greatly
increase the power so that it will be able to blast
the atom completely instead of just removing a few
electrons as i explained before then i willhave to
develop a machine in which to use the atomic energy
of course the disintegrator will have a device with
which to control the strength of the ray so that it
will be able to do anything from disintegrating lead
to lighting new york for a week isnt it
stupendous 

  it is certainly the most wonderful creation of
the age but dont you see that if you put this inven-
tion out on a large scale you will destroy the ex-
change system of the world



  why no he said in a surprised tone  how
how  i echoed amazed at this scientific blind-
ness to practical facts how dont you under-
stand that if these machines are distributed gold
silver and other precious metals will be manufac-
tured galore at this some of his former enthusi-
asm took to flight but after a moments thought he
said

  oh well that is a very small matter for i can
fix the machines so that they will deliver a large
quantity of epsilon rays which will be too powerful
for partial disintegration if the machine is turned
on at all it will result in the complete destruction of
the atom but of course this quantity will have to
be slightly variable to produce different amounts of
energy now i fear that i have taken too much of
your valuable time so i will say good night how-
ever do not imagine that i am driving you away i
wish to make some experiments in an effort to pro-
duce atomic energy which may involve some risk
and i do not wish to expose you to any danger that
might arise

  i took my coat and went with the professor es-
corting me to the door i was not at all hurt or
mortified at my sudden dismissal for abrupt termi-
nations were characteristic of professor wild

  that was the last that i ever saw of the professor
and this newspaper clipping will explain his dis-
appearance

n relating this experience which i feel
is entirely unique i am determined to
avoid as far as possible all technical
terms and to resort to scientific ex-
pression only when it seems necessary
in order to convey an understanding of the strange
and otherwise inexplicable situations in which i
found myself

  i hope that this report will constitute an acceptable
excuse to my department for long absence from my
post of duty in the patent office and at the same
time become a document of some appreciable value
in the scientific world at the time when iny narra-
tive properly begins i had been working for some
years as an assistant examiner in the patent office
and while i had won no promotion i think i had
gained some recognition from the primary rxaminer
because of my proficiency in matters pertaining to
chemistry and physics

  but about the matter in hand

  about a year ago shortly before my annual vaca-
tion my superior primary examiner jameson
handed me an application for patent with the remark
that quinn of the mechanical department had called
it squirrel food in any case if the application was
in regular legal form we would have to prepare a
statement of reasons for rejection

  upon examination i found the application was
in regular form and that it was made through a very
reputable firm of patent attorneys duly admitted to
practise before the patent office by the commis-
sioner of patents

  the presentation of claims was made in a singu-
larly lucid and convincing style but the subjectmat-
ter-well there is perhaps no place in the world
where one comes in contact with so much that is
visionary incongruous or downright absurd as in
the patent office i thought i was quite immune to
surprise but this man was laying claim to an achieve-
ment positively fascinating
in its ridiculousness

  it seemed entirely im-
practicable and supernatu-
ral yet the presentation
was convincing and
gripped the attention i
read it again and again

the conclusions wen so
real as lo be quite disturb-
ing it was as if one
were to dream in the night of visiting some
enchanted land and wake in the morning to find the
bedroom cluttered up with souvenirs and photo-
graphs from the dream country feeling undecided
how best to proceed with the examination i laid it
aside to take it up another day but my mind kept
wandering back to it just as a sore tongue in spite
of all determination to the contrary will constantly
go back to explore a jagged place on a tooth so i
took it up and read again the preamble was in the
usual form setting forth the name of the appli-
cant place of residence and the title of the inven-
tion

transite

  this was followed by the customary form of
description

  my invention pertains to a substance hereinafter
referred to as transite this substance is designed to
be employed as an active agent in altering the so-
called atomic density of any substance

  the claims herewith presented have been care-
fully drawn and seem to be clearly and fairly allow-
able to wit-that this aforesaid substance when
applied or brought in contact with any other sub-
stance or matter of whatsoever nature will im-
mediately alter the structure and density of said
substance or matter to any desired degree by redis-
tributing the electrons revolving around each group
of protons constituting an atom or primary unit of
the matter treated

  then followed a careful description of involved
processes in language which was a curious mixture
of legal and scientific phraseology but extremely
convincing withal i was bewildered was this
necromancy was it transmutation or was it feasi-
ble invention

  i searched my mind for knowledge of the physical
structure of matter and to aid my own judgment i
repaired to the scientific library and research room

  in scientific american november  i found
an article by sir oliver lodge entitled within the
atom which was quite illuminating

  as near as i can quote from memory he said in
part we have gradually learned that electricity
exists in two forms negative which is called an
electron and positive which we are now beginning
to call a proton

  the material universe seems to be built up of
these two elements the atom is built on the general
pattern of a solar system that is to say it consists
of bodies arranged like the sun and the planets on a
very minute scale first of all we find a group of
protons welded together by a compact assemblage

of electrons this central
group represents the sun
and otuside it and at a
considerable distance from
it we find a regular series
of electrons revolving
round it like the planets
he speaks of the possi-
bility of dividing up these
little suns into smaller
units and distributing the
planets among them with this conclusion suffice it
to say that an atom of nitrogen can demonstrably be
broken up into helium and hydrogen

  so it appeared that the only difference between
the gases liquids and solids which after all are only
relative terms lies in the number of positive electric
particles forming the nucleus of their respective
atoms and these may be changed by artificial means
therefore in the case in hand nothing new is in-
volved only a practical apparatus for accomplishing
a transformation already known to science

being somewhat jaded by my past years work
and somewhat beset by that well known before-
hand vacation feeling i decided to lay the applica-
tion aside for two weeks and attack it with refreshed
faculties on my return but even at the old home-
stead a thousand miles from my work i could not
forget mr kingstons application

 tt ere again we have a characteristic story of great
 j originality scientists have steadfastly maintained
 that there must be other inhabited planes beside our own
 where these planes may be located few have ventured to
 predict but in the fourteenth earth we find some
 excellent as well as interesting science a charming tale
 well told that we know you will enjoy


amazing stories

  one day it dawned on me that his address was in
my own state only a few hours ride from me so i
decided to call on him hoping in that way to learn
something of his methods i expected to come in
contact with a well trained mind i was disappointed
the next morning when i found him out

  without asking me my errand or even ascertain-
ing my identity mrs kingston a florid pleasant-
faced woman of middle age in a state of acute anxiety
proceeded to tell me that her husband had failed
to come in from his laboratory at the usual hour
the previous evening and that she thought he had
probably taken a run down town for some neces-
sary article and had been unavoidably delayed
he seldom goes out without me but you know
when he gets submerged in one of his old in-
ventions he sometimes seems to forget he las me
she said with a half whimsical smile she had passed
a sleepless night after several trips to the laboratory
in the vain hope that he had left some note or clue
as to his whereabouts during the night she had
telephoned the police in the city of which this was
a suburb and had called up all the emergency hos-
pitals but to no purpose mr kingstons only
brother was already on his way by motor from a
neighboring town and she was momentarily expect-
ing the arrival of her mother who was bringing a
police investigator from town

  of course i offered my services and asked where
the laboratory was located she led me to the rear
of the house past a group of outbuildings to the
brow of a very steep hill overlooking a wide boule-
vard and beyond a recently staked allotment he
has it here to get the sun she remarked as we
descended the steep declivity by a few primitive
field-stone steps and entered the laboratory this
was very roughly built the roof being partly of glass
and nofloor as we entered we stepped into quite
yielding sand i remember that it struck me as
rather singular that such a very steep hill could be
composed of such unresisting sand but immedi-
ately other things claimed my attention and i per-
ceived that the place was fitted up very much like
the research department in a modern factory

  in the foreground was an upright piece of appa-
ratus about the size of the usual dentists x-ray
machine but apparently containing quite a number
of hoppers mixers and agitators as i stopped a
moment to regard this my hostess turned about say-
ing i am just going to take another look at the
sidehill it is so slippery this wet weather it is
just possible that he- i was left to finish the sen-
tence for myself

  i was alone before this strange device i had a
momentary feeling that i was standing in a presence
on a rack before the machine stood a small alumi-
num vat full of r translucent shimmering fluid on
the surface of which floated some dozen or more
small discs about the size of a ladys watch these
were prevented from coming in contact with the sides
of the vat by slender spines of chalk-like substance
projecting from all the walls i noticed that each
of the discs had a large number printed on its broad
side and with my mind more than half engaged
with the speculation as to the whereabouts of mr
kingston i took up one of the discs it was rather
spongy and surprisingly heavy in color it resembled
a very green apple

hardly had i lifted it from its insulating bath
than i realized the danger and impropriety of
such a rash act and essayed to lay it down again
but even as i did so i felt a spasmodic contraction
of the muscles of my fingers and involuntarily i
gripped the disc in a crushing grasp i looked wildly
around for help whether i cried out or not i do
not know then the objects in the room appeared to
be rising up and growing taller till with an indescrib-
able sense of horror i perceived that i was shrinking
in height and size then my sight commenced to
blur and i had a sensation as of descending in an
express elevator i remember thinking this must
be the sinking sensation which precedes death or
did this sensation prevail only under an anesthetic
and i thought how could it be known what one
experiences in dying since none come back to tell 

  gradually my mind ceased to function and i was
only conscious of a rapid falling motion at times
somewhat retarded and at other times greatly ac-
celerated this continued for what seenied a very
long time

  then i brought up with a mild jerk and as my
perceptions reasserted themselves found myself sus-
pended in the crotch of a low tree with my feet just
clearing the ground as i was struggling to free
myself i saw a little man about twenty inches tall
coming hurriedly toward me t decided to wait for
his help which he gingerly offered by supporting
my feet and i had no difficulty in climbing to the
ground it was then that i noticed that i was no
larger than my rescuer t thought this is only
a temporary hallucination and i shall come out of
it directly

  for a long moment we stood regarding each other
with surprise and wonder then the human aspect
of the situation asserted itself and sensing that cer-
tain amenities were required of me i thanked him
in as well-selected words as my muddled brain could
muster

  however the choice of words was of little mo-
ment for he accepted my gratitude with a courteous
gesture and made rejoinder in words that had no
meaning for me then as i gazedat my strange
surroundings-for they were indeed strange in every
detail-he stood wondering who i was and where
i came from then for the first time t perceived
that i still held the little disc in my hand turning
it over i read the number- as i stood gazing
at this very commonplace number a realization of
what had happened flashed upcn me and i said half
aloud so this is the fourteenth earth

  about this time my companion became aware that
i was out of my element-lost in a strange world
and with no apparent hesitation assumed the role
of conductor

  we were in what seemed to be a park or the
grounds of a large estate and he led me to a near-by
bench and bade me be seated then he took from his
pocket an instrument resembling a very small desk
clock this he held in his hand while he made a
few rapid adjustments and to my surprise began
talking to it he was apparently giving the listener
some instructions which i of course was unable
to understand then he put the instrument back
in his pocket and came and sat beside me in a friend-
ly manner almost immediately a small light ve-
hicle came swiftly along the drive in front and
halted directly opposite us
the fourteenth earth



   this was rather a surprising performance since
there was no driver and apparently no compartment
large enough to house the engine straightway my
companion entered and motioned me to a seat beside
him then by manipulating a small dial he started
the car rolling very gradually along the road di-
rectly we commenced to gain speed and i noticed
to my surprise that little flanges were coming out
on the spokes of the wheels there were no fend-
ers these- flanges seemed to catch the air and
help to propel us along then gradually two sheets
of metal started to unfurl on each side of the car
providing two wings each held rigid on top by two
rows of x-bracing that resembled a collapsible sup-
port for a desk telephone we now seemed to touch
the ground only very lightly

soon we came to a dense wood and while i
was wondering where the road could penetrate
this we rose evenly from the ground and passed over
it nor did we alight again until shortly before we
reached our destination

   we approached a city and passed many convey-
ances resembling our own as we drew near a
large building to some extent like a modern hotel
but much more ornate we came down and glided
along a smooth broad street passing along this
street were a great many people who observed me
with the keenest interest all were barefoot or
wore only sandals on their feet and their other
clothing appeared to be but a single garment it was
of quite heavy but soft material and reminded me
of a childs rompers it fitted only very loosely and
left off at the elbows and knees

   my companion conducted me into a spacious hall
and thence into a small but elegant library where
there were perhaps a couple of dozen people ab-
sorbed in what i took to be scientific apparatus my
guide called out in a very cheery voice and they all
gathered around us in great excitement and fell
to discussing me and especially my clothes which
they examined very minutely my companion ex-
hibited me in a very proprietary way i gathered
that they called him akon

   after a rather lengthy discussion akon mounted
a chair and made a little speech he punctuated this
oration with gestures now toward the others and
now toward me i supposed that he was introduc-
ing me and so when he was done i bowed and smiled
and tried to appear at ease which caused them no
little amusement the reason for this i did not dis-
cover till some time afterward

   then akon and two of the others conducted me
to a private apartment and after demonstrating the
various household devices for my comfort they with-
drew only to return in a few moments with an ample
and tasty supper which they placed before me and
took their leave

   i was hungry and tired and so amazed and con-
fused that i was only too glad to be alone the
food proved to be very palatable there was quite
a variety of it but i was unable to determine of what
any of the dishes were composed there was no
meat or vegetables in natural state everything
seemed to be cast in molds like manufactured
products

   soon i noticed that it was growing dark out of
doors and i wondered if i could compose myself
sufficiently to go to sleep i stayed awake till far

into the night trying to piece together my varied
experiences unable to decide what it all meant

  it was apparent that my body had undergone a
change of atomic structure assuming a greater
density this no doubt was the reason i had
become so much smaller

   it was also clear that i had descended into the
earth to a place where the atomic density of the sur-
face of an inner stratum was sufficient to sustain
me in my altered condition here all the people
were approximately my own size and no doubt of
about the same density i decided that the hardness
or density of the things of this surface must bear
about the same relation to the density of the next
stratum above as our common earthly things do to
the stratum that we call air and it occurred to me
that what i was breathing might be a great many
times more solid than granite rock i fell to won-
dering how it could be that the little disc had power
to change the proportion of the electrons to the
protons in all the various parts of my body yes even
to my very clothes and shoes and still permit me to
live to tell the story

then my thoughts wandered back to the dis-
appearance of mr kingston i had not thought
of him since morning now i had no doubt of his
fate like me he was taking up his residence in a
strange land i wondered what he looked like and if
i should ever see him i wondered what the number
was on the disc that he might accidentally have
grasped what an age it seemed since i left home
in the morning

   the next morning akon and his two friends came
for me and took me before a judge i waited with
no little anxiety while a lengthy document was react
and while the court questioned each of the three in
turn at length he seemed satisfied and after his
seal had been affixed to the document we were dis-
missed

   not for some weeks afterward did i learn what it
was all about it seems that on my arrival akon
had presented me as a gift of a scientific nature
to his club much as a public spirited man might
present a rare trophy to a museum and that they
had appeared before the court with a petition asking
that the trustees be made my guardians and cus-
todians assuming responsibility for my care and sup-
port and further promising the state the benefit of
any scientific discovery that might be made through
me upon returning to headquarters i was exam-
ined very minutely weighed measured and photo-
graphed i will here mention only three particulars
in which it was found that i differed from them
my toes although normal were much longer than
theirs in fact they had only vestiges of toes with
no nails their thumbs were decidedly further over
toward the middle of their hands than mine giving
a correspondingly greater dexterity they took par-
ticular notice of my tonsils and obligingly showed
me that they had none

   from these observations i decided that they were
a little farther along than we are a little older in the
scheme of existence

   the physical examination over they set to work to
find out what i knew some writing was placed
before me to see if i knew anything of a written
language and some balls were slowly counted i
took up a pencil and wrote a few words which of


amazing stories

course they could not read then i took up the
balls and counted them aloud in order to show them
i knew something of numbers at this they all
laughed and apparently called it a day

  after lunch akon took me for a drive in the
country although it was midsummer i was sur-
prised to see no crops growing and no sign of any
domestic animals there were a great many beauti-
ful trees and here and there i saw extensive land-
scape gardening there were very few signs of
industry there were many detached houses scat-
tered over the landscape all built of the finest stone
but everything was strange the trees were differ-
ent in shape and in foliage the grass of a different
green-and in fact everything about me was beyond
my understanding i came home at night more be-
wildered than ever the following day thy set to
work to teach me the language for it was evident
that i must learn to talk to them if they were ever
to learn much about my history akon undertook
to teach me himself he pointed to objects and
called them by name i repeated after him and
tried to remember as many as possible from day to
day for instance as we call ourselves people so they
called themselves feli

  directly i had learned a few words he introduced
their alphabet which i found very simple and easy
to write i applied myself diligently to the work
and within a few weeks found that i was making
gratifying progress at the end of three months i
could speak well enough to tell the society something
about my world and how i came to the fourteenth
earth accordingly i met with them one day in the
assembly room and told them very slowly and
laboriously and i have no doubt very awkwardly
a few of the things about our world that i thought
might interest them most i described as far as pos-
sible my accidental descent to their world within the
earth they heard me very patiently albeit with
some merriment and asked me a great many ques-
tions many of these i was unable to understand
and some i could not answer because my vocabulary
was still so limited however i gave them my
disc with the magic  on its side and asked them to
analyze it

  and now i could learn something of this strange
and wonderful country now i could ask questions
and understand explanations

i learned among other things that all food
and almost everything else used by the feli was
made directly from primary elements that they were
so familiar with the functions of electrons and pro-
tons that they were able to combine them with ease
to form any known substance-many substances
still unknown to us thus they were relieved of the
necessity of growing food stuffs and of raising do-
mestic animals they were relieved of the necessity
of mining as we practise it and of a great deal of
manufacturing they had reduced all production to
its lowest terms-power

  these electrons and protons which we associate
with electricity they associate with light they are
demonstrating that all power and all matter are only
different manifestations of light and they believe
that if they can discover what light is they will have
discovered the secret of life there all transporta-
tion is carried on by motive force generated at a cen-
tral plant and broadcast to what they call light

motors on the cars these motors were so small
that at first they escaped my notice

  of their religion i was able to learn but little
their word for the divinity is thegel they build
no churches and hold  public services but when
any progress is made in science or invention the
tangible evidence of this achievement is placed in a
small chapel or shrine and allowed to remain in
state so to speak for three days for instance if a
medicine is discovered to cure a heretofore incurable
disease a jar of the medicine is left in one of these
chapels for three days there is one of these little
buildings in each village and one for every few
thousand inhabitants in the cities i asked akon
about this peculiar custom but his answers were a
little vague that is for thegel he said is it
for him to see i asked and after some hesita-
tion he explained we do not know if thegel
sees or hears or ever has need of any of our earthly
senses but we hope that there is some kind of a
realization that we are making earnest effort in fact
some progress meager though it may be to avail
ourselves of the divine gifts that we are struggling
up to a higher plane of existence

  this was the only manifestation of any religious
belief i saw during my stay at first it seemed very
primitive to me and i wondered since their civiliza-
tion was manifestly older than ours that their re-
ligion should be so undeveloped their written
history with some few lapses extends back over a
period of approximately eleven thousand years com-
paring very favorably with our six or seven thousand
the ability to write or in some way to record events
is usually considered the factor that differentiates
the civilized man from the savage

was led to contemplate the evolution of our
religion and was surprised to find that instead
of growing in complexity it was gradually becoming
simplified in the old pagan days there were nu-
merous gods and goddesses some good some bad
and many of the natural phenomena such as floods
volcanoes etc were looked upon as activities of the
gods sacrifices of animals and even human beings
were offered with great ceremony huge temples
were erected it took the toil of a great nation for
generations to build some of them now all is
changed no more sacrifices only one god
buildings comparatively modest and ceremonies
more and more simplified the major portion of the
religious beliefs that were in vogue a few centuries
ago were now looked upon as ignorant superstition

   so it may be in the course of a few thousand years
our conception of the deity may become less personal
and many of our present religious beliefs may be
relegated to the realm of superstition and our quest
of the divine will may take the form of delving into
natures secrets

   as i gradually learned to read the scientific litera-
ture of the feli i found that they had long held the
theory that the earth was composed of successive
concentric layers of varying degrees of density and
approximately a thousand miles in thickness that
these layers became more dense and solid in inverse
ratio to their outer circumference that these various
surfaces were inhabited was still in the realm of con-
jecture even as we speculate as to whether or not
there are people living on the planet mars

   recently some scientists of recognized ability had
the fourteenth earth

claimed to have secured proof that there was human
life on at least one of these outer surfaces but their
announcements were received in about the same spirit
as we take the protestations of frederic meyers and
ledbetter that they are in communication with dis-
embodied spirits

   however my coming was now hailed as positive
proof that this theory was entirely tenable

   on one memorable occasion akon told me that he
was going to some distant reducing grounds to view
the reduction of large vats of material and invited
me to accompany him assuring me that it was a very
beautiful spectacle i accompanied him the more
gladly because it would afford me a few days respite
from my studies which i had been pursuing of late
with such absorbing interest that i was not a little
fatigued	

   we traveled for some days in leisurely fashion
stopping at various places of interest i only wish
that there were time and space to record all the won-
derful things i saw on that journey but if i did this
necessarily brief narrative must become a book and
that book a series of volumes so i must confine
myself to the object of our quest

   upon our arrival we took up our headquarters
at a point several miles distant from the works
here we found a large number of high-powered tele-
scopes mounted in temporary buildings resembling
the general lay-out of our erst-while popular
worlds fair expositions

   the next day we visited the works and my com-
panion explained their nature in technical language
that rather outstripped my understanding both of
scientific terms and of engineering processes how-
ever this much i gleaned the subsoil in this region
was rich in elementary substances such as we might
call minerals and from these substances which were
easily reducible they drew among other things large
stores of electrons and protons which they combined
in various ratios to produce nearly every known sub-
stance

a portion of territory was selected and
isolated from its surroundings by applying a
concentrated ray of decomposing light upon the soil
in such a way as to produce a wall or partition of
decomposed soil and subsoil from which certain
elements were removed this partition being a non-
conductor of heat and light served to form the
boundary lines of the tract to be treated the de-
composing ray was played over the surface rapidly
to form a layer of the same non-conducting material
to act as a cover or blanket to retain the gases created
in the reducing process

   the container or vat thus being completed the
work of reducing the enclosed mass was begun and
a combination of heat and light was projected into
the mass for weeks from huge generators working
night and day till the entire bulk to a great depth
was reduced to a molten mass of liquid charged with
gas like a submerged lake of fire in the present
case it was several miles in extent

   when all was sufficiently melted a huge rent was
made in the surface by means of explosives and the
gases allowed to escape as from a steel plant it is
this escape of gas that provides the spectacle so prized
by the feli

   the remaining material is then allowed to cool
and constitutes a vast storehouse which may be

drawn on for substances for months or in some
cases even for years at the appointed time we were
in a vast crowd among the buildings where the tele-
scopes were housed prepared for a rare treat

  suddenly without warning the entire sky was
illuminated after a few seconds the sound of the
explosion reached us we saw a column of fire and
smoke slowly ascending from the vat

   there were shooting rays like the northern lights
there were areas of dense blackness shot -through
at intervals with flashes of every shade of color that
the human eye can conceive there were blazes of
intense light such as accompany bursts of shrapnel
rolling clouds of sulphur-colored gases and in fact
such a display of light and color as one might expect
if all the oil wells and chemical factories in the world
were all rolled into one and all on fire at once then
as the flaming mass rose higher into the sky the
column gradually assumed more definite shape and
color in the center there arose a fiery column
shooting straight toward the zenith and on either
side of this a column of less brilliance as though the
incandescent column were surrounded by a cylinder
of fluorescence which rapidly faded toward its cir-
cumference this column was very large at the bot-
tom occupying a space of perhaps  of the circle
of vision

   this diminished in size as it ascended in the same
way as the rails of a railway appear to converge in
the distance when one looks along a level stretch of
track this column grew smaller and smaller till it
finally disappeared at the limit of vision

   after gazing for some time at this scene entirely
engrossed by its magnitude and splendor i became
aware that i was alone my companions and those
around me having gone in to the telescopes

   i followed after them and found them gathered in
circles around the great mirrors that reflected the
magnified images from the gigantic instruments as
i approached the one by which i had previously been
assigned a seat beside akon i saw a spectacle of
brilliance and grandeur rivalling anything i had ever
experienced there rose the luminous column not
as a tapering cone disappearing in the darkness but
as a splendid creation of light and color standing out
clear and magnificent in every detail

how shall i describe it words can only con-
vey a most imperfect and inadequate picture
in general effect it was as though you would place a
number of very tall and graceful vases one on top of
another vases somewhat enlarged at the bottom and
tapering toward the top

   i remarked to akon that this seemed to me to be a
very peculiar phenomenon he agreed with me and
said that these enlargements occurring at regular in-
tervals were thought to be caused by the varying
density of the successive layers of the earth since
the volume of any gas varies in direct ratio to the
pressure that confines it whenever this gas ascends
into a stratum of diminished density it expands pro-
ducing the bowl of the vase then as it rises to a
greater height it naturally appears to dwindle in size
forming the neck of the vase till it passes through
another stratum expanding into another bowl

   almost mechanically i counted the successive en-
largements there were thirteen of them then for
the second time since my arrival in this strange land

i said this must be the fourteenth earth and
	amazing

 in spite of the gripping interest of the spectacle my
 thoughts took a momentary excursion back to the
 little numbered discs in mr kingstons laboratory
 and i wondered if the number  on my tragic selec-

s tories

 basic substance but to re-arrange the electrons in

 complex substances without destroying the shape and
 without reducing it to its primary elements was
 somewhat in advance of their progress

 tion had meant a definite world to the scientist

   then as i pondered over this the magic stem
 suddenly blossomed at the top or rather exploded
 like a beautiful rocket in a giant pyrotechnical dis-
 play  and a murmur of awed appreciation went up
 from those around me bringing back the scene on
 the old parade grounds when i was a boy watching
 fire works when some piece of special merit would
 meet with the approval of the crowd

   the top of the column had at length reached the
 surface of the earth where i had once lived and
 where the heavy gases had come in contact vith our
 atmosphere which was much rarer than the stratum
 below	 

   here were great luminous clouds and vivid scintil-
 lations like many-colored stars and streaks of livid
 incandescence streaming away in crooked contours
 but in a general way outlining an upright very flat
 cone these streams faded in the distance till they
 merged with the darkness of the sky the illumina-
 tion was so brilliant that after gazing for some time
 i was obliged to shut my eyes to rest them and as
 i did so  became conscious that this picture bore a
 striking likeness to something i had seen or known
 about long ago that squat cone-the fading
 streams-then like the lifting of a curtain it became
 clear to me and there flashed into my mind another
 picture i saw a fiery volcano belching forth death
 and destruction with the white-hot streams of lava
 pouring down the mountain sides engulfing homes
 and cities and boiling into the sea i saw a multi-
 tude of people fleeing in terror for their lives and
 others faint from suffocation or perishing miserably
 from the heat and hovering over all a great pall of
 black smoke while a rain of cinders and ashes de-
 scended on the country for miles around

   sick and frozen with horror i opened my eyes to
 meet the beaming countenance of akon happy in
 the contemplation of this thing of beauty on the re-
 flector seeing all was not well with me he hastened
 to ask solicitously what was the matter for the life
 of me i could not think of one word of that wretched
 language with which to answer him

   as one turns away from a revolting scene i turned
 away from the mirror it no longer held any fas-
 cination for me my companion soon followed me
 and when i had composed myself enough to regain
 some command of his language i told him how the
 by-product of their industry causes our volcanoes
 and of their havoc and destruction

   he was deeply concerned although at first a little
 incredulous however he promised to report the
 matter to the scientific society and thought perhaps
 some means might be devised to ameliorate its ef-
 fects or possibly to do away with the eruption al-
 together

   very soon after our return from the reducing
 grounds the penyon society my adopted parent or
 rather guardian decided to make an attempt to re-
 turn me whence i came my sudden appearance had
 stimulated the entire scientific world to an intense
 activity in the study of the possibilities of an artificial
 redistribution of electrons in the atom as i have
 said they were already proficient in arranging the
 electrons and protons in the proper ratio to form any

the late promulgation of the einstein theory
created a somewhat analagous stir in our world
of science

   under the urge of this stimulus the penyon so-
 ciety in cooperation with other research workers
 had been making some very remarkable progress and
 they now decided to put their knowledge to the test
 by constructing an apparatus that would revivify my
 little  disc in such a way that it would undo the
 change formerly wrought in my atomic structure
 they all set to work with such vigor and enthusiasm
 that hardly a month elapsed before all was ready for
 a test of their success

   then we again presented ourselves before the
 magistrate and in language which i was now able
 to understand the court was petitioned to relieve the
 penyon society of its responsibility of guardianship
 and permit me to submit my person in the interests
 of science to the uncertain action of this admittedly
 dangerous process this petition was readily granted
 and the following day was set for my departure
 the penyon society banquetted me and bade me
 bon voyage with fitting ceremony and akon bade
 me good-bye with much feeling and very evident re-
 luctance

   at the appointed hour in the presence of a great
 multitude i approached the insulating vat and grasp-
 ing old  with a resolute hold i lifted the disc from
 its bath i reflected how different this was from
 my solitary departure a year ago almost immedi-
 ately i became aware of a rising and expanding feel-
 ing and amid great shouts from the people i began
 my ascent

   at first slowly and then with gradually accelerat-
 ing velocity i was soon travelling at great speed and
 directly commenced to experience that sense of be-
 numbed faculties that i had felt on the downward
 trip and i was only conscious of a long period of
 upward movement

   then when i finally emerged from the gloom i
 had a moment of clear consciousness then i per-
 ceived that i was restored to my normal size and
 that i had popped into the air like a fragment of some
 very light material when it rises from a great depth
 of water gaining enough momentum to carry it clear
 of the surface

   for a fraction of a second i hung suspended a few
 feet in air and then dropped with a breath-expelling
 plop to the ground the next thing i knew i was
 in a comfortable bed here in this hospital as i am
 told in the little town of wilby of course notrace
 was left of the manner of my coming and i have
 been obliged to resort to fiction to account for having
 been found in a bruised and unconscious condition
 in the middle of a plowed field so i have explained
 that i fell only a few feet from a balloon which i
 had invented and with which i was making a trial
 flight

   i have no desire to be transferred to the psycho-
 pathic ward where i surely would go if i were to be
 so rash as to tell them the truth about my adventure

i should no doubt be judged insane without further
examination and then would ensue no end of compli-

dr wentworth joined with the nurses in general merriment over the psychological operation which he was performing

         om wilson was a worm he knew
he was a worm but in spite of the
knowledge he seemed unable to remedy
the condition as he walked toward
the warehouse where for the past ten
years he had held the position of shipping-clerk he
reflected with bitterness on his down-trodden brow-
beaten hen-pecked existence here he was a man
of forty in good health with an inferiority complex
so strongly developed that he was forever cringing
and debasing himself be-
fore people it was only
day before jesterday that
he had said yes sir to the
colored porter on the train
as he and his wife were
returning from the beach

  it made her mad and
she promised to bounce a
rolling pin off his head
when she got him home

    he was hen-pecked at home by his wife and brow-
beaten and bullied at the warehouse by every one
with whom he came in contact from the truck driv-
ers to the foreman tom was really not a bad sort
at all he was of medium height with a round jolly
face and a bit of girth around the equator he would
have liked to be friendly with every one but his
advances were usually received with contempt by his
associates

    a tremendous piece of luck had befallen him the

 day before-which was

--- the cause of his unusual

introspection and self-
contempt on this particu-
lar morning just before
his lunch hour on the
previous day he had re-
ceived a telephone message
asking him to call at once
on a certain firm of law-

-- r-		yers hurrying through

but fortunately in the stress of getting supper she his lunch he repaired to their offices and was in-

lorot jt-	formed that he was heir to the estate of an uncle

 t t is well knozvn that some of the greatest cures have
 been effected psychologically the annals of medi-
 cine are full of such cures it is also interesting to note
 that sometimes the technique used by doctors in obtain-
 ing cures must be elaborate in order to bring about the
 expected change how one doctor went about this is
 most interestingly told by our author

amazing stories

who had recently died in alaska they stated that
the estate approximated one million dollars and
while it would take a few months to comply with
legal formalities before the estate could be turned
over to him they would be happy to be allowed to
advance him any sums he might require

  on the impulse of the moment he touched them
for five thousand dollars not because he had any
particular use for such a sum but just to convince
himself that he was awake and listening to a true
story he swore the lawyers to secrecy for no very
well defined reason except that he feared to have
it become known that he was rich until he had time
to adjust himself to the idea

  during the afternoon after returning from his
meeting with the lawyers whenever jim lang the
foreman scorched him with an extra nast bit of
sarcasm he would slip a hand into his pocket and
finger the crisp certified check for five thousand dol-
lars and wonder what fat jim would say if he flashed
it before his eyes then after supper that night
when ann his wife gave him a terrible tongue lash-
ing for breaking one of her blue saucers while wiping
the dishes he almost but not quite grinned in her
face as he fingered the check in his pocket and he
wondered what she would say if he handed her the
check in a nonchalant manner saying

   here ann old girl take this and buy all of the
blue saucers that you want

   a few evenings later when he had finished wiping
the supper dishes he told ann that he was going to
step across the street to dr wentworths home to
consult him about a pain he was having in his side

   pain fiddlesticks snorted ann youve been
stuffing yourself with pie for lunch again i suppose
now dont you stay over there gossiping with that
doctor because i want you to scrub this kitchen
tonight

  yes my love answered tom meekly i wont
be long

   doc said tom when he was seated in dr went-
worths library i ran over to have a little talk with
you as my friend rather than as my doctor i told
my wife that i was coming over to consult you about
a pain in my side but that was a lie for i never
felt better in my life i dont want you to mention
it to any one for the present but i have just fallen
heir to one million dollars from an uncles estate
here is a check for five thousand the lawyers gave
me and they said i could have more if i wanted it
while they were attending to the legal requirements
preliminary to turning the estate over to me i never
before worried much about my inferiority complex
as you have called it but now when people find out
that i am rich they will jump on me harder than
ever trying to brow-beat money out of me i thought
perhaps you could suggest something to help me
well tom said the doctor i am glad to hear
that you have fallen heir to a fortune now about
your condition as i have told you many times it is
largely mental you are in good health and a rather
strong man for your size in a matter of fisticuffs
you could give a very good account of yourself if
you would fight do i understand that you have told
no one of your inheritance not even your wife
no you and the lawyers are the only ones who
know doc you have an international reputation for
performing unusual operations like those stomach
exchanges for instance cant you do something for
me-change something in me that will rid me of

this craven fear of everyone who says boo to me 
if you are to be cured by an operation said
dr wentworth as he looked fondly at him there
is only one that i know of that would fit your case
namely an exchange of hearts-the exchange being
made with a man possessed of what is usually re-
ferred to as a fighting heart 

utjut my goodness doc you couldnt exchange
d my heart  with another mans without killing
us both could you 

  oh yes said the doctor with a smile that
operation is not at all uncommon now you see in
theory we surgeons have always been able to per-
form that operation successfully but in actual prac-
tice the patients always died this was true up to
a couple of years ago when doctor zambi the noted
french scientist invented or discovered xerolla
this chemical is a very powerful anesthetic which
enables us to place a patient in a state of complete
suspended animation for a period of forty-eight
hours with no deleterious reaction

   dr zambi also invented or discovered collo-
diansy a combination of chemicals which when ap-
plied to the lips of an incision causes it to commence
healing rapidly at once-is almost healed in twelve
hours entirely healed in twenty-four hours and in
thirty-six hours the scars are almost invisible with
those two agents xerolla and collodiansy it has be-
come such a simple operation that we no longer con-
sider it in the major class in thirty-six hours the
veins and arteries where we have made the connec-
tion with the new heart are completely healed and in
forty-eight hours when the patient comes out of his
deep sleep it is almost impossible to find even the
cicatrix of the incision in the chest

   that sounds fine but could you find a man with
what you call a fighting heart that would be willing
to make the exchange  then too i wouldnt want
any one to know that i had undergone such an
operation

   yes i could find a man willing to make the ex-
change for a price that is where your new wealth
will come in handy the exact nature of your opera-
tion need not be known it could be given out that
you had undergone an operation for the removal of
your appendix

   doc said tom earnestly above all things my
wife must not know the nature of this operation
that can be arranged tomorrow morning do
not go to work complain to her of pains in your
abdomen and have her call me in i will advise your
removal to the hospital later she can be informed
that an operation for appendicitis is necessary

   the following day these plans were carried out and
from the hospital tom sent for his lawyers and se-
cured a further advance of funds the next three
days were spent by dr wentworth so he-informed
tom in finding just the right man for the exchange
operation during these three days ann showed a
solicitude for toms welfare that surprised and
touched him she called at the hospital three times
each day but by the doctors orders was only allowed
to remain a few minutes

   on the morning of the operation the doctor said
to tom

  in these exchange operations we think it best
that the patients do not meet as it might be a source
of embarrassment later but i am going to give you
a sight of the man from whom you will acquire the
the fighting heart



fighting heart because he is such a fine specimen
of young manhood

  the doctor led him down the corridor and into a
room in which was a door leading into the next
room the upper part of this door was of glass
covered with a lace curtain

  look through the curtain said the doctor the
man with whom you are to make the exchange is
standing in the next room

  tom looked through the curtain and saw a fine
looking young man apparently an athlete he
seemed almost like a composite picture of firpo
dempsey and tunney

as they walked back up the corridor tom said
that sure is a fine looking young fellow ill
bet he can whip his weight in wild-cats but say
doc when he acquires this heart of mine howvill
it affect him

  it will have no effect whatever on his actions
there is nothing organically wrong with your heart
as i have often told you your trouble is largely
mental this man has the fighting mental attitude
and will carry on just as he has before and your heart
will function perfectly for him

when tom came out of his deep sleep and dr
wentworth informed him that the operation
was a complete success he was as happy as a lark
a week later the doctor said to him

  tom my conduct in the matter of your operation
has been most unethical not letting your wife know
and so on but out of friendship to you i am going
to continue on the same lines i am going to take a
months vacation and you and i are going to ber-
muda without your wife when we return in a
month you will be in top-hole form we leave to-
morrow so make whatever explanations you think
best to your wife

  tom found unexpected difficulty in persuading
ann that the trip to bermuda without her was the
proper thing but finally with the doctor to back him
up he convinced her

  the month at bermuda with dr wentworth was
a revelation to tom who had found little time for
play in his life the doctor taught him to play golf
and they put in their days golfing swimming and
fishing

  on the morning of their return to the city tom
said to the doctor

  doc the man from whom i got this heart must
have been a fighting fool for i am never so happy
as when i am about to get into a scrap sure differ-
ent from the way i used to be

  use a little discretion tom dr wentworth an-
swered smiling quizzically at him if you dont
one of these days some little fellow will come along
and half kill you

tom went at once to his home greeted his wife
rather casually changed to his working clothes
and reported to the warehouse for work

  as soon as jim lang the foreman found a mo-
ment of leisure he approached tom who was seated
on his high stool at the billing desk and took up his
usual line of bickering and brow-beating

  say runt said lang do you think we are
going to wait all day for those bills-of-lading

  now fatty said tom looking the foreman over
with a mischievous twinkle in his eye if you think

you can make these bills out faster climb on this stool
and go to it

  why you insignificant pencil pusher roared the
surprised lang for never before had this worm
dared to give him a sharp answer if you give me
any of your lip ill knock you for a row of ash cans
atta boy fatty said tom with a grin as he
climbed down from the high stool thats the talk
ive been waiting for now just for that im going
to give you a smack

  tom slapped him with his open hand but so
forcibly that the unprepared lang sat down with a
bounce

  you will notice my dear fatty said tom as he
stood- over him that i merely patted you with my
open hand

  when i get up said the fat foreman as he
struggled to get his feet under him i am going to
tear you apart

  oh no you are not answered tom laughing
happily because i am next going to lay my fist care-
fully on the side of your jaw to help pay for all these
years of misery you have caused me

  when lang finally succeeded in regaining his feet
he made a rush at tom swinging his arms wildly but
missed him and received a resounding whack on the
jaw that dropped him as though he had been shot

  now you truck-hogs yelled tom at the truck
drivers who were looking on in amazement at this
unexpected conduct of the heretofore worm of a
shipping-clerk carry this carrion over to that cor-
ner out of the way and then snap into getting these
goods for the depot on your trucks lively now
the truck men went to work with a will loading
the packing cases on their trucks casting side-long
glances of bewilderment at the belligerent shipping-
clerk

  here you jones called tom to one of the men
who had paused for a moment to rest what do you
think this is a picnic

  the man looked at him insolently spat on the floor
hitched up his pants but made no move to resume
work

  i was just hoping that you would gfve me an
excuse said tom with a happy laugh as he walked
toward him its many years you have been step-
ping on the worm now the worm has turned
with that he struck the fellow a clout on the ear
that caused his head to rock and made him see stars
get busy chortled tom with huge enjoyment
or ill give you the other barrel

  one barrel was evidently enough for the fellow
proceeded at once to load his truck as tom re-
turned to the billing desk he noticed mr davis the
president of the company standing just back of it
with a grin on his face

  when the last truck was loaded tom addressed
the men

  you truck-hogs have been taking entirely too
much time to make the trip to the depot and back i
am giving you just one hour to make the round trip
one half of the time that you have been taking the
man that is late in getting back is going to have a
fight and i will add that there are three of you that
i am hoping will be late now get going

  tom said mr davis the president as he was
climbing back to his stool come into my office for
a minute i want to talk to you

  i noticed how you handled those drivers said
the president when they were seated in his office


amazing stories

you have been with us for ten years and in ap-
preciation of your faithful service i am going to
promote you to foreman at double your present
wages

   oh you are said tom with a menacing glare
its taken you a damned long time to find out what
a faithful fellow i am you have never raised my
wages a nickel since i have been with you you have
never even seen me in the warehouse enough to say
good-morning i dont like you i dont like your
face and especially your nose i have dreamed many
times in the past years of pulling it and right now is
when i make one dream come true

   tom reached across the desk and took a firm grip
on the presidents aristocratic nose and gave it several
severe tweaks then he slowly twisted it until the
tears ran down the mans face and a groan of anguish
escaped him

   bye bye old dear said tom as he walked to
the door as barney google would say i hope you
dont feel hurt 

he walked home through a drizzling rain and
when he entered the house he smiled as ann
greeted him with her usual avalanche of abuse

   say do you think you are coming into a barn
demanded ann go right back out on the porch
and wipe your dirty feet do you think i have
nothing else to do but clean up after you 

  whom do you think you are talking to ex-
claimed tom as he took hold of her shoulders and
shook her until her teeth rattled ill teach you to
stand around jawing instead of getting my supper
now get it on the table and make it snappy and after
this you had better have it ready when i get home
whats the idea of a tired man having to wait for his
supper when he gets home from work

   sit down dear whimpered ann as she banged
pots and pans around on the stove in mad haste ill
have it on the table in just a jiffy

   as tom ate his supper in dignified silence she
hovered around him like an uneasy mother

   is the soup hot enough tom dear she asked
wouldnt you like another piece of this pie its
your favorite kind

no more said tom glancing at her in astonish-
ment for it had been-a long time since she allowed
him to have more than one piece of pie at a meal
get these dishes washed and wiped in a hurry

he told her when he had finished then come into the
front room i want to talk to you

   all right dear ill be through in a moment but
she said not a word about his wiping the dishes
which had been his custom for years

  when she came into the front room she seated
herself on the arm of his chair ran her fingers
through his hair then pressed her cheek against his
head he tilted back his head so that he could see
her and began

  now ann- but got no further for she

stooped swiftly and pressed her lips to his in a kiss
such as he could not remember receiving since the
days of their honeymoon finally she slid into his
lap and he proceeded

  ann i am now a wealthy man an uncle whom i
had not heard of for years died in alaska and left me
a fortune i have engaged passage for you and me
on a boat that leaves for europe in three days to-
morrow  want you to go to a beauty parlour get
your hair bobbed and your face prettied up like other
women do then get yourself some proper traveling
clothes you can get more when we reach paris
you have gotten too careless about your appearance
you are a darned good-looking woman and need only
fix yourself up properly which is just what you must
do in the future

  all right my love cooed ann with a happy
laugh ill get dolled up tomorrow so you wont
know me

  three days later they stood by the rail and waved
to dr wentworth as their ship glided away from the
wharf

  oh i almost forgot said ann handing tom a
slip of paper dr wentworth asked me to give this
to you after the ship left the wharf

  tom took the paper and examined it with a
puzzled expression it was a certified check made
out to dr wentworth for the sum of five thousand
dollars tom had gotten it from his lawyers for the
doctor to pay for the operation he turned it over
and on the back it was endorsed pay to tom wil-
son and was signed dr wentworth

  below the signature was written in the doctors
fine hand i cant accept this tom wouldnt be
ethical as i have not yet hung out a shingle as a
psychologist but the point is you are cured even if
you still have your own heart-which by the way
you have proved to be equal to any

 ourselves

-by leland s copeland

born of earth and sunshine
drawn from ages past
you and i inhabit
planet three at last

savage saint and thinker
mingle in our mind
swayed by ancient urges
our wee lives unwind

changed to light and stardust
we at length must drift
over void and darkness
down a stellar rift

ere we travel blindly

  through the starred abyss
seize and share the joy of
that expanse and this
  smoke rings

bj qeorfe jc ipcmrt

a low hiss arose as the gas escaped from the well and there rose into the air the most perfect ring i had ever made so black and opaque
that it was more like a ring of steel than a flimsy gas ring and then i saw something that froze the blood in my veins high above

 the rising ring was the long slender shape of a zcppelin

ihe quiet of the dreamy sunday evening
was shattered by the shrill rise and fall
of the siren of the fire-fighting patrol
as it dashed through the residential sec-
tion of the little town towards the road
leading into the country the heavy trucks jounced
and pounded their way down the sandy road in the
direction of the red smudge
that lit up the heavens

soon the machines dashed
into a farmyard and slid
to a groaning stop near a
large three-story barn
flames roaring and writh-
ing from its numerous
apertures the firemen
dropped the end of a hose
into the well and began
pumping water into the
burning structure a few
minutes later the pumps
sucked air-the well was
dry unable to do any-
thing more the men stood
around staring fascinated	

into the flames that licked the inflammable wood and
rose in a crimson tower against the starry heavens

high up on the burning barn one of the men
spied a figure with arms crossed and contemplating

 i t ere is one of the best short scicntifiction stories
 jljl we have published in a long time if you have ever
 blown smoke rings with your cigar cigarette or pipe
 you may have wondered about the science behind them
 these smoke rings by the way have been used a great
 deal the latter part of the last century to fight hail
 storms particularly in europe especially in italy can-
 nons trained vertically pointing to the sky could be seen
 practically near all tire large vineyards ready to be shot
 off at the appearance of black clouds the cannons
 themselves were of the usual mortar type with a f unnel-
 shaped mouth extension of steel about  feet high
 smoke rings of tremendous power were generated with
 the shooting off of the cannons although used for
 many years these cannons have gradually fallen into
 disuse because the effects were not all that could be
 desired

the growing crowd below the man shouted his
discovery ladders were quickly raised and placed
against the barn a fireman was about to ascend
when the figure raised his hands in a-commanding
gesture and shouted go back you fool at the
same time he kicked the ladder away from the cor-
nice heeding the command the men dropped back

                       the man disappeared and
- soon reappeared with a
small steel box which he
tossed to the ground
there was a scurry for it
but the chief of the fire-
men managed to get pos-
session of it the man re-
turned to his former posi-
tion-a proud spirit await-
ing his doom arms crossed
and head high-outlined
against the advancing
flames

a dull rumbling warned
the spectators of the im-
mediate collapse of the
barn all eyes still riveted
upon the proud figure the walls crashed inward rais-
ing great clouds of sparks that circled over the burn-
ing ruins a great sigh arose a man had died resist-
ing succor why that question was uppermost in

nos


amazing stories

the minds of all who had witnessed his death

  when the answer revealed by the contents of the
steel box came a few days later the whole world
knew-gasped with surprise and amazement-and
disbelief it bordered upon the fantastic yet it was
true-as true as the fact that night follows day

  here is the story revised and checked by the
government officials who say that this revelation has
cleared a puzzling mystery and is bound to bring
about a great change in the matter of future war-
fare

  

have done it but at what cost intending
that it should be used to protect my own nation
it has struck back killing and injuring those who
are my own countrymen and friends oh that man
could see what fate has in store for him how could
i know that fate would hurl into the path of my
instrument of destruction while i was testing it the
thing i would not for a moment have thought of in-
juring fate

  let me first say a word or two about myself and
my history i am wilbur gunderson poor and un-
educated beyond the country grammar school my
parents were of the average farm type living in
southern michigan having had nothing but the
meager education that the country school could give
i went to the city of chicago where i attended night
school and picked up a rather substantial education
when the war broke out i went to france as an
anti-aircraft gunner between sighting and shooting
at enemy planes i would lie on the ground smoking
those black offensive ropes that the french supply
corps called cigars blowing rings and watching
them as they ascended into the breeze where they
were torn to shreds i dreamed of home and peace
once while in such a mood a dragon-fly darted
across the road and poised for a moment above the
exact center of a smoke ring then was the idea
born the dragon-fly was an airplane and the smoke-
ring was some gaseous yet substantial material it
would be a simple matter to bring down enemy planes
then such at least was the suggestion the ring
in rising would be sure to spread over a vast area
and cause considerable disturbance in the air about it

  that idea came to my mind many times after i
had returned to the states i made mental plans
about the completion of the machine i studied the
operation of the human mouth and throat while form-
ing rings when the plans were finally developed to
the point where i believed it warranted an actual ex-
periment i went to ava ohio where i thought i
would be able to experiment without interference or
danger why i should have selected ava of all
places i will never know

  i rented a huge three-story barn three miles from
the nearest farmhouse and began to gather my
machinery for turning out smoke rings my early
experiments were successful in a way i made a few
rings hundreds of feet thick and a mile or more in
diameter but they were of gas and lacked solidity-
a very necessary requirement i remember the furore
that was created in ava the night i sent up a ring
composed of explosive gases the ring shot to a
height of two miles spreading out to a diameter of
five miles and there ignited the explosion lit up the
whole country-side always for the sake of safety

and secrecy i carried these experiments on at night
also i was not at all sure as to how the world at
large would accept the idea of a man secluding him-
self in the country for the mere purpose of making
smoke rings

  then came real development i spent many weeks
digging and walling a shaft thirty feet deep into the
hard ground and rising twenty feet above the roof
of the barn this shaft was the exact center of the
ring apparatus in the early hours of september d
i made the finishing touches anxious to see my
latest scheme at work i determined to give it a trial
test then as i scanned the heavy leaden night
heavens i noticed that a storm was approaching from
the north now and then the moon broke through
the hurrying clouds lighting up the dark landscape
in weird patches of light and shadow over the dis-
tant town of ava the lightning flashed and rumbled
the air was chill and i felt a vague oppressive weight
descending upon me however i shook it off and
turned my mind to the work on hand

  great i thought if all is to the good ill bore
a hole a mile in diameter through those clouds over-
head running to the switchboard i threw in the
switches controlling the many air pumps and for
almost an hour the pumps kept up their maddening
thump chug thump chug as they filled the gigantic
tanks

  then the valves were opened letting the hot moist
ring-gases fill the central well going up to the roof
to see if the clouds were dense enough i made sure
that the well cover was tightly closed reassured i
opened the compressed air tanks thereby admitting
compressed air into the well and placing the ring-
gases under tremendous pressure the air was the
initial propellent i waited a few minutes and then
i pulled the release cord a low hiss arose as the
gases escaped from the well and there rose into the
air the most perfect ring i had ever made so black
and opaque that it was more like a ring of steel than
a flimsy gas ring swiftly and silently it rushed up-
wards growing larger and larger

  and then i saw something that froze the blood in
my veins high above the rising ring was the long
slender shape of a zeppelin outlined in the break of
the clouds the moon shone on her sides for an in-
stant then all was black even the ring was lost to my
sight

  lightning flashed close by and rain began to patter
on the roof i stood as in a trance in a horrible
nightmare hoping and hoping against hope that my
engine of destruction was a failure i stood there i
know not how long it might have been centuries
before i was awakened from my stupor by the heart-
rending crash of a metal body meeting the unyielding
earth

  i found myself dashing across the fields through
groves of trees slipping in muddy ditches as i made
my way in the direction of the crash i came upon
the scene and stopped overcome by horror slowly
the realization of what i had done gripped me i had
done it i you murderer screamed the crushed
and torn framework of what had once been the pride
of america the ghastly severed girders stretched
their long pointed fingers accusingly at me i stood
for hours brooding over the ruins the milling
crowd which quickly gathered darted here and there
in a sort of a daze excited and horrified by what they
saw
smoke

  on my way back to the accursed barn i came upon
a group of men removing an engine from a half-
buried gondola the souvenir collectors were even
then at work

  that was months years ago i dared not tell that
i had sent the shenandoah to her death no i would
have been thrown into some asylum i kept my
silence and awaited with sad forebodings the result
of my terrible act yet was i to blame i see the

rings	

set-back i have caused aeronautics the world thinks
the shenandoah was not strong enough to withstand
the attacks of the elements i know better there is
not an airship built and never will be that will with-
stand the terrific concussion of a smoke ring air-
planes too become unmanageable in the clutch of
the ring

  it was a gas ring that destroyed the shenandoah
not the storm

doubt at his heart presently the doubt was irresist-
ible he got out of bed slowly shivering and ad-
vanced to the jar with his hand raised surely he
would see now his imagination had deceived him
recognize the distinctive sheen of bronze at last
after an age of hesitation his fingers came down on
the patterned cheek of the head he withdrew them
spasmodically the last stage was reached his
sense of touch had betrayed him

  trembling stumbling against the bed kicking
against his shoes with his bare feet a dark con-
fusion eddying round him he groped his way to
the dressing-table took his razor from the drawer
and sat down on the bed with this in his hand in
the looking-glass he saw his own face colorless
haggard full of the ultimate bitterness of despair

  he beheld in swift succession the incidents in the

the

 brief tale of his experience his wretched home his
 still more wretched school days the years of vicious
 life he had led since then one act of selfish dishonor
 leading to another it was all clear and pitiless now
 all its squalid folly in the cold light of the dawn he
 came to the hut to the fight with the porroh man
 to the retreat down the river to sulyma to the
 mendi assassin and his red parcel to his frantic
 endeavors to destroy the head to the growth of his
 hallucination it was a hallucination he knew it
 was a hallucination merely for a moment he
 snatched at hope he looked away from the glass
 and on the bracket the inverted head grinned and
 grimaced at him    with the stiff fingers of his
 bandaged hand he felt at his neck for the throb of
 his arteries the morning was very cold the steel
 blade felt like ice

the most exhaustive criticism of our work from an appreciative reader

editor amazing stories

  dear sir it strikes me as interesting from a
psychological standpoint for so many of the readers
of amazing stories to peruse each issue carefully
then to write to you and criticize the stories be-
cause they are very imaginative and improbable
these are the qualities that do much to interest me
in the stories the readers criticize certain points of
certain stories as being impossible because it is
against the law of gravitation or for some similar
reason what do they read the magazine for it
is fiction and fiction can be as wild as possible
neither is it necessary that it be possible for a story
to happen-impossible themes are very interesting

   i will be well satisfied if you continue the maga
zine as it is now in almost every respect you
have a fine balance of serials complete stories new
ones and reprints the covers and illustrations arc
fine and very interesting your comments on the
stories and the discussions column are satis-
factory in my opinion the magazine shows long
seasoned judgment in its arrangement also your
very friendly attitude in your comments on the vari-
ous stories inspires confidence and creates friend-
ship in particular i am pleased with your policy
of labeling all continued stories as such with the
number of installments so many magazines start
a story and the reader does not know if it will
continue for two issues or twenty-two i read all
the continued stories but never until t have the
issues containing all the installments unless by
mistake

  i seem to be naturally interested in science
when barely in my teens i took up the study of
astronomy and observing and absolutely unaided
except by books i located all the constellations of
the xorthern hemisphere so that i might say i
could call the stars by name i went into the
subject thoroughly and deeply then about a
decade ago while in the navy i was at the naval
observatory at mare island for about a year all
told carrying on the scientific work there such as
transi observations time reduction chronometer
comparison and observation for my own interest
through the five-inch telescope they had built in
 by alvan clark for the observation of the
transit of venus while at the naval observatory
i had the privilege of being secretary to captain
t t j see in charge and i found him to be one
of the most honorable and high idealed men i have
ever known with a beautiful character and scion
tific ability which will rank with the greatest of all
lime in the past few years i have entered other
lines but still have a great interest in science
note t might remark that the naval observatory
at mare island california is primarily a time sta-
tion doing chronometer comparison for the navy
and sending out time signals and is not a regular
stellar observatory neither the telescope nor sur-
roundings being suitable in addition to the above
i was lucky enough to go below the equator where
t could observe and learn most of the southern
constellations

  the above paragranh is rather detailed but i
give it to show that i have the background to ap-
preciate good scientific stories when i see them t
have read amazing storirs from the beginning
and have every issue it is quite a satisfaction for
me to write this letter now not that i wish or
expect to influence the policy of your magazine
which i do not wish to change but because it is

a pleasure to recall the stories read in it and how
they affected me

   starting with the very first issued april 

i was glad to get in a convenient form the jules
verne story off on a comet verne is not quite
so easy for me to read as when i first perused his
stories and some years ago i read practically every
one that was available in this country but it is a
great satisfaction to have many of his works on
hand and i am apt to go back and reread them at
any time

  in the man from the atom and the thing
from-outside you  have stories of superlative
merit the latter one is suggestive of algernon
blackwoods the willows which is a type of
story i like perhaps better than any other kind or
almost as much as any other kind at least

  the story the man who saved the earth
did not appeal to me and it was about the last one
i would have picked for re-publication in the fivsl
annual not so much was it the plot as the
technique i think one might say too much work
ing of providence and fate and even the begin
ning and broken sentences hpvvever i will re
read it sometime and probably like it better

  when reading amazing stories i mark the
-lories when i finish them using marks to show
how much i liked them for instance the figure
 means the story is good enough to merit my
attention  is good  is very good  is
excellent and  is the highest degree then
later on t can tell what stories i wish to read
the man from the atom and the thing from
-outside are of the fifth degree

  in regard to poe and wells-more later

  in may -the man from the atom a
sequel to the one in the previous issue is also of
the fifth degree the crystal egg with the
fine cover illustration was noticeable but seemed
to consist in somebody looking into a crystaj and
seeing a martian landscape which was weird
enough but nothing happened and it was very weak
as to plot the infinite vision seemed rather
purposeless also

  in june -the coming of the tee is of
the fourth degree next to the best whispering
ether was an interesting story the runaway
skyscraper was of the fifth degree and t only
wish it were longer mr fosdick and an ex-
periment in gyro-tiats and similar stories fur
nish a kind of comic relief which i will read but
a humorous scientific story or ghost story seems to
he rather anomalous personally i am not attracted
by them though many others like them the
malignant entity is of the fifth degree though t
had read it previously the criticism of the comic
relief stories does not apply to dr hackensaws
secrets-they are so full of ideas that i consider
them to be very valuable

  july -station x is of the fifth degree
and shows great thought and ability the moon
metal was very interesting as was the mag-
netic storm both of which are of the third or
fourth derrrees i thought the eggs from lake
tanganyika was interesting but not particularly
noteworthy

  as for wells-t wish to cover all his stories
in the latter part of this letter

  august -columbus of space is good
but there seems to be a kind of drag in most inter-
planetarian stories-the formula being almost al-

ways about the same-consisting of a woifd cylin-
der near death from bombarding meteors etc in
the talking brain we have a story of the fourth
degree all these graded in my estimation of
course which was horrible and attractive con-
tinue publishing horrible stories once in awhile
they cant be worse than much of actual life
high tension was also noteworthy jules verne
is always worthwhile referring to all of his stories
you publish including doctor oxs experiment
in this issue but i do agree that his style is rather
mid-victorian and comparatively hard to read in
this present age but so are scott thackeray and
dickens i really believe the fault is with us and
our environment rather than with these authors

  september  did not stand out so much as
the previous volumes or issues of amazing stories
other than that it had a continuation of sta-
tion x

  octoker -hurrah for beyond the pole
it merits the fifth degree the story was interest-
ing and thoughtful and full of ideas and i was
pleased very much pleased to find that the lobster
like creatures were kind and good and it was
pathetic the way they were destroyed blasphemers
plateau was second degree

  november -one of the most fascinating
and interesting stories published to this date oc-
tober  in amazing stories is the second
deluge by garrett p serviss the psychology
was perfect and true to life just as in the days
of noah they ridiculed and refused to believe so
it is in this story and the flood came the
mad planet is worth a second reading at least

  december -the time eliminator was
delightful and i wish it had been longer through
the craters rim ranked high also the diamond
tens was a worthy reprint

  january -the man who could vanish
was fine as far as it went but could easily be de-
veloped into novel length it was of the fifth de-
gree the red dust as well as the story before
it the mad planet was good

  february -on the martian way was
an excellent story and rather sad the land that
time forgot was fine as is practically all bur-
roughs work i noted particularly the thought
machine which is singularly unusual and fasci-
nating

  march -the hammering man failed to
arouse much interest being obviously a 
socialist story green splotches is well worth
re-rcadiug

  aprtl  -tn the plague of the living
dead we have one of the most fascinating stories
ever published in amazing stories and one de-
liciously horrible

  may -t started the moon pool once at
bed time and did not make much headway in it
after reading two installments however it is a
fine thoughtful story and rather deep and some-
time this winter i hone to start it over again and
read it complete tnis whole iseue of amazing
stories was good

  june -was glad to get the first set of
prize stories your choice was good referring to
the first three though i think the honorable men-
tion stories were about as good and easier to read
again a hyatt verrills the voice from the
inner world was probably the most interesting of
the bunch though some of the others required more

 thought the four-dimensional rollcr-press was

 july -radio mates was interesting but
 rather obvious

  august -the tissue-culture king was
 excellent reminding one of the island of dr
 moreau by wells the retreat to mars
 sounded as though wells might have written it
 though this though is deliberate it is interest-
 ing the chemical magnet stands high and
 gives an excellent new idea again a hyatt ver-
 rill kept up to his high standard in the ultra-

  september -the stone cat was very
 obvious but very interesting the radio ghost
 was excellent as is most of klines work

   how anyone can criticize unfavorably the colour
 out of space by ii p lovecraft is beyond me

 it is of that superbly fascinating type of stories
 like the willows by blackwood and the thing
 front-outside ft easily ranks as one of the best
 ten stories ever published in amazing stories and
 is well nigh perfect both as to plot technique and
 ending now if h g wells could make any-
 thing as worthwhile as the colour out of space
 he would have something to brag about

  the  annual-i hope that the next annual
 you publish contains only new stories-i mean
 those not already published in amazing stories
 and i wish it came twice a year the master
 mind of mars is as good as any burroughs story
 and i think it is better than the land that time
 forgot i agree with a letter in november 
 discussion column that merritt might combine the
 face in the abyss and the moon pool into
 another story a sequel to both and possibly com-

 bine the people of the pit with them the
 are all magnificently well done

  october -around the universe was
good though i am rather against stories that are
lilled with too much slang and poor language re-
ferring of course to tubby who was rather il-
literate if the characters are illiterate do not let
them talk too much however this story was very
satisfying the winged doom had one par-
ticularly noteworthy idea-the destruction of the
airplanes by exhausting the air pressure around them
for an instant thus making them fall and causing
their annihilation when striking the air again 
have not read treasures of tantalus yet but it
promises to be good

   i have just read the astounding discoveries of
 doctor mentiroso in the november  issue

 i will have to re-read it and meditate carefully upon
 it however after a first reading i might call at-
 tention to the fact that in spanish fcnomeno
 mentiroso means phenomenal liar and the
 esnesnon substance is nonsense spelled back-
 wards and that dr liar is a big spoofer further-
 more that the story is rather a rons asinorttm
 and that dr liar seemed not so much to be a

phd as a d--ph--- he seemed to be

 reasoning from faulty premises something upon
 the order of the fallacious syllogism

   nothing is better than wisdom

    dry bread is better than nothing

    therefore dry bread is better than wisdom

   now for mr herbert george wells

   in wells opinion all the rest of us arc rotten
 and many of us share the same opinion regarding
 ii g wells you just know his characters as a
 rule have halitosis and bromidrosis they are as
 a rule unnecessarily mean and snobbish ilis
 stories instead of having the fire of enthusiasm
 such as we find in those of verill are slow
 and plodding and plain british stodgy ite did
 reach a high level in the time machine with its
 gentle little characters of the far distant future
 the island of dr moreau was very interesting
 the first men in the moon was interesting
 but the war of the worlds-the great mystery
 to me is how he could establish a reputation upon
 such a story rather plotless and filled full of
 dumpy sloppy descriptions which drag terribly
 they are so painfully put together that he gives
 one the impression that he was forcing himself to
 write and just to fill space most of his stories
 have fine plots but the technique of wells is irri-
 tating to me without the ability of character de-
 lineation of scott or dickens he yet writes in the
 nineteenth century tiresome style i think lie has
 us buffaloed or he thinks he has but i for one
 see through herbert george wells if i read the
 war of the worlds right it seems that accounts
 filtered out from the vicinity of where the martians
 first used their death ray telling of great death
 and destruction but none of the population of the
 other places was interested at all

    i like fngland and the british nation and though
 they may be rather dull at times they are not as
 dopey as wells makes them out to be in their
 handling of the martian invasion furthermore
 what were the other notions of the earth doing
 while great britain was undergoing this trouble
 wells blithefully ignores this most important part
 of such a situation

    however i carefully read most of the stuff by
 wells you publish and am glad to have it but
 he certainly does not rank as high as many of the
 other authors whose works you publish

    i think that a hyatt verrill is as good as
 any author in amazing stories of whose stories
 you have published several h p lovecraft
 about his equal and g peyton wertenbaker is fine
 the man from the atom

    following are what i think are the best stories

   to us as editors this letter is most ini
 our innate modesty is such that it impresses
 flattering but our kindly critic puts a good ele-
 ment of spice into what he writes and what he
 says about wells this author may be stodgy and
 british in his ways as a writer and his work may
 be in the nineteenth century style but you must
 remember that wells and much of his work cer-
 tainly belongs to the twentieth century for what
 he writes is tinged with an aspect of certainty
 which affects far too much the work of many au-
 thors of the present day the fact that wells is a
 prolific author and has so much public appreciation
 can only mean one thing and that is that the pub-
 lic likes him the object of amazing stories of
 course is to please as many readers as possible
 and wells certainly seems to have the knack of
 pleasing a large circle of admirers

   your account of your work at the island observa-
 tory is interesting calling to mind the famous
 alvan clark from whose shop in cambridge some
 of the worlds finest lenses for astronomical work
 were turned out in one of your sentences you
 say in regard to poe and wells-more later
 but you dont tell us any more about poe we
 certainly would be very slow to put wells on a
 par with scott or dickens but he is individualistic
 enough to be exempt from such a comparison

 twe note what you say about dr mentiroso we
 did not give the origin of esnesnon as we wished
 to leave it to our readers to puzzle out it is in
 line with the country of erehwon in samuel
 butlers famous novel which you will observe is
 nowhere spelled backwards we certainly accept
 your conclusion that the doctor deserved this name
 but perhaps are too charitable to wish to give him

the degree you assign him of d- ph-

what a reader of the fair sex
thinks of h g wells

 editor amazing stories

  after reading the discussion column in your
 november number i feel that i must either write
 this letter or burst

   do you only print letters that abuse mr wells
 i have been under the impression that he is to be
 classed with shakespeare and dumas and dickens
 why every time i read one of the letters that
 endeavor to criticize mr wells works i experi-
 ence a chilling shock

   the first time i had ever heard of this amazing
 stories magazine was when my favorites were not
 in stock i looked around for something else that
 was not too sickening and glancing through one
 of the copies of amazing stories i saw the war
 of the worlds of course i had already read this
 story at least two times but one does not snub
 a friend because he has seen him before and i
 joyfully added your magazine to my very small
 collection of monthlies

  i have looked forward to reading amazing
 stories and will be glad to buy it as a semi-
 monthly or even weekly magazine

mrs e grunt

jersey city n j

   we agree with you we are glad to find that
 mr wells has a champion in the fair sex we
 are delighted to see that you have read and re-read
 the war of the worlds the story which has
 excited some unfavorable criticism and to our
 mind unjust criticism from some of our readers
 there are several things which it takes a skillful
 writer to get into a story one of these is con-
 versation between the characters another is detail
 enough to give it life and another is to skillfully
 use local color we do not think that mr wells
 work is lacking in any one of these qualities -

the end of the hero in many stories
the war of the worlds

editor amazing stories

   i have just finished the november issue of your
magazine and have some criticisms to make in
the machine man of ardathia the author has had
the character go insane perhaps this is making it
go a little too harsh but in many of your stones
the hero either goes insane is killed or else dis-
appears and is not seen thereafter this is es-
  true if the main character is an inventor
the lord of the winds the dis-
iuof doctor mentiroso the columbus of
space and many others in most of such stories
this unhappy even absolutely prevents a sequel
being written to the story in the abyss is
another instance to a story like- the moon
tool a sequel might easily be written and by
the way i regard the latter story as the best that
has ever been published in amazing stories

  however  am wandering from my subject i
wish to compliment you on the way you are making
your magazine thinner

   when  first saw your november issue  thought
that it did not contain as many pages as before
but investigation disclosed that there were as many
pages as in any of the previous numbers i ap-
preciate tlin thinner paper as i am having my
magazines hound and the compactness will be
an advantage i regard a merritt as the best
author that you have with h g wells as the
next my main objection to the latter author is
that he draws out his stories too much in the
war of the worlds he sure has a rotten army
of course no army could stand long against the
heat-kay but they surely should have given a
better account of themselves than they did give
they could have put on gas-masks to protect them-
selves from the black smoke they could probably
have exterminated the martians if their guns were
any good at all and if not could have sent up
dirigibles or airplanes with bombs then too
the martians would probably be no more immune
from poisonous gas than the earthlings and the
defensive army could have sent out poison gas
on their own account

   but aside from minor faults like this the story
was excellent and proved interesting reading

   in fiction you will find it very usual to end a
story with the dath of the hero another usual
ending is a happy love affair but amazing
storie is not addicted to love stories as they do
not usually harmonize with scientific themes con-
cerning the war of the worlds that very in-
teresting story was written before the days of ef-
fective dirigibles before there were any airplanes
and before anybody ever heard of poison gas as
used in warfare you give  wells a very high
place in spite of your criticism of the -w ar ot
the worlds amazing stories has been made
tiiinner-which implies the use of thinner paper
but absolutely no reduction in the number of pages
about eight months ago we substituted a better
paper which reduced the thickness of the magazine

some 

   recently through a mistake of the paper mill a
carload of paper that was not intended for this
publication was sent to and used by our printer
which accounts for the fact that some ot our
readers received thin copies you will find that
the present issue is up to the standard again

editor amazing stories

  the other day a very learned friend of mine
came upon me reading the last issue of the amaz-
ing stories he wanted to know why i read such
trash and why i did not read something worth

  my duty was plain i first told him if such
men as edgar a poe and h g wells wrote
trash i had yet to know it i then asked him if
he would not like to live to see all the things the
future will bring out he said yes  i then told
him that is why x read such trash you do not
live the mere sum of  to  years but from 
to  years i am sure that almost no inven-
tion could surprise me now it would seem very
familiar to me i have gotten out of the rut i
gave him my friend an issue of amazing stories
and sent him off i was not surprised when lie
came to me today and wanted to know if t had
any older issues he was always kidding me but
then i had him he was convinced i have never
missed an issue from the start in april  and
i dont intend to

  we are glad you convinced your friend we
are basing our work on the idea that a highly in-
telligent and appreciative audience can be reached
and we are sparing no effort to do so some like
one story better than another some will absolutely
dislike some of the stories all this is to be ex-
pected and is unavoidable but your account of
converting your friend is certainly very graphic
and amusing and we appreciate what you ve done

chemistry

 from beginning to end

simple
non-technical

  mr floyd l darrow the author has
  succeeded in bringing a heretofore ob-
  scure and reproachful subject chemistry
  to the eyes of the layman in a most un-
  derstandable and comprehensive style

  just lacking the forbidding mathematical
  expressions equations and chemical for-
  mulae this book presents an education in
  chemistry that would require several
  years of college training

  the most moderp research and the high-
  est authorities known in chemical investi-
  gation combined to make this book with
  its interesting knowledge possible to the
  layman

  there are things in chemistry that you should
  know-things that a really well educated per-
  son does know and this book besides afford-
  ing you pleasant reading gives you that
  knowledge it leads you from the abyss of
  the medieval alchemist to the present days of
  modern chemistry and its bearing on every
  day life-and holds your interest

  the book is sturdily bound x inches with
  an abundance of instructive illustrations it
  will be a beautiful addition to your library

another view of h g wells

 editor amazing stories

   as this is my second letter to you i will not
 consume space complimenting you on your publica-
 tion that it fills my hours of relaxation and stimu-
 lates my imagination to the nth degree is sufficient

   the november issue of amazing stories was
 once again examined critically one author in par-
 ticular appears to be the target of censure that
 is poor abused mr wells some of the self-
 appointed critics do not have the common decency
 to adhere to the regulations of convention in their
 fervor of derision but resort to the vocabulary of
 the pugnacious illiterates to express their vehe-
 mence however this is mental vis inertiae and
 can only be adjusted during the course of evolution
 regarding mr wells case let us hope lie success-
 fully repels these incidental onslaughts and does
 not deviate to the level of his disparagers imagina-
 tions

   for the sake of argument let us take a few
 of the points criticized the war of the worlds
 was the great bone of contention in the first place
 length of description is a matter of opinion charles
 dickens was a past master in the art of diffusive
 definitions still his works are considered classics
 by the intelligentsia if a reader demands his lit-
 erature in abbreviated form there arc books of
 this quality in every librarians establishment a
 lighter and more violent form of fiction should
 satiate this uncontrollable passion which looks for
 action in every line

    the request that his stories be eliminated is not
 only extremely egotistic but ludicrous as well
 pardon my cynical attitude but its laughable to
 hear a person of little or no literary standing tear-
 ing a recognized genius in his particular line to
 shreds with no fundamental data to base his
 criticism on the countless others who are enter-
 tained by the despised tales are given no considera-
 tion the ever-present sense of overindulged ego
 demands that the displeasing sections be abolished
 such a specimen has the consummate presumption to
 say vanity thy name is woman  have always
 believed that egotism was the fundamental basis of
 existence but  detest seeing the veneer of culture
 being so rudely thrust aside and the egotistic ele-
 ment so forcibly applied

   dont labor under the impression that i am h g
 wells champion he is one of my favorite authors
 but my scope of literature has been wide and
 varied his remarkable imagination his phrase-
 ology and his technique in description are the un-
 derlying factors that bring me to his defence i am
 well aware of the fact that it is unnecessary to de-
 fend him but i derive a certain amount of pleas-
 ure during the procedure

   another of your correspondents waxes philosophic
 and defines the intrinsic impossibility philosophy
 and intrinsic do not combine intrinsic is defined
 as real true and in this particular case is con-
 verted into the absolute or absolute state of im-
 possibility since philosophy fails to admit the abso-
 lute state of anything the intrinsic impossibility
 must revert to the practical in a relative state it
 thus becomes a minor truth influenced by the major
 or philosophic truth which disproves the absolute
 and renders the practical impossibility unstable a
 practical impossibility may exist in a relative sense
 but an intrinsic or absolute philosophic state of
 impossibility never i have  been a follower of
 herbert spencer for years and sincerely trust i
 have done his teachings credit

   many thanks again for the enjoyable hours of
 reading you give me and my best wishes for the
 perpetuation of your success

   we are glad to see some of our correspondents
 come to the defence of mr wells although it would
 seem that so popular a writer one of the most read
 of the present day needs no defender the idea of
 eliminating his stories we find is very promptly
 condemned by this writer he is a favorite author
 of not only our correspondent but of an enormous
 cutele so here we have the war of the
 worlds commented on and criticized by a follower
 of herbert spencer and we are glad to find the
 subject so well treated-editor

   your excellent magazine is the first last and

   first let us take mr wells the main anti-
 wellsian in the november issue is vour flag-
 staff correspondent firstly in the war of the
 worlds his scorned exodus of the people is
 literature what more living or graphic picture
 of an utterly demoralized and panic-stricken nation
 entirely overwhelmed by fear of the unknown could
 any man want no wonder the gunners couldnt
 hit their targets they were practically self-
 hypnotized with their awe and horror and what is
 more i do not believe americans could have done
 any better incidentally i should like to bring to
 the attention of mr s kaufman another fault-
 finder that an airplane outlined against the sky
 is much more easily seen and brought down by
 such a weapon as the heat-rav than by entrenched
 artillery as to ihe spheres mr wells did most
 specifically mention that they were immediately

  amazing stories

guarded by martians as soon as they landed mr
riordan cannot have read his amazing stories
very carefully

  well so much for h g wells although much
more can be said for him probably every one
doesnt like him our tastes are not all alike but
we can at least give others credit for having some
taste as to your other authors mr merritt is so
far ray firm favorite he is great the way he
can make words live is a marvel this is the
quality that made poe and i notice that serviss
verrill verne wells and to a certain extent
burroughs all have it the latter is a good writer
and he certainly has a good imagination but there
is a good deal of sameness to some of his books
ralph milne farley who had three stories of
venus the radio man the radio beasts
and the radio planet in one of the munsey
publications has better science in the last for
instance the earth-born hero is forced to construct
a radio apparatus entirely from the material that is
found in nature there is also a race or rather
several races of intelligent insects which contest
the supremacy of the more human inhabitants i
should surely like to see these in amazing stories
as well as some of conan doyles scientific stories
his latest marascot deep is now running in the
saturday evening post

  as to science and invention re-prints by all
means have them but start from the beginning
we are not al old readers especially we younger
enthusiasts ray cummings has clone good work
in the past and many of us would like to know
how dr hackensaw started i for one had read
some six stories about him when they suddenly
stopped lets have him from secret no 
clean through to secret no last

  monthly or semi-monthly i really do not care
although i have a leaning in favor of the monthly
but please dont change until the beginning of a
new volume otherwise it would wreck the index
that i am compiling as for the annual you
might make it both annual and semi-annual for
instance a long novel once a year or perhaps two
and say one old and one new story by favorite
authors twice a year i think that it would work

  there is a good deal left to say but i wont
usurp all the space granted to us readers so ill
let it go for someone else to say at any rate

  although we do not feel that mr wells needs
any defense because he is well able to take care
of himself we are glad to find our views of the
war of the worlds confirmed by numbers of our
readers detail if skillfully applied as mr wells
undoubtedly applies it adds greatly to the vrai-
setnblance of a story dickens and thackeray are
good examples and it is not too much to say that
if we go back to the days of old times even homer
in his epics uses detail with great effect wells
story of the war of the worlds and his other
stories were the detail omitted would lose im-
mensely we feel that mr merritt in the
moon pool certainly produced a very striking
piecc of work and to anybody who has been in-
terested in the irish celts his depiction of the
character of the irishman the mixture of tem-
perament spirituality and practical everyday men-
tality is quite skillful-editor

suggestions for reprints
h g wells upheld

editor amazing stories

  i have read your magazine amazing stories
with considerable interest from about the fourth
or fifth issue i have always taken an interest
in  science and scientific fiction and have greatly
enjoyed many of the stories which have appeared
m this magazine

  i think your policy of reprinting stories by
jules verne ii g wells etc is a very good
one and it is very interesting to read them again
after many years in this connection i would
like to ask if you could reprint some of the stories
by george griffiths of which a honeymoon in
space is one of the best known i think this
story is out of print now and i am sure that if
it was reprinted as a serial in your magazine it
would be much appreciated as far as i remem-
ber the story was to some extent divided into
episodes one of which could appear each month
this author has written several very good yarns
on scientific lines though i cannot now remember
the names and t for one would very much like
to read them again

  i would  like however to join issue with you
on the subject of reprinting stories which have just
come out in book form i bought a copy of the
land that time forgot shortly  before it came
out iii your magazine and as the instalments were
long and took up a considerable amount of space
i felt that i was being done out of a good deal
of reading matter each month unless you can
print a story before it comes out in book form
i am sure it is a mistake to put it in a magazine
of course this is quite a different matter from
reprinting old stories by well-known authors

  the above brings me naturally to commenting
on the letters from a m riordan and s kauf-
man which appear in your november issue neither
of them appear to have grasped the fact that the
war of the worlds was written in s ie
practically thirty years ago when weapons of war
had not-by a very long way-reached their present

 about reprints we find that there is a special
 interest in such because much good work escapes
 only too many readers who may not see the par-
 ticular magazine in which it was given and it is

reckoning of time

  editor amazin stories

     have just finished reading a very excellent and
  highly interesting discussion on the mysteries of
  time supposed to be an accurate exposition ol the
  astounding discoveries of that distinguished and
  eminently great scientist doctor mentiroso

    far be it from me to criticise the work of so
  great and eminent a scientist as the learned doctor
  yet lest some of the great mass of the unscientific
  public who will read of these discoveries may
  misconstrue some of his statements and be led into
  the bypaths of unscientific speculation i feel that
  it is my duty to expound on some of his statements
  and perhaps criticise some

    far be it from me to offend the learned doctor
  but i feel that in some cases he has let his imagina-
  tion take flight and lias not confined himself to
  hard facts and sound reasoning and that some of
  his statements were actually unverified by
  experiments

    first let me say that i heartily agree with the
  eminent doctor and his illustrious contemporary
  kinstein that time like motion is purely a relative
  proposition to which fact i would like to add that
  size and shape are also purely relative

    likewise i heartily agree that it is possible to
  look into the past and witness events which hap-
  pened thousands or even millions of years ago
  likewise  just as emphatically declare that it is
  absolutely impossible to look into the future pro-
  vided that we do not juggle the time unit but
  confine ourselves to true time

    in farther presenting my reasons for these state-
  ments it will be necessary for me to divide my
  discussion into two parts that pertaining to past
  events and that pertaining to future happenings

    a straight line is the shortest distance between
  two points and time may be said to be analogous to
  this straight line in that it is the shortest duration
  or space letveen two events called the conception
  and the perception in other words time may be
  said to be that which intervenes between a happen-
  ing and its perception by the human mind or be-
  tween any two or more happenings which did not
  take place at the same instant

    now in a strict sense of the word an instant of
  time would be the same throughout the entire
  universe an event happening in one part of the
  universe actually happens in the most diverse part of
  the universe at the same instant lerhaps it may
  not be perceived as happening until thousands of
  years later  lowever this discrepancy is not due
  to the happening but to the media by which the
  action is transmitted throughout all space

    unfortunately light rays are the only means we
  have of perceiving an action unless we take into
  consideration radio sound or electrical means iiut
  what would hold true for light would hold true for
  these also so we will confine our illustrations to
  light rays only

    light has a finite speed of approximately 
  miles a second far very far from instantaneous
  consequently an action taking place at a distant
  point would not be perceived by us at our point
  of observation until the light rays or vibrations
  set up by the action reached us

    if this action or happening was carried by media
  whose speed was instantaneous and we had instru-
  ments or senses to intercept it any action happening
  any place in space woujd be perceived at any
  other point in space at the actual instant it hap-
  pened instead of at a later time perhaps there
  are such media and w-e havent instruments or
  faculties to intercept and register them on our
  senses however be that as it may this peculiar
  discrepancy in the speed of light waves from the
  instantaneous makes it possible for us to look into
  the past now this perception might be accom-
  plished by two methods first by intercepting
  light waves from the particular point of action at
  any desired point in space by means of ether waves
  or rays which would make them visible to our
  senses of sight in which case the farther away
  from the point of action the rays are intercepted
  the farther into the past one would look and
  secondly by actually traveling in space at a speed
  greater than that at which the light rays from the

        fit of action were traveling in which case the
 ihcr away from the point of action one traveled
 farther into the past one would penetrate how-
 i this viewing of past events must necessarily be
 y a pictorial perception as it is evidently im-
 sible for the physical present to mingle with the
 -wysical past that is it would be impossible for
 a person living in the present to transmit his
 physical self into the past and live and act in the
 drama of life then being unfolded

        now let us see what are our chances of penetrating
      into the future our good friend doctor mentiroso
      seems to believe this to be possible and cited several
      instances where he had actually witnessed an event
      several hours before it was reported as happening
      in the opposite side of the world although the word
      was sent almost immediately over the press wires
      s alrdshould have been at the most only a few
      minutes late in arriving

       now here is where i must differ very radically
     from our learned doctor because from any angle
     which f can conceive of i cannot imagine man
     ever invading the future and witnessing future
     events before they happen any witnessing of
     future events such as claimed by our learned doc-
     tor would have to he done by a joggling of the
     time unit

        as we stated before any action or object creates
     a disturbance in a certain media such as light and
     this affects our senses of sight causing us to per-
     ceive the action or object the time intervening
     depending on the distance the light waves must
     travel consequently it is self-evident that unless
     we have the action or object to create the waves
     in the medium we could have no perception of it

      the mere fact that our learned doctor was
    able to perceive an event apparently twelve hours
    before it happened was due to the rather crude
    method which man has invented for telling the dura-
    tion of time on this planet he has adopted an ar-
    bitrary system based upon the suns position but
    unfortunately the sun docs not rise at the same
    period of time at all points on the earth there be-
    ing a difference of twelve hours from one point to
    a directly opposite point in other words the sun
    rises twelve hours later at a point directly opposite
    new york than it does at new york yet in reality
    it is the same instant of time every place on earth
    to make up for this discrepancy man has con-
    veniently set his time picces back to correspond
    to sun-time thus a person traveling instantane-
    ously around the earth from east to west and
    setting his watch to correspond to the prevailing
     time at any specified points would find on returning
    that he had lost a day and night or in other words
    his watch would be twenty-four hours slow

       now that is the condition our friend dr men-
     tiroso found and he set his watch according to the
     prevailing time in the places he visited conse-
     quently he arrived in his starting place according to
     his watch several hours before he started looking
     at it from this angle a news item may be pub-
     lished before it happened due to the difference
     in time between the two points and to the rapid
     means of communication while in th true sense
     of the word the event happened at just one instant
     of time and as such was registered in all parts of
     the universe at that instant

       now- such a condition as above stated should
     not exist in this enlightened age of rapid com-
     munication it seems to me that the same instant
     of time should be specified the same throughout the
     entire universe and that sun time should be made
     to correspond twelve noon should be twelve noon
     at every point even though the sun was on the op-
     posite side of the earth at the time perhaps
     future generations may make this correction and
     do away with the possibility of a news item ar-
     riving in one part of the world before it was sup-
     posed to have happened

       i hope now that i have succeeded in exposing
     the fallacy of the theories of doctor mentiroso of
     penetrating into the future in the true sense of
     the word let us always bear in mind in ex-
     pounding any other theories of future forecasting
     that it is always necessary to have the action or
     object before our senses or any medium for regis-
     tering it will perceive or carry it thus it is self
     evident that any future forecasts are an impossi-
     bility and can exist only in the imagination of
     clairvoyants and fiction writers

     we have received a good deal of unfavorable
     criticism of dr mentiroso comparatively few peo-
     ple however realize the surpassing importance of
     the difference of time at different latitudes which
     has taken countless ships in safety over the oceans
     of the world and here curiously enough we find
     that dr mcntirosos theories have elicited- an ex-
     tremely interesting letter w-ith the original sugges-
     tion about changing the nomenclature of time we
     see our worthy friend the lying phenomenon has
     given good servicc in eliciting this suggestion from
     you it seems to us however that the doctors
     critics have taken him far too seriously and should
     rather regard the humor of the whole thing than
     its correspondence with their own ideas-editor

  details write norton  temple court denvercolo

   i especially when the professor took the planets from
   their orbits if the story was carried into detail
   i and made longer so as to become a serial it
    would be much better all of cummings stories
   i ire not bad ones however for instance in the
   weird tales they published a serial explorers
   i into infinity by him which was wonderful jf
   you arc going to reprint some of his stories why
   not pick the good ones another thing is ii 
   wells lie is the worst writer that you have
   he always tries to paint the character too much
   and as it is he only spoils a good story his story
   the war of the worlds started all right hut its
   ending was terrible why because he makes the
   brothers chronicle too long lie takes a little plot
   that would ordinarily cover only a paragraph or
   two and makes it take up a couple of chapters
   there are only two more criticisms that i have
   and these are why print those beastly detective
   and humorous stories they have no right to be in
   your magazine they contain only a little scien-
   tifiction and that is superfluous

     now lets turn to something toward the good
  of your magazine your authors as a whole are
  very good among the best are a merritt edgar
  rice burroughs a hyatt yerrill garrett p
  serviss and your latest garret smith these au-
  thors all arc very good but a merritt certainly
  leads them all i am looking forward to the sequel
  to the face in the abyss with great interest
  why not have him write a sequel to the moon
  pool which was a real masterpiece i am sure
  the readers would accept this with gratitude

     i am greatly in favor of having a semi-monthly
  magazine it seems too long to wait a whole month
  for the next issue to appear

     p s--i have just bought your november issue
  and the machine man of ardathia was a
  corker

     lit is fair to say that in selecting stories the
   editor is somewhat influenced by the reputation of
   the author and we feel that our list of names is
   quite impressive ray cummings work is very
   much appreciated and you will find in our columns
   appreciation of detective stories you will observe
   that detective stories give an admirable basis for
   science especially physico-psychological apparatus
   and phenomena we hope that our authors may
   be inspired to carry out the sequels to their stories
   as proposed by many of our readers most of our
   readers liked the moon pool even if it was not
   editor c  lheme as some otlers have keen-

suggestions from a printer

 editor amazing stories

    the introduction of mr verrills story in the
  -november issue prompts me to write you and give
  my opinion of your magazine with suggestions
  which i think will be met favorably by your
  readers as well as by your authors

    since according to mr verrill no two seem to
  agree with comments as to stories etc perhaps
  many will agree about the appearance of your pub-
  lication you can glean from the heading of my
  letter that i am a printer while not a large com-
  mercial man nor one of vast experience in the
  game i have some ideas about the dress of printed
  matter

    i offer these suggestions and trust that no offense
  will be taken at the criticisms nor will they be
  misunderstood

    in the first place looking at the magazine from
  the inside out i find there are not many publica-
  tions which contain the material both from the
  standpoint of conversational english and from that
  of ideas which i find in your amazing stories
  i can hardly call it literature which  would like
  to do but it resembles it very much the authors
  have very good imaginations and have material
  which contains food for thought even for would-be
  scientists in which group i would be classed

    as i said looking at the book from the inside out
  t has merit which does not reflect from the outside
  m if you could and would get away from those
  heavy lithographed covers and use half-tones
  with a slight change in the style of the drawings
  it would have more appeal to the public i mean
  to more of the public then too if you would use
  a white book paper instead of the heavy newsprint
  you now use and command more advertisements to
  off-set the added expense it would create a larger
  circulation and then you would get a better class
  of advertisers and incidentally form amore or less
  endless chain between advertisers and circulation

    it can be done and i hope it will be done for
  i m very much interested in the success of the
  magazine and want it to continue i hope within
  tne next four months to submit a storv similar to
  garret smiths treasures of tantalus and vet it
  is different enough not to have the aspect of being
  copied or of being a take off

    a few more illustrations in the new magazine
 suggested would be beneficial providing that you
 can find other artists who can blend in with paul
 for that type of sketches

    i have been wondering whv some enterprising
 fellow doesnt locate an author in or near berlin or
  lenna and obtain some authentic fiction about the
 present trend of science take for instance the
 recent movie metropolis a german production
 universal film co supervision the most wonder-
 ful production i have ever witnessed the authors

     he play could give many interesting articles
 stories both authentic and imaginary for they
 nearer the home of sciences of various natures
 i we are here in america i mean they cao
 other subjects than just light rays death
 and other rays and fourth dimensions
 lie play i have reference to trusting that you
  not seen it deals with a topic and ideas
 similiar to these used for the day after to-
 morrow by sir phillip gibhs in the cosmopoli-
 tan in other words metropolis is the city of
 the future emphasizing the future living condi-
 tions buildings and the drudgery of future work
 fantastic thats true but quite probable and pos-
 sible and not as remote as some of the articles
 your magazine

   we think that you can safely call the stories
 we publish literature we certainly have dis-
 tinguished present-day authors your interest in
 the success of our magazine we assure you is most
 warmly appreciated and we should be very glad to
 read any stories which you might submit our
 artist paul has a particular talent which finds a
 very good field in the class of stories we print we
 have published in the past stories dealing with
 the city of the future some descriptions of which
 have been by no means lacking in originality and
 picturesqueness

   we fully agree with you that our covers are
 perhaps not artistic we are fully aware of that
 point but we are far more interested for selfish
 reasons and from your standpoint as well that for
 the success of amazing stories the magazine
 must first of all sell it has been known by ex-
 perience that only loud covers will stop the passerby
 at the news-stand these days all so-called artistic
 covers with few exceptions unless they are pretty
 girls heads do not make for large circulation

   as to the inside paper-it is true that the paper
 which we are using is not of the best but it would
 be economically impossible to publish this magazine
 at all right now with a better paper used as
 soon as the publication gets further along on its
 advertising road it will be possible to use much
 better paper kditok

a well thought out suggestion for
a story which will be amazing
yet true

 haitpr amazing stories

   being an ardent reader of amazing stories and
 one who haunts the news stands for each new copy
 on the fourth of every month i think i am entitled
 to my little say in regard to its contents

   although each copy is priceless to me and
 brings me great pleasure i find myself stumped
 when t try to interest my friends in its contents
 some think me crazy some just smile in a pitying
 way and others would like to be more convinced
 now all of your stories are very good i gather
 much valuable information from them all and your
 stories in general tend to satisfy a craving i have
 haa all my life for what lies beyond our own
 world but i am not only interested in myself 
 would like to interest my friends and i want you
 to help me

 all your stories with the exception of a few
 start with the present and wind up in the future

 i have read every issue that has been released and
 there isnt one story that does not make the reader
 stretch his or her imagination to some extent some
 stories seem almost impossible even to your imagi-
 nation while others make your brains reel trying
 to keep up with them

   now here is what i would like you to do sup-
 pose amazing stories were being published in the
 fourteenth century the authors of stories written
 at that time would naturally be persons with
 great foresight and gifted with ideas that might
 eome true hundreds of years later they would
 probably dream of great machines flying in the
 air people talking thousands of miles through the
 air etc and bring in many of our present day
 wonders which would all be very amazing to the
 people of the fourteenth century just as are our
 present day amazing stories of today to us the
 people of that day would never believe some of
 our present day facts nor will a lot of present
 lay people believe in what will be facts of the
 future

   i want you to get someone to write such a
 sample story that will show your present readers
 that amazing stories can come true and the only
 way to convince them is to presumably write it
 in the fourteenth century and show everyone that
 what would appear a mad dream hundreds of years
 ago is just a commonplace today  am sure such
 a story would convince the majority of my friends
 of what might happen in the future it would
 prove of great interest to your thousands of readers

wo today could feel how superior we arc in
intelligence to the people of that day and how
ignorant we may appear to the coming generations

 at least ask your readers what they think of
 this idea

 hoping you can do this and will publish this

 your suggestion for a story is so good that we
 ope some of our authors will act upon it it
 would be quite in the vein of one of edgar a
 ioes stories and should offer a fertile field what
 do our readers think-editor
