at the first symptom of a cold or sore throat-

listerineiquick

listerine antiseptic reaches way back on the
throat surfaces to kill secondary invaders 
   the very types of germs that make a cold
more troublesome

  this prompt and frequent use of full strength
listerine antiseptic may keep a cold from getting
serious or head it off entirely   at the same time
relieving throat irritation when due to a cold

  this is the experience of countless people and it
is backed up by some of the sanest most imoressive
research work ever attempted in connection with
cold prevention and relief

fewer colds tests showed

actual tests conducted on all types of people in

several industrial plants over
 years revealed this aston-
ishing truth that those who
gargled listerine antiseptic
twice daily had fewer colde
and milder colds than non-
users and fewer sore throats

  this impressive record is
explained by listerine anti-
septics germ-killing action
   its ability to kill threatening secondary invad-
ers - the very types of germs that breed in the
mouth and throat and are largely responsible many
authorities say for the bothersome aspects of a cold

germ reductions up to 

  even  minutes after listerine antiseptic gargle
tests have shown bacterial reductions on mouth and
throat surfaces ranging to  up to  an hour
afterward

   in view of this evidence dont you think its a sen-
sible precaution against colds to gargle with listerine
antiseptic systematically twice a day and oftener when
you feel a cold getting started

t b  youre that man heres something that will
        interest you

a jl not a magic formula-not a get-rich-quick
scheme-butsomethingmoresubstantial more practical

  of course you need something more than just the
desire to be an accountant youve got to pay the price
-be willing to study earnestly thoroughly

  still wouldnt it be worth your while to sacrifice some
of your leisure in favor of interesting home study-over
a comparatively brief period in your life always pro-
vided that the rewards were good-a salary of 
to 

  an accountants duties are interesting varied and of
real worth to his employers he has standing

  do you feel that such things arent for you well
dont be too sure very possibly they can be

  why not like so many before you investigate
lasalles modern problem method of training for an
accountancy position

  just suppose you were permitted to work in a large
accounting house under the personal supervision of an
expert accountant suppose with his aid you studied
accounting principles and solved problems day by day
-easy ones at first-then the more difficult ones if you
could do this-and if you could turn to him for advice
as the problems became complex-soon youd master
them all

  thats the training you follow in principle under the
lasalle problem method

  you cover accountancy from the basic principles
right up through accountancy systems and income tax
procedure then you add c p a training and pre-
pare for the c p a examinations

  as you go along you absorb the principles of audit-
ing cost accounting business law statistical con-
trol organization management and finance

  your progress is as speedy as you care to make it-
depending on your own eagerness to learn and the time
you spend in study

  will recognition come the only answer as you know
is that success does come to the man who is really
trained its possible your employers will notice your
improvement in a very few weeks or months indeed
many lasalle graduates have paid for their training-
with increased earnings-before they have completed it
for accountants who are trained in organization and
management are the executives of the future

the man who saved
              the earth

 by austin hall

he rushed alone and unafraid to the rim of eternity armed with a theory of
salvation which in unworried days would have made the shrewdest scientist laugh

 a complete novelet

the whole earth rocked to the recoil
as the gigantic machine on mt
robold loosed its mysterious force

copyright  by the frank a munsey company

chapter i

the beginning

even the beginning from the start
the whole thing has the precision of
machine work fate and its working-and
the wonderful providence which watches
over man and his future the whole thing
unerring the incident the work the ca-
lamity and the martyr in the retrospect
of disaster we may all of us grow strong
in wisdom let us go into history

a hot july day a sun of scant pity
and a staggering street panting thousands

dragging along hatless the sultry venge-
ance of a real day of summer a day of
hot pavements and wrecked endeavor
heartaches for the seashore for leafy
bowers beside rippling water a day of
broken hopes and listless ambition

  perhaps fate chose the day because of
its heat and because of its natural benefit
on fecundity we have no way of know-
ing but we do know this the date the
time the meeting the boy with the burn-
ing glass and the old doctor so common-
place so trivial and hidden in obscurity


who would have guessed it yet it is-
after the creation--one of the most im-
portant dates in the worlds history

  this is saying a whole lot let us go
into it and see what it amounts to let
us trace the thing out in history weigh
it up and balance it with sequence

 of charley huyck we know nothing
up to this day it is a thing which for
some reason he has always kept hidden
recent investigation as to his previous
life and antecedents have availed us noth-
ing perhaps he could have told but
as he has gone down as the worlds great

martyr there is no hope of gaining from
his lips what we would so like to know

  after all it does not matter we have
the day-the incident and its purport
and its climax of sequence to the day of
the great disaster also we have the blasted
mountains and the lake of blue water
which will ever live with his memory his
greatness is not of warfare nor personal
ambition but of all mankind the wreaths
that we bestow upon him have no doubtful
color the man who saved the earth

from such a beginning charley huyck
lean and frail of body with even then

the red light of terror shot straight up into space a thousand miles
and the four great wonderful globes held the life of the sun captive to
man for the few precious seconds that would spell the difference be-
tween life and everlasting oblivion


famous fantastic mysteries

the wistfulness of the idealist and the
eyes of a poet charley huyck the boy
crossing the hot pavement with his pack
of papers the much treasured piece of
glass in his pocket and the sun which only
he should master burning down upon him
a moment out of the ages the turning of
a straw destined to out-balance all the
previous accumulation of mans history

  the sun was hot and burning and the
child-he could not have been more than
ten-cast a glance over his shoulder it
was in the way of calculation in the hey-
day of childhood he was not dragged down
by the heat and weather he had the en-
thusiasm of his half-score of years and
the joy of the plaything we will not
presume to call it the spirit of the scientist
though it was perhaps the spark of latent
investigation that was destined to lead
so far

  a moment picked out of destiny a
boy and a plaything uncounted jnillions
of boys have played with glass and the
sun rays who cannot remember the little
round-burning dot in the palm of the hand
and the subsequent exclamation charley
huyck had found a new toy it was a
simple thing and as old as glass fate
will ever be so in her working

  and the doctor why should he have
been waiting if it was not destiny it
was at least an accumulation of moment
in the heavy eye-glasses the square close-
cut beard and his uncompromising fact-
seeking expression those who knew dr
robold are strong in the affirmation that
he was the antithesis of all emotion he
was the sternest product of science un-
bending hardened by experiment and caus-
tic toward the frailness of human nature

  it had been his one function to topple
over the castles of the foolish with his
hard-seeing wisdom he had spotted sophis-
try where we thought it not even into the
castles of science he had gone like a jug-
gernaut it is hard to have ones theories
derided-yea even for a scientist-and to
be called a fool dr robold knew no
middle language he was not relished by
science

his memory as we have it is that
of an eccentric a man of slight
compassion abrupt of manner and with
no tact in speaking genius is often so
it is a strange fact that many of the
greatest of men have been denied by their
fellows a great man and laughter he
was not accepted

  none of us know today what it cost
dr robold he was not the man to tell
us perhaps charley huyck might but
his lips are sealed forever we only know
that he retired to the mountain and of
the subsequent flood of benefits that rained
upon mankind and we still denied him
the great cynic on the mountain of the
secrets of the place we know little he
was not the man to accept the investiga-
tor he despised the curious he had been
laughed at-let be-he would work alone
on the great moment of the future

  in the light of the past we may well
bend knee to the doctor and his protege
charley huyck two men and destiny
what would we be without them one
shudders to think

  a little thing and yet one of the greatest
moments in the worlds history it must
have been fate why was it that this
stern man who hated all emotion should
so have unbended at this moment that
we cannot answer but we can conjecture
mayhap it is this we were all wrong
we accepted the mans exterior and pro-
fession as the fact of his marrow

  no man can lose all emotion the doctor
was after all even as ourselves-he was
human whatever may be said we have
the certainty of that moment and of
charley huyck

  the suns rays were hot they were
burning the pavements were intolerable
the baked air in the canoned- street was
dancing like that of an oven a day of
dog-days the boy crossing the street
his arms full of papers and the glass bulg-
ing in his little hip-pocket

  at the curb he stopped with such a
sun it was impossible to long forget his
plaything he drew it carefully out of
his pocket laid down a paper and began
the man who saved the earth



distancing his glass for the focus he did
not notice the man beside him why
should he the round dot the brownish
smoke the red spark and the flash of
flame he stamped upon it a moment
out of boyhood an experimental miracle
as old as the age of glass and just as
delightful the boy had spoiled the name
of a great governor of a great state but
the paper was still salable he had had
his moment mark that moment

  a hand touched his shoulder the lad
leaped up

  yessir star or bulletin

  ill take one of each said the man
there now i was just watching you
do you know what you were doing
yessir burning paper startin fire
thats the way the indians did it

  the man smiled at the perversion of
fact there is not such a distance between
sticks and glass in the age of childhood

  i know he said the indians but
do you know how it was done the why-
whv the paper began to blaze

  yessir

  all right explain

  the boy looked up at him he was a
city boy and used to the streets here
was some old high-brow challenging his
wisdom of course he knew

  its the sun

  there laughed the man of course
you said you knew but you dont why
doesnt the sun without the glass burn
the paper tell me that

  the boy was still looking up at him
he saw that the man was not like the
others on the street it may be that the
strange intimacy kindled into being at
that moment certainly it was a strange
unbending for the doctor

  it would if it was hot enough or you
could get enough of it together

  ah then that is what the glass is
for is it

  yessir

  concentration

  con-i dont know sir but its the
sun shes sure some hot i know a lot
about the sun sir ive studied it with

the glass the glass picks up all the rays
and puts them in one hole and thats what
burns the paper

  its lots of fun id like to have a bigger
one but its all ive got why do you
know if i had a glass big enough and
a place to stand id burn up the earth
the old man laughed why archime-
des i thought you were dead

  my name aint archimedes its charley
huyck

  oh is it well thats a good name
too and if you keep on youll make it as
famous as you did the other wherein
he was foretelling history where do you
live

  the boy was still looking ordinarily
he would not have told but he motioned
back with his thumb

  i dovt live i room over on brennan
street

  oh i see you room wheres your
mother

  search me i never saw her

  i see and your father

  how do i know he went floating
when i was four years old

  floating

  yessir-to sea

 so your mothers gone and your
fathers floating archimedes is adrift you
go to school

  yessir number twenty - six sixth
grade say its hot i cant stand here
all day ive got to sell my papers

  the man pulled out a purse

  ill take the lot he said then kindly
my boy i would like to have you go
with me

  it was a strange moment a little thing
with the fates looking on when destiny
plays she picks strange moments this
was one charley huyck went with dr
robold

chapter ii

the poison pall

we all of us remember that fatal
day when the news startled out of
oakland no one can forget it at first


famous fantastic mysteries

it read like a newspaper hoax in spite of
the oft-proclaimed veracity of the press
and we were inclined to laughter twixt
wonder at the story and its impossibility
we were not a little enthused at the nerve
of the man who put it over

  it was in the days when the world had
grown populous and of well-fed content
our soap-box artists had come to the point
at last where they preached not disaster
but a fullbellied thanks for the millennium
that was here a period of utopian quiet-
ness-no villain around the corner no
man to covet the ox of his neighbor

  those were the days of the millennium
nothing ever happened heres hoping
they never come again and then

  honestly we were not to blame for
bestowing blessing out of our hearts upon
that newspaperman even if it were a
hoax it was at least something

  at high noon a strange and a por-
tentous moment looking back and over
the miracle we may conjecture that it was
the clearness of the atmosphere and the
brightness of the sun that helped to the
impact of the disaster knowing what we
know now we can appreciate the impulse
of natural phenomena it was not a
miracle

  the spot fourteenth and broadway
oakland california

  fortunately the thousands of employees
in the stores about had not yet come out
for their luncheons the lapse that it takes
to put a hat on or to pat a curl saved
a thousand lives one shudders to think
of what would have happened had the spot
been crowded even so it was too im-
possible and too terrible to be true such
things could not happen

  at high noon the traffic policeman
at his post had just given his signal two
automobiles were passing and a single
pedestrian so it is said was working
his way diagonally across the corner of
this we are not certain

  one moment life and action an ordinary
scene of existent monotony and the next
moment nothing the spot the intersec-
tion of the street the two automobiles

pedestrian the policeman-non-existent
when events are instantaneous reports are
apt t be misleading this is what we
find

  some of those who beheld it report
a flash of bluish white light others that
it was of a greenish or even a violet hue
and others no doubt of stronger vision
that it was not only of a predominant
color but that it was shot and sparkled
vith a myriad specks of flame and burn-
ing

  it gave no warning and it made no
sound not even a whir like a hot breath
out of the void whatever the forces that
had focused they were destruction in
place of the intersection of the thorough-
fares was a yawning gulf that looked down
into the center of the earth to a depth of
nausea

  it was instantaneous it was without
sound no warning a tremendous force of
unlimited potentiality had been loosed to
kinetic violence it was the suddenness
and the silence that most belied credence
we were accustomed to associate all
disaster with confusion calamity has an
affinity with pandemonium all things of
terror climax into sound in this case there
was no sound hence the wonder

  a hole or bore forty feet in diameter
and the spectators one and all aver that
at first they took it fornothing more than
the effect of startled eyesight almost
subtle it was not until after a full minutes
reflection that they became aware that
a miracle had been wrought before their
faces then the crowd rushed up and with
awe and now awakened terror gazed down
into that terrible pit

  we say terrible because in this case
it is an exact adjective the strangest hole
that man ever looked into it was so deep
that at first it appeared to have no bottom
not even the strongest eyesight could pene-
trate the smoldering blackness that
shrouded the depths descending it took
a stout heart and courage to stand and
hold ones head on the brink for even a
minute

   it was straight and precipitous a perfect
rhe man who saved the earth



circle in shape with sides as smooth as
the effect of machine work the pavement
and stone curb had been cut as if by a
razor of the two automobiles and their
occupants there was nothing the whole
thing so silent and complete not even the
spectators could really believe it

  it was a hard thing to believe the
newspapers themselves when the news
came clamoring accepted it with reluct-
ance it was too much like a hoax not
until the most trusted reporters had gone
and had wired in their reports would they
even consider it then the whole world
sat up and took notice

  a miracle like oaklands press we all
of us doubted that hole we had attained
almost everything that was worth the
knowing we were the masters of tie
earth and its secretsand we were proud of
our wisdom naturally we refused such
reports as all out of reason it must be
a hoax

but the wires were persistent came
corroboration a great news syndicate
soon was coming through with elaborate
and detailed accounts of just what was
happening we had the news from the
highest and most reputable authority

  and still we doubted

  then came the scientists as soon as
could be men of great minds had been
hustled to the scene the world had long
been accustomed to accept without quibble
the dictum of these great specialists of
fact with their train of accomplishments
behind them we would hardly be consistent
were we to doubt them

  in a few moments a crowd of many
thousands had gathered about the spot
the throng grew so dense that there was
peril of some of them being crowded into
the pit at the center it took all the spare
policemen of the city to beat them back
far enough to string ropes from the corners
for blocks the streets were packed with
wondering thousands street traffic was
impossible it was necessary to divert the
cars to a roundabout route to keept the
arteries open to the suburbs

  wild rumors spread over the city no
one knew how many passengers had been
upon the street cars the officials of the
company from the schedule could pick the
numbers of the cars and their crews but
who could tell of the occupants

  telephones rang with tearful pleadings
when the first rumors of the horror leaked
out every citizen felt the clutch of panic
it was a moment of historical psychology
out of our books we had read of this
jtrange phase of human nature that was
wont to rise like a mad screeching thing
out of disaster we had never had it in
utopia

  it was rumbling at first and out of
exaggeration as the tale passed farther
back to the waiting thousands it gained
with the repetition grim and terrible
enough in fact it ratioed up with reitera-
tion perhaps after all it was not psy-
chology the average impulse of the
human mind does not even up so exactly
in the light of what we now know it may
have been the poison that had leaked into
the air the new element that was perme-
ating the atmosphere of the city

at first it was spasmodic the near-
est witnesses of the disaster were the
first victims a strange malady began to
spot out among those of the crowd who
had been at the place of contact this
is to be noticed a strange affliction which
from the virulence and rapidity of action
was quite puzzling to the doctors

  those among the physicians who would
consent to statement gave it out that it
was a breaking down of tissue which of
course it was the new element that was
radiating through the atmosphere of the
city they did not know it then

  the pity of it the subtle odorless
pall was silently shrouding out over the
city in a short time the hospitals were
full and it was necessary to call in medical
aid from san francisco they had not
even time for diagnosis the new plague
was fatal almost at conception happily
the scientists made the discovery

  it was the pall at the end of three


famous fantastic mysteries

hours it was known that a death sheet
was spreading out over oakland we may
thank our stars that it was learned so
early had the real warning come a few
hours later the death list would have been
horrifying

  a new element had been discovered or
if not a new element at least something
which was tipping over all the laws of
the atmospheric envelope a new com-
bination that was fatal when the news
and the warning went out panic fell upon
the bay shore

  but some men stuck in the face of
such terror there were those who stayed
and with grimness and sacrifice hung to
their posts for mankind there are some
who had said that the stuff of heroes had
passed away let them consider the case
of john robinson

  robinson was a telegraph operator un-
til that day he was a poor unknown not
a whit better than his fellows now he
has a name that will run in history in
face of what he knew he remained under
the blanket the last words out of oak-
land-his last message

  whole city of oakland in grip of
strange madness keep out of oakland-
following which came a haphazard per-
sonal commentary

  i can feel it coming on myself it is
like what our ancestors must have felt
when they were getting drunk-alternating
desires of fighting and singing-a strange
sensation light and ecstatic with a spas-
modic twitching over the forehead ter-
ribly thirsty will stick it out if i can
get enough water never so dry in my life
followed a lapse of silence then the
last words

  i guess were done for there is some
poison in the atmosphere-something it
has leaked of course out of this thing
at fourteenth and broadway dr manson
of the american institute says it is some-
thing new that is forming a fatal com-
bination but he cannot understand a new
element the quantity is too enormous

  populace has been warned out of the
city all the roads are packed with refu-

gees the berkeley hills are covered as
with flies-north east and south and on
the bots to frisco the poison whatever
it is is advancing in a ring from four-
teenth and broadway you have got to
pass it to these old boys of science they
are staying with that ring already they
have calculated the rate of its advance
and have given warning they dont know
just how fast it is moving they have
sved the city

  i am one of the few men now inside
the wave out of curiosity i have stuck
i have a jug and as long as it lasts i shall
stay strange feeling dry dry dry as
if the juice of ones life cells was turning
into dust water evaporating almost in-
stantly it cannot pass through glass
whatever the poison it has an affinity for
moisture do not understand it perhaps
the scientists can explain it i have had
enough-

  that was all after that there was no
more news out of oakland it is the only
word that we have out of the pall itself
it was short and disconnected and a bit
slangy but for all that a basis from which
to conjecture

  it is a strange and glorious thing how
some men will stick to the post of danger
this operator knew that it meant death
but he held with duty had he been a
man of scientific training his information
might have been of incalculable value
however may god bless his heroic soul

  what we know is thirst the word that
came from the experts confirmed it some
new element or force was stealing or sap-
ping the water gas out of the atmosphere
whether this was combining and entering
into a poison could not be determined

  chemists worked frantically at the out-
posts of the advancing ring in four hours
it had covered the city in six it had
reached san leandro and was advancing
on toward haywards

  it was a strange story and incredible
from the beginning no wonder the world
doubted such a thing had never happened
we had accepted the law of judging the
future by the past by deduction we
the man who saved the earth



were used to sequence and to law to the
laws of nature this thing did look like
a miracle which was merely because-as
usually it is with miracles-we could
not understand it happily we can look
back now and still place our faith in na-
ture

  the world doubted and was afraid was
this peril to spread slowly over the whole
state of california and thence on to the
-world doubt always precedes terror a
tense world waited then came the word
of reassurance from the scientists

  danger past vigor of the ring is abat-
ing calculation has deduced that the wave
is slowly decreasing in potentiality it
will not advance much further it is too
early yet to say that there will be re-
cession as the wave is just reaching its
zenith what it is we cannot say but it
cannot be inexplicable after a little time
it will all be explained say to the world
there is no cause for alarm

  but did the scientists know could they
only have seen the future we know now
that they did not there was but one man
in all the world great enough to foresee
disaster that man was charley huyck

chapter iii

the mountain that was

on the same day on which all this
happened a young man pizzozi by
name and of italian parentage left the
little town of lone in amador county
california with a small truck-load of salt
he was one of the cattlemen whose head-
quarters or home-farms are clustered about
the foot-hills of the sierras in the wet
season they stay with their home-land in
the valley in the summer they penetrate
into the mountains pizzozi had driven in
from the mountains the night before after
salt he had been on the road since mid-
night

  two thousand salt hungry cattle do not
allow time for gossip with the thrift of
his race joe had loaded up his truck and
after a running snatch at breakfast was
headed back into the mountains when

the news out of oakland was thrilling
round the world he was far into the sierras

  the summer quarters of pizzozi were
close to mt heckla whose looming
shoulders rose square in the center of the
pasture of the three brothers it was not
a noted mountain-that is until this day
-and had no reason for a name other
than that it was a peak outstanding from
the range like a thousand others it was
rugged pine clad coated with deer-brush
red soil and mountain miserie

  it was the deer brush that gave it value
to the pizzozis-a succulent feed richer
than alfalfa in the early summer they
would come up with bony cattle when
they returned in the fall they went out
driving beef-steaks but inland cattle must
have more than forage salt is the tincture
that makes them healthy

  it was far past the time of the regular
salting pizzozi was in a hurry it was
nine oclock when he passed through the
mining town of jackson and by twelve
oclock-the minute of the disaster-he
was well beyond the last little hamlet that
linked up with civilization it was four
oclock when he drew up at the little pine-
sheltered cabin that was his headquarters
for the summer

  he had been on the road since midnight
he was tired the long weary hours of
driving the grades the unvaried stress
through the deep red dust the heat the
stretch of a night and day had worn
both mind and muscle it had been his
turn to go after salt now that he was
here he could lie in for a bit of rest while
his brothers did the salting

  it was a peaceful spot this cabin of the
pizzozis nestled among the virgin shade
trees great tall feathery sugar-pines with
a mountain live-oak spreading over the
door yard to the east the rising heights
of the sierras misty gray-green undu-
lating into the distance to the pink-white
snow crests of little alpine below in the
canon the waters of the mokolumne to
the west the heavy dark mass of mt
heckla deep verdant in the cool of coming
evening


famous fantastic mysteries

  joe drew up under the shade of the
live oak the air was jtull of the cool
sweet scent of the afternoon no moment
could have been more peaceful the blue
clear sky overhead the breath of summer
and the soothing spice of the pine trees
a shepherd dog came bounding from the
doorway to meet him

  it was his favorite cow dog usually
when joe came back the dog would be far
down the road to forestall him he had
wondered absently coming up at the
dogs delay a dog is most of all a creature
of habit only something unusual would
detain him however the dog was here
as the man drew up he rushed out to
greet him a rush a circle a bark and
a whine of welcome perhaps the dog had
been asleep

  but joe noticed that whine he was
wise in the ways of dogs when ponto
whined like that there was something un-
usual it was not effusive nor spontaneous
but rather of the delight of succor after
scarce a minute of petting the dog
squatted and faced to the westward his
whine was startling almost fearful

  pizzozi knew that something was wrong
the dog drew up his stub tail erect and
his hair all bristled one look was for his
master and the other whining and alert
to mt heckla puzzled joe gazed at the
mountain but he saw nothing

  was it the canine instinct or was it
just coincidence we have the account
from pizzozi from the words of the
italian the dog was afraid it was not
the way of ponto usually in the face of
danger he was alert and eager now he
drew away to the cabin joe wondered

  inside the shack he found nothing but
evidence of departure there was no sign
of his brothers it was his turn to go to
sleep he was wearied almost to numbness
for forty-eight hours he had not closed
an eyelid on -the table were a few un-
washed dishes and crumbs of eating one
of the three rifles that hung usually on
the wall was missing the coffee pot was
on the floor with the lid open on the bed
the coverlets were mussed up it was a

temptation to go to sleep back of him
the open door and ponto the whine of
the dog drew his will and his conscious-
ness fftto correlation a faint rustle in
the sugar-pines came from the canon

  joe watched the dog the sun was just
glowing over the crest of the mountain
on the western line the deep lacy silhou-
ettes of the pine trees and the bare bald
head of heckla what was it his brothers
should be on hand for the salting it was
not their custom to put off things for the
morrow shading his eyes he stepped out
of the doorway

  the dog rose stealthily and walked be-
side him uneasily with the same insistent
whine and ruffled hair joe listened only
the mountain murmurs the sweet breath
of the forest and in the lapse of bated
breath the rippling melody of the river
far below him

  what you see ponto what you see

  at the words the dog sniffed and ad-
vanced slightly-a growl and then a
sudden scurry to the heels of his master
ponto was afraid it puzzled pizzozi but
whatever it was that roused his fear it
was on mt heckla

this is one of the strange parts of
the story-the part the dog played
and what came after although it is a
trivial thing it is one -of the most inex-
plicable did the dog sense it we have
no measure for the range of instinct but
we do have it that before the destruction
of pompeii the beasts roared in their cages
still knowing what we now know it is
hard to accept the analogy it may after
all have been coincidence

  nevertheless it decided pizzozi the
cattle needed salt he would catch up his
pinto and ride over to the salt logs

  there is no moment in the cattle in-
dustry quite like the salting on the range
it is not the most spectacular perhaps but
surely it is not lacking in intenseness the
way of pizzozi was musical even if not
operatic he had a long-range call a rising
rhythm that for depth and tone had a
peculiar effect on the shattered stillness
the man who saved the earth



it echoed and reverberated and pealed
from the bottom to the top of the moun-
tain the salt call is the talisman of the
mountains

  alleewahoo

  two thousand cattle augmented by a
thousand strays held up their heads in
answer the sniff of the welcome salt call
through the whole range of the mans
voice the stock stopped in their leafy
pasture and listened

  alleewahoo 

  an old cow bellowed it was the be-
ginning of bedlam from the bottom of
the mountain to the top and for miles
beyond went forth the salt call three
thousand head bellowed to the delight
of salting

  pizzozi rode along each lope of his
pinto through the tall tangled miserie was
accented alleewahoo alleewahoo the
rending of brush the confusion and
pandemonium spread to the very bottom
of the leafy gulches it was no place for
a pedestrian heads and tails erect the
cattle were stampeding toward the logs

  a few head had beat him to it these
he quickly drove away and cut the sack
open with haste he poured it upon the
logs then he rose out of the dust that
for yards about the place was tramped
to the finest powder the center of a herd
of salting range stock is no place for com-
fort the man rode away to the left he
ascended a low knob where he would
be safe from the stampede but close
enough to distinguish the brands

  in no time the place was alive with
milling stock old cows heifers bulls
calves steers rushed out of the crashing
brush into the clearing there is no mo-
ment exactly like it what before had
been a broad clearing of brownish reddish
dust was trampled into a vast cloud of
bellowing blur a thousand cattle and still
coming from the farthest height came the
echoing call pizzozi glanced up at the top
of the mountain

  and then a strange thing happened

  from what we gathered from the excited
accounts of pizzozi it was instantaneous

and yet by the same words it was of such
a peculiar and beautiful effect as never
to be forgotten a bluish azure shot
through with a myriad flecks of crimson
a peculiar vividness of opalescence the
whole world scintillating the sky the air
the mountain a vast flame of color so
wide and so intense that there seemed
not a thing beside it and instantaneous-
it was over almost before it was started
no noise nor warning and no subsequent
detonation as silent as winking and much
indeed like the queer blur of color induced
by defective vision all in the fraction of
a second pizzozi had been gazing at the
mountain there was no mountain

  neither were there cattle where before
had been the shade of the towering peak
were now the rays of the western sun
where had been the blur of the milling
herd and its deafening pandemonium was
now a strange silence the transparency
of the air was unbroken into the distance

  far off lay a peaceful range in the sun-
set there was no mountain neither were
there cattle

  for a moment the man had enough to
do with his plunging mustang in the blur
of the subsequent second pizzozi remem-
bers nothing but a convulsion of fighting
horseflesh bucking twisting plunging the
gentle pinto suddenly maddened into a
demon it required all the skill of the
cowman to retain his saddle

  he did not know that he was riding on
the rim of eternity in his mind was the
dim subconscious realization of a thing
that had happened in spite of all his
efforts the horse fought backward it was
some moments before he conquered then
he looked

  it was a slow hesitant moment one
cannot account for what he will do in
the open face of miracle what the italian
beheld was enough for terror the sheer
immensity of the thing was too much for
thinking

  at the first sight his simple mind went
numb from sheer impotence his terror
to a degree frozen the whole of mt
heckla had been shorn away in the place


famous fantastic mysteries

of its darkened shadow the sinking sun
was blinking in his face the whole
western sky all golden there was no
vestige of the flat salt clearing at the base
of the mountain of the two thousand
cattle milling in the dust not a one re-
mained the man crossed himself in stupor
mechanically he put the spurs to the pinto

  but the mustang would not answer
another struggle with bucking fighting
maddened horseflesh the cow-man must
needs bring in all the skill of his-training
but by the time he had conquered his
mind had settled within some scope of
comprehension

  the pony had good reasons for its
terror this time though the mans mind
reeled it did not go numb at the clash
of immensity not only had the whole
mountain been torn away but its roots as
well the whole thing was up-side down
the world torn to its entrails in place of
what had been the height was a gulf so
deep that its depths were blackness

  he was standing on the brink he was
a cool man was pizzozi but it was hard
in the confusion of such a miracle to think
clearly much less to reason the prancing
mustang was snorting terror the man
glanced down

  the very dizziness of the gulf sheer
losing itself into shadows and chaos over-
powered him his mind now clear enough
for perception reeled at the distance the
depth was nauseous his whole body suc-
cumbed to a sudden qualm of weakness
the sickness that comes just before falling
he went limp in the saddle

  but the horse fought backward warned
by instinct it drew back from the sheer
banks of the gulf it had no reason but
its nature at the instant it sensed the
snapping of the iron will of its master in
a moment it had turned and was racing
on its wild way out of the mountains at
supreme moments a cattle horse will al-
ways hit for home the pinto and its limp
rider were fleeting on the road to jackson

  pizzozi had no knowledge of what had
occurred in oakland to him the whole
thing had been but a flash of miracle he

could not reason he did not curb his
horse that he was still in the saddle was
due mare to the near instinct of his train-
ing than to his volition

  he did not even draw up at the cabin
that he could make better time with his
motor than with his pinto did not occur
to him his mind was far too busy and
now that the thing was past too full of
terror it was forty-four miles to town
it was night and the stars were shining
when he rode into jackson

  on this night we find charley at the
observatory in arizona he is a grown
man and a great one and though mature
not so very far drawn from the lad we met
on the street selling papers tall slender
very slightly stooped and with the same
idealistic dreaming eyes of the poet
surely no one at first glance would have
taken him for a scientist which he was
and was not

  indeed there is something vastly differ-
ent about the science of charley huyck
science to be sure but not prosaic he was
the first and perhaps the last of the school
of dr robold a peculiar combination of
poetry and fact a man of vision of vast
far-seeing faith and idealism linked and
based on the coldest and sternest truths of
materialism a peculiar tenet of the theory
of robold true science to be itself
should be half poetry which any of
us who have read or been at school know
it is not it is a peculiar theory and though
rather wild still with some points in favor

the really great scientist should be a
the man who saved the earth



visionary said robold and an inventor
is merely a poet with tools

  which is where we get charley huyck
he was a visionary a scientist a poet
with tools the protege of dr robold he
dreamed things that no scientist had
thought of and we are almighty thankful
for his dreaming

  the one great friend of huyck was
professor williams a man from charlies
home city who had known him even back
n the days of selling papers they had
een cronies in boyhood in their teens
when huyck had become the visionary
the mysterious man of the mountain and
williams a great professor of astronomy
the friendship was as strong as ever

  but there was a difference between them
williams was exact to acuteness with not
a whit of vision beyond pure science he
had been reared in the old stone-cold
theory of exactness he lived in figures
he could not understand huyck nor his
reasoning perfectly willing to follow as
far as facts permitted he refused to step
off into speculation

  which was the point between them
charley huyck had vision although exact
as any man he had ever one part of his
mind soaring out into speculation what
is and what might be and the gulf be-
tween to bridge the gulf was the life
work of charley huyck

  in the snug little office in arizona we
find them charley with his feet poised
n the desk and williams precise and
punctilious true to his training defending
the exactness of his philosophy it was
the cool of the evening the sun had just
set and the softness of the night was just
mellowing the heat of the desert through
the open door and windows a cool wind
was blowing charley was smoking the
same old pipe that had been the bane of
williams life- at college

  then we know he was asking

  yes spoke the professor what we
know charley we know though of course
it is not much it is very hard nay im-
possible to deny figures we haviir not
only the proofs of geology but of astronomi-

cal calculation we have facts and figures
plus our sidereal relations all about us

  the world must come to an end it is
a hard thing to say it but it is a fact
of science slowly inevitably ruthlessly
the end will come a mere -question of
arithmetic

  huyck nodded it was his special func-
tion in life to differ with his former room-
mate he had come down from his own
mountain in colorado just for the delight
of the difference

  i see your old calculation of tidal
retardation or if that doesnt work the
loss of oxygen and the water

  either one or the other a matter of
figures the earth is being drawn every
day by the sun its rotation is slowing up
when the time comes it will act to the sun
in exactly the same manner as the moon
acts to the earth today

  i understand it will be a case of
eternal night for one side of the earth
and eternal day for the other a case of
burn up or freeze up

   exactly or if it doesnt reach to that
the water gas will gradually lose out into
sidereal space and we will go to desert
merely a question of the old dynamical
theory of gases of the molecules to be in
motion to be forever colliding and shoot-
ing out into variance

  each minute each hour each day we
are losing part of our atmospheric enve-
lope in course of time it will all be gone
when it is we shall be all desert for in-
stance take a look outside this is ari-
zona once it was the bottom of a deep
blue sea why deny when we can already
behold the beginning

  the other laughed

  pretty good mathematics at that pro-
fessor only-

  only

  that is merely mathematics

arerely mathematics the pro-
-afessor frowned slightly mathema-
tics do not lie charlie you cannot get
away from them what sort of fanciful
argument are you bringing up now


famous fantastic mysteries

  simply this returned the other that
you depend too much on figures they are
material and in the nature of things can
only be employed in a calculation of what
may happen in the future you must have
premises to stand on facts your figures
are rigid they have no elasticity unless
your foundations are permanent and fault-
less your deductions will lead you only
into error

  granted just the point we know
where we stand wherein are we in error
it was the old point of difference huyck
was ever crashing down the idols of pure
materialism williams was of the world-
wide school

  you are in error my dear professor
in a very little thing and a very large one
what is this

  man

  man

  yes hes a great little bug you have
left him out of your calculation-which
he will upset

  the professor smiled indulgently ill
allow he is at least a conceited bug but
you surely cannot grant him much when
pitted against the universe

  no did it ever occur to you pro-
fessor what the universe is the stars
for instance space the unmeasurable
distance of infinity have you never
dreamed

  williams could not quite grasp him
huyck had a habit that had grown out
of childhood always he would allow his
opponent to commit himself the pro-
fessor did not answer but the other spoke
ether you know it whether mind
or granite for instance your desert he
placed his finger to his forehead your
mind my mind-localized ether

  what are you driving at

  merely this your universe has in-
telligence it has mind as well as matter
the little knot called the earth is be-
coming conscious your deductions are in-
competent unless they embrace mind as
well as matter and they cannot do it
your mathematics are worthless

  the professor bit his lip	

  always fanciful he commented and
visionary your argument is beautiful
charly and hopeful i would that it were
true but all things must mature even an
earth must die

   not our earth you look into the past
professor for your proof and i look into
the future give a planet long enough
time in maturing and it will develop life
give it still longer and it will produce in-
telligence our own earth is just coming
into consciousness it has thirty million
years at least to run

  you mean

  this that man is a great little bug
mind the intelligence of the earth

  this of course is a bit dry the con-
versation of such men very often is to
those who do not care to follow them but
it is very pertinent to what came after we
know now every one knows that charley
huyck was right even professor williams
admits it our earth is conscious in less
than twenty-four hours it was necessary
to employ its consciousness to save itself
from destruction

  a bell rang it was the private wire
that connected the office with the residence
the professor picked up the receiver just
a minute yes all right then to his
companion i must go over to the house
charley we have plenty of time then
we can go up to the observatory

  which shows how little we know about
ourselves poor professor williams little
did he think that those casual words were
the last he would ever speak to charley
huyck

  the whole world seething the be-
ginning of the end charley huyck in
the vortex the next few hours were to
be the most strenuous of the planets
history

chapter v

approaching disaster

it was night the stars which had just
been coming out were spotted by
millions over the sleeping desert one of
the nights that are peculiar to the country
the man who saved the earth



which we all of us know so well if not
from experience at least from hearsay
mellow soft sprinkled like salted fire
twinkling

  each little light a message out of in-
finity cosmic grandeur mind chaos
eternity-a night for dreaming whoever
had chosen the spot in the desert had
picked full well charley had spoken of
consciousness on that night when he
gazed up at the stars he was its personifi-
cation surely a good spirit was watching
over the earth

  a cool wind was blowing on its breath
floated the murmurs from the village
laughter the song of children the purring
of motors and the startled barking of a
dog the confused drone of man and his
civilization from the eminence the ob-
servatory looked down upon the town and
the sheen of light spotting like jewels in
the dim gloom of the desert-to the east
the mellow moon just tipping over the
mountain charley stepped to the window

  he could see it all the subtle beauty
that was so akin to poetry the stretch
of the desert the mountains the light in
the eastern sky the dull level shadow that
marked the plain to the northward to
the west the mountains looming black to
the star line a beautiful night sweet-
ened with the breath of desert and tuned
to its slumber

  across the lawn he watched the profes-
sor descending the pathway under the
acacias an automobile was coming up the
driveway as it drove up under the arcs
he noticed its powerful lines and its driver
the soft purr of its motor its coating of
dust there is a lure about a great car
coming in from the desert the car stopped
charley noted doubtless someone for wil-
liams if it were he would go into the
observatory alone

  in the strict sense of the word huyck
was not an astronomer he had not made
it his profession but for all that he knew
things about the stars that the more exact
professors had not dreamed of between
him and the stars lay a secret

  he crossed the office passed through the

reception-room and thence to the stairs
that led to the observatory in the time
that would lapse before the coming of his
friend he would have ample time for his
observation somehow he felt that there
was time for discovery he had come down
to arizona to employ the lens of his friend
the astronomer the instrument that he
had erected on his own mountain in colo-
rado had not given him the full satisfac-
tion that he expected here in arizona
in the dry clear air which had hitherto
given such splendid results he hoped to
find what he was after but little did he
expect to discover the terrible thing he
did

  it is one of the strange parts of the story
-that he should be here at the very mo-
ment when fate and the worlds safety
would have had him

  the boy and the burning glass had
grown under the tutelage of dr robold
the time was about at hand when he could
out-rival the saying of archimedes
though the world knew it not charley
huyck had arrived at the point where he
could literally burn up the earth

  but he was not sinister though he had
the power he had of course not the slight-
est intention he was a dreamer and it
was part of his dream that man break his
thraldom to the earth and reach out into
the universe it was a great conception
and were it not for the terrible event which
took his life we have no doubt but what
he would have succeeded

  it was ten thirty when he mounted the
steps and seated himself he glanced at
his watch he had a good ten minutes he
had computed before just the time for the
observation for months he had waited for
just this moment he had not hoped to
be alone and now that he was in solitary
possession he counted himself fortunate
only the stars and charley huyck knew
the secret and not even he dreamed what
it would amount to

  from his pocket he drew a number of
papers most of them covered with nota-
tions some with drawings and a good
sized map in colors this he spread before


famous fantastic mysteries

him and with his pencil began to draw
right across its face a net of lines and cross
lines a number of figures and a rapid
computation he nodded and then he made
the observation

it would have been interesting to
study the face of charley huyck dur-
ing the next few moments at first he was
merely receptive his face placid but with
the studious intentness of one who has
come to the moment and as he began to
find what he was after an eagerness of
satisfaction then a queer blankness the
slight movement of his body stopped and
the tapping of his feet ceased entirely

  for a full five minutes an absolute in-
tentness during that time he was out
among the stars beholding what not even
he had dreamed of it was more than a
secret and what it was only charley
huyck of all the millions of men could
have recognized yet it was more than
even he had expected when he at last

drew away his face was chalklike great
drops of sweat stood on his forehead and
the terrible truth in his eyes made him look
ten years older

 my god

  for a moment indecision and strange
impotence the truth he had beheld
numbed action from his lips the mumbled
words

  this world my world our great and
splendid mankind

  a sentence that was despair and a bene-
diction

  then mechanically he turned back to
confirm his observation this time know-
ing what he would see he was not so hor-
rified his mind was cleared by the plain
fact of what he was beholding

  when at last he drew away his face was
settled

  he had been dreaming all his life he
had never thought that the climax was to
be the very opposite of what he hoped for
in his under mind he prayed for dr ro-

breath sweetenerdelightful confection

- 

bold-dead and gone forever were he only
here to help him

  he seized a piece of paper over its
white face he ran a mass of computations
he worked like lightning his fingers ply-
ing and his mind keyed to the pin-point of
genius not one thing did he overlook
in his calculation if the earth had a chance
he would find it

  there are always possibilities he was
working out the odds of the greatest race
since creation while the whole world slept
while the uncounted millions lay down in
fond security charley huyck there in the
lonely room on the desert drew out their
figured odds to the point of infinity

  just one chance in a million

  he was going to take it the words were
not out of his mouth before his long legs
were leaping down the stairway in the
flash of seconds his mind was rushing into
clear action he had had years of dream-
ing all his years of study and tutelage
under robold gave him just the training
for such a disaster

  but he needed time time time why
was it so precious he must get to his
own mountain in six jumps he was in the
office

  it was empty the professor had not re-
turned he thought rather grimly and fleet-
ingly of their conversation a few minutes
before what would williams think now of
science and consciousness he picked up
the telephone while he waited he saw out
of the corner of his eye the car in the
driveway it was-

  hello the professor what gone
down to the town no well say this is
charley-he was watching the car in front
of the building say hello-tell him i
have gone home home h-o-m-e to colo-
rado-to colorado yes-to the mountain
-the m-o-u-n-t-a-i-n oh never mind-ill
leave a note

  he clamped down the receiver on the
desk he scrawled rapidly on a piece of
paper

   ed look these up im bound for the
  mountain no time to explain theres atar
  outside stay with the lens dont leave it

  if the earth goes up you will know that i

  have not reached the mountain

  beside the note he placed one of the
maps that he had in his pocket with his
pencil drew a black cross just above the
center under the map were a- number of
computations

  it is interesting to note that in the
stress of the great critical moment he for-
got the professors title it was a good
thing when williams read it he recognized
the significance all through their life in
crucial moments he had been ed to
charley

  but the note was all he was destined
to find a brisk wind was blowing by a
strange balance of fate the same movement
that let huyck out of the building ushered
in the wind to upset calculation

  it was a little thing but it was enough
to keep all the world in ignorance and
despair the eddy whisking in through the
door picked up the precious map poised
it like a tiny plane and dropped it neatly
behind a bookcase

chapter vi

a race to save the world

huyck was working in a straight line
almost before his last words on the
phone were spoken he had requisitioned
that automobile outside whether money
or talk faith or force he was going to
have it the hum of the motor sounded in
his ears as he ran down the steps he was
hatless and in his shirt-sleeves the driver
was just putting some tools in the car with
one jump charley had him by the collar

  five thousand dollars if you can get
me to robold mountain within twenty
hours

  the very suddenness of the rush caught
the man by surprise and lurched him
against the car turning him half around
charley found himself gazing into dull
brown eyes and sardonic laughter a long
thin nose and lips drooped at the corners
then as suddenly tipping up-a queer
creature half devil half laughter and all
fun


famous fantastic mysteries

  easy charley easy how much did
you say whisper it

  it was bob winters bob winters and
his car and waiting surely no twist of
fortune could have been greater he was
a college chum of huycks and of the pro-
fessors if there was one man that could
make the run in the time allotted bob was
he but huyck was impersonal with the
burden on his mind he thought of naught
but his destination

  ten thousand he shouted

  the man held back his head huyck
was far too serious to appreciate mischief
but not the man

  charley huyck of all men did young
lochinvar come out of the west how
much did you say this desert air and
the dust tis hard on the hearing she
must be a young fair maiden ten thou-
sand

  twenty thousand thirty thousand
damnation man you can have the moun-
tain into the car

  by sheer subjective strength he forced
the other into the machine it was not
until they were shooting out of the
grounds on two wheels that he realized
that the man was bob winters still the
workings of fate

  the madcap and wild bob of the races
surely destiny was on the job the chal-
lenge of speed and the premium at the
opportune moment before disaster the two
men were brought together minutes
weighed up with centuries and hours out-
balanced millenniums the whole world
slept little-did it dream that its very
life was riding north with these two men
into the midnight	

  winters wondered through miles and
miles of fleeting sagebrush cacti and sand
and desolation he rolled over the prob-
lem steady as a rock slightly stooped
grim and as certain as steel he held to
the north charley huyck by his side
hatless coatless his hair dancing to the
wind all impatience why was it

  the whole thing spelled speed to bob
winters perhaps it was the infusion of
spirit or the intensity of his companion

but the thrill ran into his vitals thirty
thousand dollars-for a stake like that-
what-tras the balance he had been called
wild bob for his daring some had called
him insane on this night his insanity was
enchantment

  it was wild the lee of the giant roadster
a whirring seethe of gravel into the dark-
ness into the night the car fought over
the distance

  they were moving slowly minute by
minute they were cutting down the odds
that bore disaster in his mind was a maze
of figures the terrible sight he had seen
in the telescope and the thing impending
why had he kept his secret

  over and again he impeached himself
and dr robold it had come to this the

                                          

whole world sleeping and only himself
to save it oh for a few minutes for one
short moment would he get it

  at last they reached the mountains a
rough rocky road and but little traveled
happily winters had made it once be-
fore and knew it he took it with every
bit of speed they could stand but even
at that it was diminished to a minimum

fi or hours they fought over grades and
gulches dry washouts and growing
pink when they rode down again onto
the level it was here that they ran across
their first trouble and it was here that
winters began to realize vaguely what a
race they might be running

  the particular level which they had
entered was an elbow of the desert pro-
jecting into the mountains just below a
massive newly constructed dam it was
a great new project of reclamation the
reservoir had but lately been filled and
all was being put in readiness for the dedi-
cation

  an immense sheet of water extending
far back into the mountains which was
intended before long to transform the
desert into roses below in the valley was
a town already the center of a prosperous
irrigation settlement but soon with the
added area to become a flourishing city
the elbow where they struck it was per-
the man who saved the earth



haps twenty miles across their northward
path would take them just outside the
tip where the foothills of the opposite
mountain chain melted into the desert
without ado winters put on all speed and
plunged across the sands and then

  it was much like winking but for all
that something far more impressive to
winters on the left hand of the car and
with the east on the right hand it was
much as if the sun had suddenly leaped
up and as suddenly plumped down behind
the horizon-a vast vividness of scintil-
lating opalescence an azure flaming dia-
mond shot by a billion fire points

  instantaneous and beautiful in the
pale dawn of the desert air its wonder
and color were beyond all beauty win-
ters caught it out of the corner of his
eye it was so instantaneous and so illu-
sive that he was not certain instinctively
he looked to his companion

  but charley too had seen it his atti-
tude of waiting and hoping was vigorized
into vivid action he knew just what it
was with one hand he clutched winters
and fairly shouted

  on on bob on as you value your
life put her into every bit of speed you
have got

  at the same instant at the same breath
came a roar that was not to be forgotten
crunching rolling terrible-like the moun-
tain moving

  bob knew it it was the dam some-
thing had broken it to the east the
great wall of water falling out of the
mountains a beautiful sight and terrible
relentless glassy roller fringed along its
base by a lace of racing foam the upper
part was as smooth as crystal the stored-
up waters of the mountains moving out
compactly the man thought of the little
town below and its peril but huyck
thought also he shouted in winters ear
never mind the town keep straight
north over yonder to the point of the
water the town will have to drown

  it was inexorable there was no pity
the very strength and purpose ofthe
command drove into the others under-

standing dimly now he realized that
they were really running a race against
time winters was a daredevil the very
catastrophe sent a thrill of exultation
through him it was the climax the great
moment of his life to be driving at a
hundred miles an hour under that wall of
water

  the roar was terrible before they were
half across it seemed to the two men that
the verysound would drown them there
was nothing in the world but pandemon-
ium the strange flash was forgotten in
the terror of the living wall that was
reaching out to engulf them like in-
sects they whizzed in the open face of
the deluge when they had reached the
tip they were so close that the out-running
fringe of the surf was at their wheels

  around the point with the wide open
plain before them with the flood behind
them it was nothing to outrun it the
waters with a wider stretch spread out
in a few moments they had left it behind
them

  but winters wondered what was the
strange flash of evanescent beauty he
knew this dam and its construction to
outlast the centuries it had been whiffed
in a second it was not lightning he
had heard no sound other than the rush
of the waters he looked to his companion

  huyck nodded

  thats the thing we are racing we
have only a few hours can we make it

  bob had thought that he was getting
all the speed possible out of his motor
what it yielded from that moment on
was a revelation

  it is not safe nor hardly possible to be
driving at such speed on the desert only
the best car and a firm roadway can stand
it a sudden rut squirrel hole or pocket
of sand is as good as destruction they
rushed on till noon

  not even winters with all his alertness
could avoid it perhaps he was weary
the tedious hours the racking speed had
worn to exhaustion they had ceased to
individualize their way a blur a night-
mare of speed and distance


famous fantastic mysteries

  it came suddenly a blind barranca-
one of those sunken useless channels that
are death to the unwary no warning

  it was over just that quickly a mere
flash of consciousness plus a sensation of
flying two men broken on the sands and
the great beautiful car a twisted ruin

chapter vii

a riven continent

but back to the world no one knew
about charley huyck nor what was
occurring on the desert even if we had
it would have been impossible to construe
connection

  after the news out of oakland and
the destruction of mfc heckla we were
far too appalled the whole thing was
beyond us not even the scientists with
all their data could find one thing to work
on the wires of the world buzzed with
wonder and with panic we were civilized
it is really strange how quickly in spite
of our boasted powers we revert to the
primitive

  superstition cannot die where was no
explanation must be miracle the thing
had been repeated when would it strike
again and where

  there was not long to wait but this
time the stroke was of far more con-
sequence and of far more terror the sheer
might of the thing shook the earth not
a man nor government but what resigned
in the face of such destruction

  it was omnipotent a whole continent
had been riven it would be impossible to
give description of such catastrophe no
pen can tell it any more than it could
describe the creation we can only follow
in its path

  on the morning after the first catas-
trophe at eight oclock just south of the
little city of santa cruz on the north shore
of the bay of monterey the same light
and the same though not quite the same
instantaneousness those who beheld it
report a vast ball of azure blue and
opalescent fire and motion a strange sen-
sation of vitalized vibration of personified

living force in shape like a marble as
round as a full moon in its glory but of
infinitely more beauty

  it came from nowhere neither from
above the earth nor below it seeming to
leap out of nothing it glided or rather
vanished to the eastward still the effect
of winking though this time perhaps
from a distanced focus more vivid a
dot of marble like a full moon burning
opal searing to the eastward

  and instantaneous gone as soon as it
came noiseless and of fantom beauty
like a finger of the omnipotent tracing
across the world and as terrible the
human mind had never conceived a thing
so vast

  beginning at the sands of the ocean the
whole country had vanished a chasm
twelve miles wide and of unknown depth
running straight to the eastward where
had been farms and homes was nothing
the mountains had been seared like butter
straight as an arrow

  then the roar of the deluge the waters
of the pacific breaking through its sands
and rolling into the gulf of mexico that
there was no heat was evidenced by the
fact that there was no steam the thing
could not be internal yet what was it

  one can only conceive in figures from
the shores of santa cruz to the atlantic
-a few seconds then out into the eastern
ocean straight out into the sea of the
sargasso a great gulf riven straight across
the face of north america

  the path seemed to follow the sun it
bore to the eastward with a slight southern
deviation the mountains it cut like cheese
passing just north of fresno it seared
through the gigantic sierras halfway be-
tween the yosemite and mt whitney
through the pannamints to southern ne-
vada thence across northern arizona new
mexico texas arkansas mississippi
alabama and georgia entering the at-
lantic at a point half-way between bruns-
wick and jacksonville a great canal twelve
miles in width linking the oceans a
cataclysmic blessing today with thous-
ands of ships bearing freight over its water
the man who saved the earth

- 

we can bless that part of the disaster

  but there was more to come so far the
miracle had been sporadic whatever had
been its force it had been fatal only on
point and occasion in a way it had been
local the deadly atmospheric combina-
tion of its aftermath was invariable in its
recession there was no suffering the
death that it dealt was the death of
obliteration but now it entered on an-
other stage

  the world is one vast ball and though
large still a very small place to live in
there are few of us perhaps who look
upon it or even stop to think of it as a
living being yet it is just that it has its
currents life pulse and its fevers it is
coordinate a million things such as the
great streams of the ocean the swirls of
the atmosphere make it a place to live
in and we are conscious only or mostly
through disaster

  a strange thing happened

  the great opal like a mountain of fire
had riven across the continent from the
beginning and with each succession the
thing was magnified but it was not until
it had struck the waters of the atlantic
that we became aware of its full potency
and its fatality

  the earth quivered at the shock and
man stood on his toes in terror in twenty-
four hours our civilization was literally
falling to pieces we were powerful with
the forces that we understood but
against this that had been literally ripped
from the unknown we were insignificant
the whole world was frozen let us see

  into the atlantic the transition
hitherto silence but now the roar of ten
thousand million niagaras the waters of
the ocean rolling catapulting roaring into
the gulf that had been seared in its bosom
the gulf stream cut in two the currents
that tempered our civilization sheared in
a second straight into the sargasso sea
the great opal liquid fire luminescent
a ball like the setting sun lay poised upon
the ocean it was the end of the earth

  what was this thing the whole wofld
knew of it in a second and not a one

could tell in less than forty hours after
its first appearance in oakland it had
consumed a mountain riven a continent
and was drinking up an ocean the tangled
sea of the sargasso dead calm for ages
was c cataract a swirling torrent of mad-
dened waters rushed to the opal-and dis-
appeared

  it was hellish and out of madness as
beautiful as it was uncanny the opal
high as the himalayas brooding upon
the water its myriad colors blending
winking in a fantasm of iridescence the
beauty of its light could be seen a thous-
and miles a thing out of mystery and out
of forces we had discovered many things
and knew much but had guessed no such
thing as this it was vampirish and it
was literally drinking up the earth

  consequences were immediate the
point of contact was fifty miles across
the waters of the atlantic with one accord
turned to the magnet the gulf stream
veered straight from its course and out
across the atlantic the icy currents from
the poles freed from the warmer barrier
descended along the coasts and thence out
into the sargasso sea the temperature of
the temperate zone tipped below the point
of a blizzard

  the first word came out of london
freezing and in july the fruit and
entire harvest of northern europe de-
stroyed by snow the river seine frozen
snow falling in new york crops nipped
with frost as far south as cape hatteras

  a fleet of airplanes was despatched
from the united states and another from
the west coast of africa not half of them
returned those who did reported even
more disaster the reports that were
handed in were appalling they had sailed
straight on it was like flying into the
sun the vividness of the opalescence was
blinding rising for miles above them a
sheen and a flame of living force it was
luring drawing and unholy and of a
beauty that was terror

  only the tardy had escaped it even
drew their motors it was like gravity sud-
denly become vitalized and conscious

thousands of machines vaulted into the
opalescence from those ahead hopelessly
drawn and powerless came back the warn-
ing but hundreds could not escape

  back came the wireless do not
come too close the thing is a magnet
turn back before too late against this
man is insignificant

  then like gnats flitting into fire they
vanished into the opalescence

  the others turned back the whole
world freezing shuddered in horror a
great vampire was brooding over the
earth the greatness that man had at-
tained to was nothing civilization was
tottering in a day we were hopeless

  then came the last revelation the
truth and verity of the disaster and the
threatened climax the water level of all
the coast had gone down vast ebb tides
had gone out not to return stretches of
sand where had been surf extended far
out into the sea then the truth the
thing was drinking up the ocean

chapter viii

the man who saved the earth

it was tragic grim terrible cosmic
out of nowhere had come this thing
that was eating up the earth not a thing
out of all our science had there been to
warn us not a word from all our wise
men we who had built up our civilization
piece by piece were after all but insects

  we were going out in a maze of beauty
into the infinity whence we came hour
by hour the great orb of opalescence grew
in splendor the effect and the beauty of
its lure spread about the earth thrilling
vibrant like suppressed music the old
earth helpless was it possible that out of
her bosom she could not pluck one in-
telligence to save her was there not one
law-no answer

  out on the desert with his face to the
sun lay the answer though almost hope-
less there was still some time and enough
of near miracle to save us a limping
fate in the shape of two indians and a
battered old car at the last moment

  little did the two red men know the
value of the two men found that day on
theujdesert to them the debris of the
mighty car and the prone bodies told
enough of the story they were samari-
tans but there are many ages to bless
them

  as it was there were many hours lost
without it there would have been thous-
ands of lives spared and an almost im-
measurable amount of disaster but we
have still to be thankful charley huyck
was still living

  he had been stunned battered bruised
and unconscious but he had not been
injured vitally there was still enough
left of him to drag himself to the old car
and call for winters his companion as
it happened was in even better shape than
himself and waiting we do not know
how they talked the red men out of their
relic-whether by coaxing by threat or
by force

  straight north two men battered worn
bruised but steadfast bearing in that
limping old motor-car the destiny of the
earth fate was still on the job but badly
crippled

  they had lost many precious hours
winters had forfeited his right to the
thirty thousand he did hot care he
understood vaguely that there was a stake
over and above all money huyck said
nothing he was too maimed and too much
under will-power to think of speaking
what had occurred during the many hours
of their unconsciousness was unknown
to them it was not until they came sheer
upon the gulf that had been riven straight
across the continent that the awful truth
dawned on them

  to winters it was terrible the mere
glimpse of that blackened chasm was ter-
ror it was bottomless so deep that its
depths were cloudy the misty haze of
its uncertain shadows was akin to chaos
he understood vaguely that it was related
to that terrible thing they had beheld in
the morning it was not the power of man
some force had been loosened which was
ripping the earth to its vitals across the
the man who saved the earth

- 

terror of the chasm he made out the dim
outlines of the opposite wall a full twelve
miles across

  for a moment the sight overcame even
huyck himself full well he knew but
knowing as he did the full fact of the
miracle was even more than he expected
his long years under robold his scientific
imagination had given him comprehension
not puny steam nor weird electricity but
force kinetics--out of the universe

  he knew but knowing as he did he
was overcome by the horror such a thing
turned loose upon the earth he had lost
many hours he had but a few hours re-
maining the thought gave him sudden
energy he seized winters by the arm

  to the first town bob to the first
town-a landing field

  there was speed in that motor for all
its decades winters turned about and shot
out in a lateral course parallel to the great
chasm but fof all his speed he could not
keep back his question

 in the name of heaven charley what
did it what is it

  came the answer and it drove the lust
of all speed through winters

  bob said charley it is the end of
the world-if we dont make it but a
few hours left we must have an airplane
i must make the mountain

  it was enough for wild bob he settled
down it was only an old wreck but he
could get speed out of a wheelbarrow he
had never driven a race like this just
once did he speak the words were char-
acteristic

  a worlds record charley and were
going to win just watch us

  and they did

pthere was no time lost in the change

  jl the mere fact of huycks name his
appearance and the manner of his arrival
was enough for the last hours messages
had been pouring in at every post in the
rocky mountains for charley huyck
after the failure of all others many thous-
ands had thought of him	
even the government unappreciative

before had awakened to a belated and
almost frantic eagerness orders were out
that everything no matter what was to
be at his disposal he had been regarded
as visionary but in the face of what had
occurred visions were now the most prac-
tical things for mankind besides pro-
fessor williams had sent out to the world
the strange portent of huycks note for
years there had been mystery on that
mountain could it be

  unfortunately we cannot give it the
description we would like to give few
men outside of the regular employees have
ever been to the mountain of robold
from the very first owing perhaps to the
great forces stored and the danger of
carelessness strangers and visitors had
been barred then too the secrecy of dr
robold-and the respect of his successor
but we know that the burning glass had
grown into the mountain

  bob winters and the aviator are the
only ones to tell us the employees one
and all chose to remain the cataclysm
that followed destroyed the work of huyck
and robold-but not until it had served
the greatest deed that ever came out of
the minds of men and had it not been
for huycks insistence we would not have
even the account that we are giving

  it was he who insisted nay begged
that his companions return while there
was yet a chance full well he knew out
of the universe out of space he had coaxed
the forces that would burn up the earth
the great ball of luminous opalescence
and the diminishing ocean

  there was but one answer through the
imaginative genius of robold and huyck
fate had worked up to the moment the
lad and the burning glass had grown to
archimedes

  what happened

  the plane neared the mountain of ro-
bold the great bald summit and the four
enormous globes of crystal at least we so
assume we have winters word and that
of the aviator that they were of the ap-
pearance of glass perhaps they were not
but we can assume it for description so


famous fantastic mysteries

enormous that were they set upon a
plain they would have overtopped the
highest building ever constructed though
on the height of the mountain and in its
contrast they were not much more than
golf balls

   it was not their size but their effect that
was startling they were alive at least
that is what we have from winters living
luminous burning twisting within with a
thousand blending iridescent beautiful
colors not like electricity but something
infinitely more powerful great mysterious
magnets that huyck had charged out of
chaos glowing with the softest light
the whole mountain brightened as in a
dream and the town of robold at its base
lit up with a beauty that was past behold-
ing

  it was new to winters the great build-
ings and the enormous machinery en-
gines of strangest pattern driven by
forces that the rest of the world had not
thought of not a sound the whole works
a complicated mass covering a hundred
acres driving with a silence that was
magic not a whir nor friction like a
living composite body pulsing and breath-
ing the strange and mysterious force that
had been evolved from huycks theory of
kinetics the four great steel conduits
running from the globes down the side
of the mountain in the center at a point
midway between the globes a massive
steel needle hung on a pivot and pointed
directly at the sun

  winters and the aviator noted it and
wondered from the lower end of the
needle was pouring a luminous stream of
pale-blue opalescence a stream much like
a liquid and of an unholy radiance but
it was not a liquid nor fire nor anything
seen by man before

  it was force we have no better descrip-
tion than the apt phrase of winters
charley huyck was milking the sun as
it dropped from the end of the needle it
separated and flashed in four living streams
to the four globes that took it into storage
the four great wonderful living globes
the four batteries the very sight of their

imprisoned beauty and power was mag-
netic

  the genius of huyck and robold no-
bocfy but the wildest dreamers would have
conceived it the life of the sun and cap-
tive to man at his will and volition and
in the next few minutes we were to lose
it all but in losing it we were to save
ourselves it was fate and nothing else

  there was but one more thing upon
the mountain-the observatory and an-
other needle apparently idle but with a
point much like a gigantic phonograph
needle it rose square out of the observa-
tory and to winters it gave an impres-
sion of a strange gun or some implement
for sighting

  that was all coming with the speed
that they were making the airmen had
no time for further investigation but even
this is comprehensive minus the force
if we only knew more about that or even
its theory we might perhaps reconstruct
the work of huyck and robold

  they made the landing winters with
his nature would be in at the finish but
charley would not have it

  it is death bob he said you have
a wife and babies go back to the world
go back with all the speed you can get
out of your motors get as far away as
you can before the end comes

  with that he bade them a sad farewell
it was the last spoken word that the out-
side world had from charley huyck

  the last seen of him he was running
up the steps of his office as they soared
away and looked back they could see
men the employees scurrying about in
frantic haste to their respective posts and
stations what was it all about little did
the two aviators know little did they
dream that it was the deciding stroke

chapter ix

the most terrific moment in history

still the great ball of opalescence
brooding over the sargasso europe
now was frozen and though it was mid-
summer had gone into winter quarters
the man who saved the earth

- 

the straits of dover were no more the
waters had receded and one could walk f
careful dry-shod from the shores of france
to the chalk cliffs of england the strait
of gibraltar had dried up the mediter-
ranean completely land-locked was cut off
from the tides of the mother ocean

  the whole world going dry not in
ethics but in reality the great vampire
luminous beautiful beyond all ken and
thinking drinking up our life-blood the
atlantic a vast whirlpool

  a strange frenzy had fallen over man-
kind men fought in the streets and died
in madness it was fear of the great un-
known and hysteria at such a moment
the veil of civilization was torn to tatters
man was- reverting to the primeval

 then came the word from charley
huyck flashing and repeating to every
clime and nation in its assurance it was
almost as miraculous as the vampire it-
self for man had surrendered

 to the people of the world
 the strange and terrible opalescence
 which for the past seventy hours has
 been playing havoc with the world is
 not miracle nor of the supernatural but
 a mere manifestation and result of the
 application of celestial kinetics such a
 thing always was and always will be
 possible where there is intelligence to
 control and harness the forces that lie
 about us space is not space exactly but
 an infinite cistern of unknown laws and
 forces we may control certain laws on
 earth but until we reach out farther we
 are but playthings

     man is the intelligence of the earth
  the time will come when he must be
  the intelligence of a great deal of space
  as well at the present time you are
  merely fortunate and a victim of a kind
  fate that i am the instrument of the
  earths salvation is merely chance the
  real man is dr robold when he picked
  me up on the streets i had no idea that
  the sequence of time would drift to
  this moment he took me into his work
  and taught me

    recause he was sensitive and was
  laughed at we worked in secret and
  since his death and out of respect to
  his memory i have continued in the
  same manner rut i have written doflfti
  everything all the laws computations

  formulas-everything and i am now
  willing it to mankind

     robold had a theory on kinetics it
  was strange at first and a thing to laugh
  at but he reduced it to laws as potent
  and as inexorable as the laws of gravi-
  tation

    the luminous opalescence that has
  almost destroyed us is but one of its
  minor manifestationsj it is a message
  of sinister intelligence for back of it
  all is an intelligence yet it is not all
  sinister it is self-preservation the time
  is coming when eons of ages from now
  our own man will be forced to employ
  just such a weapon for his own preser-
  vation either that or we shall die of
  thirst and agony

    let me ask you to remember now
  that whatever you have suffered you
  have saved a world i shall now save
  you and the earth

    in the vaults you will find every-
  thing all the knowledge and discoveries
  of the great dr robold plus a few
  minor findings by myself

    and now i bid you farewell you
  shall soon be fr 

             charley huyck

  a strange message spoken over the
air and flashed out to every clime it
roused and revived the hope of mankind
who was this charley huyck uncounted
millions of men had never heard his name
there were but few very few who had

  a message out of nowhere and of very
dubious and doubtful explanation celes-
tial kinetics undoubtedly but the words
explained nothing however man was
ready to accept anything so long as it
saved him

  for a more lucid explanation we must
go back to the arizona observatory and
professor ed williams and a strange
one it was truly a certain proof that con-
sciousness is more potent far more so
than mere material also that many laws
of our astronomers are very pt to be
overturned in spite of their mathematics

  charley huyck was right you cannot
measure intelligence with a yard-stick
mathematics do not lie but when applied
to consciousness they are very likely to
kick backward that is precisely what had
happened


famous fantastic mysteries

  the suddenness of huycks departure
had puzzled professor williams that
and the note which he found upon the
table it was not like charley to go off
so in the stress of a moment he had not
even taken the time to get his hat and
coat surely something was amiss

  he read the note carefully and with a
deal of wonder

  look these up keep by the lens if
the world goes up you will know that
i have not reached the mountain

  what did he mean besides there was
no data for him to work on he did not
know that an errant breeze had plumped 
the information behind the bookcase
nevertheless he went into the observatory
and for the balance of the night stuck
by the lens

  now there are uncounted millions of
stars in the sky williams had nothing to
go by a needle in the hay-stack were an
easy task compared with the one that he
was allotted the flaming mystery what-
ever it was that huyck had seen was
not caught by the professor still he won-
dered if the world goes up you will
know i have not reached the mountain
what was the meaning

  but he was not worried the professor
loved huyck as a visionary and smiled
not a little at his delightful fancies doubt-
less this was one of them it was not
until the news came flashing out of oak-
land that he began to take it seriously
then followed the disappearance of mount
heckla if the world goes up-it began
to look as if the words had meaning

there was a frantic professor during
the next few days when he was not
with the lens he was flashing out messages
to the world for charley huyck he did
not know that huyck was lying uncon-
scious and almost dead upon the desert
that the world was coming to catastrophe
he knew full well but where was the
man to save it and most of all what
had his friend meant by the words look
these up

  surely there must be some further in-

formation through the long long hours
he stayed with the lens and waited and
he-found nothing

  it was three days who will ever forget
them surely not professor williams he
was sweating blood the whole world was
going to pieces without the trace of an
explanation all the mathematics all the
accumulations of the ages had availed for
nothing charley huyck held the secret
it was in the stars and not an astronomer
could find it

  but with the seventeenth hour came the
turn of fortune the professor was passing
through the office the door was open
and the same fitful wind which had played
the original prank was now just as fitfully
performing restitution williams noticed
a piece of paper protruding from the back
of the bookcase and fluttering in the
breeze he picked it up the first words
that he saw were in the handwriting of
charley huyck he read

    in the last extremity-in the last
  phase when there is no longer any water
  on the earth when even the oxygen of
  the atmospheric envelope has been re-
  duced to minimum-man or whatever
  form of intelligence is then upon the
  earth must go back to the laws which
  governed his forebears necessity must
  ever be the law of evolution there will
  be no water upon the earth but there
  will be an unlimited quantity elsewhere

     by that time for instance the great
  planet jupiter will be in just a con-
  venient state for exploitation gaseous
  now it will be by that time in just
  about the stage when the steam and
  water are condensing into ocean eons
  of millions of years away in the days of
  dire necessity by that time the intelli-
  gence and consciousness of the earth
  will have grown equal to the task

    it is a thing to laugh at perhaps
  just at present but when we consider
  the ratio of mans advance in the last
  hundred years what will it be in a bil-
  lion not all the laws of the universe
  have been discovered by any means

  at present we know nothing who can
  tell

    aye who can tell perhaps we our-
  selves have in store the fate we would
  mete out to another we have a very
  dangerous neighbor close beside us
the man who saved the earth



mars is in dire straits for water and we
know there is life on mars and intelli-
gence the very fact on its face pro-
claims it the oceans have dried up
the only way they have of holding life
is by bringing their water from the
polar snow-caps their canals pro-
nounce an advanced state of cooperative
intelligence there is life upon mars
and in an advanced stage of evolution

   but how far advanced it is a small
planet and consequently eons of ages
in advance of ihe earths evolution in
the nature of things mars cooled off
quickly and life was possible there
while the earth was yet a gaseous mass
she has gone to her maturity and into
her retrogression she is approaching
her end she has had less time to pro-
duce intelligence than intelligence will
have-in the end-upon the earth

   how far has this intelligence pro-
gressed that is the question nature is
a slow worker it took eons of ages to
put life upon the earth  jt took eons of
more ages to make this life conscious
how far will it go how far has it gone
on mars

that was as far as the comments went
he professor dropped his eyes to the
st of the paper it was a map of the
ice of mars and across its center was a
lack cross scratched by the dull point of
soft pencil

he knew the face of mars it was the
scraeus lacus the oasis at the juncture
f a series of canals running much like
ae spokes of a wheel the great uranian
nd alander canals coming in at about
ght angles

in two jumps the professor was in the

observatory with the great lens swung to
focus it was the great moment out of
his lifetime and the strangest and most
eager moment perhaps ever lived by any
astronomer his fingers fairly twitched
with tension there before his view was
the full face of our martian neighbor

  but was it he gasped out a breath of
startled exclamation was it mars that
he gazed at the whole face the whole
thing had been changed before him

  mars has ever been red viewed through
the telescope it has had the most beau-
tiful tinge imaginable red ochre the
weird tinge of the desert in sunset the
color of enchantment and of hell

  for it is so we know that for ages
and ages the planet has been burning up
that life was possible only in the dry sea-
bottoms and under irrigation the rest
where the continents once were was blaz-
ing desert the redness the beauty the
enchantment that we so admired was burn-
ing hell

  all this had changed

  instead of this was a beautiful shade
of iridescent green the red was gone for-
ever the great planet standing in the
heavens had grown into infinite glory like
the great dog star transplanted

  the professor sought out the ascrseus
lacus it was hard to find the whole face
had been transfigured where had been
canals was now the beautiful sheen of green
and verdure he realized what he was be-
holding and what he had never dreamed
of seeing the seas of mars filled up


famous fantastic mysteries

  with the stolen oceans our grim neighbor
had come back to youth but how had it
been done it was horror for our world
the great luminescent ball of opalescence
europe frozen and new york a mass of
ice it was the earths destruction how
long could the thing keep up and whence
did it come from what was it

  he sought for the ascrseus lacus and
he beheld a strange sight at the very
spot where should have been the juncture
of the canals he caught what at first
looked like a pin-point flame a strange
twinkling light with flitting glow of opales-
cence he watched it and he wondered
it seemed to the professor to grow and
he noticed that the green about it was
of a different color it was winking like
a great force and as if alive baneful

  it was what charley huyck had seen
the professor thought of charley he had
hurried to the mountain what could
huyck a mere man do against a thing
like this there was naught to do but
sit and watch it drink of our life-blood
and then--

  it was the message the strange assur-
ance that huyck was flashing over the
world there was no lack of confidence in
the words he was speaking celestial
kinetics so that was the answer cer-
tainly it must be so with the truth before
him williams was a doubter no longer
and charley huyck could save them the
man he had humored eagerly he waited
and stuck by the lens the whole world
waited

it was perhaps the most terrific
moment since creation to describe it
would be like describing doomsday we
all of us went through it and we all of
us thought the end had come that the
earth was torn to atoms and to chaos

  the state of colorado was lurid with
a red light of terror for a thousand miles
the flame shot above the earth and into
space if ever spirit went out in glory
that spirit was charley huyck he had
come to the moment and to archimedes
the whole world rocked to the recoil com-

pared to it the mightiest earthquake was
but a tender shiver the consciousness of
thsearth had spoken

  the professor was knocked upon the
floor he knew not what had happened
out of the windows and to the north the
flame of colorado like the whole world
going up it was the last moment but
he was a scientist to the end he had
sprained his ankle and his face was bleed-
ing but for all that he struggled fought
his way to the telescope and he saw

  the great planet with its sinister bale-
ful wicked light in the center and another
light vastly larger covering up half of
mars what was it it was moving the
truth set him almost to shouting

  it was the answer of charley huyck
and of the world the light grew smaller
almost a pin-point on its way to mars

  the real climax was in silence and of
all the world only professor williams be-
held it the two lights coalesced and
spread out what it was on mars of
course we do not know

  but in a few moments all was gone
only the green of the martian sea winked
in the sunlight the luminous opal was
gone from the sargasso the ocean lay in
peace

  it was a terrible three days had it not
been for the work of robold and huyck
life would have been destroyed the pity
of it is that all of their discoveries have
gone with them not even charley realized
how terrific was the force he was about
to loosen

  he had carefully locked everything in
vaults for a safe delivery to man he had
expected death but not the cataclysm the
whole of mount robold was shorn away
in its place we have a lake fifty miles in
diameter so much for celestial kinetics

  and we look to a green and beautiful
mars we hold no enmity it was but the
law of self-preservation let us hope they
have enough water and that their seas
will hold we dont blame them and we
dont blame ourselves either for that
matter we need what we have and we
hope to keep it

  it isnt necessary to tell that i know

would waggle her flopsy pomp and deplore

but of the things which terminate in
ology i know next to nothing and thank
heaven for it

  yet here am i ruth chasper as i have
introduced myself in three paragraphs
plunging recklessly to tell of what viewed
merely from its scientific side is without
doubt the most wonderful thing which has
happened to the world since thinking
sometimes reasoning women and men were
set upon it to wonder why

  yee-mah yee-mah alla jerma m
somma i

  the words will ring in my ears forever
until i die what do they mean who
uttered them what was she and whence
and why will science in five thousand
years more of groping and striving be able
to answer what cosmic secret might the
interpretation of that wild sweet cry lay
bare or was it but a dying womans wail
of despair

  yee-mah yee-mah alla jerma na
somma

  no it could not have been despair the
creature was too utterly splendid and dar-
ing to have given way to it she would
not have yielded to despair even when she
realized that she had failed and death
was before her it was not despair it was
an undelivered message-a broken link be-
tween two worlds

  so much i allow to my lame imagina-
tion now i will describe what has hap-
pened though i cannot explain it

  rickey moyer is my distant cousin
fourth or fifth rickeys father d b
moyer as a coal baron turned a fearful
lot of carbon into currency in the pennsyl-
vania alleghanies and then died and left
rickey alone to spend it

  coal-grubbing never appealed to
rickey he finished a course at amherst
sold out the mines and traveled he
seemed to have a consuming desire to
know the world he was living in and i
guess that he has a speaking acquaintance
with most of it he should have for he
started out when he was twenty-one years
old and spent ten years globe-gallop-
ing

  quite suddenly he came home again
two years ago built him a bungalow in
the forest on black bear mountain above
the old moyer homestead in center
county and settled down

  with him-and this is where i come in
-he brought count giuseppe natali of
florence they had met somewhere in
borneo both were cosmopolites both
fearless they had been through dangers
together in the dyak country and had
formed a friendship which stuck

  i met the count for the first time last
summer at palm beach not to go into
tiresome details we soon became engaged
count natali is a thoroughly delightful
fellow a gentleman to his slender finger-
tips and no fortune-hunter else he would
not have picked me for ive none to men-
tion unless aunt caroline-but that has
nothing to do with it

  in january of this year count natali
sailed to italy to look after business con-
nected with his ancestral estate i under-
stand that it is immense and boasts
among other attractions an ancient feu-
dal castle which makes one think of that
creepy old romance the mysteries of
udoipho on his return in early april
rickey kidnaped him away from me in
new york and took him off to the penn-
sylvania wilds

  soon afterward came an invitation to
me to come out for a fortnight bringing
my chum carrie andrews with aunt car-
oline for chaperon carrie was of my class
at college we were both staying with aunt
caroline at bayonne

  all three of us thought that it would be
a fine little outing-a sort of rest before
the strenuosities of the summer season
so i at once wired rickey that he was on
naturally i wasnt sorrowful at the pros-
pect of seeing count natali again so soon
i had felt that i had rather a bone to
pick with rickey for sequestrating my
intended as he had

  rickeys haunt on black bear is no end
of a quiet roost and yet there are plenty
of possibilities to while away a couple of
weeks if one cares for them there is
the sky woman



excellent trout-fishing in forge run if
one doesnt mind wading in hip-boots and
meeting an occasional rattlesnake and
there are a number of pleasant motor trips
one can take if one doesnt mind the
rough roads and the hills

  i dont mind these things i was born in
pennsylvania so was aunt caroline who
isnt a bit fussy about such matters as
for carrie she is one of those big slow-
moving non-excitable blond creatures
whom nothing ever seems to disturb she
who would encounter an earthquake or a
boa-constrictor with the same casual in-
terest she would bestow upon a new dance
very like rickey himself carrie is

late in the afternoon of april  we
were deposited from the up-train at
viaduct and saw the wooded spine of old
black bear looming above us across the
valley to the left of the tracks

  viaduct is little more than a signal-
tower a tank a row of laborers shanty-
shacks and ten houses-personally i
dont believe there are ten but i am a
pennsylvanian and i give viaduct the
benefit of a doubt

  count natali met us with rickeys
roadster but rickey was not with him
aunt caroline and carrie were comfor-
tably discreet while the count greeted me
-much more so than a thin-faced woman
telegraph-operator whom i saw watching
us with avid interest from the height of
her tower poor thing how her eyes would
have popped had she known that it was
an honest-to-goodness italian count who
was kissing me or perhaps she did know
anyhow she watched and the proceeding
seemed to have her approval

  my first reflection was that count nat
ali both looked and felt much better with-
out his mustache the coating of tan which
the spring sun was overlaying on his olive
cheeks gave to his thin features the aspect
of an indian chieftain or a bedouin sheik

  a-hem said aunt caroline after she
and carrie had swept the skyline of black
bear for what she deemed a proper inter-
val a-bem and where is richard

  your nephew asked me to make his
amends mme allison replied count
natali he was unavoidably denied the
pleasure of meeting you this evening we
have had a trifle of excitement

  fire remarked aunt caroline wrin-
kling her nose and sniffing i hope it de-
stroyed nothing valuable

  not the bungalow i cried dis-
mayedly i too had noticed an acrid
wood-smoky odor about the counts
clothes

  no he answered our two queries
only a few trees i believe that it is now
entirely under control the railroad author-
ities sent a force of workmen up the moun-
tain to help us i believe that is their
custom-to protect their property

  umph i suppose a spark from one of
their engines started it as usual com-
mented aunt caroline

  not so nothing so prosaic count
natali shook his handsome head it was
a very unusual fire in fact quite an ex-
traordinary occurrence

he turned to lead the way to the car
this began to smack of a mystery i
could see that the count was covertly
excited and i began to feel the thrill of
an adventure

  a second later we were in the car
and discussion of the fire for the time was
ended the count manages a car prettily
he whirled us up the zigzag road to the
summit of black bear

  rickey and the count had been rough-
ing it but in deference to our coming
rickey had imported servants up from the
big house below including mrs sanders
a cook whom aunt caroline had tried
vainly to bribe from his service so we
found everything that three famished and
train-weary wights could desire

chapter ii

the mystery-stone

no rickey was waiting for us at the
bungalow he did not come in until
we were taking our places at table
when he did put in an appearance he was

j


famous fantastic mysteries

in such a scandalous condition that i posi-
tively was ashamed of him his tawny
hair was all topsyturvy and dark with
dust and his khakis and puttees were
smeared with soot and mud not to men-
tion a black streak across the bridge of his
short nose and numerous holes which
flying embers had scorched through his
shirt and trousers

  he did not contrast at all favorably
with count natali who is always perfec-
tion in his get-up though in spite of the
dirt and disarray rickey still contrived to
look cool and efficient

  hello aunt caroline and folkses all
was his welcome he slipped into a chair
and as soon as decency would permit
began to eat like a hungry and hurried
man

  have i said that rickey is a big fellow
no he is-big and blond and ruddy with
small blue eyes above high cheek-bones--
not piggish eyes but friendly and twinkly
and not a little shrewd seeing that he
inherited them from the coal baron

  glad you came ruth he said to me
presently joe-so he always referred to
count giuseppe-has been pining i had
to send for you or the blue devils would
have got him sure hes been as discon-
solate as a bushman whos lost his fetish

  naturally i had nothing to say to this
aunt caroline charged to the rescue she
had been studying rickey sharply

  please dont talk nonsense richard
she cut in tell us about the fire you
look as though you had been rolled in it

  oh yes the fire responded rickey
who had been talking off the top of his
mind and thinking hard about something
else deeper down

  he glanced at count natali and i
think that the count shook his head

  well from aunt caroline

  well echoed rickey we had one
aunty it was some fire too ill inform
the universe while it lasted and now its
out

  a prodigious bite of mrs sanders home-
made biscuit interrupted communication
i could hear aunt carolines toe tapping

  count natali bridged the gap with ques-
tions about our trip but aunt caroline
like an elephant refused to take the
bridge

  what started it she pursued wading

in

  thats what twoscore men have been
laboring all day to discover aunty said
rickey tantalizingly just then i think
that he became aware of aunt carolines
foot for he muttered a hasty word to his
biscuit and at the same time hitched in
his chair

  we thought it was a falling star he
went on freeing his utterance weve
been grubbing an amateur coal-mine in
the mountain on the strength of finding it
and seeing what its made of

  im sure that is nothing to be so secre-
tive about declared aunt caroline

  and did you find the star at the bot-
tom of your mine asked carrie

  yes rickey answered only it isnt
a star he turned his voice on count
natali that section boss is interested
joe he said he has sent for an armful
of dynamite he wants to blast it

  you surely will not allow that
anxiety if not consternationr was in the
counts tones

  not all in a chunk anyway

  aunt caroline set down her teacup with
firmness

  richard will you have the goodness
to inform us just what it is that you have
found in the hole which you will or will not
blast and why she demanded

  a meteorite aunty replied rickey
reduced to terms at least by all the rules
of the game it should be a meteorite its
a large one the heat engendered by the
friction of its hurried transit through our
mundane atmosphere was what started the
fire and led to its discovery

  but why not blast it i asked coming
to aunt carolines aid as she had to
mine is it dangerous is it still too
hot

  why blast it at all queried carrie

  rickey appeared somewhat embar-
rassed which in itself was unnatural
the sky woman



  joe and i may be a pair of blithering
idiots he returned but we are agreed
that this star or meteorite or mystery-
mystery whether star or meteorite-is a
very extraordinary proposition it has-
well it has an uncanny sort of a hand-
made appearance

  aunt caroline drained her third cup of
tea and set it down with a decision that
threatened the china

  richard she said your explana-
tions are as clear as a moshannon fog
the only portion of them which is under-
standable is your hint at your mental con-
dition how far from here is this phenom-
enon i propose to see it before  close
my eyes

  it was evident that this declaration re-
lieved rickey he brightened up

  not more than a mile aunty he an-
swered we can go the best part of the
way in the car and there will be a fine
moon to see by after you folks have
looked the thing over will be time enough
to diagnose my mental symptoms its
either what it ought to be and joe and
i are jack-donkeyed or else its one of
the marvels of the ages

  how intensely interesting you make it
sound mr moyer volunteered carrie
and that ended the table conversation so
far as concerned the meteorite

  i couldnt help being impressed by
rickeys manner the mere fact that he was
excited-and excitement fairly oozed from
his pores-was impressive to one who
knew him but what was he driving at
how on earthcould a meteorite be hand-
made what were we about to see up
yonder on black bear by the light of the
moon if i had possessed a little more
imagination i am sure that i should have
shivered

soon after our meal rickey led the
way to his touring-car and the five
of us piled in we three women sat in the
tonneau which was already occupied by
frisky rickeys skye terrier frisk too
had been digging in the burned ground to
judge by appearances and in bis exuber-

ance at seeing so many old acquaintances
he insisted upon making a mess of our
skirts

  before we started rickey fetched out
from the bungalow an armful of blankets
which he hung over the robe-rail as the
night was quite warm i wondered what he
wanted of them

  we rolled off northwestward along the
crest of black bear ridge behind the
bungalow clearing following a narrow
rutty old lumber trail which i remembered
from having explored it as a child in
search of arbutus honeysuckle and tea-
berries

  after twenty minutes driving which the
difficulties of the road made very slow
we reached the edge of the burned area
a grand moon had risen and cast a
peculiar light on the carpet of ashes which
the fire had left and against which the
jagged stumps of broken trees and the
scorched distorted bodies of those still
standing were limned in sharply defined
silhouettes

  at intervals a light breeze set this ar-
boreal cemetery to creaking and groaning
lugubriously and fanned our faces with
an acrid warmth that was not of the night
somewhere in the dusky distance a bird
was clamoring for the immediate castiga-
tion of poor will nearer at hand an owl
hooted dolefully-doubtless mourning over
having been burned out of her house and
home in a hollow log

  isnt this delightfully spooky whis-
pered carrie who would hobnob with a
ghost with animation were the opportunity
offered and consider herself in luck aunt
caroline sniffed frisky yapped at the owl
i kept still and stared i may be de-
ficient in imagination but i really did
shiver a little the picture was compelling

  rickey halted the car

  he jumped out and shouldered his blan-
kets

  we followed him across the soft crisp
flooring of ashes

  occasionally we passed smoking heaps
where the breeze would stir the embers so
that little spurts of flame leaped up and


famous fantastic mysteries

danced like elves of mischief over the
destruction they had done these were
too far isolated from the main forest
rickey said to be accounted dangerous
besides watch was being kept

  in the center of this desolation we
found the cause of it rickeys mystery-
stone

  where it had fallen in the slope of a
little dip or valley was an ash-strewn pit
some twelve feet across resembling those
shell-craters which one sees in the war
movies through the lower rim of it work-
men with picks and spades had dug a deep
trenchlike passage to the stone itself and
then had undermined it so that it had top-
pled from its first position- and lay along
the trench

  at the bottom of the dip the ashes had
been cleared away and a brisk wood fire
was burning around which a number of
men sat upon logs these were part of
the section gang which the railroad had
sent up to help rickey fight the fire a
strong aroma of coffee was grateful to our
noses after their long struggle with smoke
and soot

  a stockily built man of middle age
detached himself from the group at the
fire as we came over the edge of the dip
he approached rickey an irish brogue
issuing from his broad and exceedingly
grimy countenance

  the dinnymite will be here directly
misther moyer he said removing his
hat shall we be afther crackin her to-
night sor

  his voice was eager his men around the
fire strained forward to catch the reply

  not tonight conoway well do the
job by daylight responded rickey the
old railroad can spare a few of you for
another day cant it

  yis-i suppose assented mr con-
oway evidently disappointed

  you told-your man to fetch drills
pursued rickey

  oh yis sor yere sthill daycided to
bust her open wid pops sor

  yes if there should happen to be any-
thing inside worth looking at we want to

injure it as little as possible fetch up a
torch qt two will you conoway i want
to exhibit our find to the ladies

  we stepped around to the mouth of
the passage and looked at the mystery
and i am afraid were not at first sight
particularly impressed at least i was
not save by its size

  it was a monster of a stone all of fif-
teen feet long and at its middle where its
girth was greatest as thick through as the
height of a tall man i didnt wonder at
the great hole it had torn in the earth
when it struck or the depth to which it
had penetrated the bottom of the socket
from which it had been tipped was nearly
on a level with the floor of the dip the
impact i thought must have jarred a
considerable portion of the mountain

against the newly turned earth of
the excavation it contrasted darkly
its surface must recently have been
molten i touched it with my fingers and
it still was warm small stones gravel
and clods of scorched earth were encrusted
in it like gipsy settings the upper end of
it as it lay which had struck first was
splayed out and blunted

  three of mr conoways men fetched
pine-knot torches and flashed their light
into the passage and the pit i found
the glamour of the thing grow upon me
even a weak imagination was stirred to
ponderings

  it lay in the trough of the trench with
the wavering torchlight flickering over it
a dull-brown somber sullen inert mass of
stone yet it was not of our world it was
material evidence of other worlds beyond
our ken to me astronomy and kindred
sciences had appealed as largely guess
work here was evidence that the stars
were more than mere watchlights set to
brighten our dark ways whence had it
come this unearthly visitant next to
our awe of time is our awe of distance
how many millions of miles had it fallen
the thought dizzied me

  isnt it fortunate that it did not strike
upon rock instead of earth said carrie
the sky woman



pointing to its jammed and misshapen tip

  would have been one grand smash and
nothing left but flinders remarked
rickey i shouldnt have cared to have
been riding in it at the time
nonsense ejaculated aunt caroline
prodding at it with her toes what is
there about it to give you such ideas why
do you suppose that something may be
inside of it

 count natali took a torch from a
laborers hand

  but see madame he urged stepping
into the trench to the head of the stone
and do you come hither too carissima
-this to me-and mile andrews and
see

  i followed until i could peer over his
stooping shoulder aunt caroline and
carrie squeezed in-on the other side we
stared where he pointed

  i see nothing except that it has been
broken said aunt caroline readjusting
her slipping spectacles

 yes madame a fragment has been
chipped away by a hammer-blow now
watch closely

  he moved one of his slender fingers
along the fresh scar tracing a zigzag pat-
tern looking closely we could then see a
darker line in the substance of the rock

  it looks like an irregular seam-a
suture remarked carrie who won honors
in physiology

  it may be only a vein in the rock
suggested aunt caroline but her skepti-
cism was shaky

  too regular aunty countered rickey
its a joint and a devilish clever one
and its closed with some kind of cement
that is harder than adamant what do
you say conoway

  the same as i did at first sor the
irishman answered theres something
inside of that there that somewan put
there for to stay sor unless the bodies
up yon are gunnin for us down here an
their projacktul didnt go off conoway
pointed toward the stars

no i dont think its a heavenly
dud  laughed rickey and added so-

berly but just the same someone up
there may have fired it

  i am going home and going to bed
announced aunt caroline backing out oi
the trench

  joe will drive you girls back said
rickey

  what are you going to do asked
aunt

  sleep by it rickey tumbled his blan-
kets into the trench some of these chaps
here have it in their heads that this stone
is a kind of wandering treasure chest full
of diamonds and gold and that theyve
only to crack it to see em come pouring
out im going to guard against anything
premature

  all right aunt caroline assented
dont you dare to open that thing rich-
ard until i am here in the morning i
shall get up at half-past eight

  right-o aunty if anyone tries to
dynamite it before you get on the job
hell have to blow me to glory along with
it

  in which case you might find out where
it came from and why said carrie on
the way back to the bungalow she asked
what did mr conoway mean by pops
i wonder

  it is that they will drill the stone
full of small holes mademoiselle ex-
plained count natali and explode the
dynamite in light charges chipping away
the stone a fraction at a time

chapter iii

what the stone contained

less prepossessing but more mystery-
laden was the big stone by the light
of next mornings sun we arrived at the
scene of operations shortly after nine o-
clock aunt caroline having made the
concession of rising earlier than she had
promised the preparations for blasting
were in full swing

  three power-drills had been lugged up
the mountainside in the nieht and six
swarthy workmen were busy along the
trench attacking the surface of the stone


famous fantastic mysteries

with an uproar which must have resembled
a continuous volley of machine guns a
dozen others were vsaiting to spell them
the balance of the fire-fighting force much
against their inclinations had been herded
down the mountain by mr conoway to
less interesting employment

  i noticed that all of the laborers with
the exception of the irishman treated
count natali with an obsequious deference
rather strange to an american until one
reflected that most of them probably were
italians and the others from lands where
counts count for more than they do here

  viewed by daylight the irregular line
in the substance of the stone which had
been disclosed by the hammer-blow and
which carrie had dubbed a suture was
even more noticeable than it had been
under the torches

  count natali found us a position near
the rim of the little amphitheater from
where we could watch the proceedings
safely and where we could talk undis-
turbed by the clattering popping drills
which made conversation in their imme-
diate vicinity an impossibility

  presently came rickey dirtier and more
elated than ever to announce

  well be blasting in another half hour
weve been at her since sun-up

  aunt caroline who had once more in-
spected the odd jointlike appearance of
the stone was disposed to argue

  isnt it quite possible richard that it
is something let fall from an airplane
she asked these aviators are becoming as
careless as motorists

  from the corners of her eyes she glanced
in the direction of count natali

  considering that it must weigh all of
twenty tons im afraid that your sugges-
tion is hardly tenable aunty replied
rickey his eyes twinkling aviators dont
carry such pebbles around for ballast
some time ago i read in the news-
papers that attempts were to be made to
signal to mars at about this time mightnt
it be that this is some sort of a jules
verne projectile which has been fired from
earth and fallen back

  this was from carrie aunt caroline
gave her an approving look

  rictcey smiled and went down among
the workmen what a big capable fellow
he was mr conoway who cared noth-
ing for counts was in his irish way as
deferential to rickey as were the other
to the nobleman

soon after the expiration of the hali
hour the clamor of the drills ceased
they had pecked a neat double row ol
holes along the upper side of the stone
one by one the holes were charged with
dynamite and the explosive set off from
a hand battery they cracked like big
firecrackers at each explosion a shower
of fragments flew up from the surface ot
the stone and fell around the lower part
of the dip

  when the first row of holes had been
blown out count natali went down to
inspect the work from where we sat we
could see that the stone was beginning to
present a gnawed and ill-used appearance

  nothing at all was the counts re-
port as he came back

  an explosion of greater violence than
any of the others followed

  after the crash there sounded a hissing
like that of escaping steam the laborers
below ran toward the- trench shouting

  rickey thrust his arm recklessly into
the opening then he called for a drill-
rod which mr conoway handed to him
and i saw its slender length disappear in
the stone and heard the clink of it as he
groped around in the inside

  does he expect to find a rabbit aunt
caroline murmured

  it is that there is a cavity and another
stone is within reported count natali
it is very strange it has the appearance
of a sarcophagus his fingers trembled as
he stroked the place where his mustache
had been i believe that it is a find

  a mummy thats not so bad ex-
claimed aunt caroline triumphantly she
had caught at the word sarcophagus i
knew someone must have dropped the
thing they must have been hurrying it
the sky woman



to some museum probably it will be
advertised

  how interesting if it is the mummy of
a martian put in carrie not without
malice and drew a quick nonsense
from aunt

  a number of blasts followed in rapid
succession the great stone seemed to
leap and crumble in its bed i shrieked
for several objects like coiled serpents
flew into the air whirling and one of them
nearly fell on my foot

  count natali stooped down and picked
it up

  it was a powerful metal spring

  only a glance we bestowed upon it and
then stared down the hillside

  where had been the long brown mass of
stone was a heap of debris and earth
fallen from the treneh partly buried in
the pile was a cylinder more slender and
shapely than its husk had been its sur-
face was polished and it reflected the
light of the sun in a greenish sheen

  we arose and went down to it

  it was like a great coffin hewn for a
giant whether it was of stone or metal
we could not tell in one spot a fragment
had been chipped away by the blasts and
the fracture was scintillant with tiny par-
ticles which refracted the light vividly at
intervals the entire surface was pitted with
sockets for the springs which had main-
tained it centered in the interior vacuum of
its shell there had been many springs
nearly two hundred

  mr conoways workmen gathered about
the trench shouting chattering and ges-
ticulating they were inclined to crowd us
until at a stern word from count natali
they drew to one side

  i laid a hand upon the cylinder and 
shivered it was chill as ice with an un-
earthly cold

  aunt caroline stared down at it and
shuddered from other motives

  what a godlike way to be buried
soliloquized carrie to be hurled out
through uncounted millions of miles of
space and rest at last upon an unknown
world 

- aunt carolines nonsense was no-
ably weak

  why do you folkses all take it so for
granted that theres a dead one in here
asked rickey clapping a hand on the
cylinder and drawing it hastily away

  rickey i cried you dont mean to
suggest that there may be something alive
in there

  well and why not those chaps who
were clever enough to shoot it across
should know some way to preserve life
for the few months necessary for the
transit i shall not be surprised to find the
traveler in good condition and famously
ready for his breakfast

  months yes rickey was right about
that i hadnt reflected that it might take
nearly a year for an object to fall from
mars to the earth if this thing was from
mars

  when is the opening scheduled to be
carrie inquired i am anxious to meet
the gentleman and he cant be very com-
fortable in that box

  i should think that he or it-if any-
thing living was sealed in there-would be
frozen i said thinking of the intense
cold i had felt

  count natali in turn stooped and laid
a hand on the sarcophagus

  but that was the purpose of the vac-
uum space carissima mia he explained
oblivious of the stares which this endear-
ment drew from his countrymen to pro-
vide an intervening coldness so that what
was within might not be destroyed by the
heat which fused the surface of the stone it
is like a monster thermos bottle

  aunt caroline glanced from one to an-
other of us in bewilderment

chapter iv

the crystal casket

our dark-skinned laborers were wait-
ing with unconcealed impatience to
attack the job not for them were fanci-
ful spectulations as to where the strange
object might have come from to them it
was a treasure trove in which they pos-


famous fantastic mysteries

siblv might share at an order from mr
conoway they swarmed into the trench
and loose earth and stones began to fly
rickey seized an extra spade and his two
great bronzed arms did double the work of
the best of them

  count natali fetched the blankets down
the slope and fixed another seat for us

  before the trench was more than par-
tially cleared we could see that a clearly
marked line of junction extended length-
wise around the sarcophagus cover had
been joined to body with great exactness
and only the thinnest of red lines indi-
cated the presence of a cement at inter-
vals along the sides of the sarcophagus
some manner of sockets larger than those
in which the spring had been fitted had
been sunk on the juncture line and these
too were filled with the reddish substance

  rickey dug at one of them with the
nail-file in his penknife

  hello this stuff isnt so hard he
said fetch some chisels somebody and
well clear these places out

  buried in the cement of each socket was
a bent metal bar or l-shaped handle
similar to those upon kitchen water-taps
some of them were turned upwards and
others down but all were at right angles
to the cement-filled line

  as the sarcophagus lay somewhat askew
in the trench crowbars were applied until
is rested squarely upon its bottom then
rickey tightened a wrench upon one of
the sunken handles and held it while mr
conoway struck it a smart tap with a
hammer it turned slowly at first and
then more easily until it stopped on a
line with the cemented joint of the sarcoph-
agus

  one after another all the handles were
turned still the joint was firm under
rickeys direction an octette of workers
set the blades of chisels and the points of
their crowbars at intervals along the line
and as many more men with hammers or
pieces of stone struck upon them simulta-
neously

  a shout went up as the stubborn lid was
en to be yielding and rising at just the

right instant rickey thrust a crowbar into
the widening interstice and pried with all
hisbroad-shouldered might

  lubricated by the soft cement the huge
lid moved almost without noise balanced
swayed toppled and subsided with a
thunk on the earth of the trench

  we three sprang up and rubbed elbows
with the crowding men but this as was
remarked by mr conoway was a partic-
ularly well-packed parcel nothing of its
contents was to be seen save a mass of
grayish woolly-appearing stuff so tightly
wadded and compressed that it retained
the imprint of the inside of the lid as
though it had been modeling clay

  only mr conoways bellows of restrain
prevented the laborers from stampeding
and making short work of this to such
pitch had risen their eagerness to lay bare
the treasure

  this is your package boss he said
to rickey

  rickey nodded stuck his hands into the
stuff and pulled out no great amount

  gee its rammed in tight enough he
grunted and attacked it again

  curiosity moved count natali to take
a wisp of the wadding step back a few
paces and touch a lighted match to it it
refused to burn or so much as scorch

  huhthe beggars know asbestoscom-
mented rickey who had watched the oper-
ation let your gang tackle this stuff
conoway if theyre so blamed anxious

  aye sor

  but they had understood and did not
wait for the irishmans order a score of
muscular brown hands reaching from both
sides of the sarcophagus seized the asbes-
tos packing and tore it out among them
was one pair of slender womans hands
wrinkled and tremulous aunt caroline
her habitual dignity for the moment in
abeyance was laboring to vindicate her
theory and took her pound of asbestos
with the rest of them the stuff came out
in wads and layers there seemed to be
no end of it dust flew from it and choked
us

  count natali pressed my arm
the sky woman



  how excited we all arc is it not so
carissima he said

  his soft clasp hardened to a grip of
iron and i gasped with the pain of it

  por dio he whispered and again
por dio t

  then for many seconds all our group
was silent and a quarter of a mile down
the slope of black bear i heard plainly
the splash and tinkle of forge run fling-
ing itself endessly over a ten-foot fall

  for a great layer of the asbestos had
come away in the workers hands and
disclosed the contents of the sarcophagus

  as a newly-fallen icicle might lie em-
bedded in a bank of rain-soiled snow a
crystal casket lay glittering against the
bed of dull-gray asbestos which sur-
rounded it and within the caskets gleam-
ing panels lay neither mummy nor man
but a woman with sun-gold hair

 many authors have written that we of 
womankind are prone to see our sisters
through cats eyes and to judge them with
prejudice and jealousy that may be true

i	wont argue it but i another woman
shall think always of the being who lay in
that scintillant crystal casket as the most
beautiful thing that ever came to earth
so poignant was the beauty of her that
mere memory of it hurts

  no language which has yet been written
can make one see the perfections of her-
perfections of every line and contour of
face and figure-and i am not going to
make myself ridiculous by attempting to
put the burden upon my english

  but she was a blonde of a blondness
which made poor carries type look dingy
and scrubby by contrast she lay easily
upon a long cushion affair of soft white
material which had been crinkled and
padded around her until it fitted her as
the satin of a jewel-case fits the brooch
of pearls for which it was made

  it was difficult to believe that such a
radiant thing could die though i suppose
that all of us who were staring into that
crystal casket had no other thought tiian
that she must be dead the casket itself
and all its trappings suggested death but

  its inmate by her easy posture the bloom
of her cheeks and the carmine of her lips
suggested slumber only

  her costume is hardly worth mention-
ing it was-well what a fastidious woman
might have chosen for a nap and scant
her hair flowed loose she wore no jewels
of any kind not so much as a single
finger-ring but had she come to us be-
dizened with gems and arrayed like balkis
she could never have impressed us as she
did lying there in simple white in the white
purity of her glittering crystal casket

   we stared and were as still as she

oddly enough it was mr conoway
who first broke our startled silence

  raymarkably well prayserved isnt
she sor he said to rickey and removed
his hat

  count natalis grip of my arm-the
flesh bore blue fingermarks for days-re-
laxed and with something very like an
oath he caught up one of the blankets and
threw it across the sarcophagus hiding the
casket from profaning eyes

  thank you joe acknowledged rickey
shaking himself as though coming out of
a dream he had not heard mr conoways
first banality the irishman committed a
second

   beloike wan of us had betther be afther
notifyin the coroner sor he remarked
solemnly and put on his hat again

   i will attend to it conoway answered
rickey depend upon it now if i may
impose upon you a bit more ill have your
gang here give us a lift with that casket
and well take it over to the bungalow we
can sling it in the blankets over a couple
of poles

	all this while not a word from aunt
caroline or carrie i stole a peep at them
aunt was weeping softly into her handker-
chief carrie was lost in thought

  mr conoways laborers made a diffi-
culty about complying with rickeys re-
quest when it turned out that there was
no treasure in the sarcophagus they after
their first surprise experienced a rapid loss
of interest replaced by a superstitious


famous fantastic mysteries

  fear of its contents they refused to touch
the crystal case until count natali exert-
ing an influence superior to mr conoways
threats virtually compelled them to do it

  the count drove us slowly back to the
bungalow behind us rickey followed
directing ten of the laborers who walking
two and two carried the casketin a blan-
ket sling

  poor thing poor thing said aunt
caroline recovering speech i shall see
her face to the day of my death dont
talk to me about her please im very
much upset really

  we ate a subdued dinner while the
casket swathed in blankets lay upon the
floor in rickeys hunting-room which
looks north out of deference to aunt
carolines state of mind we forbore ref-
erence to it during the meal

  various as i suppose our views con-
cerning it were it exercised a fascination
upon us all and we were soon gathered
around it again

  i hope you will have her decently
buried as soon as possible richard said
aunt as after another long look at the
unworldly beauty of the occupant of the
crystal case she turned away shaking her
head sadly

  buried he echoed not until i am
sure that she is really dead

  aunts jaw fell

  richard she ejaculated youre not
-youre not going to-

  im going to take the means necessary
to be certain he replied firmly he knelt
down and began to inspect the casket

  count natali made a pretense of assist-
ing him-a pretense i say for it was
patent that he could not keep his eyes
from the woman

  aunt caroline seated herself on a divan
and gazed fixedly out the window her toes
keeping up a ceaseless tattoo on the floor

  moved by i do not know what impulse
carrie went to rickeys baby-grand in the
corner and began to strum mournfully in
a slow minor key i continued to stand by
the head of the casket

  air tight and perhaps soundproof

  said rickey at the end of ten minutes
heres some kind of a lever which seem
to-connect through to a sort of tank
arrangement inside and theres apparently
another lever inside here near her shoul-
der shall i chance it joe he laid a
hand on the outer lever

  the count nodded abstractedly though

i	am sure that he had not sensed the
question

  rickey pressed the lever his sleeve was
turned back and  saw the cords of his
forearm bulge under the skin the lever
yielded noiselessly for an inch or more

  there he said now lets see what
happens

  nothing apparently not immediately
we waited for i suppose five minutes
though it seemed fifteen rickey squatted
on his haunches count natali kneeling
and i standing

  i	cried out sharply i was first to see
it-the flutter of a pulse in the neck

  before i could point out my discovery
to the others the womans bosom heaved
softly and at once a tide of rich color
swept into her cheeks

  she was alive

chapter v

the visitor from the sky

carrie and aunt had come at my cry
we stared down at this miracle in
silence and with swirling senses then
rickey swore softly to himself and i think
we were all grateful to him even aunr

  she is not dead but sleeping mur-
mured aunt caroline

  im going to waken her said rickey

  with the handle of his pocket-knife he
struck upon the side of the casket near
the womans head the crystal rang like
a bell under the blow aunt started vio-
lently

  richard stop that instantly she
commanded really it did seem a fearful
thing to do but rickey struck three times

  mrs sanders who could not have been
far from the door thrust her gray head
through and asked if anything was wanted
the sky woman



  you may bring tea sanders replied
aunt caroline weakly mrs sanders cast
a horrified glance at the casket and with-
drew

  the crystal had not ceased to vibrate
under rickeys last blow when the woman
within stirred a change of expression
passed across her features and she opened
her eyes they were black as night when
i had thought that they would have been
blue

  for only an instant her face retained the
bewilderment of the newly-awakened then
the brain took command and she looked
up into count natalis face and smiled i
heard him catch his breath with a gasp
and he bent nearer the casket she seemed
to see only him of all of us and as if in
response to his involuntary movement her
hands crept up until they came in contact
with the crystal lid of her prison

  the feel of  it touched the spring of
memory she flashed a glance at the rest
of us and her ronderful eyes widened
groping at her shoulder with one hand
she pressed the lever which rickey had
discoverd there it released hidden springs
or else there was a pressure of gas within
the narrow chamber the lid rose swiftly
discovering that it was hinged at one side
and fell over on the heap of blankets

  a puff of cool choking atmosphere
struck me in the face i inhaled some of it
and it dizzied me i reeled back and took
hold of a chair for support

  the strange woman arose from her cush-
ioned rest and extending a hand to count
natali for his aid stepped out upon the
floor

  one glimpse of her face i had before
the catastrophe

  asleep she had been of supernal beauty
awake her black eyes flashing and her
cheeks aglow her face presented such a
combination of intellect and passion as i
have never seen or expect to see upon any
other mortal countenance fleshly or
painted queenly is too weak an adjective
to describe it but it is the only one ixan
think of

  for an instant t saw her so smiling as

count natali bowed low before her then
came a change a terrible change she had
taken a step forward her mouth was open
for speech when i saw her glorious eyes
go wide she swayed one hand clutching
at her bosom and the ripe color faded in
her cheeks

  whatever weakness had come upon her
i thought at the moment she had overcome
she moved on toward the north door with a
regal carriage still holding natalis hand
but she did not speak and her face was
like death

  at the doorway she paused and looked
down the sunlighted slopes of black bear
and up at the cloudless sky a supreme
triumph conquered the shadow of disaster
in her face half turning she let fall count
natalis fingers raised her white arms
above her head and cried in a voice like
a silver bell

  yee-mah yee-mahl alla ferma na
somme i

  it was her swan song before the echoes
of the marvelous voice had ceased to
thrill us she had collapsed choking into
the italians arms

  we ran toward them and helped him to
carry her to the divan but all we could
do was useless in three minutes she was
dead

  when that fact was sure we stood and
stared stupidly natali hung over her his
face like that of a carven statue the
statue of a red indian or a bedouin sheik
from the instant when she had smiled into
his eyes for him the rest of us had ceased
to exist

  our spell of sorrow and horror was
broken by mrs sanders who bustled in
with an armful of tea-things sized up the
situation and fainted in a terrific clatter

  i recall hearing carrie say i wish i
could do that i do really and then my
nerves would stand no more instead of
turning to and helping them resuscitate
mrs sanders i escaped to my room and
for more than an hour did battle with a
round of hysterics

  when i was once more presentable 
found that aunt caroline had retired with
a

famous fantastic mysteries

a headache-i suspect that it was another
name lor what had ailed me- id carrie
had gone out for a walk in the woods

  rickey and count natali were in the
hunting room my cousin sitting dejectedly
upon the divan and the count standing at
the north doorway and looking down the
mountainside the crystal casket had again
received its burden and the blankets were
over it

  well i suppose there is only one thing
to be done joe i heard rickey say as i
came down the stairs and that is to do as
the irishman said and call in the coroner
then we will bury her

  no i beg of you to let me dispose of
those arrangements interposed the count
earnestly without turning from his stand
i know that you will not gainsay me my
friend i will go down at once to the sta-
tion i have messages to dispatch he
stepped out without seeing me and a
couple of minutes later we heard him
leaving in one of rickeys cars

  rickey caught sight of me and jumped
up i suppose that i must have looked woe-
begone for he shook his head over me
and then managed to grin

  i say ruth old girl lets you and i go
out and walk it off he proposed

  at the edge of the clearing we met car-
rie coming in her eye-lids were swollen

rickey explained to me what he
thought had happened it was our
air which had killed the strange visitor
the atmosphere of earth must be of a
different quality from that at mars

  but i dont see how we could have
helped it he said she attempted a
splendid thing and failed i feel like cry-
ing like a baby every time i think of the
sheer pluck of her

  i did too it was as if a goddess had
died as carrie said afterward

  i saw the sky woman only once more
it was in the night that same night i
could sleep only in nervous cat-naps and
when i did i dreamed such fantasies that
it was a relief to wake from them finally
i gave it up and put on a dressing-gown

and sat at the window there was a white
moon and a silence and  thought and
thought

  at first my musings were disjointed and
silly evidenced by the persistent running
through my mind of two lines of a rather
vulgar old college ditty

sing ho for the great semiramis

her like we shall neer see again-

which came to me as such things some-
times will insist in our human brains upon
intruding themselves among the sacro-
sanct and the sublime

  truth to tell contemplation of the
events of the day gave me a touch of
vertigo the stupendous hardihood and
daring of the sky woman overawed me she
could not have known that she would find
human beings to release her nor had she
means to release herself yet she had
taken the thousandth chance and had her-
self flung out through the space toward
our world gambling her life with mag-
nificent recklessness

  had she missed her mark she might
have fallen through infinity and eternity
perhaps been sucked into the vortex of
some blazing sun to perish like a moth in
a candle-flame all these things she had
weighed and still her splendid spirit had
been undaunted

  surely this was the supreme test of
mortal courage confidence and fortitude
or it was fatalism to its nth power to die
is less than she had offered she had made
the cast and failed and before the sheer
splendor of her failure the most glorious
human achievements that i could think
of were dimmed columbus launching
himself westward across unknown waters
in his leaky caravels was a puny com-
parison

  and no glory had offered not as we
rate glory she could not have returned to
tell her people that she had succeeded

  an impulse grew strong upon me to go
down to the hunting-room i fought it
for i was afraid but it conquered and i
stole down the stairs to take another look
at the wondrous stranger how glad i
have always been that i did so
the sky woman



  the blankets had been thrown back from
the crystal case and the moonlight shone
in through a window and gleamed and
glittered frostily upon its translucent fab-
ric and upon the beauty now pallid and
awful of its occupant

  i paused upon the rug without the door-
way for the sky woman was not alone

  at the head of the casket sat or rather
crouched count natali his face was to-
ward me but he did not see me his eyes
were upon the dead one by one great
slow tears were trickling down his cheeks

  as i stood there almost afraid to
breathe rickey stepped in through the
outer door he too had been moved to
night-wandering from his bed it seemed
for he was in his bathrobe he saw count
natali and went to him and laid a hand
upon his shoulder

  come joe old man best go to bed
he said

  i cannot my friend natali answered
i must watch something has come to me
that is tearing my heart to shreds how
shall i say it i- his voice broke and
he pointed to the casket and covered his
face

  i think that i can understand joe
said rickey very gently i am sorry

  i crept back upstairs and to bed i too
understood i suppose that i ought to
have felt jealous and horrid but i didnt
i just felt very small and insignificant
and lost

  poor sky woman living or dead i
would not have fought you anyway i

couldnt have competed with a princes of
the blood royal of mars-and she must
have been all of that

  in the morning rickey took me for
another walk in the woods

  joe has asked me to tell you some-
thing little one he began facing me
squarely but speaking in a id-rather-
be-hung-than-do-it manner

  then you neednt i interrupted for
i know what it is i was at the door of the
hunting-room last night and i couldnt
help overhearing part of it and you
neednt be compassionate rickey moyer
for somehow i cant seem to cate as per-
haps i should-and im glad-

  maybe i leaned just the least bit to-
ward him he looked so big and strong and
leanable anyway his hand crept under
my chin i dont know what he saw in
my tilted face but next instant i was cry-
ing against his breast-pocket and he was
holding me comfortingly tight in his great
arms and telling me that he had cared
for me since we were small only somehow
joe seemed to have beat me to it

  so you see i have found compensa-
tion for what the sky woman cost me
rickey and i are to be married soon

  and the sky woman count natali had
her embalmed in some marvelous italian
fashion and took her back to italy with
him i often have a vision of him sitting
in a moonlighted hall of his old udolpho
castle with his dead but imperishable
bride while the slow tears glisten upon his
cheeks and fall upon her crystal casket

this old treatment often brings happy relief

  many sufferers relieve nagging backache
quickly once they discover that the real cause
of their trouble may be tired kidneys

  the kidneys are natures chief way of taking

the conquest of the
               moon poo

by a merritt
part iv

what happened before

  dr walter t goodwin set out to investi-
gate thoroughly an appalling phenomenon
this was the disappearance of dr david
throckmartins wife and associates in the
moon pool and disappearance later of
throckmartin himself on the way to the
island of nan-matal and the entrance to the
vast cavern in which was the moon pool
goodwin met captain olaf huldricksson
who said that a sparkling devil had come
down the path of the moon and taken his
wife and his little daughter freda with the
captain and larry okeefe of the royal air
force goodwin landed on nan-matal

  they passed the moon rock and were
imprisoned in the lair of the dweller of the
moon pool with a stranger dr von hetz-
dorp a german scientist a beautiful girl
accompanied by a huge frog-woman ap-
peared to them and by signs showed them
the secret springs that opened the wall be-
fore them

  at last they arrived in a vast country
miles below the surface where existed a race
of powerful dwarfs ruled over by a beauti-
ful woman yolara priestess of the shining
one and lugur the voice a man of
herculean strength yolara soon showed that
she was attracted by larry thereby arousing
the fury of lugur but larry having fallen
in love with the vision of the moon pool
chamber whom he had learned was lakla
handmaiden of the silent ones and as good
as yolara is evil did not respond

  the german and lugur joined forces
that the powerful influence of lakla and
the silent ones was on their side gave larry
and dr goodwin hope

  at a ceremony dedicated to the shining
one yolara declared her intention of taking

larry for her mate then and there the
ceremony was proceeding when lakla and
her frog-men warriors appeared

chapter xxiii

these the silent ones summon

through the grotesque ranks 
the frog-men lakla paced and halted
close beside me from firm little chin
to dainty buskined feet she was swathed
in the soft metallic robes these of a
dull almost coppery hue the left arm
was hidden the right free and gloved
the gloving disappearing high in the shoul-
der folds wound tight about the arm
was one of the vines of the sculptured
wall and of lugurs circled signet-ring
thick a vivid green its five tendrils ran
between her fingers stretching out five
flowered heads that gleamed like blossoms
cut from gigantic glowing rubies

  so she stood for a moment contemplat-
ing yolara from whose visage the mask
had fled leaving it is true a face still
seared with rage and hate but human
drawn perhaps by my gaze she dropped
her eyes upon me golden translucent
with tiny flecks of amber in their aureate
irises the soul that looked through them
was as far removed from that flaming
out of the priestesss as zenith is above
nadir

i noted the low broad brow the proud

dr goodwin feels the evil forces of muria closing relentlessly in on himself
and his friends what can he do to forestall the plot which will loose the
furies of inside earth upon the already anxious world above

swiftly the thing upreared more and more of it drawing into sight as the head of horror mounted
-until it stood above us like a scaled tower

little nose the tender mouth and the
soft-sunlight-glow that seemed to trans-
fuse the delicate skin and suddenly in
the eyes dawned a smile-sweet friendly
a touch of roguishness profoundly reas-
suring in its all humanness i felt my
heart expand as though freed from fetters
a recrudescence of confidence in the es-
sential reality of things as though in
nightmare the struggling consciousness
should glimpse some familiar face and
know the terrors with which it strove were
but dreams and involuntarily i smiled
back at her

  she raised her head and looked again



at yolara contempt and a certain cu-
riosity in her gaze at okeefe-and
through the softened eyes drifted swiftly
a shadow of sorrow and on its fleeting
wings deepest interest and hovering over
that a naive approval as reassuringly hu-
man as had been her smile she spoke
and her voice deep-timbered soft gold
as was yolaras all silver was subtly the
synthesis of all the golden glowing beauty
of her

  the silent ones have sent me o
yolara she said and this is their
command to you that ye delive to me
to bring before them three of the four
so

famous fantastic mysteries

strangers who have found their way here
this man they summon-she pointed to
okeefe-and this-her hand almost
touched me-and that yellow-haired one
who seeks his mate and babe-and how
knew she of olafs quest i wondered
but for him there who plots with lugur
-she pointed at von hetzdorp and i saw
yolara start-they have no need into
his heart the silent ones have looked
and lugur and you may keep him
yolara

  there was honeyed venom in the last
words and let me write here that truly
angelic as lakla might look and on oc-
casion be great as was her heart and high
her spirit she was very human indeed
feminine through and through and there-
fore not disdainful when they served her
either of womans guile or womans needle
tongue

  yolara was herself again now only
the edge of shrillness on her voice re-
vealed her wrath as she answered the
handmaiden

  and whence have the silent ones gained
power to command choya

  this last i knew was a very vulgar
word i had heard rador use it in a mo-
ment of anger to one of the serving
maids and it meant approximately
kitchen girl scullion beneath the in-
sult and the acid disdain the blood rushed
up under laklas ambered ivory skin her
hand clenched and i thought i saw writhe
the vine that braceleted her arm

  yolara-her voice was calm-of no
use it is to question me i am but the
messenger of the silent ones and one
thing only am i bidden to ask you-do
you deliver to me the three strangers

  lugur was on his feet eagerness sar-
donic delight sinister anticipation thrill-
ing from him and my same glance showed
von hetzdorp crouched biting his finger-
nails glaring at the golden girl

  no yolara fairly spat the word
no now by thanaroa and by the
shining one no her eyes blazed her
nostrils were wide in her fair throat a
little pulse beat angrily you lakla

take you my message to the silent ones
say to them that i keep this man-she
potffted to larry-because he is mine
say to them that i keep the yellow-
haired one and him-she pointed to me-
because it pleases me

  tell them that upon their mouths i
place my foot so she stamped upon the
dais viciously and that in their faces
i spit and her action was hideously
snakelike and say last to them you
handmaiden that if you they dare send
to yolara again she will feed you to the
shining one now-go

he handmaidens face was white
not unforeseen by the three was
this yolara she replied and did you
speak as you have spoken then i was
bidden to say this to you her voice
deepened three tal have ye to take
counsel yolara and at the end of that
time three things must ye have determined
either to do or not to do first send the
strangers to the silent ones second give
up ye and lugur and all of ye that
dream ye have of conquest of the world
without and third forswear the shining
one

  and if ye do not one and all these
things then are ye done your cup of life
broken your wine -of life spilled yea
yolara for ye and the shining one lugur
and the nine and all those here and their
kind shall pass this say the silent ones
surely shall all of ye pass and be as
though never had ye been

  now a gasp of rage and fear arose
from all those around me but the priestess
threw back her head and laughed loud
and long into the silver sweet chiming
of her laughter clashed that of lugur
and after a little the nobles took it up
till the whole chamber echoed with their
mirth okeefe lips tightening moved to-
ward the handmaiden and almost im-
perceptibly but peremptorily she waved
him back

  those are great words great words
indeed choya shrilled yolara at last
and again lakla winced beneath the word
the conquest of the moon pool



lo for lay a upon lay a the shining one
has been freed from the three and for
laya upon lay a they have sat helpless
rotting now i ask you again-whence
comes their power to lay their will upon
me and whence comes their strength to
wrestle with the shining one and the
beloved of the shining one

  and again she laughed and again lugur
and all th fair-haired joined in her
laughter

  into the eyes of lakla i saw creep
a doubt a wavering as though deep
within her the foundations of her own
belief were none too firm

  she hesitated turning upon okeefe
eyes in which rested more than sugges-
tion of appeal and yolara saw too
for she flashed with triumph stretched
a finger toward the handmaiden

  look she cried look why even
she does not believe her voice grew
silk of silver--merciless cruel now am
i minded to send another answer to the
silent ones yea but not by you lakla
by these she pointed to the frog-men
and swift as light her hand darted into
her bosom bringing forth the little shining
cone of death

  but before she could level it dart the
keth upon her the golden girl had re-
leased that hidden left arm and thrown
over her face a fold of the metallic swath-
ings swifter than yolara she raised the
arm that held the vine and now i knew
this was no inert blossoming thing it
was alive it writhed down her arm and
with its five rubescent flower heads thrust
itself out toward the priestess-vibrating
quivering held in leash only by the light
touch of the handmaiden at its very end

  from the swelling throat pouch of the
monster behind her carte a succession of
the reverberant boomings i had heard
when the little tendrils of moon flame be-
gan to shrink back to the crystal globes
the frog-men wheeled raised their lances
leveled them at the throng around the
reaching ruby flowers a red mist swiftiy
grew

  the silver cone dropped from yolaras
rigid fingers her eyes grew stark with
horror all her unearthly loveliness fled
from her she stood pale-lipped face
shrunken shorn of beauty by that one
gesture of laklas as samson was of his
strength by the first clip of delilahs
shears the handmaiden dropped the pro-
tecting veil and now it was she who
laughed

  it would seem then yolara that there
is a thing of the silent ones ye fear
she said well the kiss of the yekta i
promise you in return for the embrace
of your shining one

  she looked at larry long searchingly
and suddenly again with all that effect
of sunlight bursting into dark places her
smile shone upon him she nodded half
gaily looked down upon me again the
little merry light dancing in her eyes
waved her hand to me

  she spoke to the giant frog-man he
wheeled behind her as she turned facing
the priestess club upraised fangs glisten-
ing his troop moved not a jot spears
held high and lakla began to pass slowly
-almost i thought tauntingly-and as
she reached the portal larry leaped from
the dais

  alanna he cried youll not be leav-
in me just when ive found you

  in his excitement he spoke in his own
tongue the velvet brogue appealing lakla
turned and well it was that she did for
her gargantuan follower boomed a war-
note and swept the great mace over his
horned head whirling it downward as
the irishman rushed forward

  there was a sharp cry from the hand-
maiden and he halted the club not a
foot from okeefes black hair

  the irishman looked him up and down
stretched out his hand and patted the
scaled arm approvingly as one would a
dog

  good boy he said good boy but
i wouldnt harm a hair of her sweet head
for all the jewels in all the crowns the
kings of ireland ever wore let me by


famous fantastic mysteries

the monsters enormous eyes direct
on larry were unblinking but from
the huge throat came a puzzled croak
he turned toward the golden girl as
though expecting some order

  the handmaiden contemplated okeefe
hesitant unquestionably longingly ir-
resistibly she was like a child making
up her mind whether she dared or dared
not take a delectable something offered
her

  i go with you said okeefe this
time in her own speech a glimmer of
a smile passed through her eyes come
on doc he reached out a hand to
me

  but now yolara spoke life and beauty
had flowed back into her face and in
her purple eyes all her hosts of devils
were gathered

  do you forget what i promised you
before siya and siyana or what i prom-
ised you should you turn from me and
do you think that you can leave me-
me-as though i were a choya-like her
she pointed to lakla do you-

  now listen yolara larry interrupted
almost plaintively no promis- has
passed from me to you and why would
you hold me he passed unconsciously
into english be a good sport yolara
he urged you have got a very devil of
a temper you know and so have i
and wed be really awfully uncomfortable
together and why dont you get rid
of that devilish pet of yours and be
good 

  she looked at him puzzled von hetz-
dorp leaned over translated to lugur
the red dwarf smiled maliciously drew
near the priestess whispered to her what
was without doubt as near as he could
come in the murian to larrys own very
colloquial phrases

  yolara stiffened her lips writhed

  hear me lakla she cried her voice
vibrant with determination unshakable
now would i not let you take this man
from me were i to cuvell ten thousand
laya in the agony of the yektas kiss
this i swear to you by thanaroa by

my heart and by my strength that should
you try to take him or should he try
to go with you then shall i slay both
him and you with the keth and even
though the yekta you carry blast me
and may my strength wither my heart
rot in my breast and thanaroa forget
me if i do not this thing

  listen yolara- began okeefe again
be silent you it was almost a
shriek and her hand again sought in
her breast for the cone of death

  lugur touched her arm whispered again
the glint of guile shone in her eyes
she laughed softly relaxed

  the silent ones lakla bade you
say that they allowed me three tal to
decide she said suavely go now in
peace lakla and say that yolara has
heard and that for the three tal they-
allow-her she will take counsel

  the handmaiden hesitated a vague ap-
prehension a hint of doubt in her face

  the silent ones have said it she
answered at last stay you here
strangers the long lashes drooped as
her eyes met okeefes and a hint of
blush was in her cheeks stay you here
strangers till then but yolara see you
on that heart and strength you have sworn
by that they come to no harm else that
which you have invoked will come upon
you swiftly indeed and that  promise
you she added

  their eyes met clashed burned into
each other black flame from abaddon
and golden flame from paradise

  remember said lakla and passed
through the portal the gigantic frog-man
boomed a thunderous note of command
his grotesque guards turned and slowly
eyes menacing followed their mistress
and last of all passed out the monster
with the mace

chapter xxiv

larrys defiance

a clamor arose from all the cham-
ber stilled in an instant by a mo-
tion of yolaras hand she stood silent
the conquest of the moon pool



regarding okeefe with something other
now than the blind wrath of her threat
to him something half  regretful half
beseeching but the irishmans control
was gone

  yolara-his voice shook with rage
and he threw caution to the wind-now
hear me i go where i will and when i
will here shall we stay until the time
she named is come and then we follow
her whether you will or not and if any
should have thought to stop us tell them
of that flame that shattered the vase
he added grimly

  the wistfulness died out of her eyes
leaving them cold

  is it so she answered now it is
in my mind that much may happen ere
then perchance you and those others may
dance with the shining one or perchance
one of those hidden men that i showed
you may visit you or it may be that
i myself will slay ye and not so swiftly
larree

  and is that so he said slipping
back into english a promise means as
much to you as it does to the head of
von hetzdorps country and now the
breath of danger having blowni upon him
back came his old alert careless whimsical
self before that sweet little pet of
yours-he spoke now in her own tongue
-that you name the shining one dances
with us yolara many shall wither under
that swift flame i showed you and as
for you think whether you may not feel
it too before you have a chance to
slay and as for those hidden ones of
yours yolara know you that i have
anni-he used the murian for spirit the
polynesian ani-who will warn me long
long before they can don those robes that
hide them

  a sparkle came into his eyes lo
yolara even before you can command
them shall you hear the voice of my
spirit and it is this he threw back
his head and from his throat pulsed the
woe-laden sobbing cry raising steadily
into the heart-shaking shuddering wail
that i had heard on the deck of the

suwarna louder and ever louder it wailed
died away into the soul-broken sobbing
and faltered out into silence

  upon those listening sensitive as they
were to sound the effect of the high-
pitched keening was appalling it was
gruesome enough to me there was
startled movement a panic rush from
the tables to the portal even lugurs
face was gray the priestesss eyes stark
wide in von hetzdorps i saw ungrudg-
ing admiration

  and when you hear that yolara
thus okeefe know that my spirit is
near and think well before you send your
hidden ones or come yourself

  no answer made the priestess to him
she turned to the white-faced nobles
what lakla has said the council must
consider and at once said she now
friends of mine and friends of lugur
must all feud all rancor between us
end she glanced swiftly at lugur the
ladala-the common people-are stirring
and the silent ones threaten yet fear
not for are we not strong under the
shining one and now-leave us

  she waited until the last of the fair-
haired had withdrawn her hand dropped
to the table and she gave evidently a
signal for in marched a dozen or more
of the green dwarfs

  take these two to their place she
commanded pointing to us but wait-
she turned to the whispering globe touched
its control its light broke swam with
the film of rushing colors

  rador she spoke upon it the two
strangers come to you guard them and
the third named olaf as you would your
life and-listen well rador-if you do
not and if they should escape you then
before you die shall you beg me for
what shall seem to you laya upon laya
to throw you to the shining one -

the green dwarfs clustered about us
without another look at the priestess
okeefe marched beside me between
them from the chamber but glancing
round i saw pain writhe beneath the


famous fantastic mysteries

frozen anger on her face and in silence
she and lugur and the council and von
hetzdorp watched us as we passed through
the portals and it was not until we
had reached the pillared entrance that
larry spoke

  i hated to talk like that to a woman
doc he said and a pretty woman at
that but first she played me with a
marked deck and then not only pinched
all the chips but drew a gun on me
what the hell she nearly had me married
to her i dont know what the stuff was
she gave me but take it from me if
i had the recipe for that brew i could
sell it for a thousand dollars a jolt at
forty-second and broadway

  one jigger of it and you forget there
is a trouble in the world three of them
and you forget there is a world youll
admit doc that it wasnt the kind of
thing for a lady to pull on an unsuspect-
ing guest wont you hardly cricket
what no excuse for it doc and i dont
care what you say or what lakla may
say it wasnt my fault and i dont hold
it up against myself either

  i must admit that im a bit uneasy
about her threats i said ignoring all
this he stopped abruptly

  whatre you afraid of

  mostly i answered dryly i have
no desire to dance with the shining one
listen to me goodwin he took up
his walk impatiently cut the bated-
breath approach you use whenever you
talk about that bunch of animated fire-
works you scientific people are such
slaves to fact that when you meet a new
one that isnt in your own neat little
catalogue you either pass it by with the
haughty air or hold up your hands in
wonder and scream

  larry i cried a little dazed and
more than a little indignant

  olafs no better he said but i can
make allowances for him hes a sailor
no sir what this expedition needs is a
man without superstition and remember
this the leprechawn promised that id

have full warning before anything hap-
pened and if we do have to go out
well see that banshee bunch cleans up
before we do and pass in a blaze of glory
and dont forget it and hereafter-im
-in-charge 

  by this time we were before our
pavilion and neither of us in a very
amiable mood im afraid rador was
awaiting us and to my surprise cold
indeed was his greeting he took us from
our guard placed a whistle to his lips
and down the paths came a score of hi
own men

  let none pass in here without author-
ity and let none pass out unless i ac-
company them he ordered brusquely
summon one of the swiftest of the coria
and have it wait in readiness he added
as though by afterthought

  but when we had entered and the
screens were drawn together his manner
changed all eagerness he questioned us
briefly we told him of the happenings
at the feast of laklas dramatic inter-
ruption and of what had followed

  three tal he said musingly three
tal the silent ones have allowed-and
yolara agreed he sank back thoughtful

  a tal in muria is the equivalent of
thirty hours of earth surface time

  a it was olaf ja i told you the
shining devils mistress was all evil ja
now i begin again that tale i started
when he came he glanced toward the
preoccupied rador and tell him not
what i say should he ask for i trust
none here in trolldom save the jomjrau
-the white virgin

  after the oldster was adsprede-olaf
once more used that expressive norwegian
word for the dissolving of songar-i
knew that it was a time for cunning
craft i said to myself if they think i
have no ears to hear they will speak
and it may be i will find a way to save
my helma and dr goodwins friends
too ja and they did speak when i left
that place with the red devil and the
german they made many signs
the conquest of the moon pool



 the red trolde asked the german
how came it he was a worshipper of
thanaroa i could not resist a swift
glance of triumph toward okeefe and
the german rumbled olaf said that
all his people worshiped thanaroa and
now fought against the other nations that
denied him he said that his ruler be-
lieved his people the chosen of thanaroa
and because the other nations had defied
him his people had taken up arms ja
and lugur believed-for lugur he wor-
ships thanaroa more much more than
the shining devils ja

 and then we had come to lugurs
palace they put me in rooms and there
came to me men who rubbed and oiled
me and loosened my muscles the next
day i wrestled with a great dwarf they
called valdor he was a mighty man
and long we struggled and at last i broke
his back and lugur was pleased so
that i sat with him at feast and with
the german too and again not knowing
that i understood them they talked

  the german had gone fast and far
to longer was there talk of his ruler
but of lugur as head man of the germans
and von hetzdorp under him they spoke
of the green light that shook life from
the oldster and lugur said that the secret
of it had been the ancient ones and
that the council had not too much of
it but von hetzdorp said that among
his race were many wise men who could
make more once they had studied it

  then he spoke of the robes that pro-
tected from the shining devil lugur
told him of the priests who make them
and of the earth they dig that coats
them then said the german that his wise
men would make many for themselves in
case the shining devil should ever grow
too strong and that lugur and he and
his nation would give the shining devil all
the rest of the world to eat so that lugur
and he and all the germans should always
be mighty as he was when the shining
devil ate up those who cast themselves
into it

  and the next day i wrestled with
a great dwarf named tahola mightier
far than valdor him i threw after a
long long time and his back also i broke
again lugur was pleased saying that now
was i worthy to be slain by him and
again we sat at table he and the german
and i this time they spoke of some-
thing these trolde have which opens up
a svaelc-abysses into which all in its
range drops up into the sky

  what i exclaimed

  i know about them said larry
wait

 lugur had drunk much went on
olaf he was boastful the german
pressed him to show this thing after
a while the red one went out and came
back with a little golden box he and
the german went into the garden i fol-
lowed them there was a lille ho--a
mound-of stones in that garden on which
grew flowers and trees

  lugur pressed upon the box and a
spark no bigger than a sand grain leaped
out and fell beside the stones lugur
pressed again and a blue light shot from
the box and lighted on the spark the
spark that had been no bigger than a
grain of sand grew and grew as the blue
struck it and then there was a sighing
a wind rush and the stones and the
flowers and the trees were not they were
forsvinde-vanished

  then lugur who had been laughing
grew quickly sober for he thrust the
german back far back and soon down
into the garden came tumbling the stones
and the trees but broken and shattered
and falling as though from a great height
and lugur said that of this something
they had much for its making was a
secret handed down by their own fore-
fathers and not given them by the ancient
ones

  	they feared to use it he said for
a spark thrice as large as that he had
used would have sent all that garden

falling upward and miht have opened
a way to the outside before-he said just


famous fantastic mysteries

this-before we are ready to go out into
itt

  the german questioned much but
lugur sent for more drink and grew
merrier and threatened him and the ger-
man was silent through fear thereafter
i listened when i could and little more
i learned but that little enough ja
lugur is hot for conquest so yolara and
so the council they tire of it here and
the silent ones make their minds not
too easy no even though they jeer at
them and this they plan-to rule our
world with their shining devil that lugur
says has grown strong enough to fare
forth

  already they have tunneled upward
at that place they call the lower waters
and that i think is under ponape itself
there was to be their gathering-place to
sweep out upon the earth but now von
hetzdorp has told lugur of the passage
through which we came and lugur and
he now plan to open that

  the ladala they will almost utterly
destroy before they go except the soldiers
and the dream makers they talk of
sealing the silent ones within their
crimson sea but-and this is point of
trouble-they fear that if they do it
they may pull down all this place they
call muria those who speak against it
say- the silent ones can have no power
on earth never have they had it and it
may be that we shall not do well under
the sun perhaps we may wish to return
-and let the haven be open in case of
our need

  lugur would burn all bridges behind
him destroying all but not so yolara
and von hetzdorp would not because
he would keep what is here for germany
and in his heart too he laughs at the
silent ones and he schemes to-smadre-
smash all these people yet has he played
upon lugur by promising him that his
own people will cast aside their rulers
and will muster to lugur and that lugur
as a new ruler of germany and the shin-
ing devil as earth god shall rule all
the world for thanaroa and under his

whisperings lugur begins to forget ever
thanaroa 

  the norseman was silent for a mo-
ment then voice deep trembling-
trolldom is awake helvede crouches
at earth gate whining to be loosed into
a world already devil ridden and we
are but three

chapter xxv

the councils decision

felt the blood drive out of my
heart but larrys was the fighting
face-of the okeefes of a thousand
years rador glanced at him arose stepped
through the curtains returned swiftly
with the irishmans uniform

  put it on he said brusquely agair
fell back into his silence and whatevei
okeefe had been about to say was sub-
merged in his wild and joyful whoop he
ripped from him glittering tunic and leg
swath in gs

  richard is himself again he shouted
and each garment as he donned it fanned
his old devil-may-care confidence to a
higher flame the last scrap of it on he
drew himself up before us

  bow down ye divils he cried bang
your heads on the floor and do homage
to larry the first emperor of great
britain autocrat of all ireland scotland
england and wales and adjacent waters
and islands kneel ye scuts kneel
larry  cried are you going crazy
not a bit of it he said im that
and more if herr von hetzdorp keeps
his promise whoop bring forth the royal
jewels an put a whole new bunch of
golden strings in taras harp an down
with the sassenach forever whoop

  he did a wild jig

  lord how good the old togs feel he
grinned the touch of em has gone to
my head but its straight stuff im tell-
ing you about my empire

  he laughed again then sobered

  not that its not serious enough at
that a lot that olafs told us ive sur-
mised from hints dropped by yolara but
the conquest of the moon pool



i got the full key to it from the von
himself when he stopped me just before
-before-he reddened-well before i
acquired that brand-new brand of souse
do you remember goodwin away back
in the moon pool chamber that the ger-
man made a very curious remark about
being certain that i always spoke what
was in my mind and that hed remember
it

  funny funny psychology-the german
he made a picture of me in his mind
a somewhat innocent frank truthful and
impulsive larry okeefe always saying
right out just what i thought and with
no subterfuge or guile about me thats
the picture he carried in his neat german
mind-and by the shade of genseric the
vandal let me be any different if i dared

  maybe he hada hint-maybe he just
surmised-that  knew a lot more than
i did and he thought yolara and i
were going to be loving little turtle doves
also he figured that yolara had a lot
more influence with the unholy fireworks
than lugur also she could be more easily
handled all this being so what was
the logical thing for him to do sure you
get me fella throw down lugur and
make an alliance with me so he calmly
offered to ditch the red dwarf if i would
deliver yolara my reward was to be said
emperorship can you beat it good
lord

  he went off into a perfect storm of
laughter but not to me did this thing
seem at all absurd rather in it i sensed
the dawn of catastrophe colossal

  but how would they get to germany
-how carry the shining one-

  oh thats all worked out answered
larry airily theres a german war-
ship hiding down there in the carolines
somewhere the von knows where it is
also he has a nice little wireless rigged
up on one of the nan-matal islets with
that boat equipped with the keth- he
confided to me that they had apparatus
that could sweep it over a fifty-mile
range and a few of those gravity-destroy-
ing bombs olaf described-

  gravity-destroying bombs i gasped

  sure the little fairy that sent the
trees and stones kiting up-von hetzdorp
licked his lips over them what they do
is to cut off gravity just about as the
shadow screens  cut off light and con-
sequently whatevers in their range just
naturally goes shooting up toward the
moon he sobered i admit im a bit
scared about them doc anyway with
those two things and-oh yes gentle in-
visible soldiers walking around assassinat-
ing all the leaders of the rest of the
world-well bingo for all the rest of our
world goodwin

  and take it from me old chap its not
a dream weve got to beat von hetzdorp
and all the rest of em to it goodwin
he ended solemnly enough

  but the shining one i began

  yolaras to nurse the sweet little
thing he said itll follow her like a
lamb von hetzdorp says and theres
something about that i dont understand

  something i dont understand a bit of
it i interrupted almost testily

  no he grinned i dont mean what
it is i mean how its controlled oh
well ill bet lakla knows all about it
and ill bet well soon be hearing her tell
us he ended grimly

  but larry i exclaimed stupidly
enough i confess you shook hands with
von hetzdorp on it

  oh the ingenuous the unsuspecting
childlike mind of science he intoned
piously old dear arent you spoofing
me why doc just as id make love to
hecate at the gates of hades if it would
find me the way to the golden girl id
kiss-yes actually kiss-von hetzdorp if
it would give me one more minute to
block a game like this its bad medicine
for our world doc whichever way you
look at it and as olaf says theres only
three of us

  not that i mind fireworks he con-
cluded if i had fireworks outside i
could finish-it-with one splash of a
down-town new york high-pressure fire
hose but the other stuff-are the goods


famous fantastic mysteries

for once larrys courage his un-
quenchable confidence found no echo
within me not lightly as he did i hold
that dread mystery the dweller and a
vision passed before me a vision of an
apocalypse undreamed by the evangelist

  a vision of the shining one swirling
into our world a monstrous glorious flam-
ing pillar of incarnate eternal evil of
peoples passing through its radiant em-
brace into that hideous unearthly life-
in-death which i had seen enfold the
sacrifices of armies trembling into danc-
ing atoms of diamond dust beneath the
green rays rhythmic death of cities rush-
ing out into space upon the wings of that
other demoniac force which olaf had
watched at work of a haunted world
through which the assassins of the dwellers
court stole invisible carrying with them
the very passion of hell of the rallying
to the thing of every sinister soul and of
the weak and the unbalanced mystics and
carnivores of humanity alike for well
i knew that once loosed not even ger-
many could hold this devil-god for long
and that swiftly its blight would spread

  and then a world that was all colossal
reek of cruelty and terror a welter of
lusts of hatreds and of torment a chaos
of horror in which the dweller waxing
ever stronger the ghastly hordes of those
it had consumed growing ever greater
wreaked its inhuman will

  at the last a ruined planet a cosmic
plague spinning through the shuddering
heavens its verdant plains its murmur-
ing forests its meadows and its mountains
manned only by a countless crew of soul-
less mindless dead-alive their shells il-
lumined with the dwellers infernal glory
and flaming over this vampirized world
like a flare from some hell far infinitely
far beyond the reach of mans farthest
flung imagining-the dweller

  panic gripped my throat strangled me
my science could not help what god or
gods could olaf had turned to ancient
thor and odin okeefes faith was - in
banshees

  rador jumped to his feet smiled ami-
ably ai us walked to the whispering globe
he bent over its base did something with
its mechanism beckoned to us the globe
swam rapidly faster than ever i had
seen it before a low humming arose
changed into a murmur and then from it
i heard lugurs voice clearly

  it is to be war then

  there was a chorus of assent-from a
council i thought

  i will take the tall one named larree
it was the priestesss voice after the
three tal you may have him lugur to do
with as you will

  no it was lugurs voice again but
with a rasp of anger all three must
die

  he shall die again yolara but i
would that first he should see lakla die
and that she know what is to happen to
him

  no i started-for this was von
hetzdorp now is no time yolara for
ones own desires this is my council at
the end of the three tal lakla will come
for our answer your men will be in am-
bush and they will slay her and her escort
quickly with the keth but not till that
is done must the three be slain and then
quickly with lakla dead we shall go
forth to the silent ones-and i promise
you that i will find the way to destroy
them 

  it is well it was lugur

  it is well yolara it was a womans
voice and i knew it for that old one of
ravaged beauty cast from your mind
whatever is in it for this stranger either
of love of hatred in this the council is
with lugur and the man of wisdom

there was a silence then came the
priestesss voice sullen but-beaten

  it is well

  let the three be taken now by rador
to the temple and given to the high priest
sator thus lugur until what we have
planned comes to pass

  rador gripped the base of the globe
the conquest of the moon pool



abruptly it ceased its spinning he turned
to us as though to speak and even as he
did so its bell note sounded peremptorily
and on it the color films began to creep at
their accustomed pace

  i hear the green dwarf whispered
but now we could no longer distinugish the
words he listened

  they shall be taken there at once he
said at last gravely the globe grew
silent

  he stepped toward us larry had drawn
his automatic olaf and i followed his
exarrtple we faced the green dwarf de-
fiantly

  you have heard he said smiling
faintly

  not on your life rador said larry
nothing doing  and then in the murians
own tongue we follow lakla rador
and you lead the way he thrust the
pistol close to the green dwarfs side

 rador did not move but his eyes
gleamed their approval as they looked up
into the irishmans determined ones

  of what use larree he said quietly
me you can slay but in the end you will
be taken life is not held so dear in
muria that my men out there or those
others who can come quickly will let you
by even though you slay many and in
the end they will overpower you

  there was a trace of irresolution in
okeefes face

  and said rador if i let you go i
dance with the shining one-or worse

  okeefes pistol hand dropped

  youre a good sport rador and far be
it from me to get you in bad he said
take us to the temple when we get
there-well your responsibility ends
doesnt it

  the green dwarf nodded on his face
a curious expression was it relief or
was it profound emotion higher than this

  whatever it was he turned curtly

  follow he said we passed out of that
gay little pavilion that had come to be
home to us even in this alien placethe
guards stood at attention

  you sattoya stand by the globe he
ordered one of them should the afyo
maie ask say that i am on my way with
the strangers even as she has commanded

  we passed through the lines to the
corial standing like a great shell at the
end of the runway leading into the green
road

  wait you here he said curtly to the
driver the green dwarf ascended to his
seat sought the lever and we swept on-
on and out upon the glistening obsidian

  then rador turned and laughed

  larree he cried i love you for that
spirit of yours and did you think that
rador would carry to the temple prison
a man who would take the chances of
death upon his own shoulders to save
him or you goodwin who saved him
from the rotting death for what did i
take the corial or lift the veil of silence
that i might hear what threatened you-

  laughing again into our amazed faces
he swept the corial to the left away from
the temple approach

  i am done wdth lugur and with yo-
lara and the shining one cried rador
my hand is for you three and for lakla
and those to whom she is handmaiden

  the shell leaped forward seemed to

fly-

  whence go we rador i gasped in
his ear

  straight to that bridge that guards the
way to the crimson sea he shouted
and pray whatever gods you worship
that we pass it before ever yolara finds
whence our way has led

chapter xxvi

the casting of the shadow

now we were flying down toward that
last span whose ancientness had set
it apart from all the other soaring arches
the shells speed slackened we approached
warily

  we pass there asked okeefe

  the green dwarf nodded pointing to
the right where the bridge ended in a


famous fantastic mysteries

broad platform held high upon two gi-
gantic piers between which ran a spur
from the glistening road platform and
bridge were swarming with men-at-arms
they crowded the parapets looking down
upon us curiously but with no evidence
of hostility rador drew a deep breath
of relief

  we dont have to break our way
through then there was disappointment
in the irishmans voice

  no use larree smiling rador
stopped the corial just beneath the arch
and beside one of the piers now listen
well they have had no warning hence
does yolara still think us on the way to
the temple this is the gateway of the
portal and the gateway is closed by the
shadow once i commanded here and i
know its laws this must i do-by craft
persuade serku the keeper of the gateway
to lift the shadow or raise it myself and
that will be hard and it may well be that
in the struggle life will be stripped of us
all yet is it better to die fighting than
to dance with the shining one

  ja it was olaf eyes again ice glinting
as he clutched one of radors broad shoul-
ders ja well it is to die fighting-but
i would slay lugur before i die

  and so you may strong one laughed
the green dwarf for here lugur will sure-
ly come when the alarm is given and they
will try to save us for a slower death
and now see to those flame tubes of
yours and follow my lead for too long
have we waited here

  he swept the shell around the pier
opened a wide plaza paved with the
volcanic glass but black as that down
which we had sped from the chamber of
the moon pool it shone like a mirrored
lakelet of jet on each side of it arose
what at first glance seemed towering bul-
warks of the same ebon obsidian at sec-
ond revealed themselves as structures
hewn and set in place by men polished
faces pierced by dozens of high narrow
windows each ovaled with exquisite in-
taglios of feathered serpent and the flower
snake that lakla had called the yekta

and with whose kiss she had threatened
yolara

  down each facade a stairway fell broken
by small landings on which a door opened
they dropped to a broad ledge of grayish
stone edging the lip of this midnight pool
and upon it also fell two wide flights from
either side of the bridge platform along
all four stairways the guards were ranged
and here and there against the ledge
stood the shells in a curiously comforting
resemblance to parked motors in our own
world

  the somber walls bulked high curved
and ended in two obelisked pillars from
these like a tremendous curtain stretched
a barrier of that tenebrous gloom which
though weightless as shadow itself i now
knew to be as impenetrable as the veil
between life and death in this murk un-
like all others i had seen i sensed move-
ment a quivering a tremor constant and
rhythmic not to be seen yet caught by
some subtle sense as though through it
beat a swift pulse of-black light

  in the center of the pit of glittering
darkness poised over the depths that were
like some frozen spring upwelling from
inky styx itself we hung for a moment
watching

  the green dwarf turned the corial slow-
ly to the edge at the right crept cautious-
ly on toward where not more than a hun-
dred feet from the barrier a low wide
entrance opened in the fort guarding its
threshold stood two guards armed with
broadswords double handed terminating
in a wide lunette mouthed with murder-
ous fangs these they raised in salute and
through the portal strode a dwarf huge as
rador dressed as he and carrying only
the poniard that was the badge of office
of murias captainry

  ho rador he hailed merrily why
hover without when within are cheer and
welcome

  the green dwarf swept the shell ex-
pertly against the ledge leaped out

  greeting serku he answered i was
but looking for the coria of lakla

  lakla exclaimed serku why the
the conquest of the moon pool



handmaiden passed with her akka nigh a
va ago

 passed the astonishment of the
green dwarf was so real that half was i
myself deceived you let her pass

  certainly i let her pass but under
the green dwarfs stern gaze the truculence
of the guardian faded why should i
not he asked apprehensively

  because yolara commanded otherwise
answered rador coldly

  there came no command to me little
beads of sweat stood out on serkus fore-
head else would i surely have obeyed-

  serku interrupted the green dwarf
swiftly truly is my heart wrung for you
this is a matter of yolara and of lugur
and the council yes even of the shining
one and the message was sent and the
fate mayhap of all muria rested upon
your obedience and the return of lakla
with these strangers to the council now
truly is my heart wrung for there are few
i would less like to see dance with the
shining one than you serku he ended
softly

livid now was the gateways guard-
ian his great frame shaking

  come with me and speak to yolara
he pleaded there came no message tell
her-

  wait serku there was a thrill as of
inspiration in radors voice this corial
is of the swiftest-laklas of the slowest
with lakla scarce a va ahead we can
reach her before she enters the portal
lift you the shadow we shall bring her
back and this will i do for you serku

  doubt tempered serkus panic

  why not go alone rador leaving the
strangers here with me he asked and
i thought not unreasonably

  nay then the green dwarf was brusque
lakla will not return unless i carry to
her these men as evidence of our good
faith there is strife brewing serku bat-
tle between muria and the silent ones
nor have i time to explain more with
lakla now a va away come we will speak
to yolara and she shall judge you he

started away but serku caught his arm

  no rador no he whispered again
panic-stricken go you as you will but
bring her back speed rador he sprang
toward the entrance i lift the shadow-

  into the green dwarfs poise crept a
curious almost a listening alertness he
leaped to serkus side

  i go with you i heard some little
i can tell you they were gone

  fine work muttered larry nom-
inated for a citizen of ireland when we
get out of this one rador of-

  the shadow trembled shuddered into
nothingness the obelisked outposts that
had held it framed a ribbon of roadway
high banked with verdure vanished in
green distances

  and then from the portal sped a shriek
a death cry it cut through the silence of
the ebon pit like a whimpering arrow be-
fore it had died down the stairways came
pouring the guards those at the threshold
raised their swords and peered within
abruptly rador was between them one
dropped his hilt and gripped him the
green dwarfs poinard flashed and was
buried in his throat down upon radors
head swept the second blade

  a flame leaped from okeefes hand
and the sword seemd to fling itself from
its wielders grasp-another flash and the
soldier crumpled rador threw himself
into the shell darted to the high seat and
straight between the pillars of the shadow
we flew

  there came a crackling a shadow as of
vast wings flinging down upon us the
corials flight was checked as by a giants
hand i was hurled forward into olaf and
okeefe tumbled beneath the front whorl
the shell swerved sickeningly there was
an oddly metallic splintering it quivered
shot ahead dizzily i picked myself up
and looked behind

  the shadow had fallen-but too late a
bare instant too late and shrinking as we
fled from it still it seemed to strain like
some fettered afrit from eblis throbbing
with wrath seeking with every malign
power it possessed to break its bonds and

pursue not until long after were we to
know that it had been the dying hand of
serku groping out of oblivion that had
cast it after us as a fowler upon an escap-
ing bird

  snappy work rador it was larry
speaking but they cut the end off your
bus all right

  i glanced back a full quarter of the
hindward whorl was gone sliced off clean-
ly rador noted it with anxious eyes

  that is bad he said but not too
bad perhaps we cannot tell yet all de-
pends upon how closely lugur and his men
can follow us

he raised a hand to okeefe in salute
but to you larree i owe my life
not even the keth could have been as
swift to save me as was that death flame
of yours friend

  the irishman waved an airy hand re-
lapsing into his own tongue

  youre doing your bit yourself old
thing he remarked rador caught the
meaning fluke larry murmured to
me aimed at the beggars head and
went high reputation maker-the shot
you never meant what happened he
turned again to rador

  serku-the green dwarf drew from
his girdle the blood-stained poniard-
serku i was forced to slay even as he
raised the shadow the globe gave the
alarm lugur follows with twice ten times
ten of his best serku drew his blade upon
me and i killed- he hesitated though
we have escaped the shadow it has taken
toll of our swiftness may we reach the
portal before it closes upon lakla but
if we do not- he paused again well
i know a way but it is not one i am
gay to follow no

  he snapped open the aperture that held
the ball flaming within the dark crystal
peered at it anxiously i crept to the torn
end of the corial how i wondered could
the shadow have first held when shorn
with such unbelievable energy the edges
were crumbling disintegrated they
powtdered in my fingers like dust mysti-
fied still i crept back where larry sheer

happiness pouring from him was whistling
softly and polishing up his automatic his
gaze tell upon olafs grim sad face and
softened

  buck up olaf he said weve got
a good fighting chance once we link up
with lakla and her crowd im betting that
we get your wife never doubt it the
baby- he hesitated awkwardly the
norsemans eyes filled he stretched a
hand to the okeefe

  the yndling-she is of de dode he
half whispered of the blessed dead for
her i have no fear and for her vengeance
will be given me jabut mine hustru
my helma-she is of the dead-alive-like
those we saw whirling like leaves in the
light of the shining devil and i would
that she too were of de dode and at
rest i do not know how to fight the shin-
ing devil-no

  his hearts bitter despair welled up in
his voice

laf larrys voice was gentle
well come out on top i know it
and i hope and i do believe olaf that
well get your wife out of it all right but
theres one thing you must remember all
this stuff that seems so strange and-and
well sort of supernatural is just a lot of
tricks were not hep to as yet dont fall
for it olaf thats what theyre hoping
well do they want to get our nerve

  what you call the shining devil isnt
any devil or spook or anything of the
kind its just something were not used
to

  the norseman considered this nodded
gravely

  ja he answered at last at least we
can fight that is why i have turned to
thor of the battles ja and one have i
hope in for mine helma-the white
maiden since i have turned to the old
gods it has been made clear to me that
i shall slay lugur tand that the heks the
evil witch yolara shall also die but i
would talk with the white maiden

  all right said larry but just dont
be afraid of what you dont understand
the conquest of the moon pool



olaf i could lie on my back in a field
in ireland and dream in an hour more
things of this sort than these people could
show us in a million years theres another
thing-he hesitated nervously-theres
another thing that may startle you a bit
when we meet up with lakla-her-er-
frogs 

  like the frog woman we saw on the
wall asked olaf

  yes went on larry rapidly its
this way-i figure that the frogs grow
rather large where she lives and theyre
a bit different too well laklas got a
lot of em trained carry spears and clubs
and all that junk just like trained seals
or monkeys or so on in the circus prob-
ably a custom of the place

  nothing queer about that olaf why
hell people have all kinds of pets-arma-
dillos and snakes and rabbits kangaroos
and elephants and tigers look what you
can do with chimpanzees-make em al-
most human even teach em to smoke
and drink lakla was probably up against
it for help and specialized in frogs prob-
ably an extraordinary intelligent frog
thats all there is to it

  remembering how the frog-woman had
stuck in larrys mind from the outset i
wondered whether all this was not more
to convince himself than olaf

  but i listened no more for now i was
sure of my surmise i busied myself tak-
ing note of the rapidly changing aspect
of the country through which we were
running the road had begun to thrust
itself through high flung sharply pinnacled
masses and rounded out-croppings of rock
on which clung patches of the amber moss

  the trees had utterly vanished and
studding the moss-carpeted plains were
only clumps of a willowy shrub from which
hung like grapes clusters of white waxen
blooms the light too had changed gone
were the dancing sparkling atoms and
the silver had faded to a soft almost
ashen grayness ahead of us marched a
rampart of coppery cliffs rising like-all
these mountainous walls we had seen into
the immensities of haze

  something long drifting in my subcon-
sciousness turned to startled realization
the speed of the shell was slackening
the aperture containing the ionizing
mechanism was still open i glanced within
the whirling ball of fire was not dimmed
but its coruscations instead of pouring
down through the cylinder swirled and
eddied and shot back as though trying
to re-enter their source rador nodded
grimly

  the shadow takes its toll he said

  we topped a rise larry gripped my arm

  look he cried and pointed far far
behind us so far that the road was but
a glistening thread a score of shining
points came speeding

  lugur and his men said rador

  cant you step on her asked larry

  step on her repeated the green dwarf
puzzled

  give her more speed push her ex-
plained okeefe

  rador looked about him the coppery
ramparts were close not more than five
of our miles distant in front of us the
plain lifted in a long rolling swell and up
this the corial essayed to go with a terrify-
ing lessening of speed faintly behind us
came shoutings and we knew that lugur
drew close nor anywhere was there sign
of lakla nor her frog-men-the akka

now we were half-way to the crest
the shell barely crawled and from
beneath it came a faint hissing it quivered
and i knew that its base was no longer
held above the glassy surface but rested
on it

  one last chance exclaimed rador he
pressed upon the control lever and
wrenched it from its socket instantly the
sparkling ball expanded whirling with
prodigious rapidity and sending a cascade
of coruscations into the cylinder the shell
rose leaped through the air the dark
crystal split into fragments the fiery ball
dulled died but upon the impetus of
that last thrust we reached the crest
poised there for a moment i caught a
glimpse of the foad dropping down the
 

famous fantastic mysteries

side of an enormous moss-covered bowl-
shaped valley whose sharply curved sides
ended abruptly at the base of the towering
barrier

  then down the steep hissing over the
obsidian powerless to guide or to check
the shell we plunged in a meteor rush
straight for the annihilating adamantine
breasts of the cliffs

  now the quick thinking of larrys air
training came to our aid as the rampart
reared close to us he threw himself upon
rador hurled him and himself against the
side of the flying whorl under the shock
the finely balanced machine almost floating
in air through its projectile speed swerved
from its course it struck the soft low
bank of the road shot high in air bounded
on through the thick carpeting whirled
like a dervish and fell upon its side shot
from it we rolled for yards but the moss
saved broken bones or serious bruises

  quick cried the green dwarf he
seized an arm dragged me to my feet
began running to the cliff base not a
hundred feet away beside us raced
okeefe and olaf at our left was the black
road it stopped abruptly was cut off by
a slab of polished crimson stone a hundred
feet high and as wide set within the
coppery face of the barrier on each side
of it stood pillars cut from the living
rock and immense almost as those which
held the rainbow veil of the dweller
across its face weaved unnameable carv-
ings but i had no time for more than
a glance the green dwarf gripped my
arm again

  quick he cried again the hand-
maiden has passed

  at the right of the portal ran a low
wall of shattered rock over this we raced
like rabbits hidden behind it was a nar-
row path crouching rador in the lead we
sped along it three hundred four hundred
yards we raced-and the path ended in
a cul de sac i to our ears was borne a
louder shouting okeefe peered over the
wall

  here they come he announced

  the first of the pursuing shells had

swept over the lip of the great bowl
poised for a moment as we had and then
and as we had began a cautious
descent within it scanning the slopes
i saw lugur

  a little closer and ill get him
whispered larry viciously he raised his
pistol

  his hand was caught in a mighty grip
rador eyes blazing stood beside him

  no rasped the green dwarf he
heaved a shoulder against one of the
boulders that formed the pocket it rocked
aside revealing a slit of an entrance

  in ordered he straining against the
weight of the stone okeefe weapon in
hand slipped through olaf at his back
i following with a lightning leap the
green dwarf was beside me the huge rock
missing him by a hairbreadth as it swung
into place

  we were in cimmerian darkness i felt
for my pocket-flash and recalled jvith
distress that i had left-it behind with my
medicine kit when we fled from the
gardens but rador seemed to need no
light

  grip hands he ordered a palm shot
into mine

  its me professor laughed okeefe
a great paw touched my side fell into
my other hand and i knew this for olafs
we crept single file holding to each other
like children through the black at last
the green dwarf paused

  await me here he whispered do
not move and for your lives-be silent

  and be was gone

chapter xxvii

dragon worm and moss death

for a small eternity-to me at least-
we waited then as silent as ever
the green dwarf returned

  it is well he said some of the strain
gone from his voice grip hands again
and follow

  wait a bit rador this was larry
if lugurs going to follow us in here
why not let olaf and me go back to the
the conquest of the moon pool



opening and pick them off as they come
in we could hold the lot and in the
meantime you and goodwin could go after
lakla for help

  lugur knows the secret of the portal
if he dares use it answered the captain
with a curious indirection and now that
they have challenged the silent ones i
think he will dare also he will find our
tracks and it may be that he knows this
hidden way

  well for heavens sake okeefes
appalled bewilderment was almost lu-
dicrous if he knows all that and you
knew all that why didnt you let me click
him when i had the chance

  larree the green dwarf was grave
and oddly humble it seemed good to me
too-at first and then i heard a command
heard it clearly to stop you-that lugur
die not now lest a greater vengeance fail 
command from whom the irish-
mans voice distilled out of the blackness
the very essence of bewilderment

  i thought rador was whispering
that it came from the silent ones
superstition groaned okeefe in utter
exasperation always superstition what
can you do against it

  never mind rador his sense of
humor came to his aid its too late now
anyway where do we go from here old
dear he laughed

  we tread the path of one i am not
fain to meet answered rador but if
meet we must point the death tubes at
the pale shield he bears upon his throat
and send the flame into the flower of cold
fire that is its center-nor look into his
eyes 

  again larry gasped and i with him
its getting too deep for me doc he
muttered dejectedly can you make head-
or tail of it

  no i answered shortly enough but
rador fears something and thats his de-
scription of it

  sure he replied only its a code
i dont understand i could feel his grin
all right for the flower of cold fire rador
and i wont look into his eyes hftwent

on cheerfully but hadnt we better be
moving

  come said the soldier again hand
in hand we went blindly on

  okeefe was muttering to himself

  flower of cold fire dont look into
his eyes some joint a lot of supersti-
tion then he caroled softly

  oh mama pin a cold rose  me

  two young frogmen are in love with me

  shut my eyes so i cant see

  sh rador was warning he began
whispering lugur for a little time will
be perplexed he will not open the portal
until he must they will find the corial
and search they will follow our tracks
beyond the moving stone is naught but
bare rock there will be no tracks there
but neither will there be hiding place
they will seek the entrance and they will
find it then lugur will send after us
there a force of his men and with his
others will pass through the portal to beat
for us

  for half a va we go along a way of
death from its peril we pass into another
against whose dangers i can guard you
but in parts this is in view of the road-
way and it may be that lugur will see us
if so we must fight as best we can if
we pass these two roads safely then is
the way to the crimson sea clear nor need
we fear lugur nor any and there is
another thing that lugur does not know
when he opens the portal the silent ones
will hear and lakla and the akka will be
swift to greet its opener

  rador i asked how know you all
this

  the handmaiden is my own sisters
child he answered quietly

  okeefe drew a long breath

  uncle he remarked casually in eng-
lish meet the man whos going to be
your nephew and thereafter except in
grave moments he never addressed the
green dwarf except by the avuncular title
which rador humorously enough ap-
parently conceived to be one of respectful
endearment


famous fantastic mysteries

  for me a light broke plain now was
the reason for his fore-knowledge of lak-
las appearance at the feast where larry
had so narrowly escaped yolaras spells
plain indeed the determining factor that
had cast his lot with ours and my con-
fidence despite his discourse of mysterious
perils experienced a remarkable quicken-
ing

  speculation as to the marked differ-
ences in pigmentation and appearance of
niece and uncle was dissipated by my con-
sciousness that we were now moving in
a dim half light

  we were in a fairly wide tunnel not
far ahead the gleam filtered pale yellow
like sunlight sifting through the leaves
of autumn poplars and as we drew closer
to its source i saw that it did indeed pass
through a leafy screen hanging over the
passage end this rador drew aside cau-
tiously beckoned us and we stepped
through

  at first thought it appeared to be a
tunnel cut through soft green mold its
base was a flat strip of pathway a yard
wide from which the walls curved out in
perfect cylindrical form smoothed and
evened with utmost nicety thirty feet
wide they were at their widest then drew
toward each other with no break in their
symmetry they did not close above was
roughly a ten-foot rift ragged edged
through which poured light like that in the
heart of pale amber a buttercup light
shot through with curiously evanescent
bronze shadows

  under the feet the path gave with a
resiliency like hard rubber or well-rolled
turf

  it was ridged-rippled-these ripples
a foot apart and flanked by deep sharp
indentations clean cut as though drilled
just such a tunnel it came to me as would
be made by a huge metal ball belted with
a long toothed strip and sent rolling with
terrific force through some compressible
material such as for instance some types
of moss

  quick commanded rador uneasily
and set off at a sharp pace

moss why had that image come to
me ah so that was why for now
my eyes becoming more accustomed to
the-strange light i saw that the tunnels
walls were of moss

  hurry it was rador calling i had
lagged behind and reluctantly i turned my
mind from those tempting walls luring
me to stop and study them whose spell
indeed already had slowed my pace
hurriedly i rejoined the others resolutely
i kept my eyes at my feet maintaining my
place in the file

  and down the corridor swept ever tiny
gusts overladen with unfamiliar oddly
fragrant odors some so pronounced as to
produce a trifle of light-headedness al-
most as though surcharged with oxygen

  rador quickened the pace to a half-run
we were climbing panting the tunnel was
no longer straight it was-sinuous dis-
possessing the picture of the rolling ball
came another of a long flexible cylinder
being forced through the luxuriant growth
the amber light grew stronger the rift
above us wider the tunnel curved on
the left a narrow cleft appeared the green
dwarf leaped toward it thrust us within
pushed us ahead of him up a steep rocky
fissure-well nigh indeed a chimney up
and up this we scrambled until my lungs
were bursting and i thought i could climb
no more the crevice ended we crawled
out and sank even rador upon a little
leaf-carpeted clearing circled by lacy
tree-ferns

  gasping legs aching we lay prone re-
laxed drawing back strength and breath
rador was first to rise thrice he bent
low as in homage then-

  give thinks to the ancient ones for
their power has been over us he ex-
claimed

  dimly i wondered what he meant
something about the fern leaf at which
i had been staring aroused me i leaped
to my feet and ran to its base this was
no fern no it was fern moss the largest
of its species i had ever found in tropic
jungles had not been more than two inches
high and this was-twenty feet the
the conquest of the moon pool



scientific fire i had experienced in the
tunnel returned uncontrollable i parted
the fronds gazed out froze with sheer
wonder

  my outlook commanded a vista of miles
-and that vista a fata morgana of
plantdom a scheherazades garden of en-
chantment a land of flowered sorcery

  forests of tree-high mosses spangled
over with blooms of every conceivable
shape and color cataracts and clusters
avalanches and nets of blossoms in pastels
in dulled metallics in gorgeous fiambojrant
hues some of them phosphorescent and
shining like living jewels some sparkling
as though with dust of opals of sapphires
of rubies and topazes and emeralds
thickets of convolvuli like the trumpets
of the seven arch-angels of mara king
of illusion which are shaped from the
bows of splendors arching his highest
heaven

  and moss veils like banners of a march-
ing host of titans pennons and bannerets
of the sunset gonfalons of the jinn webs
of faery oriflammes of elfland

  springing up through that polychro-
matic flood of myriads of pedicles-slender
and straight as spears or soaring in spirals
or curving with undulations gracile as the
white serpents of tanit in ancient cartha-
ginian groves and all surmounted by a
fantasie of spore cases in shapes of
minaret and turret domes and spires and
cones caps of phrygia and bishops miters
shapes grotesque and unnameable shapes
that were delicate and lovely

  as i gazed breath strangled with awe
a sound began to come to us reaching out
like the first faint susurrus of the incoming
tide sighing sighing growing stronger
now its mournful whispering quivered all
about us shook us then passing like a
presence it died away in far distances

  the portal said rador lugur has
entered 

  he too parted the fronds and peered
back along our path

  and then-

  holy st brigid gasped larry-

  from the rift in the tunnels continua-

tion nigh a mile beyond the cleft through
which we had fled lifted a crown of horns
-of tentacles-erect alert of mottled
gold and crimson it lifted higher and
from a monstrous scarlet head beneath
them blazed two enormous opaque eyes
their depths wells of purplish phosphor-
escence higher still-noiseless earless
chinless a livid worm mouth from which
a slender scarlet tongue leaped like play-
ing flames

  slowly it rose its mighty neck cuirassed
with gold and scarlet scales from whose
polished surfaces the amber light glinted
like flakes of fire and under this neck
shimmered something like a palely lumi-
nous silvery shield guarding it more and
more it drew into sight as the head of
horror mounted and in the shields center
full ten feet across glowing flickering
pulsating shining out coldly was a rose
of white flame a flower of cold fire
even as rador had said

now swiftly the thing upreared
standing like a scaled tower a
hundred feet above the rift its eyes
scanning that movement i had seen along
the course of its lair there was a hissing
the crown of horns fell whipped and
writhed like the tentacles of an octopus
the towering length dropped back

  quick gasped rador and through
the fern moss along the path and down
the other side of the steep we raced

  behind us for an instant there was a
rushing as of a torrent a far-away faint
agonized screaming-silence

  no fear now from those who followed
whispered the green dwarf pausing

  sainted st patrick okeefe gazed
ruminatively at his automatic an he
expected me to kill that with this well
as fergus oconnor said when they sent
him out to slaughter a wild bull with a
potato knife yell niver rayilize how i
appreciate the confidence ye show in
me

  the dragon worm rador said

  it was helvede orm-the hell worm
groaned olaf


famous fantastic mysteries

  there you go again- blazed larry
but the green dwarf was hurrying down
the path and swiftly we followed

  the scene in front of us was oddly
weird and depressing in some indefinable
way-dreadful

  the curious mossy fringe were like dis-
torted images of dog and deerlike forms
of birds-of dwarfs and here and there
the simulacra of the giant frogs spore
cases yellowish green as large as miters
and much resembling them in shape pro-
truded from the heaps my repulsion grew

  rador turned to us a face whiter far
than that with which he had looked upon
the dragon worm

  now for your lives he whispered
tread softly here as i do and speak not
at all

  he stepped forward on tiptoe slowly
with utmost caution we crept after him
passed the heaps beside the path and as
i passed my skin crept and i shrank and
saw the others shrink too with that un-
nameable loathing nor did the green
dwarf pause until he had reached the brow
of a small hillock a hundred yards beyond
and he was trembling

 now what the devil are we up
against muttered okeefe

  the green dwarf stretched a hand
stiffened gazed over to the left of us
beyond a lower hillock upon whose broad
crest lay a file of the moss shapes they
fringed it their miters having a grotesque
appearance of watching what lay below
and now i saw that the glistening road
lay below-and from it came a shout a
dozen of the coria were there filled with
lugurs men and in one of them lugur
himself laughing wickedly

  there was a rush of soldiers and up
the low hillock raced a score of them to-
ward us

  run shouted rador

 not much grunted okeefe-and
took swift aim at lugur the automatic
spat olafs echoed both bullets went
wide for lugur still laughing threw him-
self into the protection of the body of
his shell but following the shots from

the file of moss heaps came a series
of muffled explosions under the pistols
conewssions the mitered caps had burst
and instantly all about the running
soldiers grew a cloud of tiny glistening
white spores like a little cloud of puff-ball
dust many times magnified through this
cloud i glimpsed their faces stricken with
an agony i could not fathom

  some turned to fly but before they
could take a second step stood rigid

  the spore cloud drifted and eddied
about them rained down on their heads
and half bare breasts covered their gar-
ments-and swiftly they began to change
their features grew indistinct merged
the glistening white spores that covered
them turned to a pale yellow grew
greenish spread and swelled darkened
the eyes of one of the soldiers glinted
for a moment and then were covered by
the swift growth

  where but a few moments before had
been men were only grotesque heaps
swiftly melting swiftly rounding into the
semblance of the mounds that lay behind
us-and already beginning to take on
their gleam of ancient viridescence

  the irishman was gripping my arm
fiercely the pain brought me back to my
senses

  olafs right he gasped this is hell
im sick

  lugur and his companions awakened
from their nightmare piled into the coria
wheeled raced awtay

  on said rador thickly two perils
have we passed the silent ones watch
over us

soon we were again among the
familiar and so unfamiliar moss
giants i knew what i had seen and this
time larry could not call me superstitious
in the jungles of borneo i had examined
that other swiftly developing fungus which
wreaks the vengeance of some of the hill
tribes upon those who steal their women
gripping with its microscopic hooks into
the flesh sending quick tiny rootlets
through the skin down into the capillaries
the conquest of the moon pool



sucking life and thriving and never to be
torn away until the living thing it clings
to has been sapped dry

  here was but another of the species in
which the developments rate was in-
credibly accelerated

  rador stopped in front of us was again
the road ribbon

  now is all danger passed he said
 the way lies open and lugur has de-
liberately fled-

  there was a flash from the road it
passed me like a little lariat of light it
struck larry squarely between the eyes
spread over his face and drew itself within

  down cried rador and hurled me
to the ground my head struck sharply
i felt myself grow faint olaf fell beside
me i saw the green dwarf draw down the
okeefe he collapsed limply face still
eyes staring a shou-t and from the road-
way poured a host of lugurs men

  there came a rush of little feet soft
fragrant draperies brushed my face dimly
i watched lakla bend over the irishman

  she straightened her arms swept out
and the writhing vine with its tendriled
heads of ruby bloom five flames of misty
incandescence leaped into the face of
the soldiers now close upon us it darted
at their throats striking coiling and strik-
ing again coiling and uncoiling with in-
credible rapidity and flying from leverage
points of throats of faces of breasts like
a great green spring endowed with con-

sciousness volition and hatred and those
it struck stood rigid with faces masks of
inhuman fear and anguish and those still
unstriken fled

   another rush of feet and down upon
  lugurs forces poured the frog-men their
 booming giant leading thrusting with their
 lances tearing and rending with talons
 and fangs and spurs

   against that onrush the dwarfs could
 not stand they raced for the shells i
 heard lugur shouting menacingly and
 then laklas voice pealing like a golden
 bugle of wrath

   go lugur she cried go that you
 and yolara and your shining one may die
 together death for you lugur death
 for you all remember lugur-death
 there was a great noise within my head
 -no matter lakla was here lakla here
 -but too late lugur had outplayed us
 moss death nor dragon worm had
 frightened him away he had crept back
 to trap us lakla had come too late larry
 was dead- larry but i had heard no
 banshee wailing and larry had said he
 could not die without that warning no
 larry was not dead

   a horny arm lifted me two enormous
 oddly gentle saucer eyes were staring into
 mine my head rolled i caught a glimpse
 of lakla kneeling beside the okeefe

   the noise in my head grew thunderous
 was carrying me away on its thunder-
 swept me into soft blind darkness

the large maiil cabin and made his effort-
less way down a corridor to the nearest
port-window he stared out into the void
the immovable stars did not show that
that ship was plunging through space at
half the speed of light

  dave standish was not quite twenty-one
years old for the last seventeen of those
years he had seen the same changeless
vista of star-spotted emptiness that he
now viewed how many countless times
in the past with nose pressed flat against
the flawless quartz plate his childish eyes
and wondering mind had struggled to
grasp the meaning of this abysm around
the ship

  as a child of eight he had stood at this
same port-window certain that he was
the center of the universe

  this had been the only world he had
really known

  he had memories of that other world
in which he had lived to the age of four
but it was a dream world a strange
fairyland world in which you walked
around in a ship so big that you could
not see the ceiling and there had been
an enormous brilliant lamp up high that
they moved over your head

  when they had hidden this big lamp
under the floor at bedtimes the big cabin
had become dark no not always dark
he remembered sometimes they had hung
out another softer lamp one with a curious
face on it they had called it the moon-
light the bright one was the sun-light
and then there had been the star-lights
too at night such as he could see from
this smaller cabin

  but that was a dream-world faded in
memory this smaller cabin surrounded
only by star-lights was real this had
been the child dave standishs world for
years and he had not questioned its exist-
ence or reason no more than a child of
eight on earth would have questioned the
existence of earth or his life on it he
had asked questions of course but they
had been idle ones of purely childish
curiosity but after the age of eight deeper
questions rose in his mind

  the chronometer in the main cabin had
clicked on steadily the hours grew into
days the days into years a twelve year
old dave standish had stood before this
same port-window and suddenly realized
that a ship was something that went some-
where dr roscoe in the role of teacher
had begun on the history and geography
of earth and the groundwork of science

  dave standish slowly realized that the
other ship had been something more
than a ship it took him many many
months of thoughtful reasoning to finally
accept the truth the other ship had
been a large world tremendously larger
and more complex in all its phases than
he was able to conceive at first he real-
ized the star-lights were no longer little
lamps hung just around the ship they
were big blazing suns scattered far and
wide

  and their ship was not hanging motion-
lessly it was moving among these suns-

rrme grown-up dave standish thinking
a and staring out at the stars could
still remember the thrill of his sixteenth
birthday on that day dr roscoe had
darkened the cabin and given him his
first taste of talking and moving pictures
they became an important part of daves
life in the next few years

  once he had run through the hundreds
of reels there were he re-ran them again
and again his narrow iron-bound world
peopled itself with fantoms that became
almost real as he viewed them over and
over

  almost but not quite it was a strange
new world to dave standish one before
which there was always a cloud he would
never understand it fully till he saw it
with his own eyes he sighed when he
thought of the remoteness of that event

  that it was a stupendous journey they
were on dave standish had come to re-
alize as his practical knowledge increased
at first he had taken it for granted but
now he realized what powerful engines the
ship had to achieve half the speed of
light the builders had had to design an


famous fantastic mysteries

engine and ship to carry two passengers
almost twenty thousand times as far as
the distance from earth to pluto

  this entailed a proportionate increase
of fuel and food to last for almost a
half century in the earthly scale of
monetary value the ship was as costly
as a small war certainly the motive be-
hind its launching must be gravely im-
portant he had reflected many times the
entire project was for getting him dave
standish to some destination and back
everything had been planned to the last
detail for that end

  to what detail dave only realized when
dr roscoe told him he -had been chosen
for perfect health and strong mind from
thousands of other children and before
he had been put aboard the ship doctors
had given him a mild attack of each of
the childhood diseases for the purpose of
filling his blood with the natural anti-
bodies every precaution had been taken
to increase his chances of surviving the
long trip into the void

  but just why the trip and where were
they going that had been the great mys-
tery on his twenty-first birthday dave
standish was to be told

  but before that time came dr roscoe
had a siege of weakness and sank fast
he grew gaunt and thin he had always
shunned the port-windows his staring eyes
seemed ever to have a lurking terror in
them he did not like to look out into
abysmal space

  dave bringing his thoughts now to the
recent past was not quite sure what dr
roscoe had died from he had been fairly
young not more than fifty and excep-
tionally vigorous in health at the start
he too had been chosen carefully some-
thing more in this stupendous trip than
advancing senility had brought him to his
death-bed

  he had been more or less in a de-
lirium for the past week for hours at
a time he had babbled to the younger
man about earth it seemed to give him
a sad pleasure to tell of moonlit nights
and the gentle breezes of spring of laugh-

ter and crowds cities and sun-drenched
countrysides

  qave had listened attentively faintly
stirred but he didnt really understand
he was no part of that world

  then in the last hour the old scien-
tists mind had cleared he had taken the
boys hand in a bony clasp and whispered
hoarsely with a queer terrified light in
his sunken eyes

  i will never see earth again he had
said the void has taken its toll it has
shattered my mind you have no fear of
the abysses of space have you dave
you couldnt have-its your world the
only one you really know thank god
for that

v dave had not understood more than
the bare words he saw nothing about
space to frighten one dr roscoe had
gone on fighting off the death rattle in
his throat

  i must reveal to you before i go the
destination and purpose of this trip it is
something ive delayed telling you be-
cause your mind was not fully matured
-not fully prepared to understand i
had hoped to be with you longer

  he had waved limply with his thin
hand bitter lines etched in his old face
eyes burning he had spoken on

  our ship is heading for the binary
star -cygni in the constellation cygnus
the swan it is eleven light-years from
earth sixty-six trillions of miles-if you
can conceive such a number and distance
at our velocity of half the light speed
it is a trip of twenty-two years five
years from now when you are twenty-six
you will reach -cygni

  dave had not been too surprised at
the revelation of their destination with
his astronomical knowledge he had al-
ready suspected their goal he nodded si-
lently as dr roscoe resumed

  you will land on one of -cygnis
planets for a purpose greater than any
before in the history of the human race
a deeply tragic look had come into
the scientists face his voice croaked on
in almost defeated tones
son of the stars



  you remember from your history les-
sons that after the second world war
of -a century ago-a world state
was formed a supreme ruling body was
elected they were scientists as well as
statesmen under their leadership the
world and science forged ahead rapidly

  then disaster came all sciences had
advanced but particularly biology drunk
with a certain vital discovery a group
of biologists brought a doom to mankind
doom 

dr roscoes voice had choked his
eyes had reflected a deep agony
dave stood before him bewildered vaguely
aware of some grave problem eating like
an acid in the scientists soul he had re-
covered himself and gone on in a bare
whisper

  they radiated artificial cosmic-rays all
over earth in order to speed up mutational
evolution it was planned that all hu-
manity at once in one or two generations
would mutate to a higher level a year
later they examined the new crop of babies
eagerly and then it was seen that some-
thing had gone wrong

  a living horror came over the scientists
haggard features he clenched his bony
hands tightly

  of the first group of babies half were
normal-the same as before but half the
remaining were mutations insane at birth
and the rest were atavists-throwbacks
to the subman mans tampering with
the normal course of evolution had re-
sulted in catastrophe it was too-easily
calculated that an less than a century there
would be only the two mutations left-
large-headed insane creatures and the ugly
half-apelike submen

  they realized it must be stopped this
terrible misdirection of evolution first
of all the two mutations were killed off
as fast as they were born but then the
ghastly truth became known the cosmic-
ray process had destroyed an important
delicate hormone in every living soul on
earth without this hormone the muta-
tions could not be checked worst of

all the biologists did not know its chem-
ical composition

  dr roscoe had leaned back for a mo-
ment exhausted by his emotional strain
then he went on weakly

  you knew nothing of this dave you
were too young you are one of the
last of the normal babies born on earth
in the past fifty years if this mission
fails-

  the scientist broke off and began again

  realizing the doom the biologists tried
to undo their evil but there seemed no
salvation in earthly science they could
not determine the complicated chemical
molecule which no longer existed on earth
finally it was decided that the last hope
must lie away from earth away from
the solar system perhaps among the
nearer stars might be found an answer
to the problem it was and is a forlorn
hope but no possibility could be left
untried

  -cygni is the only star within reach
with planets every scrap of earths ra-
dium went into this ships engines there-
fore on us-on you dave-depends the
entire fate of the human race

  dr roscoes voice had become very
weak then

  i have written out very carefully what
you must do when you reach -cygni
your return to earth supposing all is
successful will be just in time to forestall
the inevitable end atavism and false mu-
tation

  his voice became suddenly anxious

  do you understand my boy some-
times you have stared at me so blankly
perhaps it was a mistake to take you from
earth at the age of four it was thought
best to take one at that age so that his
young mind might be easily molded into
the harsh mental rigors of a lifetime of
space travel you will return to earth
a man of forty-eight but on the other
hand you have no real conception of life
on earth or of the grave importance of
this mission

  his thin voice rose almost to a shriek

  but you must understand dave


famous fantastic mysteries

  i will do everything as you have told
me dave had promised emotionlessly

  my spirit will be with you my boy

  these were the last sane words dr
roscoe had spoken his mind snapped
then a few minutes later babbling end-
lessly of the things of earth he had
fallen into the final coma never to awaken

  following instructions dave shoved the
body out of the air-lock out of the ship

for five more years the super-ship
plummeted into the void

  all things save his own existence became
like a dream to dave he was not lonesome
in the true sense of the word he did
miss dr roscoe for a time but had
no terror of being alone in the yawning
space that would have driven any other
human being to utter insanity he me-
thodically ate slept read scientific books
inspected the air and heat meters and
had little sense of time passing

  he noticed the arrival of dec th on
the automatic calendar and remembered
that dr roscoe had attached some par-
ticular significance to that date but to
dave standish son of the stars it meant
nothing he ran what few of the movie
films were not already worn out for
diversion till they too were useless his
main interest in those five years was
to look out at the stars hours on end

  dave standish had never read a book
of fiction he had never since the- age
of four seen another human being out-
side of dr roscoe had never seen the
workings of a mind similar to his own
had never felt a wind on his face a
laugh in his ears a kiss on his cheek
had never pondered his place in a so-
ciety of many others or read a news-
paper or heard a radio had never ex-
perienced the full emotions of fear hate
love anger pity or happiness

  the mind of dave standish was a
world of its own

  but it was a mind admirably suited
to its task as cold and unformed as
space itself and by that token as stable

  a month before he was twenty-six years

old he sat himself at the pilot board and
brought the mighty atomic-engines to
roaring life the ship had previously been
turfted around so that its rocket-side
pointed toward -cygni long streamers
of flame shot ahead of the ship and drifted
past the port-windows the universe
seemed on fire

  dave was soon annoyed with the steady
rumble and throb of the rockets he had
liked the perfect silence of space better
however there was no choice for six
months the rockets belched their braking
energies slowing the ship down from its
titanic velocity of ninety-three thousand
miles a second

  when five months of deceleration had
passed -cygni grew rapidly brighter
till it was the most brilliant star in the
firmament after a time it bulged out at
the two sides to his eyes and eventually
split into two separate components one
was a huge red sun the other a smaller
yellow one when the latter which was
nearer began to display a disk the
planets appeared

  the ship had now come to a full stop
and dave standish turned off the rockets
he made rapid calculations and found
the outermost planet was five billion miles
from the yellow sun a cold airless body

  he turned the ship by offside rocket
and blasted closer - to the yellow sun
another planet appeared still two billion
miles from its primary also frozen and
sure to be utterly lifeless by all earthly
standards the ship passed five more
planets two ringed like saturn and finally
reached a position about one hundred
million miles from the central sun

  dave took up a planetary orbit he
was following instructions left by dr
roscoe in a narrow zone between eighty-
five million and one hundred and ten
million miles must be found a planet if
there were one if it were further out
it would be comparable to mars and
would probably be as desiccated and de-
serted of life if it were closer it would
be a steamy planet like venus no fit
abode for higher evolutionary life
son of the stars



  on that one chance-a planet in the
right orbit-rested the hopes of accom-
plishing the mission for which the giant
ship had been sent sixty-six trillion miles
through the gulfs of space

  dave standish felt no particular emo-
tion when he finally did sight a planet
in an orbit one hundred and five million
miles from the yellow sun he suspected
that if dr roscoe had been living he
would have gone wild with joy but
ave himself felt little beyond a certain
ientific satisfaction

  the planet grew in size as he laid

  direct course for it it soon appeared
is a large greenish ball surrounded by
i hazy white atmosphere it stirred a deep
memory within dave though he did not
know quite why he eased the ship into
the atmosphere and took up an orbital
ourse in what woulcl be its stratosphere

  a fter girding the globe twice and
ifv seeing definite signs of civilization
jelow he lowered the ship toward the
largest of what must be cities but it
as a fantastic city that his ship hovered
over finally-strange and beautiful it
overed hundreds of square miles of ter-
ritory along a sea-coast and shone green
vith the great areas of park-like spaces
n its confines the low widely-separated
buildings were all of iridescent stone
magnificently architectured and perforated
with endless rows of windows into which
warm sunshine poured there was no
smoke or grime in this wonderful city

  dave increased the drumming of his
rockets and turned the pancake ship flat
side down lowering away carefully he
landed in a wide meadow-land just out-
side the city limits with a cushioned jar
that was taken up mainly by the system
of pneumatic landing skids then he
turned off the engines that had performed
such prodigious labors and ran to the
nearest port-window

  for an hour he gazed out lost in a
staring trance

  for the first time in twenty-two ears
rp was on a world vagre memories stirred

in him memories of a long eternity ago
when as a tiny child he had lived on
such a world but his best imagination
had never pictured for his adult mind
what a world was really like

  he felt utterly bewildered he could
scarcely believe that there could be a
stretch of unmetallic matter reaching to
all the horizons as his eyes saw

  and sunlight-what an amazing thing
that was the whole sky was filled with
its blazing light hiding the stars for
a moment dave was frightened for the
stars had been his companions almost
all his life

  it was all like a dream to dave stan-
dish after the landing and yet it was
a vivid dream much more so than that
other faded dream of earth

  soon a line of human-like figures ap-
peared from the city and came up to the
ship they were so startlingly like him-
self that dave gasped in astonishment
they had delicate pointed ears narrow
mouths long greenish hair and rather
long arms and legs but outside of those
things were essentially human

  the beings stopped before the ship and
stared in obvious amazement talking ex-
citedly to one another then they spied
daves face at the port-window and waved
for him to come out he instinctively un-
derstood the gesture

  dave stepped out

  he took his first breath of pungent air
that did not come from a tank and it
made him dizzy like wine he felt a
breeze on his skin and a tingling went
through his whole body he stooped to
the ground and picked up a handful of
dirt and grass letting it trickle through
his fingers he did not know why but a
saltiness stung his eyes

  then he noticed that the people had
crowded around him staring open-
mouthed dave stared back just as avidly
wondering how there could be so many
different faces and yet all essentially alike
they were dressed in colorful flowing
robes finally a fall being stepped forward
and spoke the sound of the voire was


famous fantastic mysteries

pleasant and soprano but the words were
quite incomprehensible to dave

  with a shock that swept all through his
body dave was suddenly aware that this
creature was a woman furthermore most
of the crowd round about were women
they were all tall there were some men
but they were shorter and hung back as
though quite timid

  and then daves eyes struck the face of
one certain girl near him and a new sen-
sation went through him not quite a
new sensation for he had felt the same
warm throbbing when viewing a girl in
a movie-reel years and years ago in the
ship only now the sensation was inten-
sified-almost overpowering

  though he did not know it dave stan-
dish stood there pouring out his whole
soul into the eyes of that girl they were
laughing violet eyes on earth it would
have been known as wearing his heart
on his sleeve

  the effect on the crowd was almost
electrical all the women began talking
softly to one another and looking from
him to the violet-eyed girl finally the
one who had tried to speak to him went
smilingly to the girl took her hand and
led her close to dave giving him the hand

  dave felt a new terrifying rapture tingle
through his nerves at that contact the
hand was warm soft clinging the violet
eyes were close now and in them too
was a strange light dave could not realize
it then but by the custom of this ma-
triarchal civilization he had already been
married to the violet-eyed girl in their
eyes their human relationships as he
was to learn were far simpler than those
of earth but dave knew nothing of those
things at the time he knew only that he
wanted the violet-eyed girl more than
anything else in the universe

  the girl now tugged at his hand to-
ward the city dave went along unresist-
ing and the two were followed by the
great crowd that had come to see the ship
the crowd sang dave was led through
their arboreal city lit by warm sun-
shine and perfumed by the thousands of

varieties of flowers which bordered every
walk there was no clap-trap of cars or
vehicles of any kind nor any noise by
any earthly comparison it was a utopian
city with laughing happy inhabitants and
simple but magnificent surroundings it
was a completely unmechanical civilization
blessed by a kind climate

  people that passed stared curiously at
the strange tall man with drab clothes
but they smiled too dave found himself
smiling back though it hurt the muscles
of his mouth he had not smiled for five
years in the ship at last the violet-eyed
girl led him into a tiny house she turned
at the door to wave at the crowd and
it dispersed

  when they were alone together they
looked into one anothers eyes and spoke
a language that made no use of words
then the violet-eyed girl laughed and the
man from space laughed with her she dis-
appeared into another room to come back
with a heaping bowl of strange luscious
fruits they ate laughing in each others
eyes

time passed with the swiftness of a
beautiful dream for dave standish

  he learned their simple language quickly
and soon came to know what an idyllic
existence the woman-ruled civilization of
this planet was he knew a happiness in
his simple life with tara his wife that
he had always subconsciously hungered
for

  when he tried to explain to her his
presence on their world he became con-
fused all that had passed before in his
previous life was a forgotten dream he
even lost curiosity in the great ship in
which he had come it was still there
where he had landed it viewed daily by
thousands of people of this garden planet
called rendora

  at times dave would have a disturbed
feeling that he should remember some-
thing in connection with the ship it had
something to do with the man who had
once lived in it with him they had come
from another world where he had been
son of the stars



born and he was supposed to go back
for some reason

  dave was quite clear in one part of
his mind what it was all about but in
another part of his mind the whole thing
seemed inconsequential what did that
world mean to him so far away in the
void he had barely lived on it a few
years its troubles were no concern of
his he had never really been a part of
that world had never understood what
its complex life was

  but rendora was a world he could un-
derstand one that he belonged in

  daily he went out into the fields with
tara and the others and tilled their
bountiful soil rendora had no severe
winters and gathered harvests all through
the year at night in the city there was
music and dancing and gaiety and friend-
ship and comfort there were no wars
or struggles no tyranny misadjustments or
poverty everyone had a place in this
life and everyone was happy

  what could draw dave back to a world
sixty-six trillion miles away one whose
salient features had been warfare suf-
fering misery and a terrible never-un-
derstandable complexity one part of
daves mind knew a word called duty
but no part of his mind could interpret
that word into human terms

  one day when he had lived almost a
year on rendora tara revealed a secret
with a shining light in her eyes dave
felt almost weak at the news they
awaited the event eagerly happier than
they had been before

  the day came and dave standish felt
as though the universe had crashed about
his head when the news was delivered
to him in a blind panic he went to see for
himself there it was an ugly hairy little
creature with an apelike face making
little grunting sounds tara was weeping
as though she would never stop and
avoided his eyes

  dumfounded unbelieving dave stared
at his offspring then suddenly it came
to him like a bolt of lightning

  the doom of earth

  how had he hoped to escape it for
he too had been bathed by that unfor-
tunate cosmic ray process that had de-
stroyed the regulating hormone of evolu-
tion by the progressive mendelian laws
which he knew to the last letter he might
have two normal babies out of ten but
the others would be like this and the
insane mutants dr roscoe had told him
about

  this was a living symbol of the doom
that faced all earth and in his sudden
anguish dave realized what the doom
meant to earth people millions like
himself back there on earth had gone
through this same turmoil that seemed
to be tearing his soul to shreds and mil-
lions more would till earth was eventu-
ally tenantless by true man entirely pop-
ulated only by vast hordes of sub-crea-
tures and horrible mutants that was
the doom that dr roscoe had tried to
impress him with and which up till now
dave had not been able to sympathize
with

  earths mankind was doomed

  unless-

  dave standish suddenly sprang from his
moaning wifes bedside and ran all the
way to the ship arriving half dead with
fatigue he climbed the steps and ran
to the central cabin feverishly he pulled
a notebook from what had been dr
roscoes desk and read its contents the
words would have had little meaning
to him an hour before now they did-a
wonderful glorious meaning

  dave ran back to the city stood him-
self on the steps of the central building
and addressed the crowd that quickly
gathered as his male voice thundered over
the crowd of women for an hour he
talked and knew that the ruling matriarchs
above on the balconies were also listen-
ing

  when he had finished most of the crowd
were weeping and dave knew that he
would have no trouble he shouted in-
structions and a great mass of them fol-
lowed him to his ship he ran to the
supply rooms and hauled out crated mech-


famous fantastic mysteries

anisms with which he drew a pint of blood
from each person with the willing help
of others this blood was sealed into
waiting cans that had been made on
earth for that purpose thousands of cans
were filled in the next day till there were
no more left

  this life-blood of one world given to
another would save earth for in it were
contained traces of the subtle hormone
lost to human life the hormone that
made all the difference in the universe be-
tween wild unbridled evolution and nor-
mal life earths eager chemists would
isolate that hormone that had been com-
pletely destroyed on earth through folly
and would manufacture it in huge quan-
tities to be given to all earth people

  all that was in dr roscoes notebook
but he had not even known if such a
planet could be found with an evolution
similar to earths and he had not known
that dave standish finding it would not
begin carrying out this project until driven
to it by the finger of fate

  dave did not waste a minute when the
cans had all been filled sealed and stored
in the ship he prepared immediately for
take-off he was leaving rendora a world
he would never see again and in which
he had been supremely content he was
leaving tara and knew that he would
never again love another woman he was
leaving happiness itself but he did not
hesitate

  tara begged to come along no matter
what the sacrifice but dave with a deep
wisdom forbade it her mind would not
stand the harshness of a trip through
empty void for twenty-two years only
he nurtured and inured by the void al-
ready could do it

  his ship soared up and away glinting
brightly in a yellow sunlight that would
not again shine on it for twenty-two years
rendora dwindled and dave standish felt
as though he had left his soul behind
but within himself he felt a deep calm
satisfaction earths prodigal son was re-
turning though he had been a son of the
stars for most of his life

twenty-two years and four months
later the giant pancake ship lowered
toward earth

  the sight of it opened a wound in
daves heart by its very resemblance to
rendora the paradise he had left to ful-
fill his mission dave standish was forty-
nine years old now his hair streaked with
gray forty-four of those years had been
spent in harsh space yet dave could not
feel bitter at this sacrifice of his normal
life the tremendous importance of his
journey was now clear to him that grunt-
ing hairy little creature born to tara-

  he only hoped and prayed it wasnt too
late for earth the false mutation had
had almost fifty years full play perhaps
in that time humanitys numbers had been
greatly depleted they had probably main-
tained a rigid birth-control to keep from
spawning more and more of the unde-
sired mutants he would save them

  by use of an old map dave was able
to orientate himself over the world he had
never seen except with childish eyes of
four he picked out new york city and
landed on its huge long island space-
drome attendants ran up to his ship when
he had turned off the hot blasts and be-
gan fastening hooks to drag it out of the
way of other descending craft it was a
busy place dave was rather amazed

  he had hardly expected to see this
much activity in a race faced with extinc-
tion dozens of ships were being loaded
and unloaded figures scurried by cease-
lessly

  as soon as dave opened his hatch he
shouted aloud in pure exuberance at being
back safe and sound and with the means
in his hands of saving mankind then
he shouted above the noises to the atten-
dants below who didnt seem to notice
his ship was any different from the hun-
dreds of others that came and went in
the interplanetary trade routes

  im dave standish dont you know
me im the one who went to -cygni
with dr roscoe im back and in my
hold i have thousands of cans of red
blood-life-giving blood from rendora
son of the stars

- 

the mission was completely successful
humanity is saved bring me to the
officials 

  he was baffled at their lack of enthu-
siasm they looked at one another
strangely then one of them shouted back
come down we will take you before
the masters

  as dave strode among them toward the
dromes offices he saw the men looking at
him sorrowfully as though they pitied
him for something he did not know rather
than the frightful journey he had made
dave was mystified even when he saw
the queer large-headed man into whose
presence he was ushered

  dave standish murmured the tall
thin official his bulging cranium and lofty
brow fully twice that of an average
mans gave him a severely intellectual
look dave began to feel a crushing in-
feriority

  so you have returned went on the
strange man too bad

  what do you mean gasped dave
i have the hold of my ship filled with

cans of blood from rendora from -
cygni surely you remember

  that blood is being spilled already
into the ground announced the official
dave standish your mission was a mis-
take a worthless trip the large-headed
mutation at first thought to be an insane
type was in reality a new species of man
so infinitely superior that they did seem
insane former man like yourself is a
comparative atavist

  i am of the new species we run earth
now we outnumber former man your
fellows five to one they are our servants
menials subordinates but we treat them
kindly however we are letting them die
out they have all been sterilized you are
among the last of former mankind

  the large-headed man stopped suddenly
startled he peered closely at his listener
at his queerly distorted face-

  rendora tara

  the lips of dave standish moaned
then they writhed open to issue a horrible
laughter that made the large-headed man
shudder and feel sick with pity

while experimenting with the wireless transmission of matter myles cabot
transmits himself to the planet venus where he falls in love with a beautiful
native to win her he must free her country from its ant-men conquerors

       chapter x

before queen formis

 and so while my princess was
h borne northward by her cousin and
 - iover prince yuri i was led south-
ward in chains a prisoner charged with
high treason against the ant empire yuri
had tricked me and had used me as a
cats-paw to rescue his sweetheart from
her captors but if i had not been so
blindly in love i should have seen through
him and could have married lilia at peace
under formian auspices

  yet somehow i did not feel sorry for
what i had done i had set lilia free i
had won her love and trust for one night
and i was prepared to pay the penalty in
fact i was glad to pay the penalty for i
realized that marriage between her a prin-
cess and me a commoner would of
course never have been possible

  back in my old room again in wau-
toosa it seemed like home somehow and
yet how different from before for now i
was no longer a guest but a prisoner

  tabby my pet buntlote was glad to
smell me again and my conscience gave
me a twinge for having so unceremoni-
ously left her behind yet if i had taken
her with me what would have become of
her in the wreck of the kerkool and the
flight through the spiders tunnel

  doggo was overwhelmed with grief at
the jam i was in and he was reproachful
too

  why did you do it he would ask
again and again and in spite of my re-

peated and detailed explanations would
reiterate why did you do it when all
was going so well here

  guards were placed over me again as
on my first arrival on the planet but
this time instead of being high ranking
officers such as doggo they were mere
common soldier ants who jested coarsely
at me and without sympathy

  i complained to doggo and he promptly
put a stop to their tormenting and when
they found that i was still in the good
graces of one of their eklats they be-
came on the surface quite deferential al-
though they continued to annoy me in
many petty and underhanded ways

  doggo spent a great deal of his time
with me and kept me posted on the latest
news from kuana the capital of cupia
in fact he even dispatched one of his bar-
pootahs to ascertain for me just how the
princess fared

  report had it that the princess was al-
most constantly in the company of prince
yuri and that he was hailed as a popular
hero for having rescued her that she
seemed unaccountably sad-which item
cheered me that the king was momenta-
rily expected to announce her betrothal
to prince yuri-which item did not cheer
me that an influential faction headed
by prince toron insisted upon an ex-
planation being demanded from queen
formis because of the detention of prin-
cess lilia by the ant-men and that only
the new popularity of prince yuri was
able to control this movement of his
younger brother

copyright  by the frank a munsey company


  oh what a fool i had been not to have
told lilia that yuri had been responsible
for her imprisonment at wautoosa now
of course she believed him a hero rather
than the scoundrel he was but how could
he satisfactorily explain to her his re-
pudiation of me

  no if she retained the slightest friend-
ly feeling for me she could not regard
him as anything other than a double-
crossing crook and did not the reports
state that she seemed sad why else than
either because of my fate or because she
did not look forward with pleasure to a
union with yuri but if the latter then
why did she associate with him it-tnust
be that he was holding over her head a

threat of some sort my poor princess of
the butterfly wings and graceful antennae

  i tried to get word to her but doggo
informed me that criminals were not al-
lowed the privilege of letter writing

  my interest was so centered in the beau-
tiful lilia that it never occurred to me to
inquire as to my own fate but doggo in-
sisted on bringing it to my attention he
had obtained his own assignment as my
defense counsel and so it was up to him
to discuss with me the coming trial

  i was accused of high treason against
the empire in that i had assisted in the
escape of a cupian slave had uttered a
forged pass had obstructed the highway
had nearly run down a pinqui and had-

the moment had arrived for the
final master stroke in the new
cupian war the big guns boomed
forth again and again




famous fantastic mysteries

presumably-slandered the formians to a
member of the royal house of cupia

  doggo said that i clearly had no de-
fense as all the items except the slander
were easily provable but that he should
attempt to argue that the accusations were
void for inconsistency due to the fact
that the same person was described in
them as being both a slave and royalty
so far as i was concerned this line of
defense seemed absolute bunk but no
more so than many equally silly sounding
legal rules on earth

the trial was to take place at the im-
perial city before queen formis and
the council of twelve for apparently i
had committed a most important and seri-
ous crime in case of conviction which
seemed certain her majesty would have
the choice of two punishments first lay-
ing eggs in me or secondly casting me
into the valley of the howling rocks
both sounded very interesting and were
reserved for the worst criminals

  all of the ant-men of the entire nation
of formia are raised from eggs laid by
the ruling monarch the vocation of any
given ant-man is determined long before
he is hatched or even before his egg is
laid

  from an elaborate system of records
kept in the imperial city the council of
twelve is able to determine as to each
batch of eggs whether it should produce
professors farmers laborers officers sol-
diers servants or what and the eggs are
accordingly laid in appropriate food sort
of tell me what you eat and i will tell-
you what you are

  the young ants when fully grown and
in the cocoon stage are transported by
truckloads to the part of the empire where
they are to be trained and where their
life is to be spent thus the pupae for
soldiers and officers are sent to wautoosa
for instance

  not only is occupation determined in
advance but so also to a large extent is
sex thus only enough males are produced
to supply the queens harem the rest of

the royal offspring being sexless females
whenever a queen dies the council im-
mediately chooses several likely larvae and
changes their food so as to produce fully
developed females the first of these to
reach maturity being made queens and
the rest being killed

  the food chosen for the production
of the higher classes of ant-men consists
of condemned criminals this was where
i came in

  at this point in the explanation an idea
occurred to me

  do you really mean to say doggo i
gasped that you are a lady and not a
man-that the whole nation of formians
are females

  yes he replied and furthermore the
more highly developed of us occasionally
lay eggs though of course we never try
to hatch them for that would be even
worse a treason than the one with which
you are charged i myself even have laid
eggs but it is generally supposed that
such eggs would not hatch

  i could hardly believe it a nation of
amazons i could not help continuing to
regard them as males

  but to go on with the alternative penal-
ties i have described the egg-laying the
other penalty namely the valley of the
howling rocks supplied a most diabol-
ical form of punishment this valley ex-
tends about a mile along the international
boundary line so that the pale stopped
at one end and began again at the other
its sides are steep and unscalable and
into it are cast the worst criminals of both
countries some undetermined natural
cause within the valley sets up such a ter-
rific din that the victims are driven crazy
and perish because of the sound

  i thought that i should prefer any noise
however awful to the alternative of hav-
ing eggs laid in me but doggo assured me
that the valley was by far the worse of
the two however my wishes finally pre-
vailed and doggo promised to try and
secure the valley punishment in event of
a conviction

  in due course the time arrived for the
the radio man



trial and i was led in chains to the im-
perial city doggo accompanied me and
brought along tabby too to console me
for some reason i could not get at all ex-
cited over the performance it seemed so
absurdly like the trial of alice in won-
derland as she is reported to have ex-
claimed why youre nothing but a pack
of cards so i was often tempted to ex-
claim why youre nothing but a nest
of ants

  as a matter of fact i was much more
interested in how my princess was getting
on than i was in my own impending fate

  on the day of the trial i was led into
the awful presence of queen formis she
stood nearly twice the size of any other
formian and her dignity was enhanced by
a raised platform surmounted by a scarlet
canopy which well set off the perfect pro-
portions of her jet-black body

  grouped on each side of her stood six
ant-men whose refined and intelligent ap-
pearance made even my professorial friends
of the university of mooni look like com-
mon worker ants by comparison

  ant messengers hurried to and fro do-
ing the bidding of the dread thirteen while
several large clumsy ants of a type which
i had never seen before wandered aim-
lessly about the chamber

  the royal husbands doggo informed
me

  so these were the drones of formia
they were very stupid looking fellows
who appeared to be accorded great privi-
leges but no deference

my jailers led me to the foot of
the throne where under instructions
from doggo i made a low obeisance to
the queen then i was locked into a wicker
cage at one side and the trial began

  first one of the council read the accu-
sation and then the witnesses were called
each being permitted to tell his story in
his own way and not being subjected to
cross-examination by doggo though any
member of the court could ask him ques-
tions on the whole the procedure seemed
much fairer than a trial on earth fwr the

evident object here was to ascertain the
whole truth unhampered by rules of evi-
dence rather than to afford a sparring
match between rival attorneys

  the keeper of the kerkool-ool at wau-
toosa testified in substance as follows
the prisoner came at me unawares over-
came me and trussed me up in a corner
where it took me a parth and a half to
escape from my bonds while i lay bound
cabot stole prince yuris car i saw no
one with cabot and in fact did not see
cabot take the car but i judge that he
took it for i later found it gone

  i object i cried

  keep quiet doggo growled

  no one else paid any attention to my
interruption

  the witness continued immediately
upon getting loose i notified the winko

  one of the winkos attendants then took
the stand and corroborated him in this it
was a well-framed-up story and i had no
inclination to get the keeper of the ker-
kool-ool into trouble by disputing it

  the traffic sentinel ant gave an exact
and straightforward account of how he had
stopped us and had trapped me into many
damaging statements also how i had tried
to run him down with the kerkool which
was not exactly the truth but doubtless
it had seemed that way to him then he
produced the forged pass which was
handed around and carefully inspected by
the council

  several ant-men then testified as to their
pursuit of us including the wrecking of
their own car by means of ours they had
tried to dig into the tunnel and had failed
so they had killed the spider with a long
pole they had confidently expected to
find us behind the umbrella never before
having seen a double-ended spider cave
they had not scattered through the woods
to cut off our retreat

  even so they could not account for our
escape especially as they had kept the
road from there to the border constantly
patrolled by kerkools from that time on
until my arrest at the third gate you
see they had slipped up by not realizing


famous fantastic mysteries

that i possessed the sense of hearing which
had enabled me to avoid the patrols

  the cupian sentinel at the third gate
had claimed his official privilege of re-
fusing to testify but the ant sentinel
quoted his cupian colleague as saying that
he had let the princess lilia pass through
because he had no authority over members
of the royal family but had duly arrested
me as required by law no mention was
made of prince yuris presence at the
gate to rescue her from me

  i tried to get doggo to object on the
ground of hearsay for this was the first
and only attempt by the prosecution at
identifying my companion in flight and
hence was most damaging but doggo re-
plied that hearsay testimony was perfectly
allowable on poros unless one could im-
peach either the absent or the present wit-
ness how much more sensible than the
rule in america

  then i was called upon

  do i have to take the stand i asked

  no answered doggo but if you
dont your silence will be used against
you

  again a more sensible rule than that
which prevails in america only all these
formian improvements over american
criminal practice were decidedly to my own
disadvantage

  i was just about to tell how yuri had
planned lilias rescue with me when
something stayed me i wish now that it
had not for to have told the truth at this
time would have prevented a tragedy which
later occurred but my new england
spirit of fair play deterred me and i de-
cided to settle with yuri myself and per-
sonally though how i ever hoped to escape
from the ants in order to do so i did not
stop to consider

  so i spoke as follows everything testi-
fied so far is the truth but i wish to ask
your majesty in all respect just what
justification had formia to detain the
princess of cupia as a slave you should
have treated her as visiting royalty and
in that capacity she had a perfect right
to command my assistance and i had a

perfect right to obey let me tell the rulers
of formia that-

  but i got no further for the queen
thundered stop i find the prisoner
guilty by his own admission further evi-
dence is superfluous and i shall proceed
to sentence has any one any suggestions
to make on this subject

  whereupon my old friend the professor
of anatomy stepped forward doggo had
evidently primed him to do me a good turn
for he said

  the prisoner is neither a cupian nor
a formian nor is it apparent just what
sort of animal he is he seems to be a
reasoning species and so can be tried for
a crime and accorded the same privileges
of trial as in the case of a member of
either of the two recognized reasoning
species of this planet but as he is an
unknown type of creature it is extremely
likely that his flesh would prove harmful
to the royal babies accordingly for the
good of the empire i advise that your
majesty impose the more severe of the
alternative sentences namely the valley
of the howling rocks

as no one else present had any sug-
gestion to make queen formis and
the council conferred together for a few
moments and then the sentence was an-
nounced as i hoped it was the valley
the professor had done well

  convicted criminals on poros are not
kept in suspense day after day as on earth
we started for the valley the very next
morning apparently an execution is an
important state occasion on this planet for
a long line of kerkools trailed out of the
imperial city carrying the queen several
of the council and some lesser dignitaries
as well as doggo tabby myself and my
guards

  doggo was deeply touched by grief but
for myself i was still unable to get up
any very great excitement over the affair
perhaps i am a fatalist but i could not
believe that i was really going to die it
all seemed like a dream from which i was
soon about to awake and even if i should
the radio man



appear to die on this planet was it not
likely that i would awake on the earth
again in my boston laboratory and thus
put an end to a very interesting set of
imaginary adventures

  but at this thought a pang stabbed my
heart and i resolved that i had rather
actually die than have it turn out that my
meeting with the princess lilia had not
been a fact

  the authorities permitted me to write
her a note of farewell and doggo guar-
anteed to deliver it personally thus assur-
ing that it would get past yuri into this
letter i crowded all my pent-up love and
urged her to feel no regrets at my having
been sacrificed in her behalf as that sacri-
fice was gladly and happily given

  then i patted my little pet tabby fare-
well turned her over to doggos care and
was led by my executioners to the edge
of the abyss it was a harmless enough
looking gulch but the scores of human
skeletons and ant shells scattered about
the bottom bore mute witness to its dread
possibilities

  and witness not mute was borne by
the volume of noise which rolled up over
the edge of the valley i had thought that
i had heard the limit of stupendous sound
when years ago i stood at the brink of
niagara but the roar which arose from
the valley of the howling rocks dwarfed
even niagara by comparison

  and into this chaos infernal i was about
to be lowered it was of course impossible
to hear spoken farewells so i patted the
side of doggos head good-by at which
last demonstration he turned away broken-
hearted but the others seemed to be thor-
oughly enjoying the spectacle then my
shackles were removed so as to give free
play to my amusing antics during the tor-
ture a strong rope was placed under my
arms and i was lowered into the pit

  even as i passed over the edge my
thoughts consisted chiefly in wondering
not what fate was in store for me but
rather what it was that made the noise
always i shall remain an inquisitive-scien-
tist i suppose

  the noise became unbearable looking
upward as the ropes spun me around i
saw the horrid face of the ant queen leer-
ing over the edge she lifted up a paw to
my surprise the formians who held the
ropes began to raise me again a reprieve
life again on the planet poros with a pos-
sible chance of seeing my princess once
more

  no-merely a respite l or rather a cat-
and-mouse game which they were playing
with me

  several times more i was lowered into
the pit was held there until i could
scarcely bear the noise and then was
hauled up again for a brief breathing
space but finally my feet were permitted
to touch the bottom and the rope was
pulled from beneath my arms

  that awful noise-i cannot describe the
agony of it madly i dashed back and
forth trying to avoid it but there was
no escape

  lilia lilia  i shrieked in agony but
the terrific din kept even me from hearing
my own words

  i stumbled on a boulder fell-and fall-
ing struck my head against a sharp rock

  then blessed oblivion

chapter xi

the valley of the shadow of death

driven crazy by the awful noise i
had finally fallen as many a vic-
tim of the valley of the howling rocks
had done before in falling i had knocked
my head against a stone and had become
unconscious

  at last i gradually came to and the
first thing that i noticed and that brought
me out of my stupor with a jerk was the
fact that absolute silence reigned

  i sat up and looked around yes i was
still in the same valley surrounded by
whitened bones and rusted carapaces but
the oppressive din had ceased had the
death-dealing howls been purely an arti-
ficial creation and had they been turned
off at my supposed decease


famous fantastic mysteries

  my late executioners had gone so i was
free to escape if escape were possible
but first i wished to find out why the
noise had stopped ever the incorrigible
scientist so i arose to my feet and in-
stantly noticed that my headset was off
and was trailing on the ground it must
have been knocked off when my head
struck the rock

  i was just about to replace the phones
over my ears when i heard a roar pro-
ceeding from them and then i realized
that the awful sound for which the valley
was famous was not sound at all but con-
sisted merely in radiations of some sort
which had been caught and translated into
sound by my radio apparatus there were
some advantages after all in my possessing
a different kind of sense of hearing from
that prevalent on poros

  so i switched off my current and then
replaced my headset the next problem
was to get out of the valley not being
confused by the howling roar i had an
advantage over the many victims who had
preceded me undoubtedly it was this
quite natural confusion which had rendered
it impossible for victims in the past to
climb the walls and so had given these
walls their undeserved reputation for un-
scalability even as it was quite a while
elapsed before i found sufficient crevices
conveniently placed so that i could make
my way to the top

  finally i stood at the rim a free man

  and then i voluntarily went back down
again into that valley of death why be-
cause being primarily an inquisitive scien-
tist i wanted to procure samples of the
howling rocks for purposes of analysis if
ever i should be in a laboratory again
so i collected several different kinds of
fragments and did them up in a knotted
corner of my toga

  once more i scaled the steep walls and
stood again at the rim i was free no
one would ever look for me as i was of-
ficially dead i could pass as a cupian
for my disguise was still intact and i had
freshly shaved that morning so as to make
a presentable corpse

  life on poros was ahead of me and
poros held the princess lilia

   the only fly in the ointment was that
i had lost my sense of direction and so
did not know whether i now stood on the
formian or on the cupian side of the pale
accordingly i proceeded with caution
after skirting the valley of the howling
rocks i followed the pale hoping to
come at last to some gate which would
furnish a clue as to which side i was on

   a strong wind was blowing as is usual
on poros and i knew that of course it
blew toward the sea but as i did not
know whether the sea lay east or west
from here the wind was of no assistance
in enabling me to orient myself

   the pale was a thirty-foot sheer wall
of glazed concrete running in practically
a geodesic line across the country some-
times through woods and sometimes
through green fields

  where it ran through the woods the
trees and bushes along it-at least on the
side which i was on-had been cut away
for quite a wide swath evidently for the
purpose of preventing any one from using
them to surmount the walls

   as i could see no one on top of the wall
in either direction i followed this cleared
space which made traveling considerably
more easy there was no fear of detection
except when i passedthrough open fields
but i had to do this quite frequently

   one field contained a herd of the milk-
giving aphids which i had nicknamed
green cows their presence convinced me
that i must still be in formia until i
reflected that i did not know but that
the cupians also raised them

  at last i came to a road which ran
along by the pale for a way and then
curved off again down this road i walked
until i saw ahead of me where the road
topped a slight rise two ant-men coming
toward me instantly i concealed myself in
a tartan bush at one side

soon i heard their approach and sud-
denly noticing that i coud not hear
their voices i switched on my apparatus
the radio man



which had been disconnected ever since i
had replaced my headset in the valley of
the howling rocks thanks to my inde-
structo tube the apparatus was still intact

  and now a strange low growl almost
drowned out what they were saying so
that with difficulty i distinguished the
following words i could swear that i
saw a cupian approaching on the road
ahead of us but now he is nowhere to be
seen

  then the other said never mind what
you saw do you hear what i hear we
had better be on our guard for it sounds
like the roar of some absolutely new and
strange animal

  it sounds to me replied the other
more like the awful valley only much
softer it seems to come from this tartan
bush shall we investigate

  as he mentioned the valley i instantly
realized what was the cause of the trouble
the radioactive fragments tied up in the
corner of my toga had revealed my pres-
ence if i wanted to escape i would have
to leave my precious samples behind with
a sigh i undid the knot dropped the pieces
on the ground and dashed out through the
back of the bush just as the ant-men broke
in through the front of it it was lucky
for me that my pursuers had no ordinary
sense of hearing or they would have heard
my departure

  safe in another bush i listened to their
amazed remarks at finding the stones but
after puzzling and debating for some time
they finally resumed their journey

  i was about to return for my specimens
when i reflected that they might attract
other attention and might even serve as
a clue to suggest that i was a convict
escaped from the awful valley so i re-
luctantly left them lying where they were

  instead of continuing along the road
however i now retraced my steps to the
wall for the presence of the ant-men had
made me certain that i was still in formia
and hence it became necessary for me to
find some place where i could get through
to the other side accordingly i proceeded
along beside the wall

  the day was warm and moist as are all
days on poros but as i went on the
weather got hotter damper and more op-
pressive finally the sky began to turn
dark

  aha said i now it is evening and
i shall be able to get my bearings by the
pink light in the west

  but no pink light appeared on any hand
never before had i seen a night descend
like this upon this planet then with a
crash the sky was split in two by a living
flame and the storm broke in all its fury

  the roar of the thunder was like a con-
tinuous artillery barrage spiral vorticles
of wind hurled the rain in my face and
nearly twisted me off my feet as i an-
chored myself to a tree trunk to withstand
its fury

  but fortunately the storm was as brief
as it was severe and soon i was again
pressing on beneath silver skies

  in spite of the storm the weather kept
on getting more and more oppressive un-
til on cresting a hill i saw before me the
cause of all the trouble about two stads
ahead there rose a solid wall of vapor
stretching away to the horizon on each
side and to the silver clouds above and
giving forth such an intense heat in my
direction that i could scarcely bear it
every now and then a few drops of scald-
ing water would fall on me from above

  this must be the boiling sea of which
i had heard so much and which surrounds
all continental poros it was an impressive
sight

  the pale ended only about a stad ahead
and yet for the life of me i could not
summon up courage enough to try and
pass around its end in fact i could not
conceive how the wall ever could have
been built even that far in the face of
that terrific heat

  later i learned that it had been built
little by little behind a huge screen of
woven fire-worm fur and only during off-
shore breezes at that

well there was nothing for me to do
but turn around and retrace my steps back
to the valley of the howling rocks and


famous fantastic mysteries

beyond in search for an opening through
the wall

  my earthly ears caught the sound of an
approaching kerkool and as the road was
fortunately passing through the woods at
the time i hid myself in a convenient tar-
tan bush

  but this time i displaced one of the
huge leaves sufficiently so that with one
eye i could cover the road what was my
joy to note as the car passed that it was
of cupian make and held cupians

when the kerkool was safely out of
sight and hearing i resumed my
march and soon came in view of a city
of a type so different from any which i
had previously seen on poros that it might
well have belonged to another world

  i sat down in a hillside pasture beside
the road amidst gently grazing aphids
and gazed upon the beautiful sight the
city was set upon a rounded hill on the
very summit stood a group of monumental
white buildings ornamented with domes
minarets and stately columns from this
group down to the foot of the hill and
across the plain toward where i sat there
stretched a plaza of well kept silver sward
flanked by walks and ornamental trees

  the road ran square to the nearer edge
of this park where it forked abruptly and
skirted both sides of the lawn flanking
this divided road and extending around
the base of the hill stood a multitude of
houses gray concrete or stucco with high
pitched red tile roofs nothing more differ-
ent from the ant cities to which i was
accustomed could be imagined

  that i was at last in cupia the coun-
try of my princess there could now be no
question and as if to resolve my last
possible doubt night now fell and the
pink sky on my left assured me that i
was in truth north of the pale and that
the hated country of my captivity lay far
behind me

  as the silver gray faded overhead i
realized that i had had nothing to eat
since a condemned mans conventional
hearty meal early that morning so util-

  izing the few remaining minutes of day-
light i fashioned a tartan leaf into a rude
cup and filled it with green milk from the
contented cows

  then laying my weary body upon the
ground and covering myself with tartan
leaves i turned in for the night and slept
the healthy sleep of utter exhaustion

the next morning i awakened greatly
refreshed and after breakfasting
from the friendly aphids set off to enter
the beautiful city

  i	was badly in need of a shave and my
toga was mussed and soiled but my dis-
guise was still intact and without too much
scrutiny i might still pass as a cupian
yet i did not dare ask where i was not
knowing what the cupian customs might
be with regard to strangers

  my first desire was to procure a shav-
ing knife and a clean toga but i had no
idea how to go about it in formia there
had been no shops everything necessary
had simply been issued as in the army
but without even the need of signing a
receipt but quite likely the cupian cus-
tom was different

  then too i wanted lodgings and a job
but did not know how to go about this
either

  fortunately however i overheard a con-
versation between two cupians which gave
me a clue as to how to proceed

  yahoo jodek one of them hailed
the other how is it that you are in
kuana today

  my heart gave a bound kuana the
capital city of cupia and home of my
princess fate was indeed repaying me
well for all the hard knocks it had given
me

  the one addressed as jodek answered
i have walked in from ktuth to register
for a job here in kuana can you direct
me to the ministry of work

  and the two friends walked away chat-
ting together while the germ of an idea
sprouted in my mind i too would be from
ktuth looking for a job

  occasionally i passed some very offici-
the radioman

- 

ous looking person armed with a short
broadsword

  i assumed these were pinquis or poro-
vian policemen

  finally when i felt sure that jodek had
had plenty of time in which to report i
approached one of these policemen told
him that i was from ktuth and asked
him the way to the ministry of work

  too bad about all the trouble at ktuth
isnt it said he

  i assented vaguely

  do you think that it was the fault
of count kamel he continued

  he was getting entirely too garrulous
and was likely at any moment to trap me
into some damaging slip i was just about
to reply irrelevantly that duke lucky
strike was entirely to blame when whom
should i see walking down the street but
my enemy and betrayer yuri and at that
instant he too saw me

  let me digress for a moment i find that
in writing down this account of my adven-
tures i frequently use earth words instead
of the more exact porovian synonym thus
i have just said count and duke al-
though these words are not strictly ac-
curate i might have said barsarkar and
sarkar instead but i believe that a
clearer impression will be created on my 
readers-if this manuscript ever reaches
the earth-by occasionally using earth
words where this does not involve too great
a stretch in their meaning

  well as i was saying here to my sur-
prise and horror came the last person on
poros whom i desired to see namely prince
yuri each of us was equally astonished
to see the other but yuri was the first
to recover his presence of mind

  pinqui he shouted peremptorily to
the cupian policeman arrest that man
and take him to the mang-ool i myself
will answer to the mango and tell the
mango that i forbid conversation with
the prisoner

  then turning to me with a smile yuri
remarked

 welcome to kuana my friends you
are as welcome here as a spot of sunlight

and have just as bad a habit of turning
up the last i heard of you you were con-
demned to death how you escaped from
the ant-men i know not but perhaps you
will find that cupian justice is surer than
formian

  then to the officer as i started to re-
ply pinqui if he says a word to me to
you or to any one strike him on the an-
tennae i have spoken

  and he strode majestically away as the
pinqui seized me roughly by the arm and
led me to the mang-ool or jail of the city
of kuana

  at the mang-ool the pinqui turned me
over to the mango to whom he repeated
yuris message whereupon i noticed a pe-
culiar yindictive expression creep across
the jailers face

  then i was led to a cell and locked in
once more i was out of luck a few min-
utes ago i had been free and full of joy
at finding myself in the city of my prin-
cess now i was in the toils again and-
what was worse-in the power of the man
who was my deadly rival for lilias hand
and who for aught that i knew was al-
ready betrothed to her

  at all events he was the most powerful
single individual in all cupia next to his
uncle the king

  i was certainly in a jam and to make
matters worse my jailer evidently a thor-
oughly vicious personality

chapter xii

a victim of yuri

but the malevolence of the jailer was
not directed against me for as he
turned away after locking me in my cell
he softly radiated the joyous information
any one who is an enemy of prince yuri
has nothing to fear from poblath

  then he was gone evidently in spite
of yuris popularity there were some
cupians who saw through him and pob-
lath the mango must be one of these
shortly afterwards he returned with food
and spoke softly as he placed it before me

 walls have antennae  he said so


famous fantastic mysteries

i will not radiate loujly to you be dis-
creet do nothing to anger yuri bide your
time and if  can be of any particular
service let me know common enmity
maketh close friends 

  evidently poblath was greatly given to
porovian proverbs

  about one parth or porovian hour
later the mango brought prince yuri to
my cell yuri had come to gloat over me
and to give in my presence his directions
for my discomfiture

  poblath he declared this man cabot
is a dangerous criminal the charges
against him are so serious that i must lay
them in person before king kew cabot
is a deaf-mute born without antennae
but he has concocted with diabolical
cleverness some artificial electrical an-
tennae no one is to be permitted to talk
with him and to make sure of this i
now command you to take from him his
apparatus

  my jaw dropped with horror at the
thought but the jailer quickly came to my
rescue

  oh sire he said the ancient law i
will see that no communication is had with
him but the ancient law prohibits de-
priving any person of his antennae

  yuri replied this is not a person it
is an animal and furthermore his appara-
tus is not antennae strictly speaking
problath was equal to the occasion the
ancient law applies equally to animals as
you well know my prince and as for
his antennae they are antennae to me un-
less king kew rules otherwise

  leave his antennae then snapped
yuri and remove his belt

  but poblath was obdurate and stood
upon his rights if his belt serves his an-
tennae i demand a kingly ruling i have
spoken

  yuri scowled

  a ruling you shall have he gritted as
he turned away meanwhile keep the
prisoner by himself

  your will is law poblath answered
with mock meekness

  so at last i had a friend in cupia when

the mango returned to bring me my supper
i determined to take him into my confi-
dence

  poblath i said as a feeler who res-
cued the princess lilia from the form-
ians

  it was prince yuri he replied it is
the one decent act of his life though his
beautiful cousin does not seem to be par-
ticularly grateful to him for it

  then she is not yet betrothed to him
i asked

  not yet nor ever was the emphatic
answer

  poblath i declared yuri did not
rescue- the princess i did it can you get
word to her that i am here

  by the blue-horned woofus he ejacu-
lated can i just watch me

  if you straighten this out i said i
shall be most eternally grateful

  at which the mango quoted sententi-
ously he who expects gratitude hath not
conferred a favor  then he hurried away

  late that evening he returned to my
cell with a most exquisite specimen of
cupian femininity whom he introduced as
bthuh maid in waiting to princess lilia

  if lilia was all that was desirable in
a blonde bthuh was all that was desirable
in a brunette full lips clear olive skin
dark languorous eyes a seductive form
a chestnut baby-doll with smoldering
southern passion underneath she was a
red rose overripe although my allegiance
never wavered for an instant from the
lovely lilia yet i must confess that the
presence of this exotic beauty strangely
stirred me and she smiled at me as though
she thought me not half bad either

  then she spoke i am betrothed to
poblath although secretly because my
rank of sarkari duchess should prevent
an alliance with a commoner that brink
this was a particularly choice epithet to
apply to yuri for brink is the name of
the little hopping lizard that infests the
concrete roads-that brink has been try-
ing to make love to me though in a most
unflattering way in spite of my rank his
standing is such that i dare not oppose
the radio man



him openly but poblath and i are friends
of yours since you are an enemy of our
enemy you may tell us your story with-
out fear

so i told them in detail my entire ad-
ventures on this planet from my find-
ing myself beside the silver lake on the
day of the explosion in my boston labora-
tory down to date omitting of course the
more intimate passages between myself and
the princess lilia when i finished i
could see that i was assured of their co-
operation not only because of our com-
mon hatred of prince yuri but also be-
cause of the merits of my own case

  the next step poblath announced
is for bthuh to tell her mistress that you
are here once the princess knows this we
can be sure that she will confide in bthuh
and thus we can leajn definitely where
matters stand

  then the two lovers withdrew leaving
me to spend a far happier night than i
had had any reason to expect

  the next day passed uneventfully evi-
dently yuri was having some difficulty in
getting his desired ruling from the king
relative to my antennae

  nightfall again brought with it the dark
and beautiful bthuh to her tryst with
the mango poblath and bthuh brought
news of the princess who sent word to me
to be of good cheer for her father the
king was to inspect the kuana jail on
the morrow

  just what good this would do me i
could not see but i took lilias word for
it that this was good tidings

  preparatory to the visit i obtained ma-
terials from poblath and shaved

  on the next day the third day of my
imprisonment kew xii king of cupia
attended by his suite inspected the kuana
jail and in due course was conducted to
my cell the king was a broad shouldered
narrow hipped athletic figure looking like
a well preserved earth-man of about fifty
years of age his complexion was bronzed
his nose slightly aquiline and his hair iron
gray short and furry his eyes were btck

and piercing and his mouth and jaw firm
justice but not mercy sat upon his kingly
brow

  he and i studied each other calmly for
a few moments and then i lost my calm
for in the royal suite stood my princess
i was about to cry out to her when her
expression stayed me so instead i merely
acknowledged her presence with a bow
and said my life is as ever at the
service of the princess lilia

  whereat the king turned to his daugh-
ter and asked who is this man who
seems to know you and who claims the
honor of being a servitor of the royal
house

  but before she could answer one of the
suite stepped forward and declared i
know the prisoner sire and he is none
other than myles cabot a great scientist
from the planet minos recently feasted
and honored at the university of formia
surely his imprisonment must be a mis-
take

  my new defender was the cupian pro-
fessor who had stood at the head table at
the banquet in my honor my first night in
mooni

  then declared the king this must
be the cabot of whom prince yuri spoke
urging us to consent that he be deprived
of his artificial antennae a great scientist
he must be to have designed such an ap-
paratus but yuri assures us that he is
likewise a great criminal and a dangerous
enemy of the kew dynasty of which facts
yuri has promised us full particulars
shortly speak man and tell us your ver-
sion of your crimes

  i hesitated but the princess answered
my unspoken thought my good fellow
you need not fear to tell everything to my
father the king

  so i told i told the whole story of my
life on poros omitting nothing except my
love for the princess lilia it was nearly
a whole parth in the telling and all those
present hung on every word

  when i was done the king amazed
turned to his daughter and inquired can
this be true is the crown prince such a


famous fantastic mysteries

scoundrel that he would abduct the prin-
cess royal and then falsely claim the credit
for her rescue

  to which lilia replied i know noth-
ing of prince yuris complicity in my ab-
duction though it seems to fit in with his
other acts but i do know that he has
claimed undeserved credit which is an un-
forgivable breach of the cupian ethics of
fair play

  the king called to one of his courtiers
go forthwith and order the prince to
repair immediately to our quarters we
shall sift this matter to the bottom and
-turning on me-if your story proves
false it will go hard with you but if your
story proves to be true it will go hard
with prince yuri

  and he swept from my presence fol-
lowed by his suite and last of all by the
princess lilia who turned and smiled
sweetly on me just as she was leaving

no further word came from the
palace all that day but late that
afternoon prince yuri visited the jail with
a number of his courtiers he was furi-
ously angry poblatli was with him en-
deavoring to calm him down and to divert
him from seeing me but yuri was insistent

  as the door of my cell was flung open
the prince started to abuse me

  how dare you malign a member of the
ruling house he thundered how dare
you lie and involve the princess lilia in
your lies i have a mind to kill you on
the spot and thus rid the planet of your
foul presence

  and he would have gone on if i had not
had a sudden inspiration

  yuri said i you woofus brink
mathlab ill-get-your-number

  the effect was electrical the princes
face went white with rage then he calmed
and a smile overspread his face

  pardon me sir but ill get yours he
replied with a low bow

  poblath interjected you poor fool
cabot prince yuri is the best duelist in
all cupia

   a brink may hop once too often be-

neath the kerkool  i quoted but come
i see that we do not rush at each other
as they do in formia what are supposed
to -be the formalities here

  you will learn soon enough yuri
growled scowling ominously

  but poblath more kindly explained
each of you chooses an attendant and
then the attendants tie you together and
you kill with knives

  this reminded me of mark twains
gattling guns at fifteen paces i chose
poblath and yuri chose one of his own
suite a peculiar harness was then pro-
duced consisting of a double belt one
half of this was buckled around yuris
waist but when they came to buckle me
into the other half my radio apparatus
which was concealed beneath my toga
furnished an obstacle and so there was
nothing for me to do but take it off this
of course would render me entirely deaf
during the fight which fact might prove
somewhat disadvantageous

  but before they took away my hearing
they explained fully to me just how the
duel would be conducted and i cautioned
poblath to keep a firm hold of my appara-
tus and not to let it get into the hands oi
any of yuris henchmen even for an in-
stant

  otherwise i said the ancient law
might easily become violated

  then i shed my antennae and stood
once more an earth-man ready to battle
for my existence against the inhabitants of
poros

  we were belted together face to face
waist touching waist each of us held a
short sharp dagger in his left hand-
cupians being a left-handed race-while
the right hand of each of us seized the left
wrist of his opponent the idea was for
me to try and stab yuri to death before
he could stab me and vice versa

  yuri had the advantage on the offensive
for he held his dagger in his strong hand
whereas i held mine in my weak but
conversely i had the advantage on the
defensive for it was my strongest hand
which warded him off
the radio man

- 

  no spoken signal could be given be-
cause of my receiving set being off so
poblath held up his hand and both of us
watched it then when he let it fall we
started to wrestle

  yuri might be the most perfect physical
specimen in all cupia but i was from a
planet where the greater attraction of
gravity necessitated a greater strength on
the average however i soon perceived
that these porovian duels are not to be
won by strength alone there were tricks
and feints by which ones opponent could
be tired out and i was a mere novice
while yuri was regarded as the most expert
duelist on all poros

  we tumbled and rolled about the floor
with first his knife and then mine near its
mark at last we both struggled to our
feet again and swayed back and forth for
a moment

  and then gradually yuris dagger be-
gan to descend strain as i would i could
not stay its slow and steady progress to-
ward my heart a gleam of exultation filled
the eye of my opponent the point of
his knife pricked my breast and began to
enter in a few seconds it would be over
and i should fall a victim of an alien race

  a strange train of ideas ran through my
affrighted mind alien race japanese
jujitsu the very thing the ulnar nerve

  suddenly shifting my grip on his wrist

i forced my thumb into the sensitive spot
and instantly his knife about to pierce
my heart dropped instead from his nerve-
less fingers and clattered harmlessly to the
floor

  and now what was the etiquette of the
situation

  i turned my glance from yuris eyes
to those of poblath and saw the latter
frantically motioning me to kill to kill -
nothing would give me greater pleasure

  but as i returned to the task i noted
the princess lilia standing in the crowd
with a look of terror on her face her ap-
pealing eyes showed that she was speaking
to me probably urging me to spare the
prince

  so she cared for the scoundrel after all

  in disgust i threw my own knife into

a corner and signaled to poblath to re-
move the belts he did so reproachfully
and then handed me my receiving set

  something prompted me to put it on in
haste and it is well that i did so for as
i snapped the ear phones in place i heard
yuri shout quick two of you cover
cabot and the mango

  instantly each of us was forced to the
wall with a sharp broadsword at our
breast while yuri seized the princess and
surrounded by the rest of his suite made
a hasty exit from the cell room

chapter xiii

kidnaped

as yuri surrounded by his body-
guard dragged princess lilia from
the room i had an inspiration i remem-
bered the superstitious legend about me
which prevailed among the farmer ants of
formia

  halt  i shouted my electrical an-
tennae can kill as well as radiate speech
let no man move a foot if he would es-
cape the lightnings of heaven which i
have power to loose upon you

  the whole party stopped dead in their
tracks and watched me fascinated

  drop your points i ordered the two
who guarded poblath and me quick be-
fore i blast you

  they obeyed and i walked fearlessly
across the room

  let one man stir and you all die i
continued as i pushed between the guards
and wrenched the princess from her
cousins nerveless arms now out of here
all of you 

  in sheer relief like men awakened from
a trance they bolted through the door

  fine work poblath remarked him-
self greatly relieved but you should have
detained them all as prisoners

  good riddance of bad rubbish i re-
plied and besides who knows how soon
one of them might have moved and not
have been blasted and thus have spoiled
my entire bluff 

  the princess clung to my arms then
raising her eyes to mine with a smile she


famous fantastic mysteries

said again you have saved me myles
cabot and again i am yours

  and i am always yours my princess
i replied

  she stamped her foot then said sadly
ever you remind me that i am a princess
and as a princess i must demand more
respect from you myles cabot

  gently i released her and she linger-
ingly departed leaving me alone with
poblath i felt let down and futile the
victim of an anticlimax what next

  and then ensued a period of waiting
days passed and i still remained an in-
mate of the kuana jail no word from
princess lilia no word from king kew
no word of prince yuri although rumor
had it that he had fled into formia fear-
ing the wrath of the king

  i heard that a group of the younger
politicians in the popular assembly headed
by prince toron had suggested to the
king that he demand an apology from
queen formis for the first abduction of
the princess and that he demand extra-
dition of yuri on the charge of attempting
the second

  but king kew was in a ticklish posi-
tion being the ruler of a subject race and
holding his position merely by grace of
formis whom he hated as she well knew
if he were to present any such demand
as this the least which he could expect
would be an immediate counterdemand for
my surrender formis might demand his
abdication in favor of yuri even war
might result which the- cupians were un-
armed to resist this would mean tons of
explosives dropped upon kuana from for-
mian airplanes thousands of cupians
ground between fierce mandibles and then
another treaty more degrading even than
that of mooni

  so king kew resorted to diplomacy
rather than to ultimatums and finally
reached a tacit understanding whereby
queen formis disclaimed responsibility for
the kidnaping and made a gift to the prin-
cess lilia and whereby prince yuri was
permitted to remain undisturbed in for-
mia and i in cupia

  now upon the consummation of the
agreement between the two countries i
was let out of prison and conducted to
theroyal palace where i was received in
honor by the king and princess the palace
was one of the monumental white build-
ings on the brow of the hill around which
the city of kuana is built the rest of
the group being the university

  lilia greeted me cordially as an old
friend but of course in the presence of
the king neither of us dared show any
stronger sentiments

  king kew patted me warmly on the
cheek		t

  well done myles cabot he declared
we welcome to kuana the scientist of
minos formis by her treachery has lost
your great abilities and cupia is the
gainer thereby the old hag may gnash
her mandibles in vain but-

  father father interjected the prin-
cess remonstratingly do be careful re-
member that you occupy your throne
merely by the grace of the conquerors
and by the disgrace of my ancestors
he added grimacing

  but father she continued  walls
have antennae even now word of your
utterances may be on the way to the im-
perial city and she laid her golden curly
head beguilingly on his broad shoulder

  somewhat mollified the king mur-
mured i know i know and i must be
careful but the enslavement of my peo-
ple irks me even though i spring from a
line of eleven servile kings would that
there were some way of striking off the
yoke and ridding the face of poros of
these beasts with human minds and woofus
hearts 

  spoken like a king i cried know
then king kew and princess lilia that
if ever such a day comes myles cabot
can be counted on to fight in the van-
guard of the army of liberation

  brave words lilia replied in a sub-
dued tone but foolish as well we are
only brinks formis is a woofus and it is
futile to struggle against fate

  she sighed
the radio man

  



  kew sat down heavily on his throne and
put his head in his hands i considered
it tactful to withdraw

quarters were found for me near
by the palace and the ministry of
work assigned me for my two parths a
day to the machine shop of the depart-
ment of mechanics at the university
tickets were issued to me as an advance
on my pay and this enabled me to make
many necessary purchases from the gov-
ernment shops to replace the articles bor-
rowed during my incarceration in the mang-
ool and to buy presents for poblath and
his fiancee among my purchases was the
most elaborate and expensive silk toga
which i could obtain in the city so as to
enhance my standing and dignity at court
functions

  a few days after my release the king
honored me with an invitation to dinner
with him and the princess alone and this
was followed within a few days by a ban-
quet to some of the leading nobles-sar-
kars and barsarkars--and professors of
the university-babbuhs

  on this latter occasion i met the cupian
professor who had stood at the head table
at the banquet at mooni and who had
later identified and befriended me at the
kuana jail he was hah babbuh pro-
fessor of mechanics head of the depart-
ment to which i was attached

  he now sat at my right and we speedily
became great friends a fact which was
shortly to play an important part in my
life and in the history of the whole planet

  it was on his recommendation that i
had been assigned to his department by
the minister of work

  time sped rapidly during the succeeding
days my duties which consisted in ma-
chine design were interesting though a
bit out of my line of the twelve parths
which make up a porovian day about four
were required for sleep and only two for
work thus leaving six the equivalent of
nearly twelve earth hours for meals and
recreation

  recreation is the chief vocation of

cupia and is conducted under the direc-
tion of the minister of play who is the
most important member of the kings
cabinet

  i was duly assigned to a hundred or
athletic club consisting normally of one
hundred and forty-seven members under
the leadership of an elective pootah as-
sisted by two bar-pootahs the hundreds
are grouped together by twelves into
thousands each led by an elective eklat
and so the grouping continues on the anal-
ogy of the defunct armies of the cupian
nations which existed prior to the great
war of the formian conquest as i have
already intimated a similar organization
obtains in the imperial air navy of the
ant-men

  the games are mostly athletic in their
nature consisting in running jumping
throwing stones at a mark strap-dueling
with blunt knives dipped in pitch wrestl-
ing et cetera sons normally enter their
fathers hundred as soon as there is a va-
cancy and wives and daughters are or-
ganized into auxiliary hundreds teams
representing each hundred compete an-
nually within their thousand the winning
teams compete within their regiment and
so on up badges are awarded to the final
winners and a special prize to the hundred
whose members capture the most badges
then there is competitive marching in
complicated evolutions in squads of twelve
conducted by each hundred as a whole

  this organized recreation is entirely op-
tional except as to the marching which
in my hundred occurred only twice a
sangth ie every sixty days so i had
plenty of time to spend as i saw fit i
made frequent visits to the department
of electricity and became quite intimate
with its professor oya buh

  i also became acquainted with ja bab-
buh professor of mathematics

  the observatory fascinated me never
for a moment is the huge telescope with
its revolving cylinder of mercury left
unguarded here sits constantly buh tedn
or one of his assistants while four students
scan the sky for an occasional rift in the


famous fantastic mysteries

clouds this vigil maintained throughout
the ages and a similar vigil at mooni have
resulted in a knowledge of space compar-
able with ours in spite of the clouds which
envelope poros the porovians have long
been of the opinion that both mars and
the earth are inhabited but that the
other planets are not

  constant demands were made on me to
lecture before the students and to submit
to physical examinations but as all this
came during my work time it did not in-
terfere with my recreation

  the wing of the palace devoted to lilia
and her attendants lay near to my quar-
ters and not far from the machine shop
and could be reached by an outside door
without passing through the rest of the
palace thither i came as a frequent
visitor by invitation of the princess in
fact to be perfectly frank i spent nearly
my entire spare time there

  she had an unquenchable sunny dispo-
sition and a keen sense of humor she had
no particular accomplishments and yet
possessed that trait often overlooked and
yet more valuable than any mere parlor
tricks of tactfulness sympathy ability to
smooth over the rough places of life and
to enrich with her personality every gather-
ing which she favored with her presence

  i certainly was on the top of the world
-or rather of the planet poros-and to
make my contentment complete my old
ant friend doggo was detailed as attache
of the formian ambassador and brought
with him my pet buntlote and lilias pet
mathlab which we had left behind in
wautoosa

meanwhile my scientific attain-
ments were attracting considerable
attention until finally lilia informed me
that her father had reached the conclusion
that these attainments would furnish an
excuse for elevating me to the lesser no-
bility the real basis for my elevation was
of course my rescue of the princess but
the king had not dared to give this rea-
son for fear of offending the sensibilities
of queen formis

  in due course of time my promotion
occurred and i became a barsarkar en-
titled to wear a red circle over where my
heart ought to be i e on the right side
of my toga

  lilia gave a special dinner to celebrate
this and invited bthuh and poblath in
fact she was always getting up special
occasions on one pretext or another for
she was very fond of devising new ways
of cooking alta and mathlab and the red
lobsterlike aphid-parasite and of trying
these dishes on her friends

  we played at a four-handed game re-
sembling checkers and a pleasant time was
had by all after the game we sat on a
little veranda in the warm soft evening air
two pairs of lovers blissfully happy

  doggo had not been invited he would
not have fitted in being a sexless female
what could he know of love and then
too i had begun to learn that except in
educational circles where science knows
no national boundaries there was very
little fraternizing between the cupians and
their conquerors the social barrier be-
tween doggo and me which resembled the
pale between our two countries was the
only drawback to an otherwise idyllic
life

  but as poblath would say the cloud-
iest day may have its sunshine meaning
just the opposite toour every cloud has
its silver lining for one day i received
a letter from king kew announcing as a
special mark of his favor my betrothal to
-the duchess bthuh

  horrified i rushed to the apartments
of my princess and obtained entrance
she too had heard the news and was
in tears

  my rank or not bthuh or no bthuh
you are mine mine she sobbed as she
clung to me while i covered her with
kisses if it were not for yuri and your
criminal record we could flee into
formia but here in cupia my father is
supreme if you were still a commoner
you could marry or not as you chose
within your own class but as a barsarker
you must marry as the king directs
the radio man



  isnt there anything we can do about
it i demanded

  nothing she replied a princess can-
not marry lower than a full sarkar which
is a rank that you can attain only by
performing some distinguished service for
your country our only hope lies in ac-
cepting our fate for the present and in
striving to get you a sarkarship before
the wedding and think of poor bthuh
this will be as much of a blow to her and
to poblath as it is to us

  but to our surprise and consternation
bthuh took the news very philosophically

  the kings will be done said she with
a pretty little pout and shrug myles
cabot is not a bad match after all and
if rank prevents him from having the
princess and prevents me from having
the mango why not solace ourselves with
each other

  and she glanced shyly up at me

  but somehow the idea did not appeal
to me at all

  i must have looked at bthuh with much
the same expression of horror as the prin-
cess had worn the day of our first meet-
ing at wautoosa when i was still an un-
kempt earth man for bthuh laughed and
said come come myles do not look
thus am i so horrible that you cannot
learn to love me even to please our gra-
cious king

  bthuh stop that foolishness at once
ordered lilia you make me sick

  but bthuh insolently replied cannot
i flirt with my own betrothed o princess
she left the rqom smiling

  she is merely trying to hide a broken
heart i apologized

  whereat lilia wheeled on me furiously
and said dont you dare stand up for
that creature

  so i desisted

  i certainly was in a fix engaged -to
a girl whom i did not love but who had
apparently determined to put up with me
estranged from the girl whom i did love
forced to play false with the first man
who had befriended me in cupia awd no
way out in sight what was i to do

  i thought of renouncing my rank but
this i found was impossible and be-
sides such a step would put the princess
even further out of my reach

  bthuh bore up nobly much too nobly
in fact

  poblath sent me a brief note reading
i expected no gratitude but i did expect
a square deal and then refused to re-
ceive me when i hastened to the mang-ool
to explain

  i took hah babbuh into my confidence
but he had no suggestion to offer for i
had as yet done nothing to deserve a sar-
karship

  as time passed i saw less and less of
lilia and more and more of bthuh but
i managed to keep from being left alone
with the latter

  the date for our wedding was set and
drew nearer and nearer we were to be
married in state by the king himself i
could not help admitting that my bride was
an exquisite creature but i did not could
not love her though if i had never met
the princess lilia i could doubtless have
lived very happily with bthuh but how
can the eagles lover mate with a para-
keet

  at last the eve of my wedding arrived
after supper i dragged my footsteps to
the quarters of the princess to spend with
her the last few parths which i should
ever be free to spend for on the morrow
i was to become a married man bthuh my
affianced bride met me and the princess
was nowhere to be seen

  oh cabot cabot entreated bthuh
as she seized my hands and gazed into my
eyes cannot you bow to the inevitable
is life with me such a horrible fate i can
be very sweet if you will but let me try
you have never once kissed me yet is
that the way to treat your betrothed
kiss me cabot kiss me kiss me kiss
me

  and still holding me with her amber
eyes she slid her hands up my arms and
drew her fragrant presence close to me

  but i broke away abruptly from her
spell and demanded where is my prin-


famous fantastic mysteries

cess surely you will not rob me of my
last few hours of freedom

  bthuh shrugged her pretty shoulders
your princess it is always your prin-
cess well what should i care for tomor-
row you are mine wholly mine and even
a princess will not pirate the husband of
a sarkari find her yourself and gather
flowers while it yet is day and with an-
other shrug she left the salon

  tomorrow why tomorrow i may be
myself with yesterdays seven thousand
years i quoted softly as i pulled the sig-
nal cord for the maid

  the maid informed me that her mistress
had not been seen since early morning it
was not like lilia thus to leave her where-
abouts unknown for such a long time in-
stantly i suspected foul play so i rushed
out into the streets and began to make in-
quiries

  if i had been less agitated i suppose
that i would have been more systematic
but as it was i soon learned from a
pinqui that the princess had been seen
walking southward over the plaza shortly
before noon so i hastened down to the
plaza and started questioning people

  at last my search was rewarded for
several people reported that they had seen
a woman apparently much agitated picked
up by an ant-man and carried southward
so hiring a kerkool at the nearest garage
i started in pursuit

  a few stads outside the city i came
upon an ant kerkool lying beside the road
gyroscope trouble evidently i parked my
car and got out to investigate

  as i was standing there gazing at the
fallen kerkool a bandage was suddenly
thrown around my eyes from behind then
i smelled the pungent anaesthetic fumes
of decoction of saffra root and my
struggles ceased

chapter xiv

in disgrace

i awakened to find myself lying
bound in a wood the time was appar-
ently the next morning my first thought

was to worry about lilia my next was
to wonder who was to blame for my
seizure yuri undoubtedly

  but if so had he not misplayed if
he had let me alone i should by this
time be marrying the sarkari bthuh and
once married to her i coidd no longer in-
terfere between lilia and yuri who might
even consent to marry the princess out
of pique

  my thoughts were interrupted by the
return of my captor who proved to be
an ant-man numbered -- he was
a young ant and bore no duel numbers
i started to speak but he warned me to
be silent to make sure of my obedience
he bit me savagely once more as on my
first day on this planet i experienced in-
tense pain followed by oblivion and then
by conscious paralysis

  when i awoke paralyzed i found that
my captor was carrying me the fact that
he was an ant-man confirmed my suspi-
cions of yuri but the fact that he was
carrying me furtively through the woods
instead of on the main highway convinced
me that i was still in cupia

  my bonds were still on but had become
very loose immediately i decided that my
one chance of escape lay in concealing my
recovery from the paralysis when this re-
covery should occur so i awaited my op-
portunity

  thus we proceeded for about a parth
and a half when suddenly my  captor
halted and pricked up his antennae i too
listened directly ahead of us there came
a long-drawn howl the call of a woofus
nearer came the sound

  we were in a field at the time and i
could see that the ant-man was looking
around for a likely tree in which to take
refuge but the bordering woods were all
scrub with not a single sizable tree in
sight so my captor laid me down and ad-
vanced toward the sound of the oncoming
woofus evidently determined to bluff it
out and to attack before being attacked

  then the purple terror bounded into the
open one lone ant-man is no match for
a woofus my captor fought bravely but


the radio man



he was slowly driven back contesting
every parastad of the way when the two
were nearly upon me i realized that my
languor was gone i undid my bonds i
stood erect then i found a heavy stick

  my captor was entirely engrossed in
his conflict now was my chance to crush
him with my club and then escape while
the woofus devoured his remains fate was
indeed kind to me once more so i crept
stealthily forward and then brought my
club down with a crash on the head of-

  the woofus for my sense of fair play
my sporting sense had abruptly changed
my mind and i had rescued the under-
dog instead of killing him now i was
again his captive undoubtedly destined this
time to have eggs laid in me by queen
formis

 the ant-man stood for a moment
astounded and then wheeled around i
still held my club there was now no rea-
son why i should not kill him too if i
could but he did not charge

  instead he said let us not fight you
have saved my life and so i owe you
yours a life for a life no one shall ever
say that -- is ungrateful go in
peace look a mist approaches my excuse
shall be that i lost you in the fog if
you too are grateful you will tell the
same story

  then the fog a frequent phenomenon
of poros closed upon me and i saw my
captor no more i lay down covered my-
self with tartan leaves to keep off the
wet and waited for the fog to lift

  and the next thing i knew it was morn-
ing

  in spite of my long fast-since supper
two days ago-i felt refreshed by my sleep
and at once set out through the woods
in as nearly a straight line as i could in
the hope of striking a road the straight
line was easy as the eastern sky was still
faintly pink and likewise it was easy
to head north along the road when i
finally reached one but when at last i
came to a city it turned out to be ktuth
rather than kuana	r

before seeking food or anything else
except a much-needed drink of water
i found a pinqui and asked him if he had
heard any recent news from kuana rela-
tive to the disappearance of the princess

  news from kuana disappearance
he repeated in surprise surely not the
princess has been here safe and sound for
two days and left only a few paraparths
ago by the kuana road

  so i had just missed her if i had en-
tered the city a bit later i should have
passed her on the road

  my tickets were not sufficient to hire
a kerkool and besides now that i knew
lilia was safe i was in no hurry to face
bthuh whom i had left waiting at the
joining-stand as it were so after break-
fast i set out on foot for kuana thirty
stads away carrying some lunch

  around noon when i had just eaten
my lunch on a stone by the side of the
road a kerkool passed me headed for
kuana i hailed its single occupant and
was given a lift the rest of the way he
turned out to be the chief of pinquis of
the ktuth bound for a conference with
the mango of kuana i welcomed the
chance to get inside the kuana jail face
to face with my old friend poblath for
this opportunity would enable me to give
him my long-deferred explanation of my
relations-or rather lack of relations-
with his bthuh

  it was three days since i had shaved
and i must have presented an uncanny
sight in fact the chief had intimated
as much as i got aboard his kerkool so
when poblath saw me his jaw dropped
and he seemed convulsed with fear

  go away dead man he begged i
confess it all i did hire the ant-man to
assassinate you but now that you have
my confession return in peace to the land
beneath the boiling seas and leave me
alone 

  so that was why i had been kidnaped
well at least it let yuri out of being an
absolute fool

  poblath old friend i replied i am


famous fantastic mysteries

not dead the ant-man lost me in the fog
and i have returned not to curse you but
rather to thank you for you have saved
me from an unwished marriage

  and then i got across the explanation
which he had so long denied me when i
had finished there was no longer any doubt
in poblaths mind that i was still his
friend and he warmly patted my jaw the
conventional porovian token of friendship

  but i fancied that his sweetheart bthuh
would not be so easy to appease

  from the jail i went to my rooms for
a shave and a clean toga and then re-
paired to the garage where i had rented
the kerkool my intention being to try and
arrange to pay for the loss on the install-
ment plan

  but to my surprise the kerkooloolo in-
formed me that my kerkool had been
found with its gyros still running stand-
ing beside the wrecked ant-car and had
been brought back to kuana intact so
that all i owed was an extra days rent
for which he would gladly trust me until
next ticket-day

  on returning again to my rooms i found
a messenger with a peremptory summons
to attend the king forthwith in spite of
the fact that it was now nearly time for
the evening meal evidently old kew had
heard of my return

  he had when i entered the audience
chamber i entered the presence of an
awful wrath kew was seated on his royal
couch and standing beside him was a
shee-woofus named bthuh never before
had i so stirred a womans rage and i
hope never to do so again

  the king demanded an explanation
which i gave readily enough but which
did not convince him in the least

  cabot barsarkar he spoke i do
not believe you concern for the safety of
the princess is very commendable but if
it were that which actuated you you would
have inquired first from me and would
have learned that she had left a note with
me giving word of her departure for
ktuth

  no you took the absence of the prin-

cess as a mere convenient excuse to desert
your bride at the joining-stand unmind-
ful of-the high honor which i was con-
ferring on you in giving the hand of a
sarkari to you lately a commoner nay
even a beast from another world whether
or not she will still have you is for the
lady to say but as for me you have
greatly incurred the royal displeasure and
i am almost minded to revoke your rank
you came to us from among those ac-
cursed formians under whose thraldom
i am chafing verily i believe the ancient
proverb no good cometh out of formia
go i have spoken

  but  have not spoken interjected
bthuh ever the disrespectful know
base earth-thing that no one can injure
the pride of bthuh with impunity you
who could have given me your love or
even merely your hand and have received
in return a love the passion of which is
unequaled on this planet chose instead to
mete out to me who am your social su-
perior the worst insult which a man can
give to a woman

  i condescend to link myself with a
commoner and for reward am treated as
dirt am ground under heel like a brink
never can you wipe out this insult never
shall i reconsider my present determina-
tion not to marry you

  for this relief much thanks said i
to myself

  but you still have me to cope with
she continued you brink mathlab
earth-man

  a particularly delicate touch putting
earth-man as the climax of a list of
distasteful creatures

  bthuh will have her revenge she con-
cluded never fear now i have spoken
i drew a long breath as one who has
just finished receiving a flogging so that
was over the lady is now a very good
friend of mine and begs me to tone down
this transcription of her tirade but why
not tell the story just as it happened

  as i respectfully withdrew from the
udience chamber an attendant softly
radiated into my antennae that the prin-
the radio man

- 

cess desired to see me at once in her apart-
ments more trouble

  but i was wrong for lilia received me
most tenderly and graciously supper was
laid for two i took her in my arms

at last we seated ourselves side by
side on a couch by the table and
the meal was served

  i was unable to bear your marriage
to another she explained especially as
you did not seem to be trying to do any-
thing about it

  but how can a mathlab struggle in the
jaws of a woofus i interjected quoting
one of poblaths proverbs

  lilia smiled indulgently and continued
her story there was no one here whom
i could trust so i finally called upon
doggo he met me on the outskirts of the
city and carried me to ktuth in his ker-
kool then returned to kuana to try and
devise with you some means of escaping
from bthuh but his kerkool broke down
en route and he had to continue on foot
and by the time that he reached the city
you had disappeared when you failed to
show up for the wedding bthuh acted
like one drunk with saffra-root and has
continued so ever since doggo sent word
to me at ktuth and i returned

  theft i told her of my adventures she
sympathizing tenderly with my misfor-
tunes and thrilling at my conquest of the
woofus

  now that poblath is our friend again
we have little to fear from bthuh she
said bthuh is a mad little wanton and
will cool off if let alone but poblath for
all his philosophy is a commoner and
so was to have been expected to misun-
derstand the situation

  i wanted to say that lilia herself had
entertained exactly the same misunder-
standing as poblath but instead i merely
remarked i too am a commoner lilia
dearest

  you are not she indignantly replied
you are a barsarkar and have the heart
of a king could the princess lilia-love a
commoner

  the princess lilia once spent a whole

night in the arms of a commoner i
remonstrated

  and was just as safe and free from in-
sult as she would have been in the arms
of her mother she added but yuri be-
lieved otherwise or said that he did and
threatened that unless i would by my
silence assent to his version of my rescue
he would tell the king who would have
believed the worst and would have cast
me out so as long as i thought that you
were hopelessly doomed i held my peace
but i was very sad

  after the meal lilia and i sat for a long
time together on her little balcony dis-
cussing plans

  i shall marry you assented my prin-
cess even if we have to flee together to
islands beyond the boiling seas

  that was all very well but quite im-
practical the boiling seas were impas-
sable-unapproachable even formia was
barred to us by my criminal record and
by the presence and influence there of
yuri cupia was barred to us by the wrath
of king kew due to my treatment of his
favorite and formia and cupia consti-
tuted the entire world for us to hide dis-
guised was impossible because of my own
earth born deformities

  so although i gloried in lilias love
my joy was sobered by a realization that
marriage between us was impossible

  and what about the situation when king
kew should die and prince yuri should
succeed to the crown we had that to
look forward to

chapter xv

a new game

but with lilias love and trust i could
not despair as i kissed her good
night with her warm throbbing girlish
body held fast in my arms a singe star
shone down upon us for an instant
through a rift in the circumambient clouds
was it my own planet the earth i won-
dered

  during the succeeding days i saw much
of lilia and nothing of bthuh and ever
i racked my brains for an idea which


famous fantastic mysteries

should point the way out of my difficulties
my only hope was to perform such a dis-
tinguished service for my adopted coun-
try that the king would relent would for-
give me and would promote me to the rank
of sarkar

  the most distinguished service which a
cupian can render is to invent a new and
popular game so i set about to do some-
thing in that line and at last the idea
came a whiz of an idea as hah babbuh
head of the department of mechanics had
advised me to seek this means of distinc-
tion so it was to him that i first confided
my plans

  at my request prince toron who had
aided me so efficiently in devising my radio
set in the laboratories of mooni was de-
tailed to assist me in this new endeavor
he and a young draftsman and a young
chemist set to work with me to build the
new game

  and what was this new game target
shooting with army rifles explosives were
already known on poros being used for
blasting and for airplane bombs with the
aid of the young chemist i adapted these
explosives to be sufficiently slow burning
to drive a rifle without injuring the gun

  in a surprisingly short time we had
turned out a crude rifle which would actu-
ally shoot the heads of the mathematics
and astronomy departments ja babbuh
and buh tedn were then let in on the
secret for the purpose of computing tra-
jectories and designing the sights and wind
leaf which they did by an adaption of the
principles employed in computing the orbits
of celestial bodies

  a hundred and forty-seven rifles were
then turned out and presented to my ath-
letic club

  my club tried out the rifles and when
at last they began to get bulls-eyes they
went wild over the new sport the king
heard and relented sufficiently to send for
me and compliment me

  after being thoroughly tried out in my
hundred rifle shooting was next intro-
duced into the clubs to which my three
assistants belonged and became popular

there as well the idea spread and soon
all the clubs throughout the kingdom were
clamoring for guns the mechanical labora-
tory at kuana was made over into a huge
arsenal and the chemical laboratory
into a huge munition factory while the
athletic clubs of kuana and the vicinity
detailed some of their members to work
overtime in my two plants cupians will
always work overtime in the cause of play

  target practice soon became the national
sport of cupia the craze even reached
such dimensions that queen formis finally
dispatched a special mission to kuana to
study the movement and report whether
it could not be put to some practical use
the report of that mission is now one of
my most treasured possessions and a
framed reproduction of their conclusions
now hangs upon my office wall

  the ant mission concluded and so re-
ported to their queen that the new game
had absolutely no practical application
but that if it kept the crazy cupians quiet
and took their minds off their troubles it
might prove a valuable contribution to-
ward simplifying the enforcement of the
treaty of mooni and so indeed it seemed
toron neglected politics to become a pro-
ficient shot and his anti-formian move-
ment rapidly subsided all of which was
exactly as i had planned

  the collapse of the toron movement
so pleased the exiled prince yuri that he
sent a special ambassador to his brother
offering to assist in introducing the new
sport to the cupians at mooni but i
fear the greeks even when bearing dough-
nuts as we used to say at harvard so
yuris kind offer was declined we did
however present a sample rifle and some
of our powder to the authorities of the
imperial university of the ant-men at their
request for we could not very well refuse

finally king kew himself conde-
scended to sit in at the conferences
between hah babbuh buh tedn ja
babbuh toron and myself he had been
brooding a good deal recently on the in-
dignities inflicted on his people by queen
the radio man



formis with whom he had had several
disputes lately and the committee-work
seemed to divert and cheer him up greatly
but still i was not made a sarkar although
i learned from lilia that hah babbuh had
urged this on the king the influence of
bthuh sarkari was still to strong in fact
it was rumored that she now aspired to
make herself queen of cupia

  well i did not mind better even one
of her sons on the throne than yuri

  having got the new game well under
way i next turned to my old love radio
first i obtained some stones from the
howling valley which was easy because
of my deafness to hertzian waves but
 was unable to put them to any practical
use then i devised a simple wave trap
-for absorbing the ordinary carrying waves
of porovian speech also i arranged a
variable condenser which could so alter
the capacity of the cupian antennae that
selective sending and reception were pos-
sible

  these two devices were combined in a
small box which could easily be carried on
a mans head and be coupled to his an-
tennae my third invention on these lines
was a broadcasting set whereby the nor-
mal cupian sending range of four para-
stads-about fifty yards-was increased
to half a stad-about half a mile

  and now in my frantic quest for a
sarkarship i introduced a still further
new game namely marching evolutions
on an extended scale strictly speaking
this was really an adaptation of an old
game rather than the creation of a new
for marching formations had always been
popular in cupia but my three new radio
devices made it possible to perform these
evolutions by twelves of thousands

  we tried it out in our own twelve thou-
sand the commander broadcast his
orders to the selectively tuned headsets of
the eklats and they in turn to the pootahs
each of whom then directed his hundred
at ordinary wave length the regimental
evolutions went through like clockwork
and this idea spread to the other twelve
thousands of the country

  but still i was not made a sarkar

  i then turned my attention to the con
struction of two huge engines one of which
we mounted on a kerkool and one on a
concrete base in the courtyard of the uni-
versity machine shop the purpose of these
engines was for the present kept secret
but i had a feeling that they would win
me the sarkarship even if everything else
failed

  as a result of my inventions king kew
sufficiently unbent to invite me to occupy
the reviewing stand with him on peace
day when the annual athletic prize giving
was to take place this was a signal honor
which even sarkars might envy but it
was not a sarkarship

  the morning of the five hundredth an-
niversary of the peace of mooni-three
hundred and fifty-eighth in porovian no-
tation-dawned clear and dazzling by 
oclock- oclock in earth time-the
whole plaza and the fields were jammed
with marching clubs

  the minister of play who stood with
me on the reviewing platform at the crest
of university hill-along with the rest of
the cabinet prince toron and a few lead-
ing nobles and professors-sadly remarked
that he was afraid the maneuvers would
have to be given up

  i replied with a smile that i guessed not
though he wras unable to figure out how
evolutions could be possible with that huge
crowd

  pistol shooting had recently been intro-
duced as a tentative subject for next years
games and our committee of five all wore
revolvers strapped to our sides as a spe-
cial badge in recognition of our responsi-
bility for the gala occasion

  the housetops and roads were crowded
with cupian femininity all was ready for
the grand opening i adjusted the controls
of the big sending set and dispatched
poblath who had been detailed as my
aide for the day to inform the king that
the time had arrived for his address

  as kew xii stepped up on the stand
at just  oclock- in earth time-
practically the entire male population of


famous fantastic mysteries

cupia gave him the united states army
present arms in absolute unison it was
an inspiring sight

  i noticed that the king seemed extremely
pale and nervous but i did not give this
much thought at the time

  then i yielded the sending set to him
and he began his speech of welcome a very
different speech from what had been ex-
pected but one which will go down in
history and which every cupian school-
boy throughout the ages will commit to
memory as american boys do the gettys-
burg address

  thus spoke king kew three hundred
and fifty-eight years ago today our fore-
fathers submitted to the indignities of the
treaty of mooni and the stigma of that
infamous treaty attached to the kew
dynasty which was then founded for
twelve generations cupia has been under
the dominion of a race of animals-animals
possessed of human intelligence it is true
but still merely lower animals

  now the parth of our deliverance is
at hand those rifles which you hold were
designed not for play but rather for the
killing of formians the bullets which have
been issued to you this day contain the
highest explosive known to porovian
science with these weapons you are in-
vincible today with your support cupia
will become free and the kew dynasty
will wipe out forever the stigma of its
birth

  are you men or slaves if slaves you
will bow to formis your sons and de-
scendants forever will wearily serve out
their time in her workshops she will have
veto power over all your self-made laws
your present king will give his body as
food for her maggots and your future
kings will cower before her but if you
be men you will today offer up your lives
for your country that cupia may at last
be free

  a murmur as of an angry sea arose
from the crowd and smote upon my an-
tennae the sporting nature of the proposi-
tion appealed to them fully as much as any
sentiments of patriotism

the king turned to me i saluted and
in front of that huge assemblage he
pinntfd upon my breast the long-forgotten
insignia of field marshal of the armies of
a nation simultaneously prince toron and
the three professors displayed the insignia
of general hah babbuh stepped to my side
as my chief of staff while the other three
donned their selective tuners and descended
from the platform to take command of
their several corps the stage was all set
for the final denouement

  the king spoke again let all cupians
who are willing to die for king and coun-
try raise their hands aloft

  up shot every hand on the hill and plain
below

  i seized the phones and shouted then
forward into ant land for cupia king
kew and princess lilia

  for cupia king kew and princess
lilia shouted my army in reply and the
march toward formia began

  but some cupian had betrayed us for
at this instant there appeared at the crest
of the hill overlooking the city a horde
of ant-men who debouched in perfect order
on the fields beyond the plain thank god
that they had not arrived before the kings
speech

  but even as it was things were bad
enough our advance companies recoiled in
terror before the black assault five hun-
dred years of servile peace are not well
calculated to develop a nation of fighters
i saw toron frantically trying to rally his
troops but in vain it had been easy
enough to plan to attack the ant-men but
five hundred years of submission had bred
a tradition of formian omnipotence and
this tradition at once revived when the
formians appeared

  i gazed with horror at the scene here
were thousands upon thousands of pre-
sumably intelligent human beings armed
with the most powerful weapons which
modem science could produce and yet re-
treating in superstitious fear before a hand-
ful of unarmed ants had the high re-
solves of a few paraparths ago degenerated
tp this

- 

  why didnt my men use their rifles let
them firea few shots and they would
realize their power

  so seizing the phones again i tuned
them to torons wave-length and radi-
ated for gods sake stop never mind
your whole army just hold two or three
men get them to use their rifles on the
enemy use your own pistol too

  toron did not know who god was but
he sensed the agony of my appeal and
he gathered the idea seizing the nearest
cupian by the shoulder he swung him
around at the same time discharging his
own revolver an ant-man exploded

  the cupian fascinated fired his own
rifle with equal success then at torons
peremptory command a few more of our
men halted long enough to try their rifles
on the enemy

  at each shot one formian exploded
the effect was splendid our men stopped
formed ranks again opened fire and ad-
vanced once more toward formia the tra-
dition of formian invincibility was de-
stroyed forever

  messengers now came with word that
hundreds of kerkools were bringing up ant
reenforcements over all the roads leading
from the border but what could jaws
avail them against dum-dum bullets

  i learned later that the ants had at-
tacked certain outlying towns of our coun-
try earlier in the day expecting to make
easy work of them and to wreak a
vengeance on the unprotected inhabitants
but our casualties there had been sur-
prisingly light in the village of beem
in the okarze mountains rocks were used
on the attackers and the chance remark
fine target practice had suggested to
some bright local mind the use of rifles
with which the ant-men had been repulsed
with ease at bartlap one of the enemy
had indiscreetly mentioned that rifles were
the cause of the war and immediately
rifles were effectively produced in most
of the other instances the formians had
been recalled to reenforce the attack on
kuana

  now a new development occurred for a

fleet of airships appeared on the horizon
and presently high explosive bombs began
dropping with frightful havoc among my
astounded troops who once more broke
and ran in a few paraparths the planes
would be over the city

  i dispatched poblath on the run to the
university and soon my human sense of
hearing was rewarded by a sharp crack-
crack-crack from the mechanics building

  the first plane toppled and fell the sec-
ond and then the third the others
sensing a power beyond their ability to
combat wheeled and withdrew our armies
reformed and once more advanced toward
formia the first of my huge secret ma-
chines an anti-aircraft gun had spoken

  soon messengers brought word that in-
tense fighting was in progress for the pos-
session of the third gate of course it
would be many days before our forces
could reach the western two gates but the
bulk of the populations of both countries
lived near the third gate due to the
mountainous nature of the country to the
west

  then came news that the formians at
the third gate had been flanked by some
of our men who had surmounted the pale
with scaling ladders the third gate fell
into the hands of cupia our victorious
armies were on enemy soil

  it was war to the hilt and it satisfied
the sporting sense of all cupia that the
formians had invaded and attacked first

  a special detachment of mooni-trained
aviators and mechanics had gone at once
to the three planes as soon as we had shot
them down and now one of them arose
into the air fully repaired

  the moment had arrived for the final
master stroke in the new cupian national
game-war for the second huge machine
in the courtyard of the department of
mechanics was a sixteen inch barbette
coast artillery rifle which had been trained
upon the imperial city of the ant queen
by exact elevation and azimuth carefully
computed by buh tedn

  the huge gun boomed forth again and
again it boomed as our spotting plane re-


famous fantastic mysteries

ported for adjustment of fire finally just
at nightfall the signal came to cease fir-
ing the imperial city from which queen
formis had been directing her troops had
been totally destroyed and with it pre-
sumably the queen and her friend and
ally the renegade yuri

  our armies still pressed forward into
formia from air attack by the three re-
paired planes and by the anti-aircraft gun
which had been sent forward by kerkool
i was jubilant but not so apparently
king kew

  what is the matter sir i asked
why do you look so sad on this glorious
day of deliverance are you thinking of
our poor boys who have fallen

  no he replied i did not dare tell
you before for fear that your well known
impetuousity would disrupt our plans but
now you can know the princess lilia
has been missing since morning the fact
that all of her clothes are intact except
her sleeping robe leads me to think that
she must have been kidnaped during the
night

  my god i ejaculated in english
then turning the command over to hah
babbuh and instructing him to move his
headquarters to the third gate in the
morning i hastened to the apartments of
my sweetheart

  bthuh met me there in tears and said
my princess is dead my princess is
dead last night through connivance with
me prince yuri drugged her with saffra
root and spirited her away to the imperial
city of formia i knew all your plans
except the purposes of your two huge can-
nons or i should have warned yuri of
those too i thought merely to spoil your
victory and so gain my revenge the old
king too had spurned my amorous ad-
vances and so i declared war on cupia
but cupia has won in spite of me and
as a punishment for my guilt my beloved
mistress has been killed

  there could be no doubt of it every
living thing in the city of the queen had
been destroyed my victory was turned
to ashes in despair i sank upon a couch

  but comforting arms stole around my
shoulders and a soft voice spoke in my
anteonae cabot can you ever forgive
me i love you so that i would willingly
give back to you your princess just to
make you happy but alas she is lost
to us forever cannot we solace ourselves
with love for each other cabot cabot
i love you so my dear

  and her fragrant voluptuous intoxicat-
ing presence wrapped itself around my
tired body and despondent soul

chapter xvi

cabot tells the world

there on the same couch on which
i had often caressed the princess
i held in my arms her betrayer the lovely
bthuh so soon does love forget

  so soon love does not forget casting
aside the seductive betrayer of my prin-
cess i sprang to my feet resolving never
to give up hope until i actually saw lilias
dead body and even then to remain true
to her in death bthuhs last chance had
come and gone she had played her last
card and lost

  although it was now night i at once
called my aide and summoned a squad out
of my own hundred which had been re-
tained as the kings bodyguard then
requisitioning a fleet of kerkools we set
out for the imperial city leaving poblath
with his former love bthuh

  tame her if you can and good luck
to you was my parting admonition

  the trip was made in record time by
the light of our flash lamps we found that
the ruins were guarded by several hundred
ant-men so we sent for reenforcements to
be furnished in the morning and then we
bivouacked for the night taking turns
keeping awake and sniping at the enemy
whenever they showed a light or came
within the beams of ours

  early in the morning a company of
cupians reported to me and we at once
began the assault of the ruins carrying
our objective with but little difficulty

then came the individual fighting in
the radio man

- 

the corridors and in this the ant-men were
not at so great a disadvantage they am-
bushed our soldiers they pushed rocks on
them from above and all in all they made
away with nearly half our force before
the remaining handful of defenders broke
and fled from the city

  our survivors were put to work ex-
ploring the mangled body of queen
formis was hailed with joy but no signs
were discovered of either yuri or lilia
although occasionally we would come
upon an enemy straggler and kill him

  finally on rounding a turn whom
should i meet face to face but the ant-
man who had let me go after i had
rescued him from the woofus i recognized
him at once

  yahoo number -- i hailed
him a life for a life

  nay he replied for you owe me
nothing on that score rut if you will spare
me i will repay you well

  your life is already yours i said
then said he i will lead you to
the princess

  i could have embraced the uncouth
creature for joy but suspecting a trap i
gathered nearly a squad of my soldiers
before following the ant-man he led us
into the subterranean depths of the city
several times we had to remove fallen
fragments which barred our way and once
had to wait until explosives could be ob-
tained to blast a passage but at last we
came within sight of an undamaged
dungeon where lilia lay chained alive
nd well v

  yet even as we hailed her through a
crack in the debris we saw two ant-men
enter the dungeon through another pas-
sage unchain the princess and carry her
away

  quick as a flash i remembered my re-
volver and opened fire through the crack
blasting one of her abductors but as i
drew a bead on the other my weapon was
knocked from my hand

  turning angrily i beheld our guide
standing over me

  i fulfilled my bargain he said when

i showed you the princess now i owe you
no more those formians are my fellow
countrymen and i have saved one of them
at least from the horrible death

  and lost me my princess i shouted
angrily

  we were now surrounded by my squad
with drawn rifles but they did not dare
fire for fear of hitting ne i was at the
mercy of our guide he had too much re-
spect for the dum-dum bullets however
and was easily hauled off of me and placed
under arrest

  my men then proceeded to hack their
way into the dungeon and we at once
followed the trail of the princess this
was not easy for the city was a total
wreck a hundred ways presented them-
selves through which her captor might
have crawled so we withdrew and threw
a cordon around the entire city dispatch-
ing a few searching parties again into the
interior this was made possible by ad-
ditional reenforcements from headquarters

  as luck would have it the ant-man
finally made his appearance with lilia
held tightly in his jaws at the very point
in the line of sentries where i happened
to be instantly a dozen rifles covered him

  but he radiated the peremptory com-
mand stop put down your rifles
put them down i ordered

  now he continued if a rifle is raised
again i bite and the princess dies she
lives only on condition that i am given
safe passage with her as my prisoner once
within our lines she will be treated well
for she will prove a valuable hostage to
support the demands of formis for a re-
turn to power

  formis is dead i objected

  one formis is dead he replied but
there are always maggots which we can
fatten to make a new queen

  at this point lilia interjected faintly
bite oh formian for i would die rather
than betray my country

  but i said you may proceed not a
rifle will be raised against you for the
princess must be saved

  nothing however had been said about


famous fantastic mysteries

revolvers and evidently the ant-man was
unacquainted with that weapon as he
passed through our lines keeping a care-
ful watch on the rifles of our sentries i
fired my revolver from the hip and a
moment later lilia was clasped safely in
my arms

  tenderly we greeted each other she was
parched and hungry and our first task
was to give her food and drink which
were easily found among the ruins

  then came explanations she had awak-
ened to find herself in the dungeon about
noon of the day before yuri had informed
her that the cupian attack had been met
and stopped and that airplanes were about
to destroy kuana then he had been hur-
riedly called away and she had seen no
one since she could hardly believe us
when we told her that the attack had been
a success that queen formis was dead
and that the power of formia was broken
forever

when she had rested i at once sent
her home under guard in a kerkool
and myself proceeded to headquarters to
learn how the war was progressing much
as i longed to accompany her my first
duty was to my adopted country

  to number -- before leaving
i gratefully offered an honorable freedom
in cupia but he scornfully replied that he
would rather die fighting for his own
country i respected his attitude and so
gave him a safe-conduct through our lines
to rejoin his own troops later in the war
his number was reported to me as being
among the casualties

  at headquarters i found hah babbuh
in fine spirits the power of formia was
broken indeed

  wautoosa had fallen into our hands
and with it a number of planes which
thus were added to our steadily growing
air-force kerkools were patrolling all the
roads shooting ant-men at sight

  hah was particularly jubilant over what
had happened at mooni early on peace
day the cupian students had somehow
received word of what was afoot joining

with the slaves they had slightly out-
numbered the ant-men there present and
had captured the university after a fierce
struggle thus preventing the ant-men from
removing or destroying the priceless gems
of knowledge stored there when our van-
guard arrived our students were already
in control

  in the days that followed our advance
progressed city after city fell into our
hands in sufficient numbers and contain-
ing sufficient supplies so that we did not
have to give any thought to the quartering
or feeding of our men all that was neces-
sary was a steady stream of ammunition
proceeding from kuana to our outposts

  i had given strict orders that doggo
and yuri were to be taken alive the
former because i wished to spare him as
a friend the latter because i looked for-
ward with extreme pleasure to seeing him
executed for treason but neither was cap-
tured the numbers of all dead ant-men
were taken and turned in but doggos
number was not among them and to this
day i do not know what became of him
or of yuri

  it was my ambition to exterminate the
entire race of ant-men from the face of
poros with the single exception of my
friend doggo but this wish was not to
be gratified for as the formians re-
treated southward our line of communica-
tion became more and more extended and
our troops more and more undisciplined

  gradually the formians obtained rifles
particularly from the two cities which
they had bombed then they made a stand
and sent out snipers and this netted them
more rifles

  our people began to grumble the
widows and orphans of the slain did not
appreciate the honor which had been
thrust upon them the sport-loving
cupians in the field chafed under mili-
tary restraint and demanded to be re-
turned home to their games and a con-
siderable number of the populace were
even heard to say that two years slavery
to formia was far better than a life-long
slavery in the army of a military dictator
the radio man

- 

-meaning the four or five weeks since the
war had started

  so reluctantly king kew concluded
a new peace with what was left of formia
a new pale was set up far to the south
of the old formia had to bear the entire
cost of the war ant-men were forbidden
to carry arms or to enter cupia and all
their airships were confiscated the kings
of cupia reserved a veto power over
formian laws forever but king kew
wisely decided not to demoralize cupia
by the introduction of formian slaves

  our university set up a  branch at
mooni in order that the glamour of that
name might not be lost our bravest
soldiers and our war widows were re-
warded-by grants of land and of city resi-
dences in the captured territory which
almost completely alleviated the popular
discontent

  not until the treaty was concluded did
i return from the field the papers were
signed in the same hall at mooni which
had witnessed the degradation of cupia
five hundred years ago for defeat is
bitterest at the scene of a former victory
as poblath remarked and on the occasion
of the present treaty kew surrounded by
his generals and in the presence of the
signatories was crowned king of all poros
this idea by the way was due to pob-
lath the philosopher and it won him a
barsarkarship which came in very handy

  there was much decorating with medals
and handing out of promotions needless
to state the king made me a sarkar and
the assembly not to be outdone voted
to make me a winko or field marshal for
life

now marriage was possible between
lilia and me and also between
bthuh and poblath for bthuh had proven
to be a good sport and had finally ac-
cepted him and as lilia had prophesied
bthuh settled down and became a most
quiet and domestic wife

  the proudest and happiest moment of
my entire life was when upon the jdining-
stand of kuana in the presence of the

assembled multitude king kew pro-
nounced the words which made lilia my
wife

  we spent our honeymoon camping out
on a most beautiful rocky island in the
middle of lake luno which lies nestled in
the hills and surrounded by deep woods
about a thousand stads to the northward of
kuana i had discovered the place by ac-
cident while on an airplane trip to an iso-
lated mountain community immediately
after the war for the purpose of con-
ferring decorations on the first company
which had stood its ground against the
onslaught of the ant-men

  the walls of the island rise sheer some
nine parastads from the waters edge save
where in one spot the sloping sward runs
through a cleft in the rocks down to a
sandy beach the interior of the island
slopes gently from the cliffs down from
all sides to a little pond in the center
and is about equally divided between lawn
and stately grove here lilia and i plan
to build

  here we spent many golden days swim-
ming and fishing and climbing but mostly
just looking into each others eyes

  at our first dip in the water i was
horribly embarrassed in the first place
i had to shed my headset which always
puts me at a disadvantage and in the
second place my wings came unstuck and
fell off and my matted hair exposed my
ears so that i stood before her an earth-
man with all my horrible earthly de-
formities yet still she loved me

  our honeymoon was idyllic and ideal
but all good things must end and we
finally had to return to the city to take
up my duties for added to my honors
was a place in the royal cabinet as
minister of play the former incumbent
having died during my absence

  i have various projects in hand for my
adopted country already a network of
radio stations is going up throughout the
land a systematic extermination of the
whistling bee is under way by means of
anti-aircraft artillery various earth de-
vices are being tested out in our labora-


famous fantastic mysteries

tories as fast as i can recall them to mem-
ory and i have resumed but with great
precautions my experiments on the wire-
less transmission of matter in which work
toron is assisting

  lilia and i occupy her old suite in the
palace and entertain constantly among
our most frequent guests are my old friend
poblath and his completely tamed wife

  but often i wonder what has become of
doggo and yuri in spite of present
prosperity cupia is not safe if the rene-
gade prince still lives on the planet but
i hope that doggo survives and that we
shall meet again

  fate now seems to be through with its
hard knocks but happy as i am i occa-
sionally wonder what is going on in dear
old boston whether americas world war
allies ever repaid the billions which they
borrowed whether our country joined the
league of nations in time to save the
world from another european menace etc
etc and i have a yearning to write home

  of course the obvious step for me was
to attempt communication by radio so
i built a particularly powerful sending set
with long wave length but the lack of
any reply convinced me that my signals
were not being received on earth

  so recently i got together my old com-

mittee of five hah babbuh buh tedn
ja babbuh toron and myself and to-
gether we designed a super gun and a
streamline projectile and computed the
necessary powder-charge and principles
of aiming so that we could shoot the
projectile to the earth

  then i prepared this manuscript in
quadruplicate with three of which copies
i shall try to reach the world for this
purpose each copy will be placed in a
gold cylinder and be swathed in the fur
of the fire-worm that peculiar creature
which dares to live almost at the edge
of the boiling seas because its matted fur
is the most perfect insulator against heat
known on poros

  the swathed cylinder will then be
packed into the interior of the projectile
and a covering put on especially calculated
to resist the devouring heat of passage
through the atmospheres of the two
planets the projectile will be weighed its
center of gravity will be determined and
its moments of inertia will be tested the
firing data being corrected accordingly
it will be placed in the gun then at ex-
actly the appointed time the gun will be
discharged and may god speed my mes-
sage on its way to you my earth-brethren

the kiss of death

by laura withrow

there are all kinds of kisses-of love of friendship of peace of brotherhood
and there is the judas kiss this author tells a startling story of still another kind

i am happy this morning not even
when i was a care-free child did the
blood pulse so gaily through my veins

  my heart is beating time to music in
my soul that is as joyous as are the songs
of birds music that sings one triumphant
refrain

  it is over you are free you are
free

  while every nerve and fibre of my being
is thrilling with that exultant welcome
song nature herself gives a token she
understands and is rejoicing with me

  that crimson and gold radiance widen-
ing and deepening-the dividing line be-
tween night and day tells me in the great
mothers mystic silent language that hap-
piness is to come that rainbow splendor
brightening the dull gray earth is an
omen of joy of love and peace

  i believe in omens

  had i heeded natures warnings i
would never have been his wife but let
that pass those strange sad bitter days
are over and must be forgotten i turn
now to the future that waits rich with
promise

  before permitting mind and heart to
run riot along the golden pathway i will
tread i must see him under the grassy
earth on the hillsides and over him a
marble shaft its presence a reminder that
the past is dead its white finger pointing
heavenward as a suggestion of the life and
joy to come

  as i close the door on all that should
not have been that might have been so
different i will wear black of the most
somber dye so that the world may see
how i am sorrowing for my husband

  i will hide my great secret justas i
hid my fierce heartaches from its imper-
tinent gaze one bares the heart only to
those who understand-through love

  they his own people in the hour after
it was over found me wearing a filmy
white gown redolent with the perfume of
dead years  wore it last in my girlhood
days the fancy occurred to me that by
putting it on i might blot out the unhappy
married life between the then and now
and be a girl again

  my black robes lay in a neglected heap
on the floor and in my shimmering drape-
ries i was pacing restlessly up and down
the room eyes and mind and heart wan-
dering in the land of happy dreams

  sadly they watched me and tried to
speak words of consolation at last i per-
suaded them to go away and then i turned
the key when alone i waved my white
arms with glee and laughed-softly lest
they hear it was such a relief to be free
after those years of bondage i laughed
and cried in one breath for joy

  then wearing that fleecy robe and
pinning a bunch of red roses at my breast
symbol of the new life pulsing within me
i studied myself in the mirror to see
whether the inner woman the soul of me
had thrown off the shackles

  the transformation was weird and won-
derful it was as if you had taken a
delicate brush and painted out the lines of
grief and care left by the sun on the
daguerreotype of a woman who had known
years of pain and sorrow

  in that hour of freedom my features
softened the burden fell from me the
roses of youth bloomed in my cheeks the
light of youth shone now in my eyes i
smiled back at the radiant vision and
promised it lifes best gifts-peace con-
tentment love

  when decorously clad in deepest black
i passed the portal of my doorway i dared
not let them look into my eyes fearing
the triumphant light i knew was there

would betray me and tell the hearts
truth-that i was happy never before
had i known such happiness because he
was lying down there in the dark drawing-
room dead to earths voices evermore

  i am freefree

  i could chant the words until they would
ring far above the harsh roll of the sea
and the shrill voices of the winds   

  yet in the first hours after he passed
on there were fear-haunted moments i
found myself listening for footsteps-his
footsteps and an icy hand clutched my
heart it seemed as if he were living and
in another instant would be by my side
the old mocking sneering smile in his eyes
and on his lips that was only yesterday
though if i count time by heart-throbs it
was years ago

  to drive away his spirit if it were
lingering in the old familiar places i asked
them to leave me i would spend the last
night alone with my husband

  with eyes speaking sympathy and im-
ploring me to be brave and calm they
slipped away and left me among the
shadows

ow i was alone with the dead my
dead

  it was such a new and delicious experi-
ence to be beyond his power long i
studied the white face death had been
kind the spirit had taken with it the
evil that fast was molding the helpless
clay i was shown the man my husband
was meant to be the man he might have
been

  the sneer was gone from the curved lips
which told loves tale the hard lines had
faded from the face with the frown gone
that had become habitual in life noble-
ness sat on the broad high brow it was
a weird metamorphosis he was younger
and was again the lover now that he be-
longed to death

  but this change did not make me sorry
it only steeled my heart still more against
him it showed at this late day all he
might have been to me

  with folded arms i walked around the
still figure watching it and thinking nf
the gtrlhood hopes and dreams of happi-
ness which one by one he trampled under
ruthless cruel feet with mocking laughter
for my youth and inexperience for my
fantasies my castles in the air the wasted
years and my darkened life all his work
confronted me

 suddenly i felt that he was near my
heart stood still but not with fear repul
sion rather it was as if he could put out
his hand and touch me and i felt the old
horror at the mere thought of physical
contact

  then it occurred to me that even with
the added power death gives the spirit he
might not know i had conquered he
might not understand that i had sent his
soul away and thus freed myself from
that unholy bondage

  i wanted him to know to tell him would
be my revenge for all that i had suffered
his death was retribution but this would
be revenge now was my chance with
the empty shell between us i would tell
him i knew that he was hovering over
the white face watching me so i stood at
the feet and faced him and in my eyes
was the triumphant joy that was singing
in my heart

  you are dead dead dead i chanted
to that spirit creature

  do you know what that means you
are there and i am here the barrier be-
tween us you may never pass you are
not my husband i will bury that which
lies between us now with the pomp
and circumstance due the man i married
then i will forget you or if i remember
it will be with exultant joy because you
have passed to your own place and i am
in my own oh i am so happy

  suddenly there were queer rustling
noises around me as of swinging drape-
ries and an icy blast struck me full in the
face i became cold from head to feet just
as when he was alive and near then i
was certain he heard and understood and
i laughed mockingly
the kiss of death



  but that is not all i want to tell you
i continued in low measured bell-like
tones that vibrated strangely in the still
room tones that had in them the echo
of music but the finality of death itself

  i did it  killed your earth life
and sent you wandering on your dark
way do you hear i your wife the wom-
man you thought you owned body and
soul and spirit

  do you not recollect i told you more
than once when you were cruel that i
would kill you some time and you
answered me sneeringly reminding me of
my forgiving spirit

  you knew me too well to fear such a
threat i wanted to do right i would be
sorry for my wicked words when my anger
had passed away

  then you whose every act was a
mockery of all things holy would quote
scripture applicable to me as an unruly
wife you were so sure of me do you re-
member

  you were right i was not dangerous
in my stormy moods my anger was too
fleeting but those gusts of passion were
the beginning of the end

  each day my heart became harder and
colder until it was ice and iron until the
only living thing within me was my hatred
of you my husband

  always you would have me near you
and i felt as if life itself was ebbing from
me in a steady stream of hate and loath-
ing and resentment wide enough to sweep
you from my sight

  yet i was treating you pleasantly
kindly trying to make both you and the
world believe i loved you for i would
not admit i had failed to find happiness

  next came the quiet hours when i
thought the situation over calmly and
decided you must die i had borne you as
my cross for weary years trying to make
a nobler man of you and failed you
were so certain you were perfect that you
were hopeless i could do no more

  it was either your death or mine that
was clear to me my death would not
help you you would be no better no
nobler with the years no readier to die
if i passed on and let you live

  so i decided you must go even though
it was into the darkness and give me free-
dom happiness

  my decision formed i delved deeper
into those old books on magic the books
you so abhorred until i mastered their
secret

  it confirmed my belief

  i could send you from earth if i con-
centrated the hatred you had bred in my
soul and turned the deadly current on
you

  coolly calmly with inscrutable eyes
i began my task

  while smiling in your face listening
without a murmur to your jeering mock-
ing words i concentrated all the strength
of my soul and sent forth against you
magnetic waves that vibrated with hate
and bitterness always they whispered
death and your robust health began to

w

i talked with god

     yes i did-actually and literally



and as a result of that little talk with god some ten
years ago a strange new power came into my life
after  years of horrible sickening dismal failure
this strange power brought to me a sense of over-
whelming victory and i have been overcoming every
undesirable condition of my life ever since what a
change it was now-i have credit at more than one
bank i own a beautiful home drive a lovely car own
a newspaper and a large office building and my wife
and family are amply provided for after i leave
for shores unknown in addition to these tnaterial
benefits i have a sweet peace in my life i am
happy as happy can be no circumstance ever upsets
me for i have learned how to draw upon the in-

visible god-law under any and all circumstances

  you too may find and use the same staggering
power of the god-law that i use it can bring to
you too whatever things are right and proper for
you to have do you believe this  it wont cost much

famous fantastic mysteries

fail when you consulted a physician
about your strange symptoms you who
never had been ill joy winged my feet
the hatred you had bred in my soul was
stronger than you i would be free

rphe doctor did not understand your

  a case and could do nothing for you
in all his experience he had never known
a parallel

  physically perfect without a care
contented in your home and prosperous
in your profession yet you were racked
with pain grew weaker thinner paler

  how you clung to me begging me to
save your life and asking my forgiveness
daily for all your past unkindness

  you did not intend to hurt me oh
no you were only jesting you had been
harsh sometimes because you loved me
on account of your love you expected
more of me than of other women for you
loved me tenderly you blamed me be-
cause you wanted me to be perfect

  i listened as the sphinx might while
i bathed your aching head it was too
late for the best of excuses your words
only hastened the end for they were false
as the mirage in the desert inspired by
the fear of death and the desire to get
full service from me-love and care

  it was so characteristic of you never
once did you think of me self was al-
ways first you were consistent to the
end

  outwardly i was the devoted wife as
always in our married years i gave you
the creature comforts-kindness too even
that which looked like love i could af-
ford to be magnanimous

  every day you thought the change for
the better was at hand-tomorrow you
would begin to mend but each rising sun
found you weaker as i knew it would
ever that subtle fluid was weakening your
life forces for my singular power became
stronger daily

  you would ask me to take you in my
arms and kiss you do you remember

  this was the hardest ordeal of my day
-to touch you as would one who loved

you it gave the lie to all that was holiest
and best within me and yet it helped me
to success

  i knew that when the end came it
would be when i had to kiss you all the
hatred and loathing and repulsion in me
passed then from my soul to yours

  sometimes you would faint when your
lips touched mine and the watchers would
whisper it was because of your great love
for me they could not read our souls

  the doctor admitted defeat and ad-
vised me to be brave the end was coming
swiftly i knew it

  you wanted a kiss you would sleep
but first i must say good night

  i knew you would sleep-soundly too
and i asked if you were ready should
death come

  your dull eyes from which lifes bright-
ness had faded flashed with the old wick-
ed jealous suspicious light you rallied
and flung back bitterly

   you need not flatter yourself that
i will die you will never have an oppor-
tunity to marry another i shall live to
bury you those were your last words

  i smiled and then-i took you in my
arms holding you close to my heart i
kissed you tenderly once-twice-

  the fountain of my own life stood
still in that moment of supreme effort for
an instant i thought my soul was going
tooh

  then with startled eyes as if in that
comprehensive last glance which swept
this world and another you saw the un-
known in awful guise spirit and body
parted company i was free

  oh yes i shed tears hysterical tears
but they were tears of joy not sorrow
no one understood and so they pitied
me-the widow yet i was delirious with
happiness

  had i gone from you and let you
live i would have feared you though
half the world lay between us always i
would have expected to turn and find you
by my side now i can defy and mock
you for i do not fear the dead

  oh i am happy
the kiss of deatk



  i have my freedom and love is wait-
ing somewhere down the way the love
that glorifies a womans life even now
from afar i feel the presence of the one
who will be all to me that you were not

  earth could not hold both him and
you

as i spoke those words to that spirit
creature two malignant eyes stared
at me out of space they were his eyes
seemingly suspended in the air over that
still figure stretched between us but such
eyes

  they were larger than in life and stared
at me with the expression of one who had
fated unnamable horrors there was that
in them i could not fathom i had seen
them reveal evil passions in life but now
the wickedness of a myriad of worlds blazed
in their depths it was as if they had lived
all of evil known in all the shining spheres
and were eager though powerless to put
it into words there was in those eyes
too the hopelessness of the lost souls in
the halls of darkness

  slowly slowly they came toward me
staring into my eyes burning into my soul
their awful message

  they were death personified death
come for me

  instinctively i knew that if shaken with
one quiver of fear i too would cross the
line to my home-land

  in this crucial moment i faced him
serene smiling unafraid

  he could not claim my soul our paths
had parted never again to touch in any
world suddenly he too knew

  as he realized the truth and his help-
lessness he who had tried to take me with
him a wild hopeless bitter cry wailed
up and down the room coming from every-
where at once and died away like the
moans of a sobbing child

  again an icy blast struck me then
followed stillness a strange sense of iso-
lation voice and wind and eyes were gone

  he knew all he knew that he was con-
quered he had fled

  i was alone i was free   

  free   

    no luck my friend youre off her book

the plunge of theknupfen

 by leonard grover

 out of the scientific records of the past we give you the astonishing account of

 a voyage into earths very center

i have many times thought of writing
an account of the many strange and
wonderful incidents that happened to
me during this very last year but have
hesitated from fear that they will be
denied credibility

  but at last i have gathered courage
and have set down the amazing details

  i am robert wiley gough

  three years ago i left my native town
grafton in the old bay state and went
west to better my fortune

  i am a telegrapher and secured en-
gagement with the comstock mines where
i remained for many days far down in the
earth transmitting to the miners telegraphic
instructions which came from the super-
intendents office above on the surface

  i had left and was in san francisco to
try for a more healthful employment

  i had taken a long walk from the cliff
house along the sands of the ocean

how did you come
here i asked

i might well ask the
same was the reply

copyright  by the prank a munsey company


  the pathway for miles was solitary not
one human being was visible till some
miles inland a lad told me that i might
shorten my journey back to san francisco
by crossing a great sand-dune at the left

  at the summit of this dune i saw a
charming picture-a narrow valley sur-
rounded by gray barren dunes with a
band of the brightest green running
through a row of windmills was irrigating
the plunge of the knupfen

- 

the valley from artesian depths a group
of five great wind-wheels almost overlap-
ping each other provoked my curiosity
the wheels were upheld by a framework
of tall iron stanchions and below them
was a cabin built against the side of the
dune

  i drew near to investigate

  as i stepped within the patch of green
nearest the cabin at the door appeared
a man who came directly toward me he
was perhaps fifty years old possessed a
pleasant but resolute face and a stature
slightly above the average his dress was
poor and in keeping with his apparent
occupation

  he paused squarely in front of me his
appearance plainly inquiring what do
you want here

  good-day i ventured i was curi-
ous to know why you required so many
wind wheels for such a small amount of
water and garden

  i might pipe the water to a point
below

  that was true he might be supplying
fresh water to a point nearer the ocean
i had no time to press my investigation
further for i was put in the attitude of
the answerer rather than the questioner

i had no reason to conceal anything
nd he quickly drew from me my occu-
pation its association with the comstock
my present lack of employment-in fact
everything

  at the conclusion of his series of in-
quiries he invited me inside his cabin

  the wall against the hill was completely
covered by a curtain of soiled muslin i
was speculating as to what it might con-
ceal when he burst in upon my thoughts
by recounting the facts he had learned
from me

  you are a telegrapher you have been
far down in the ground for more than
a week at a time you have nothing at
present in view how would you like to
secure fifty thousand dollars in gold a
month for yourself

  i made haste to answer	--

  fifty thousand dollars a month is a

great deal of money but i would dearly
like to hold down the job for a year

  he said that he was about to advertise
for a man when lo providence brought
the man to his door i was just the one
for his purpose would i listen to him
and swear not to betray him if i declined
his offer

  i promised that i would keep his

secret

his name was christian aldgeldt he
had been professor of chemistry at
one of the eastern colleges he had ex-
perimented and invented he led me by
gradation to a comprehension of his pro-
ject

  he denied the atomic theory he was
convinced that no one order of matter
could be wholly eliminated from all other
orders of matter-in a word that there was
gold in everything

  he had been up in the snake river
country above lewiston where there were
minute quantities of placer-gold in every
foot of land along the river he had become
convinced by experiment that this gold
was disseminated by atmospheric elec-
tricity

  there was a man there known as the
brass monkey he had seen him his
face bore the look of a broken bar of
brass under the microscope he discov-
ered particles of gold-dust in his pores

  investigation disclosed that the man
had been to the hot springs in arkansas
for medical treatment and taken the
baths had become saturated with copper
and it was on this copper that the elec-
trical atmosphere was making deposits of
gold

  now said he gold exists deep in
the earth in volatile form as volatile as
quicksilver the remote volcanic upheaval
which threw these great ranges of moun-
tains into being placed the great mass of
the precious metal to the west of the
rockies the greatest deposits of placer
gold were found along the valley of the
sacramento

  the recent discovery of rich placer-


famous fantastic mysteries

diggings on the shores of nome prompted
me to examine the sands of the coast of
california near the watery output of this
valley i have found great evidences of it
they tell a story of what lies not too far
away

  these artesian wells run from four
hundred to eight hundred feet one of
mine to the depth of one thousand feet
from a bucket of water taken from any
one of the wells i am able to secure mi-
nute deposits of gold my deepest well
shows an increase over the others

  everything points to the fact that be-
neath this spot perhaps at a depth not
greater than four thousand feet lies a
vast subterranean lake or menstruum of
fluid gold

  he paused to see how i had been im-
pressed by his account at each stage he
had shown me evidences of the various de-
posits i was awed at his recital

  but said i you cannot bore an
artesian well to the depth of four thou-
sand feet

  let me show you

  he drew to one side the muslin curtain

  i saw a great dynamo and behind it a
huge rock of iron pyrites he had covered
this rock with a coating of shellac and
had made of it probably the largest stor-
age battery in the world for nearly two
years the steady breeze from the ocean had
driven the wind-wheels above which had
kept the dynamo in constant action until
there was stored as he alleged enough
power to drive all the machinery of san
francisco for ten days

  next this at the right was a wedge-
shaped box of curious construction about
four feet square by seven in height the
sides were corrugated with ridges of steel
scales which worked very much like the
wrinkles of an angelworm

  there was a huge door with a porthole
glazed with a lens like those of the
steamers the wedge-shaped bottom was
covered with many thousands of curious
little jointed teeth which of all things
in the world looked most like the claws
of a mole

  interspersed with these were numerous
diamond-pointed drills

  this the professor told me was hi
knupfen the name can mean but-
tons or sometimes ready money i un-
derstand

  he had procured from a great eastern
mill countless miles of fine wire made
expressly for this purpose glass tubes had
been inserted in blocks of iron and drawn
to the fineness of a hair each thread of
which held a minute flexible glass tube
great reels of this stood at the right

  of the velocity with which the knupfen
could bore into the earth the professor
was ignorant he calculated the action
of the teeth at eight thousand six hundred
and forty vibrations to the second not-
withstanding all resistance he believed that
four thousand feet could be reached in
twenty-four hours

  the machine carried in its descent a
wire for communication and four of the
hollow wires when fluid gold was reached
these were to be operated from above
by electrical attraction and minute streams
of gold were to pour into our coffers

  the magnitude of the possibilities awed
me he offered me the half which i thought
unjust to him and it was stipulated that
i was to receive one-fourth

  i reserved the right to draw out when
i had received a halfmillion

  the machine was stored with canned
provision chemicals and implements

  it was ten oclock in the evening on
the th of january  after receiving
the last instructions from professor ald-
geldt that i stepped into the knupfen for
my trip of discovery one last shake of
the hand a mutual wish for success and i
closed the heavy door and made it fast
within

  in an instant i became conscious of a
buzzing sound as of a swarm of bees i
caught a glimpse of the professor through
the observation port-hole as his hand
went out to touch the connecting lever and
in one flash too quick for the eye to pic-
ture i dropped from him as though from
a balloon
the plunge of the knupfen

- 

  all was darkness without an electric
burner lighted all within i had no sense
of motion whatever the buzzing sounds
alternately continued and disappeared

within ten minutes my ear-drums
gave me the sensation which one
feels after rapidly descending on the
railroad from a great altitude to the depths
of the plains below

  this continued it seemed to me for
an age but my clock told me that not
half an hour had passed when i felt a
sense of exhilaration as from a dose of
oxygen

  a sound like the pounding of a police-
mans night-stick on the pavement dis-
turbed me it was the clicking of the
telegraph

  the professor ticked off how are you
feeling

  i described my condition and inquired
how far have i gone

  you are long past the four thousand
footmark i am now waiting the time when
you no longer hear the buzzing sound you
will then have reached the subterranean
lake

  but how far am i

  when i signaled you the reel marked
fifty-seven miles now you are-a mo-
ments pause while he looked at the
indicator-eighty-six miles

  good heavens and the clock indicated
but fifty-one and two-fifth minutes after
ten more than a mile and a half a min-
ute impossible the vast magnetic force
had deranged the clock certainly the time
seefned much longer to me

  what time is it with you

  eight minutes to eleven

  the clocks were then together i was
lost in astonishment could it be possible 
that i had dropped into the earth with
such inconceivable velocity-faster than
the flight of the swiftest bird

  after a time the buzzing sound com-
pletely ceased i informed the professor
and he telegraphed me that he had stopped
the knupfen and that i was nowgus-
pended for observation

  i turned to the search-light and saw
through the lens that i was surrounded
by a fluid body of murky yellow with the
naked eye i could discern particles of gold
floating around as one sees them in an
electroplating bath

  eureka i wired it is here

  thank heaven fervently responded
the professor

  are you ready to pump i asked

  a short pause and the answer all
ready came over the wire

  now was a brief interval of acute men-
tal suspense had all his long and ingenious
labor and my terrible risk gone for naught
the next fifteen minutes would tell the
story

   i adjusted the suction wires and waited
for the verdict in exactly twelve minutes
the professor telegraphed

  we are completely successful the gold
flows and is depositing freely it will be
impossible to determine the extent until
after assay tomorrow

  mutual congratulations were inter-
changed we had passed through a long
and anxious day it was now after mid-
night and we agreed to seek rest in sleep

  it was nine before the clicking of the
instrument awoke me after a brief inter-
change of morning compliments i began
my breakfast and he went to his two
hundred miles above me this was to be
my first of many meals in the bowels of
the earth and i was glad to find that i
enjoyed it the coffee toast and egg were
as appetizing as to a convalescing invalid

  and now the suction wires were placed
and the occult forces of electricity once
more resumed their work

  it seems odd to me today how as a
mere matter of course we took our strange
situations-interchanging small talk over
the wire and the professor relating to
me the current news of the morning san
francisco paper while the dynamo was
filling our store of gold

  five oclock in the afternoon arrived
and the professor informed me that he
had closed the baths for assay four hours
followed when the professor telegraphed


famous fantastic mysteries

  the result is not entirely satisfactory
i must wait till tomorrow morning for
further analysis

  all efforts to obtain the approximate
amount of the days work was in vain
and i went to sleep in no enviable frame
of mind awaiting the morrows results

  it was half past ten the next morning
when he informed me

  we are bitterly disappointed the total
results of yesterdays work are about six
dollars and twenty-five cents

  great scott i thought my share a dol-
lar and thirty cents at that rate it
would be ten centuries before i could
secure my half-million and then the idea
came to me-could the professor who had
me at his mercy be deceiving me-that
he might take all fo himself

  when the suction wires were set he
needed no further aid from me might he
not keep them perpetually working and
me in ignorance of the result i promptly
disconnected the wires

  he soon telegraphed

  you have severed the wires that is
right scarcely more than one dollar of
fluid gold can be forced through each one
in a day not compensation for one one-
thousandth part of the power used in
obtaining it

  it was true that all our hopes were
frustrated all effort was to be abandoned
now i must be on my way back to the
surface once more

  well wired i the sooner you give
me directions to return the better i shall
be pleased

  a long delay and the professor an-
swered 

  my dear mr gough as heaven is my
judge i have never given sufficient
thought to your return

  great jove

  i had been such an absolute driveling
idiot actuated by the blinding thirst for
gold as to-rush headlong into an abyss
of a depth equaling the width of new
england without bestowing thought upon
my method of return

  true i had only bargained for a depth

of four thousand feet i had been about
that distance in the comstock mines but
here qfiarly three hundred miles of direct
descent with no thought of-my mind
wavered and for a time i was insane
with sorrow

  oh how i cursed the infernal infatuation
for gold here was i surrounded by a vast
subterranean sea filled with the precious
metal what could it do to relieve me
a fitting grave for greed

  then followed some bitter words

  what can be done

  positively nothing

nothing was more certain than that
my condition was unalterable-
i was doomed and already buried alive

  i pass any attempt to describe my feel-
ings for the next twelve hours

  on the morning of the third day pro-
fessor aldgeldt called me to the instru-
ment and made this suggestion

  i am more to blame than you also i
am the greater sufferer my years of work
wasted--how i wish i was in your place
i should at least be spared the accusing
thought of having doomed you to a living
tomb

  there is only one source of solace
grand men in the interest of science have
given their lives to the knife of the ex-
perimenting surgeon or the inoculation
of the poisonous microbe you are now in
a position from which no man has hitherto
been able to send back accounts of his
discoveries we are denied our gold

  you at least may obtain lasting fame
i some glory for my invention and the
power to recount your exploration go on
then my friend even to the extent of all
these miles of connecting wires and should
your life last you will be able to tell
the world through me of all those wonders
which the speculations of scientists have
but imperfectly determined

  history chronicles two hobsons one
was the hero of a naval exploit the other
famed in legend as the person who was
given but one choice my condition offered
nothing but hobsons choice

the plunge of the knupfen	

  i had to die anyway the store of pro-
visions would last two months my con-
dition would not be one of exactly solitary
confinement there was the companionship
of the telegraph and communication with
the upper world at any moment i would
enjoy my few remaining days in seeing all
i could

  i had consented-and again the knupfen
was boring through stone and lake and
rock at a slight diminution of its previous
speed

  i became reconciled to the situation
there was much to interest me in every
waking hour i admitted water from the
exterior through an orifice and found it
in the main fresh and wholesome

  from fear that my store of compressed
air would run short the professor in-
structed me in an easy method of making
a little oxygen from potassium with a
crucible the gas flowed through the
vapor of some boiling water and ab-
sorbed the nitrogen from some stalks of
the canned asparagus which with the
cooling effect of a minute quantity of ether
made a very agreeable atmosphere

  light is only relative-and in time i
became accustomed to the gloom and
could discern objects without the aid of
the searchlight it was indeed very curi-
ous in some of the vast subterranean
seas to witness the efforts of huge un-
couth monsters to follow the glare of the
search-light as i sped by them in my down-
ward course

  day followed day

  the professor had arranged matters
so that my descent was undiminished while
he slept with each twenty-four hours i
was reeling off nearly a thousand miles
but we were not able to determine to what
degree my course had varied from a direct
line as though our clocks remained in
accord i had no method of determining by
the sun how far i had swerved while pass-
ing through the various bodies of water

  and now there was a very perceptible
diminution in speed and the clicking of
the telegraph became fainter and fainter

  ith each hour i had reeled off three

thousand two hundred and some dd
miles when the knupfen burst into what
appeared at first to be a huge sea

  here all the water seemed transparent
and not materially differing from the water
of the surface i felt a strong current
and knew that my course was deflected
after three hours of this the knupfen
dropped out of it and into an open con-
dition of the light of day

  through the observation lens i could
discern what appeared to be mountains
dales landscapes and groves of varied
hues from light lilac to the rich crimson
of a jacqueminot rose

  as i looked out i might have been
in a balloon over some spot of fairy-land

  i tried to describe the scene on the
wire i had dragged from the reels over
four thousand miles i informed professor
aldgeldt that the great length of wire
had reduced the strength of the current

  no he answered in the scarcely per-
ceptible vibrations of the instrument you
are nearing the center of the earth the
positive and negative forces are nearing
their point of merger the attraction of
gravitation has almost terminated i can
only see the pulsations of your instru-
ment by the aid of a powerful glass
yes i hear you oh so faintly

  the knupfen ceased to move

  the positive center of gravity held it
still and without unduation

  i seemed to be suspended in a sort
of mid-air between those fairy grottoes be-
low and that sky of transparent water
above

  now i could see by the objects through
my observation-lens as i changed my po-
sition that the knupfen rocked as though
i were in a boat on the water i could
only see i did not feel the rocking

while it was evident that the floor
was at a slant of thirty or forty
degrees i stood straight out from the
floor like the peg of a top no matter in
what direction it moved

  a small scale put on board for the pur-
pose of weighing ore samples was stowed


famous fantastic mysteries

away on a shelf at the top i started to
step on a seat and reach up for it when
judge of my surprise as the mere effort
lifted me like a toy balloon

  as i raised the scale from the shelf
its avoirdupois was no more than that
of a piece of tissue-paper

  its weighing capacity was ten pounds
i placed it on the floor and stepped on
it i might just as well have put the tissue-
paper on the scale the balancing bar
simply quivered and rested yet when
i pressed my foot in an effort to raise
the bar it sprang to the top

  it was plain that effort was the only
thing that possessed weight

  i summoned courage and opened the
door to look out upon this strange world
within a world

  at a distance of what seemed a hundred
yards there appeared an object which was
an exact reproduction of the knupfen but
as large as a house this moved about and
danced in the air then suddenly dissolved
into a cloud of many-colored sparks

  in a brief time these sparks reassembled
imagine my surprise when they offered
a reproduction of the knupfen but this
time with the door open and a grotesque
figure of myself looking out nodding
winking leering and again disappearing
in a cloud

  these many-colored sparks continued
their performance with far more than the
effects of a kaleidoscope presenting a bit
of the fair landscape from below and
again three human figures one with a long
beard and other objects but always pranc-
ing dancing or grimacing

  i learned afterward that these were
the mocking-flies a great swarm of in-
sects each of a different tint comprising
all the various hues known to color and
who flew into position like the fragments
of a mosaic thus mocking and tantaliz-
ing whatever pleased their fancy

  as this wonderful swarm flew away i
could now see approaching what surely
seemed like human beings among them
i discovered the man with the long beard

  now this was a strange sight indeed

there were perhaps twenty of them they
separated and gathered like a flock of
birds- they were in every conceivable
position some were coming horizontally
and some with their heads downward and
their feet in the air

  breech-clouts of various hue seemed
their only costume

  they came on examining minutely
every part of the knupfen pulling me out
into the open continually jabbering in a
tongue from which i could occasionally
glean a word of old saxon

  but i must now tell you what wonders
befell me when i found myself outside the
knupfen at once i was like those others
it made no difference to me from which-
ever point of the compass my feet radiated-
far below was a ball of sapphire light
which might have been a sun across the
horizon was another ball of pale emerald
green which should be a moon in all di-
rections-above below right left and
everywhere-were little dots of sparkling
color which one would think were stars

  the man with the long beard ap-
proached his eyes were kind his face
benevolent though too young to be patri-
archal he seized me by the hand with
a welcoming shake

  the effort sent my legs in the air a
well as his own and we continued in
converse with our heads together and our
feet at a tangent like the spreading prongs
of a pair of tongs

  in a brief time i found we were able to
make ourselves understood each to the
other he spoke a sort of cross between
english and scandinavian

  my first inquiry necessarily was

  how came you here

  i might equally as well ask you how
you and others came upon the surface
of the earth he answered but that
would be a much more difficult and far less
reasonable question to answer than your in-
quiry all those of us who were not born
here came by the maelstrom off the coast
of norway

 how

  the ships that are swallowed within
the plunge of the knupfen



its vortex are drawn swiftly to the cen-
ter the plunge is so rapid that the air
below deck has no opportunity to escape
the descending water when it passes the
portals of the inner shell is thrown by
the centrifugal force of the earths revo-
lutions against the outside much as you
see the water mass against the side in a
rapidly whirled bucket usually nearly
all survive the voyage

  how do you live

  we live as do the fish-we breathe
our food all parts of this ozonic sphere
are pregnant with life-prolonging power
nor are the pleasures of the palate denied
us just here near the center the condi-
tions are comparatively neutral

  but i will take you to dells and grot-
toes where you shall enjoy in perfection
all the sensations of gastronomical de-
lights from exquisitely cooked game to
the pungency of rare cheese supplemented
by the exhilaration of choicest vintages all
comes with an effort of your will

  i paused here to say that shortly after
in the delightful company of a most
charming lady i passed completely
through one of these ideal banquets taken
in as do the fish by the way of the gills
and all without the necessity of tipping
a waiter or the jarring effect of changing
dishes

  i have not the time to recount the
many wonders each moment offered

  this heart of the world was called
aquavolant-flying-water

there was a great lodestone in the
grotto of extremis to which they
journeyed at long intervals the proper-
ties of which renewed their vitality but
one death had been known and he poor
fellow took his own life through violent
jealousy

 my friend whose name was harold
oleson came in the year  he was
accounted the ablest scientist from him
i learned the natural solution of many
of the wonders additional wrecks from
time to time had kept them fairlyron-
versant with the external world

  the oldest settlers came with one of
caesars galleys some years bc the
galley had separated from its consorts
during a storm at night in the english
channel and so sailed on to the maelstrom

  by far the greater number were scan-
dinavians

  friend oleson informed me that the
light of day came from the focusing of
the earths volatile electricity that the
apparent sun moon and stars were re-
flections of the real solar system with-
out transferred through minute globules of
vapor like the mirages seen on the sur-
face

  he took me to his laboratory and
showed me how through vaporous reflec-
tion he was able to determine the con-
stantly creating new chemical combina-
tions within the earth

  he pointed out the encroaching of great
veins of quicksilver forcing a way through
fissures toward the vast sulfurbeds under
heel a

  he explained that this was creating
a prodigious quantity of sulfurate of mer-
cury one of the very highest explosives
and that the result of the next eruption
would be to disrupt and throw out into
space in one huge body england scot-
land and ireland when they would un-
doubtedly become a second moon to the
earth

  i could not help but think what will
the boers think of that and what will
be the ultimate settlement of the irish
question

  among my early acquaintances i had
the honor of a presentation to the one
most esteemed and who by common con-
sent bore the title of regina

  she is a very beautiful lady and is
the one with whom i dined she was the
only female who survived the arrival of
the roman galley

  she was the daughter of the nephew
of the great cicero and was early mar-
ried to claudius hesperius one of
caesars generals the galley offered too
little deck protection for the great mael-
strom plunge and many of its occupants


famous fantastic mysteries

perished among them the general her
husband

  on account of her great beauty she
was called from infancy pulchra and from
the fact of her early accompanying hes-
perius to camp she still hears the name
of pulchra and castra

  oleson warned me that the novel
method of my arrival had very much in-
terested her and that she was sure to lay
siege to my affections

  when i met her and saw the infinite
beauty of her face f twenty years the
exquisite symmetry of her form her soul-
ful eyes the soft charm of her manners
and listened to the sweet tones of her
enrapturing voice i succumbed completely

  in brief we have been married now
nearly a year and every day i find a new
charm in her personality which adds to
the fervor of my affections

  i kept up an occasional correspondence
with professor aldgeldt who told me that
the descriptions of my surroundings were
valueless as they were discredited and
yet they have wireless telegraphy the en-
tering x-ray and many things more won-
derful than my experience

  though without the new inventions it
was extremely well supplied with the con-
ventional implements of science he has
some crystals peculiar to aquavolant
which possess the power to focus and mag-
nify objects reflected through the earths
vapor atoms it took a long time to iso-
late an object on the surface which one
could recognize

  though the sun and moon seemed to
bear about their usual positions he felt
sure that they were reflected at a violent
tangent and offered no guide as to the
real position of any external place

  i suggested that we get the exact time
from professor aldgeldt at san francisco
and so establish the reflected suns posi-
tion

  he instantly saw the advantage of this
and we telegraphed the professor who di-
rected our movements he was to send
over the wire a single dot the letter s

which we were instantly to repeat to him
we did this and he informed us that the
transference to and from took nine and
one-fifth seconds the electric spark had
taken four and one-tenth seconds in reach-
ing us by this we were able to set our
time and calculate by the meridian of san
francisco

  the focus of the crystals was switched
toward the east to massachusetts bay and
back to worcester where feeling our way
around that city i was enabled to recog-
nize grafton and in time to see my par-
ents and one of my sisters who were eating
their noonday meal

  my wife came with me to see her new
relatives by marriage she then expressed
a great desire to return once more to the
surface and visit her own home it was in
vain to explain that two thousand years
had completely changed rome which was
no longer queen of the world

  to my great surprise oleson declared
that he believed it possible through the
agency of the knupfen the great central
lodestone would supply the power which
with the machine reversed and the rodent-
claws on top would he believed enable
the knupfen to eat its way back to the
surface

  by opening an easy channel a portion
of the inner sea might be so directed that
its centrifugal force would aid in the pro-
pulsion and ultimately toss it out like a
cork on the top of a geyser

  we promised to come back to aqua-
volant by way of the maelstrom

we first induced professor ald-
geldt to free all the wires from
above except one we secured some old
windlasses from the wrecks and reeled the
wires on them the channel was dug
ready for the gate to be opened the mo-
ment the knupfen had secured a foothold
the measure of its length

  there still remained in store enough
of food

  mindful of certain necessities on the
surface i filled an empty asparagus-can
the plunge of the knupfen



with rare gems superb diamonds rubies
and sapphires

  i had been eight months in aquavolant
and was about to leave it with great reluc-
tance it was the twelfth of last septem-
ber when we made our start all the in-
habitants old and young from babes in
arms to those of near two thousand years
collected to see us off

  the driving wires were attached to the
lodestone a separate wire for communica-
tion was run from olesons laboratory
when i placed our fate in his hands and
we bade all good-by

  the great door was closed and the fa-
miliar buzzing sound recommenced the
superior power of the lodestone quickened
our voyage and it was four days and four
hours when the knupfen spurted out and
fell flat on its side on a great plain

  the water continued flowing for ten
hours and then subsided i opened the
door-we were in the light of day

  all around us was a thin covering of
snow and ice

  by directions of oleson i plumbed a
stick three feet in height to a horizontal
spirit level

  at the suns noon i took the measure
of the sticks shadow falling on the level
and measured the distance from the sticks
base to the point of the shadow i tele-
graphed the distance to oleson he got
the time from professor aldgeldt at san
francisco and after calculating informed
me that we were  degrees west from
san francisco and just south of the six-
tieth parallel that we were in siberia he
would locate us by the crystals and tell us
of the nearest town

  the knupfen had carried me completely
through the earth

  on the morning i learned that we were
near thirty miles north of kadovsky on
the great siberian railway i made efforts
to get a sledge and abandoning for the
time the knupfen we were soon on the
cars and speeding toward russia

  at st petersburg i made sale of three
fine diamonds and procured some fashion-
able costumes for my dear pulchra

  she would listen to nothing but that
she should revisit rome thither we went
where her disappointment at the change
wrought by centuries vas complete

  she pointed out to me her former box
in the ruins of the colosseum where she
had witnessed the frays of the gladiators
and the sacrifices of the slaves she was
horrified at the wretched condition of her
beloved tiber

  i think nothing so completely contrib-
uted to her desire to get away from the
place as the fact that she could not find a
single soothsayer in the city

  we started on our way to take steamer
from liverpool pursuing almost the iden-
tical pathway that she had taken with
caesars army those many centuries be-
fore it really was strange and wonderful
to witness her point out some place where
they gave the gauls a peppering

  from the public she attracted no obser-
vation except for her extreme beauty
most people taking her for my daughter

  but when she dropped into reminiscence
they gazed at each other with puzzled
looks

  we have been in america now four
months and have visited my parents at
their home

  at boston we cannot help but feel a
sense of superiority for we know who
really are the aristocracy of the hub pro-
fessor aldgeldt has joined us and we pass
many hours explaining our wonders and
talking of dear oleson with his hundred
and sixty years who we feel is far down
there below over his crystals and fondly
watching our every move

  we have purchased one of the submarine
boats and are preparing to return to the
aquavolant next may

  we take with us the newest appliances
for wireless telegraphy and feel that we
shall perfect communication from the cen-
ter to the circumference sooner than others
will achieve whisperings over the ocean

  and now i may say if there are any
who would like to join us in the trip
they may advise me at the fifth avenue
hotel in new york
 the readers viewpoint

address comments to the letter editor famous fantastic mysteries  broadway n y

radio man is great

  ffm has in its short span completely won
me over the december issue was the best yet
we fans asked for a monthly we got it we
asked for paul and finlay and got them too
this is certainly a favorable reflection on
ffms desires to please its audience in which
aim it has succeeded admirably may it con-
tinue in this same fresh healthy spirit for the
years to come

  topping the december line-up was farleys
the radio man although id never had the
pleasure of reading his radio trilogy or part
of it before this i can easily see why the
old-timers persist in their raves about it its
great the type of story i-and a host of
others ill wager-have been waiting to read
again not the sterile heavy-science kind nor
the trashy plotless sexy kind either

  farley when he wrote the radio man had
a distinctly weinbaumish touch which i hope
he retains and utilizes for future classics to
appear in ffm close upon farleys heels
come marshalls who is charles avison  and
flints the lord of death of course the
conquest of the moon pool is in a class all by
itself and it becomes more engrossing every
installment how about the sequel to cum-
mings the girl in the golden atom soon 

  now as to your policy of choosing the stories
for re-publication i hold out for an unfixed
loose method of selection who cares if the tale
was written in  or   after all its the
story that counts the fact that it is a classic not
its age so make a nice balance of it give us
the older ones and the newer ones mixed but
they must be outstanding that should go with-
out saying

 as to authors whose works-the newer
stories that is-would be appreciated here is a
list they are of the semi-oldtime class and the
majority of them are still active

ing the radio man all the way was the
lord of death a crackerjack of a story
give us more of homer eon flint the con-
quest of the moon pool is coming along swell
and i can hardly wait for the next installment

a great story by a great author three cheers
to him all the other stories were great with

a month or even weekly instead of monthly

  the people who have already seen your maga-

if anything more frequent publication will make
it more popular

  hoping you will print twice a month i

good suggestions

  the third issue of your magazine has definitely
placed it among the foremost of the magazines
specializing in science-fiction of course the
reason is obvious the majority of your stories
are selected from the finest of argosys splendid
fund of fantasy


the readers viewpoint



  at present at least your covers lend quite
an air of distinction to the magazine however
i would like to see an illustrative one by paul
or finlay

  the illustrations were all exceptional paul
did his best work for some time while finlay
has yet to do a poor interior piece both artists
are supreme in the fantasy field mainly because
of the fine detail they put into their illustrations

  the poem this month was fine but then i
still think the authors biographical sketch idea
i proposed last month is worth a trial why
not put it to the readers decision via an edi-
torial note somewhere in the next issues

  please do not omit the readers viewpoint
department it is very important

  the stories themselves were of unusual merit
and rate as follows

  the lord of death was a fine inter-plan-
etary yarn but more than that it is a splendid
character study strokors tremendous personal-
ity relegated every other character to a re-
latively weak and colorless background the
radio man is also a fine interplanetary story
and promises the beginning of a wonderful
series part of which is radio beasts and
radio planet the second part of conquest
of the moon pool builds up to one of the
greatest science fiction classics merritt is one
of the few authors whose work does not lag
between parts

  lights and the diminishing draft are
truly gems of fantasy while not strictly science
fiction they nevertheless belong in f f m
the gravity experiment while having a
rather threadbare plot is very amusing

  who is charles avison is mainly an in-
credible network of coincidence with not a
shred of plausibility one of the most obvious
flaws was the failure of the earth astronomers
to discover the other earth through the ef-
fects its gravity would have on the orbits of the
earth-moon system

     how about baroturpinol

  read your december issue of famous fan-
tastic mysteries and thought it very astonish-
ing especially the diminishing draft

  i have studied the microscopic animal called
the parameba can such a thing happen to the
low animals is there such a chemical as
baroturpinol with such powers of shrinkage
if so write and tell me about it what are
some of the powers of salt over the growing
of an animal that has shrunk

  i am very much interested in this because i
am making a home study of this subject

wants cover picture

  concerning your fine new magazine famous
fantastic mysteries personally i cant think
of any magazines of this type that are any better
although there are many books on the market
so far your choice has been very good and i
cant complain

  i would like to see some departments in the
mag for all science-fiction or fantasy books
have some first of all i would like a readers
department every month second i would like
to have a section devoted to the listing of the
stories from previous issues in the order of
their popularity for it would be interesting to
see how these old favorites compare when they
are placed together and third i would ap-
preciate an editors department concerning the
magazine in general

  i see that you are running one of the radio
series now for which i am thankful

  a word about your covers i would ap-
preciate something more than a list of names
and stories something by finlay would be ap-
propriate he does his best work for your mag
and as long as- you have him for inside illus-
trations you might have him do your covers
how about some illustrations inside of stories
not just one at the start i hope you at least
start some of my proposed departments

norman knudson

dont forget garrett p serviss

  may i congratulate you on bringing forth a
magazine of fantastic reprints for which there
has been a crying need for at least five years
and perhaps ten i must confess that at first i
was up in arms over the moon pool but
then i had the book and did not know that the
story was in two separate efforts

  as for story selection i am sure that almost
any of the earlier stories published in the
argosy-all story will suffice and these old
masterpieces will still make fantastic readers
sit up and take notice

personally i cast my vote for anything by

a	merritt the peer of them all also all the
golden atom stories by cummings more
radio stories by farley and george allan
englands longer stories also flint and hall

  my one complaint is that f f m doesnt
come out oftener

  entirely too many of these worthwhile fan-
tastic novels have been buried in the files like
the ship of ishtar the blind spot
phantom in the rainbow dwellers in the
mirage etc etc

  also please do riot forget good old garrett
p serviss as you go along

  your book is worthy of all the support that
readers of the old all-story and argosy can
give it

  in fantastic i feel that you are really giv-
ing the public what we want at least those of
us who revel in the thrilling experiences of our
imaginary friends who so ably break the
monotony of our every day lives

  i think the whole staff of f f m can with
assurance run around the office slapping each
other on the back

  i lent my first copy to numerous friends-
one of the more avid readers did not return it
-and i want to keep each number so will you
be so kind as to send me a copy i especially
enjoy mr merritts stories

  thank you again for the grand fun ive had
to date

welcome to ffm

  another of the old guard speaks i welcome
f f m because although i have all of the
old different stories most of them are gently
falling to pieces time and termites have taken
their toll after twenty-five years

  from the letters i see that the right sugges-
tions are being made for reprints dont forget
philip f fisher however whose devil of
the western sea and fungus isle are gems

  as for my opinion regarding the classics
etc i still believe the blind spot to be the
finest single story abe merritt the most power-
ful single writer and three lines of old
french by merritt the best single short story

  may you prosper mightily you would find it
hard to believe what a wealth of tender regard
we old-timers have for the old tales and we
arent so old either

charmed with classics

  in my opinion famous fantastic mysteries
is the most important contribution to the realm
of fantastic literature that has been made in
years for a long time i have heard of the
great stories published long before the first
science-fiction magazine was printed of course
i wanted to read them but they were nearly
impossible to obtain now along comes f f m
and not only makes it possible to get the old
classics at a moderate price but gives the reader
the pick of the lot the ones that have held their
charm down through the years i

the general set-up of the magazine is very

good smooth edges give the later two issues a
more neat appearance the paper is good and
the type clean and sharp also the illustrations
have lufeen of an unusually high order you
seem to have used rare judgment in your choice
of the proper artist for each story finlay ex-
cels in the more fantastic and beautiful type of
picture and people paul is at his best when
depicting alien scenery or creatures-also ma-
chines

  the covers are quite o k as they are i
would not like to see them covered with lurid
scenes that would make one half ashamed to
be seen with the magazine however i have no
objection to cover pictures if you choose them
as carefully as you have inside illustrations

  the stories i like best were the moon
pool the witch-makers the
wimpus karpen the jew the
girl in the golden atom the
moon metal the radiant ene-
mies the diminishing draft and
the lord of death i wont rate the
radio man and the conquest of
the moon pool as i will wait till i have
all the parts before i read them

martin alger

likes interplanetary yarns

having critically read the first two issues of

f	f m and the many letters from the readers
in the november issue i am adding my sug-
gestions

  a	i was disappointed by the conspicuous lack
of feminine interest in all of the stories for
november i am still young enough and emo-
tional enough to believe that romance rules the
world and makes it a finer place to live in

  b	how about a little more of the i in
the authors viewpoint and less of the so-and-
so-told him and he told me idea

  c	though i am no great authority on fan-
tasy i do have my preferences and it tends
toward the human action packed adventure on
other planets and other worlds less of such
mind stuff as blades fruit of the forbidden
tree humor as portrayed in blind mans
bluff is excellent

  d	i believe the cover should be illustrated
even if a chap has to hide the magazine beneath
his coat as he sneaks down the street from
the drug store

  e	as time passes original stories should
replace the reprints entirely except for the long
serials at least two of the latter should be
run in each issue

  after saying all of this as constructive cri-
ticism i hope let me assure you that f f m
is o k with me

good friends agree

  theres extra pleasure   and
  extra smoking in camels 

north east south west youll hear the same
story one true yardstick of cigarette pleasure is
slow burning kenneth e nick knight below left
confirms the experience of millions of smokers when he
says one of the first things i noticed about camels was
their slow burning i figure thats why camels smoke so
much cooler milder and taste so much better howard
mccrorey adds to me camels slow burning means
extra pleasure and extra smoking per pack

   yes the costlier tobaccos in camels are slower-burn-
ing enjoy extra pleasure and extra value in americas
