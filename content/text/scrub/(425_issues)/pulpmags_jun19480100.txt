durga-rama snarled a command and panthra the lioness leaped at ki-gor clawing
at his eyes ki-gor tried to shift position    he heard arlenna scream   

the lost beasts
of tatamba

  by john peter drummond

    could a thousand crawling jungle monsters stop ki-gors
    safari to the stolen kingdom

ki-gor had been watching the
strange scene for many minutes
he had seen the black man fall and
die with the peculiar foam showing at the
corners of his mouth he had watched
the terrified movement of the boy who had
light brown skin and slim un-negroid fea-
tures he had watched the leopardess as

she first caught their spoor and crept for-
ward belly down along the drooping bo-
kongu branch

  so intent had the leopardess been on her
prey that she had not noticed the slight
stir of air like the passage of some mighty
bird as ki-gor swung in a wide pendu-
lum arc through the air one long supple


	jungle

arm holding a vine her eyes had not
strayed from the quarry as ki-gor
dropped lightly to a branch directly above
his well-developed toes giving him sure
footing without a steadying touch of his
hands

  as the leopard inched forward ki-gor
watched with grim intensity his hand
drawing the great keen-edged hunting
knife from his waist at last the leopards
tail stopped twitching her body became
rigid as it set to spring he sensed the
exact moment and leaped his tall form
plummeting directly in the cats springing
path

  ki-gor struck the boy with his back as
he fell knocking him face forward to the
ground the leopardess saw ki-gor at
the last instant but she was already
launched in the air unable to alter her
course she twisted snarling flinging her
feet to strike ki-gors shoulder it was
a movement as fast as the strike of a
jungle adder as fast as the lash of a co-
bra but quick as her movement was ki-
gor was ahead of it there was a subtle
lightning shift of his tall superbly muscled
body a weaving back a darting movement
of his left hand and his powerful fingers
closed on the great cats throat

  the leopardess was very large--taller
heavier than ki-gor himself from nose
to tip of tail she would have measured
more than eight feet and her velvet soft
fur covered a massive weight of steel-hard
muscle

  but despite that ki-gor held her at
arms length he seemed to be toying
with her as she herself had so often toyed
with baboons before killing them for the
pure joy of killing he held her at arms
length as her forepaws lashed in futile
arcs then suddenly he hurled her to
earth following her down swinging with
the knife

  the next second he was crouched with
one knee on her flanks the long blade
driven completely through her chest pin-
ning her to the earth

  he waited thus until the leopardess was
through swinging her paws in death agony
he watched the tension of living leave her
muscles then he removed his knee jerked
the strong hunting blade free and with

stories

considerable care polished the blade on the

animals soft fur

  only then did he look at the boy

  i am ki-gor he said speaking the
congo dialect in a voice that was singu-
larly soft like the rustle of night wind
through ochilla weed

  brend the brown boy backed slowly
away bronze-tipped assagai in his hands
staring at the strange man who stood be-
fore him it had all happened too quickly

for his understanding-there had been

the man dropping from nowhere knock-
ing him to the ground the sudden sharp
struggle between man and clawing beast
the swing of the knife the death-agony of
the leopardess-and now as a final won-
der here was this man of the light colored
skin claiming to be the mythical person
called ki-gor

  long ago brend had heard of ki-gor
in his native valley far beyond the eastern
purple rim brend had listened to ivory
hunters tell of a great man-animal who
called himself thus however none of
these men claimed to have ever actually
seen ki-gor and so he considered it only
another story to be told in the hours of
night when the fire burned blue-a story
to be followed by tales of tol-ab the spot-
ted crocodile and skaab the jeweled ele-
phant who was said to roam the primor-
dial fastness of the white nile

  and now here was this man in form
like a god in quickness and strength like
nothing he had ever seen claiming to be
the very man

  ki-gor laughed why do you stare at
me boy i am real here feel of my
flesh i am not some shadow of the sun
i am merely ki-gor the man who stood
on a limb and watched a leopardess plan-
ning to eat you for supper

  brend remained tense for a moment
hunched forward the assagai pointed at
ki-gors chest at last the quiet sincerity
of the white lords voice made him for-
get his fear he lowered the assagai

  ki-gor then walked to the fallen black
and bent over him he ran his hands over
his lifeless muscles glanced at the still-
open eyes at the flecks of foam at the cor-
ners of his mouth

  this man was poisoned
the lost beasts of tatamba



  no lie was not brend fingered his
assagai nervously raising his voice i
did not poison him i swear by the gods of

my people that i did not-

  boy i did not say you had you were
not terrified of him in life but in death
therefore you did not poison him i

watched it all-from above

  ki-gor walked through the knee-deep
ferns light-footed as the leopard-cat he had
just slain he laid his bronzed hand on
brends shoulder

 boy-who are you where do you

come from i know every native tribe
every cubit of this jungle that is my home
yet i have never seen a man of a brown
tribe such as yours and this black man

-the tribal welts on his cheeks are

strange to me it must be you have come
from a great distance

the boy did not look like a typical
african native his skin had a
strange olive cast his chin was rather
pointed with a cleft in the middle his
teeth were even and small his face narrow
his nose thin and high bridged his hair
wavy brown his face reminded ki-gor
of the carvings he had seen long ago in
temple ruins near the land of sho-nab
which white men called ethiopia

  the lad answered my name is brend

i	am from a valley called ramfis eight
days travel from the rising sun i do not
know where i am or why i was brought
here only kal-ab could answer these
questions and he is dead

  why would anyone wish to poison
kal-ab

  he was not poisoned for eight days
kal-ab had only the meat he killed and
the fruit we picked i ate of everything
that he 

  some poisons are slow and some are
quick the tribes of bakele have one poi-
son made of white-veil spiders which
brings death in the space of twenty
breaths and another poison of dragon
toadstools which kills in fifty days i will
wager that your man kal-ab was poisoned
before he left the valley of ramfis
ki-gor then asked what is that tat-
too mark on your shoulder brend

  it is my mark of birth

  are all the children of your valley
thus marked

  only those of the kings line the boy
answered proudly

  from his first glance ki-gor had
guessed that this lad was not of ordinary
tribal blood there are many races cling-
ing to remote corners of the jungle and
such races may have kings and customs
dating to eras long forgotten

  is the king your father

  the king my father is dead

  you were next in line but you were
judged too young by the council of old

men-is it not so

  brend looked at the white lord in
wonder it is so he breathed then
it must be that you are the real ki-gor of
whom the ivory hunters told they said
that ki-gor moved by magic flying
through the air like the wind leaping like
an arrow of the gods they said he had
eyes that see beyond the most distant hori-
zon seeing things even in the minds of
ordinary men

  ki-gor laughed i have no magic
brend i merely guessed you see once
when gored by a rhino i spent many
weeks in a thing wthich my white brothers
call a bed while my friend a doctor of
the mission house at mbwela gave me
bitter medicines to cure me in the end i
was cured by an ancient black with a poul-
tice of leaves and bark but no matter-

while there i learned to read i read a
story like yours written in a book that

is all the magic i have-the memory of

that story and the guessing of yours now
tell me everything

  brend spoke i was born in the valley
of ramfis where my fathers people have
ruled as kings for more years than a great
tree has leaves my father king sandrak
died but a council of chiefs judged me too
young to take his place when i reached
my fifteenth year i could marry the girl
arlenna and rule as king for two years
now it has been so planned

  there is an old man ruling in your
place brend

  he is not old durga-rama is still

young-scarcely five-and-twenty why

did you think him old

  because the old are more wicked
	jungle

  durga-rama is wicked although
young brend compressed his lips and
doubled his small fists there was in his
attitude a hint of the man to be a glimpse
of the royal blood in his veins durga-
rama has always desired arlenna he has
always wanted to rule i have been a fool

to let him do this to me-let him steal

me from the valley but now what can i
do  how can i stop him  he will marry
arlenna and rule in may place

  they were startled by the sound of a
womans voice coming from the jungles
green wall

  it will not be so

  the boy spun around staring in amaze-
ment as a tall slim-waisted girl walked
into view

  she was beautiful her beauty seemed
almost fragile at first glance but there was
supple grace and strength beneath her
smooth tanned skin she wore a strip of
leopard fur leaving her slim waist free
revealing legs that were gracefully long
she came close to ki-gor stood with
shoulder pressed against the muscles of his
arm

  it could be seen how perfectly they
were matched that she was truly the
white lords mate helene

  a little smile touched her lips she kept
her eyes on ki-gors face sensing the re-
sponse of her jungle mate to brends story
of treachery

  ki-gors muscles seemed tense beneath
his tawny skin they were like drawn
springs which had waited too long for re-
lease he noticed helene looking up at
him

  he asked brend you could show me
the route back to your valley 

  you could not find it only kal-ab
knew the way

  a tiny man climbed rapidly down a vine
and skipped through ferns coming to his
armpits it was ngeeso the pigmy chief-
tain he cried who is it dares say there
is any spot in the jungle that ki-gor can-
not find

  ki-gor smiled he again spoke to
brend

  you say you traveled eight days

  yes

  always toward the west

stories

  each morning the sun rose at our
backs

  and on the third day did you see a
humped peak through the mists of the
north 

  it was so

  ki-gor nodded

  helene asked you have been there
ki-gor

  i have been to the blue rim of hills
which the spala natives call the ridge of
ngoi there is a pass which the spalas
fear to climb they have stories which
tell of a fierce race of great apes and of
tall black men who kill them with bronze-
pointed assagais he stepped over and
with a naked toe rolled the bronze-pointed
assagai that kal-ab had carried yes
that is the same place ramfis it has long
been known to hunters and traders though
its wealth was not enough so any would
brave the danger of trading with its na-
tives within five days-six at most-
i could be standing on its rocky rim and
he smiled if i chose

  helene could see the sparkle of excite-
ment in the jungle lords eyes the tense
eagerness in his muscles

  i will never tame you my ki-gor
she said softly

ii

the issue now decided ki-gor
was impatient to start the valley
of ramfis was a long journey even trav-
eling alone it would take him five days
with brend and helene along he would
be inevitably delayed and there was al-
ways a risk that the usurper durga-rama
would make arlenna his wife as soon as
brend was out of the valley

  ki-gor whistled twice in a low vibrant
manner and was answered a few seconds
later by a rumbling elephant call from
some place back in the deep bush they
could hear undergrowth crashing the
shaking thud of heavy feet and soon a
huge elephant came into view his trunk
swinging like a pendulum between gleam-
ing tusks that would have been worth a
small fortune to the ivory hunters of
europe

  brend trembled and commenced to run
the lost beasts of tatamba



for there is no beast of the african jungle
more feared than a bull elephant such as
this but ngeeso the pigmy streaked up
behind the boy and pulled him back

  have no fear brown boy behold
it is marmo see the man marmo calls
his master

  ngeeso pointed with triumphant pride
as the huge tusker came to a ground-shak-
ing stop and sank on front knees before

ki-gor curling his trunk for the white
lords foot

brend returned with hesitant step star-
ing in wonder as ki-gor was lifted lightly
to marmos head the elephant would
have started off but ki-gors voice speak-
ing the swihili tongue stopped him

there are more to follow thou im-
patient mountain

marmo sank again to his knees waving
	jungle

his wide ears in understanding he coiled
his trunk again lifting helene

  come brend smiled ki-gor you
are of a line of kings you must ride in a
kingly style

  with ngeeso jabbing at his back brend
placed his foot on the curled end of mar-
mos trunk and was lifted aloft

  and now boy i must bandage your
eyes said ki-gor

  helene explained do not be afraid
brend we have a secret home that none
except the pigmies of ngeesos tribe know
about even though we trust you ki-gor
will let no one see the path that leads to
it

  ki-gor fixed a blindfold of leopard skin
around the boy eyes and marmo started
through the jungle despite his great bulk
the elephant moved gracefully along the
narrow footpath after a couple miles
there was a roar of falling water and the
feel of spray filled the air they were
nearing the cataracts and rapids of the
river

  a trail broke out in a clearing where
natives once cultivated cassava and mar-
mo waded belly-deep in cane grass be-
fore them was the river lashing itself to
a white fury over a series of cataracts then
splitting in rapids around an island the
island was narrow only a few acres in ex-
tent bowered over with huge trees beneath
whose vaulted tops only stray beams of
equatorial sun penetrated

  from a towering tree of the island to
one equally high on the near shore a
bridge of vines had been swung it looked
slim like a single spider strand at its great
height from below it could be seen
swinging slowly in the breeze that forever
blew up this wild stretch of river which
had not been looked upon by a half dozen
white men

  helene found the end of a tendril lad-
der and climbed swiftly as the others
watched from the ground she reached
the bridge and paused looking down a
tiny figure against the blue sky she
waved and started with swift certain
stride as the fragile bridge swayed be-
neath her

  but even such travel was too slow for
ki-gor he had speedier ways of cross-

st okies

ing to his island he lifted brend on his
shoulders cautioning him to keep a tight
grip around his neck then as though the
boy weighed no more than a ngila monkey
he went swiftly hand over hand up a ten-
dril to the high-swinging bridge there
he found a vine rope tied and ready he
untied its end pulled back stretching it
tight stood for a few seconds looking at
the river far below then calling a final
word of caution to the boy on his shoul-
ders he wrapped the vine rope around his
left wrist and leaped

  he swung down down with the swift-
ness of a diving eagle brend screamed
and might have fallen but ki-gor seized
him with his free hand the rope was
fixed to the exact center of the bridge
they swung like a long pendulum the
swiftness of their passage making wind
burn their faces and their hair straighten
out behind

  then they were no longer descending
they were at the bottom of the arc flying
level with the river its white-running
froth just beneath their feet and next
up up until it seemed they would never
stop at the very crest ki-gor laughed
and twisted about his eyes seeking helene
who was only a tenth of the distance across
the bridge and the next second he
alighted at the island end of the bridge
his feet touching the tendril and bamboo
walk as lightly as an eagle feather striking
water the crossing had been made in a
matter of seconds

  you are slow copper-haired one he
called to helene why do you choose to
imitate the ant instead of the hawk

  i choose to live and enjoy our island
home she answered

  ki-gor shook his head in wonder at
such an attitude for him a vine swing-
ing through the air of the jungle was the
last word in safety

  he made his way swiftly to the ground
and followed a neat path of pebbles
through an opening in the wall of green
he put brend down then and untied the
blindfold from his eyes the path led to a
tiny clearing with a small house at one
side the house was made after the white
mans fashion of logs and bamboo with a
verandah and a roof of bundled palm
the lost beasts of tatamba



  they went inside it had no furniture
in the general sense of the term but it
was cleaji and dry with numerous couches
of fragrant grass and a hammock of
woven vines where ki-gor liked to take
his ease after one of his journeys that well
might encompass a quarter part of the
dark continent

there was not a great deal to be
done in preparation for the journey
there was no food to take for ki-gor
and helene were adept at finding food
anywhere there were no plans to be
made for the master plan of the expedi-
tion had already mapped itself in ki-gors
brain for supper he ate a few strips of
pink antelope meat which had been hang-
ing in the cool shadows since the day be-
fore and he spent the hours of evening
whetting his hunting blade and assagai
point until either would cut hair that was
blown against them and to wrapping new

sinew around his mighty strongbow-

the bow that no man save ki-gor had
strength to bend

  helene watched these preparations in-
tently you act like one going to war
she said with a tone of alarm

  he nodded i have a feeling that i am
about to face great danger to see many
strange forms of death i cannot explain
it he indicated his heart it is some-
thing that comes to me-here

  they slept and in the morning they
left with blue mist still hanging over the
river the scent of the jungle rose around
them-the incredible fragrance of un-
seen blossoms mingled with pungent odors
of fungus and decay night prowling ani-
mals had gone to their dens and only a
chorus of birds and the inevitable chatter-
ing of monkeys interrupted the crystal
stillness of morning marmo went stead-
ily following a narrow footpath the sides
of his huge body brushing the narrow
jungle walls carrying with effortless ease

the ones on his back-helene brend

ngeeso and ki-gor himself

  from time to time without uttering a
word ki-gor would seize a low hanging
vine and disappear into the vast ocean of
treetops overhead marmo would trudge
on never glancing or waving an ear at

these strange antics of his master the
others would ride for what seemed a long
time then unexpectedly ki-gor would
appear dropping lightly to the elephants
back from the overhanging jungle

  that evening after being gone for
longer than usual on one of his mysterious
trips ki-gor said

  there is a clearing ten miles distant on
a little trail branching to the north we
will find fresh water there as well as
plantains and bananas

  it seemed incredible that ki-gor could
have gone so far even swinging from tree
to tree but after a long hours travel they
found the camping place exactly as he said

  next day was much like the first as
was the next and so on for five days
they were now deep in an unknown
jungle where swamp stretched for many
miles and trees with bulbous bases like
giant tulips grew from the water reach-
ing higher ground they found an ancient
footpath striking northeast through the do-
mains of shuli and bantu tribesmen to-
ward the close of the fifth day the camel-
humped mountain rose at their left and
on the sixth they saw a jagged horizon
purplish and remote through primeval
mists

  it is there cried brend standing on
marmos swaying back dancing on his
small feet from excitement it is the
ridge of ramfis ki-gors magic has led
us back by the identical trail that kal-ab
followed

  after sighting the ridge of ramfis ki-
gor hunted the remote back paths
of the jungle he turned over the guiding
of marmo almost wholly to helene and
spent practically his entire time making
long excursions through the treetops
scouting to make sure that the men of
ramfis would not be warned of their ap-
proach for the safety of brend and the
girl arlenna his coming must be a sur-
prise to durga-rama

  that night he chose to camp in a deep
ravine where a trickle of cool water flowed
from a mossy cleft in the morning he
awakened brend and the two of them set
out to survey the country

  they left the ravine and climbed slowly
through areas of thicket and scrubby trees
	jungle

half way up the ridge of ramfis ki-gor
sighted the stone and thatch huts of the
black guards who with their families
lived out their lives near the passes stand-
ing guard chiefly against bands of wild
mahkoor tribesmen who each five or ten
years sent raiding parties down from their
country in the sudan of south egypt

  ki-gor squatted in the crotch of a small
tree so perfectly concealed that one of the
great apes which frequented the scrub for-
est passed within an assagais cast with-
out detecting him ki-gor dropped to the
ground a few seconds later and found
brend trembling from fright

  boy what is the matter

  the ape did not you see-

  ki-gor laughed of course i saw
brend was serious even the greatest
black warriors fear to meet the great apes
see up above the guards stay always
near the passes they would not dare ven-
ture over where the country is broken by
caverns

  who are the warriors of your tribe
that they are terrified by a colony of apes

surely-

  they are not terrified said brend
with sudden loyalty they have been left
alone for hundreds of years because they
help us guard against raids by the mah-
koor

  in other words the apes keep their
place and the people of ramfis keep
theirs

  yes

  ki-gor pointed toward the ridge where
it was rock-jumble and gnarled trees

  if we were there we could see almost
the entire valley is it not so

  brend nodded if such a place could
be reached

  the ascent does not look difficult and
i must see what lies ahead

  but i told you the-

  yes the apes ki-gor nodded per-
haps those apes will prove to be our allies
before we are through brend

  you do not understand they are un-
tamed they make no friends- he looked
at ki-gor you do not intend that we

should-

  not we you are going back to the
ravine to wait with marmo helene and

stories

ngeeso i will go up the ridge

ki-gor looked at the sun he had
time for the journey before dark

  he paused for a moment to eat a strip
of uncooked zebra flesh afterward he
cleansed himself in the tiny stream tight-
ened the thong of his strog-bow and
slipped it over his bronzed shoulder made
certain that his quiver was filled with
heavy copper-pointed arrows

  the sun was dropping toward the vast
jungle of the west when ki-gor emerged
from the ravine and trotted with a long
effortless stride up a flank of the ridge to
the country pockmarked with trees and
covered with billows of gnarled trees the
wind was wrong carrying his scent to the
hills but that did not stop him he must
find a safe camp in the ape country then
cross to the valley of ramfis without de-
lay

  as he neared the crest he climbed more
slowly the assagai in his left hand 

 there were movements--shapes of

grayish black moving here and there
among the trees blending in color with
the basaltic rocks ki-gors keen nostrils
were distended a little catching the char-
acteristic unpleasant odor of the anthra-
poids he watched the earth noting the
droppings and the trails that had been
worn by centuries of hairy feet

  the way - became steeper here and
there he scaled sheer-faced escarpments
the rocky crest was now only an arrows
shot above he sensed the closeness of
danger and his hearing became more
acute he detected soft rustling move-
ments ahead of him and behind there
were red-lidded savage eyes watching
from trees and brush and rocks but ki-
gor walked on seeming to be as casual
and relaxed as ever

  then there was a different kind of
movement abrupt he sensed what was
coming and spun around a gray-black
hairy form was charging from behind a
twisted thorn tree a huge bull ape mas-
sive-almost on the scale of a gorilla

as ki-gor saw him the beast roared ris-
ing to his bowed hind legs throwing high
his massive hairy arms his yellowish
fangs flashing in the dim evening light
the lost beasts of tatamba



  with a movement of automatic quick-
ness so fast no eye could have followed
ki-gor slid the strong-bow from his shoul-
der fixed the notch of a copper-pointed
arrow the bow bent under his mighty
arm and the arrow was driven with the
force of a swinging axe

  it was a perfect shot the arrow en-
tered just left of the apes frontal chest-
bone plunged on to shatter the spine pass
completely through and bury half its
shaft in the rocky earth a dozen strides
beyond

  the ape plunged on for three desperate
strides he shrilled a death-cry and
plunged face foremost across the ground
he lay there chest heaving blowing red
foam from his nostrils so close that ki-
gor could feel his hot damp breath against
his feet

  a garbled chorus of sound went up from
the brush around as other apes jabbered
watching their fellow lashing in death
agony another bull bounded out and as
he rose to charge ki-gor smashed him
down with a second arrow a third ape
crashed out ki-gor spun fixing an ar-
row bending the bow  he hesitated and
watched with grim satisfaction as the bull
paused and retreated on all fours with his
ugly rump thrust high

  ki-gors arm relaxed he removed the
arrow dropped it once more into the
quiver

  here and there he caught sight of gray-
black forms slinking into the deeper shad-
ows he waited until the sounds of their

retreat became faint and the air was
cleansed of the peculiar taint of their bod-
ies then moving swiftly once more some-
times bounding to the crotches of trees
and away again he covered the final three
hundred meters to the ridge crest

  there after many days he looked down
and saw the wide valley of ramfis spread
beneath him

  the valley was broad and undulating
covered with jungle broken at intervals
by irregular patches of sudan grass the
patches of grass looked tiny from his re-
mote vantage point but ki-gor with his
acute sense of distance knew that many
of them were miles in extent gigantic
baobab trees grew here and there among
the sudan areas and in one clearing like
long-legged spider-creatures he could see
grazing giraffes

  through the center of the valley flowed
a river its surface gleaming like polished
steel in the last reflected light of the sun

  he was tempted to go on now that he
was so close instead he turned back
helene had been worried by brends talk
of the savage apes and he did not want to
cause her unnecessary anxiety

  he retraced his steps the apes giving 
him a wary distance darkness settled and
	jungle

he covered the final miles with instinct
guiding him through the black jungle
night helene brend and ngeeso were
sitting close to the comforting bulk of
marmo waiting

  ki-gor squatted on the sandy floor of
the cave for hours that night talking to
brend about the valley of ramfis

ill

like all places ramfis had its
good and bad men there was the
ruling class of brown men who had long
ago journeyed up the great river from the
land where all is desert and there were
black tribesmen like kal-ab the blacks
outnumbered their brown rulers by eight
to one and they were brave fighters but
through superior intelligence the brown
men kept them in virtual slavery across
the river brend said a tribe of cannibal
blacks called the batolo had held sway for
centuries sometimes the batolo would
cross the river and steal a woman or two
who were working in the ramfis yam
fields but generally they kept the peace
for despite their savagery they were no
match for the well-disciplined army of the
ramfians

  on the sand of the cave floor brend
drew maps of the valley the city and even
plans of the bamboo and ironwood houses
of the brown men while ki-gor watched
intently fixing each picture in his mind
brend told much of durga-rama of ar-
lenna the virgin and of his friend liike
the high-priest of isis he also told of the
danger that waited of the merciless treat-
ment accorded spies of the great arab
dogs which were kept chained to give
alarm when strangers entered the walled
city of the brown men and of the savage
lion panthra which durga-rama had
trained to guard him

  with the first sign of dawn ki-gor
left the cave he walked rapidly down the
slope toward ramfis as the scrub growth
was left behind and the jungle became
deep he seized a vine and swung to a tree
limb he moved from tree to tree swing-
ing in easy arcs

  he did not hurry he did not want to
reach the city of ramfis before dark for

stories

minutes on end he would pause and stand
on some high swaying limb perfectly
blended into the pattern of the jungle
watching for some telltale movement he
could see none

  when evening came ki-gor was close
to the city of ramfis hand over hand
he climbed the huge branches of a baobab
tree and perched near its top to watch

  all was as brend had diagramed there
was a large native village of thatch huts
a circular stockage enclosing the more pre-
tentious houses occupied by the brown
rulers he recognized from brends de-
scriptions the palace of durga-rama the
ampitheatre where gladiators of the black
race often fought on feast days the temples
of isis and ra with the house of high-
priest liike standing between them

  he mapped his course he would scale
the stockade on the far side where large
trees of the jungle crowded close once
inside he would cross to the shadow of
the inner stockade which circled durga-
ramas house and enter liikes house
from the rear his chief worry were those
great arab hounds of which brend had
warned him they might catch his spoor
and commence howling their alarm

  darkness settled he dropped to the
ground passed through the soft wet earth
of a millet field commenced circling the
native city tom-toms were beating and
he could see oiled black bodies dancing
around a fire there were no brown men
dancing of course they looked with dis-
dain on such pleasures preferring to lie
on reed couches and drink a sweet pink
wine concocted of the juice of sugar palms

  there were watchmen along the stock-
ade sometimes ki-gor passed within
long assagai reach of them but so silent
were his footsteps so stealthy was every
movement that his presence was not once
suspected

  ki-gor paused on reaching the far side
it would be easy to scale the stockade when
the guards were not watching but there
was always a danger that one of the dogs
would scent him and raise the alarm

  he moved back in the shadows of the
great trees planning another course one
of these trees towered far above its fel-
lows he climbed it examining the long
the lost beasts of tatamba	

ropelike vines that stretched from its high
branches none of them swung with suf-
ficient freedom to suit his purpose so he
cut one and tied it near the end of a
middle limb he grasped the vine swung
himself in a wide gentle arc at the crest
of his swing he released his grip sailed
clear of the stockade alighting in the deep
shadows far beyond

  he stood close against the inner wall
which surrounded the house of durga-
rama the guard was a short assagai
cast away standing with his back turned

ki-gor started away-stopped a huge

gray dog emerged in the starlit yard the
dog snarled lunged towards him and was
brought to a sudden stop by a chain around
his neck

  ki-gor whisked the strongbow from his
shoulder fitted an arrow released it
there was a thud as it struck the dog
had commenced to bay but the sound
changed to a whining gasp as he fell

  ki-gor waited back pressed against the
wall the guard was turning assagai
ready in the bend of his arm he was
peering toward the spot where the dog lay
he evidently could see nothing he prob-
ably would not even have investigated had
not something else caught his eye

  a tiny man had climbed the stockage

and was balanced on its crest the guard
shouted a word in his tribal tongue and
charged forward with assagai pointed for
a second kigor did not realize the small

mans identity then he saw-it was

ngeeso the pigmy

  ki-gor-you must return the apes

--there are hundreds of them we saw

them creeping through scrub-brush by
sunlight even marmo fears

  ki-gor seized the little man tell me
ngeeso is helene  

  she was still safe when i left she did
not want me to come but i know danger

when i see it ki-gor--

  you do indeed my brave ngeeso
he started back toward the stockade
and then saw the guard the fellow had
stumbled over the dead dog and was
crouched on one knee examing the ani-
mal he found the arrow tried to remove
it it came free only after he had braced
his feet and pulled with both hands he
stood with the shaft staring he had evi-
dently never seen such an arrow-its

copper head the size of a mans palm its
shaft the thickness of the thumb
hoo-ee came his shriek of alarm
ki-gor and ngeeso were moving with
swift silence a patch of starlight sepa-
rated them from the wall
	jungle

  a rear gate of durga-ramas palace
opened a man stood outlined in the slice
of pale light a thick man with vast shoul-
ders he wore a robe of white cotton and
around it a flowing scarlet scarf he led
a massive lion on a leash

  ki-gor knew that this man must he
durga-rama himself and this lion the
mighty panthra

  durga-rama had been drinking wine in
the civet-scented luxury of his home he
was so close that ki-gor caught the scent
of it on his breath due to the wine which
had somewhat dulled his senses durga-
rama might have passed without seeing
the white lord even though they were
so close but panthra turned snarling lift-
ing one front paw

  panthra roared durga-rama jerk-
ing the huge animal back

ki-gor could have killed the lion at
that moment with an arrow from his
strong-bow but he still had hopes of
avoiding a general alarm he moved to
one side skirting the wall he stopped
a dozen guards were coming assagais and
elephant hide shields waving he turned
the opposite way more guards durga-
rama was bellowing orders

  there was only one way he would
have to scale the wall to durga-ramas
yard he leaped to its top thrusting his
leg so ngeeso could seize it and clamber
after him

  the pigmy chief caught his ankle but
his fingers slipped and he fell backward to
earth the guards were there they
rammed and fought each other in an at-
tempt to get their hands on the pigmy
he struggled eluding them along the
ground

  escape escape without me ki-gor
he hissed

  no little friend ki-gor answered

  he leaped into the mass of struggling
guardsmen it was dark but he located
ngeeso still struggling along the ground
ki-gor flung men from his way he bent
seized the little man and flung him bodily
over the heads of the guardsmen

  run run little chieftain he shout-
ed you must go to helene and brend

  durga-rama had freed the lion and it

stories

came roaring forward eyes on ngeeso he
saw ki-gor and paused this he could
see was his real assailant this strange
white man the pigmy on the ground could
wait

  panthra faced ki-gor hesitated a frac-
tion of a second with muscles tensed and
belly dragging the ground then he
sprang fangs hungry for ki-gors throat

  always before when panthra had been
set on a human quarry it had been easy
men always put out their hands trying to
fend him off but panthra with his strong
front paws had swept aside such puny ef-
forts at defense his leap would carry him
on taking man to earth his teeth would
close on the throat there would be a
crunch of bones and the man animal would
become a limp mass of flesh that was

the real sport for panthra-to slam the

helpless creature to shake him the while
feeling the good warm blood running in
his mouth

  but this time it was not the same this
white man did not retreat as all the others
had instead he had actually moved for-
ward to meet the charge

  panthra swung his paws to brush aside
ki-gors hands the hands were not as he
expected only empty space it threw the
lion off by an imperceptible degree for a
ragged fraction of a second he was off
balance pie tried to shift the direction of
his spring in mid-air at that moment a
hand came quick as the strike of a snake
closing like a steel trap on his left foreleg

  panthra twisted trying to free himself
he lashed with the other paw it was the

movement ki-gor expected-that he

wanted

  he seized the other leg and flipped the
great beast over in the air side-stepped
and slammed him on his back to the hard-
packed earth

  for a short click of time panthra was
helpless ki-gors hand streaked from the
scabbard at his waist his long-bladed
hunting knife making a blue flash in the
starlight

  he pounced forward to drive the blade
through panthras heart 

  but quick though the jungle mans ac-
tion was the ragged second of his advan-
tage was too short panthra twisted to his
the lost beasts of tatamba



side and struck at the knife hand with a
hind foot

  had the dagger-claws of that foot taken
hold they would have ripped skin and flesh
from the bones of ki-gors forearm a
subtle shifting of ki-gors body saved him
he was at one side feeling only the sting
of the sharp claws as they brushed him

  he was crouching forward knife in
hand panthra snarled and came to his
feet the savage lust of battle was strong
in ki-gor he forgot the others forgot
the dozen assagais at his back forgot
durga-rama himself a warrior and strong
as an ape

  panthra retreated reaching back with
slow tense legs his mouth snarling open
revealing his yellow fangs now for the
first time in his savage existence he felt

fear-fear of the tall white man whose

quickness and strength was greater than
that of a jungle animal

  ki-gor started forward knife ready-
but there was a pin-prick of an assagai
point in his back just over the heart he
stopped short and stood rigid

  one move you die a heavy voice
snarled behind him

he did not move he knew the words
were true death was only an as-
sagai-thrust away

  he lowered his knife turned slowly he
could not see ngeeso the pigmy must
have escaped panthra retreated yet a
couple of steps lay on his belly eyes like
yellow coals tail licking back and forth
native guards with assagais leveled made
a circle durga-rama elbowed his way
through and stood with hands on hips
powerful legs spraddled wide

  who are you that you call yourself ki-
gor he sneered

  ki-gor did not answer he looked at
durga-rama judging his qualities as they
were written in his face

  he was not old-perhaps thirty years

although short he was heavy and as mas-
sive of muscle as ki-gor himself his
eyes were small but they were quick and
crafty the assortment of gold and copper
ornaments on his arms and fingers told
ki-gor that the man was vain his per-

-jungle-winter

fume of civet indicated that he fancied him-
self as a lover his sneering smile was
proof that he thought himself extremely
clever

 answer me roared durga-rama
who are you to refuse an answer when
you are questioned by the king of all ram-

fians and that dwarf who escaped-

why did he call you by the name of ki-
gor

  the jungle man answered ki-gor is a
legend believed only by fools i am bondo
the hunter i came to your valley seeking
friendship and you meet me with lions
fangs and the points of assagais

  ki-gor was not tempted to reveal his
identity it would only lead durga-rama
to doubling precautions to prevent his es-
cape the name bondo which was a
term of respect given him by buto tribes-
men would serve well enough for the short
time he intended to remain in captivity

  durga-rama kept looking at him with
his crafty little eyes he stepped forward
to took the strong-bow from ki-gors
shoulder he lifted it hooked his fore-
finger in the thong and with a heave of
his muscles bent it slowly back ki-gor
watched with composed features as
though it were an everyday occurrence to
meet men with strength to thus half bend
his bow

  it is true that the white lord called
ki-gor carries such a bow as this durga-
rama said craftily it is perhaps unfor-
tunate you are not ki-gor otherwise i
might take you inside my palace and feast
you as it is i must lock you in the
prison

  i do not fear your prison

  good and perhaps you will not fear

the things i am planning for you-you

the man who would dare swing a dagger
at my royal lion

  he spoke to a leader of the guards in
a language ki-gor did not understand
and strode over placed the leash once
again on panthras neck and led the ani-
mal through the gates to his palace

  the blacks bound ki-gor with many
strands of grass rope and thus with only
his legs free to walk he was taken through
the gates of the arena

  the guards stopped there muttering to
	jungle

each other keeping ki-gor surrounded by
their spears one of their number started
away at a run and came back carrying a
blazing faggot

  he held the light overhead and ki-gor
could see a circular wall of close bamboo
pickets twenty feet high and above the
seats where spectators could safely watch
the struggles of men and beasts they
turned right to a doorway the torch-
bearer went ahead lighting the way down
a series of damp stone steps there be-
neath ground was a passage and a row of
little cavelike rooms with ironwood doors

  the torch-bearer swung one of the
doors open on its creaking hinges guards
jabbed assagais in ki-gors back and he
stooped over to enter the room the door
closed behind him he could hear a thump
as the bar dropped in place

  he stood his head just touching the
low planked ceiling the room was tiny
had his arms been free ki-gor judged
that he could have spread them and
touched both walls at one side was a
shelf dug into the dirt which served at
once as a bed and a chair

  ki-gor sat down the torch had been
thrust in a crevice of the wall out in the
passageway and through the copper grat-
ing he could see a couple of the guards
peering through

  he twisted his hands trying the ropes
that bound him it had not been a skillful
job of tying he could have freed himself
had he wished but there would be no pur-
pose in it with the door locked and guards
watching so he sat still waiting

  the dungeon was close prisoners had
been there many times but in years it had
not been cleaned the bones of animals
that had been tossed them as food lay rot-
ting and noisome on the floor

  distantly he could hear the sounds of
the tom-toms the weird chant of warriors
executing the native dances

  after a time ki-gor said to the guards
do your people never sleep or do they
dance on forever

  one of the guards grinned through at
him his strong teeth showing in the fad-
ing torchlight

  perhaps they dance for your death

  and when do i die

stories

  tomorrow did not durga-rama tell
you you will die for the pleasure of his
wedding-feast

  ki-gor knew he must escape he must
escape quickly he must somehow get to
the high priest liike to tell him that
brend still lived liike was a man of
power and he would use his influence to
see justice done

  and how am i to die asked ki-gor
you will die as durga-rama told you
you will fight the great ape zag in the
arena above us

  what weapons will i have

  the weapons your mother gave you
when you came into the world your
hands

  have other warriors fought this ape
with their hands

  the two blacks laughed at this one of
them said

  twelve times since the great ape was
captured on the ridge there have been war-
riors turned in the arena with him and
twelve of them made food for the hounds
but a man does not have to win all he
needs do is escape you see white man
there is a peeled palm pole smeared with
fat if a warrior can escape climbing
that greased pole then he is the ehosen of
isis and can sit at the right hand of dur-
ga-rama and be given the honors of our
greatest warrior for one day

the second guard stamped his bare foot
on the floor laughing ho do you think
you can escape by that pole bondele
perhaps i will kill this ape of yours
and that brought shouts of merriment
from both of them

  ki-gor asked when is durga-rama
to marry

  i have heard he will take the maiden
arlenna to his couch before the  sun sets
thrice

  three days

  ho there will be much feasting
white man and you will be part of the
feast this brought new laughter new
assagai pounding as dust rose from the
floor you will be a fine meal for the
hounds white man

  ki-gor sat back listening to the contin-
uing throb of tom-toms as the dance went
on in celebration of durga-ramas ap-
the lost beasts of tatamba



proaching coronation and marriage at
last he lay down and slept

  the tiny room was still gray with dark-
ness when he awoke but rays of reflected
light shone through the copper grating
and he knew by that it was morning he
stood moving his hands inside the rope
bonds he stepped to the massive door
but the guards were still there

  how is the fighter of lions this morn-
ing their leader asked thrusting his
ugly tribal-scarred face close to the grat-
ing when ki-gor did not immediately
answer he went on i bring you great
news bondele you are to be honored
in what way

  you are to be taken for final judg-
men before durga-rama himself

  the guards ranged themselves on both
sides of the door weapons ready the bar
was then lifted and ki-gor walked out

  how long has durga-rama been your
king he asked in an off-hand manner as
he climbed the stairs

  for three seasons

  so long

  there was another-a boy a weak-
ling but he is gone the gods have been
good and stole him away durga-rama
has not worn the crown but he will after
his feast of marriage two suns from now
and what if the gods bring this boy
king back

  you are a fool and a bondele said the
officer twisting his notched lips making
his nostrils flare over the copper nose ring
he wore the boy king will not come
back it is the word of durga-rama

iv

ki-gor was taken outside his hands
were tied there were guards on all
sides of him the arena gate was open
and a cage of heavy bamboo poles waited
he bent entered the cage he sat on its
floor with head and shoulders hunched
against the low tap the door was closed
and double-latched four porters lifted the
cage and carried him through the town for
dancing paint-smeared natives to see
they spat at him flung chunks of dirt fol-
lowed him back to the gates of the brown
mens city

  the cage was carried inside the house
of durga-rama up a flight of rude stairs
and inside the private rooms of the usur-
per

  ki-gor peered through the slats of the
cage and saw durga-rama himself squat-
ted on a heap of thatch eating a cassava
and palm-nut concoction with his fingers
behind him panthra lay crouched gnaw-
ing a joint of freshly killed goat

  the door was opened and ki-gor
stepped out standing with a height that
made the ceiling seem low panthra scent-
ing the hated white man roared and
lunged forward his yellow eyes on ki-
gors throat a sharp word from durga-
rama froze the action and the lion
crouched back his tufted tail whipping
the matted floor

  durga-rama wiped his greasy hands on
thatch and smiled showing a set of teeth
turned brown by the chewing of betel nuts

  bonda he said using the name ki-
gor had given him it is well that such
a mighty warrior as you should call on
me

  i was brought in a cage did you not
notice 

  my people wanted to see you said
durga-rama picking his teeth with the
nail of his small finger it is not often
that they see a warrior so mighty he fights
lions with one bare hand and a knife

  why have you brought me here

  to tell you of the honor that is to be
yours durga-rama hunched his huge
shoulders forward and again showed his
betel-stained teeth last night you said
the name of durga-rama was spoken from
the land of the white nile to the hills of
kenya is it not then an honor when you
are chosen to fight zag the great ape at
my wedding feast

  i would fight your coward lion in-
stead

  durga-rama bent forward hand on the
hilt of the crescent shaped scimitar at his
waist

  do not anger me white man or you
will die like a slave at the fire and your
carcass will be thrown in the river to be
eaten by crocodiles or by the cannibals of
batolo

  you fear me durga-rama otherwise
	jungle

you would show your strength by fighting
me yourself

  i fear no man nor does my lion pan-
thra he sat there the corners of his
mouth drawn down he reached and
stroked panthras massive head the lion
received the caress but made no return
show of affection he had been tamed
through fear not love and someday he
would turn on his master it was always
thus with the great cats

  durga-rama said i do not toss pan-
thra into the same arena with every rene-
gade warrior you will have to content
yourself with our fighting apes they
will be savage enough for you ill wager
and if you prove a coward as i suppose
you will there will be a way of escape
there will be a pole three times the height
of a man that you may climb to the wall
he spoke to his men gesturing sharply
with a greasy hand throw him back in
his dungeon

  again in the dungeon ki-gor sat with
his back against the dirt wall waiting lis-
tening to sounds of natives drunk on mil-
let beer he thought of brave little ngee-
so wondering if the pigmy had escaped
he thought of helene of her danger

  a pot-bellied slave of a bantu came
down the steps carrying an earthen pot a
slot was opened in the door of ki-gors
cell and a heap of vile-smelling offal was
dumped inside on the dirt floor

  your food master grinned the slave
showing rotting teeth

  ki-gor took the insult without flinching
he was immovable as a bronze god he
waited in the foul hole as the day passed
he closed his eyes resting himself so he
would be at his best for the ordeal sleep
came as the stultifying heat of afternoon
settled then suddenly he awoke

  men were shouting he could hear
tramping feet above it was the crowd
entering the stands that circled the arena
the games were about to commence

  get your sleep white man grinned a
guard through the grating you have yet
a while to wait there are to be other
fights yours is merely the last

  the noise increased after an extended
wait ki-gor heard the sound of warriors
fighting with boo sticks there were re-

stories

sounding whacks as the clubs struck home
the cheers of savage blacks the laughter
of the brown men following that en-
gagement a wild boar was turned in with
a lancer and killed and by way of diver-
sion two drunken hags clawed each other
with their fingernails

   the hags were finally chased out and
an expectant silence settled the guard
peered through at ki-gor other faces
appeared the leader of the guards strode
down the stairs and came to the door el-
bowing his subordinates aside

   it is your time bondo he said are
 you ready

   i am ready answered ki-gor

h

the bar was lifted and the door
creaked open on wooden hinges ki-
gor stepped out arms still bound at his
sides

   free him said the leader

  two of the guards fumbled untying
the knots the ropes were unwound and
ki-gor stretched himself shaking the
kinks from his magnificent muscles for
a moment there were no words spoken
guardsmen looked at him in hushed awe
never before had they seen a man of such
proportion of such strength

   the king must not be kept waiting for
 you white man said the leader

   ki-gor climbed the steps crossed a nar-
 row passage lined with bamboo pickets ten
 feet high and lashed across the top walked
 through a gate to the arena

  he stood for a moment allowing his
eyes to accustom themselves to the bril-
liant late-afternoon sunlight then with
a single sweeping glance he took in the
features of the scene

   the arena was about a dozen strides in
 diameter roughly circular surrounded by
 a perpendicular wall about three times the
 height of a man above the wall safe
 from the highest-leaping beast of the
 jungle were the seats of the brown men
 beyond on a circular platform the blacks
 were jammed together in a solid mass re-
 splendent in feast-day paint and finery

   a roar greeted ki-gor as he came into
view then as the roar subsided taunting
the lost beasts of tatamba



voices made themselves heard bits of
food and pellets were flung at him strik-
ing him bounding to the dust at his feet
he made no sign of having noticed

  his eyes noted durga-rama gowned in
a white kuftan with scarlet sash panthra
lay at his feet lips drawn back from his
fangs his glowing eyes on ki-gor at
durga-ramas back was a slave waving a
long ostrich-plume fan and at his left
seated a few inches lower was a girl

  the girl was young-perhaps brends

tender age she was beautiful even
judged by the classic features of ki-gors

lovely helene she was beautiful her
skin was brown with a velvet texture her
eyes were very large and dark a thin robe
of cotton was drawn around her young
figure which was just swelling into the
lines of womanhood she seemed fragile
as a lotus leaf

  ki-gor did not doubt that this young
girl was arlenna whom durga-rama in-
tended to take to his couch in marriage

  ki-gor looked up at her and for a mo-
ment their glances met he saw compas-
sion in her eyes--pity for the horrible
fate that awaited him
	jungle

  durga-rama bent and spoke to her he
laid his hand on her shoulder had his thick
lips close to her ear she shrank a little
as though his closeness were loathsome
but she nodded quickly it was not a
pleased smile it showed that she feared
the man and her fear made ki-gor detest
him as he had never detested a person be-
fore

  ki-gors eyes traveled farther in scar-
let robes of their calling sat the priests of
isis and ra one of them gray-bearded
with sightless eyes sat in an elevated posi-
tion this he knew was the high-priest
liike-the man he had come to the val-
ley to see

  if fate went against him in his last ex-
tremity ki-gor would shout his message
to liike he would tell him that brend
still lived that he had been kidnapped
through the connivance of durga-rama
and that someday he would return but
that only as a last resort for the moment
ki-gor looked at the sightless liike with
no sign of interest or recognition

  ki-gor walked to the middle of the
arena he folded his arms his muscles
were long they rippled like the bodies of
pythons beneath his smooth tanned skin

  two black men ran in carrying a pole
it was the trunk of a palm two or three
inches in diameter glistening from a thick
application of grease quickly they placed
it in a hole that had been bored close to
the wall when in place it weaved uncer-
tainly its top within reach of durga-
ramas arm perhaps it would bear the
weight of a man such as ki-gor and per-
haps not but its coating of grease would
prevent his climbing it anyway the pole
was merely a bit of torture it would pro-
vide a comic spectacle for the mob if a
terrified man were to grasp it and try to
climb while the great apes clawed his flesh
to ribbons from behind

  one of the blacks made an announce-
ment the arena was cleared there was a
creak of wooden wheels outside a dozen
slaves and guardsmen were pulling a huge
cage it was rolled to a sliding door the
door was lifted the cage opened ki-gor
could feel the tenseness of the crowd as a
guardsman with a long pole poked be-
tween the bars of the cage to force out

stories

some surly animal there was a gasp a
cry of pleased anticipation as a huge gray-
black creature lumbered into sight it was
an ape shaggy and abysmal turning lim-
ber hands on long arms trailing in the dust

  zag zag screamed the crowd call-
ing the brutes name

  there was more shouting and poking
and another ape came out this one was
gombon evidently the two of them
remained near the entrance for a while
blinking dull red-rimmed eyes growing
accustomed to their new freedom

  if zag saw ki-gor he made no imme-
diate move to attack perhaps it took
some time for his dull brain to digest the
fact that an- unprotected man was there
then he opened his mouth showing pow-
erful yellowed teeth and let loose a gut-
teral snarl

  one of the guardsmen reached through
with a barbed lance sticking the animal
in the back the pain of the lance in-
furiated him he charged but the weapon
was quickly withdrawn and the huge
beast struck the arena wall making it
creak and wave

the crowd shrieked with laughter
at the spectacle once more the
lance this time from a new direction zag
beat at the walls with his huge arms in a
raging fury but the second ape gombon
merely stood by the gate rocking back
and forth on bowed legs his eyes on ki-
gor

  ki-gor still stood in the center of the
arena he seemed relaxed his face
was still composed still arrogant

  in his blind fury zags eyes fell on
gombon he rushed and suddenly stop-
ped only then did he notice ki-gor
he turned and charged with long arms
brushing the ground

  at a distance of two strides the ape
slowed and stretched high his arms he
pounced swinging them down with a
force that would have driven most men
to the earth a heap of broken bones but
when the arms descended ki-gor was no
longer there

  at the final moment he had moved
aside shifting with the quickness of a
leopard-cat he slid beneath one of zags
the lost beasts of tatamba	

descending arms the ape was thrown
off balance he snarled with froth drip-
ping from the corners of his wide mouth
enraged that his quarry had evaporated
from the earth in front of him with an
effort he came to a stumbling stop veered
his huge bulk around but ki-gor was
not there either zags half human voice
rose in a frustrated scream while his
claws tore at the coarse straggling hair at
his own chest and at that second ki-
gor saw his chance he sprang through
the air pouncing with knees on zags
back his hands feeling for the great
arteries of his throat to close off the blood
supply to his brain

  the apes arms beat the empty air he
turned flopping blindly like a monster
that had lost all sense of equilibrium and
direction he turned around and around
fell to the ground pawing over his shoul-
der trying to free himself of the ter-
rible thing that was holding like a leech
to his back

  zag rose to great heights flinging his
arms high in one final effort his hind
legs seemed very short and bowed his
chest became pointed his belly sunken he
was all massive shoulders and arms a
horrible distorted beast a thing conceived
in the mind of an angry god and born in
the furnaces of hell he flung himself
backward trying to crush ki-gor against
the wall of the arena

  ki-gor was jarred and zag succeeded
in writhing part way free he swung back
finding the flesh of k-gors shoulder with
his claws he raked three shallow fur-
rows from which blood came in quick
scarlet streaks but the jungle man did
not relinquish his advantage his fingers
still probed the soft recesses of zags
throat

  during this time the second bull gom-
bon watched dull eyed from a crouching
position by the gate he seemed to have
no interest in the fate of zag then
suddenly he scented the fresh blood flow-
ing from ki-gors shoulder it seemed
to whet his savage appetites he roared
and came forward

  the crowd saw him and was in ecstasy
now indeed would they see the arrogant
white man defeated he would no longer

be a conquerer riding on the shoulders
of their mightiest beast instead he would
fall crushed and mangled with broken
bones poking through his bloody flesh
they would see him become a limp and
lifeless thing they would see him tossed
about by the two apes until they were
tired of playing with him and finally they
would see the starved hounds of durga-
rama turned inside the arena to devour
him

  they watched as gombon paused with
hands uplifted directly over the back of
ki-gor they watched those arms de-
scend and close on his naked back they
cheered as gombon reared back the white
man in his arms tearing him off the back
of zag but what followed after that was
so quick that not one eye in the vast as-
semblage followed it

  there was a flash of ki-gors bronzed
body as he twisted suddenly gombone
arms were no longer around his body
instead he was thrust back those hairy
arms held wide and high by the hands of
the white man

  ki-gor released the hold leaped back-
ward landed on the balls of his feet knees
bent in a crouch then he moved side-
wise and sprang his fingers reached
funding the eyes of gombon a quick
twist of crooked fingers and the ape
was for the moment blinded

  gombon roared his voice rising higher
and higher until it became a shriek he
staggered arms lashing like some insane
monster he collided with zag and slam-
med him to the dirt of the arena he plunged
on falling and collided with the wall
striking it with such force it threatened to
collapse

  in their seats above the brown men
were shouting from fear danger to them-
selves-that was a thing they had not
reckoned with durga-rama stood hand
resting on panthras collar watching
while a scowl twisted his heavy face

  ki-gor backed to the middle of the
arena hands resting on hips stepping
nimbly to one side or the other avoiding
the blind rushes of the ape he waited
his moment finally the beast was di-
rectly between him and the greased pole
standing a full height hands pawing at
	jungle

his eyeballs it was exactly the thing
ki-gor had wanted he went forward
with two swinging strides he launched
himself into air one foot touched the
beasts back the next rested on his head
from that elevated position he sprang
grasping the grease-slick pole in one hand
while his toes siwung on resting at the top
of the arena wall

  for the second he balanced there pre-
cariously looking down on durga-rama

the usurper acted quickly he
snarled and whisked the heavy
scimitar from his waist he leaped for-
ward swinging the crescent-shaped blade
in a mighty arc it connected with the
pole cutting it in half just beneath ki-
gors fingers and the jungle man fell
backward to the deep dirt of the arena
below

  durga-rama waved his scimitar on high
and shouted down to his guardsmen death
to him death death

  black guardsmen were swarming near
the gate the metal heads of their assagais
rattling together they peered through the
strong bamboo pickets fearing to disobey
the command of durga-rama but fearing
more the fury of the savage apes and
equally savage white man

  ki-gor came erect and his eyes flashed
around the arena his attempt at escape
had been frustrated and now he could see
only death on every hand his eyes rested
on liike who had stood and was facing
down on the scene trying to piece it out
by hearing alone

  hear me liike screamed ki-gor his
voice rising over the sounds of the mob

  liike took a blind step forward i
hear he said in a harsh voice

  i have come to tell you of the true
king of ramfis i have come to tell you
of brend the boy whom durga-rama had
stolen from the valley and taken to a far
j ungle to die he is not dead liika the
real king still lives someday he will re-
turn   

  i hear i hear liika kept calling

  durga-rama leaned over the railing his
scimitar clenched in his hand an expres-
sion of black rage mottling his heavy face
he seemed poised there tempted to leap to

stories

the arena below to swing his scimitar on
the hated white man to cut off the voice
forever with its damning accusation against
him but his fear of the great apes was
too strong suddenly he remembered
panthra he spun around cut the leash
with a whip of the scimitar snarled a
command in the beasts ear

  panthra did not hesitate he saw the
hated white man below-and this time
there was no sharp knife to strike at
him with cobra quickness

  panthra launched himself into air a
shrill scream from the throat of arlenna
reached ki-gors ears he turned and
there was panthra poised above him

   ki-gor moved aside-one of those light-
ning movements that had saved his life so
often in the past panthra saw him but
he was unable to change the course of his
spring in mid-air the huge lion struck
earth on all fours spun started to lunge
again ki-gor was gone cleverly he had
shifted position placing zag between him
and the lion

  zag saw the big cait and writhed back
from fear sight was coming back to
gombons eyes and he saw panthra too
the two of them fled chattering their ter-
ror simultaneously their weights struck
the arena wall the bamboo bent creak-
ing it wavered a moment there was a
sharp splintering sound as one of the out-
side supports gave way and following that
a roar of collapsing wood mingling with
the screams of brown men and black

  a section of the wall had collapsed
the wall had served as a main support of
the overloaded stands above the stand
slumped forward pitching its mass of hu-
mankind toward the ground

  for a second the way was open it
was ki-gors chance to escape he sprang
through reached the gate ran to the cen-
tral path of the brown mens city

  only one guard was there the guard
recognized him and after a momentary
hesitation charged with his assagai lifted
high he set himself and drove the spear
at ki-gors heart but his quickness was
no match for that of the jungle mans
ki-gor sidestepped felt the bronze head
of the assagai burn past his chest his
hand streaked down seized the shaft and
the lost beasts of tatamba



with a powerful twist sent the black war-
rior rolling head over shoulders to the
ground

  the guard came to one knee shrieking
the alarm but no one could hear him
through the pandemonium that seethed
through the arena he still had a weapon
-a short-bow and quiver of tiny poi-
soned arrows he fitted an arrow in the
thong and drew back aiming at ki-gors
heart but at the same moment moving
infinitely quicker ki-gors long arm came
down driving the assagai the copper
head of the assagai flashed once in the late
afternoon sunshine aud cut the warrior
through the middle pinning him to earth
the cry of terror that rose from the war-
riors lungs ended in a death-gasp

  guards were running from their posts
around the arena now they came a mo-
ment after their companion had fallen
for a second they paused staring at the
tall white man as they would stare at some
evil spirit protected by the armor of the
gods

  ki-gor did not turn and run the fear
they felt of him would have vanished had
he done so and an arrow or a carefully
aimed javelin would have cut him down
instead he planted his feet wide and his
voice rose in a wild jungle scream of
triumph

  aye-ya he cried beating his chest
with forearm and fist hear me i am
ki-gor beast of the jungle

  many times they had listened to the
tales of ki-gor the great white lord of
the forests and now that mythical being
had assumed flesh in all his terrifying pro-
portions and stood facing them ki-gor
kept one arm upraised as though ready
to call down the thunder of the gods while
he backed slowly toward the ironwood
gate of durga-ramas palace

  the strength of that gate would have
defied ki-gors strength but he did not
need to open it with a vaulting spring
backward he reached the top of the eight-
foot wall he crouched there looking at
the blacks and still no weapon was lifted
against him

  durga-rama had by now broken free
of the terrified mob in the arena he
charged from the gate trampling men and

women he saw ki-gor poised there
and shouted

  after him you cowards

  when his men still did not move he
roared with rage and charged them with
his scimitar he cut down two
of them with the first savage swing he
rushed on scattering the guards before
him

  that man is ki-gor he bellowed
you hear me-ki-gor he has come
to conquer you and murder your women
death to ki-gor hear me i will
give a brown maiden to any black who
will bring me his head

  ki-gor dropped to the inner court while
he was speaking the sound of durga-
ramas bellowing seemed distant there
he reached the door it was barred he
drove into it shoulder first and it col-
lapsed beneath his power five strides
took him the length of the great hall three
long leaps and he was up the stairway
he burst inside the private rooms of
durga-rama only a slave was there-
a woman sprinkling fresh thatch over the
couches

  ki-gor saw his strong-bow hanging on
a peg his quiver of arrows nearby his
long-bladed hunting knife sticking in a
pillar

  guardsmen were inside the front door
he could hear them in the courtyard too
durga-rama was issuing orders organiz-
ing pursuit

  ki-gor fixed quiver and knife at his belt
slipped the strongbow over his shoulder
and climbed to the top of a thick bamboo
pillar supporting the roof he held himself
aloft with locked legs and dug his way
through the thick layer of palm thatch

once outside he crouched look-
ing at the scene below over there
was the arena with its seats half col-
lapsed one of the great apes was plodding
across the street of the native village
durga-rama could be seen waving his scim-
itar ordering his guardsmen to surround
the house

  for the time no one noticed ki-gor
crouched on the ridgepole above he stood
and ran along the narrow apex with the
same ease that he would follow a tree limb
	jungle

in the forest he speeded his step near
the end of the roof and with a bounding
leap he launched himself in air

  he seemed poised like a bird in flight
he sailed out a long distance and then
down down it appeared that he would
surely impale himself on the pointed poles
of the stockade he didnt he cleared
the stockade by inches and ran toward
the encroaching jungle

  no one was in striking distance except
a native archer the fellow sprang to a
perch overlooking the stockade his bow
and poisoned arrows in his hands from
over his shoulder ki-gor saw him still
running the jungle man fitted an arrow
to the string of his strong-bow turned
and drove the arrow it winged true
smashing the native backward as though
he was struck by a war-axe

  the vine was there as it had been left
the night before ki-gor seized it and
swung far out alighting on a branch
he swung to another vine and another
in a matter of seconds he was beyond their
sight in the leafy bowers of the jungle

vi

through the cool of approaching
evening he went with the breeze
fresh against his face the sun sank like
a ball of vermilion through the over-
hanging mists of the jungle by dark
the area of large trees was left behind
he was forced to travel a footpath he
was on the scab-growth of the hillside
when darkness settled

  here on higher ground the scent of
the great apes became strong it contin-
ued so as he neared the cave a sudden
fear knifed through him the apes should
not be this close if they had any great
fear of marmo

  he speeded to a run a gray shape
loomed before him shaggy and truculent
an ape the animal saw the jungle man
and retreated crashing through scrub-
brush

  ki-gor went on bounding in long
strides from rock to rock he reached
the crest there only an assagai cast
away was the big rock which marked the
mouth of the cave

stories

  he came to the black portal no fresh
spoor of ape there so he took a deep
breath of relief

  helene he called do you hear me
helene

  no answer only the rolling sound of
his voice echoing from the rock walls
helene he shouted more loudly
there was a stir of movement a sound
of hurrying footsteps it was not helene
it was such a sound as a small man or
boy might make a form took body in
the gloom-ngeeso

  ah ki-gor thou hast come cried
ngeeso in the pigmy tongue i escaped
as you told me and came here they
were already gone i followed their trail
into the valley and then came back in
hopes you would escape and meet me
here

  you did well ngeeso tell me at
what sun did you arrive

  at midday

  and how old was the trail

  only a few hours

  they will be safe ngeeso with
marmo they will be safe

  they left the cave and traveled through
night blackness down the rocky hillside
finally coming on marmos tracks in soft
earth a long arrow shot away a moon
came from clouds and it was easy
following the spoor along the zig-zag path
through scab-bush

  but in the deeper jungle no ray of
moon penetrated blackness was com-
plete ki-gor put ngeeso on the ground
and walked slowly bending forward
guided as much by his sense of smell as by
sight for an hour it was thus with the
men feeling tneir way

  one would need the nose of ngoi the
hungry leopard to follow such a spoor
ngeeso muttered

  patience little man

  what have you found ki-gor
nothing but i have a sense of mar-
mo being near

  ki-gor whistled softly the two famil-
iar tones instantly there was a respond-
ing movement in the deep brush a crash
a thunder of heavy feet shaking the earth

  ha he is there the mighty mar-
mo ngeeso shouted
the lost beasts of tatamba	

  ki-gor kept talking in a quiet voice
i am her marmo i am here thou
moving mountain-and his words in
shahili guided the great beast to his side

  marmo loomed a deeper shadow in the
dark he stopped and reached forward
with his trunk finding his white friends
shoulder curling it around him with slave-
like adoration

  where is helene ki-gor asked him

  the elephant had no power of speech
but his intelligence was exceeded by no
animal of the jungle save man himself
he understood the question ki-gor put
and did his best to answer

  marmo lifted his trunk high above
trumpeting with a quiet high-pitched
-sound he stamped his feet rocking his
massive bulk to and fro

  she left thee and the brown boy he
left too she told thee to wait for her
here

  again marmo rocked accompanying
the movement with a fanlike waving of
his ears signifying agreement

  she left at mid-morning marmo
you have stood here through the hot hours
she feared that they would see your bulk
those guards of ramfis and so she chose
to go forward without thee and now
she has not returned as she promised and
thou poor patient beast did not know
what to do

  what will thou do ki-gor asked
ngeeso you have not taught your
mate to be earth-bound you have taught
her to travel swinging through the trees
like yourself and up there none can fol-
low	

  she would not travel by trees with
brend along we will find their spoor
along the footpaths

  he went on slowly as before but any
spoor left behind was now too faint he
sat down with his back against the trunk of
a bokongu tree and waited until at last the
gray of dawn came up from the east

  he started again watching for the
signs he had taught helene to always
leave as guidance an hour passed and
there was none he wondered if she had
taken the tree route with the boy riding
her shoulders the girl had developed
superb strength under the tutelage of ki-

gor and she loved when left alone to at-
tempt to equal the feats gf her jungle
mate himself

  he rounded a bend in the little used
footpath and spied a sign of the kind he
had been looking for

  a bit of nogi vine had been broken off
woven in a circle and left hanging on a
twig level with ki-kors eyes

  he seized it examined it it was wilted
from yesterdays sun so she had hung it
there shortly after leaving marmo there
were eight twists used in making the cir-
cle indicating that he intended to travel
eight arrow shots following a circular
course toward ramfis

  ki-gor tossed the message twig aside
and hurried forward traveling the foot-
path in long strides ngeeso tried vainly
to keep up but ended by riding on one
foot in a bend which marmo made in his
trunk after a distance of two arrow
shots ki-gor found another twig similar
to the first he was standing examining
it when he glimpsed someone down the
footpath it was brend

  the boy was exhausted he was torn
by thorns the soles of his feet left bloody
marks in hard-baked earth of the path
he saw ki-gor and ran the last few steps
of the distance he fell to hands and
knees weeping from exhaustion and
thankfulness

  ki-gor lifted him in his arms boy
tell me about it boy

  they have captured her ki-gor he
wept i could do nothing to save her
ki-gor she told me to escape i wan-
dered all night through the jungle without

knowing where-

  who captured her brend talk to

me who-

  the men of durga-rama they cap-
tured her last night at dusk when we
tried to approach the wall searching for
you it was my fault ki-gor i thought
we would be safe but there were so many

guards-

  they were looking for me brend but
tell me about helene

  she was carried off and i could do
nothing to stop them i escaped on my
hands and knees into the jungle am i
a coward ki-gor that i did not-
	jungle

  no brend you are not a coward
you could not fight them all you did
right in coming to me

  but helene will die

  she will not die brend ki-gor put
the boy down and went on speaking half
to himself she is worth more to durga-
rama alive and therefore she will live
perhaps the tyrant will use her to force
me back to his city or perhaps he may
want to make a trade-helene for you
brend

  ki-gor i will give myself up if i
do that then durga-rama will free her
no brend there would be nothing
gained by you giving yourself up we
have only one course open to us we will
ride marmo through their wretched gates
and rescue her

vii

the morning before helene
had ridden marmo along the valley
trail as far as she dared brend was
along and he cautioned her that it was
durga-ramas habit to keep lookouts
posted on the main jungle trails as it
would be difficult for any watchman to
overlook the spectacle of two persons rid-
ing an elephant helene left marmo in
a little-used side path and went on
toward ramfis with brend traveling afoot

  brend said it would be best to circle
through the deep bush and approach the
city from its river side where a grove
of towering trees grew down near the
stockade

  it was a long journey longer than she
had anticipated and darkness was settling
when they came in sight of the city

  from a distance they could hear the
noise of shouting men baying dogs and
the thunder of elephant-hide drums
helene looked questioningly at brend

  those are the alarms he said it
must be they are searching for some-
one otherwise the hounds would not be
loose

  perhaps ki-gor

  perhaps

  helene forgot some of her caution
she started along the path her lythe tan-
ned body moving with sinuous swiftness

stories

suddenly she stopped she could sense
danger ahead there in that patch of
wild coffee was a movement a tremble
of glossy leaves

  she seized brends shoulder and started
back a crackle of twigs in that direc-
tion made her draw up a second time

  she looked but she could see nothing
only the dim surrounding jungle yet
she was certain that many eyes were
watching her

  jshe backed slowly her small assagai
leveled before her a whisk of air
sounded directly above she leaped aside
expecting the deadly arrow of a blow-gun
instead a wide loop of grass rope
settled over her naked shoulders and
snaked tight locking her arms against her
body

  she struggled trying to bring her as-
sagai into play it was useless

  brend she screamed run brend
they must not capture you you must
return to marmo tell marmo what has
happened he will find ki-gor

  a second rope descended and a third
she was helpless brend had vanished
she could hear the crackle of underbrush
as he scrambled along black men had
appeared from every side their leader
bellowing in a coarse voice telling them
to capture the boy they were after him
smashing through the tangle stabbing
with their long assagais firing poisoned
arrows at him by sound

  in a few minutes they gave up and
gathered around helene jabbering to one
another staring at the strange sight of a
captive white woman

  their leader a thick-chested man
named mokotto issued a gutteral com-
mand an assagai was pointed at helenes
spine and she was made to walk across a
stretch of cassava and millet to the gate
of the city

  they paused with her at the door of a
large wood and bamboo house

  wait mokotto said to her speaking
a variety of bantu i will tell durga-
rama

  he climbed the stairs and saw durga-
rama sitting cross-legged on a heap of
thatch drinking palm wine at sound of
the footsteps durga-rama locked up and
the lost beasts of tatamba		

scowled his face seeming very large and
greasy by the light of the smoky fat-lamp
that burned near his knees when the
black man paused to bow he scowled the
more- he cast away the dregs of wine
and barked

  speak fool

  great durga-rama cried the black
dramatically i have captured a woman
what woman

  i do not know

  if she is some black wench then-

  she is not lord she is white
  white

  like ki-gor who fought the apes in
the arena this afternoon this woman is
white and she is beautiful

  the scowl faded from durga-ramas
thick face he poured more wine from
an earthen vessel lifted his cup and
smiled showing his brown-stained teeth

  so you have captured a woman of the
whiteness of ki-gor i have heard
it told that the white lord had a mate
and this must be the one that is good
come my strong mokotto and let me re-
ward you

  mokotto hesitated looking at the cop-
per bracelet durga-rami was going to give
him evidently he had not said everything
that was on his mind

  have you gone deaf i said to come
for your reward

  i am not deaf my lord there is
something more please do not be angry

with me-

  out with it durga-rama thundered
there wasi another the brown boy-
brend

  he was with ki-gors mate

  yes but he escaped it was not my

fault lord--

  durga-rama quieted him with an ab-
rupt gesture he looked dark and cursed
under his breath

  perhaps it is well he muttered at
last and the guardsman took a deep
breath durga-rama would rather have
brend escape than be brought aliv into the
city there had been mutterings against
him since the disaster of the afternoon
even over the rumble of elephant drums
he could hear the funeral chants as the
blacks wailed the deaths of relatives who

had been crushed in the arena and now
this meddler - liike - was organizing
something against him so it would be
worse if the boy were there a figurehead
to rally around

  he tossed the copper bracelet and said
you have acted wisely

  and the woman my lord you will
see the woman

 yes the woman a grim smile
played with the corners of durga-ramas
hard mouth bring her before me i
would see if she is like the white man

durga-rama was happy over this
new turn of events a few minutes
before he had grimly contemplated the
thought of ki-gor returning with the
lawful king and now like a gift form
isis this woman had fallen into his hands
with her he could do much she would be
worth more than a hundred assagais
against the jungle man perhaps he could
even force this ki-gor to take brend into
the forest and brain him he chuckled
contemplating such a thing indeed that
would be the supreme jest

  he bent forward his face close above
the grease lamp watching as the woman
was thrust through the door he could
not see her for a moment because of the
guards then they stepped aside and he
fastened his piglike eyes on her body

  durga-rama had looked on many wo-
men but he could not restrain a little ex-
halation of pleasure at the loveliness that
was here revealed before him indeed she
was beautiful she was tall her skin a
light tan like ki-gors she was clean-
limbed slim-waisted supple durga-rama
put down his cup and heaved his great bulk
erect he walked toward her with a heavy
shuffle viewed her from several angles
inspecting her body with the critical eye
of a slave merchant he laid his hand on
her shoulder and smiled when she shrank
from his touch

  you are ki-gors mate he asked
speaking the tongue of the congo which
he knew the white lord himself under-
stood

  she did not answer and he went on as
though speaking to himself

  you you would be a worthy mate for ki
	jungle

gor tall and strong and beautiful many
men would be glad to have such a woman
as you i know of markets where you
would bring a price of two hundred goats
-and i certainly could use two hundred
goats he chuckled at that showing his
brown teeth

  he walked close running appraising
hands down her arms examining the slim-
ness of her naked waist then he went back
to his couch and sat crosslegged fingering
his straggle of whiskers

  leave me he said to the blacks
wait outside the door when they were
gone he spoke on to helene ki-gor is
strong but strong men sometimes become
weaklings-for a woman

  what do you mean  helene cried
unexpectedly

  durga-rama tossed back his head
with a brutal peal of laughter

  ha so you do understand my words
it is as i thought he lifted the wine cup
to his lips and drank without taking his
eyes off her form yes strong men are
turned into sheep by women and so will
it be with ki-gor

  you have him in your prison 

  then you do not know durga-rama
made a wry face at the memory of what
took place that afternon for the moment
ki-gor has escaped us but you will bring
him back

  i do not know where he is

  but you know where he will go

  she met his gaze defiantly

  yes you know and here is what i
would have you do i would have you send
him a message by one of my men tell
him that you can go free and unharmed
-provided he sends me a package
package

  yes a package durga-rama gulped
more wine and in the package i must
find the head of brend

  youre insane

  no i am not insane i am a king and
i plan to remain a king he laughed at
her come do not put horror on your
face ki-gor has killed many things for
you-then why should he not kill once
again why not this worthless child
durga-rama clapped his hands and the
guards returned

stories	

  nungo you will carry  message for
me

  the man called nungo bowed

  you are to go to ki-gor- the

amazed expression which crossed nungos
face made the usurper pause yes you
fool to ki-gor why do you put on that
look of a she goat

  he will kill me lord

  in sudden rage durga-rama leaped to
his feet is it better to die here he
shrieked

  nungo saw the scimitar swing at the last
moment he tried to retreat and bring his
lance into action but the weapon was too
long its end rammed the wall and the
keen edge of the scimitar struck nungo
went down with a rattle of death in his
throat

  panthra who lay in shadow behind his
master came snarling forward lured by
the scent of warm blood but durga-rama
seized his leash and held him back

  mokotto take this cowards body and
throw it to the hounds

  durga-rama returned to his seat drink-
ing wine until mokotto came back

  who will now volunteer to carry the
message to ki-gor

  send me master pleaded mokotto
i would have offered myself first had you
given me the chance

  i may need you for another task burra
you will carry it he turned to helene
tell him where ki-gor is to be found

  i do not know

  i have ways of helping you to remem-
ber ways that are quick and ways that
are slow

  it will do no good to torture me i do
not know where ki-gor is we were
searching for him when your men captured
me

  what should i do with you woman
he asked

  free me

durga-rama roared with laughter
when i have no further use for you
-then perhaps i will free you he spoke
to his guardsmen take her to the little
room and watch that she does not escape
perhaps she has learned some of ki-gors
tricks
the lost beasts of tatamba	

  she will not escape master said
mokotto

  mokotto i would have a word with you
-alone

  durga-rama waited until they were all
gone except the ugly mokotto

  you have always been faithful to me
mokotto he said

  always my lord

  i have given you rich rewards mokot-
to when lungo would not sell his maiden
daughter to you last rainy season it was i
durga-rama who gave her to you and the
cost was nothing

  i am grateful my lord i am the low-
est creature of the forest and you are a

god riding on-

  enough of that we are much alike
mokotto we are both merciless both ready
to use our knives on the side that is best
for us good i like you for that and not
for your double-ended tongue that is why
i am going to give you even richer rewards
than ever before a brown woman for
your wife-you would like that mokotto 
the black mans eyes gleamed rapturous-

ly-

  one of the temple virgins

  perhaps were it not for that blind
priest liike he would never give a virgin
from the temple of isis to a black man
so you see he is a thorn in my flesh as well
as yours mokotto

  what would you have me do

  i would have you dip your knife in
liikes blood tonight it should not be
difficult you are chief among the guards
and you will be admitted anywhere
liike will be dead before that shaft
of moonlight moves the length of your foot
along the floor

  durga-rama watched as the thick-chest-
ed man felt the edge of his machete and
stalked from the door when he was gone
the usurper grunted and spat a brown
maiden for his bed a temple virgin
even durga-rama would not dare give such
a woman to a black mokotto was a fool-
but he was an excellent assassin most
assassins are fools for wise men hire oth-
ers to do their butchering for them

  he poured wine and sent for his spy a
sneaking parrot-faced brown man named
lotob

  what word have you asked durga-
rama

no more than i have already given you

  have you been asked to join the con-
spiracy against me

  no

  nor will you be they do not trust
you lotob they suspect you are my
friend but keep your ears open anyway
find out the names of those who are meet-
ing with liike i would know the one i am
to execute when the uprising is killed

viii

lotob left and durga-rama sat
on his thatch couch deep in thought
panthra was at ease watching with un-
blinking eyes now that he was alone
durga-rama stroked the lions thick mane
and talked to him

  you are my friend panthra my only
friend we are alike you alone i can
trust

  panthra fixed him with savage intent-
ness there was no expression in his eyes
-no affection only a crystallized hate for
all the race of men

  the lamp flame wavered and became
small as its font of grease was consumed
at last it blinked out leaving only reddish
coal and a wisp of acrid smoke durga-
rama did not call the slave to replenish
it he sat in the dark watching the shaft
of moonlight creep across the floor until it
had gone the length of a mans foot it
was time for mokotto to return with word
that liike was dead

  he did not come the moonlight crept
on no sound in the large house save for
the bare feet of guardsmen patrolling the
hall he cursed mokotto could expect
no mercy if he came creeping back with an
excuse durga-rama had one way of deal-
ing with failure the man would die on the
blade of the scimitar just as nungo had
died an hour or two before

  the sound of a heavy thud followed by
rapidly retreating footsteps drew him to
the tiny barred window he looked out
but the shadow of the wall was very dense
guardsmen were gathered out there jab-
bering excitedly they carried something
around the courtyard inside and up the
	jungle

stairs panthra sniffed and roared to his
feet

  durga-rama pulled him back as they
rapped at his door

  what is it

  it is mokotto he is dead

  durga-rama flung the door open a re-
flected light from the lower room shone on
mokottos distorted face he had died not
swiftly but on one of the breaking wheels
of the torture chamber the conspirators
had captured mokotto and tortured the
truth from him

  where did you find this carrion he
snarled at his men

  he was thrown over the wall and the
men who did it ran before we could tell
who they were

  another spoke they were of the kings
race by that he meant they were brown
men

  durga-rma sent them away he strode
the room hand closed on the hilt of his
scimitar

  the sands were running out for him
he knew that his friends were few his
enemies many the enemies had sent him
back mokottos corpse as a warning that
indicated that they considered themselves
strong enough to act but durga-rama
was not yet beaten he had a few friends
-those who were growing fat from his
kingship and he had another lot in the
game of fate-the power of his black
guard thirty of the strongest warriors of
ramfis

  he sent for them the thirty and they
arrayed themselves across the room oiled
bodies gleaming in the semi-darkness he
strode the length of the line and grunted
his satisfaction he issued an-order to a
slave who brought a casket of copper orna-
ments he distributed leg and arm brace-
lets rings for fingers ears and noses

  you are my men he said abruptly
when the casket was empty i have
made your bodies beautiful with copper
i have given you the pick of native maidens
for your wives as long as i am king
these things and more shall be yours if
another should kill me and be king your
wives and riches will be taken away and
you will be spit on like slaves

  the men shifted uneasily knowing that

stories

durga-rama was speaking the truth he
went on

  tonight or tomorrow i will need your
lances-to kill some swine he laughed
at this crude joke hefting his heavy scimi-
tar some swine who walk on two legs
and call themselves the race of kings you
will wait below see to it that no
man brown or black enters my courtyard

 these guardsmen gave durga-rama
temporary security for tonight at least
he would be safe enough and by tomor-
row he would find help elsewhere he knew
now that he would not use the white wo-
man to bargain with ki-gor he would
use her in a trade with chong chief of the
cannibal tatamba tribe from across the
river

  chong had two hundred warriors they
were not trained like his own guardsmen
but they were warriors nevertheless a
hundred of them added to his own guard
could smash any insurrection that liike
could launch against him and the loan of
a hundred warriors would not be a high
price for chong to pay for so desirable
a woman

  durga-rama called nunabba the guard
he had placed in charge of helene

  bring the woman to the river gate
i will meet you there

  he made ready for the journey drop-
ping a tiny poisoned dagger inside his
kuftan wrapping an indigo cloak high
above body and face he passed through
the river gate and found nunabba and
helene waiting for him

  where are you taking me helene
demanded wrenching at the ropes which
fastened her wrists

  durga-rama walked close smiling
breathing repulsively into her face

  i am taking you to meet your future
mate

 my mate is ki-gor he will-

  but i have looked and looked without
seeing him what good is a mate who
skulks like a jackal fifty arrow shots
away 

  helene was led along a footpath through
the darkness of the jungle in a short time
the deep sound of the river became audible
and they caught sight of moonlight shining
from its wide flat surface across could be
the lost beasts of tatamba	

seen the dark shores of the tatamba
domain

  they waded through reeds and stagnant
water until durga-rama found two con-
cealed dugout canoes he ordered helene
and nunabba into one of them leaving
instructions that they should await his re-
turn and set out alone driving his paddle
in mighty sweeps riding the crocodile-in-
fested waters toward the far shore

  he drew up in an overhung cove where
an elephant trail came down to the water
it was still sometime before dawn so he
chewed bethel nuts and waited with day-
light gleaming from the water behind him
he left the canoe and walked up the trail
the jungle was dense for a while with
hundreds of monkeys watching from the
tangled branches above then it broke away
and he entered a wide area of clearing

  here a few cassava and yam fields had
been scratched away from the encoaching
orchilla and elephant weeds by crude im-
plements of forked wood there was a
stretch of cane grass higher than his head
and emerging from that he caught sight of
the cluttering huts of a village with roofs
of thick thatch looking like toadstools

  durga-rama had visited the village only
once and that years ago while on an ex-
pedition to punish the cannibal tatambas
after they had stolen two women from the
ramfian yam fields on that occasion of
course the village had been burnedbut this
one built on its ruins was from all ap-
pearances the same

  he walked rapidly along the path
smoke haze rose slowly through the humid
morning air from the fires where women
were baking millet cakes on hot stones
there were no lookouts he was first no-
ticed by a crowd of naked children who ran
beside him coming close to feel the fabric
of his indigo robe durga-rama did not
glance to right nor left he seemed oblivi-
ous to their presence when one of them
a boy of six or seven tripped and fell in
front of him durga-rama merely trod
over him and left him wailing on the
ground

  he entered the duty path which wound
like a crawling snake between two rows
of thatch huts passed a mud-roofed house

-jungle-winter

from which rolled an odor of putrefied
gri-gris and came to what was evidently
the chiefs house-one somewhat removed
from the others sitting on a slight rise of
ground

  he was stopped at the door by a guards-
man who confronted him with a leveled
assagai

  i would see chong

  the guard retreated he was a coward
despite the ferocious appearance of his
face which was twisted around a skewer
of ivory thrust through his nose

  wait i tell chong he said in his
gutteral language

  he lifted the drape of skin covering the
low doorway and bent double to go in-
side he was gone the time it takes a man
to breath fifty times then he emerged and
spoke

  chong wait inside

  lift the drape for me snarled durga
rama his hand closing on his scimitar

  with a surly motion the man obeyed
durga-rama entered and stood for a mo-
ment the hut was dark after the bright
morning sunlight uncured skins of zebras
giraffes and jungle cats covered the dirt
giving off an odor of dry decay four squat
women of the tribe were crouched in the
deeper shadow along the wall while a tall
bandy-legged poltuni wench occupied a
favored position on a skin-covered heap of
thatch in the center of the hut sat chong
himself

  chonk was large and round-shouldered
he had once been muscular but some of
the muscle had now dissolved into fat from
the easy life he led his face was broad
and flat his skin oily his head shaved and
gleaming like polished ebony

  durga-rama he said not offering to
rise

  you are honored by my visit growled
the usurper

  chong waited all his life he had hated
these men of ramfis and that hatred show-
ed in his face now but he feared too and
he was curious about this unprecedented
visit durga-rama went on

  i come to tell you of a woman chong
a beautiful woman with a contemptuous
twist of his lips he looked around at
chongs wives this woman she is not
jungle stories



ia short bow-legged wench like those with
which you have contented yourself this
woman is tall and white like a vision of
the gods her hair is like copper her
waist is so slim your two hands would
pass around it and yet her hips and
breasts are full as the rising moon such
a woman would be worth the whole of your
wretched kingdom chong

  chongs eyes gleamed with interest in
the midst of his flat face he was a fancier
of women he had always dreamed to have
for himself such a one as durga-rama
described-perhaps a maiden of the race of
ramfis

  where is this woman

  she is near

  in the village

  sit down and hear me out hear how
you may have her for yourself to keep in
your hut until you are tired of her
what is this womans name 

  the name is no difference you may
name her as you please

  chongs eyes shifted nervously the ex-
pression of longing left his face and a
twist of animal fear replaced it he won-
dered why durga-rama would part with
such a woman and now he guessed

  i have heard that the white lord
called ki-gor is roaming the jungles of
ramfis ki-gor has such a mate as you tell
about

  what care you if she is ki-gors
mate 

  ho chong beat the dirt with his
knuckles i have heard of this ki-gor
he would come to my village and hurl
lightning bolts with his strong-bow which is
said to be thick as a mans leg and long as

the neck of a giraffe he would-

  you coward fool durga-rama spat
among the dusty rotting skins on the floor
your liver is yellow and you have a wo-
mans breast where your lions heart
should be listen while i tell you the
truth of this ki-gor we ourselves cap-
tured him for us he performed in a cage
like a captive baboon we spat on him
and he cringed from terror then we
freed him and he ran skulking into the
jungle i myself saw this mighty bow you
tell about these arms of mine drew it
back and shot an arrow you have been

listening to the tales told by the ivory
hunters and they have always been the
worst liars in the universe

  it did not occur to chong that durga-
rama himself might be lying chong was
a simple-minded man only a little removed
from the apes and up to this time each
promise and each threat of the men of
ramfis had been carried out

  durga-rama said of course if you
do not want this glorious creature for your
couch  

  what is her price

  a miserable price or else you could
not pay it i only ask the loan of one
hundred warriors for the space of two
suns

  what would the great king of ramfis
need with one hundred warriors 

  what do you care of my need as long as
the woman is yours

  chong became crafty it is true that
the men of ramfis have taken to wetting
spears in each others blood 

  make up your mind about the woman
before i take her for myself

  our yam fields are low and sour but
the fields on high land across the river
grow fine crops the ancient men of my
tribe tell me it has ever been thus yet the
people of your tribe are rich and do not
need all their fields the hundred warriors
i will lend you and i will not complain if
half of them die in your battle but you
must give me those fields closest the river
and you must also give me the woman
durga-rama finally agreed as chong
wanted it he would send helene when the
hundred warriors were delivered to his
command after the issue at ramfis was
settled the warriors were not to return
across the river but would be allowed to
build huts on the area of fertile grassland
along the rivers western bank

  durga-rama laughed to himself as he
retraced his steps across the low-lying do-
mains of the tatambas this chong he
detested when the insurrection was put
down in ramfis he would reorganize his
guard and slaughter the warriors who had
built huts afterwards he would cross the
river in force and retake helene for him-
self a white-skinned woman such as
helene would be worth many pounds of
the lost beasts of tatamba	

copper in bartar with the arab slave
merchants in the north

  helene was with nunabba still bound
still sitting in the canoe he smiled and
said to her

  i have good news you are to be a
queen-a queen of a cannibal village you
will belong to chong in trade for one
hundred warriors it is not every woman
who is valued at so high a price

  helene gave no sign of having heard
durga-ramas words she sat very
straight looking across the vast stretch of
river

at the moment she was helpless
her hands tied securely by the grass
rope there was no point in struggling or
pleading but she would not always be so
helpless inside the breast of her leopard-
skin bodice was tucked a tiny dagger
the dagger blade was scarcely longer than
her middle finger and it folded cleverly
inside a golden case shaped like a scarab
long ago ki-gor had found it in the val-
ley of tombs and given it to her today
when she was handed over as wife to
chong the scarab dagger would serve its
deadly purpose

  they waited as the morning sun became
hot at length five dugout canoes so load-
ed with warriors their sides dipped water
came in sight and crossed the broad
stream avoiding mudbars where swams of
crocodiles lay with backs exposed like
stranded driftlogs

  the warriors came ashore naked save
for shields breechclouts and decorations
of feather copper and cowrie shells they
were armed with assagais crude bows and
black-headed poisoned arrows durga- ra-
ma bellowed a command and they lined up
for his inspection

when he was through the guard who
had been at chongs hut came up and said
chong told me to bring the woman
durga-rama nodded a trifle regretfully
yes the woman nunabba bring the
white goddess who is the wife of chong
the warrior stared at her white beauty
as she walked towards them through water
up to her thighs they did not take their
eyes away until the canoe carrying her was
a small streak far across the water

  come barked durga-rama let us
get to the fighting and afterward i will
show you the fields where you will grow
rich and fat

  helene felt slightly sick when she was
thrust through the low doorway to chongs
hut hot putrefying odors struck her
she stood near the wall her eyes peering
through gloom she made out a squat
heavy shouldered man sitting crosslegged
on a zebra skin his forehead was low
his intelligence obviously little above the
apes he was staring at her jaw relaxed

  after a while he sucked his breath he
came forward

  you are beautiful he said more
beautiful than  

  she recoiled from his touch

  do not fear me he breathed i will
not beat you like my other wives i will
not scar your smooth skin you will grow

used to me i am-

  you are a fool she said trying to
make her voice coldly contemptuous

he stopped i a fool i am chong-
yes you are a fool did he not tell
you i was ki-gors mate do you not
know that ki-gor will carry death to any
man who touches me

  but ki-gor is gone fled from the
wrath of durga-rama

  ki-gor left the people of ramfis in
terror with dead men being wailed in every
hut and soon he will return to find me
and the man who harms me will die like a
pig with a jevelin through his heart you
are a fool chong or you would free me
and save yourself

  chongs dull eyes became shifty he
rubbed his large shiny hands together
considering the wrath of ki-gor

  no he finally said i have traded
a hundred warriors for you is the price
not big enough to make you mine

  he will kill you with bolts of lightning
with his strongbow

  agh chong made a wretching move-
ment and spat he will do nothing this
is but womans talk to frighten me did
not durga-rama himself say he had shot
ki-gors bow are not his arrows but
twigs of the assagai tree i am chong
and i do not fear him let him come seek-
ing you on the elephant men say he rides
	jungle

i	will make a pitfall and line it with pointed
stakes and i will capture them both

  you are a fool chong ki-gor will

leap your pitfall-

  no not even ki-gor the pitfall
stands in the passage between two swamps
men may cross but an elephant will break
through they will not escape

  chong grinned around at his ugly wives
who were crouched outside peering
through the door

  is not my new wife beautiful he
chuckled rubbing his hands

ix

after his meeting with brend
and hearing from his lips the story of
helenes capture ki-gor left the brown
boy and ngeeso riding on the elephants
broad back climbed to the high treetops
overhead and swung swiftly from one to
the other by means of their ropelike vines
in this manner it took only a few minutes
to catch sight of the city

  there were no beating of pursuit drums
no crowds gathered in holiday spirit with
bodies bedaubed in paint ki-gor stood on
a small branch close to the swaying top of
a lofty tree and for the space of a hun-
dred breaths his eyes studied the city of
ramfis

  through the rising heat waves which
distorted the picture he could see a cluster
of black men near the temple of isis he
could tell they were warriors by the re-
peated glints of sunshine on the bronze
tips of their assagais by durga-ramas
house another group of men were de-
ployed there seemed to be no fighting go-
ing on but he could tell that some sort of
trouble was brewing

  he gave a grunt of satisfaction though
his fine brows were still drawn together as
he puzzled his course he did not know
whether to go openly or by stealth to
charge in on the back of marmo might
lead abrupt action by durga-rama he
might in his rage plunge a dagger into the
heart of helene on the other hand delay
did not suit ki-gors impetuous spirit

  he reached for a vine wrapped one leg
and slid toward earth he stopped swing-
ing through air like a pendulum while his

stories

eyes noted something else a file of war-
riors wound its way toward him along the
footpath he listened as their voices came
closer they were talking to one another in
the guttural language of the tatamba
tribe from across the river

  ki-gor first thought they were seizing a
moment of civil war to make an attack on
the city but when the column came closer
he saw that their leader was not of the de-
generate cannibal tribe the leader was
durga-rama himslf regal in a robe of in-
digo scimitar flashing at his waist

  ki-gor slid down the vine and dropped
with cats-paw lightness to a thick branch
overhanging the footpath

  they passed directly beneath him so
close he could have touched the points of
their assagais

  one of the warriors had fallen a trifle
behind the rest he limped and finally
stuck his assagai point down in earth and
bent over to remove a briar from between
his toes ki-gor did not move the warrior
stood and hurried forward to catch his
fellows he did not glance above he
walked beneath the limb and ki-gor swung
down hanging by bent knees his hands
darted and they closed on the cannibals
throat

  he lifted the fellow from the ground
and held him feet lashing with the des-
perate impotence of a man on the gibbet
ocassionaly ki-gors fingers relaxed so
the warrior could suck air into his tortured
lungs at length the sounds of the column
died away ki-gor released his grip al-
lowing the man to fall in a crumpled heap
on the ground he lighted beside him and
waited for consciousness to return

  the warrior finally sat up and blinked
terrified eyes at the strange white man

  do not kill me he gasped do not
kill me only poor warrior me-

  i will not kill you if you answer my
questions

  i am the lowest of the low he chanted
in one of the fetish tongues making signs
over the gri-gri pouch at his waist

  ki-gor made an impatient movement
where were you being jed by durga-
rama 

  i do not know chong our chief he
say we fight he say we kill who durga-

i
the lost beasts of tatamba



  rama say he say we get rich land on
  river-

    have you seen a woman with skin like
  mine a woman whose beauty is like the
  sun 

    the warrior drew in his breath with a
  sucking sound rolling his eyes back in their
  sockets after this dumb-show he pointed
  to the river with his elongated lower lip

    at dawn master i see the white god-
  dess her skin like masters skin her

    where is she now

    perhaps they have taken her to chongs
  village

    the sudden rage of the white man which
  followed these words made him lower him-
  self belly down in the footpath

    it was not my will master i was-

    ki-gor seized him by the scruff of the
  neck lifted him to his feet

    you will lead me to this chong

    yes master

     ki-gor started back keeping his captive
  running ahead of him until at length he
  caught sight of marmo

    marmo came to a halt and at ki-gors
  command held his trunk for the cannibal
  black to mount but the fellow fell on his
  knees in fear of the great brute and no
  urging from ki-gor could make him walk
  a step closer finally ki-gor said a few
  words in swahili and marmo wrapped his
  trunk around the mans trembling body
  and lifted him to his back

    guided by tatamba they soon reached
  the swampy edge of the river it was a
   wide and turgid stream brown with a
  cargo of sediment gathered from the black
  heart of africa here and there were
  mudbanks with bushes clinging to them
  and dotting their edges were the slimy
  bodies of crocodiles

    forward said ki-gor barely hesitat-
  ing at the brink you have crossed such
  rivers before o marmo

 the beast trumpeted softly
 in answer to these words from his be-
 loved master in a moment he was belly-
 deep in ooze among the rushes of the shore
 he struggled on slowly like some huge
 ant caught in a sea of heavy syrup at
 last the slow current of the stream rippled

along his broad sides his back sank almost
from sight and he swam

  ki-gor slid from his head and struck
out in the lead his knife in his teeth as
protection against devilfish and crocodiles
watching for whirlpools and shallow
stretches where quicksand might trap the
great brute he passed close to mudbanks
with the eyes of crocodiles fastened on him
like god-forgotten eyes of prehistoric mon-
sters

  at midstream one of the reptiles larger
than the rest slid from a bar and swam
towards him with a swft sinuous move-
ment

  ki-gor speeded he did not wish to be
delayed by a fight the crocodile drove
for him snapping at his feet a quick roll
by ki-gor made the attempt miss him he
kept the knife in his teeth and trod water
for a few seconds while removing one of
the heavy arrows from his quiver and
breaking it in half

  he waited missing no move of the croc-
odile remaining suspended in order to
tempt its speedy return the crocodile
rolled over disappearing only a riffle of
distortion on the surface of the water
served to mark his progress swifter it
came and swifter suddenly the long head
broke water eyes on ki-gor mouth open
showing the jagged fangs the mouth
was ready to close and cut ki-gor in two
like a mighty scissors

  marmo saw and trumpeted shrilly there
were mixed screams from brend and
ngeeso ki-gor did not move to place
himself out of reach instead at the final
moment he twisted forward through the
water and as the jaws snapped shut he
thrust the broken half of the arrow wedg-
ing it to prop open the reptiles mouth

  with a quick sweep of his arms ki-gor
was away avoiding by inches the lash of
the crocodiles tail

  the huge amphibian turned over and
over beating the water to a brownish froth
shaking his head trying vainly to free his
jaws from the torture of the arrow but
it was propped there as solidly as ki-gors
strength could thrust it and the harder he
fought the deeper sank its keen point in
the roof of his mouth around him the
froth turned pinkish from blood and sud-
	 jungle

denly the reptile rolled over with muscles
trembling the arrow point had worked
through and found his brain

  downstream other crocodiles were show-
ing an interest tasting blood in the water
they slid from their resting places and
came in dozens but ki-gor had reached
deep water and was swimming with pow-
erful strokes toward the shore

  he waded through shoulder-high rushes
and found an elephant trail showing the
marks of new travel

  is this the way he asked the tam-
tamba

  it is the way master

  the trail led through low-lying jungle
where the air was heavy with odors of fun-
gus miasma and the damp-rot that clings
like leprosy orchids grew in fiery splen-
dor suspended from trees their roots ab-
sorbing moisture from the steamy atmos-
phere but animal life seemed to be lack-
ing it was not a good country this do-
main of the cannibal blacks

  in time the trail led to the edge of a
swamp where trees stood with half their
root systems above water reaching down
like clutching hands there was a second
swamp at the left this one cut in until
the footpath followed a shoulder of land
only forty or fifty paces in width

  marmo suddenly drew up lifting his
trunk in a manner which showed there was
something close that did not meet his ap-
proval ki-gor saw him but his hurry
was too urgent to pause he ran ahead
senses drawn to a fine point while the ele-
phant lumbered in a half-gallop behind

  ki-gors eyes were keen along the
ground to pick up a warning spoor and
they roved the solid jungle walls for the
tiny leaf movements that would be his
warnings of ambush

  the warning came perhaps there was
no real movement perhaps it was only an
instinct passed down from the primitive
that lays dormant in all civilized men but
had been reborn in ki-gor through his
years in contact with nature

  he leaped to one side up there the
glossy leaves trembled whether it was
a man or lurking leopard he did not know

  marmo came on slowly breaking his
speed ngeeso was leaping back and forth

stories

on his head jabbing him with his short
assagai

  stop him ki-gor he shrilled in his
pigmy tongue stop this foolish moun-
tain they have set a pitfall for him

  ki-gor could not see the pitfall from
his position on the ground but it was plain
to ngeeso above a pit had been tunneled
beneath the footpath leaving the original
beaten earth in a fragile bridge over the
top the bridge of earth was thick enough
to support several men but the elephant
would have plunged to his death on the
pointed hardwood stakes that most cer-
tainly were driven below

  marmo came to a stop at the final in-
stant setting his feet as the edge caved
away he trumpeted in a high scream
rearing back to his haunches the ground
still crumbled but the great animal rolled
to his side spilling his human cargo back
among the bramble of thorns fora second
he lay there on the brink then he rolled
taking small trees down as he went and
thus gained the assurance of solid earth

  ki-gor saw all this from the side of his
eye for at the same moment ngeeso shout-
ed warning of the pitfall an arrow whisked
by so close its bit of feathered tail brushed
the flesh of his arm

  for a fraction of time the ambusher was
barely visible through the leaf-tangle ki-
gors muscles responded like automatic
mechanism with stunning swiftness the
strong-bow came from his shoulder an
arrow was fitted drawn released the
bowstring twanged with a bass sound and
like an echo came the thump of metal ar-
rowhead as it struck through the bony
framework of a human chest a man ut-
tered a wild wavering scream and plunged
head foremost from his place atop a limb

another poisoned arrow

stabbed the earth nearby then a
dozen of them winging in a shower but
like the arrows of most native archers
they were woefully inaccurate ki-gor did
not try to answer any but the first he
swung up among the branches bounded
crouching along a limb as thick as a mans
body and in a matter of seconds was look-
ing down of his would-be killers

  so quick and silent had been the man-
the lost beasts of tatamba	

euver that most of them thought he had
simply vanished in air he balanced with
toes holding the smooth bark drew a half-
dozen arrows from his quiver and in rapid
succession he loosed them

  two of the tatamba fell before their
companions realized where the hail of
death was coming from they screamed
in terror at the great white man poised
above his hand loaded with winged de-
struction they dropped their weapons
and fell scrambling to the ground

  they were gone and ki-gor expected
no further trouble from them he turned
his attention to marmo shouted in swahili
and the elephant trumpted in answer ki-
gor gave the word which instructed him
to go right he obeyed crashing a way
through the undergrowth he followed the
soft edge of the swamp safe from the
deadfall and climbed once more to the
footpath beyond

  ki-gor swung rapidly from tree to tree
watching the country ahead the jungle
ended and he looked across a broad park
area dotted here and there by poor yam
fields beyond the fields were the round-
topped huts of the tatamba village

  he waited until marmo came near and
dropped to his head he crouched on
knees urging the huge beast to greater
speed guiding him with the point of an
arrow

  marmo had not taken time to lift brend
and ngeeso once more to his back ki-
gor could hear the voice of the pigmy
coming to him from the edge of the jungle

  wait for me ki-gor

  but ki-gor did not wait ngeeso and
brend would only be a hindrance the am-
bushers had already fled across the yam
fields and were in the village shouting the
alarm

  on reaching the one street of the village
ki-gor urged the elephant to a charge
warriors were running from huts having
seized their lances and their painted leather
shields they saw the thing that was
charging down on them drew up for a
moments consternation and fled for cover
like mice scurrying from a falcon one of
them rose from a pit beside the path poised
a javelin and hurled it

  the weapon flew true sinking its point

in marmos thick hide but whether or not
the beast even felt it was a question he
ran without flinching while the long shaft
whipped back and forth hanging by its
barbed point

  ki-gor stood balancing himself on mar-
mos pitching head he struck himself on
the chest and lifted his strongbow high
and his voice rose in a cry as it did that
night on the ridge when he killed the great
ape

  fifty arrows and javelins were ready to
be loosed and out of such a shower it
would be a miracle to ride unscathed but
his name seemed to take the fight momen-
tarily out of them and in these brief sec-
onds of respite the jungle man guided his
elephant up the footpath to the large hut
he correctly supposed was the hut of
chong

  he could have charged into the hut and
left it a heap of tangled rubble but he
feared for helene who might be inside

  he leaped to earth tore the skin drape
from the low doorway and strode inside

  helene screamed as she saw him he
could see her only vaguely as his eyes ac-
customed themselves to the gloom she
started for him-stopped a man rose be-
tween them a huge beast of a man with
bowed legs and the chest of a gorilla he
had tripped and fallen and his hand was
clutching his chest his fingers glistening
with blood

  the man was chong helene had struck
him with her tiny scarab dagger but he
was built on a more massive scale than
most men and the short blade had failed
to reach his heart

  chong looked at helene with dull eyes
then he spun to face ki-gor after a
stunned moment he realized who the god-
like white man was

  you he muttered through his heavy
lips you-ki-gor

  yes i am ki-gor

  do not kill me he whined i am
your friend i will tell you of your en-
em durga-rama listen while i tell-

  as he spoke chong backed slowly across
the hut he reached the wall paused
there hands feeling behind him ki-gor
stood waiting with only his knife in his
hand his bow was on his shoulder the
	jungle

arrows in the quiver for the moment it
appeared to the crafty chong that he was
quite helpless

  with a swift movement unexpected of
a man of his weight chong whipped an
assagai from the wall behind him swung
it high and drove it at ki-gors naked
chest

  but ki-gor was ready for this snake-
like move he pivoted to one side hitch-
ing his body from the way as the shaft
fanned past and disappeared through the
wall of the hut

  he pounced forward knife lifted high
chong could escape to neither side the
wall was at his back he seemed prepared
to meet the rush then he flung himself
backward striking the heaped robes with
his shoulders legs doubled

  ki-gor stopped as chongs legs uncoiled
but not in time to avoid their impact they
sank into his groin

  the blow was brutal and for a moment
the jungle man was staggered he recov-
ered his balance and once more advanced
chong was ready for him now he had
found a weapon a native machete with a
blade two feet long

  chong swung the heavy knife with both
hands gripping the handle as if it were an
axe but ki-gor was himself now he
shifted his body just enough to make the
deadly stroke miss in missing chong
staggered off balance

  ki-gor pounced his left arm was up
as though to guard the knife in his right
hand was ready chong managed to re-
gain his balance he rolled the knife in his
hands and swung it back ordinarily that
maneuver would have kept an assailant at a
distance but ki-gor moved with startling
rapidity

  he avoided the knifes murderous point
and sprang his left hand darting to seize
chongs wrist

  for the second chong was helpless as
though in the grip of a steel trap he
wrenched once and that was all the time
that was given him the knife swung up
and descended with speed faster than
sight

  chong was struck he rolled over his
toes and plunged face foremost raising
a cloud of dust from the floor

stories

he was dead as he fell pierced
through the heart ki-gor looked at
him without regret without pity he had
killed through necessity through the oper-
ation of the only law he understood-the
law of the wild he turned and helene
ran to his arms pressing her soft cheek
against his chest wetting his bronzed skin
with tears of thankfulness

  you are unharmed he asked

  yes ki-gor

  the scarab dagger was still open in her
hand she closed its slim blade and slip-
ped it inside her bodice

  you stabbed him helene

  yes

  but you did not kill him ki-gor
smiled i am glad i would not want
even the blood of a swine on your hands

  he held her for a moment then he put
her away and stepped from the door of the
hut he had been inside for the time it
takes to breathe sixty times and the tribes-
men had overcome their first amazed ter-
ror and were organizing themselves into a
sort of army in a few moments the air
would be filled with their deadly little ar-
rows so it would be wise to leave quickly

  marmo was waiting ki-gor issued a
command and the great beast bent his
knee for helene when she was safely
on his back ki-gor vaulted beside her

  the tatamba warriors saw him and
loosed their arrows at long range twenty
or thirty of them had taken positions
among the huts at the lower end of the vil-
lage waiting to fire their shafts as ki-
gor and helene rode by

  marmo set off at a heavy gallop for a
while it seemed that ki-gor would take
the beast directly through the deadly
gauntlet then he uttered a command and
marmo turned sharply to the left

  huts stood there in a solid line with
scarcely room between them for a man to
pass marmo did not hesitate he
charged directly at the nearest of them
he tossed his head and trunk high smash-
ing the flimsy structure ki-gor pulled
helene flat beside him so as not to be
swept off among falling debris there
was a crunch of rending bambo a roll of
dust from the moldy thatch and the hut
collapsed with terrified natives darting
the lost beasts of tatamba	

away like ants from an uprooted hill

  marmo went on plunging shoulder deep
in cane grass on the soft ground that sep-
arated yam fields and village he trod
deep ooze swung back in the direction of
the footpath

  at the edge of the village warriors were
idancing waving assagais in impotent rage
one of them followed on the run catch-
ing up as marmo was slowed by the heavy
ground he dropped to one knee and
drove a poisoned arrow from his bow
most of the tatamba were pitiful in
the use of bow and arrow but this one
through skill or accident fired straight
toward helenes back with a rapid move-
ment ki-gor thrust his elephant-hide
quiver in the arrows path and the leather
stopped its vicious little point

  ki-gor balanced himself set an arrow in
the string of his strong-bow and shot the
warrior through he fell threshing the
earth in death-agony and sight of him was
sufficient to discourage the rest in a few
moments more marmo had carried them
out of range brand and ngeeso were
waiting halfway across the fields ki-gor
paused for them and continued at an easy
pace toward the river

x

durga-rama marched his ta-
tamba warriors directly to the river
gate of ramfis no one seemed to note their
approach it was only a few strides from
jungle to gate and the gate was concealed
from the rest of the town by his house
and the collapsed arena

  there was no watchman on the gate
with the help of two brawny warriors he
broke it down

  once inside he could hear the sound
of shouting men a battle was in progress

  he ran past the stockade of his house
and drew up suddenly as an arrow drove
its head in a picket close beside him he
retreated in cover of the stockade then
climbed and thrust his head cautiously over
its top to survey the scene

  five of his black guardsmen and as
many of the enemy force lay dead in the
open space in front of the gate there
must have been a hand-to-hand struggle

after which the other guardsmen had taken
refuge behind the stockade where they
were standing off the attacking ramfians
with arrows

  he shouted a few words of instruction
down to his barricaded men and a cheer
came from their throats he had returned
they had been on the point of surrender-
ing with a plea for mercy but they had no
thought of surrender now to their minds
the leadership of durga-rama made them
invincible

  durga-rama retraced his steps he
paused hands on hips to look at his ta-
tamba warriors who were chattering ex-
citedly to one another barely restraining
the impulse to retreat he quieted their
tongues with a sweep of his arm beast
that he was he was a natural leader other-
wise he would never have secured a concert-
ed attack from such a draggle-tailed army

  forward he bellowed death to
those few wretched ones hiding by the
temple

  his manner showed only contempt for
the enemy by his confidence the ta-
tambas assumed they had before them only
the slaughter of a dozen or so with sud-
den enthusiasm they shouted their war
cries and rushed forward

  durga-rama waved them past as they
rushed into the open beyond the wall his
finely trained guardsmen emerged from
hiding whipping a sudden fury of arrows
to keep the revolting army under cover

  the tatambas swarmed along the path
the onslaught was unexpected liikes
men who had taken cover near the temple
saw them at the last moment rose to meet
them fighting was close assagai against
assagai one of the cannibals seeing it
was not a slaughter of helpless men as he
had anticipated broke and ran his action
coud have caused a stampede among his
fellows but durga-rama saw the danger
leaped forward with a long stride and cut
the man in half with one mighty swing of
his scimitar

  death to the man who retreats he bel-
lowed

  the tatamba feared him more than
they did the enemy in a moment the
struggle had so engulfed them that the
possibility of retreat no longer existed
	jungle

it was fight or die and they fought like
cornered rats for a while it was thus
with the battle see-sawing

  above the uproar durga-rama could be
heard ordering his guardsmen from the
courtyard they came running and formed
a close group three abreast as he had
trained them he waited the correct mo-
ment-the moment when the apex of the
battle was reached when a sudden on-
slaught would tip the balance one way or
the other

  the moment came his soldiers in-
stinct perceived it forward he cried

  his guardsmen came in a solid array
bristling with leveled assagais they cut
the battle in two segments then turned
and tore the heart from the ramfian army
when the enemy tried to retreat to the
temple of isis a group of archers who had
formed the middle men of the column
shot them down with a shower of arrows

  this completed the rout every man
tried to save himself liike the blind
priest was led from the door of his tem-
ple

  after him  death to the high-priest
roared durga-rama

  a couple of his guardsmen charged
around the temple but they were cut down
by javelins a little group of brown men
formed a knot around liike protecting
him until they reached the far wall per-
haps thirty of the revolting army reached
that wall and escaped they paused for a
while trying to reform a line and then re-
treated slowly toward the protecting cover
of the jungle

  durga-rama left an order for the
wounded enemy to be executed encamped
the tatamba forces in the native village
and posted his black guards along the walls
the city thus firmly in his control he
went to his quarters to refresh himself with
wine

  he rested through the hot hours of af-
ternoon with panthra at his side then he
arose annointed his massive body with ci-
vet perfume and donned a robe of silk for
which he had once traded two young fe-
male slaves to the arabs of the north

  he looked at himself in a mirror of pol-
ished silver and grunted satisfaction he
was handsome enough now to win the love

stories

of any woman for a moment he regretted
that it had been necessary to trade helene
to that swine of a cannibal chieftain but
a victim of arlennas young beauty came
to console him he smiled in contempla-
tion he had waited long for this day
he had watched arlenna grow to woman-
hood he had longed for her these many
years and now this very afternoon he
would take her for wife

  he struck a triangular bronze gong
four times and kadala a big-boned slave
woman entered and bowed

kadala go to the house of aknor and
tell them i would have you prepare their
daughter arlenna for the marriage feast
you would have me bring her here
asked the woman in a coarse voice

  my tepoi will meet her at the door of
her house she will be carried down the
street of the native village as is the custom
we will drink the marriage cup in the tem-
ple then you will bring her here

  yes my lord

  durga-rama issued more orders-or-
ders for feasts to be prepared orders for
casks of wine to be opened in the native
village this completed he paced the room
pausing frequently to look from the tiny
barred window at the house of aknor

arlenna had concealed herself in
terror while the battle was going on
finally her nurse an old slave woman
named raga came with word that the bat-
tle was over and that liikes forces had
fled

  i heard the voice of durga-rama-
was he among the fallen

  no he still rules the city

  alenna was not cruel but she prayed for
the death of durga-rama she detested
the man and feared him many times she
had dreamed of being made ready for mar-
riage to brend but marriage to durga-
rama seemed like a nightmare

 raga patted her hand but your
brother relknes escaped

  this news brought arlenna some assur-
ance she came from her room and passed
the time by plucking the silken strings of
a kobnoor

  there was a sound at the door and
raga went to answer it she ran back and
the lost beasts of tatamba	

looked at arlenna with what seemed like
terror in her eyes

raga what-

my child it is now-today

what are you talking about

kadala has come

the significance of her words gave the
girl a sinking feeling kadalas arrival
could mean only one thing the marriage
would be this very evening it would be
kadalas task to perfume her body and
make her ready for her master

no said arlenna backing across the

room tell her i am not here-

raga shook her head no child-

save me raga keep her out there
while i leave by the back way

raga hesitated she feared kadala
but she loved her young mistress

go then run

 kadala strode to the draped door of the
 room raga seized her and tried to keep
 her from entering

you must wait-

i do not wait i come from durga-
rama the king did i not hear the sound
of a kobnoor being played

kadal flung the old woman aside and
strode in she glimpsed the girl through-
the flimsy bamboo partition and rushed
after her kadala seized arlenna by the
wrist and led her in the girl wept and
tried vainly to free herself but kadalas
strength was like a mans

kadala was a slave but not a slave in
mind she was strong and domineering
as the leading slave of a tyrant is likely
to be she had fulani blood and hence
considered herself superior to these brown
men of ramfis and her bondage had
turned that feeling into hatred she espe-
cially hated this girl with her soft cheeks
and her eyes that seemed ready to dissolve
into tears

you will come she said bowing as a
slave must i am here to make you ready
for your marriage

 arlenna tried to say something but her
 throat was constricted and no words came
 kadala looked at her cotton robe

 you cannot go to the tepoi of your lord
 in such a garment as that

raga the ancient slave had fled ka-
dala shouted until another slave woman

appeared you tell me has this girl
no other robe than this thing of cotton
has she no robe of purple so she will be
made beautiful in the eyes of her new
lord

  she has a robe of blue-

  then bring it bring it before i have
the dogs of durga-rama turned loose on
you and when you return bring also
the oils of palm and some scent of musk

  arlenna stood with eyes closed as ka-
dala annointed her according to the ram-
fian custom her hair was brushed with
pulverized red mica until it sparkled with
a thousand facets then the blue robe was
draped over her shoulders fastened close
around her throat

  the task finished kadala strode to the
door to look for the tepoi it stood on
the ground with eight powerful blacks
waiting to carry it on their broad shoulders

  the tepoi was large and ornate it had
a canopy of purple silk curtains of white
gauze there were bangles and ornaments
of copper and cowrie shells its handles
were made of carved tusks

  arlenna hestitated at the draped en-
trance but kadala followed urging her
she lifted the curtain and crawled inside

  the interior was a couch strewn with
arabian pillows she sat for a while but
the ceiling was low so she reclined on one
arm things were visible through the
white gauze as through a fog she recog-
nized the brown men who had not fled
after the battle she saw the blacks drunk
on sweet wine resplendent in barbaric
finer

  the tepoi moved with a gently swaying
motion as the blacks carried it along it
paused and was lowered to the ground
she wondered why-then she saw durga-
rama coming with long strides sunlight
flashing on his bright silken robe

  he parted the curtains she was con-
scious of his strength of the massive bulk
of him she smelled the civet and oil
with which he had smeared his body and
it made her sick he came inside and the
drapery fell

outside people were cheering but
the sound seemed far off like a part
of a nightmare arlenna forgot time and
	jungle

place her only sensations were fear
coupled with loathing for the man who was
lying so close to her

  on one elbow he rested body relaxed
and moving easily with the swing of the
tepoi he looked at her for a while then
he reached with his broad hand its width
almost as great as arlennas slim body and
laid it on her shoulder

  i treasure you even above my crown
arlenna he waited for an answer but
the girl merely lay there fixing him with
her wide eyes you are beautiful ar-
lenna you will be the first among all my
wives you will bear me a son and that
son will reign as king it is a great honor
to be the bride of durga-rama

  when still she said nothing the usurper
twisted his strong lips in a smile you
have not caressed me arlenna

 no she whispered please-

  i will wait soon the magic waters of
the altar of isis will touch our lips mean-
ing that we are mates

  the tepoi was carried to the edge of the
native street then borne back to the tem-
ple of isis

  durga-rama stepped from between its
draperies carrying arlenna in his arms
he took her through the door toward the
altar where incense was still smoldering
though the priests had fled he filled a
golden chalice with water and held it to
the girls lips she sipped once and he
quaffed the remainder he slammed the
chalice down and wiped his lips with the
back of his hairy hand and he looked at
her with an added possessiveness by this
act the ancient laws of ramfis said she
was his

  he bore her back to the tepoi and left her
there as the custom of ramfis willed it
she would be taken to the rooms of her
husband to wait while he celebrated his
marriage in flagons of wine with his chiefs

  the sun dropped from sight and dark-
ness crept in from the jungle covering the
city there were not many of the brown
men left most of them having joined the
rebellion but these cheered the tyrant and
drank his health

  the drinking finished he strode to the
courtyard of his house

  there he paused to inspect his guards-

stories

  men ten of them were patrolling the
stockade

  there is need of extra caution he
said that coward army of liikes may
sneak back like jackals in the dark or
perhaps ki-gor himself looking for his
mate whom i sold to the tamtamba watch
for them and let no one disturb me you
hear-no one

  he climbed the stairway to his rooms
panthra was guarding the door the lion
rose fixing durga-rama with his savage
eyes durga-rama opened the door tak-
ing the beast inside with him he stood
for a moment looking around at the room
as it was revealed by the flickering grease
lamp arlenna was there in her robe of
blue silk sitting on the edge of a skin-cov-
ered pallet he closed the door dropped
its bar of ironwood in place looped pan-
thras leash to a peg then with heavy
lips twisting in a smile he advanced toward
his bride

  my dear he said looking on her my
dear i have come to you do not fear i
can be cruel but i can be gentle  to
those who are beautiful

crocodiles still lay on mudbars
but they were too drugged by the
heat of the afternoon to move when ki-
gor and the others recrossed the river

  ki-gor called a halt at the far shore
and the party rested helene sat with
her hand closed in the hand of her jungle
mate today there was something both-
ering her and ki-gor with his keen per-
ception noticed it

  what is it helene  he asked

  it is brend she said in a voice that
the boy could not hear have you for-
gotten that he is in love too

  i have not forgotten but neither can
we fight durga-rama in the open by our-
selves tonight i will make another jour-
ney within the walls perhaps this time i
will he able to plan a course of action with
liike

  for a time ki-gor lay stretched on a
tree limb sleeping in the manner he had
grown used to when a boy he awoke
with long shadows creeping through the
the lost beasts of tatamba



jungle helene and brend had already
made out a supper on bananas and a va-
riety of small breadfruit they had found
growing in a bower of okume trees but
such foods were not the kind to satisfy
either ki-gor or the pigmy chieftain
ngeeso they shared a mans craving
for meat and in a few minutes hunt they
had found it-a tiny moloko antelope
which ki-gor empaled on an arrow they
ate the fresh red meat and it gave them
instant strength-lasting strength of the
kind ki-gor well might need before that
night was finished

  with shadows settling over the jungle
footpath they again made their way
toward ramfis

  as was their custom at such time mar-
mo served to carry all except ki-gor who
ranged ahead watching the jungle to make
certain that no trap had been laid

  ki-gor had been gone for a considerable
time and helene was lying on her back
watching the branches above expecting
momentarily to see him come dropping
from nowhere when suddenly marmo
came to a stop ki-gor was standing in
the path holding an old woman by the
wrist

  can you talk to this woman brend
i found her running from the direction of
the city and she will say nothing in a
tongue i can understand

  raga cried brend sliding down mar-
mos broad side why this is raga a
slave in the home of arlenna rago do
you recognize me i am brend

  the old slave woman almost wept when
she saw him they said you were dead
durga-rjama told arlenna you were dead

    

  but i am not dead here i will let
you see for yourself i am no scorcerers
vision feel my flesh raga

  the old woman ran her dry hands over
his arms muttering tearfully all the time

  what are you doing running through
the jungle at night raga

  aii he has taken her from -us  she
wailed that evil woman whose soul has
been eaten by the jin she came for her this

afternoon-

  tell me the one she came for

  for arlenna that kadala came and

said i must annoint arlennas body so she
would be ready to go to durga-rama the
girl begged me to help her escape i tried
i tried master but that sorceress kadala
was waiting she would have killed me
she would have thrown me to the hounds
and had the flesh torn off my ancient bones
had i not run from her i crept from the
gate while they were carrying out the
bodies of those who fell in the fighting



  then there was a fight asked ki-
gor who had now picked up the peculiari-
ties of the slave tongue

  there was a fight master she said
backing from fear of him for she had seen
him battle in the arena and still regarded
him as some strange avenging messenger
of the gods

  ki-gor said there was a revolt and
durga-rama broke it with his own guards
and a hundred of the tatamba-is that
not true

  yes master she whispered thinking
him more than ever a god

  has the marriage feast been yet

  they would have now drunk the mar-
riage potion

  and arlenna was to go to him imme-
diately 

  it is the custom for a bridegroom to
drink wine with his warrior friends until
nightfall

  but nightfall is still not here said
ki-gor grimly his hand closing powerfully
on his hunting knife perhaps with the
help of twilight and the gods there is yet
time

  what is your plan asked helene
sliding from the head of marmo to stand
beside him

  we cannot give the maiden to that
beast i will go in alone-

  not alone ki-gor i cannot let--

  yes alone it is the safest way

  when he spoke in that manner helene
had learned the futility of argument she
knew too that in such matters ki-gor
was invariably right

  he turned once again to the slave
woman how many were killed in the
battle

  perhaps ten of durga-ramas men and
twenty of those who followed liike
	jungle

  and how many of liiffes men es-
caped 

  as many as the fingers and toes of two
men

  forty with the help of marmo and
myself those forty should be enough

  and me ki-gor do not forget ngee-
so  said the pigmy chief trying the points
of his sharp little arrows

  ki-gor nodded and you my brave
ngeeso

 but they are gone  wailed raga beat-
ing knuckles against her old flat breast
they are gone and ramfis is lost

  gone in what direction

  across the fields toward the high
ridge

  brend you know the trails of this val-
ley you will go with us to the edge of
the clearing from there you will circle
alone and follow the trail left by the army
of liike helene and ngeeso will stay in
the jungle while i find an entrance to the
city with good fortune your army will
return and with the help of marmo we
can drive that hireling army of tatamba
cannibals into the river

k-gor tossed brend to marmos back
and in a few minutes they could see
the big dancing fires of ramfis through the
gathering twilight tom-toms were beat-
ing and voices came with a high-pitched
chant indicating that the blacks were cele-
brating the marriage of durga-rama sev-
eral guards could be seen pacing back and
forth along the wall surrounding durga-
ramas house upstairs lamplight shone
with a reddish glow through a tiny barred
window

  in accordance with ki-gors instruc-
tions bren started off at a swift trot to
circle the clearing helene and ngeeso
waited beside marmo even the mighty
tusker seemed ill at ease as though he
too wondered how ki-gor would gain en-
trance without falling victim to the sharp
assagais of durga-ramas guards

  ki-gor disappeared for a moment then
came in sight again on a branch above
he climbed higher and higher until he was
close to the swaying top of the tallest
baobab tree there he found the vine he
had fixed the evening of his first visit and

stories

tested its strength

   with the end of it in his hand ki-gor
swung slowly higher and higher toward
the wall and far back in the bowers of
the jungle at the apex of his swing he
could have released his hold and sailed over
the stockade wall of the brown mens city
as he had done before but tonight with
guards thick around durga-ramas court-
yard wall such a leap would not be suf-
ficient he must not only gain entrance
to the city the leap must place him on
durga-ramas house itself

   he hesitated for a while waiting for the
twilight to thicken when night descends
there is a flickering moment of neither
light nor darkness a moment when a mans
eyes will tell him things he does not be-
lieve-a time when darkness in a heavy
layer along the earth with a flare of light
still lingering along the western horizon
that was the moment for which ki-gor
waited

  the moment came he leaned for-
ward judging the course of his swing
his feet left the branch down he went
the vine swinging through air he was
an uncertain blur through darkness as he
lifted his legs at the bottom of the arc to
avoid the tops of low bushes he swung
up and out far over the wall with tim-
ing developed by years of jungle travel he
judged the exact fraction of time and re-
laxed his hold he seemed poised a dim
object against the dim sky then he plum-
meted down and his feet touched the
thatch-covered ridge-pole of duga-ramas
house as silently as the velvet paws of a
leopard

   ki-gor moved stealthily along the ridge-
pole shifting his weight as though the
house were some delicate scale and he
feared tipping its balance it was not the
sound of his passage across the soft thatch
which he feared would be noticed below-
it would be bits of grass sifting down to
tell of his movement

  he found the place through which he
forced his way the evening before it had
not been patched a ragged bit of light
showed from durga-ramas rooms he
laid full length peering down nothing
was visible except an area of floor covered
by woven raffia mats but he could hear
the lost beasts of tatamba



sounds of footsteps approaching along the
stairs the complaining squeak of wooden
hinges as the door opened something
about these sounds told him it was durga-
rama who had entered

  ki-gor heard the sudden drawing in of
arlennas breath then durga-rama
again

  do not fear me my dear

  ki-gor could tell by the shadows that
she was retreating from him

  he lowered his head and shoulders
through the opening in the thatch and for
the first time caught sight of durga-rama
and the girl he had seized her by the
wrists and twisted until her lovely young
face was drawn with pain she sank kneel-
ing before him

  panthra snarled and slammed the end
of his leash his nostrils having warned
him that ki-gor was near the sound
broke durga-ramas preoccupation still
gripping the girls wrist he turned to see
what had disturbed the lion ki-gor knew
he must act

  he went head foremost through the roof
caught a bamboo beam flipping himself
over in the air so that he landed on his feet
crouching

  durga-rama snapped the girl by her
arm flinging her at ki-gor it was a
brutal unexpected movement

  durga-rama seized a long-handled bat-
tle-axe and swung it high

ke-gor had no time to draw his knife
he moved close the axe swung
past his head he caught the handle on his
shoulder with a quick movement he
seized the big man by wrist and the front
of his robe lifted him overhead and
hurled him across the room

  arlenna screamed eyes on the door ki-
gor saw the lion at the same instant he
had cut his leash with his teeth and had
launched himself into air fangs bared for
ki-gors throat

  they collided with the wall and ki-gor
went down with panthra straddling him

  ki-gor kept his grip on the lions throat
their strength was balanced then slowly
by infinitesimal degrees the jungle mans
superb muscles made themselves felt

  ki-gor thrust the lion back to the length

of his arms with a twisting motion he
rolled over he snatched his knife that
had fallen to the matting crouched the
blade ready

  panthra let out a raging snarl he lo-
cated ki-gor and did not hesitate he
sprang again and quick as a released ar-
row the knife came around

  ki-gor leaped straddling his back he
braced his legs lifting the animal in the
air his knife swung up and descended
panthra stiffened and then fell backward
at the feet of the jungle man blood com-
ing in rapid spurts from the wound

  durga-rama had now risen to one knee
the scimitar was in his right hand his
eyes were on ki-gor he twisted his lips
in a smile keeping his little swine eyes
on the knife in ki-gors hand

  we will throw aside our weapons as i
count thrice agreed

  it is agreed

  at the word three he made a move-
ment as though to toss away the long scim-
itar his quick crafty eyes saw ki-gors
knife start through the air but instead
of dropping his own weapon durga-rama
merely let it roll in his hand and then re-
captured it with a practiced motion

  one step durga-rama advanced-two
the time was right he sprang swinging
the scimitar with a horizontal stroke-
the same powerful stroke that had chop-
ped the retreating tatamba completely
in half that afternoon

  but ki-gor was no longer there he
had vanished like some genie seen in a
witch-doctors fire the scimitar sang
through the air its heavy weight whipping
durga-rama around

  he fought for balance and he saw ki-
gor crouched hand between his knees
gripping the knife

  durga-rama backed towards the door
triumph had left his eyes there was
only fear there now-the primeval fear of
death he reached behind him for the
ironwood bar but ki-gor moved and
durga-rama dashed along the wall to avoid
him

  help me he bellowed to his guards
hear me down there a white devil you
have let in break the door and help me

  men commenced shouting below bare
	jungle

feet thudded the stairs assagai points rat-
tled along the wall someone tried the
door and found it barred

  break in the door you fool bellowed
durga-rama moving along the wall like
a caged hyena it is ki-gor dropped
down on me from the roof while you dogs
were sleeping

  more guardsmen were coming ki-gor
could hear them jabbering to one another
they flung themselves against the door
but for the moment its timbers held firm

  an assagai stood against the wall ki-
gor seized it held it poised durga-rama
believing it was to be hurled at him
plunged for cover ki-gor laughed he
would not kill the man with an assagai it
would be too easy he would kill him with
the knife instead he aimed the shaft at
the door

  that assagai stopped the others from
smashing the door but they could fire
poisoned arrows through the rent it had
torn durga-rama was still on the move
he saw his chance as ki-gor leaped to
avoid an arrow and charged swinging the
scimitar like an axe

  for a fragment of time ki-gor caught
the blade on the guard of his knife he
stepped aside as the scimitar swung toward
the floor then he leaped in striking for
durga-rmas heart

- durga-rama saw the blow coming he
twisted a trifle trying to avoid it the
blade struck but it missed his heart he
let fall the scimitar and reeled across the
room clutching his breast

  ki-gor did not stop to finish him no
time for that the black guard saw his
shoulder turned and commenced smashing
in the door he saw arlenna held his
arm for her she came to him for a
moment he held her close against his per-
fect body and he could feel her sweet
warm breath against his arm then he
sprang reached a rafter and swung with
the skill of a great ape hooking it with his
legs still holding the girl with one arm

  panthra his life blood pumping away
through the chest wound dragged himself
up his untamed eyes fastening themselves
on durga-rama

  durga-rama had captured him as a
cub through fear the lion had come to

stories

recognize him as master he paid him
obedience that the man mistook for love
but there is no space for love in the heart
of a great cat durga-rjama was down
with warm blood flowing between his fin-
gers and he was master no longer the
hate that had always lurked in panthras
heart flamed now unchecked with his
final resource of strength he sprang set-
ting his terrible fangs in durga-ramas
unprotected throat

  ki-gor swung close to the ridgepole
helping the girl through the roof opening
flames were already turning the room into
a furnace they roared with new draught
as the guardsmen smashed open the door

  then from the edge of the jungle came
the high-pitched trumpeting of marmo-
the charging cry of the african bull ele-
phant

  ki-gor waited as flames licked closer
holding the girl so her body would be pro-
tected from arrows it was a few seconds
before the guardsmen realized what was
thundering towards them the outer stock-
ade crashed beneath marrhos avalanche of
muscle light from the burning house
shone on his sweeping tusks

  at that moment with every eye drawn
away ki-gor lifted the girl and sprang
to earth he placed her behind him whip-
ped the strong-bow from his shoulder and
drove arrows in a deadly stream as guards-
men fell over one another to escape the
wrath of marmo

  ki-gor caught marmo by one of his fan-
like ears the beast stopped helene and
ngeeso were on his back and he wanted
them to take no chance with poisoned ar-
rows from the guards who had fled to the
native village

  the house became a torch sending its
flames higher and higher then it slumped
and as quickly became only a heap of coals

  brend came a few minutes later leading
liikes army at a swift trot his men
paused a few strides distant still fearing
the white lord although brend called him
friend

  arlenna what of arlenna you
have saved her   

  we have saved her and the usurper is
dead i think you will have little more
trouble in ramfis
 the long fear

by walter james sheldon

in the native villages john mcdall had seen white men
with the long fear broken with fever perpetual terror in
their eyes it didnt take long once it began  

when the sun dropped the thoki	leaner his skin was as brown as the

chanted in the near distance pe-	winding tshuappa and his eyes yellow-

 trius corput turned to his guide and said	gray like the sky near the horizon in hot

that is what i want	countries he had been recommended in

the guide frowned he changed his	coquilhatville

position in the deck chair and tamped a not tonight frowned john mcdall
pipe that was already set to smoke he and why not may i ask when cor-
was leaner than corput this guide much put raised his eyebrows it was as though

wazala rolled his eyes and called out a mad screaming death chant   	

-jungle-winter
	jungle

to lift them out of the reach of ordinary
people they were sparse and blond cor-
put himself was big heavy his skin
seemed inflated with flesh he had a
booming voice and just enough of his
dutch accent mcdall supposed to make
his travel lectures intriguing

  mcdall nodded toward the bow of the
long flat-bottomed boat the blacks were
gathered there in a squatting circle about
jobi the little twisted one listening as he
muttered andgestured and rolled his eyes
and threw in words of manoc the witch
doctor tongue that no white man had ever
learned theyre too keyed up tonight
mcdall said making a recording might
set them off-theyd probably desert
they dont like recordings when you
take away mens voices you take some-
thing of their souls

  so corput grinned showing a gold
tooth maybe you yourself believe
that 

  mcdall looked at the big man sharply
that was the way with corput-he sensed
the deepest of your fears and then his
words became probes seeking nerve ends
mcdall hadnt wanted to take him to
ngani country in the first place but
then this was his last trip he wanted to
get it over with   

  his last trip the thought made
champagne of his blood after fifteen
years he hadnt the fortune he came for
but he had enough at least to go back
to the states and retire it was almost
done now they had been on the tshu-
appa for - ten days two weeks he
would have to consult the log days
went by with a drugged step here the
river was flat and sluggish and it wound
like a huge python sometimes through
great flat carpets of reeds and some-
times through thick choked musty jun-
gle always the sun and the river suck-
ing the spirit from a man was it any
wonder that after fifteen years one spoke
quite offhandedly about such things as
juju

  the boys believe it thats the point
said mcdall he began finally to light
his pipe

corput leaned far forward making
the canvas chair creak now you lis-

stories

ten to me mr mcdall he said i let
you have your way from the first day
because i was told you knew what to do
but you have been too slow and too
lenient with these blacks we hire i
think your were foolish to allow this jobi

this little hunchback to come along-

  jobis valuable mcdall said quickly
true he cant pole or carry much but
he does little jobs that would be beneath
the others mpifo-that prestige of theirs
besides they like to have him he knows
some of the witch doctors art and he has
influence with them hes helped me
out with that on other trips

  then it is simple said corput he
clapped his fleshy palms together if
they do not like our recording of this
chant jobi will pacify them

  mcdall met the lecturers watery blue
eyes they were set so far into corputs
cheeks that he had to dig them out with
his own stare why this chant this
particular one this is only thoki coun-
try and well pass through it soon now

when we reach the ngani-

  my friend said corput tapping the
guides knee will you accept the fact
that i know my business this chant we
hear now is-well dramatic it sounds
like what people would expect of a native
chant

  and do you realize what it is
asked mcdall

  corput shook his head i dont care
what it is i can make up any story for
it i choose it is the chant i like and
we are going to record it he rose sud-
denly with disconcerting agility for his
bulk he moved to the tent-like cabin
amidships and began to unsnap the cover
of the presto recorder

  mcdall puffed his pipe just a shade
faster wrinkles formed near the bridge
of his nose and pulled at his heavy brows
a faker this corput and his worshipping
audience never dreamed it a man who
breezed through far-off places gathering
just enough dust to show hed been there
was it to be deplored corput was
nearly a millionaire and john mcdall had
only enough to retire modestly

  perhaps juju had an answer for such
things
the long fear



mcdall frowned he would have
to watch those thoughts about juju
a man could believe too strongly after
too many years a mans fear could grow
in the towns mcdall had seen white men
with the long fear broken with fever per-
petual terror ire their eyes it didnt take
long once it began   

  corput was watching the volume indi-
cator and setting the level for the record-
ing machine he had the microphone
with its parabolic shield atop two wooden
cases facing the jungle he grinned as
he moved the cutting stylus to- the inside
of the record perfect boomed his
deep voice this lecture will have all
the elements of a best seller eh i
will call this a fertility chant

  its hardly that said mcdall dryly
raising his eyes

  so corput blinked what is it
then

   its a thoki curse on their enemies
the ngani the two tribes have always
hated each other the thoki belong to
the river spirits and the ngani to the for-
est the thoki are agricultural the
ngani hunters its strange that the
thoki manage to keep the ngani away
as well as they do their river gods
probably have some pretty strong juju
corput laughed heartily and shook his
head by joe you do believe it eh
well take it from me it sounds more
like a fertility chant and that is what
i shall call it

  corput swung the stylus down to the
shiny acetate surface the record began
to cut

  jobi the twisted one stopped his soft
exhortation of the others and stared at
the recorder his black eyes ringed with
white cornea moved toward the jungle
then and pulled his round head with
them his mouth was closed tightly he
stared into the bottle green thickness that
came all the way to the rivers edge
where the boat lay he stared as though
able to see through it all the way to the
thoki village he stared as though
watching the council gathered at the hut
of the medicine man as though he could
see the latters painted grill-like mask
and watch the gnarled hand strike in

subtle cadence at the wooden drum boom
boom-boom boom boom-boom and
wound around the beat like a serpent on
a limb the sinuous chant yo yo nu-
tufya ngani yo yo nutufya ngani

  jobi suddenly left his place and
scuttled crab-like to the stern he squat-
ted at the side of mcdalls chair his
great eyes torches in a midnight face
looked up at the guide evil bondela
he said in the native tongue the fat
white man steals the thoki juju the
thoki river gods will punish all of us
mcdall nodded quite seriously you
couldnt laugh at these children you
couldnt even pretend not to laugh they
would sense that you had to adjust your
own mind to theirs while you talked to
them and that was the only way that
there would be communication

  jobi said mcdall you know the
huts where gods live the trails where
gods pass you must ask them not to
punish us

  jobi shook his round head the fat
white man must not steal thoki juju
the fat white man is my bondela i
cannot tell him

  aiee said jobi i will talk to the
river gods

  mcdall turned his eyes toward corput
and saw that the big man had been watch-
ing and that he was shaking his head
sadly the chant and the drum beat still
came from the jungle the hot humid
night held time and the senses in suspen-
sion only the brown river moved and
this so slowly that it made no noise nor
look of moving mcdall felt a drop of
sweat roll down the side of his body un-
der his loose khaki shirt he shuddered
and was angry for it

  the next morning they were moving
up the river again-out of thoki coun-
try on toward the ngani stamping
grounds-and mcdall thought this how
could i have been so foolish corput had
recorded his chant and nothing had hap-
pened nothing at all of course noth-
ing had happened the only thing to fear
was the long fear itself the purely imag-
inary thing in mcdalls mind

  corput had eaten a hearty breakfast
and he was outlining his congo lecture
	jungle

on the portable typewriter he had never
looked healthier the blacks were poling
their shoulder-blades rippling under dark
glossy skin they were laughing and jok-
ing among themselves

  jobi squatted in the bw and mended
canvas there was nothing in his face
but a happy concentration on his imme-
diate task

  and john mcdall knew then that he
must not delay in leaving the congo
that this must in truth be his last trip
that he must not succumb to the tempta-
tion to go upriver again reality and
unreality were fusing much too closely
together in his mind he was thinking na-
tive and before he knew it he would be-
gin to act native

here here was the perfect ex-
ample they were at the edge of
ngani country already and without
seeing any signs without seeing anything
but the broad river and the dense jungle
without hearing anything but the slip-
slap of the water and the flurry of an oc-
casional reed bird john mcdall had sud-
denly become tense and uneasy there
was no reason for it oh hed have a
mountain to clear away when he returned
to civilization and he must begin to
realize now that there was no juju that
what seemed magic was only cause and
effect and no more mysterious than cor-
puts clacking typewriter or the record-
ing machine-

  corput damn him had noticed again
he had seen the way mcdall was think-
ing his typing had stopped and he was
holding that fat superior smile upon mc-
dall why do you not cheer up my
friend corput boomed at him yon
know you have much to be thankful for i
understand this is your last trip and cer-
tainly i make it an easy one eh 

  mcdall shrugged you dont exactly
knock yourself out in your quest for
knowledge if thats what you mean

  it amused corput his chuckle sound-
ed like a small waterfall in his chest you
are a sentimental fellow he grinned
but then that makes you not much dif-
ferent from most people myself i look
always at the cold logic of a thing you

stories

probably think i am a faker he clapped

his hands together you know- am

and i also enjoy myself and make lots of
money while a hundred learned professors
must worry about their grocery bills you
would like further proof look at you

the way you sit there-and your face

says that you are afraid but you dont

know what you are afraid of-

  i was thinking about the ngani thats
all said mcdall stirring uncomfortably
theyre tricky people we probably
wont have any trouble with them because
we wont stay long enough and im sure
you wont try to learn very much from
them just the same theyre strange and
you cant tell what theyll do next theyre
insane by our standards he smiled
slowly of course we white men are in-
sane by theirs

  thats difficult for you eh said cor-
put holding the guide with his pale eye
to have the natives think you are not
like them that is hard eh mr mcdall
you have been in this country too long
mcdall drew a deep breath and stif-
fened himself against the anger that
pounded at his ear drums he must not
quarrel with this man his purpose was
beyond that he must finish this last trip
of his and then go home as he had
planned no emotion must interfere

and john mcdall for the next
few days found it increasingly dif-
ficult to keep from exploding against pe-
trius corput the man had a malicious
evil intelligence he understood completely
the tortures of a human soul but he had
no sympathy none at all he was a men-
tal bully he took every opportunity to
suggest that mcdall was succumbing to
the jungle to the long fear he twisted

every little act into evidence of it-if

mcdall would so much as frown at his
food before eating it corput would ask if
he were searching for evil spirits this
was the way petrius corput amused him-
self as the days and the river went by and
behind them

  mcdall on his cot at night more than
once had the sudden feeling that an evil
spirit had got into corput and was using
him to bedevil mcdall every time that
the long fear



thought came to him he would strain to
drive it away he would curse himself
and tell himself that he couldnt think
logically like a white man anymore   

  they shored the boat finally in the
heart of ngani country the land the
river and the sky had changed gradually
so that they hadnt noticed and didnt
realize it until they began to wonder what
was different and then looked about them
and saw this was higher country and
everything was bigger the reeds the
creamy thunderheads every afternoon and
the jungle itself the crocodiles that
slipped abruptly from the shore into the
brown water were longer the birds that
startled them were shriller and more
brightly plumed

  their own natives laughed and joked
less and seemed not so much like chil-
dren anymore when jobi talked to them
his voice was lower than ever he used
more of the manoc words

  they had seen none of the ngani yet
but at night they heard the drums sev-
eral times they thought they saw distant
fires in the jungle that the ngani knew
they had come they had no doubt

  mcdall for the first time broke open a
bottle of brandy for himself and corput
roared with mirth and pointed his fat
finger when he caught him at it

  on the afternoon of the fourth day the
sky was clear and the sun merciless there
was a great stillness as though this part
of the world had been thrown suddenly
into a state of suspended animation the
blacks lay sleeping or just staring along
the gunwales seeking tiny spots of shade
corput was under the canvas awning cor-
recting with pencil some of his typewrit-
ten sheets mcdall sat nearby carefully
oiling the rifles against the terrible damp
of the congo he watched a three inch
cockroach nibble at the callouses of a sleep-
ing natives soles and felt too stifled too
detached to do anything about it

  weary listlessly he turned his head to
where jobi usually squatted in the bow
the hunchback was still squatting but
raised a little and on the tips of his toes
as though about to spring at something
his spidery arms hooked the edge of the
gunwale he had his bent rounded fea-

tures turned toward the jungle his head
was cocked slightly    listening   

  what do you hear asked mcdall in
jobis tongue

  the query startled the little native he
jerked his head toward mcdall and
showed white-ringed eyes his mouth was
slightly parted and the breath went
through it with a low harsh sound
ngani he said

  corput looked up and grunted making
the grunt say all the contemptuous words
he knew

  if jobi says the ngani are near mc-
dall said you can bet that they are he
senses these things ive seen him do it
before

  it was no longer necessary for corput
to say in so many words that mcdall was
bush crazy all he had to do now was
smile and lift his eyebrows

  mcdall tried to ignore it he tried to
keep his voice even let me warn you
once more corput you may have more
than you bargained for with the ngani
theres a reason why so few white men
have ever seen them theyre entirely too
mad and unpredictable i dont like the
way its going

  the way what is going my friend
corput blinked with deceptive mildness

  everything the-well the feeling

in the air around here mcdall gestured
vaguely then he deepened his scowl arid
moistened lips which were suddenly dry
he knew he must sound like the greatest
of fools he wished he hadnt tried to ex-
plain what he felt for he knew now that
to corput it would be inexplicable

  corput slapped his fat knee and roared
with laughter ah-you are more na-
tive every day the feeling in the air
the evil spirits eh admit it mcdall
that is what you were trying to say was
it not you believe in them you know
you do

  mcdall heard a noise that was like an
explosion inside of his skull for the
smallest part of an instant a red curtain
flashed in front of his eyes the big ar-
tery in his neck became choked with an-
gry blood damn you corput he
swore he sprang from his chair drop-
ping the rifle to the duck boards he
	jungle

thrust his hands forward and saw that his
fingers had formed themselves into claws
kill kill kill with the hands   

  he gasped hungrily for breath the
choking sensation had gone away he
realized that he was standing there a -
step away from corput trembling all over
corput was just losing the momentary
fear that had been in his pale sunken
eyes

  you are in a serious condition my
friend said corput frowning with a
sympathy that mcdall knew could not be
real you had better sit down    re-
lax perhaps its the heat   

  there was a sudden commotion in the
boat the boys were rising crowding the
shore side jabbering and pointing toward
the jungle as mcdall and corput too
looked in that direction they saw the first
of the tall warriors emerge from the trees

  there they are said mcdall the
ngani

  corput moved his bulk immediately to
the side of the boat he stood there huge
looming his pink-skinned arms folded
across his chest and he frowned mightily
at the tall black men who came toward
him there were twelve of them they
carried shields and spears and all were
painted with white and blue paint the
man at their head the tallest wore feath-
ers and bones on his head he stopped
raised his hand and said endoko tofa
la bonyolo

  here we have no chain to bind you
translated mcdall he means that you
are welcome to his country

corput grunted all right tell
him thanks or whatever one is sup-
posed to say tell him i wish to visit his
village tell him that i have gifts and
that we will exchange i must bring some-
thing back from this place do they know
about cameras see what you can do
about my taking pictures

  mcdall looked at corput oddly for a
moment then turned to the tall native and
uttered a brief phrase the ngani leader
replied just as briefly

  what did he say asked corput

  i asked him his health and if he had
many wives mcdall answered it

stories

would be very impolite to get down to
business just yet

  fools said corput sadly shaking his
head no wonder they are savages all
right mr mcdall you handle it your
own way but i want to get to their vil-
lage as soon as possible it will be just
another stinking native village but no
other white man has ever been there and
that makes it good material he added
a short cynical laugh

  mcdall and the ngani leader talked
some more the native had narrow al-
most caucasian features and eyes with a
suggestion of oriental slant he spoke in
a slow quiet voice with great dignity
but with a feeling of suppressed tension
every once in a while his eyes would
wander from side to side as if to confirm
a thought with the other men who accom-
panied him

  mcdall continued to translate each re-
mark knowing that the ngani expected
it his name is wazala he told cor-
put and he is chief of the ngani he
says he knew we were coming but that
the spirits had also told them that the
thoki might make war soon that was
why they didnt greet us before

  come on mcdall never mind all that
lets break open the gifts and get him to
take us to his village

  mcdall looked back for just a suspend-
ed instant i wouldnt go there if i were
you he said

  what  why not 

  theres something wrong theyre not
acting just right i dont know what it
is but theyre up to some trickery wed
better stay here and let them show their
hand first

  mcdall please do not be foolish
sighed corput

  im serious deadly serious youll

have to take my word for it-but i can

sense that somethings wrong nothing i
can tell you in so many words but i know
it just as surely as i know your name and
mine

  mr mcdall said corput slowly fix-
ing both eyes on the guide i am going
to the ngani village alone if necessary
i will thank you to do the job for which
i am paying you and arrange this matter
the long fear



as soon as possible

  all right said mcdall quietly all
right corput youre the bondela he
turned and palavered at length with the
ngani chief

  the boat boys and porters meanwhile
had pressed themselves into a tight group
near the bow and were staring at the
ngani delegation there was wariness
which bordered on fear in their eyes jobi
watched the tall warriors carefully and
muttered to himself in the quietest of
tones mcdall felt one with jobi and the
others there was evil in the air here
and it was the worst kind of evil because
it could not be seen or heard or smelled
or touched with the fingers it could only
be felt inside mcdall could feel it the
only difference between mcdall and the
boys was that he could keep it from show-
ing in his eyes

  he caught a phrase from jobis mutter-
ing ibwa wete joi ja nkakamwa death
is a strange thing and he had all he could
do to keep himself from nodding and re-
peating the phrase

  he finally faced corput and said wa-
zala will have you as his guest in the
ngani village

  good said corput now you are be-
ing sensible he swung his bulk back
to the awning slung the camera over his
shoulders and then stepped out again

  id take a pistol mcdall said

  you take it i have enough to carry
already

  im not going said mcdall

  you are not going corputs eye-
brows rose for a moment then fell again
he shrugged be a fool mcdall but
let me make a prophecy like your witch
doctors too eh let me say that you
will never leave this country you will
rot here with the mind eaten from your
head rest well while i am gone mr
mcdall and try to stay sane at least long
enough to get me back to coquilhatville
a moment later john mcdall stood in
the sun and watched petrius corput sur-
rounded by tall ngani disappear into the
hot heavy darkness of the jungle he
stood there and looked at the spot where
they had disappeared he watched for
the time that it took him to fill his pipe

and tamp every last flake of tobacco care-
fully into place with his thumb when he
finally turned to go back to the awning
he saw that jobi was still staring

  he smiled a little there is sun al-
ways the next dky and the next he said
to jobi in native dialect

  jobi didnt answer mcdall wasnt even
sure that he had heard

that night mcdall deliberately
made himself busy so that he would
think as little as possible he cleaned the
guns twice over and he did the same with
corputs typewriter and then began to go
over the recording equipment the disc
bearing the thoki chant was still on the
turntable where corput had left it
frowning at the mans slovenliness mc-
dall himself brushed away the fine ace-
tate shavings from the grooves he felt
that someone was behind him looking
and he turned and saw jobi

  juju said jobi he looked around
him in air

  mcdall nodded yes i know he
was quite serious he wasnt humoring
jobi at all

  the boat boys stirred and whispered
among themselves something splashed
far up the river only a croc or hippo--
but then it was well known that the evil
spirits sometimes took the form of these
creatures although there was no breeze
the limbs of the trees could be heard
slithering a bird screeched

  then they heard the drums begin and
the boat boys suddenly stopped whisper-
ing and all around them the jungle be-
came still and listened too

 boom boom-boom

  mcdall knew almost from the first
note that it was a different rhythm this
time he turned his head slowly to look
for the answer in jobis face jobi was
frowning concentrating

 what do the drums say mcdall
asked

  jobi waited for a long moment before
answering the fat white man brings
with him a thoki river god it is fore-
told that the thoki invade and the fat
white man must die

  years ago mcdall would have asked
	jungle

the hunchback how he knew how he could
possibly know all that just from hearing
the drums he would have done that or
else he might have laughed at him and
disbelieved him completely now he only

nodded and in jobis own language-

thinking it not just speaking it-he

said the gods use the ngani to punish
the fat white man

  it is so death is a strange thing
answered jobi

  mcdalls own mind seemed to be swim-
ming it seemed not to be his own mind
but a very different one that had been
formed separately from him by the steam-
ing jungle and then somehow magically
exchanged for the soul that he had orig-
inally brought here the feel of the air
was different now he was floating
through endless damp time and there was
nothing but the jungle and the gods who
passed about and through it there were
no tomorrows and no yesterdays there
were not even words for them in the lan-
guage in which he thought he saw that
he had been cleaning the recording equip-
ment and of a sudden that seemed silly
to him insane there was no reason to
work now one did not starve one
might work a little for jilo-meat hun-
ger-one might vie with his friends in

hunting fishing fighting hewing the
canoe but one did not exert himself oft-
ener than he had to

  the drums were still going

  yes jobi was right that was what
they were saying that the fat white man
brought the thoki river god and that the
fat white man must die

  there he could understand the
drums

  now h was one of them now he was
like jobi and wazala and all the rest
oh the white men would laugh and scorn
and point to him now and shake their
heads and say too long here but it
didnt matter bendele bafa bmito white
men werent people

  there was something warm in his hand
he looked the pipe bowl with the spot
of pink fire smoldering in it a strange
thing a white mans pipe he put it
into the corner of his mouth and drew
upon it something happened something

stories

clicked within his mind and suddenly he
couldnt understand the drums any more-
john mcdall stood and shook as though
with fever the sweat ran in sheets down
his brow and cheeks and it wasnt a
warm natural sweat almost desperately
he took another long pull on his pipe
that had been close for a moment he

had gone native bush crazy-whatever

you wanted to call it he must get out of
this land quickly quickly but there
was a job to do first he was still a white
man and there was a job that a white man
must do

   jobi he said listen with care there
is something you must do for me and
you must not fail

  jobi gave the standard native answer

the formality mpo-kuseya- cant

but he answered that he was the brother
of mdaiw bondela and then he paid
strictest attention as mcdall outlined what
he wanted in the most careful and thor-
ough way he went over it three times
so that jobi would be sure to understand

minutes later mcdall had left the
boat he was trotting through the
moon speckled dimness of the jungle and
keeping his steps turned toward the sound
of the drum it was getting louder and
mcdall knew that it could not be far
away he followed the native path that
was already cut through the thick growth
the narrow corridor with room for only
one man to pass and he kept on it in the
semi-darkness partly through feeling ahead
of him and partly through long experience
in traversing the jungle

  the creepers the leaves and grasses
slapped at him from both sides of the
path a vine caught the carivas belt from
which his pistol and bush knife hung it
stopped him short nearly throwing him
flat on his back he untangled it care-
fully then kept going perhaps his years
in this country had worn his mind but
they had made his body wiry and tough
and they had adjusted his lungs and heart
to the warm syrupy air he could go oni
like this through the forest always keep-
ing that steady trot--whereas most
white men might have fallen exhausted
after the first few hundred yards
the long fear



  now the drums were loud pressing at
his ears he could feel the vibrations in
his feet he was near dangerously near
to the ngani village the jungle was
thinning somewhat the green tangle on
either side of the path was more pen-
etrable

  he left the path and pushed on through
the underbrush

  he reached the ngani village so abrupt-
ly that he almost walked out into it before
he saw it he drew back quickly into the
shadows again he crouched and looked

  all about the fire they were the tall
snake-like ngani in an undulating circle
their arms linked the paint on their faces
gleaming with the flickering light they
were in a large open space between the
huts of split reeds and just beyond the
fire under the racks of dried- meat squat-
ted wazala chief of the ngani

  wazala rolled his slanted eyes upward
and called out a mad screaming chant
the line of warriors barked a response
the women iif the line beyond that
shrilled horribly nothing on earth can
be quite so shrill as a congo woman

 now mcdall saw petrius corput
stretched horizontally between two logs
his face and belly toward the black night
sky his limbs spread

  corput screamed then sobbed he was
babbling things but they were completely
unintelligible

  mcdall shuddered but he stayed where
he was crouched waiting there was
nothing else he could do he shifted his
position every once in a while to keep his
joints from aching and his circulation
from going away he kept his eyes on
the unfathomable ceremony of the ngani

-the ritual of which he understood

only one thing that it would end in cor-
puts death

  an agonizingly long time went by-

just how long though he didnt know he
had forgotten to check his watch at the
beginning he glanced at it now and it
was near midnight but that didnt mean
anything because he didnt remember what
time he had left the boat his bent knees
ached after a while and he had to sit
clasping his hands on his knees in his
mind he traced carefully every move he

would make in case what he expected
didnt happen the moment that the
ngani seemed ready to kill corput he
would have to draw his gun and run for-
ward crouched shooting as he came it
would be perfectly useless of course he
would kill a few of them perhaps one with
each of the ten bullets if he were lucky
then they would overwhelm him and
stretch him between two logs also and
the death that finally came would be as
nothing to the maddening dance and
chanting over his still live body   

  this was certain as anything could be
yet he knew he must make this attempt
to rescue corput no matter how hopeless
it might seem he must do that because
he was still a white man and that was
the white mans insanity

  as he sat there he realized that he had
been hearing the soft beat of other drums
for some moments faint in the distance
and with them a chant yo yo nutufya
ngani other drums   

  now the ngani had heard them the
line of dancers had stopped swaying wa-
zala had stopped waving the rattle in the
air he had stilled his unearthly calls he
was rising prying apart his slanted eye-
lids and staring in wonder

  the ngani drums ceased

  wazala stood tall commanding-but

perhaps a little afraid in this moment he
raised his arm then swung it in a slow
semicircle toward the river that was
where the other chant came from he
stood like that for another moment then
snatched his shield and spear from where
it leaned against the drying rack and
trotted off in that direction he called
and the line of dancers followed someone
gave a gurgling war chant and the rest
took it up giving it rhythm and form   

  the clearing was suddenly empty wait
-it seemed empty now that the danc-
ing warriors were no longer there but
there were still a few old men and women
moving about like bewildered ghosts
among the huts one hag had come to
the fire and was poking scattered burn-
ing sticks back into it corput groaned
at her and she spat in his face

  a voice called from the opposite end of
the clearing-a joke apparently for the
	jungle

old woman laughed as she looked in that
direction and replied and then mcdall
looked too and saw one of thetall ngani
warriors squatting holding spear and
shield in the crooks of his arms he had
obviously been left as a guard

  mcdall allowed himself the luxury of
one deep breath then he broke from the
concealment of the undergrowth and be-
gan to run across the clearing surprise
that was the thing he was depending on
surprise the old woman at the fire
looked up saw him and simply stood
there looking not comprehending he
kept running

a sharp cry came from the hut
where the guard squatted mcdall
hoped that it would not be heard out there
in the jungle by the other ngani he
hoped that they would be too far away
or perhaps too busy to hear it he kept
running paying no attention whatsoever
to the guard he would handle him when
and if some time in the next few seconds
the need to handle him became more ur-
gent right now he must get to corput

  he passed the fire circling slightly to
sidestep it he was at the drying rack
then near the line of drums there were
the two logs and taut between them cor-
puts blubbery form mcdall stared at
corput he saw watery eyes no longer
deep in the cheeks but bulging now he
saw fleshy lips tremble

  dont ask questions said mcdall
just follow me when i cut you loose the
ngani are out there in the jungle but
with luck we might miss -them as he
talked he drew the bush knife and slashed
at the rawhide bonds which held corputs
wrists and ankles the lecturer tried to
stagger to his feet and fell groaning with
pain

  the old hag started screaming sudden-
ly she pointed at mcdall and jabbered
mcdall saw the fallen rattle lying where
wazala had dropped it a worn thing of
feathers a gourd and an esese branch he
snatched it up and waved it at the woman
terror crossed her face and she began to
back away toward the huts

  movement touched the corner of his
eye he whirled and saw the guard com-

stories

ing toward him spear raised at first im-
pulse his hand trembled toward the auto-
matic pistol at his side and then he re-
membered that the ngani out there in the
jungle would surely hear the sound of the
shot even if they had missed the cry of
the guard and the screaming of the old
woman the bush knife was already in
his hand and he raised this instead and
with his other hand he turned the rattle
toward the guard shook it once

  the warrior was not as frightened of
the rattle as the old woman had been he
had the narrow face of the ngani and
eyes even more slitted than wazalas had
been three tiny ceremonial scars were
embossed on each of his cheeks and as
mcdall pointed the rattle he saw those
cheeks work in and out saw the wide
mouth part slightly no the warrior
wasnt afraid of the rattle in mcdalls
hand but it was still an implement of
juju a sacred and disconcerting thing
the warrier chose that moment to throw
his spear but he threw it hastily and with
a touch of desperation the spear passed
inches to one side of mcdall

  mcdall leaped forward he swung his
bush-knife saw the warriors shield of
crocodile skin come up to parry the blow
and he changed the direction of his swing
it cut deeply into the warriors other
shoulder he drew it back again and
chopped backhand the blade struck just
below the mans ear   

  mcdall staggered back feeling a little
sick the jungle swayed around the field
of his vision and he shook his head vici-
ously to knock the nausea from it he
turned and trotted back to where corput
had been corput was on his feet sway-
ing he took his arm roughly and made
him stumble across the clearing toward
the jungle

omehow- -in some unreal dream-
like way---he made corput move
along with him he cut his way through
the jungle no longer trying to be silent
and when he reached the trail that led to
the river he could only hope that there
would be no returning ngani upon it he
had to take the chance that they would
have another route perhaps one wider
the long fear



than this he was too exhausted to worry
about it or even to care very much any
more   

  he scarcely remembered reaching the
boat leaning on strong black arms and
then moving out on the broad flat river
when awareness of things came back fully
she was under the canvas in one of the
camp chairs and corput was seated on
the duck boards his head - in his fat
crossed arms he was sobbing and shud-
dering

  jobi the twisted one was standing be-
side mcdalls chair mcdall heard jobi
say ibwa wete joi ja nkakamwa death
is a strange thing he looked up and saw
that jobi was staring at corput

  mcdall leaned forward and touched the
fat mans shoulder corput he said
snap out of it its all right and you
can thank jobi for it he played that
thoki chant of yours on the recorder
and the ngani heard it thats what made
them break up their little party and go
looking through the jungle--

  corput looked up slowly it seemed

as though someone had opened a valve and
let all of the flesh out of his cheeks the
loose skin along his chin bone trembled
saliva glistened in one corner of his
mouth he opened his eyes wide smiled
foolishly at mcdall and then suddenly be-
gan to laugh he sat there rocking and
shaking and laughing without the faintest
trace of mirth

  in the towns mcdall had seen white
men with the long fear broken with fever
perpetual terror in their eyes it didnt
take long once it began   

  the blacks kept poling and the dark
river moved by corput stopped sobbing
and laughing after a while and just sat
there staring vacantly mcdall filled his
pipe perhaps the white mans medicine
would help corput when they reached co-
quilhatville he didnt know he knew
only that there was juju and that things
did move in mysterious ways but that
white and black men had different names
for it corput had called it logic

  mcdall lighted the pipe and dreamed of
the boat back to the states

   by james blish

    what ancient monsters would prowl jungle trails when
    terror unlocked the valley of dragons

kit kennedy stepped out of his
lodge onto the springy turf and
took a deep breath all around him
the baobab trees towered except directly
back of the lodge where the mountain be-
gan pearly morning light filtered
through the leaves and the deep rich
green of the loam over the sonorous
whispering of the nearby river there came
a chittering of monkeys and the sound of
a scampering game being played invisibly
high up among the leaves

  kit exhaled with a satisfied sigh here
in the deep gunda province it was cool
and clear most of the day the coast was
the steaming country where white men
wasted and died quickly yellow with qui-
nine and alcohol kit was a white man

but he had almost forgotten it-it had

been eleven years since he had seen kan-
sas that would seem like a foreign coun-
try to him now he was ktendi-the

other titles the natives had given him
didnt matter it was enough to belong to
the jungle

  the wind shifted slightly and kit felt
a delicate pulsing in his ears as if tiny
palms were pattering at his ear-drums he

stiffened sure enough-the jungle

telegraph was in operation somewhere
down by the luberfu a moment later
the thrumming became stronger as the
wassabi village picked up the message and
passed it on

  over kits head the foliage stirred and
a great flat head dipped down to regard
the white dweller kit looked up

  hello manalendi he said gravely
you hear them too eh

  the python shot out a forked tongue
with lightning quickness obviously the
huge beast was alert to sounds no human
could hear his head wove questioningly
kit grinned few men see anything but
menace in a great constrictor but to kit
manalendis overwhelming curiosity was


funny the creature had been hanging
around the lodge for nearly a year now
following kit wherever he went departing
only on brief trips to snitch a chicken from
the wassabi

  i wish you could tell me what you
hear kit said but you cant under-
stand the drum message so were even
there are white men coming here mana-
lendi and that means trouble

  the snake did not understand that
either but perhaps he didnt have to be
told that the drums often brought trouble

-if he were lucky interesting trouble

that would wind up in a fight manalendi
was not vicious and most of the jungle
creatures big enough to match him left
him strictly alone it was kit supposed
a dull life for the most part

  but the python was a hole card which
kit sometimes had reason to play no use
betraying it ahead of time he gave the
snake the one word-command which he
had been able to teach it

  upstairs handsome

  manalendi pulled in his tongue disgust-
edly and withdrew his dappled blue body
blending with the shifting leaves kit
looked speculatively at the drum which
hung its draw-strings flaccid from the
eaves of his lodge no if the matter were
urgent enough to arouse mtombu hed

already be on the way-the wassabi

tribes had heard the message before kit
had--

  the thought had barely entered kits
head when he saw the brawny body of the
black chieftain sprinting silently down the
trail toward the lodge kit raised his
hand in greeting

  long life mtombu

a thousand years mtombu said au-
tomatically then ktendi there is a
safari coming here a great one with many
guns and many boys they have whips
whips not just the sjambok
serpents fetish



  no bwana long plaited whips such as
white men use for horses already they
have had desertions the deserters claim
such cruelty as might frighten a belgian
this was one of mtombus rudimen-
tary jokes neither he nor ktendi
thought highly of the ostensible rulers of
the congo kit said whats it all about
why do the boys have to be driven-
doesnt the baas pay enough

  the pay is high mtombu returned
squatting down on the turf kit followed
with the natural grace of a man who had
long forgotten the crutch of chairs but
there are whispers

  there are always whispers these
people probably hope for gold most of
the whites know i pay for my shells with
raw ore--perhaps they have some silly
story about a hidden temple under my hut
--white men will believe anything
no bwana one can sense the gold-
fever it shows in the eyes and in the
smell of the sweat besides who would
disturb ktendis gold this is another
lust it is whispered that they seek the
valley of dragons

  kits lips whitened if it were not for
the bearers he said grimly one might
almost wish that they find it this is very
bad mtombu how came they to hear
of the valley do the deserters know
we are to blame ktendi

 how so

 when we found and slew mokele-
mbembe the great dragon last year the
whites you rescued brought the word out
they collected stories of tribesmen and
chiefs there was much excitement this
new safari seeks more mokele-mbembes
and their brothers

  kit nodded all in all he was not sur-
prised since he had yanked stahl and the
english girl almost out of the mouth of
mokele-mbembe he had been fearing some
such result-

  for mokele-mbembe had been a dino-
saur alive and thunderous the survival
of such monsters passed with only a shrug
among the blacks who knew no geology
and had long had legends of the snake-
headed lau the elephant-eater mokele-
mbembe and adozen other nightmares of

the swamps and forests-danger has a

million heads in africa to the european
world however which knew dinosaurs
only as faint traces in ancient rocks such
a discovery would come like an explosion

  kit had hoped that the lack of evidence
--for they had had to leave the scene

in a hurry--would have cast doubt on

any story stahl might tell but he realized
now that the hope had been only a phan-
tom stahl had been an important bureau-
crat though a uniquely courageous one
his word would bear weight in belgium
and paula-

the old bitter taste was in
kits mouth again the alum-and-lye
of his hatred for the whole white world
for a while he had thought that the
english girl would stick with him but
she couldnt take it her background over-
rode her she yearned for the sound of
nasal voices discussing things of no mo-
ment longed to be back in an english
drawing room where one might pat lions
and snakes on the head at a safe distance
of five thousand miles she had demand-
ed a poshi of mtombu and had left kits
lodge for the long haul to berghe-ste-
	jungle

marie and civilization with her she had
taken kits last twinge of sympathy for
the white mans world

  and paula had been some kind of nabob
on the english congo inquiry commis-
sion if she told the lords and ladies that
there were dinosaurs ranging the congo
swamps they would say my dear girl
but theyd believe her now there was a
safari looking for the valley of dragons

-looking for it in the old familiar

european way with whips

  mtombu was watching kit steadily
i have sent an advance party to ambush
these seekers he said a war-arrow
will help desertions and we can attack the

rest at any time after that- the

big bantu did not bother to finish the
sentence but his gesture showed what he
planned for the whites

  kit shook his head this safari is
probably official he said if we break
it up it will give the whites every excuse
for a punitive attack-soldiers whip-
pings burnings of villages all the old ter-
ror

  but if they find the valley ktemdi
they will be here by the hundreds

  i know kit said rising they will
turn the country into a reservation over-
night-or worse they will stampede the

great beasts out of the valley and turn
the whole province into a death-trap we
had best see nmnota at once

  the black stared at kit for a moment
then he said nmnota hates you

ktendi-and juju is a weak reed

against whips and guns-

  mtombu whips and guns impress
you overmuch and i have no intention of
using nmnotas kind of juju quickly

now-we have little time

  mtombu went down the trail without
further question kit at his heels behind
them manalendi the long one rustled the
leaves but when kit turned to look for
him the python was not in sight the
realization gave him a chill manalendi
had at long last deserted them and there
was little doubt where he was headed

  manalendi was seeking out the valley
of dragons where the ancients of his
tribe churned the swamps fought titanic-
ally or plucked the white fruits from the

stories

lianas and thought of things which had
happened before there was such a creature
as man   

tn the hut of nmnota there was a
peculiar ineradicable stench com-
pounded of smoke blood scorched flesh

and a variety of aromatic herbs-the

smell of the fetish also it was dark but
not dark enough to conceal the fat ugli-
ness of nmnota

  kit had few enemies but witch-doctors
seldom loved him that juju existed was
a matter kit did not doubt but in his ex-
perience few of the local devil-dancers
knew any more about it than the rest of
the natives they were simply parasites
preying upon the fears of their fellows
kit had had deadly curses placed upon
him by more of these leeches than he could
remember and had survived without any
more effort than a shrug required there
was an old man to the southwest now
who might make a bad enemy   

  the tubby sorcerer bent a black look
upon mtombu thine omens are evil
great chief he said sonorously this
day i have read thy fate in the entrails of
a pure-white rooster thou bringest thy
people to bad ends with overmuch heark-
ening to strangers

  there are  messages writ in such
messes mtombu said using the infin-
itely insulting dju a grammatical con-
struction ordinarily reserved for animals
and children thy chicken bespeaks thine
own jealousy ktendi is no stranger to
any but thyself leave off thy prattling
and be silent there is mans work afoot
nmnota grumbled but subsided
mtombu was his chief if you speak
of the government safari nmnota was
warned by the spirits long ere this

  kit stepped forward now that the
tribal business was settled he could take
part without breaching courtesy then
perhaps nmnota can advise ktendi
who must learn what little he knows from
the drums did the spirits happen to re-
port that the safari sought the valley of
dragons 

  judging by the way nmnotas eyes
bulged the spirits hadnt thought that as-
pect of the matter important enough to
serpents fetish



mention but the wizard made a quick re-
covery let them seek he said if
they should find it there will be nothing
left for the wassabi to clean up

  nmnota dissembles kit said his
people fear the valley and with reason
it is not good that the whites should vio-
late it more this country is virtually

unknown to the whites-it belongs to

us if the whites find the valley the
gundu lands will be overrun with them
before two years have passed-expedi-
tions will come by the handfuls to snare
the great beasts settlements will go up
there will be shooting and trampling of
corn and spoilage of women and property
if this safari is destroyed by the great
reptiles others will be sent bigger and
stronger ones until the valley is con-
quered

  ktendi has forbidden that the was-
sabi attack this safari nmnota said
soon it will be known that he fears only
for his own safety and his fine words
mean only that his brothers might take
his gold the wassabi need not gold
they will protect their own kraals and
will know ktendis cravements for what
it is i have spoken enough

  as have i kit said rising he stared
down at the plump charlatan i will not
have these whites here inevitably they
will consult nmnota since they will think
he knows better than we others where the
valley might be nmnota will keep his
own counsel or ktendi will see him sent
naked into the valley is it not so
mtombu

  it is so the warrior said there was
no love lost between the wizard and
mtombu for among the wassabi as
among all congo peoples the witch-doctor
and the chief were constant rivals for
power nmnota spat disgustedly into the
dust but offered no further comment the
two went out into the sunlight leaving
him glumly regarding his bare toes

  you will keep a close eye on the tribe
mtombu kit asked in french

  yes bwana but i cannot promise si-
lence of nmnota he has long sought to
return us to our old cannibal customs and
our law that whites must be killed on
sight this affair will give him fuel and

tinder among our people

  i understand that i must leave it in
your hands i have other spears to harden
in the south remember that it is import-
ant to head off any attack upon the sa-
fari-silence and stealth are our only

hopes

  the big bantu nodded life bwana

  a thousand years

  kit strode toward the thorn gate a

thousand years-it was a long time the

equivalent of eternity for men but now
they had to deal with creatures who had
been in africa a minimum of thirty million
years the blacks had no word for mil-
lion for they had never seen that many
things alike well the whites had the
word but they did not know the jungle

  the jungle had been around for a long
time too and there were no words for
some of the things it hid   

t the beginning of the second
days travel kit took to the trees
the drums throbbed incessantly keeping
the jungle informed of the movements of
the safari and their sound was becoming
angry and warlike ktendi hath forbid-
den that these whites be molested yet they

seek the valley of dragons-the whites

approach-ktendi hath forbidden--

they are daily closer to the valley-

  kit kept moving south and west
roughly in the direction of lake leopold
iii by nightfall the drums were very dim
and no new hides picked up their mes-
sages here what was urgent to the gun-
du tribes was matter of no moment the
land which was the land of king lgon-
delu granted no allegiance to ktendi or
to the whites

  kit waited until the jungle was blanket-
ed in blackness and crept toward the boma
within which lgondelu slept he waited
until the cooking fires died and the mur-
muring of voices dwindled and became
blended with the whispering of the jungle

  then he lifted his head and screamed

  it was a long thin rasping wail-a

sound that should not have come from
the throat of a man or better still should
never have been sounded at all it was
the scream of a panther

  again kit waited through most of
	jungle

the village he knew bantu women would
be huddling their infants closer and black
warriors crouching tensely inside the
woven mats which were the doors of their
huts that scream must have emptied the
alleys and the big compound in a hurry

  and in one hut a very old man would
be waiting as kit was waiting   

  kit found the hut without difficulty and
scrabbled at the reed mat whining like a
curious cat a quavering voice said wel-
come

  it was pitch black inside and there was
no odor but the smell of earth and a faint
musty tang that suggested age the quav-
ering voice said it is ktendi this
matter of the valley is very serious then
deadly kit said otherwise i would
not trouble you old one

  i know that ktendi knows of the
limits of my power within those limits
i may help not beyond what would he
have me do	

  kit sat down and said tensely i am
unable to order any attack on these whites
yet they cannot be allowed to reach the
valley my desire that the safari be un-
molested will quickly make my people sus-
pect me they may not do the important
thing i must ask of them when the time
comes to ask it there is only one way
speak

  lgondelu hates you but he fears
more than he hates it is widely known
that you are a true sorcerer and no leech
it must be said here in the village that
ktendi has deserted his people for the
whites and that the tribe of mtombu is
weak and frightened

  the old voice said lgondelu will
make war on mtombu if this is said
even so this is what i wish within
two days the people of lgondelu must
go north painted and armed to war upon
mtombu the drums must cry war with
great voices lgondelu will ask omens
of you say him nay he will be sure to
go if you prophesy defeat kit paused
but the old man said nothing kit said
this will be true prophecy that you may
make in all good faith

  the word that ktendi has betrayed
mtombu will reach mtombu

  no matter mtombu will not believe

stories

it nmnota will which will be for the
best but there is more there must be
magic this ktendi cannot make

  i make small magics speak

  kit took a deep breath there must
be a large magic there must be light-
nings in the valley of serpents there

must be lightnings-and fire

  for a long time it was silent in the
dark hut for the first time since he had
come to live in the jungle kit felt a ner-
vous urge to make some useless motion-
pull at his earlobe shift his feet anything
to relieve the tension if he had asked

too much-

  that is great magic the old man said
would ktendi drive the monsters from
their home  this must not be the jungle
would be very terrible if these serpents
were abroad in it the whites would drive
them out but we must not

  we must kit said his voice deepen-
ing with conviction we must do more
we must drive the monsters directly over
the camp of the whites and then----we
must drive them back into the valley
again look you my friend we can
bring no force to bear on the whites our-
selves or we shall feel the whips on our
backs before the year is out and the gun-
du country will ring with gunfire our
sole hope is to convince the safari that the
great reptiles have been driven out of their
valley and are scattered all over the face
of africa there is no way to do that
but to do it and-of course the mon-
sters must be driven back to the valley
again

  and ktendi means to muster the
people of lgondelu and of mtombu at
the rim of the fire to herd the beasts to
the valley again-with the threat of war
between the two tribes

  yes kit said the flying things will
return of their own accord when the fire
is over but the thunderers who walk must
be herded it will take us all to get them
back and there is no way but war to
bring us together can the lightnings be
asked this favor

  once more there was a long silence
then the old man said the jungle is
dry but the season of rains is moons
away i will ask the favor ktendi--
serpents fetish



but it is a large magic for an old man
if i am refused there will be slaughter
between the tribes and the whites will
reach the valley all the same

  and ktendi kit said wryly will
go in the pot my people have not for-
gotten the crisp crackle of long-pig for all
that they have not tasted it since i came
to them it would be fitting that they
broke my law with me

  i will ask that there be fire in the val-
ley of dragons the old voice said and
a south wind to fan it but this is a very
large magic for an old man ktendi
kit stood up i would not ask it he
said soberly of any other

two days and dusk again and the
trees purring with an invisible river
of wind kit paused in the -crotch of a
shea tree and listened the safari had
last been reported travelling the ikatta
and he knew that it would have to leave
that swampy river before getting very
deep into gundu country

  a distant sound fought upwind sing-
ing for a moment kit would not believe
it he wriggled higher in the tree and
lay still along a thick corded branch so
the bearers still had spirit enough to sing
it didnt jibe with the stories of whippings

and desertions-

  the deep bass voices drew nearer and
after a while kit could make out the lan-
guage and then the words

    i die in the desert a thing
      accursed

    that saw thee yet never pos-
      sessed thee   

  no such song had ever been sung be-
fore in the congo for there were no des-
erts in the belgian protectorate only a
very few patches of grassy veldt in the
northern highlands kit racked his mem-
ory the dialect was very strange

  after a moment he had the answer

upper kenya-that was desert land

and the language fitted the deserters
then had been the local boys these ken-
ya bearers could be expected to stick with
the whites the valley of dragons would
be only a name to them

  that was bad there was both money

-jungle-winter

and brains behind this raid on the jungles
oldest secret

  the rhythmic crashing of machetes had
barely reached kits ears when it was cut
off there was shouting and a vicious
crack which almost made him wince the
headmen had whips all right and no re-
luctance to use them a gleam of orange
showed that fires were being lit and camp
made for the night

  kit slithered forward grasped the tough
lianas and went hand over hand to the
next tree from here he could see the en-
campment almost directly below him a
tent was being pegged out and before it
three white men stood arguing in subdued
voices one of them held the whip
doubled under his arm off to one side
an incredibly thin tall negro was patient-
ly having his back taped by another white
-evidently the victim of the whip get-
ting a doctors attention the black con-
firmed kits guess the man was obviously
a turkana a member of that small con-
flictless tribe which ranged the boundaries
of the kenya colony

  one of the white men raised his voice
angrily youre a fool he said shrilly in
french theyll take it from one of their
own kind but from a white man they
wont havent we lost enough bearers

  i know what im doing the man with
the whip growled france is full of nig-
gers if you allow them an inch they
take an ell

  the doctor finished and gave the tall
turkana a slap on the shoulder he went
off surlily and the fourth white man
joined the group at least he said
try to take it a little easy des grieux
a welt is one thing that doesnt cripple
but if you lose your temper and flay the
man hell be useless for weeks maybe for
good

  all right the one called des grieux
said in a sour voice but im tiring of all
this malingering listen to those damned
drums by the time we find the valley at
this rate the whole countryll be up in
arms

  those arent war drums the fourth
man said just the usual information
bureau if you hear the war-call youll
have whipped it into being
	jungle

  kit decided that it was time he took a
hand in this conversation swinging his
light boots over the edge of the branch
he slid away and dropped

  the men were still arguing when he
struck and the matted grasses took up
most of the sound of his landing the
little doctor started visibly when he
turned in kits direction

 what-whos that

  the others spun kit kept his thumbs
in his belt even in the dusk it was plain
to see that he carried no rifle or spear
he said good evening

  my goodness the doctor said gasp-
ing a white man--what a turn you
gave me did you spring up out of the
ground man

  no matter kit said ive had word
of your safari ive some advice for you
if youre interested

  hardly des grieux growled the one
called dunstan put a hand on his arm

  just a minute i think i know this
man he looked kit over carefully
unless im sadly mistaken we have here
the legendary ktendi-son of wis-
dom king of the wassabi master of
serpents and half a million other titles
or are you just a stray hunter

  im kit kennedy kit said called
ktendi by the wassabi

  and what of it  des grieux demand-
ed im not interested in operatic heroes
state your business msieu and get back

to your savages-weve no time to nurse

strangers

  i dont need nursing thank you im
here on your behalf this is dangerous
country youre entering id advise you to
turn back

  is that a threat

  not at all you are in no danger yet
but the blacks fear juju more than they
do guns the valley of dragons is held
in great dread by all the gundu tribes if
you persist in searching for it youll have
a full-fledged revolt on your hands

  des grieux sniffed a real excuse to
come in and civilize this morass id say
youre a white man you dont believe
this kind of story whats your own in-
terest in the valley

  personal

stories

  naturally what is it

  dunstan said as the story goes this
mans an american whos taken to jungle
living maybe he doesnt want us tres-
passing on his territory that right mr
kennedy 

  partially

  his territory des grieux lawghed
harshly strode forward and shoved his
face to within six inches of kits lis-
ten msieu this is the kings territory
we have no regard for savages no mat-
ter what their color im a hard-headed
man--hard enough to believe the unbe-
lievable when the evidence is good there
are dinosaurs here i want drawings and
specimens i mean to get them if the
niggers fear magic more than guns that
is a very sad error on their part do you
understand me

  kit calmly took des grieux nose be-
tween steel-hard fingers and brought the
astonished man to his knees with a merci-
less wrench des grieux tried to grab at
his legs and the whip fell to the ground
kit put a foot on it and flung the man
away from him

  your manners he said need im-
proving i dont like people who puff in
my face he scooped up the whip des
grieux scrambled to his feet raging but
if he had any intention of charging kit
the sight of the lash changed his mind

  kits eyes flicked over the guarded
faces of the white men in the brief si-
lence a pounding of drums came through
dunstan stiffened

  thats it he said softly were iri
it now thats a war drum or ive never
heard one

  the wild throbbing came from the
north where the lands of mtombu lay
kit cocked his head

  ktendi hath betrayed the folk of
mtombu ktendi hath given the gun-
du lands to lgondelu ktendi hath
promised the valley to the whites

ktendi hath betrayed--

  and then

  spears to the south or death spears
to the south

  take warning gentlemen kit said
softly the blacks war among themselves
only the valley of dragons is tabu if
serpents fetish



you turn back now you will be safe-

otherwise youll die the valley is not a
cozy zoo it is a place where old and hor-
rible things still live things that your
world cannot meet things that we know
better than you if you fight your way

through the tribes to the valley-you

wish you hadnt

  as the last word left kits lips there
was a flutter of movement over his head
and three tough massive strands of cold
power lashed about his waist tightened
lifted-

  manalendi

  the foliage closed about him below
the four faces looked after him white as
milk

the fires dwindled behind them
and blinked out kit clung rigidly
to the pythons body for a moment then
hit it twice with his fist the coils loosed
him delicately and kit crawled free and
swung away below there was a sudden
hysterical shouting and then a volley of
shots through the tree they had just quit
whipping the leaves like heavy rain

  kit kept moving only when he was
sure that the camp would not be able to
hit him from where it lay did he stop and
catch his breath the python glided to a
stop near his head

  youre a melodramatic old sinner kit
murmured what was the big idea any-
how 

  the snake moved uneasily the sound
of kits voice seemed to disturb it

  whats the matter fighting some-
where 

  tsss manalendi said he began to
slide away kit waited curiously until the
snake came back and drove a horny snout
between his shoulder blades nearly knock-
ing him sprawling from the branch kit
clutched at the vines and caught in a
mouthful of air

  all right ill come along dont be so
damned persuasive

  tssssss the snake said nudging him
urgently and began to travel again kit
clambered after him as fast as he could
the war drums boomed implacably the
very air seemed to shudder it was very
dark after a while kit worked his way

up to the top of a giant baobab to get a
look at the stars manalendi travelled in
a broad impatient spiral of steel around
him shaking the branches gently

  were going the wrong way kit mut-
tered and its clouding up look
handsome damned if ill stop to steal you
a chicken at this stage of the game youll
get me lost and ive got business-oof

  the snakes huge head had thudded in-
to his ribs again kit decided to call a
moratorium on his plans pythons norm-
ally slept between meals-usually two

weeks at a time but manalendi had
something extraordinary on his cold little
mind tonight that was certain

  a distant flicker caught kits eye for
a moment he thought he had imagined it
then it came again a chill went up kits
backbone it was several months too early
for the rainy season but that flash could
be only one thing an old man in lgon-
clelus kraal had asked certain powers a
favor-and had gotten it

  kit clambered down and began to work
south again after a few moments the
snake followed kit was afraid it would
be disposed to interfere but this time it
made no protest

  he skirted the camp listening wryly to
the sounds of frightened preparation that
the drums were stirring up in it and
backtracked the safari it seemed several
hours later that he came upon the spoor
of a large war party but the stars were
now completely overcast and it might have
taken less time already kit was begin-
ning to wonder if the night would ever
end

  the party when he reached it was still
on the move they were going south
therefore probably mtombus people

not that it made much difference-kit

knew that neither side would be exactly
glad to see him now he passed on over
them without making any sign

  a dim haze of yellow and pink was
glowing on the far dark horizon whis-
pers moved the air above the tree-tops the
flight of thousands of small dark bodies
some of them were birds kit was glad
he could not see the others

  the valley was on fire

  kit pressed forward the encampment
	jungle

of lgondelu was not hard to find the
warriors had lit fires kit descended and
walked straight into it even a fallen king
he thought wryly has a little prestige left
-one can never tell when he might re-
gain his throne besides manalendi was

following him-a spectacle to give the

most bloodthirsty enemy a sober second
thought

  lgondelu came to meet him tall and
horrible in paint and feathers his greet-
ing was very simple he said go 
three syllables in swahilli and three times
as unfriendly

  i have grave news kit said without
giving any sign that he had heard
mtombus party is near

  lgondelu gestured imperiously with
his spear a black nearly as tall as him-
self stepped to his side make ready
lgondelu said the wassabi approach
then to kit again go you are not wel-
come here

  that is not the only word i bring
kit said evenly it is now far too late to
make war upon the wassabi do you
not hear the jungle

  lgondelu lifted his head the jungle
was rustling while he listened a small
vivid green snake shot through the dust
at his feet and vanished again leaving a
zig-zag trail

  the small ones first kit said softly
then the big constrictors like mana-
lendi here the birds have already gone

over and then-

  the chiefs eyes bulged with realization
fire he said hoarsely ktendi hath
fired the jungle

  the fire is far from ktendi kit
said it began beyond the villages of the

wassabi it is-

  a medley of triumphant howls drowned
him out the brush shook and erupted
black men lgondelus warriors snatched
up their spears

  the wassabi lgondelu cried he
brushed past kit arrows began to thrum
from the trees around the clearing on
the north side men were already down
shields thudded against each other

  at the same instant the trees were
swarming with screaming monkeys push-
ing at each other biting jumping wildly

stories

from branch to branch dropping like the
ripe baobab-gourds that bore their name
the din was terrible but above it a
greater sound came rolling in a rising
clamor of terror and death the warriors
hesitated turned from each other to look
up

  a herd of antelope stampeded through
the undergrowth on hooves as light as
the footfalls of spirits the glow on the
sky was plainly visible now the roaring
and howling became still louder and kit
thought he could hear the faint crackling
of the flames themselves behind it

  the black men forgot their war the
trees lgondelu screamed the ranks
melted like clods in a flood making for
the thick trunks--

  but it was already too late there was
terror up there among the leaves a
black and sinuous thing looked down at
them from the nearest crotch its eyes
glowing green fury lgondelu stabbed
at it and it answered with a sound like
the death-agonies of a devil it was mad
with fright and hatred and sprang upon
the instant the sabers of its claws spread
wide

  man and cat hit the ground simul-
taneously but the cat did not stop to fight
it fled a bolt of black lightning in the
tossing branches more pairs of green slits
flashed down the men ilid back down
the trunks again in a hurry

  mtombu kit shouted

  here the wassabi chieftain al-
most unrecognizable in his war paint
gestured from the other side of the clear-
ing but made no move to come closer
if he had his own men would have put
a spear in his back

  the valley has been burned out
kit said at the top of his voice even
in the din he was sure every black could
hear him the great beasts are com-
ing this way they must be driven back

  for an instant the shock froze them all
the sky was bright enough to cast faint
shadows the ground shook with the pas-
sage of heavy bodies somewhere nearby
hippos probably

  then slowly mtombu approached
with him came two or three others and
lgondelu is this your doing ktendi
serpents fetish



mtombu said somberly

  no matter this disposes of the
whites the monsters will go right over
their camp they will be lucky if they
live and will report that the great beasts
have been scattered beyond hope of cap-
ture but-they must not stay scat-

ered

  both chieftains nodded it went with-
out question penned in the valley the
great reptiles lived out their lives with-
out impinging upon the rest of the jungle
folk but roaming abroad-

  i have three hundred men lgondelu
said

  mtombu grinned mirthlessly so
many it is well this war was stopped
i have half that many ktendi is it
enough 

  it will have to be fan out the
forest folk will not molest you unless
you try to halt them let them by kit
moistened a finger the fire seemed to be
moving a little to the east of them un-
der the urging of a steady inexplicably
cold wind herd the monsters around
to the west-it will be impossible to make
them go back into the blaze

  there was a new thunder agitating the
trees like the pebbles in a witch-doctors
rattle the night rang with the trumpet-
ing of elephants

  it began to rain it was impossible but
it was so

  on the yellow-lit loam things came
lumbering branches snapped with their
approach the first one came through a
thirty-foot horror with a wide-fanged
head blundering like a kangaroo upon
its hind legs for an instant kit froze
his muscles congealed with panic then
the thing moved forward and kit forced
himself to shout at it it stopped and
glittering mindless eyes looked down at
the puny figure with the brand

  brand fire the thing was stupid
however terrible after a while its wal-
nut-sized brain turned it aside and sent
it loping away toward the west

  there were more the world became an
enless nightmare there were four-legged
monsters twice the size of hippos with
ridges of flat spear-blades along their

spines screaming eighty-foot nightmares
with necks and tails as long as manalendi
legs like tree-trunks bodies that would
dwarf a bull elephant

  there were wide scarlet maws lash-
ing tails that bore batteries of spikes
great turtle-like carapaces grasping
webbed paws with pointed horny thumbs
pads that mashed five inches into the
loam at every step above bat-shapes
wheeled in the columns of rain things
eighteen feet from wing-tip to wing-tip
and called to each other hoarsely eagerly

  and there were things for which no
words existed things older than words
older than the walking apes who had
invented words-

  the men were johnny - come - latelies
but they had spears and arrows and fire
also they had brains

  something stirred under the overhang-
ing lip of the cliff a huge heavy head
wove up and looked at them bowstrings
twanged and a black flight of arrows
whined around the thing it hissed and
lumbered away into the valley

  thats the last kit said his smoke-
roughened throat rasping too bad we
had to kill so many but the jackels will
clean them up anybody got a brand left

  there were several one was passed
from hand to hand until it reached kit
he took it and went forward into the
pass looking up at the great overhang
feeling a sick regret for what must be
done

  the three little white sticks slipped
neatly into the crevice kit wound the fuses
together lit the longest one and ran at
the count of eight he threw himself on his
face

  the blast sent fragments of rock and
burned wood whoo-whooing wildly
through the mist the overhang tottered
then majestically it came down and an
avalanche of rubble came after it the
rain beat the dust down

  a leathery flapping went over their
heads nobody watched it it went over
the brim of the sealed pass and was gone
it would never come out again

  nothing would ever again come out
of the valley of dragons
tomtom tragedy

by wilton hazzard

the great war drym of the makua tribe had been silent for many moons
when suddenly it moaning rhythm beat across the kraal corby knew that
juju death was flying like an arrow to his heart

the river gleamed like polished
jade tangled lianas streamed out
from walls of jungle into the broad
slow current ripples of green slime
turned up by the high prows of the
canoes folded back on themselves and were
still occasionally a gossamer of butter-
flies caught in the rays of the setting sun
hovered over the heads j of the canoe-boys
like a multi-colored veil floating in a
breeze

  a tall makua of classic physique stood
in the bow of the foremost of the three
canoes shielding his eyes against the glare
of the sun just as it sank into the green
depths of the river he pointed ahead and
shouted

  mahango bwana

 mahango-mahango

  the crews of the following canoes re-
peated his shout then a lively chant was
started breaking the brooding silence the
canoe boys rose to one knee and drove
their paddles into the green slime the
bowman began to beat time with two
halves of a coconut shell the canoe
lurched from side to side and there was
a wild joyous play of muscles as the crews
raced for an out jutting bend in the river
spray from the flying paddles slapped into
gordon corbys face as he crawled from
under the rattan shelter amidships

  mahango was situated a few miles east
of the triangle formed by the gazaland-
transvaal-rhodesian border at the con-
fluence of the limpopo and muanetsi riv-
ers it was therefore a strategically placed
factory and the most westerly post under
the companhia de mocambique

  as the companys senior agent it was
corbys job to inspect the isolated fac-
tories and to see to it that the petty black
despots who held sway along the banks



of the great jungle waterway kept the
treaties they had made with the chartered
company

  trouble shooting along the limpopo
was apt to be more than a mere figure
of speech in corbys day portuguese con-
trol of the remote districts was more nomi-
nal than effective the makuas were still
restless after the revolt under gungun-
hana or as many thought corby among
them under the real leadership of the
zanzibar arab sef mejid gungunhanas
viser whose grasping ambition had reached
out for the whole of gazaland and whose
cowardly desertion in the hour of crisis
had brought war and death to the
makuas

  corby himself had taken a spear-thrust
from the doughty makua war chief when
at long last he had been brought to bay
and had died as he had lived killing
men with the utmost enthusiasm his
great war drum had been silent now for
ten years but not the tongues that ex-
tolled him he died to the long grief of
his tribe a truly great man the makuas
said so brave and of such infallible power
that a mans name drummed out by him
flew to the heart of its owner as swift as
an arrow and lo the man was dead

  mahango stood upon an eminence in a
clearing about a mile from the south bank
of the river as the canoes swept around
the bend the thatched roofs of the wattle
and daube huts showed above the green
like the peaked straw hats of chinese
peasants the cargo sheds stood at the
far end of the stockaded compound the
factors white-painted bungalow in the
centre the flag of portugal drooped from
the head of the tall staff that stood in
front of it

  as the canoes slanted shoreward cor-
bys attention became fixed on the flag
all was not well at mahango or it would
have been hauled down at sunset it was
a ritual religiously performed wherever
the white mans fetish flies far from his
homeland

  the canoe boys saw and felt the signs
of ill-omen without a word of command
they rested their paddles and began to
talk among themselves in soft whispers
where were the storeboys who were wont
to come down to meet them and the girls
with their provocative swaying hips and
mocking laughter it was an evil thing for
men to come to the end of a long trek
and to be greeted by even less than
the bark of a dog aie only the be-

witched or the dead could be so silent

c orby uttered a sharp command
the paddlers started again but
with evident reluctance the under-brush
had been cleared from the bank a wide
path led up the slope from the cleared
space and faded into the misty green
corby was the first ashore while his crew
beached the heavy dug-out he walked up
the path for a short distance rifle in hand
then stopped and looked up the trail

  as the last canoe drove its nose into
the soft ooze of the bank corbys head-
man wearing a red fez khaki shorts and
a tunic that showed a row of greasy battle
ribbons leaped out and ran up the path


	jungle

  mahri hanna or maryanne as corby-
called him -was a somal in the prime of
his manhood and he was as punctilious
as an hidalgo upon what touched his own
and his masters honor he had served
with corby against gungunhana and
according him his merit corby had raised
his status to that of a companion-in-
arms

   weve got trouble said corby as the
somal came to stand beside him those
canoe boys are scared for one thing and
if you dont watch em theyll shove off
and leave us stranded

  who knows what has happened here
sar it would be folly to go up to the
factory alone

  corby grinned the same thought
occurred to me just now said he and
the surest way to keep the boys is to take
them with us get them moving mary-
anne 

  shouting and flicking his cane mary-
anne marshalled the thirty odd boys and
started them up the trail corby placed
himself at the head of the column mary-
anne remained at the rear to assist the
too reluctant with his cane

  night came as they made their way up
the slope of the hill a brilliant moon
silvered the path and the mist that came
with the chill of night hung in shreds
among the trees the drone of insects
flowed into the silent spaces and the weird
cry of the kunha bird began to sound
down the scale the trail broadened as
it debouched from a rustling grove of
banana trees and approached the gates
of the deserted silent compound

  suddenly a hoarse voice coming from
the bungalow that faced the open gates
broke out into song

  oh bring my terung die ou

  transvaal-

  the ret was drowned out by the
startled yells of the canoe boys as they
stampeded back down the trail corby
took a deep breath of relief piet der-
voorts people had deserted him but evi-
dently the young boer was still very much
alive a good man was dervoort corby
thought of a hard-riding straight-
shooting breed there was always trouble
somewhere along the river but it was

stories

uncommon when dervoort couldnt keep
his boys he strode up the moonlight
path a spurt of flame flared on the ver-
anda of the bungalow a bullet fanned
corbys cheek he flung himself down on
the path and rolled out of the line of
fire swearing fluently

  maryanne came racing up the trail
corby waved him down

  its dervoort said he as the other
crawled up to him he must be blind
drunk or he wouldnt have missed me
ho piet he bellowed nee skeit its
corby

he was answered by a wild whoop
then dervoort came running and
stumbling down the path tattered pants
flapping about his legs corby rose to
meet him

  alamagtag the young fellow stood
swaying on his feet and peered at corby
with blood-shot eyes i took you for a
damned spook wat dink jy- he broke
off laughing hysterically then fear
leaped into his eyes and he clamped his
hand over his bearded mouth while his
body shook as he stifled his mad laughter
suddenly he threw his arms about corby
and sobbed like a woman

  how long have you been alone piet
a month perhaps-i cannot tell it
was the drum-always at sunset it started
it sounds hollow like a voice from a tomb
alamagtag my boys went mad with fear
i tell you

  did you hear it tonight piet

  no no cried the boy wildly i am
not sick it is not an ordinary drum-i
know drums was i not born among the
zulus you did not hear it because it has
done its work it called my boys away
called each by name i tell you

  sure it did said corby soothingly
his makua canoe boys were coming back
up the trail urged to it by maryannes
cane several of them were staring at
dervoort with big curious eyes corby
took dervoorts arm and walked him to-
ward the bungalow lest his wild appear-
ance and excited gestures communicate
ihis fear to the gaping makuas

  the familiar odor of palm oil and
dried fish coming from the shed greeted
tom-tom

corby as he approached the bunga-
low a row of empty gin bottles
stood in a neat line along the rail o
the veranda dervoorts rifle lay on the
floor there was an open box of cartridges
near it and the brass of empty cases
gleamed on the floor it was the old
story-a very old one for corby almost
conventional in its details a white
agent deserted isolated and feeling the
jungle closing in on him like a palpable
mass-fear fed by imagination until every
sound and object was magnified and dis-
torted usually the victim afraid to sleep
at night kept a vigil upon his veranda
blazing away at shadows it could end in
one of two ways the poor devil went
crazy and shot himself or he got drunk
and stayed that way until corby came
and sent him down river for -a rest while
he remained behind to root out the trouble
and get trade started again

  while maryanne herded the makuas
into their quarters and barred the gates
of the compound corby with the toler-
ance that comes of understanding drank
with dervoort the truth was that there
was a softness under corbys hard ex-
terior he took a paternal interest in the
well-being of the young agents that came
under his charge if they measuredup to
what he thought was desirable in a good
one and it was pleasant to drink with
a man whose corpse at this very mo-
ment might be buried under the red
earth of the compound he nodded sym-
pathetically as dervoort babbled incoher-
ently about the drum and witchcraft and
when the boer slid from his chair he
picked him up and tucked him into his
bamboo cot

  on the following morning dervoort
was up before corby he was on the ver-
anda when corby came out for coffee
clean and fresh-looking and apparently
none the worse for the nights debauch

  senhor said he diffidently in portu-
guese i think we should drag the canoes
up to the compound also we should di-
vide the night into two watches you to
take one myself the other

  eh corby was startled why the
devil should we do that

  because if we do not there will be

tragedy	

no makuas and no canoes in the morn-
ing senhor

  well ill be damned-the drum eh
piet well dont worry about it the
kind of experience youve just been
through can leave a man with very vivid
impressions

  dervoort colored i do not imagine
things said he and i will bet a months
pay that you hear the drum tonight

  ill take your money corby laughed
and just to put your mind at rest ill
have maryanne lock the boys in their
quarters tonight

  good enough dervoort grinned at
him boyishly and went off to start the
days work

  later corby sauntered through the
sheds he found everything in good or-
der the heat in the cargo shed was
heavy with the sour nutty smell of palm
oil native and dried fish he noted with
satisfaction the number of tins filled with
the orange-colored oil and the neat casks
the work of dervoorts coopers piled high
in tiers ready for shipment despite deser-
tion dervoort would show a better rec-
ord for the year than any other man along
the river he left the shed with a thought-
ful look in his eyes dervoort had lost
none of his grip on things and he wasnt
the type to be troubled by too vivid an
imagination

  just before sunset dervoort and corby
came out on the veranda neither of the
men spoke dervoort stood with his gaze
fixed on a gap in the trees through which
a strip of the river could be seen gleam-
ing like burnished tin the opposite bank
was a green fringe against the sky bril-
liantly blue shading into a band of purple
where distance blurred the outline of a
range of mountains with half-closed eyes
corby studied the boers good-looking 
profile noted the tenseness of his pose
the supple grace of his young body a
makua was standing by the pole waiting
for the signal to lower the flag maryanne
came to report all secure for the night
corby jerked his thumb at the bottle that
stood on a table at his elbow and mary-
anne poured himself a brimmer

  just as he lifted the glass to his lips the
drum spoke its tone did sound hollow
	jungle

and yet each note was distinct thrice the
call was repeated the booming notes
hovered over the tree-tops and died in
the limitless silence of the jungle at the
precise moment of sunset then every-
thing was as still as death not a leaf or
a twig stirred

  the crash of shattered glass broke the
spell liquor slopped over corbys shoes
he turned to stare into the somals bulg-
ing eyes his own face twisted into a grim-
ace of astonishment maryannes lips
moved but no words came

  gungunhanas drum said corby

maryanne burst into his native
speech it called thy name mas-
ter even as it did long ago when we
marched against him and he challenged
you to battle oh we know that the
makuas say in their hearts gungunhana
will return it must be so else how could
this thing be

  gungunhana is dead said corby
sharply he held out his big hand is
this not the hand that slew him you
talk like a wizard 

  but maryanne knew his privilege and
was disposed to speak his mind no good
could come of his masters fine contempt
for the wisdom of the forest people and
it troubled his loyal heart how was it
that one so wise could not understand
that the soul of an enemy slain might
take up its abode in the body of another
man or in that of a jungle beast the bet-
ter to wreck its vengeance

  bwana he began drums cannot
speak with the same voice no more than

people can-

  thats true maryanne

  its also true that no makua would
dare to beat the drum of a chief so power-
ful as gungunhana-

  ha dervoort who had been watch-
ing corbys face interposed with the tri-
umphant note of the vindicated wat dink
jy daarvan

  what did he think of it  corby looked
out arcoss the river whence the sound had
come what should a man think when a
drum silent for ten years boomed out a
challenge from the grave according to
his emotional bias he supposed just as

stories

it was natural for maryanne and der-
voort who had some zulu blood in his
veins to think of witchcraft it was natural
for him to think in terms of flesh and
blood from the effect to the cause

  a man who is not a makua is beating
that drum said he fact is piet the
drum has stopped trading at your post and
its our job to stop the drum i want-
he broke off and jumped to his feet with
an oath the makua who had been stand-
ing by the flag-pole had disappeared the
subdued babble of voices came from the
native quarters gradually increasing in
volume until it became a confused roar

  come on corby shouted and iaulted
the veranda rail theyre going to make
a break for it

  he raced across the compound with
maryanne and dervoort at his heels they
had covered half the distance to the gates
when the makuas burst from their quar-
ters and streamed out in a black flood the
three were caught in the mad screaming
panic and swept on toward the gates cor-
bys head bobbed above the mass like a
white float in a stream while he roared
and struck out to right and left then the
tide reached the gates crashed them and
swept on down to the river

  corby picked himself up from the path
gasping for breath and spitting out dirt
he felt as if a steam roller had passed
over him dervoort ran up to him his
automatic in his hand

  put it away snapped corby a dead
porters no damn good to anybody
wheres maryanne

  the somal came staggering up the path
wiping blood from a gash in his cheek

  maku dogs he spat disgustedly
they have taken the canoes sar
well corby squinted at dervoort
ill listen to you next time piet any-
way we couldnt have got any work out
of those fellows theyd have sat around
all day babbling about gungunhanas
ghost theres a village a few miles down
river well try to get another gang
there

  dervoort gave him a puzzled look

but the drum-

  to hell with the drum corby ex-
ploded the drummer not the drum is
tom-tom

our trouble piet im going to start look-
ing for him right now man or ghost
nobody can scare the wits out of my boys
--stop trade inmy territory

  as he turned to walk up the path der-
voort started after him with his mouth
open to protest but maryanne caught his
arm

  it cannot be otherwise sar said the
somal gravely the drum has called him
you know it must be obeyed

  the devil but that is not what he
thinks

  does it matter what he thinks sar 
the drum calls we go we will come to
the same place by different roads

  alamagtag yes but i think death is
the end of this road maryanne

  it is here at mahango too sar if
we try to leave it will catch us on the
river and we will die like cowards

  you will follow him into the jungle
maryanne 

  oh yes sar he is never so far from
me that i could not reach out my hand
nd touch him

  dervoort rubbed his chin thoughtfully
then suddenly he laughed good enough
when the predikant caught me making
love to his daughter back home he said
i was ripe for hells fire and a preacher
cannot lie

they started for the village two
hours before sunrise and marched
for a while under the dripping of the dew-
laden trees they followed one of the
game trails that threaded the forest the
river was hidden by a dense screen of
bush but its noise was audible a soft
gurgling over-tone to the throaty grunts
of beasts and the cackling of birds dis-
turbed by the passage of men a troop
of monkeys flitted across their path like
grey shadows the old dogs that formed
the rear guard scolded and showed their
teeth as the sun climbed burning shafts
of light pierced the gloom miasma reek-
ing with the droppings of water beasts
rose from the black mud wallows and the
trail ahead faded into soaking mist but
soon the mist cleared the heat became
oppressive and the three rested in a pool
of sunshine easing their rifles and heavy

tragedy	

packs from their shoulders while the steam
rose from their damp clothing

  whats your explanation for the drum
piet corby asked suddenly

  alamagtag does it need one i tell
you i would feel better if we were trek-
king the other way

  afraid of spooks piet

  it is not the same thing i have never
seen a spook but i have seen much that
i cannot explain witchcraft may be
trickery and superstition as you say but
i have seen men die of it and if trick-
ery kills aman what good does it do him
to know it

  thats true enough witchcraft is a
weapon in-this country and a dangerous
one but youll admit that the wizard kills
by poison not by magic

  i do not admit it say now if you are 
killed today or tomorrow would the ma-
kuas be wrong if they said the drum
called him and he could not stay  

  corby knocked the ashes from his pipe
and rose were out after the drummer
because its our job to keep trade moving
in these parts piet said he with a scowl
besides theres damn little else we can
do until we get canoes and boys to paddle
them

  truly muttered dervoort as mary-
anne helped him to shoulder his pack
there is nothing we can do the wizards
have turned their trick

  by noon the red flare of dying banana
fronds were showing among the green
indicating the proximity of a village it
was a small village of several sorry-look-
ing huts clustered about a palaver house
there was no broadening of the trail that
approached it and no man came out to
greet them which was an insult if it was
not indicative of open hostility

  the devil swore dervoort and un-
slung his rifle we might be lepers

  we are worse said maryanne look-
ing gloomily at the deserted hut they
know a ju-ju curse is upon us put up
your rifle sar no man will hinder us
keep your rifle handy and keep mov-
ing  corby barked at him

  aware that eyes were watching them
from behind the screen of bush corby
led the way through the center of the vil-
	jungle

lage expecting to hear the whizz of dead-
ly poisoned arrows with every pace but
they reached the river unmolested there
were several canoes drawn up on the
muddy bank worm-eaten battered relics
for the most part maryanne chose one
that looked as if it might stay afloat

  luckily the river was only about two
hundred yards across at this point the
current slow and the water as tranquil as
that of a pool to the south its channel
was visible for about a mile to the north
the channel was straight for several miles
until it was lost in a void of shimmering
green where it made its westward turn
below mahango

before they were half way across
dark figures began to show on the
trail behind and the village drum com-
menced to throb soon it was answered
by others up and down the river and
deep in the jungle corby swore softly
under his breath evidently his move-
ments were being broadcast and-he

didnt doubt it-some makua wizard

with more daring and originality than his
black-hearted brethren was building up a
reputation for himself at the expense of

what gordon corby valued most-his

prestige no white man in gazaland was
treated with more diffidence by the ma-
kuas than he was that was due to an
accident of war to the fact that the butt
of his rifle had felled gungunhana but
he had come to think of it as his due
nevertheless it was prestige that made
his work possible and his work was his
life

  though nothing of it showed on his
hard lined face corby was thoroughly
roused and he was worried he knew that
dervoort had stated the native viewpoint
correctly if anything happened to him
the makuas would say that gungunhanas
ghost had called him to account the odd
thing was that he was compelled to answer
the call he couldnt ignore it if the
damned drum wasnt stopped it would
break him it was just that--the cal-
culated cleverness of the thing that wor-
ried him somewhere he had an un-
known enemy one whose intelligence was
above witchcraft

stories

  they found a path on the opposite bank
and followed it until they could see the
flag-pole at mahango on the hill above the
trees corby called a halt

  its about sunset said he well get
our direction from the drum

  dervoort nodded and maryanne started
a fire for the evening meal

  again at the exact moment of sunset
the call reverberated over the jungle in
spite of himself corby felt the hair on his
spine bristle it was the silence that fol-
lowed it that would get under a mans
skin in time but the jungle was always
silent for a brief moment at sunset he
wondered if it was coincidence or a con-
scious striving for psychological effect

  about ten miles north-east observed
dervoort

  thats where i figured it would be
corby agreed its not generally known
but there is a valley back there called
umakosini the burial place of chiefs
alamagtag breathed dervoort and
stared at him

 corby chuckled and answered the
others unspoken question

  youre right piet they say gungun-
hana is buried there but im not asking
you to go along youll stay here with
maryanne if im not back by this time
tomorrow start down-river dyou un-
derstand maryanne

  oh yes sar

  and you dervoort

  yes sar said the boer and spat
after he had eaten and rested corby
started up the trail the soft leaf mould
of the forest cushioned his feet when
he had covered a couple of hundred yards
he looked back dervoort and maryanne
were on the trail behind him a warm
light came into his eyes he waited for
them and then without exchanging a
word the three trudged on

  now the path followed a shallow stream
that gurgled over a sandy bottom the
night was full of whirring and cacklings
the underbrush thinned and patches of
starlit sky began to appear in the leafy
canopy overhead and presently an early
moon climbed above the trees and dappled
the path with silver and shadow the
subdued beat of a drum sounded in the
tom-tom

distance a wooded bluff loomed ahead
the stream led them to a deep ravine
they entered it in single file moving
swiftly and silently with the damp live
smell of fertile loam rising from under
their feet

  after they covered another hundred
yards a hiss from maryanne at the rear
brought them to an abrupt tense halt they
stood motionless

  what is it whispered corby

  the somal motioned him to silence and
pointed corby looked back along the
trail pools of moonlight made it visible
for many yards until it vanished into
shadowy perspective at first he was
aware of no movement then he saw black
shadows flit across his line of vision and
the flash of light on metal

  it is a trap this kloof said dervoort
calmly there will be more of them
ahead of us

  corby wiped the sweat from his face as
he said slowly well- the fellow thats
beating that drum has got more on his
mind than killing us just yet i think

  you think he wants you alive 

  ive got it figured that way corby
murmured

  dervoort did not answer for a moment
but stood looking up the trail ahead his
handsome face set in hard lines

  shoot it out with them said dervoort
a makua and a zulu is the same thing

i have seen men die slowly look he
broke off pointing

a stalwart makua had come
out of the shadow a few yards in
advance of them he was an induna a
proud stem-visaged commander of a reg-
iment a metal ring symbolic of his rank
gleamed around his bull neok and another
ring crowned his white woolly head he
was unarmed and he extended cupped
hands in formal greeting

  i know you bwana sadari said he

  corby looked into the grim face and
smiled

  do i look upon sala who was senior
captain among the makuas

  even so but i come in peace sa-
dari

  i see that you are unarmed sala but

tragedy	

i	saw spears behind me and doubtless
there are spears behind you

  think no evil of that sadari my
master sent me thither to wait for you
and now that you have come i must take
you to him

  who is this master warrior 

 ha you will know him when you
see him bwana sadari if you come with
many he bade me to drive them if you
come with few he bade me to bring you
to his house in peace he has words for
you

  i too have words for him sala let
it be as your master says show us the
way warrior

  the induna turned and stalked up the
trail as the three followed there was a
faint rustling of leaves on either side of
them and corby guessed that they were
flanked by unseen warriors moving
through the bush parallel to their line of
march

  an hours march brought them to a
right-angled turn in the ravine a gorge
opened before them closed in by high
walls of black rock the ground was
sandy underfoot and fairly clear of bush
the gorge was manifestly the ancient bed
of a river perhaps the limpopo itself
the stream they had followed meandered
between huge boulders rounded and
smooth the sound of drums increased
in volume

  this must be it said corby we
are the first white men to enter the burial
place of chiefs piet

  the young boer smiled wryly if we
are not first white men to be buried among
them i will go home and marry the predi-
kants daughter even that i swear it
maryanne crowded corby he looked
about him while he clutched in his hand
the charm he wore about his neck un-
intelligible words came from his moving

lips-muttered incantations to appease

the great shades

  suddenly sala halted and raised his
hand a terrible cry rang through the
gorge corby turned in time to see the
makua warriors burst from the cover of
the bush behind them he fired from the
hip into the black mass dervoorts rifle
exploded at the same instant then the
	jungle

makuas were upon them and they were in
the center of howling black chaos for
a time they stood their ground fighting
back to back with clubbed rifles but
grasping hands clawed them apart corby
saw maryanne and dervoort go down and
he roared like a wounded beast his heavy
boot cracked the skull of a makua that
clung to his leg his rifle had been tom
from his grasp and blacks clung to his
arms like limpets a jolt from his knee
freed his right arm and his big fist
smashed into a snarling face with his
gun hand free his automatic began to spit
death and space opened around him a
knob-kerry whizzed and thudded between
his shoulders he staggered and went
down at last under a mass of stinking
sweating bodies

  swiftly the makuas bound him hand
and foot a slender pole was passed
through loops at his feet and shoulders
amongyells of triumph he was lifted like
a slaughtered beast and borne away

  face down and with his head bobbing
a foot above the ground the dust that rose
from under the splay feet of his bearers
choked him by the time they had cov-
ered a mile he was conscious only of the
agony in his muscles which were drawn
with every swing and jolt as if he were
being racked

  the dust had blinded him but the
frenzied clamor of drums savage yells
the bedlam that came suddenly to swirl
around him told him that they had ar-
rived at a village the swaying stopped
his head struck the ground and the stench
of mould and dung filled his nostrils he
waited until there was silence near him
then rolled over on his back great tears
streamed down his lined face as he opened
his eyes and some of the grit was washed
from them

  a stifled boer oath and a groan sound-
ed close to him dervoort maryanne
he called the somal by name dervoort
answered him in a choked voice

  they left him back there-dead

  corby began a mad struggle with the
bonds about his arms and legs the hut
was filled with his gasps and groans until
bathed in sweat he lay exhausted and
sank into a kind of coma

stories

the sound of men talking outside
the hut awakened him pencils of
sunlight pierced the noisesome blackness
the rattan door of the hut was open light
and air streamed and was blotted out again
as two makuas crawled in one bent over
corby the other over dervoort steel
flashing in their hands the bonds about
corbys legs were slashed cramped and
unable to stand they were dragged out
into the sunlight where they were allowed
to kick until the life came back into their
limbs a dozen makuas stood in a circle
around them leaning on their spears jab-
bering and laughing corby saw a few of
his own boys among them and got some
consolation from their glum looks they
at least were not enjoying their bwanas
humiliation then the two whites were
heaved up onto their feet and marched
along a path between two rows of huts
that looked fresh and new

  at the far end of the path there was a
bungalow raised on a foundation of piled
stones its extended eaves supported by
four poles shaded a wide stoop a heap
of dried mud bundles of raffia and sap-
lings recently slashed attested the new-
ness of the structure

  as they approached it two figures came
out on the veranda one wore a white tur-
ban with a fringed knot over his left ear
and his obesity was made prominent by
his loose white robe and the green cum-
merbund around his belly the other was
a woman tall and full-breasted at the
distance of twenty paces she looked like a
white woman but as they came to stand
at the foot of the veranda steps corby
saw arab blood in the olive sheen of her
skin bared by her white sleeveless abaiyia
and in her black flashing eyes a golden-
haired marmoset at the end of a length of
silver chain attached to her wrist sat on
her naked shoulder with his prehensile tail
coiled around her neck the grotesque
little creature grimaced at them and bared
its teeth

  alamagtag whispered dervoort
she is something to look at

  but corbys eyes were fixed on the fat
arabs face it was a flabby black-and-
white mottled face with sagging jowls like
the dewlaps of a hound a close-cropped
tom-tom

grey beard only half concealed full lips
and a mouth of discolored teeth

  i see that you have not forgotten me
bwana sadari said the arab in a high
sibilant voice i have prayed that we two
should meet again behold my prayer is

answered-it is the will of allah

  no i have not forgotten you saf me-

jid-it were easier to forget the devil

corby retorted and truly the will of
allah is beyond all understanding or sure-
ly he would have answered the prayers of
better men and sent you to hell long since
tc await me there

  mejids belly shook with silent mirth
doubtless all will be answered said he
we shall meet there again in the end
but now it is a matter of precedence it
is fitting that bwana sadari should go be-
fore me i have so arrangedit-in sha

allah then his yellow-flecked eyes
glowed with venom he jerked his head
toward the girl this is nanan her

mother was french-

  corby turned curious eyes upon the girl
she stood looking at dervoort with a faint
smile on her full lips as if pleased by the
frank admiration she saw in the young
boers eyes corby had heard of mejids
french wife some said he had stolen

her others- mejids voice recalled

him

  -she was my great happiness un-
til you came to gungunhanas kraal with
soldiers and drove us forth into the wil-
derness she died of hunger and thirst
the last words were spoken with pe-
culiar emphasis and corby felt the chill of
them in the pit of his stomach

 she took her death at your own
hands mejid said he calmly you
preached war and when it came you ran
like a coward and left brave men to pay
for your folly with their lives

  mejids hand flew to the hilt of the
kumia thrust into his sash no more
words he shouted i did not call you
here to palaver no you have come to
judgment and to death as i knew you
would when i called you on the drum
because you are as vain of glory as other
men yes you will die but not quickly
he pointed to a large hut that stood at
the edge of the clearing there is your

tragedy	

prison it is comfortable and its walls are
strong you will live there unbound for
as long as life seems good to you he
broke off his eyes gloating then went on

  every day my servants will bring you
fresh food and water sadari but one day
your food or your water will be poisoned
-which day who knows perhaps to-
morrow  perhaps when the moon has
waned when hunger groans in your
belly when thirst burns as fire in your

throat-ah then think of the poison

sadari and think of me men say you
are fearless he sneered but i think
that you will cling to life allah grant
that it may be long i have-

he broke off with a startled yell
that mingled with a scream from the
girl like something shot from a catapult
dervoort had bounded up the three steps
his lowered head struck mejid full in the
stomach they crashed to the floor to-
gether dervoort kicked savagely at the
arabs head two makuas flung them-
selves upon him and pinned him down
surprised by the unexpectedness of the
attack corby was thrown down before he
had moved

  mejid was helped to his feet take
them away he gasped

  sef mejid lounged on his veranda at
sunset on the following day he savored
the cool breeze and sucked his long-
stemmed narghile contentedly occasion-
ally his gaze turned toward the hut at the
edge of the clearing before the heavy
barred door by which two armed men
stood guard and as often as he did so he
laughed softly

  oh yes it was a pleasant thing and

by allah it was a shrewd thing-to

avenge himself and to establish his au-
thority over the makuas at one stroke
with what patience and cunning he had
planned it no white man could trace the

deed to him when the two were dead-

of poison or starvation- it mattered not

there would be no marks of violence-

he would have their bodies  carried back
to mahango nothing would be disturbed
months would pass before the portuguese
infidels came to look for them by that
time the ants and vermin would have fin-
	jungle

ished the work who could say how they
had died

  wallai el adhim it was a flawless thing
of beauty already the makuas believed
that the soul of gungunhana had entered
his body and spoke through his mouth
as if a shensi could have a soul--but
allah keep them in the darkness of the
unbelieving soon he would be the bwana
sadari lord of the river even the great
company would pay for peace the hongo
he would impose on their caravans

  it is an evil thing you do my father
a soft voice broke in on his thoughts
startled he turned to scowl at his daugh-
ter she moved gracefully across the ver-
anda and sat at his feet the marmoset
jumped from her shoulder and tugged at
his chain striving to reach the fruit that
lay on a table at mejids elbow

  is it an evil thing to avenge your
mother girl he asked

  were the words of this man bwana
sadari true she answered him with a
question

  he lied i was ill with fever my ser-
vants bore me away against my will is
the word of a stranger and an infidel more
to you than a fathers

  a troubled look came into the girls eyes
she shook her head as she said but the

other-he is young he could not have

been your enemy what wrong has he
done 

  allah give me patience it is not what
he has done girl but what he might do
he has a tongue to tell a tale with

  the girls black eyes flashed that is
the evil you do and my heart tells me
that it is not for the love of my mother
that you do it he is young and brave-
ah the young one so there a hot
wind blows mejid patted her shoulder
put him out of your mind girl soon
better men and richer will look upon you
vith desire

  is your heart fixed upon this thing
my father

  wallai it is go leave me girl

  for a moment she watched her pets
frantic efforts to get at the fruit her ex-
pression enigmatical then she picked up
the whimpering little monkey and went
into the house

stories

t t qw long is it now dervoort

  	looked up at corby and wiped the
sweat from his face it was night and a
band of moonlight struck down through
the smoke-vent in the high roof lighting
the interior of the hut dimly

  three thousand by my count said
corby

  then it is not tonight dervoort took
up the gourd of water that stood on the
floor between them and drank greedily
but it may be in the food eh alamag-
tag what a way to live a mouthful of

water then count the seconds-have you

no nerves he almost shouted at corby
his hands trembled

  corbys big hands clenched and drove
the nails into his palm for the first time
he knew fear not the natural healthy fear
that clings to life but the kind that seeks
death he insisted on tasting the food and
water first not because he hoped that der-
voort might live but because he was afraid
to see him die

  dervoort jumped to his feet suddenly
i can stand no more of it he cried
there is no hope for us it will not be
tomorrow or the next day that fiend
out of hell will keep us alive until the
thing drives us mad he caught corbys
arm in a hard grip let us rush the
guards when they come in next my friend
a spear-thrust is quick

  corby shook his head they wouldnt
kill us piet give it another day maybe
well think of something

  the young man looked into his face and
suddenly smiled i am not a fool said
he i know how it is with you but i am
here because i did not obey your orders
to go down river it is not your fault i
would do it again he pointed to the
earthen pot filled with a savory mess of
rice mutton and greens we will eat to-
gether tonight my friend and when-

what the devil

  he broke off as nanans marmoset
scampered between their legs its silver
chain jingling behind the pet went
straight to the earthen pot and clung to
its rim fascinated the two watched the
little beast stuff rice into its mouth like a
grotesque caricature of a greedy old man
then corby uttered an exclamation and
tom-tom tragedy



grabbed the chain there was a string
around the marmosets neck and attached
to it almost hidden by the long hair was
a small cylinder of paper with the bad
temper of the pampered the marmoset bit
his finger as he detached the paper

  dont let him get away corby sucked
his bleeding finger as he went to the shaft
of light and opening the paper puzzled
over the arabic characters well ill be
damned he said at last listen to this
piet he read

   i looked upon thy youth and beauty
  and pity kindled a flame in my heart

  i give you my pet i have kept him
  in hunger when he dies know that
  the servants of my father whom
  shaitan has made mad will come for
  you i know well that thy courage is
  equal to what lies before thee may
  the mercy of allah be thy shield his
  wisdom by council farewell 

  piet heres a woman who knows her
mind and speaks it

  that is a rare thing i tell you said
dervoort wonderingly but to whom does

she speak it-and what the devil is the

meaning of it

  well she wouldnt be talking to me
piet id say its plain enough she liked
the look of you and shes sent her monkey
to taste your food the girls got brains
she figures if we know just when were
supposed to die weve got a fighting
chance by thunder thats it corby
lapsed into silence and the furrows on his
face deepened with thought

  alamagtag look dervoorts voice
broke the silence

  the marmoset was rolling on the floor
the two men exchanged glances as the
animal began to whimper piteously

it was tonight -breathed dervoort
corby stripped off his jacket threw it
over the tiny creature and smothered it
he looked up at dervoort theres a
chance if you want to take it piet

  the light of hope was in dervoorts eyes
and he laughed less than a chance is
good enough for us my friend already
we should be as dead as the monkey

-jungle-winter

  a few moments groans and cries of
mortal agony came from the hut the two
makua guards squatting before a fire that
burned close to the hut sprang to their
feet and stared at each other their rolling
eyes showing white in the darkness they
waited until all was quiet within then
one picked up a burning brand from the
fire lifted the bars from the heavy wood-
en door and entered the hut the flicker-
ing light of his torch showed two figures
stretched out on the floor the makua
shuddered as he looked into the face of
one whose teeth were bared in a horrible
grimace of death he called to his com-
panion 

  the big one is too heavy said the
other guard as he entered and looked
about him nervously i will go-aie-e
he started to yell as one of the figures
rose and sprang at him corbys big hand
caught him by the throat and the life was
quickly throttled out of him corby got
to his feet the embers of the torch glowed
on the floor the hut was filled with
heavy breathing

   piet he called softly

  verdomp skelm dervoort rose out
of the darkness rubbing his throat for
a moment i was not sure whether it was
to be me or him

  armed with their dead guards spears
they went out into soft moonlight an
orange light showed in one of the win-
dows of the bungalow jackals were howl-
ing close to the clearing goats and sheep
bleated nervously ini the near-by huts and
the lowing of cattle and the shouts of
herdsmen came from the thorn-bush boma
evidently prowlers had attacked the stock
and the men of the village had been called
out to drive them off

  this is luck said corby

  the devil you say dervoort an-
swered with his reckless laugh it is the
shield of this allah my friend

swiftly they made their way across
the open space to the bungalow der-
voort circled around the rear corby cau-
tiously mounted the steps to the veranda
the murmur of voices came from the rear
of the house a screen of mosquito net
was all that barred entrance corby ripped
	jungle

it with the point of his spear and went in
light streamed from a curtained doorway
dimly lighting the passage that ran the
length of the bungalow suddenly a cry
followed by a thud echoed through the
house

  musto mejids voice called from be-
hind the curtain

  corby waited tensely with his back
against the wall

  musto what is it boards creaked
under heavy footfalls the curtains part-
ed and sef mejid came out into the pass-
age corby stepped in front of him his
spear flashed and drove at the pit of the
arabs stomach but stopped with the point
denting the mass of flesh

  merciful allah gasped mejid his
eyes bulging

 another word and youre a dead
man hissed corby and backed him
against the wall

  dervoort came out into the passage fol-
lowed by the girl nanan one said
dervoort the others are at the boma

  the girls eyes were fixed on corbys
face

  i will not kill him lady said corby
reading the question in her eyes if he
obeys

  mejids fat body quivered his dewlaps
showed green and white and sweat oozed
from his pores i will do as you say
he piped

 are you the drummer demanded
corby

  mejid nodded who else a shensi
would not dare to beat gungunhanasi
drum

  where is it

  in the gorge the burial place of
chiefs sadari

  good well go there if we meet
with anyone on the road you will tell
them to go away corby increased the
pressure on the point of his spear

  merciful allah yes

  good march

  one moment the girls voice de-
tained them she beckoned to dervoort
and he followed her through the curtained
doorway

  it seemed to corby that they were gone
for a long time he called softly they

stories

came out carrying rifles and cartridge
belts dervoort looked guilty

  did you have to pick a lock asked
corby sarcastically

  dervoort grinned no it was freely
given my friend this one is clever she
discovered that it would be tonight and
she put bait meat down by the boma
they will be busy for the rest of the night

i tell you-

  come on growled corby or you
wont live long enough to make a fool of
yourself

  they left by the rear door there was
a cultivated patch of ground between the
house and the bush corby spurred mejid
to a run they gained the cover of the
forest then circled around the clearing
and came out on the trail half a mile be-
yond the village

  as the moon rose above the kopjie they
came to the gorge dervoort who had
been lagging behind with the girl fell into
step beside corby 

  this thing does not seem as good to
me now as when we planned it said he
with a scowl

  corby stopped dead in his tracks and
caught the young boer by the shoulder
youll do what youre told piet said
he with an oath if you follow me this
time ill shoot take that girl and trek
for the river now

  dervoortsmouth set stubbornly i can
see how a message on the drum will lay
gungunhanas ghost yes it will stop the
war talk along the river but i do not see
how you are going to get away from sala
and the makuas back there

  hell exploded corby ive told you
according to mejid he hasnt got more
than twenty of his own men that means
the rest are your own boys and mine ill
swing em over to me all right all ive
got to worry about is sala and if i cant
handle him then i cant handle my job on
this river now get to hell out of here
yes sar dervoort beckoned to the
girl and they started off down the trail
toward the river corby watched them un-
til the white of the girls robe was lost ini
the gloom

  he gave mejid a prod with the barrel
of his rifle
tom-tom

  move fast you bag of wind and cor-
ruption he ordered

they crossed the gorge to its oppo-
site wall mejid led the way up a
steep narrow trail they came to a cave
the mouth of which was screened by flow-
ering vines that fell over the cliff like a
curtain of scarlet and green close to the
entrance stood gutigunhanas drum it
was a hollowed log trimmed to an oval
shape its ends plugged with softer wood
the slot measured about the span of a
hand at the wide end or male voice taper-
ing to a mere slit at the narrow end the
female voice worn splintered drum-
sticks lay beside it

  the cave was not deep corbys nostrils
quivered evidently it was -the lair of
jungle cats not long departed the air was
heavy with their fetid stench sef mejid
sat on the drum breathing heavily and
wiping the sweat from his face with the
wide sleeve of his robe

  gungunhana is not buried here cor-
by stated rather than questioned

  who knows where he is buried me-
jid wheezed i brought the drum here
and it was you who started the story
that this was gungunhanas grave

  even so when the war came i fled
to the mountains with my women and a
few servants he shook his head dole-
fully it was a hard life it seemed good
to return but it was many years before i
saw the way

  corby looked at him curiously what
were you trying to do build up a new
cult make a fetish of the drum and your-
self the high priest

  for a moment the spirit that long ago
had made him all but master of gazaland
burned behind mejids eyes he drew
himself up

  but for you and treachery in my own
house- the light faded in his eyes and
he slumped back on the drum it is the
will of allah

  sudden anger twisted corbys face into
an ugly grimace maryanne was dead and
but for the promptings of a womans heart
and wits he and dervoort would have
died in agony the first sacrificial victims
to a new superstition he wanted to give

tragedy	

dervoort and the girl time to reach the
river before the village was roused by
the drum he waited for half an hour
then

  all right mejid get started you will
say that bwana sadari has palavered with
the spirit of gungunhana we are very
good friends understand say that gun-
gunhana bids sadaris servants who de-
serted him to return to his service there
is peace between gungunhana and sadari
there is peace on the river now go to
work

  sef mejid rose and stood posed for a
moment like a virtuoso about to strike
the opening chord of a symphony then
the great drum boomed crashes of sound
filled the cave and rolled out across the
jungle as from a great sounding trumpet
drumming was an art passed on from
father to son and sef miejid was its mas-
ter fascinated corby watched the sticks
flying in his sensitive hands the arabs
eyes were glazed and sweat streamed from
his fat quivering face as he forced rhythm
and space to speak his mind there were
pauses and rippling notes like the sound
of the river cascading over the rocks sud-
denly mejid stood tense while the end of
his message floated over the tree-tops in
dying echoes

  then out of the silence came an answer-
ing call-tak-tak-boom-tak-a-tak-boom-

  mejid flung the sticks from him it is
done said he

  corby went to the mouth of the cave
and looked out across the gorge drums
sounded faintly in the distance relaying
the message down river and presently
the village drum began to beat out an
alarm corby turned come on mejid
come on said he

  where the arabs jowls quivered

  back to the village

  no whimpered mejid merciful
allah sala will know that i have tricked
him he was gungunhanas captain he
will kill me

  corby smiled grimly at least mejids
fear made it clear that he had drummed
out the right message

  in sha allah said he and there was
bitter mockery in his tone stay or try
to make it to the river as you will
		jungle

  when corby reached the village the
makuas were holding a big palaver they
sat in a circle in the cleared space before
mejids bungalow the induna sala stood
in the center haranguing them he wore
the plumes of a chief and shook his spear
he stopped abruptly and stood with his
mouth open as he caught sight of corby
walking up the moonlit path

  there was a rustle of movement and
excited jabbering as corby elbowed his
way into the circle

  let me hear your lies sala said he
coldly

the indunas eyes flashed
beware white man said he in-
solently else i silence thy tongue aie
i would do so but perchance i see now
things that were hidden from me before
he swept out his arm in a grand gesture
these are my people i am their chief
let bwana sadari say that it is so and i
will let him go in peace i have spoken i

  sweat trickled down corbys spine he
wished he could see what was going oni
behind his back sala was offering him
a way out but it was not in his nature to
accept it compromise and prestige didnt
mix in a matter of seconds hed be a
dead man or bwana sadari master of the
river

  sala said he sternly once before
you offered me peace but you attacked me
and killed my servant my answer is this
his hand shot out and plucked the plume
from the astonished indunas head and
flung them to the ground a shocked cry
burst from the makuas sala snarled and
faded back for a few paces like a boxer
his spear flashed upwards

  corby stood his ground his rifle still
resting in the crook of his arm a look
of consternation came to salas face it
seemed to corby that his eyes were fixed
on a point beyond him but he dared not
turn his head slowly the spear was low-
ered corby took a pace forward and
struck the spear from salas hand then
offering up a silent prayer of thanksgiving
he turned to look around the circle of
black faces until his eyes came to rest on
his own boys who sat in a group apart

stories

one by one they stood up as his eyes
singled them out he called them by name

  let the bwana dervoort men stand
said he

  when they were all lined up he looked
them over and shook his head what is
to be done with such children as you he
asked shall i send you back to your
kraals and take dondi boys in your
place

a wail of protest came from the ma-
kuas the dondi were their hated rivals

  but i must punish you to desert a
white bwana is an evil thing you will
work for five days for nothing i have
spoken march

   as the last of the column filed past him
corby was startled to see a figure in a
white shirt come sliding down the roof of
the nearest hut he swore volubly as
dervoort walked up to him grinning

  that was a good thing to watch said
the boer but dont try it again my
friend

  how long have you been up there-
wheres the woman

  after you left the cave i was never
more than twenty paces from you

  why the devil didnt you show your-
self

  dervoort laughed and patted the butt
of his rifle it was enough that sala
saw this said he did you think your
ugly face frightened him my friend
blast you piet youve got no re-
spect for a mans ego

  back at mahango corby sat on the
veranda of the bungalow dervoort and
the girl sat close together talking in whis-
pers

  just before sunset it came throbbing
from across the river as silence crept
back to the surrounding jungle his new
head-man came running across the com-
pound and up onto the veranda

  bwana whispered the black his voice
hoarse with excitement sef mejid is
dead sala has killed him

  corby nodded and touched the head-
mans shoulder there must be no loud
talk of this thing go now

  as the light failed and the flag came
down corby bent his head
 lost safari

by alexander wallace

veteran guide ross bain wanted to keep his record clean so he led that
party of strange scientists through twisted unknown jungle trails-even
though he knew the prize they sought was his own dead body

the sleighs safari was
camped on the river about a mile be-
low massa kessi or macequece as
the portuguese called the little african
town the rest house a thatched bungalow
perched on iron-wood stilts stood in the
centre of the clearing overlooking the river
now silvered by the light of an early moon
the flat space behind the bungalow was oc-
cupied by several small tents and a big
square khaki-colored mess-tent before
which sleighs swahili porters sat croon-
ing to the accompaniment of a bamboo
flute more pitiful than the wailing of an
abandoned infant

  emerging from the shadows of the jun-
gle trail ross bain paused to take in the
scene sleigh looked like money he con-
cluded and a white-hunter who owed his
headman a couple of months wages had
no right to be fastidious in the choice of his
clients it was just the fact that chemly
had recommended him to sleigh that made
him hesitate he couldnt understand why
chemly had done it there was something
queer about it a knife slipped between
his ribs in a dark alley was the more likely
thing for him to expect from chemly but
here was sleigh-a naturalist wanting to
work the revue river as far south as
bometelas kraal and then north to the
rhodesian border not just another big-
game hunter out for trophies and glory
he was an event or his sister was noth-
ing like her could happen again

  ross smiled quizzically as he strode
toward the bungalow the devil take
chemly a man had to make the best of
his opportunities

  a cane chair creaked as he mounted the
veranda steps and a white-clad figure rose
from the shadow

  ah glad to see you bain sleigh
shook hands with him affably just in
time for drinks he was a tall man with

and uncommonly large head a ruff of gray-
ing hair and pale blue eyes one side of
his face was paralyzed so that when he
smiled the corner of his mouth slid up
toward his left ear ross found it hard
to reconcile his boney ugliness with the
shapely provocative loveliness of his sis-
ter it was one of those jokes of nature
he supposed

  well said sleigh dryly i hope this
visit means that my sister has convinced
you bain

  ross flushed in the darkness said he
id like to make it clear that i turned you
down at first because of chemly frankly
id sooner have a recommendation from
the devil we had a little trouble not long

  i know sleigh interposed bit of
a bounder isnt he

  ross smiled wryly-typical british un-
derstatement that chemly was a remit-
tance man and as vicious as a cobra hed
been the terror of macequece before the


	jungle

commandant with ross acting as bouncer
had urged him to move on

  i know the family sleigh went on
damned awkward for them-theres a
title yknow we met him at beria on our
way in i knew hed been up here for a
few years and asked for a few pointers
he said you were a yankee-well you
know how he talks he said you didnt
have enough brains to be dishonest but
you knew this country as well as he knew
the inside of a bawdy house coming
from chemly i thought that was high
praise and looked you up

  ross laughed thats dear old chemly
all right well ill admit to knowing the
country if youre ready to start id
like-

  what sort of country is it mr bain

both men rose as jennifer sleigh
came out onto the veranda she was
blonde tall and very shapely in her jodh-
purs and white silk sweater there was
about her an exuberance an emanation of
physical nature in hardy flower ross
leaned back against the veranda rail silent
for a moment savoring the strong flavor
of her presence

  its good country he said presently
not much fever too high for it take a
chunk of territory-say about twice the
size of your own sussex-clothe it with
jungle honeycombed by streams that run
through the green bush like veins in a great
leaf people it with a dozen tribes of ma-
kuasproud zulu stock and you have por-
tuguese manicaland

  makuas said sleigh with a frown i
know you chaps prefer your own men but
i want to take my swahilis along theyre
all expert skinners thats important a
careless skinner can ruin a good specimen
this isnt a big-game hunt so thats all
right ross agreed ill want to take my
own headman mbani thats all and
dont worry about the makuas theyve
got a bad name but its just a matter of
camp discipline understanding their lingo
and tabus thats what youre paying me
for

  good when can we start

  you have your license of course
  took it out at beria may i see

stories

yours sleigh held out his hand

  sure murmured ross with a slight
frown he fished the booklet out of the
breast pocket of his shirt it served the
dual purpose of passport and discharge-
book on the fly leaf there was a photo-
graph and a physical description of the
holder the remaining pages gave a rec-
ord of previous engagements with a signed
reference from each client

  sleigh thumbed through the pages
quickly but examined the fly-leaf care-
fully hes not married jennifer he
commented with his crooked smile and
handed the bqok to the girl

  hm-m-m she mused over it
thirty-five six feet curly haired pan
everything-lord youd better start run-
ning mr bain

  any reason why we shouldnt start
in the morning bain sleigh put in be-
fore ross could answer

  four oclock is a good time he said
as the girl handed his book back to him
with a dazzling smile ill have a chat
with your headman and check your loads
now

  that wont be necessary said sleigh
amuku knows his business

  i dont doubt it but im responsible
for what happens from now on id like
to check

  oh all right sleigh agreed but
there are two cases of scientific equip-
ment plainly marked be careful with
them he smiled tolerantly

wont touch em ross grinned
back at him im not a customs officer

i	just want to see that weve got whats
needed for the trip

  the smile faded slowly from sleighs
face as ross went down the steps he
turned and blinked at the girl

  odd thing for him to say he
muttered

   she shrugged lit a cigarette dont tell
me that youre getting nervous brother
dear she said with a tinge of malice in her
voice sleigh scowled at her and stamped
into the bungalow

  ross walked across the clearing to
where swahilis guiet now sat around a
fire sleighs headman rose and detached
himself from the group as ross shouted
lost safari

 

his name he wore a brocaded vest which
left his muscular arms and deep broad
chest bare a scarlet cummerbund belted
his white duck pants and the lobe of his
left ear was missing it looked as if it had
been sliced off by a sabre cut for there
was a pink scar running down from it across
his cheek to the corner of his mouth he
walked with a swagger his hand resting
on the hilt of a knife in an ornate scabbard
thrust into his cummerbund ross didnt
like his bold eyes and guessed that hed
seen service in one of the native regiments
probably as a sergeant

  muttering under his breath and with a
scowl on his hard face amuku followed
ross with a lantern checking over the
loads they came to a couple of cases one
on top of the other marked with a red
cross

  open them said ross over his
shoulder

  much trouble growled amuku

  ross turned on his heel to face the
headman his eyes measuring him you
want to be paid off he asked evenly

  you no fit for drive me retorted the
headman me blong bwana sleigh big
time

ross eyes flashed and he rap-
ped out a dozen stinging words in
swahili amuku stiffened and stood like
an ebony statue but he was working up
his nerve his brash eyes rolled and his
lips moved though no audible sound came
from them in a sudden fit of temper
he turned and yanked at the upper-most
case it came down on ross toe and he

let out a yelp of pain amuku spat and
grinned then ross hit him

  the blow knocked the headman off his
feet but he was up again in an instant
and ross felt the muscles in his belly
tighten as he saw his curved knife flash
from its scabbard he met amukus
leopard-like charge with his shoulder rid-
ing it and twisting his body

  the blade clinked on the buckle of
his belt sliced through leather and flashed
before his eyes

  then he had amukus arm over his
shoulder with a grunt of exertion he
twisted around and flipped the big black
over amuku flopped across the case with
a sickening thud and the sound of splinter-
ing wood with the wind knocked out of
him he rolled off the case with his knees
drawn up to his chin ross kicked the
knife from his hand

  the fight was out of amuku when he
got to his feet he backed away as ross
advanced upon him

  no trouble bwana he gasped no
trouble

  go get your pay said ross curtly

  amuku started to say something but
thought better of it and ran for the bun-
galow muttering under his breath

  ross roused a couple of the porters and
after the cases were checked and re-packed
to his satisfaction he started for the bun-
galow as he was crossing the clearing
sleighs figure appeared out of the
shadows

  i say bain cant you overlook this
trouble with amuku he asked hes
one of my best skinners yknow
	jungle

  ross shook his head and said dryly
he is handy with a knife but id like to
keep my skin mr sleigh

  sleigh rubbed his chin thoughtfully
then i dont want to lose him i can
guarantee that you wont have any more
trouble with him look here suppose i
keep him as my personal boy and leave
the rest to your boy mbani  ill pay him
headmans wages and a bonus at the end
of the trip how does that suit you

  ross considered this he didnt like it
a man with a grudge was bad medicine on
safari some of it in fact was apt to get
into a mans grub but mbani could use
the money he certainly had it coming to
him and mbani could cook his grub

  well if its that important all right
he conceded just keep amuku out of
my hair

  they were up and away in the pallor of
the false dawn following a trail that
wiggled up the side of a hill rain had
fallen during the night but the roof of the
jungle had not leaked and the path was
dry a sure sign that the rainy season was
over

  ross at the head of the little caravan
with mbani swinging along beside him
lantern in hand sang as they marched it
was always the same with him when the
grey drift of light among the crowded
trees closed around him and the odor of
forest mould rose under his feet--always
the same thrill an unaccountable yearning
for excitement the strong vice of the
lover of the wilderness

  they struck the revue river at its con-
fluence with a perennial stream that
meandered down from the watershed
along the rhodisian border they made
camp beside a deep pool an hour before
sunset

  ross was in his tent stripped to the
waist and bending over a canvas tub while
mbani doused his head with water when
jennifer sleigh walked in on him he told
her to get out but she laughed and sat
on the edge of his cot watching the coil
of muscles under his brown skin as he
toweled himself vigorously

  not bad she commented

  ross flushed and shrugged into his shirt
only then he noticed that she was wearing

stories

  a short khaki skirt that revealed dimpled
knees

  not bad yourself he grinned to cov-
er his embarassment

  she stretched out her legs eyeing them
critically no she agreed men pay to
see worse

  then ross eyes came to rest on the
small-bore shot-gun resting on the cot
beside her

  you promised to take me shooting
she reminded him her eyes following his

  well all right said he theres a
marsh about a mile from here we might
get a duck or two before supper

he got his rifle and led the way up
stream the girl followed close at
his heels making enough noise to scare
off all the game within a mile they reach-
ed the marsh tall reeds covered its sur-
face except for a few patches of open
water that mirrored the blue of the sky
white and red star-shaped flowers flam-
ing against the green of the jungle and the
strong-smelling hibiscus scented the glade
looking at the girl as she crouched behind
the reeds tense and eager ross noticed
that her skin which had been burned a
fiery red was now peeling and showing a
soft golden tan underneath again he
found himself wondering about her there
was a risque toughness in her make-up that
he could not fathom he could see her in
the front row of a chorus flaunting her
perfect legs he could not picture her
among the social clique that chemly came
from

  he reddened guiltily as the girl turned
her head and caught him staring at her
she regarded him carefully for a moment
her expression changing from surprise to
one of amused speculation

  you know she said with gentle deri-
son i dont think you quite approve of
me ross

  havent seen a thing that could be im-
proved on ross grinned

  thats a polite lie she said and turned
her head away quickly i dont see any-
thing to shoot at so- oh look

  she was pointing down the narrow game
trail they had followed there no more
than fifteen yards from them a buck had
lost safari



come to slack his thirst head arched be-
tween slender legs

  isnt he beautiful breathed the girl

  ross touched her arm silencing her
through the screen of refeds his trained
eye had seen the slinking form of a leopard
fawn hide and black rosette spots almost
invisible in the underbush in a moment
he knew the swift drama of jungle life
and death would be enacted before their
yes

  the girl saw the leopard as it crossed the
trail stealthily approaching to within
springing distance of the buck it was a
beautiful specimen-a hundred and forty
pounds of concentrated ferocity and blood-
lust-the ground color of its fur pale fawn
to rufus buff graduating to pure white on
the underparts

  the girls mind was slow to grasp the
import of what she saw then she uttered
a little gasp of horror and before ross
could make a move to stop her she threw
up her shotgun and let go with both bar-
rels ross felt the hair rise from his scalp
his mouth was still open to shout but he
had uttered no sound he saw the leopard
jump sideways snapping at its hindquar-
ters then crouch snarling tawny wicked
eyes glaring at the girl who stood utterly
motionless fascinated by fear

  it had all happened in a split second and
ross fired from the hip before that second
was out hoping to check the beasts charge
he heard the impact of his bullet then
with a yell he shouldered the girl and sent
her sprawling as the feopard sprang he
fired again blindly as the white underbelly
came hurtling toward him he had the
presence of mind to draw up his knees as
he went down

  he was on his back suddenly with snarl-
ing fury on top of him he caught the
beast by its ruff and held it off with arms
and legs that had the strength of despera-
tion in them but he knew that he could
not hold on long could not save himself
from the slashing razor claws blood from
a wound in the beasts throat trickled down
his rigid forearms and he knew his last
shot had hit and hung on for his life as
the leopards struggles became feebler fin-
ally it rolled over and lay on its side
muscles twitching

ross got slowly to his feet and then
began to curse as his nerves reacted to
the shock of it he looked around for the
girl she was on hands and knees amid
the reeds she blinked up at him

  you-you blasted- ross began

savagely then remembering she was a
woman took a deep breath and clamped
his mouth shut

  youre hurt she exclaimed ross shirt
was tom from his shoulder and he was
bleeding freely

  of course i am he snapped im
lucky to be alive and so are you ive taken
some fools into the jungle in my time but
never one that did a thing like that

  it was so close i didnt think i could
miss she explained

  ross spread his hands in a despairing
gesture miss sleigh he said patiently
you didnt miss but a child should know
better than to take a pot shot at a leopard
with a shotgun

  you saved my life she said as if the
thought had just struck her

  theres not an accident against me
yet growled ross my little book is
clean

  i see she said slowly a clean
record that must mean a great deal to
you ross

  its all ive got said he then as his
ear caught the odd inflection in her voice
he gave her a sharp look but her face was
blank she said better let me fix that
shoulder-
	jungle

  mbani will do a better job said ross
and strode off down the trail a little sur-
prised at his own surliness

  it was dark when they got back to the
camp sleigh was seated in the mess tent
smoking he eyed the girl and ross curi-
ously as they came in

  good lord he jumped up as he
caught sight of ross shoulder what
happened 

  had a little trouble with a leopard
ross told him ill need the first aid kit

  it looks bad

  ross shook his head i got off lucky
ive seen thorns do worse

  ah said sleigh in a relieved tone
im glad to hear that i want to pull out
in the morning push on to bometelas
kraal

  ross was surprised and his face showed
it sleigh glanced at his face obliquely and
continued i want to set up a base camp

i	like to work systematically with the ab-
solute minimum of discomfort once we
set up a permanent camp you and the boys
can range for the beef and fight the
mosquitoes ill stay at home and look
after the skinning and the cataloguing

  robert the girl put in sharply
youre not very considerate mr bain
should rest for a few days

  thats up to bain replied sleigh
sourly

  i think its up to you she insisted

  sleigh looked at her his eyes narrowing
in thoughtful appraisal you seem to
have forgotten the importance of time
jennifer he said carefully among other
things he added significantly

  the girls lips tightened watching her
ross thought he saw the shape of fear be-
hind her silence said he ill take no
harm miss sleigh she gave him an
enigmatical smile and turned away

  outside in the night he paused to think
there was something queer in all this
they were in a naturalists paradise in
fact theyd been treking through one for
three days now but for all the attention
sleigh paid to it they might just as well be
in the sahara desert there didnt seem
to be much of the scientists enthusiasm
about him on the trial he plodded along
morose and silent oblivious to his sur-

stories

roundings except to curse the mosquitoes
and complain of delays but he had an
explanation for it he liked his comfort
he wanted a base camp let him have it
ross shrugged and trudged off to his tent

  they turned westward working their
way up stream toward the rhodesian bord-
er they were well into bometelas coun-
try when they made camp two days later

  an hour after sunrise on the following
morning they struck a trail wide and firm
enough to allow the passage of a large
cart presently they came upon a couple
of stripped palms one on each side of the
road with offerings to the local fetish
hanging from them and there was a log
half buried athwart the trail a charm to
keep the leopards away from the village  

the village itself was crouched
upon a cleared plateau overlooking the
river-a collection of frail huts with
thatched roofs

  old bometela and his people came out to
meet them and in a moment they were
surrounded by warriors stern-visaged and
of splendid build women and children the
latter as tenacious as gadflies and twice as
irritating there was a rest house bome-
tela told them but the roof had fallen in
he graciously offered them his palaver
house as a shelter-an offer that ross
hastily countered with a gift and a request
for permission to make camp a mile up
stream from the village where they would
be assured of un-polluted water

  do you want me to hire a few hunt-
ers ross asked sleigh

  of course sleigh answered but
lets get settled first

  as soon as the tents were up ross sent
for mbani

  keep the swahilis away from the vil-
lage he ordered i want no trouble with
the makuas

  yes bwana the big makua answered
then stood fidgeting with a dubious look
on his grim black face

  something wrong asked ross

  it may be that the swahili dogs will not
do as i tell them bwana they say amuku
is their headman

  you are their headman ross told him
are you afraid of swahilis 
lost safari



  mbam spat contemptously but there
iare twelve of them we are only two
bwana he added	v

  ross gave him a quick look so thats
the way it is you smell trouble eh
they make much talk at night bwana
what do they say 

  it is the speech of apes bwana how
should i know

  it that all mbani 

  yes bwana

  ross dismissed him but watched him
cross over to where the swahilis were
pitching the cook tent with a frown be-
tween his eyes he was inclined to think
that mbani was expressing his deep-seated
distrust of all who were not makua in
origin certainly sleighs crew knew their
job and they seemed to be willing enough

  later he picked up his rifle and went
over to the mess tent he found sleigh and
jennifer sprawled out in camp chairs be-
hind billowing mosquito-netting jennifer
opened one eye as he entered and said
have a drink ross

  sleigh only grunted and ross said
theres a spot up stream id like you to
take a look at mr sleigh a good place
to set up a boma if you like it ill get the
boys started on it

  huh-oh yes of course sleigh
heaved himself up stiffly yawned and
jammed on his helmet come on jen-
nifer theres no rest in the man

  ross led them down a narrow trail that
passed under a continuous archway of
boughs so thick that the sunlight only
filtered through it and dappled the leafy
loam or sparkled on the noisy river all
along was the spoor of the game that used
the trail the diamond-shaped hoof prints
of antelope hippo slides in the clay banks
of the river and trees deeply scored four-
teen feet above the ground where elephants
had paused to sharpen their tusks

  further on the river narrowed to a
gorge the lap and wash of the rapid had
worn the stone bed into great dark folds
which in places enclosed patches of golden
sand and pebbles on the opposite bank
the ground sloped down and trees arched
over a green pool fed by miniature falls
with a lacy rainbow mist rising from its
edges cream balls and water lilies shone

with pearl-like lustre amid the green and
strongly scented the air

  ross halted motioning his companions
to silence after a few minutes life came
back to the pool a monitor invisible be-
fore slid from a fallen tree and there was
a flash of turquoise light as a kingfisher
swooped down on a swarm of insects
ross pointed as the surface of the pool was
ruffled a great snake swam across it with
a bird just caught held in its jaws

  its a box seat he whispered youll
see all there is to see here and the light is
good for photography

  but sleigh was not listening he was
not even watching he sat on a log with
his back turned to the pool wiping sweat
from his forehead his face was flushed

  feeling rough ross asked

  yes sleigh answered wearily a
touch of fever i think

  better get back to camp then ross
started back down the trail they had not
gone far when the girl stopped pointing
upwards look monkeys she exclaimed

the whole troop crossed in
front of them leaping the narrow gap
across the path high overhead like fleeting
grey shadows and making a good deal
of noise while they were about it one
of them a young fellow misjudged his
distance and fell he lay on the ground
badly hurt and whimpering like a child
a shot from ross rifle put him out of his
misery

  its not often you see one fall he
commented

  sleigh stood looking down at the little
creature with a puzzled expression too
young to hold on with its tail i suppose

  ross eyes opened wide with astonish-
ment he stood utterly still staring at
sleigh his mind slow to accept implica-
tion of the others words

  whats wrong demanded sleigh look-
ing around nervously

  dont you know asked ross quietly

  damn it no said sleigh irritably
should i

  i think so rbss said with a faint
smile

  sleighs glance shuttled to the girl she
shrugged and his eyes came back to ross
	jungle

again his face showed signs of internal
distress then he muttered something
about a headache turned on his heel quick-
ly and strode off down the trail jennifer
followed him

  ross stood watching them with a broad
grin on his face he wasnt a naturalist
but he knew that african monkeys did not
swing by their tails only the new world
monkeys the cebidae had prehensible tails
sleigh might have passed it off as a joke
but he had not he knew hed made a
faux pas but he didnt even know where
hed gone wrong

  naturalists my foot murmured ross
then the grin faded from his face but
if he wasnt a naturalist what was he
why this masquerade in the jungle it
was not his nature to nurse a grievance
or suspicion and he didnt like being led by
the nose into anything he headed back to
camp determined to have it out with
sleigh

  but sleigh had another idea when
ross got back to camp he was stretched
out on his cot groaning and the odd part
of it was the real symptoms of fever
ross suspected that it was the mild kind-
recurrent shakes and temperatures but
sleigh was making the most of it he ram-
bled incoherently when spoken to sweated
and groaned to be on the safe side ross
got him under blanket then measured out
doses of quinine and left him with the girl

  jennifer did not show up for the evening
meal and ross ate alone in the mess tent
later he sat smoking thinking back won-
dering snatches of conversation meager
details passed through his mind and came
out woven into a pattern carefully he
considered it there was sleighs con-
nection with chemly-not necessarily what
he said it was the fact that hed come in
with his own gang jennifer sleigh-there
was something wrong about the brother
and sister relationship he felt it sleighs
indifference the monkey incident and
more yes it all pointed to those two cases
of scientific equipment that sleigh didnt
want disturbed the answer was in those
cases

  he rose knocking the ashes from his
pipe the cases stood in a corner of the
tent under several others he dragged

stories

them out it took him some time to pry
off the locks eagerly he unpacked them and
then stood amid the litter of their contents
swearing softly with a look of bewilder-
ment on his face there were books neat-
ly labled bottles chloroform specimens in
alcohol-an entomologists field equipment

  now you can put them all back again

  ross turned slowly to face jennifer
sleigh her blonde head was thrust
through the opening of the tent and she
was looking at him with derision in her
eyes ross stared at her blankly while
his face grew red with anger and guilt

  what did you expect to find she
asked mildly curious

  anything but this ross anwered
shortly

  oh-why 

  why well damn it because african
monkeys dont swing by their tails

  i see suppressed laughter quirked
the corners of her mouth roberts only
an amateur she hastened to explain-
too glibly ross thought and hes really
interested in bugs he should have told
you

  ross smile was slow he said he
did he mentioned skinners and ive never
heard of a man skinning a bug

  oh well she shrugged

  why are you afraid of him he asked
trying to catch her off balance it didnt
work

  hes got a violent temper he can make
things damned unpleasant she answered
blandly

  ross gave her a long steady look then i
all right miss sleigh i guess i stuck
my chin out

  she smiled dont lose any sleep over
it ross no harms been done ill help
you pack that stuff

  by the time they had finished the camp
had settled down for the night sleighs
tent was the only one showing a light
drums were throbbing over at the makua
village and the bull-frogs were singing
their blatant serenades down among the
reeds ross put out the lights and held
the flap of the tent up for the girl to go
out she ducked under his arm and came
up very close to him

  ross- she started to tell him some-
lost safari	

thing but broke off the signs o inward
strife plainly showing on her face but
ross was conscious only of her perfume
the out-thrust of her breasts warm through
his shirt her shoulder touched his arm
holding up the flap the moment was ir-
resistible his arm slid down about her
waist she yielded her body arching to
his he kissed her and her lips clung
to his for a breathless moment then she
pushed him off with an oath that made
his ears burn

  dont get any ideas about me ross 
she said breathing quickly just forget
that

  why should i demanded ross

  youll find out she looked up into
his face briefly appealingly then she
ran for her tent

ross looked up at the stars youre
damned right i will he muttered
that brother of yours is after something
and it isnt bugs my girl

  after a moment of deliberation he start-
ed to cross the clearing for his own tent
as he was passing the cook tent he hauled
up to listen someone was scuffling around
inside one of the boys stealing grub ross
guessed

  come out of there he shouted

  there was absolute quiet for a moment
then a stiffled scream and a figure burst
out of the tent and came flying towards
him with a rush of air and the jingle of
metal

  bwana bwana a makua girl stark
naked but for the beads and bangles around
her wrists and ankles flung herself at his
feet amuku came out after her he pul-
led up short as he caught sight of ross
then advanced slowly his chin thrust out
brash eyes glinting in the moonlight

  the girl clung to ross legs whimpering
gently he lifted her to her feet

  she mine you make no trouble
growled amuku

  did you take money from this man
ross asked the girl in the makua dialect
the sound of her own tongue heartened
the girl from behind the shield of ross
broad shoulders she hissed and spat at
amuku like a kitten at a tomcat

  no she said scornfully he caught

me by the pool where we bathe at night

  go back to the village ross told her
and say to bometela that i will come to
palavar about this thing tomorrow

  as the girl turned and raced away amu-
ku made after her ross stepped into his
path and landed a blow that lifted the
black off his feet and set him down on his
knees

  i said no man was to go to the village
said ross coldly i am going to drive
you amuku

  the big swahili went for his knife but
ross was too quick for him this time he
darted in and kicked it from the blacks
hand as it flashed from the scabbard then
he stepped in slugging but amuku faded
backwards riding his punches suddenly
he rushed and his arms caught ross in a
crushing embrace ross gasped as the
pressure tightened about his ribs and knew
that he was in serious trouble he feltx a
rush of fear as his feet left the ground
amuku threw him hard and he hit the
ground with a thud that rattled every bone
in his body he lashed out desperately as
amuku dived for him the headman turn-
ed a somersault and flopped on his back
ross was on his feet in an instant but
before he could jump back amuku had
him by the ankles and his feet were jerked
from under him

  they rolled over and over grunting with
exertion amuku clawing at ross face
trying to gouge his eyes ross was the
more powerful man and he had a cooler
head but amuku had oiled himself recently
and it was some time before ross could
fasten a good grip onto him at last he
got amukus arm up behind his back and
amuku began to howl for help

  ross heard jennifers scream mingle
with shouts and the pad of bare running
feet in a moment the other swahilis were
milling about jabbering like a cage full of
monkeys hands clawed at him his shirt
was ripped from his back he released
amuku and sprang to his feet lashing out
right and left with fists and feet the
swahilis fell back under the barrage of
blows that left two of thepi stretched out
cold ross got a fleeting picture of sleigh
clad in gaudy stripped pajamas standing
in the opening of his tent jennifer was
	jungle

beside him her eyes big with fear now
the swahilis were closing in on him sil-
ently warily then a gun exploded and a
bullet whined overhead on top of it
came mbanis wild war cry he came
charging wild-eyed and swinging ross
gun-belt around his head the swahilis in
his path scattered

  good boy ross gasped in relief he
took the heavy automatic from mbanis
hand under the menace of it amuku and
his swahilis froze ross looked them over
with cold eyes said he amuku did not
obey mbani he stole makua girl

  a low murmur of dismay went up from
the swahilis curses and angry looks were
thrown at amuku the big headman seem-
ed to shrink

  what will the makuas do about this
thing ross asked then as the swahilis
began to jabber in panic and some to
slink away he laughed

  no good to run away his clear voice
rang out makua drums will talk tonight
you are dead men if i do not speak for
you then they were crowding around
him pleading begging he silenced them
and said

  amuku will give his wages as a peace
offering to chief bometela and i will
palavar with him now let each man put
his knife at mbanis feet i have spoken
it was done without a murmur of pro-
test ross holstered his automatic and
strode over to the sleighs his eyes trucu-
lent jennifer ducked into the tent as he
approached

  were heading back to macequece
mr sleigh he announced just as soon
as youre fit to travel in the thin silence
that followed he watched anger come alight
in sleighs black eyes saw it twist his
face into an ugly grimace

  damn it sleigh exploded youre
a bit high-handed bain ill tell you

when-

  im telling you ross cut him short
ive had more trouble with you in six
days than ive had in as many years i
dont know what your game is i dont
care my job is to get you back to mace-
quece safe from the look of things
thats not going to be too damned easy
so shut up and pack up

stories

with that off his chest ross felt
better and stamped off to his tent
but he didnt sleep the swahilis were
holding a palaver in the cook tent he
could hear the hum of their voices above
the stridence of the jungle night he
didnt know what to expect he pinned
up the flap of his tent so that he had a
good view of the clearing put out the
lamp and sat in the darkness with his rifle
across his knees he dozed off with the
rumble of drums in his ears

  he opened his eyes with a start the
moon was still high and the first thing he
saw was sleigh in his gaudy pajamas his
loose slippers making a flapping sound
as he picked his way carefully across the
clearing ross first thought was that he
was sleep-walking he half rose then
sank back as he saw sleigh was headed
for the cook tent after pausing to look
around sleigh dived into the tent and the
murmur of voices ceased minutes passed
then he came out with amuku the big
swahili had a pack on his back and car-
ried a rifle the pair stood talking for a
while in hushed voices then amuku left
the camp but he did not take the trail
back to the maceguece he was headed up
stream toward the rhodesian border

  utterly motionless and completely be-
wildered ross watched sleigh return to
his own tent presently the other swa-
hilis came out and drifted like shadows
across the clearing to their quarters sleep
settled on the camp

  ross shook his head while a profound
sense of depression and foreboding took
possession of him it was all very strange
there was an ugly bewilderment about it
what was behind it what could sleigh
be after here in the jungle a hundred
miles from anywhere  he could think
of nothing he turned in swearing softly
under his breath consigning sleigh and all
his works to hell

  jennifer showed up for breakfast the
next morning while mbnai served
them they talked casually but as soon as
he had cleaned up and left the tent ross
said your brothers fever seemed to be
much better last night miss sleigh

  she fumbled in her shirt pocket for a
cigarette ross struck a match for her
lost

   hes not my brother she said as she
 leaned toward the match

   ross stared at her it was the confes-
 sion not the fact that startled him he
 held the match until it burned his fingers
 then dropped it with an oath and caught
 her wrist

  good lord-your husband

  no she laughed

  maybe hed like to be

  no she snatched her hand away
and jumped to her feet im just sick of
lies she cried you get out of here
ross fast dont let him talk you out
of it

  why

  never mind just pack and head for
home

   ross leaned back in his chair grinning
 up at her said he you know i dont
 think theres as much brass in you as youd
 like me to think maybe i should stick
 around

  youre crazy if you do

  youre in some kind of trouble tell
me more id like to help

  dont you try and big brother me
she flared just get out of here

  ross smiled slowly was there any-
thing brotherly in that kiss last night he
asked

   she gave him a startled look opened her
 mouth to speak but shut it again as
 sleighs shadow fell across the tent

  what are you two shouting about
he demanded as he came in his eyes dart-
ing suspiciously from one to the other

  youll get a chill walking around in
those pajamas ross said

  sleigh looked at him blankly then
turned to jennifer id like to eat he
said plaintively

  ill get mbani jennifer gave ross
a meaning look and went out

   sleigh sank into a chair with a groan
 dont let what happened last night up-
 set you bain i need you i was wrong
 in bringing amuku along hes a trouble
 maker i sent him packing last night in
 the hope that youd reconsider

  ross was conscious of a feeling of ex-
asperation sleigh was too fast for him
he always beat him to the punch with an
explanation that on the surface at least

safari	

 had the color of truth he asked why
 did he go west

   oh the makuas he didnt want to
 pass near the village he smiled crook-
 edly and went on i paid him his wages
 in full i knew youd object so i did it
 when you werent around thought it
 was the best way to avoid trouble

   ross smiled wryly there it was again
 all the loose ends tied-too damned neat-
 ly it occurred to him that he might
 make better progress if he kept his mouth
 shut he said im on my way over to
 the makua village about that girl theyll
 ask for plenty it may take a day or two
 to get it settled he watched sleighs
 worried expression change into one of
 quiet satisfaction he thought he likes
 the delay hes playing for time some-
 thing is going to happen soon and
 sleighs next words seemed to confirm his
 thought

   anything you say bain he approved
 the cash is here when you want it

 as usual the palaver was a long-
 drawn out affair all the members
 of the girls family made a speech then
 it developed that half her bride-price had
 already been paid by a fine young warrior
 and his claim was vociferously pressed by
 three generations of his kin ross was
 glad to settle for twice the girls full bride-
 price before he ran into further compli-
 cations he left promising to return with
 the equivalent in cash on the following
 morning

   it was midnight before he got back to
 camp utterly worn out with talk and
 feeling the kick of the palm wine hed
 drunk he stripped to the waist flopped
 on his cot and was soon asleep

   the sun was high when he awoke he
 had a bad taste in his mouth and wanted
 coffee he shouted for mbani there
 was no answer he shouted again still
 no answer and cursing he started to dress
 his shirt felt light in his hand he felt
 the pockets his passport and license
 were missing a quick startled glance
 around the tent revealed that his rifle and
 automatic were also missing his jaw set
 and his eyes hardened

   then ross steamed off to the mess tent
	jungle

when he entered sheer astonishment jolted
the rage out of him sleigh was seated
at the table and beside him stood another
white man-a tall fellow with dark curl-
ing hair wearing a belted tattered cordu-
roy jacket

  ross eyes measured him then fastened
onto his face there was something
familiar about the fellow hed seen him
before somewhere years ago

  the stranger was looking him up and
down now rubbing the beard stubble on
his chin with his hand making a rasping
sound against the jungle silence

  theres a striking resemblance he re-
marked in a soft cultured voice

  ross mouth opened and he stared fool-
ishly his mind slow to accept what he
heard but there it was considering him
with cold grey eyes-his own image no
not his image exactly the face was a
little different it was longer the eyes
more closely set but in build and color-
ing the two men were alike as two peas
in a pod

  oh chemly had it figured out all
right said sleigh with his license
you could get by an army eddy

  my license-say what is this ross
demanded

  sleigh chuckled and his mouth slid up
to his ear

  like you to meet an old colleague of
mine bain-the rare specimen we came
to look for youve heard of him im
sure eddy talman

  talman the i d b man ross whis-
tled softly he was beginning to under-
stand eddy talman was the smartest
illicit diamond buyer in africa three
months ago hed made a big haul then
shot a joburg policeman and escaped
northward

  i gather that you have heard of me
said talman and you have the good
fortune to look very like me mr
bain

  what does that mean ross asked
hed guessed the answer but he wanted
to be sure

  perhaps this will save time talman
took a passport book from his pocket and
handed it to him ross looked at the fly
leaf the physical description tallied

stories

with his own all that was needed was
to change the photographs

   its a change of identity i contemplate
bain talman said cooly a temporary
one of course

  of course said ross dryly but
somebody might get to wondering what
happened to me back at macequece
why should they you havent been
to the coast in ten years well you went
on safari with sleigh you work your
way down to joboto on the coast sleigh
decides to work new territory he in-
vites you to go along he books a steamer
passage for you you go or rather i do
dyou think the portuguese johnnies will
 catch on to that 

  ross saw only too clearly that they
would not what he couldnt see was a
permanent spot for ross bain in the shape
of future events

   its where i go that interests me tal-
man he said

  you lose yourself in the jungle for
three months and you take five hundred
pounds sterling to make it worth your
while of course amuku and his boys
will go along with you just to see that
you keep to your end of the bargain after
that if youre smart youll get yourself a
new license and keep your mouth shut
you make it sound just lovely said
bain with a thin-lipped smile maybe
youll tell me how i got into this rotten
mess

  why not it was cherniys idea
weve worked together for years-thats
why he like macequece close to the bor-
der ysee well on this occasion i had a
spot of trouble at joburg i have to get my-
self and the diamonds out of the country
without chemly and you-well im grate-
ful to the extent of five hundred pounds
and miss sleigh jennifer

   talman laughed youll admit that she
has what it takes to make a man forget
his better judgment bain man bait just
man bait

  ross flushed it was the unvarnished
truth but he didnt like hearing it she
cared enough to warn me the thought
startled him and he asked quickly
wheres my boy mbani

  just forget about him im giving
lost safari



you your chance to get clear said tal-
man

  a hell of a chance said ross grimly
but maybe its better than you think

  meaning

  just what i said

almans cold eyes bored into
him sleigh tells me youre in-
clined to throw your weight around but
dont get funny with me bain sleigh
doesnt like to play rough but i do re-
member i can use you dead or alive bet-
ter dead perhaps go back to your tent
and stay there we start for the coast at
sunset

  better dead than alive ross left the
tent with words ringing in his ears and a
cold feeling in the pit of his stomach his
mutilated body found in the - jungle with
talmans passport would suit talman
much better he had no illusions about
that even if talman meant to play it
straight amuku and the swahilis would
cut his throat on the first opportunity it
was likely talman had it figured that way

  suddenly he knew fear-sheer sweat-
ing panic his first thought was to start
running and his eyes swept the clearing
looking for something to dodge behind
they came to rest on amuku who stood
watching him rifle in hand with an
oath ross got a grip on himself from
now on someone would always be watch-
ing him hed have to depend on his wits

  he went to his tent and took a stiff tot
of brandy he felt better for days hed
been blundering around in the dark now
he knew what he was up against be-
sides it was a way to the coast hed
think of something between here and jo-
tobo he poured out another tot of brandy
as he put the glass down a drum began
to rumble over at the makua village he
glanced at his watch with a frown re-
membering that hed promised to pay bo-
metela this morning it was a few min-
utes after noon he remembered that he
hadnt told sleigh about his agreement
with the makua chief he took a pace
toward the opening of his tent then pulled
up short as the idea struck him

  he sat down turning it over in his mind

-j ungle-winter

why should he tell sleigh if bometela
wasnt paid hed come to collect backed up
by his young warriors spoiling for a fight
it was cold blooded if a false move was
made it would end in a massacre ross
poured himself another brandy and swal-
lowed it well he was as good as a dead
man and so was mbani a man had the
right to gamble for his life let bome-
tela come with a grim smile ross sat
down to wait

  as the sun declined from meridian the
maku war drums began to throb the
volume of sound increased slowly and
ross knew that bometala was on the
march presently one of the swahilis
came running into the camp shouting for
sleigh soon the whole dozen of them
were grouped about amuku jabbering and
gesticulating they were yapping about
the makua girl they were scared and
so were sleigh and talman by the look
of them they had come out of the mess
tent talman stood looking in the direc-
tion of the native village sleigh was
waving his arms at amuku ordering him
to serve out guns and ammunition

  ho bain come over here sleigh
shouted

  ross buckled on his empty gun-belt and
sauntered over to them the makuas
were close now the chant of the war-
riors was audible above the rumble of
the drums

  you settled with them about that girl
didnt you sleigh wanted to know

  i dont recall saying so ross mur-
mured we werent able to reach an
agreement

  what do they want demanded tal-
man

  ross jerked his thumb in amukus di-
rection him he said laconically and
grinned as the other swahilis edged away
from their headman

  talman swore ill give them a belly-
ful of lead thats what

  if youre thinking of that youd better
give me a gun suggested ross

  talman looked at him suspicion in his
cold eyes it could be that youre try-
ing to work something bain

  you know their lingo sleigh put in
you dont need a gun to talk to them
	jungle

  sure ill talk to them ross agreed

  i dont like it talman interposed
sharply anybody else speak their lingo
in camp sleigh 

  beads of sweat dropped from sleighs
forehead as he shook his head and the
swahilis were showing increasing signs
of nervousness as the makua war-chant
grew in volume

  i guess its got beyond talking said
ross with unruffled calm well all be as
full of makua spears as my aunts pin-
cushion before long

  at the moment the makua debouched
out of the forest inito the clearing-tall
light-footed warriors all of them with the
sun gleaming on their oiled bodies and
winking on their spear heads they
formed a compact mass at the edge of
the clearing while their drums throbbed a
a frenzied rhythm a truly terrifying
sight talman and sleigh were staring
with their mouths open

   for petes sake do something
bain talmans voice quavered

  theyre working themselves up
gasped sleigh and started to back
away the swahilis stood utterly still
watching the white men sensing their fear

  dont move dont shoot ross
voice rang out clear commanding obedi-
ence

suddenly the drums stopped then
with a blood-chilling howl the makuas
charged it was too much for the swahilis
they dropped their guns and bolted for the
bush amuku well in the lead

  panic was what ross had gambled on
as the makuas swept across the clearing
in a cloud of dust he swung on sleigh
who was standing closest to him the
blow stunned sleigh and he sank to his
knees before talman realized what was
happening ross had scooped up sleighs
gun and stood facing him

  drop it talman ross warned

 blast you- talman cocked and

his gun spat fire he missed and a split
second later he fell on his face with a neat
hole between the eyes

  ross whirled to face the charging ma-
kuas arms upraised and shouting at the
top of his yoice bometelas bull voice

stories

roared out a command above the tumult
like a black wave the warriors dashed to
within ten feet of ross then halted and
receded forming a semi-circle about their
chief an attendant dashed forward with
an umbrella and the regal stool old
bometela sat on it a picture of bewildered
and outraged majesty

  when quiet came and the dust had set-
tled ross flung his gun at the chiefs
feet the evil-doer is dead chief he
announced dramatically

  ha said bometela with evident satis-
faction i did not think that you would
cheat me my friend it is a good thing
for you that you did not run with those
swahili dogs see he rose and tossed
his spear in the direction in which the
swahilis had fled with a wild yell twenty
young makua warriors dashed off like
blood hounds slipped from the leash

  call them back chief urged ross

  why asked bometela

  ross had to tell him the whole story
twice before he was satisfied then he
beckoned to his headman and talked it
over with them while ross sweated hop-
ing that fear would give wings to the
swahilis heels at last a decision was
reached and a drum throbbed recalling
the makua warriors but bometela was
no fool

  he saw ross need and his own advan-
tage and he grasped it firmly

  if he argued the one who was dead had
stolen government property would not
the government pay for its return did
not the bwana himself say that the com-
ing of bometelas warriors had saved him
it was clear that bometela had saved the
government property also and there-
fore was it not just that the reward be
paid to bometela

  half the reward is just chief ross
countered firmly i cannot tell how much
the government will pay let bometela
march with me to macequece let him
give me porters and i will speak for him

  let it be so bometela agreed never
doubting that he had the best of the bar-
gain

  ross picked out a dozen dusky makuas
four he sent to dig a hole for talman the
others to break camp then he walked

over to sleigh who stood rubbing his chin
like a man waking from a bad dream
wheres jennifer ross asked him
sleigh looked at him with vague eyes
in the cook tent with mbani he man-
aged to say at last

  well go there said ross

  jennifer and mbani were stretched out
on the floor bound hand and foot ross
released mbani

you take his place sleigh he said
look bain sleigh spoke eagerly
theres a poke of diamonds in my tent-
a fortune man easy for you to get away
with them  what about it

  do we split three ways asked ross
with his eyes fixed on the girl

  remember that record ross she
urged its clean keep it that way

  a grin settled on ross face he stooped
and slashed her bonds i want to talk to
you young lady

  he led her to the mess tent she took
the cigarette he offered to her lighted it
and sat down watching his face through
a veil of smoke

  you told talman you were through is
that right he asked then as she nod-
ded her head what made you change
your mind

  maybe i liked the way you stood up
for that makua girl she answered

  there was a pause while ross studied
her with thoughtful eyes then how
badly do the police want you jennifer
what difference does that make to
you

  i want to know jhow long ive got to
wait	

  she caught her breath her hand went
to her throat

  youre crazy ross im no good

  what have the police got against you 
ross insisted

  just what you know but youd bet-
ter listen ross she retreated behind
the table as he advanced toward her

  i met talman in london i fell for
him-he was like you only rotten inside
perhaps i thought diamond smuggling was
romantic but i knew it was on the
wrong side of the law i went in with
my eyes open and-

  ross caught her then and held her in his
arms all that is unimportant ive got
a good record as a white hunter but im
glad they dont put everything in that lit-
tle book im not asking questions and
im not answering any we start from
here

  suddenly she lifted her face to his and
her eyes were luminous and soft yes
she said breathlessly from here

 by dan cushman

   it was moye than the fire-juju of the ncimbo fetish priests
   that madeyankee jim dunn throw away his life-long dream
   of escaping luassa kraal

yankee jim dunn lay on his

back in the hammock listening to
the fly-drone of late afternoon
through slitted eyelids he could see the
bamboo undersides of the veranda roof
with here and there an irregular bit of
colorless sky

  for a long time it was like that then
a breeze from somewhere rustled the
thatch blades along the roof and he could
feel the gentle sway of the hammock he
remained still enjoying the rocking move-
ment to its end then using a minimum
of effort as a man learns after enough
years in the tropics lie swung out one of

his long arms and found the schnapps
bottle

it was empty

he cursed and hurled it at a verandah
pillar the bottle missed and sailed be-
yond the range of his eyes to the street
of the native village below

 suka-hati he called

 in time there was a responding shuffle
 of feet the crack of ladder rungs and
 a plump brown woman came in view over
 the verandah edge

yes luang f she asked placidly

the bottle havent you learned by
this time that white men dislike empty
bottles he laughed throatily

  she climbed on over the rail looked
around for the bottle glimpsed it on the
footpath street below

  ah-so then kenapa-why white men
make so many empty quick

  yankee jim stayed in the hammock
watching his brown woman move away
after shed disappeared a smile broke
the lines of his face good answer for a
perempuan too damned good she was
smart this suka-hati of his hed have
to take it out of her one of these eve-
nings no polynesian woman respects her
man unless he kicks in her slats once a
month

  she was back in three or four minutes
carrying a square brown bottle of
schnapps

  yankee jim spoke how - long since
that day i got you at mombasa

  the bottle was wet from the evapora-
tion cooler she set it down and dried her
hands on her kain belachu sarong for

a quarter-minute she looked far off at
the flaming mirage of late afternoon

  eighteen years allah in thy mercy
eighteen years of the tropics of huts
like this and heat and schnapps    he
lay looking up at the woman remember-
ing her the way shed been that first day
on the wharf over at hombasa shed
been fifteen years old-maybe less poly-
nesian girls mature early young and
slim waisted with breasts like a budding
venus not too damned well hidden by her
sarong hed smiled at her and shed
smiled back it had been easy as snap-
ping his fingers that and paying over
the six pounds sterling demanded by the
chinese who had brought her there on
five-year bond to work in his trinket
klong eighteen years and now shed
grown fat so her sarong fit her like bolt-
cloth wrapped around a bale of sisal

  he laughed and sat up putting bare
feet down on the mattings she watched

  the schnapps is good luang
	jungle

  in the jungle all schnapps is good

  he poured one in a little bronze cup
cut it with boiled water downed it many
white men on the congo grow fat on
liquor quinine and heat but yankee jim
was gaunt the country had dehydrated
him his muscles hajd turned to sinew
his skin darkened to the hue of okume
wood he moved slowly but strength
and catlike grace still lay in his long body

  call noka 

  suka-hati struck a gong of hindu
brass that hung from a roof beam in a
moment a bakete boy came carrying a
scrap of dampened cloth yankee jim
stretched out his feet and the bakete boy
squatted to bathe them

  bwana you have see other hondele-
man 

  where are they camped

  beyond cassava patchhe looked up
with eyes gone big and round many
guns bwana you hear guns like so
he held up ten fingers

  the boy finished by smearing merthi-
olate around his bwanas toenails then
slipped on his rope and canvas shoes the
shoes were wrinkled and laceless

  bwana will see them

  ill let them come to see me

sitting in the hammock he could see
the village footpath below it was
the end of the rains and clouds were
still heaped in massive blue-gray billows
beyond the khaya trees that surrounded
the clearing it would be another thirty
days before harmattan baked a crust over
the camel track from ghazal and allowed
the arab traders to come with their salt
and crude opium balls to barter for poor
mens daughters and longer still before
the hittites came from the east coast to
exchange their calcutta cottons and cheap
spanish machetes for that same opium
which would move from the blind harbors
of zanzibar into the trade streams of
commerce

  it was seldom white men came at all
to this deep hole of the jungle almost
never through the mire of rains he won-
dered what this safari could be for the
past three days the message drums had
relayed its progress following it down

stories

from the swamps of ngamo

  the sun went down in violet-red mist
village cookfires raised a stench of burn-
ing thatch from a domed mud and palm-
mat hut a monkey-skin drum was calling
fetish priests to their evening vo

  the boy came back carrying a halved
papaya he said bwana if bondele-man
whip native boy and native boy run
away    he stopped hunting for words
to go on

  what happened tonight what is it
you havent told me

  the boy just stood there eyes big and
round

  i asked what happened

  nothing bwana he backed away
giving the moslem salute hed learned
from arab traders nothing nothing
happen

  he was lying yankee jim watched
him slide over the edge of the verandah
and drop to the ground something be-
yond the ordinary had taken place during
siesta but it would be futile trying to
force information from a native time
would bring it out time-the unlimited
commodity of the tropics

  he sat in a native reed chair twisted a
cigarette of black inyorka tobacco lighted
it from the hanging candle inhaled strong
smoke to the farthermost centimetre of
his lungs his feet were stretched far
out he wore no sox and his canvas
shoes were open his pants of white cal-
cutta cotton hung in folds that made his
long legs seem bony

  the village awoke to evening activity
native boys driving goats to the stockade
where theyd be safe from the big cats
the steady thud-thud of women pounding
cassava in time the drums would start
for the nightly dance things never
changed

  he sat forward and watched as two
white men came in sight where the vil-
lage footpath emerged from khaya and
ironwood trees a big man and a small
man the big one striding in the lead
back of them were three natives carry-
ing bolt-action rifles

  naked boys and girls of the village
came running and stood with their bellies
sticking far out in the luassa manner to
voodoo fangs	

yiew the unexpected sight of white men
the larger of the whites paused to ask
a question and a native boy pointed with
his lower lip at yankee jims hut the
big man strode on his companion and
the rifle-carrying private askaris strung-
out behind

  he stopped seeing yankee jim looking
down on him

  bonsoir monsieur le americain

  he spoke in french but the gutteral
twist of the words showed the language
was not native to him

  the man stood with his rather short
legs set wide his trunk was thick and
powerful his head short-roached and
round there was something military in
his way of speaking but no man with
much military training would have made
his entrance with his shirt open at the
belly and his pants too low he had some-
thing in his left hand which yankee jim
now saw an oiled rhino-hide whip a
luger automatic was strapped around his
waist the other white man was insig-
nificant and spidery with a mouth of de-
caying teeth

  jim took his time in answering you
dont need your rifles in this village

  i take rifles where it pleases me the
big man answered in english his accent
was prussian or maybe polish some-
times its hard to tell

  yankee jim took a last deep drag from
the cigarette and ground it beneath the
sole of his shoe

  what are you doing visiting me or
marching on me

  the man thought it over it seemed to
take time for things to register on his
brain he decided to smile

  i was visiting yah only the friendly
visit

  then come on up

the ladder creaked under his
weight the skinny man followed
below the hired askaris crouched on their
heel bones and waited

  there was only the one chair yankee
jims and he did not bother to rise or
send the boy for others he let them stand
and leaned back the same as before study-
ing the blunt face that looked down on

him with wide grave eyes

  im yankee jim he said at last
yah for five hundred kilometers
back and forth through this sink-hole
jungle we have heard of yankee jim at
luassa village you will see white american
yankee jim this they say yankee jim
who walk even among cannibal and
poison-arrow pigmy without fear so at
last you are here

  all right who are you yankee jim
barked

  the tone made blood rise beneath the
mans oily tan he doubled his massive
pink hands licked his lips then he fought
down anger and took a deep breath yah
my name vorley hugo vorley und my
friend westland

   limey jack they call me the spidery
man said in nasal cockney grinning to
show his rotting teeth shake as you
bloomin yankees say he thrust out his
hand then let it fall when yankee jim
ignored it i say youre a difficult
bounder aint you he looked around
pretending to see the schnapps bottle for
the first time wat ave we ere fire for
the furnace

  sure have a drink

  well now thats more friendly so it
is ill just ave one i must say sport
you serve good spirits for this far in the
bush now where wrould a man be findin
old-time square bottle schnapps

  there was only the one bronze cup
limey reached for it and stopped at the
expression in yankee jims eyes jim
struck the brass gong and the bakete
boy came with two more cups he set
them down poured

  limey grabbed his and downed the
liquor vorley just stood solid and mas-
sive as before looking down on the cup
the oiled rhino whip was still rolled up
in his left hand

  yankee jim spoke your drink vor-
ley

  no tonight i am not drinking

  he said it in a certain way yankee
jim had been indolent and relaxed but
the tone made him lean forward
theres your drink

   vorley repeated raising his voice to-
night i am not drinking
	jungle

  hed been angry when he entered the
clearing jim had recognized that by his
stride it had irked him when jim ob-
jected to the armed askaris now to be
left standing while the american sat
angered him still more

  yankee jim leaned back in his chair
his eyes narrow above okume-brown
cheeks he spoke in a voice soft and
dangerous as a leopards tread

  this is my village men who visit
me here drink with me when i ask
even men who come with their own rifles
take your drink

  silence was tight-drawn from below
came the excited chatter of natives gath-
ered to look at the strange gun-bearing
tribesmen

  limey broke in with his parrot voice
lord man give me the bloomin
schnapps and ill not make an issue of
it

  shut up vorley muttered

  i only said-

  shut up vorley stood with one hand
still gripping the whip the other on the
leg of his dirty pants just below the auto-
matic he laughed with a single heavy
jerk of his shoulders ach so why
fight about schnapps he lifted the
bronze cup drank some of the liquor
remained on his lips making them look
gross and slick he wiped them off with
the back of his hand a powerful hand
fingers thick as bananas hairless pink
yah so now we have drunk schnapps
together friends we should be white
men in this land of black swine-they
should stick together not quarrel about
little things

  yankee jims face had assumed its old
lines desiccated by sun and heat leathery
expressionless only his eyes remained
alive and quick

  why did you come here

  we look for run-away boy

  and you think hes here

  somewhere in village our askaris-
they follow he was one of those killer
ncimbos

  you beat him i suppose and he ran
away -

  i give him few lashes as he deserve
mitout the whip how do native know

  yankee jim didnt answer

know you see i have men i will search
village if you not give him up to me
down below i have three askaris only

but back at mine camp-

  you have seven more

night you camped at the edge of mom-
bashi swamp yesterday you slept in the
bottoms of your canoes on the swamp of
ifabwa there you whipped another boy
for stealing an extra handful of mealie-
meal our drums keep us well posted
herr vorley as for your boy perhaps

eyes on the bakete houseboy who had
moved to the extreme corner of the ver-
andah noka hes here isnt he
noka shook his head eyes wide and
frightened

  youre hiding him bring him up
yes bwana he hid in piccinin ida

  vorley chuckled relaxed a little he
swung the coiled rhino whip against his
leg

goot i thought you would help me
white men we must stick together yah
what did he do that you lashed him
he lied the swine he lied and
would have caused us all to die me-
westland-all of us

  it took noka a couple or three minutes
the runaway boy stopped with head and
shoulders visible above the verandah
rail staring in terror at vorley

  no bwana bwana mkumbwa be
good boy me no lie

corley let the rhino whip unroll
it had a lead-weighted butt that
seemed to feel good to his hand he
was breathing more rapidly his eyes had
quickened his lips were parted showing
his small widely spaced teeth

  the boy slid over the rail fright made
his legs weak he half fell rose cringed
across the verandah eyes on vorley

  come here vorley roared you
hear me swine your bwana say come
voodoo fangs	

here his voice was like thunder

  the boy stopped he was like a rabbit
frightened to immobility by a cobra

  he was about seventeen skinny legged
charcoal black a ncimbo though not a
particularly fine specimen hed taken a
fearful beating his back was a mass of
raw flesh someone had bathed the
wounds but caked and blackened blood
still hung heavy where the lash had cut
his wrists showed where thongs had
been hed probably been lifted with toes
off the ground a heel print was left on
the floor mat blood from one of the
wounds that was still oozing

  turn around yankee jim said

  the boy obeyed

  thats enough he was still leaning
back relaxed he twisted up a cigarette
and lighted it from the goat tallow dip
vorley i have to hand it to you it
takes a strong arm to open wounds like
that

  yah vorley was flattered he flexed
his shoulder muscles and gave the rhino
whip a deft roll the tongue of it snapped
making the native boy cringe against the
wall und after the whip the salt so i
save his life otherwise the bleeding you
see-i have the mercy too his little
eyes came to rest on the schnapps bottle
he chuckled reached for it poured a slug
in the bronze cup lifted it in his thick
pink fingers to this i drink to white
man yah white man may he always
rule jungle

  put the drink down yankee jim said

  what

  put the drink down

  there was a raw edge on his voice it
jerked vorley up for a moment he stood
with legs wide drink still balanced in his
thick fingers with a movement unex-
pectedly quick yankee jim rocked for-
ward his long arm swung slapping the
cup from his fingers the schnapps flew
struck vorleys beefy face ran down his
cheeks dripped from his chin

  it took him a second to realize what
had happened he roared and started
forward yankee jim leaned back hands
resting indolently on his legs

there was a gleam of assagai metal
from the doorway leading inside a native

guard sprang into view spear leveled he
seemed about to drive the heavy iron
head through vorleys middle stopped at
the last possible instant vorley screamed
sucked in his breath weaved back his
knees were bent he almost fell

  no no the words came in a tear-
ing raw whisper from his thick throat
he backpeddled trying to keep his bal-
ance his heel caught the mattings he
went down catching himself on elbows
the assagai man moved forward keeping
the spear point close to his chest vorley
reached back got hold of the verandah
pillar rose to his feet

  the guard wasnt going to kill him he
took a great lungful of air

  ach so you have askari too

  he wiped the schnapps off his face
the whip lay at his feet he picked it up
sight of the three askaris below helped
him

  now herr yankee i will go mit my
boy

  the boy stays here

  you would keep him this boy signed
to me by-

  men dont come in this village and
argue with me not even when they bring
three rifles along not even with ten
rifles you can make it a hell of a lot
easier on yourself by remembering that

  vorleys face was dark massive shoul-
ders seemed ready to split his shirt his
pants hanging low with his belly over
them made his legs seem gorilla short
he spoke with words coming in a hiss
across his vocal cords

  he is my boy you hear that yankee
my hoy the boy i got out of chains in
chemin de fer gang mit mine own moneys
for twelve months he is mine own boy-
so say commisaire and my boy i will
take

  youre a long way from the com-
misaire now or havent you noticed

  vorley breathed deeply fighting his
rage

  so you are boss-bondele here mit
many assagai men i do not argue i ask
you think what is right what is wrong
as one white man to another you know
what this ngamo did that i lash him
listen he is of ncimbo tribe i buy his
	jungle

freedom besides pay him good coin of
belgium that he guide us to his coun-
try so what did he do lead us into
ambush for this many men not so kind
like me would cut off his legs would tear
out his tongue yah but me i use only
whip

why were you going to ncimbo 
why i have not told you a kid-
napped girl white girl the conway
girl you have heard of conways herr
yankee

  youre trying to tell me the ncimbos
kidnapped a white girl  he asked in-
credulously

  it is true as i stand here and mine
is expedition to rescue her he let the
words take effect sensing they would
change the complexion of things he
commenced feeling through the pockets
of his pants you know all white men
in this jungle yah

  he drew out an envelope damp from
sweat and bent the shape of his leg from
long carrying he laid it on the stand
a name had been written in ink but wear
and dampness had almost obliterated it
you know him perhaps

  yankee jim read the name mr james
mcgraw esq

  ill give it to him

  i could perhaps see this man-

  mcgraw he doesnt like strangers
especially strangers who carry whips and
call with their hired askaris along
ach so i go now yah

  sure go and be damned

ii

yankee jim opened the envelope a
single folded scrap of paper was in-
side excellent hand-made paper of a
type hammered out by the tireless mallets
of hindu craftsmen over in mozambique
a raised monogram in one corner c in
a circle there was barely enough light
to read

  jim

     i pray this note reaches you will
   you help all you can for my sake
   if that still means anything

                      always

                           selma

stories

  his hann closed quick and hard wad-
ding the paper his face looked leaner
bigger boned by the late evening light
he leaned forward to pour from the
schnapps bottle he lifted the bronze cup
his fingers were jumpy the natives were
staring at him

  go away he muttered

  a night breeze blew along the village
clearing carrying an odor of burning
thatch the perfume of false jasmine the
pungent-rotting night smells of the jungle
it was the first time hed noticed in a long
time the smells had become a part of
his life

  he recalled his first years in the tropics
when hed gone into the bush as resident
geologist with katanga consolidated his
life had seemed clear before him then
five years in the jungle and after hed
served his time hed graduate to one of
those gleaming two-story company
houses in elizabethville for himself and
the girl who signed herself selma on
this letter the chief stockholders daugh-
ter

  hed had his choice a mansion in
elizabethville or a hut on stilts in the
jungle

  that was one thing he hadnt figured
the jungle heat monotony whiskey
then one day hed seen the slim poly-
nesian girl standing on the wharf at
mombasa suka-hati

  he laughed a brittle savage sound
he stood and hurled the bronze cup it
struck the pillar and bounded back

  noka

  the bakete boy came from the door

  that boy from vorleys camp get
him

  yankee jim climbed down the ladder
waited for noka to come up with the
frightened ncimbo boy the ncimbo fell
to his knees grabbed yankees trouser leg

  bwana he kill he kill if me go
back-

  ill be with you

  i be your boy forever i be-

  come on

  the jungle was purplish with shadow
noisy with the sound of homing parrots
flying in flocks of hundreds through the
remote branches for a hundred meters it
voodoo fangs

was a solid growth of green with the
footpath tunnelling through then it
opened on some hummocky clearings
where women came to dig yams and
cassava

  a couple of cookfires marked the sa-
faris location there was a sentry rifle
cn his arm yankee jim spoke in the
katanga jargon and walked by him vor-
ley rose bow legged and massive with
light from the cookfire making his skin
look like oily copper

  so you bring boy

  yes hes your boy but no more
whip he raised his voice get that
no more whip

  you forget this is my safari mine
he looked at the cowering boy and his
lips twisted in  heavy satisfied smile
why you decide to come herr yankee
why bring back boy

  yankee jim did not seem to hear the
question he asked one himself

  who did you say was kidnapped
conway girl from mansion at shalo-
mar you know conways of shalomar
never heard of them

  ach your jungle is so deep you
have not heard of cobalt kings the mines
katanga

  why would the ncimbos steal a
white girl

  as hostage to keep the mining sur-
vey crews from their hill country how
would i know what damned black swine
do

  it was possible of course that was
copper and cobalt country up there and
the ncimbos were savage and clever
yankee said you went up there they
drive you back now what do you plan
perhaps mit more askaris you see
us-only fen men and of course limey
and myself to make twelve these others-
black porters coward swine but mit
thirty men-forty then perhaps they will
fear us and give girl back

  go in there with five hundred and
those ncimbos would bush -ou all but
if there really is a girl i suppose i can
get her for you

  ho vorley rubber his big hands to-
gether so perhaps good he stopped
grinning you perhaps offer this to get



half reward maybe you think you should

get paid much of conways moneys-

  i dont want a damned cent

  we are friends then yah everything
our quarrel the schnapps in face for-
gotten we will leave upriver tomorrow
morning

  well leave tonight

  yankee jim retraced his steps to the
village a lamp burning hippo grease
gave a ruddy glow to his hut suka-hati
sat crosslegged on a batik mat blowing
something that passed for melody from
a little six-pipe cheng she laid the in-
strument down and waited for him to
speak

  im going away find my leather
boots my knapsack my arab robe
yes luang

  rains and harmattan had come twice
since yankee jim had made long safari
but now at this abrupt leaving the woman
did not ask when he would be back
whether he would ever be back in some
ways a mans better off with a brown
woman

  he went inside the bedroom reached
beneath the cot took an automatic pistol
from a wrapping of grease-rags lfauser
a big forward-heavy gun one of the
old type that would fire itself empty with
a single long pull of the trigger if its
owner was man enough to hold it down

  he strapped it around his waist called
noka sent him for a crew of boat boys

it was midnight when they left
the two long dugout canoes following
the sluggish konolo through bright moon-
light with the jungle shores massive and
black on both sides

  boat boys chanted paddled with mon-
otonous choppy strokes and yankee jim
lay back lulled by the steady rock of
movement vorley sat in the stern of the
same boat asleep snoring with mouth
open the rhino whip still in his hand

  morning with the sun turning white
hot canoes hunted shade against over-
hanging jungle the river broadened un-
til current became imperceptible it was
a swamp quiet lily-grown passages in
the never-ending twilight of bowering
trees with a hundredodd monkeys chat-
	jungle

tering swinging one-armed peering down
with old-mans faces

  the swamp was apparently endless yet
a drum boomed from somewhere sending
a two-toned sound that was picked up in
the far distance by another drum

  yankee jim lay back smoking an in-
yorka cigarette he could see vorley
crawling forward around the paddlers
the drum what does it say

  how in hell would i know ask your
black boys

  they say you understand drum like

native in kindu village i hear you-

  next time youre in kindu tell them
theyre nuts no white man ever learned
the tongue of the talking drums

  they spent siesta in the canoes by
night the swamp was gigantic and gro-
tesque dawn broke over rising hills with
the rowenzori ridge vaguely visible
through mists

  it was overland thirty kilometers
through spotty forest and sudan where
grasses grew higher than a mans head
a low divide and a footpath descending
to the makura river the makura was a
hill stream cool and swift

  once again there was a message drum
a sudden sound booming on them so hard
they could feel its concussion against their
chests

  vorley cursed his porters and hired
askaris who had plunged to the protection
of bramble beside the trail if he had
fear himself his pride prevented him
showing it

he looked at yankee jim but you
know all native even ncimbos they
will not ambush mit yankee jim along
i wouldnt guarantee a damned thing
no he muttered doggedly they
will not

  the drum stopped distantly its rhythm
was picked up by another drum and
after a while the primeval silence

  they went on nobody speaking the
trail wound through deep bush crossed a
tributary stream the capito boy dropped
to one knee with a ke-ke shout of
alarm he pointed at a footprint slowly
filling with muddy water someone had
been there only minutes before

  keep going vorley muttered

stories

  the capito boys eyes were round and
frightened he stood up head shaking
backing away

  keep going vorley roared

  no

  he had the rhino whip coiled in his
hand it unwound the capito saw it
coming at the last instant he tried to hurl
himself to the earth beyond its reach the
lash snaked out and wrapped around his
neck for an instant it held like a lasso
vorley spread his legs and heaved back
snapping the boy forward the lash came
loose leaving ripped flesh that quickly
glistened with blood the boy lay face
down in the mud

  you see bellowed vorley turning
to the others once more you see what
happen to boy who disobey

  the capito was momentarily stunned
he pushed himself from the muck vor-
ley stepped back hand balancing the whip
he swung the whip around and over his
shoulder started down yankee jim had
stepped close behind him he seized the
whip next to the stock and twisted it from
vorleys hand

  vorley almost lost balance he caught
himself and spun around a curse ripped
from his throat

  yankee jim said youll not whip any-
one on this safari

  so you think to tell me vorley
you think you boss-bondele now

  he backed away hand dropping to the
butt of the luger the holster flap was
snapped shut it would have taken half a
second to free it yankee jims gun was
in an open holster vorley did not go for
his gun he let his right arm swing lax

  limey jack westland was at one side
half hidden in shoulder-high fern he
shouted one of the askaris names

  houssa

  houssa was the headman yankee jim
sensed him coming up behind a tall
high-shouldered native arms ringed with
ten pounds of brass face grotesque from
katanga tribal welts

  he spun and looked into the muzzle of
a bolt-action rifle

  the pin was back houssas smoky
brown finger was bent around the trigger
two or three seconds passed   
voodoo fangs



corleys voice he laughed
so now i am not on your veran-
dah herr yankee now you are on mine
verandah as one might say yah now
here it is i vorley who call music but
i am better host i do not throw liquor in
face it is as i say the rule i live by
white men must stick together he
breathed hard letting breath out beneath
flattened nostrils you see vorley re-
pay evil mit good

  your being scared of the ncimbos
wouldnt have anything to do with it
vorley is no coward in jungle the
white man is few the black swine many
we must stick together or all die put
down gun houssa

  they went on yankee jim taking the
lead vorley at the rear where he could
watch and prevent the flight of his na-
tives the river was swifter now filled
with swirl and foam mist hung in the
air mist rising from a cataract the
roar of it became louder

  the river fell in four steps from one
sandstone ledge to another for half a
kilo the path clung to the rocky river
marge then it narrowed and zig-zagged
to the top it was wide enough for a
single line of men

  here despite vorleys whip fear of the
ncimbos prevented the natives going on

  leave them yankee jim said and
you can stay too if i need help ill come
back after you

  so you would like to go on mitout
us

  come or stay i dont give a damn
he started up the spray-wet trail with
vorley the cockney and three of the
askaris following

  it was a long climb through the heat of
late morning he paused at the crest
vorley was still a hundred steps behind
at the base of the cascade eyes shaded
against the sun he could see ngamo the
boy vorley had half killed with his whip
back in luassa

  yankee jim paused to breathe his legs
ached pulse hammered hed had too
many years of hammock schnapps and
strong inyorka tobacco

  he looked around at the country low
mountains with knobs of granite breaking

sedimentary strata a mineral country to
his geologists eyes hed never prospect-
ed it but vorleys words about cobalt and
copper sounded plausible more plausible
by a hell of a lot than his story of a white
girl being kidnapped and held hostage by
these ncimbos who would scarcely range
as far into white mans domain as shalo-
mar a hundred kilometers to the south and
east

  in half a minute vorley puffed up the
trail and stood beside him with perspira-
tion running wet streaks down his cheeks

  and now he grunted

  jim swung a long arm indicating the
higher hills the village is over there
kamkamba if the ncimbos are holding
a girl hostage shed more likely be there
than anywhere

  and you would go inside village you
would dare do that

  ive never been very careful with my
neck maybe thats why i still have it
things work out that way sometimes

  and maybe too chief is friend of
yours 

  yankee jim started on without bother-
ing to answer

ill

the trail was still steep and nar-
row cut from rock as it circled the
hillside it widened unexpectedly and
there was a small clearing the air flut-
tered and an arrow dug dirt from the path
ahead

  vorley leaped back cursing hand com-
ing up with the luger

  put it away yankee jim said

  you think i should maybe-

  put it away or the next arrow will be
through your guts

  yah

  vorley rammed the gun back in its
holster there was still no one in sight
just the sunlit open space covered by
knee-high orchilla the green surrounding
wall of thorn no leaf trembling

  yankee jim took his time he was like
a man whod stumbled into a cobras nest
and realized the danger of any abrupt
movement he turned stretched his arms
to indicate they were far from his gun
	jungle

and lifted fingers in a tribal sign fifteen
or twenty seconds passed the heat and
fly-drone of late morning seemed to press
in on them seeming to accentuate the still-
ness then there was movement a tremble
of orchilla leaves

  a man stood up only a dozen paces
away a skinny old native with a tribal-
scarred neck and heavy earrings of copper
he was holding a short-bow and a notched
arrow

  a second native got up to the right a
third to the left then they rose from
every side eight of them in all

  the skinny native their headman came
forward tapping a bit of white cowrie
shell in his necklace to signify friendship

  bwana yankee he said

  yankee jim answered in the ncimbo
dialect asking for na-pemo king of the
village

  na-pemo would be there the drumsi
had told him of bwana yankees approach
the headman made this known by a com-
bination of congo jargon and sign lan-
guage choosing to show off his knowl-
edge of this rather than use the dialect of
his own people which jim understood well
enough however the other bondeles and
their askaris must stay behind they would
be safe below the waterfall

  what does he say vorleys eyes
were small and suspicious in the midst of
his vast face what does black savage
say about chief na-pemo

  the chief will welcome me-alone

  and me i should stay here like cow-
ard 

  youll have to wait below the water-
falls

  vorley planted himself on his short
bowed legs hands on hips the whip as
always coiled in his hand he laughed a
sound from deep in his throat the askaris
watched him rifles still in their hands
limey jack had cowered back as close to
the thorn as he dared with the ncimbo
warriors watching

  ach so i am to wait here while you
bring girl out alone and when pray
gott will it be i see you again i should
meet you maybe in elizabethville

  all right dont trust me but what
choice do you have

stories

  this choice p

  hed backed a step getting himself in
the clear his wrist moved uncoiling the
whip it swung quick as the dart of a
mamba-snake

  the lash wound itself around the head-
mans neck

  the native started to scream the lash
choked it off he dropped the bow and
arrow reached up to claw with his fin-
gers vorley swung back with strength
that jerked the small man from his feet
he let go the whip at the same instant
caught the native and drew him close with
forearm locked beneath his chin held him
close using his writhing body for protec-
tion

  his right hand came up weighted with
the luger it hammered in a machine-
gun series of concussions

  the whole thing took place with in-
stantaneous rapidity the whip the flying
body of the native the closely spaced ex-
plosions three of the ncimbo guards
were down from flying bullet lead askaris
dived for cover rifles blasting in a volley
that blended with the luger

  yankee jim turned on vorley jerking
the mauser from its holster his brain
seemed to explode there were blank
seconds and he came to himself with
earth and trampled orchilla weeds beneath
him vaguely realizing that limey had
slugged him from behind

  he got to hands and knees one gun
was still hammering air filled with the
sharp odor of cordite he saw houssa
the head askari striding across the clear-
ing rifle leveled breast high houssa
stopped hesitated the rifle jumped in his
hands one of the wounded natives had
evidently been crawling off in cover of
weeds

  vorley laughed he was standing with
the skinny headman still held close the
luger leveled with its barrel across his
naked side

  so that is all all but one

  vorley suddenly released the headman
the fellow staggered away vorley booted
him with the flat of his foot sending him
sprawling face down he rolled over and
stared at the leveled luger

  yankee jim reeled to his feet vorley
voodoo fangs



the gun pounded making a
flat dead sound on the late morning
heat the native had been trying to get
up the bullet struck and drove him back
it passed all the way through his bony
frame and raised dust from the pathway
beyond his left shoulder it must have
missed his heart for he threshed for a
dozen seconds before the shudder of death
passed through him

  ho vorley -chortled like chicken
mitout head

  yankee jim was on his feet pain from
the blow hed received seemed to be split-
ting his brain down the center his hand
felt for the mauser it was gone he
looked for it on the ground

  right ere sport limey jack said
slapping his belt where the mauser was
thrust in his hand was a heavy webley
revolver just stop where you are
vorley walked over to nudge a couple
of the fallen natives with his toe he
grunted satisfaction put away the luger
turned to face yankee jim

  so you thought me the fool you
thought to leave me behind while you went
to village and got girl and took her in
alone to collect reward moneys maybe
you thought to keep girl too for your-
self when you see how young she is how
white and soft but you see vorley is not
so big the fool

  yankee jim let a laugh jerk from his
throat he flipped one hand to indicate
the dead natives sprawled in orchilla weed

  how do you expect to stay alive in this
country after word of your slaughter gets
to kamkamba

  but i will get to kamkamba first i
will have the girl and be far away before
they know and you will help me do it
herr yankee

  youd have the guts to enter kam-
kamba now

  they will not kill me while you are
along i know that when i see how they
love you these native swine

  what would keep me from telling
what youd done

  ho they would kill me but they
would kill you too for bringing me and
perhaps the girl did i not say vorley
was smart man

  vorley picked up the rhino whip drew
it beneath one sweaty armpit to wipe away
the dirt and leaf fragments that clung to
its oiled surface he tested its balance let
the lash roll out and pop like a small-
calibre gunshot

  he jerked his head in command take
him

  the askaris came up one on each side
of yankee jim one of them grabbed an
arm jim jerked himself free

  easy sport the cockney stepped
closer thumb rocking the hammer of the
webley revolver id mind the boss-bon-
dele now i would itll be easier for you
im tellin you that as one english-speakin
white man to another just lift your ands
before i ave to bend this barrel over your
cronk again

  yankee jim lifted his arms it would
be useless trying to fight them all hed
best take it vorley wouldnt dare kill him
not yet there was a grim smile on his
lips hed spent half his life in the tropics
and had never felt a whiplash every man
should be lashed at least once in order to
make his jungle experience complete

  you see something funny herr yan-
kee 

  go ahead get it over with

  yah so i will i will let you now see
what happen to man who throw chnapps
in face

  he swung the whip it seemed to be an
easy movement using only a part of his
strength in that it was deceptive the
lash gathered speed to its moment of im-
pact and struck with the pain of a white-
hot wire ripping the white cotton coat
and shirt that covered yankee jims shoul-
ders

  vorley took his time and swung again
again the exertion had increased his
breathing he gave a little satisfied grunt
with each swing of his body and wheezed
a few times afterward

  yankee jim took the blows making no
sound his teeth were set his arms were
wide with one of the askaris holding each
of them perspiration sprang to his fore-
head and ran down his lean leathery
cheeks his coat and shirt had been
chewed to strips by the lash streaked with
bloody
	jungle

  so vorley stopped and breathed
heavily a while so much for one debt
so much for throwing schnapps in face
now for trying to cheat me of reward
moneys i will give you perhaps six more
yankee jim was dizzy from pain each
time the lash seemed to take something
out of him it made his knees that much
nearer to collapsing the scream of pain
that much closer to coming from his
throat

  the whip came down again again vor-
ley moved back using his forearm to wipe
sweat from his face

  you still like mine whip you should
see back herr yankee you should see
how stripes run down from shoulder-
blades and meet over spine sometimes
perhaps when vorley has more time he
would make you cry mercy herr vor-
ley enough like so

  id see you in hell first

  so you say so many men say but it
is different when flesh comes loose from
bone he coiled the whip and rolled his
sleeve back down but i must congratu-
late you you take twelve stripes and
make no sound mit native near that is
goot white man must prove himself su-
perior

  strength had returned quickly to yan-
kee jims lean-hard body

  youre quite a fellow vorley

  he might have been at home sitting in
the shade of his own verandah from all
one could tell by his voice

 yah i am not fellow to throw
schnapps in face

  flies were there in swarms called by
the warm smell of blood yankee jim
stripped off his shirt and reversed it in
order to cover the deep whip gashes it
was the best he could do for the moment
later with good fortune hed be able to
get palm oil and a soft pad of bark cloth
at the village

  now to village vorley asked

  yes its ten kilometers well have to
travel through siesta to get there before
they find out about this he motioned at
the fallen natives

  fear narrowed vorleys eyes you

think-

  there have been no drums

stories

  he exhaled reassured but still suspi-
cious it was true that vorley was no fool
he was wary the lashing had helped his
pride but he still hated yankee jim and
feared him he would let jim live only as
long as his help was a necessity that
meant only until he could get the girl to
the edge of ncimbo country beyond the
cascades

the rising heat of afternoon
made travel difficult they moved
slowly keeping to the shade of thorn and
spottily growing hardwoods jim had
been over the trail before hed expected
the sentries above the cascades there
would be no others short of the village
clearing

  they walked through huge african teak
shading a saucer shaped basin the tim-
ber ended and they paused at the edge of
a clearing a kilometer distant and
slightly below lay a village built more
after the style of a zulu kraal than the
single-street bantu village prevalent in the
congo

  the huts were round structures of
hardwood bamboo and palm thatch a
stockade of pointed pickets surrounded
the village there were little irregular
plots of millet and yams

  heat waves of late afternoon gave
things a shimmering quality that prevented
them telling whether the open gate was
guarded

  vorley looked obstinate and suspicious
as he stood hunched forward looking at
the village with narrowed eyes

  yankee jim said theres no point in
waiting his lips peeled back in a grin
or have your guts turned yellow

  vorley no coward

  ive heard you say that before what
if they wont give up the girl

  vorley slapped the luger

  yankee jim laughed there are a hun-
dred assagai-men in that village theyd
let you shoot that thing dry and then run
you through like pork on a spit just who
is the girl youre after

  i told you the conway girl beyond
that i do not know the conways are
great people in big house they do not
invite me to tiffin herr yankee only to
voodoo fangs

save lives am i good enough

  yankee jim knew there was no use try-
ing to get anything out of him if there
was a girl hed find out once in the vil-
lage

  the footpath followed a rude dike used
for holding irrigation water then it cut
through some feathery-topped papayas and
crossed a hundred meters of grassless
earth to the stockade gate

  the village slept in late-siesta sun for
a moment it seemed that no one even no-
ticed their approach but a drum started
muttering a message drum constructed
of hollowed tree trunk being beaten with
padded sticks and not intended to be heard
much beyond the village clearing

  yankee jim stopped just inside the open
stockade gate a warrior with ocre and
white clay freshly smeared on face and
chest met him a big fellow unusually
well formed for a ncimbo who were in-
clined to be stringy-tough

  he lifted his assagai keeping it point
down in a signal of peace

  bwana yankee you come as talking
drum say

  yankee jim slapped the holster at his
waist to indicate it no longer contained a
pistol it was customary to leave ones
weapons behind on visiting most of these
hill-country villages

  the assagai-man turned to block vor-
leys way

  only bwana-yankee

  me-baminga vorley pointed at

his heart at heaven and gave the sign of
peace

  the assagai-man stared at vorleys lu-
ger reluctantly vorley unbuckled the
holster belt and let it fall to the red-baked
earth of the path

  baminga muttered yankee jim

  the assagai-man stood at one side let-
ting vorley go by limey jack and the
askaris were still outside

  unstrap your gun vorley said

  im all right out ere limey chat-
tered me ill stay with the niggers
and---

  unstrap your gun coward swine

limey jack did so his skinny fingers
shook as he fumbled with the buckle he

-jungle-winter



tried to grin but succeeded only in look-
ing like a mummy whose lips had shrunk-
en away from his teeth

  they walked across the central square
the three white men with an ever-growing
crowd of natives around them

  a girot was squatting on his heels beat-
ing a message drum with two mallets
keeping track of their progress relaying
word of it to the chiefs hut where old
na-pemo would be waiting in state be-
fitting a call from yankee jim beyond
the girot was the inevitable mud-plastered
fetish hut a little forest of pointed
stakes had grown up around the huts
doorway each stake with a white skull set
atop it in memory of an individual act of
cannibalism to many tribes of the deep-
er congo it is not sufficient that an enemy
be slain but his flesh must be consumed
as a final symbol of conquest

  hungry yankee jim asked over his
shoulder

  vorley spat you have poor sense of
humor herr yankee

  as jim walked his back burned as
though hed been branded by a red iron
sometimes perspiration would work down
between his shoulders and the itch of it
was like added fire for the last five kilo-
meters every movement had been torture
but there was no indication of that on his
lean face

  na-pemos hut was a big one with three
centerpoles its form remindful of a show
tent back in america the entrance was
low covered by a robe of antelope skin
jim lifted it and went inside with vorley
and limey jack staying close behind

iv

inside it was windowless and hot
after a few seconds things became
visible na-pemo was seated on a mound
of palm mats and bark cloth crosslegged
elbows supported by rests of polished horn
he was naked to the waist his loins and
legs were covered by a piece of red and
blue batik each arm carried fifteen or
twenty pounds of copper bracelet and for
that reason the arm rests were necessary
crudely fashioned chains were strung
around his neck half covering his chest
	jungle

the lobes of his ears were pulled down like
ribbons by the weight of copper earrings
he was fifty or fifty-five as closely as
anyone could guess the age of a hill-coun-
try native and his skin had the charcoal
duskiness of all his tribe

  yankee-nibo he said calling jim

king and thus placing them on an equal
social level he accepted the presence of
vorley and limey jack without question
as though they were yankee jims servants

  yankee jim stepped atop the mound of
palm mats his hand came from his pocket
holding a folded machete he laid it on
one of na-pemos knees na-pemo ac-
knowledged the gift with a smile that
showed his teeth the two front ones gone
hammered out as a charm against sorcery
the others turned red-black from betel nut
chewing

  na-pemo slapped one hand on his batik
robe and a naked slave woman shuffled
from one of the huts dim recesses carry-
ing an earthen jug of millet beer on her
shoulder she squatted poured a portion
in each of two huge copper cups the
cups were so heavy a man needed both
hands when drinking

  you honor my village na-pemo said

  i have come looking for the bondele-
girl

  no change on the chiefs expression
no indication whether a white girl was
really held prisoner there was a possi-
bility of course that she was being held
in some other village these ncimbos
controlled a wedge of unexplored country
running to the misty summits of the row-
enzori ridge

  the beer was sour with a raw tinge of
fermentation still in it a gallon of it
would lack the alcoholic content of a single
two-finger slug of schnapps

  after the beer other slave women ap-
peared first with fruits-bananas pa-
payas and little scarlet mangoes intensely
sweet and no larger than plums next
came a course of brittle-baked millet cakes
yams in honey a sort of dry-shredded
breadfruit

  the men ate vorley had been left
standing for half an hour his face kept
looking darker and more massive as anger
grew on him he muttered something and

stories

started forward

  sit down yankee jim growled at
him

  vorley hesitated jim went on speak-
ing english which the chief did not un-
derstand

  dont make any mistakes anybody
coming inside a ncimbo village is hang-
ing over a cliff by his teeth

  but if they find men back by water-
fall-

  you should have thought of that be-
fore you cut loose with the luger now
well have to play it out if this fellow
knows about the girl hell tell it at hisi
own damned leisure if you try to force
things youll be a lot more likely to end
up with an assagai in your guts than me
vorley moved back and sank slowly to
a heap of palm mats by the wall his hand
moved along the belt where his luger had
been it bothered him to be without it
the whip was still coiled in his left hand
however and there was satisfaction in
that he gripped it hard watched yankee
jim and the native as they ate through one
dish after another

  the sun was low it found little holes
in the bamboo walls sending through nar-
row strips of light the village was awake
filled with the usual evening sounds the
same sounds jim might be listening to if
he were back on his verandah in loussa
sounds of cooking of women of stones
pounding millet

  the slave woman came with a cockrel
roasted ncimbo style without its entrails
removed

  twilight now and almost dark inside
the hut a crippled little black hobbled
in carrying a grease lamp its light was
lost in the vastness of the big hut

  vorley had fought off impatience as long
as he could

  yankee-swine you think we have

forever you think-

  keep your tongue still

  the exchange seemed to remind na-
pemo of the question yankee jim had
long before put to him he dried chicken
fat from his fingers on a wisp of thatch
and said

  you want bondele-woman

  she was alive then none of the relief
voodoo fangs



 yankee jim felt was reflected on his face
 it was as thin and hard-lined as ever

   yes i want bondele-woman

  you-my baminga you owner of

 my life no-pemo was referring to the
 fact that yankee jim had saved his
 younger brothers life in an ambush laid
 by the nebos five years before and for
 that reason he could refuse nothing

   na-pemo called an assagai-man rattled
 off a command and sent him away they
 waited while darkness came more deeply
 giving an added brightness to the lamp

  na-pemo made no explanation he
 didnt tell how the girl had been taken or
 why the talking drums had kept na-
 pemo aware of yankee jims approach he
 must have guessed the reason for his
 safari and had already decided to give
 her up

the assagai- man came back
someone was with him a girl she
looked small and frightened head and
shoulders draped with a batik-cloth robe
her back was toward yankee jim vorley
had started to rise from his place against
the wall he was staring up at her
crouched forward one hand touching the
floor she saw him and started back a
scream forming in her throat

   she retreated spun around to look at
 the chief she would have gone to the na-
 tive for protection from vorley for the
 first time yankee jim saw her face

   he sprang to his feet selma

   it was impossible a girl couldnt look
 exactly the same after almost twenty
 years twenty years in the tropics is
 often the difference between youth and
 age he remembered how selma had
 looked the first time hed seen her at that
 costume ball on the terrace of the rand
 club down in lourenco marques she
 was no older there was the same glossy
 hair with a tinge of red in it the same
 hazel eyes the small nose and short upper
 lip the same lovely curves of her small
 slim body

   selma he repeated

   she didnt recognize him he realized
 he was being a fool this girl was not

never known the name of the man selma
had married hed only known that it was
all over between them after hed taken up
with the polynesian girl over in mombasa
this must be selmas daughter this was
the girl shed asked hiirf to help in the
brief note vorley had delivered to the
verandah in luassa

  you wont be harmed yankee jim
said sinking back to his old place beside
na-pemo

  dont let them take me 

  she was referring to vorley and limey
jack vorley had paused a couple of steps
away he was looking at her eyes alive
and greedy above his flat cheeks his lips
slightly parted showing his small stained
teeth

  yankee tim said dont be afraid of
him

  herr yankee-swine you think now you
have vorley helpless that you will take
woman and leave vorley mit head on stake
by voodoo house you think this

  vorley was only a step away the girl
kept moving away from him the assagai-
man thinking she might escape seized her
arms from behind

 the expression on vorleys face
alarmed chief na-pemo he got to his
feet copper bracelets clattering he start-
ed to say something

  the whip had been coiled in vorleys
hand he swung it it wrapped itself
around the chiefs neck

  vorley swung back with all the massive
strength of his body na-pemo was a
thin man no longer young his bones
were brittle the sharp crack of a verte-
brae could be heard through the hut

  he struck the floor face down bounded
skidded limp to vorleys feet vorley
knew the jerk had snapped his neck like
the drop from a gallows he let the whip
go loose its lash unwind

  it had all happened with instantaneous
quickness while yankee jim was rising
to his feet the assagai-man let go the
girl and reached for his copper-headed
spear swung around vorley had antici-
pated the move hed switched hands
with the whip swung it by the lash its
lead-weighted butt slamming the guards
skull and driving him like dead weight to

stories

the ground

  yankee jim sprang from the heap of
matting and bark cloth and was on vor-
leys shoulders

  vorley had glimpsed him at the last
moment he was quick superbly power-
ful with a twisting movement and a
snap of his shoulders he dumped yankee
jim to the earth

  the whip came around aimed for the
head but jim rolled and took only a
glancing blow

  he reeled to his feet

  vorley was backing away eyes darting
to the black-shadowed depths of the hut
to the skin-draped front entrance for
the moment no alarm for the moment
safety voodoo drums just starting to
beat getting mood for the evening dance

  he glanced around for the girl she
was backing away she didnt see limey
jack limey seized her drew her arms
behind her she fought started to scream
he dropped one arm clamped a hand
across her mouth muffling the sound

  yankee jim was advancing trying to
watch both men vorley backed away
whip still held by the lash the butt swing-
ing back and forth

 no yankee-swine-you hear me

stay away you fight and they will come
they will capture us all here mit chief
dead then will we all die me you limey
jack all our skulls boiled mitout flesh
and stuck on pointed stakes by voodoo
hut girls skull too all white in jungle
sun on pointed sticks for thousand years

  the assagai had fallen to the ground
vorley picked it up the girl was strug-
gling eyes protruding face turning dark
fingers clawing at the cockneys hand

yankee jim stopped it was

true he didnt dare fight with vor-
ley the alarm would go up and theyd
be found with the murdered chief after-
ward death by torture their skulls on
pointed sticks as vorley had said

  jim hissed at the girl stop fighting-
you hear me stop fighting

  she obeyed him

  its the only way youll stand a
chance of getting away after dark if there
isnt an alarm ill stay here until youre

safe beyond the stockade

  ho a chuckle sounded in vorleys
thick throat so a hero yah you will
stay and we will go now it is vorley who
have girl to himself not as you plan back
by waterfall it will be vorley who collect
moneys for reward---if so i choose

  damn you get going but ill be
along on your trail and no harm had
better come to the girl

  vorley didnt like the sound of the
words he backed toward shadow whip
in one hand assagai in the other the cor-
ners of his heavy mouth twisted down
with an unexpected movement he pivoted
and flung the assagai its copper head
flashed in candleflame and fanned air
close to yankee jims cheek there was a
dry breaking sound as it drove through
the bamboo wall alarmed voices rose in
a chorus from the village street outside

  yankee jim cursed him he strode to

the entrance-reached it just in time

a young warrior rammed him

  jim moved on dropping the drape ap-
parently not noticing the warriors leveled
assagai

 ay-obwa jim said nothing
wrong

  the warrior still wanted to push past

  baminga jim grinned touching the
white friendship bead midway on the na-
tives multi-colored necklace

  it was an easy voice--a familiar
word they combined to reassure the
strong young fellow he gave ground low-
ering the point of his assagai a few de-
grees

  only a slight evening glow remained in
the sky darkness would be dense along
the stockade and this diversion would
help other natives were gathering around
an old man hobbled up carrying the as-
sagai that had passed through the wall a
fire burning by the fetish hut cast light
that brightened and dimmed gleaming
from oiled bodies and copper ornaments
the thicket of skulls on pointed posts
looked yellow-white

  the old man shook the assagai and
chattered half-intelligibly in the ncimbo
tongue pointing toward the wall through
which it had emerged

  ay-obwa yankee jim repeated

  he felt in his pockets generally he
had a few trinkets for gifts but this time
all he could find were five mauser shells
he passed them around ay-obwa he
kept repeating

  a big guardsman came pushing through
moving men aside with the shaft of his
assagai he was the same guardsman who
had met them at the outer gate that after-
noon he was peering at yankee jim
eyes narrow and suspicious

  jim faced him banting a

  bamvnga the guard repeated but
after hesitating to touch the friendship
bead on his neck be walked on toward
the door assagai pointed hip high

  the game was about up yankee jim
tried to estimate the amount of time that
had passed a minute maybe it was
long enough only eighty or a hundred
paces separated the rear of the hut from
the stockade vorley would have the girl
over by now hed be in the shadow of
those papaya trees now it was time for
yankee jim to think about saving his own
hide hed have to get out alive for the
girls sake besides there were still half
a hundred litres of that old-time square-
bottle schnapps in luassa and he had a
desire to drink it before surrendering to
heat and jungle fever

  the guardsman was going to force his
way by jim would have to go in with
him theyd be alone for a few seconds
it would be his best his only chance

  he moved aside to let the guardsman
pass

  from inside rose thescream of a slave
woman

  jim spun started inside the hut the
guardsman seemed to anticipate the move
he turned with the spear aiming the flat
side of it at yankee jims head

  a glancing blow jim was still on his
feet but the ground seemed to be slanting
under him he tried to reach the door
instead he rammed the bamboo wall

  men were on every side he battered
them off he was trying to get up the
door nowhere around no safety inside
anyway

  men were dragging him  he still
fought the torture of vorleys whip had

 stories

weakened him he was tired he stopped
rested on one knee while natives held
both arms

   sounds came to his ears they were
 wailing inside slave women theyd be
 slashing their veins and rolling across the
 floor mattings to show anguish for their
 master more voices slave womens wail-
 ing drowned out a high-pitched ke-ke-ke
 of voodoo death chant asserted itself

v

fatigue rendered yankee jim half
conscious when realization came
he was lying on his back arms stretched
wide wrists bound to piece of timber not
unlike a crucifix

  drums were beating-tom-toms of a

 dozen sizes all throbbing the rhythm of
 the black dance

   he twisted from side to side thick
 oil-tanmed thongs had been wrapped
 around and around bis wrists no chance
 of breaking free

he lay on his back eyes closed feeling

 the drums-the jolt of their vibration

 across the earth by minute degrees the
 tempo was mounting rising and falling
 with the drums came the wild vengeful
 chant of natives

   he knew what would happen next the
 tempo would suddenly change and they
 would come over for him lift the crucifix
  to which he was tied and carry it to the
 fire and stand it there they would dance
 more wildly then with each warrior find-
 ing bits of thatch to throw at his feet un-
 til the heap had grown waist high it
 might take till midnight till next morn-
 ing or noon finally when they were
 ready fetish priests in black masks would
 come from the voodoo hut and poke a
 burning stick into the heap the stick
 would burn closer and closer and that
 wtould be the real torture--watching
 dreading the flame at last after an etern-
 ity a shaving or thatch blade would catch
 and spread around him after that the
 end would be quick

   he opened his eyes two guardsmen
 stood nearby both carried assagais both
 watched the dance with hypnotized eyes

he twisted at the bonds harder than
voodoo fangs



before he made a quick movement and
one of the guards glanced around he
turned bent over looked to see that the
knots were still tight

  yankee jim smiled back grimly he let
himself relax

  the tropic stars were bright and close
now that the rains were gone and harmat-
tan had not brought its yellow haze of
dust from the far saharah he was lying
by the wall of na-pemos big hut its
overhanging thatch eave made a ragged
cut across the night sky

  the drums beat on-deep boom of

rhino hide the middle range of antelope
the staccato of monkey skin the sound
seemed to rise and fall numbing the
senses

  he lay still a man could be hypno-
tized even killed by the booming of drums
it seemed hours since hed struggled with
the thongs he tried again feeling had
left his hands he rocked from one shoul-
der to the other and the movement
brought pain once more to life on his
whip-cut back

  bwana mkumbzm

  the voice was close to him he rolled
his head trying to see assay ai-gudxs
still there no one else he started to an-
swer paused licked his lips the voice
had been familiar a second and he re-
membered ngamo thats who it was-
ngamo the boy whom vorley had beaten
half to death in luassa village hed left
him behind at the waterfall the boy had
followed this was his home village--
kamkamba it had been easy for him
hed said back in luassa village that he
would be yankee jims boy forever but
often such native promises didnt mean
much

  you be still bwana mkumbwa

  yankee jims lips pulled away from his
teeth in something like a grin

  the wall trembled a little he knew then
where the boy was hes entered the hut
found the spot exactly above yankee
jims head and was pulling the bamboo
slats apart

  an arm appeared light from the fire
gleamed along a machete blade it was a
long reach yankee jim could feel the

sharp steel as it slid between his wrist
and the plank to which it was bound a
sharp twist and the machetes keen edge
bit through thong

  there was scarcely a sensation of being
free hed been bound too tightly-for
too long he drew his hand an inch or
so opened and closed his fingers lie didnt
risk any more

  the other hand was too far he could
hear ngamo making a new opening it
was hard lying still now that escape was
so close the araraz-guards were only a
couple of steps away back partly turned
bodies oiled and gleaming by firelight

  the machete again this time it took a
moment of sawing to sever the final wrap-
pings

  yankee jim was free the arm moved
out of sight leaving machete stabbed in
earth he forced himself to lie still for
a few seconds yet hed have to give
the boy his chance to get away

  he drew one arm in then the other
slowly the guards did not see sitting
up was another series of slow movements
no movement abrupt the machete was
in his hand

  he located the door to the hut it was
around a curve in the wall

  he stood one of the guards looked
not startled it took him a fraction of
time to realize the man was his bondele
prisoner

  the guard uttered a sharp cry lifted his
assagai let drive

  jim was too close he batted the shaft
to one side it smashed through one of
the main supports of the wall the guard
tried to retrieve but it stuck fast

  yankee jim hurtled the shaft he ran
taking long strides spears and arrows
whisked past he stayed close to the wall
and shadow hid him he saw the rear
door to tbe hut ducked inside dark he
still ran trusting his memory

  no one near the front door he stood
still as natives ran past he left the hut
walking a running man would be no-
ticed sixty or seventy meters to the stock-
ade drums still beating and hypnotized
natives still danced around the fire he
wedged a foot between two stockade posts
swung over the sharpened tops dropped to

stories

the ground outside

  there was a stretch of open ground
bright with moonlight then the blessed
darkness of jungle night

yankee jim had been traveling at
an easy swinging stride that cover
kilometer after kilometer of jungle foot-
path he stopped among high laguna
trees

  in the distance drums were beating
tom-toms in the village they would
beat on for days even weeks in mourn-
ing for na-pemo there was another
sound the two-toned voice of a message
drum

  hed told vorley only a half truth in
saying no white man evfer learned the
tongue of the drums after twenty years
in the deep congo a man gets to be more
native than white he gets so hearing the
drums makes pictures in his mind it is
not a code that the drummer sends-none
of your white mans dots and dashes it
is infinitely more subtle his deft manipu-
lations of high and low tones become
blended into something that actually ap-
proximates the speech of man

  tonight the drums had a particular sig-
nificance for yankee jim because they
were speaking his name and the name of
noka bondele-that would be vorley

  jim went on through moonlight through
forest shadow past dead warriors lying in
orchilla weeds down the spray-wet steps
of the waterfall

 a drum now from downriver that
would be sending messages back to kam-
kamba varley and the girl they had
gone that way the drum said more that
yankee jim could not catch

  vorley would be heading overland
where canoes waited at tbe swamp of
ifabwa no tracing him once he reached
the swamp-not through that limitless mo-
rass

  thirty kilometers there was a chance
varley could make it before the heat of
afternoon forced a pause of course the
girl would complicate things that gave
jim a chance

  he turned south across rising grassland
another two hours of travel the drums
again this time from a new direction
voodoo fangs



the big bondele had turned west mbini
that would be the ancient footpath from
fumbrio pass to mbini village

  he found the place where the footpath
forked west marked by a dark line through
head-deep savannah grass before it
plunged into black jungle

  travel had long ago deadened yankee
jims muscles he kept traveling auto
matically fatigue had settled like opiate
through him

  the path was utterly black with no ray
of starlight finding its way through the
hundred-foot sponge of leaf and vine in-
stinct the echo of his own movements
these things guided him along its bend-
ing course

  a root he fell once on the ground
he realized how tired he was he sat up
fumbled through his pockets found to-
bacco pouch papers a chemi-dry box of
matches

  fine leaf had accumulated in the bot-
tom of the pouch it was mostly bangh
which natives blend with tobacco to put
an extra punch in the already strong in-
yorka he twisted up a cigarette lighted
it inhaled in deep drags

  yankee jim had known the day when
he could travel from night till morning
then eat and travel again but thered
been too many square bottle of schnapps
too many days in the hammock too many
years of jungle fever

  the bangh gave him new strength a
drum he sat up surprised by the un-
expected loudness of it it seemed to
beat almost at his elbow sound carried
clearly along the footpath

  the drum said something about big
bondele something about rosha village

  the roshas undersize scavenger
tribesmen who frequented the deep jungle
many years ago hed stopped in a rosha
village near there and the scrawny blacks
had first fled to the bush and later re-
turned to wait on him in a servile dog-
like manner

  vorley would seek out such a place
hed heard the drums hed be trying
to escape them hed feel secure in such
a jungle clearing away from the main
footpath

	jungle

  yankee jim went on a couple of kilo-
meters the footpath widened a na-
tive village had stood there long before
elephant grass grew high across the old
cassava patch some nut and raffia palms
resisted the parasitic vines of the encroach-
ing jungle

  he stopped trying to remember the
opening was nearby but things looked
different by night at last he located the
narrow side path it descended to a muddy
stream climbed the other side a man
had to look out for crocs after night in
places like that drums once more he
recognized his own name in its beating
the drummer had been crounched unseen
by the footpath or he had a girot as
eyes for him half a minute and the
message would be relayed to kamkamba
an explorer with the oxford foundation
once told him the drums could relay a
message from the cameroons to kenya
coast across the waist of africa in three
hours

  it was farther than he expected to
rosha village morning was a hint of
gray over high hardwood trees a tiny
clearing with bare earth looked like
snow in mixed dawn and starlight sur-
rounding the clearing were dome shaped
huts that looked like mere piles of thatch

  he looked at the village from a distance
of a couple of hundred meters across a
little half-stagnant stream

  no sound or movement he descended
waded knee-deep through muck and
water started up the other bank fresh
dampness made dark spots on the earth
he dropped to one knee the dampness
had been left by a mans feet someone
had crossed the stream less than half an
hour before

  he stood up apparently as tall and
careless as ever but there was a catlike
wariness in his step he drew the ma-
chete a blade of arabian steel native-
mounted in wooden handles

someone would be waiting along
the path maybe a rosha sentry and
if so jim did not want to harm him it
might be vorley-or the cockney

  he took two more steps a strip of
moonlight cut the pathway an ambusher

stories

would wait for him there

  yankee jim twisted unexpectedly to
one side he anticipated movement
there was none

  jims eyes long used to darkness made
out a branch lying across the footpath
knee high it had been placed there
hed been too long in the tropics not to
recognize the trigger pole of a deadfall
farther on a small tree trunk had been
bowed back

  yankee jim stepped over the trigger
pole movement in the shadow close
moonlight glimmered on knife steel

  a man in whites rose close ahead of
him hed been crouching under the vines
limey jack

  jim seized his wrist

  limey jack was not heavy but fear
gave him a sudden madmans strength
he twisted aside trying to free his wrist
his heel slipped on rotting deadwood
his weight helped and his wrist slipped
from jims grasp

  darkness and jungle tangle hid limey
for an instant he was crawling downhill
like a terrified lizard

  jim bent grabbed his collar he could
have killed limey with a swing of his
machette eh didnt he trod on the
mans knife-wrist twisted the collar in a
choke-hold he didnt want limey dead
-he wanted him to talk to tell where
vorley had taken the girl

  his finger twisted the collar tighter
limeys breath rattled through his tor-
tured throat

  where are they whats vorley done
with her

  limey was flat eyes distended his
mouth was open trying to say some-
thing jim relaxed his hold limeys
head darted with a feline movement his
teeth sank in yankee jims wrist

  sudden pain made jim let go limey
writhed away sprang to his feet he ran
uphill for the moment fear of jim
had made him forget the trigger he
tried to stop at the last instant a scream
ripped from his throat he flung his
shoulders back arms high but bent knees
touched the branch

  the bent trunk was released like a
mighty bow there was a roar of air the
voodoo fangs



thud of a machete driving through bone
and flesh

  limey jack was still upright held there
on limp knees by a machete driven
through his chest it had been bound to
the small tree trunk which -was bowed back
and held by thong and notch-trigger that
the merest touch would dislodge

  jim touched his body he swung to
and fro with the sway of the tree dead

  a girls voice startled the air her cry
was cut abruptly

  it had come from the village

  yankee jim climbed the trail no move-
ment in the village clearing those cow-
ard rosha natives would probably be
skulking in jungle shadow a man had
to be careful of them cowards are al-
ways most dangerous he didnt want
a poisoned arrow in the back 

  jim circled the clearing keeping to the
screen of parasitic vines hanging from
wide branches of khaya trees

  he almost stumbled over a native the
man hopped to his feet like a gila mon-
key but yankee jim seized him by his
top-knot flinging him to his buttocks
the rosha weighed scarcely a hundred
pounds

  big bondelet yankee asked

  the rosha knew what he meant jim
pulled him to his feet the rosha kept
making affirmative signs with his head
led him through skeins of vine along- a
path where branches arched so close jim
was forced to bend double

  they entered a smaller clearing where
a cluster of miserabfe huts had been built
dried thatch looked moldy gray

  kay-aht jim asked in congo jargon-

  the rocha understood pointed out the
largest of the huts jim released him it
was a dozen strides to the hut

  the hut doorway was low jim bent
over stepped quickly inside he moved
along the wall stopped

dark no sound or movement the
hut was close from the stale-strong
odor of rotting thatch and uncured skins
and another odor the sweaty oily odor
of vorleys body

  he stood with shoulders touching the

wall machete in hand

  the girl screamed

  he set himself for the impact of vor-
leys body instead a weight smashed
him to the earth

  the heavy lead-weighted butt of the
whip it had been aimed for his head
missed struck the thick part of his neck

  he was down on hands and knees the
hard-pounded dirt of the floor beneath
him ears ringing but still conscious
vorley close above he loomed in the
darkness breath wheezing through nos-
trils groping whip ready for another
blow

  yankee jim stood up machete ready
vorley must have glimpsed a glimmer
along its blade too close for the whip
butt he grabbed jims wrist rocked for-
ward ramming with the huge weight of
his body

  jim had felt his strength before but
only momentarily now he realized the
true quality of it massive and apelike

  he tried to twist his knife-arm free
vorleys fingers were like steel clamps
they staggered rammed the wall together
thatch and bamboo bent with the shape
of jims back trapping him preventing
him from moving to either side

  he could feel vorleys sweaty warmth
his breath short coming in grunting
wheezes vorley had dropped the whip
the fingers of his free hand had found
yankee jims throat they pressed down
crushing bone and cartilage

  vorley spoke so now end of trail
for you herr yankee-swine yah now
will we see-what happen to man-throw
schnapps in vorleys face

  there was no escape he was not a
match for the mans massive strength
the hand was closing more and more
tightly pinching off breath yellow lights
of unconsciousness were shooting across
yankee jims eyeballs

  there was one chance left their com-
bined weights might break the wall of
thatch and bamboo the two of them-
driving together

  his knee came up doubled found vor-
leys groin uncoiled he didnt expect it
to break the mans stranglehold it stag-
gered him back for an instant though

made him grunt he thought jim would
try and weave aside he rammed for-
ward with the strength of his stud-horse
legs and yankee jim drove his own
weight in unison

  they struck the wall it collapsed in a
heap of dust and thatch and torn bamboo

  the big mans hold had slipped he
flung himself belly down trying to pin
jim amid the debris to find the throat
again

  jim stood lifting the big man on his
shoulders one hand on crotch the other
on throat he intended to tilt him hurl
him head down the weight was too
much he reeled they fell in the huts
darkness

  jim came to a crouch vorley was
cursing light of morning came through
the shattered wall it showed vorley on
hands and knees patting hands across the
earth searching for the machete

  it was a crude native knife he must
have got it from the roshas he was
crouched edge of the blade up

  yankee jims own machete was gone
he didnt know where he could have
escaped but the girl was still there vor-
ley circled placing himself between jim
and the torn wall

  jim turned with him his heel came
in contact with heavy yielding object he
recognized it the whip

  he bent snatched it up

  vorley sprang at the same instant
knife swung underhand aimed for the
base of jims abdomen

  yankee jim had room to retreat he
went back one long stride the whip
swung its lash wrapped itself around
vorleys wrist

  jim bent his long body double the
lash tightened jerking vorley to one side
he struck the ground on one knee

  the whip loosened and freed itself
vorley was momentarily off balance he
tried to turn the whip roared air struck
his broad face tore it from temple to chin

  he squealed from pain reeled back
struck the wall rebounded the machete
was still in his hand his left arm was
uplifted in protection against the lash

  the whip again from a new direction
laying open the other side of his face
voodoo fangs

  vorley reeled in the small room he
was like a wounded rhino temporarily
blinded fanning with both hands making
wild swings with the knife

  hed have run for his life but his an-
tagonist had him cornered

  the whip hummed air and made a dull
chick as it struck the flesh of his shoul-
ders

  no no vorley had slipped belly
down and was pushing himself up pawing
with left forearm machete still in his
right hand no mercy herr gott
i will go yah you let me go to
jungle i never come back   

  the whip struck ripping his shirt from
one arm and shoulder

  no you hear me white man white
man in jungle must stick together you
would not lash a white man mine eyes
i am blind herr yankee

  he wasnt blind he could see to
dodge the lash he went half down try-
ing to escape legs doubled under him his
left arm darted out and the lash wrapped
itself vorley jerked the machet was
pointed forward he was trying to pull
yankee jim to his death on the blade

  but jim was balanced and vorley was
not he swung back pulling the big man
face down across the floor

  he stepped back and swung the whip
its lash tore off the back of his shirt
it came again vorley reeled to his feet
skin running blood

  he made it outside escape was the
only instinct left jn his brute mind

  he ran with yankee jim following
dawn was coming making strips of red
above the khaya trees a trail wound
through jungle through foot-grabbing
muck through weed-filled mire and green
slime where clouds of mosquitoes rose

  he fell got up reeled on it was a
blind staggering gallop until the depth
of slime slowed him he churned on
blind and elephantine the mud came to
his thighs to his hips he beat his arms
still swinging the futile machete

  he realized that yankee jim was no
longer following he tried to retrace his
steps wallowed blindly with swordgrass
higher than his head he sank deeper

yankee jim had followed vorley a
quarter-mile into the swamp then
he turned back the man was done for

  he reached the village clearing as dawn
sunlight commenced hunting the openings
through khaya trees the girl saw him
ran to the hut doorway stopped and
waited with a half scared expression in her
eyes

  its all right he said ill not harm
you ill take you back to shalomar

 you know who i am-

  your selmas daughter selma-con-
way after all these years he found it
hard to pronounce the name conway
name of the man who married the woman
james mcgraw had loved

  the girl seemed small and pitiful in her
batik cloth robe and the tatters of a white
knee-length dress

  he touched her shoulder she seemed
to grow weak at the sign of sympathy all
the fight gone from her she was sob-
bing teeth clenching her lower lip but
no sound from her throat

  its all right he said

  he let her weep against his chest the
years vanished and for a moment it
seemed he was once more with selma
that night on the terrace back in l m
with the portuguese violins playing waltz
music

  after a while her sobs became less she
still clung to him

  vorley didnt harm you

  she shook her head

  why would your mother send a man
like that to rescue you

  she didnt i hated vorley he was
once a foreman on the concession but
mother drove him away for beating the
natives he hung a native boy by the
thumbs and beat him to death with that
whip it was vorley who hired them to

carry me away-

  hired who to carry you away
emboa a ncimbo renegade who
worked at the concession but emboa
took me far away where even vorley could

stories

not find me he knew the cobalt com-
bine planned to send prospecting crews
beyond kamkamba and they would have
held me as hostage forever

  vorley had a note to james mcgraw

  he took it from jan heuter the man
that mother sent to find me he killed
heuter and his men from abush he
bragged of it last night she grabbed
his arm you wont leave me ever
ever yankee jim smiled not
till i take you home to selma and your
father

  my father is dead

canoes were waiting at the swamp
of ifobwa yankee jim kept think-
ing of selma of the message shed ad-
dressed to him the letter shed signed
always selma

  always the word struck him hard
she was a widow now and shed signed it
always

  the canoe stid through swamp water
leaving choppy waves of the paddles be-
hind it sitting in the bow yankee jim
could see his reflection in the greenish
water hollow cheeks covered by dark
whiskers eyes prominent the jungle had
changed him it had made a different
man of him shed never care for him
now

  there was a resthouse on kova plain
where the commisaire stopped during his
twice-yearly trips of inspection a house-
boy shaved jim cut his hair he put on
a suit of whites that had been left hang-
ing in the commisaires room they fit
well enough he looked at himself in a
rusty bit of mirror he was like a stranger

  he grinned and rolled an inyorka cig-
arette a stranger but one hell of an
improvement the intervening years
seemed like nothing he wondered if it
could be possible for a man to cover them
all at a single stride and leave all the rot-
tenness and regrets behind

  shalomar was a white house of cobble
and hardwood sitting aloof and serene on
a grassy knoll overlooking miles of plan-
tation land the girl sprang to the canoe
dock and ran uphill crossed the lower

wait ten minutes jim saw a houseboy
in a starched white stengah-shifter walk-
ing downhill carrying a parasol

 bwana yankee jim

  yes

  mama bondele-mama mama mkum-
bwa she say you come

  jim walked beneath the parasol en-
tered the deep shadow of a hall on to a
drawing room with wide french windows
and jalousies drawn against the sun she
was standing in the middle of the room
waiting

  hed dreamed of this meeting she
would be standing near the door waiting
for him selma slim and lovely wearing
a starched linen dress

  he met her eyes they were narrower
than he remembered and tiny wrinkles had
accumulated in their corners her skin
looked hard from cosmetics her hair
once glossy had turned dull and brittle
by years of tropics all of the softness
of youth was gone from her face

  she was looking at him waiting her
lips were parted a little showing the tips
of her blue-white teeth

  the house suddenly felt hot and breath-
less

  she was speaking thanking him for
returning her daughter saying some-
thing about a reward he shook his
head money was no good to him he
had everything more than all her money
could buy a hammock on his own
verandah a cache of square-bottle
schnapps a woman to bring it to him

stories

  hed taken off his sun helmet the
commisaires sun helmet newly pipe-
clayed he turned it in his hand

  she was expecting an answer he said
in a voice unexpectedly loud and harsh

  i want no reward ive had all the
reward i need

  he backed toward the door

  she lifted her hand there was some-
thing imperious in the gesture it was
the gesture of a woman who had learned
to command men

  youre-yankee jim

  yes

 you-never knew a man named-
james mcgraw 

 james mcgraw the name that had
been his hed gone so long as just plain
yankee jim that the sound of his real
name was strange to him

  dead dead in the jungle these eigh-
teen years

  he hurried outside he was in the sun
with his helmet off he put it on walked
faster than a white man should ever walk
the canoe was waiting he sprang over
the gunwale called his paddle boys

  shalomar disappeared around high
walls of hardwood trees along the river
he leaned back lulled by the steady stroke
of paddles

  they were taking him back schnapps
and his woman to carry it to him a good
woman despite her brown skin and her
body grown so fat that a sarong fit her
like bolt-cloth wrapped around a bale of
sisal
