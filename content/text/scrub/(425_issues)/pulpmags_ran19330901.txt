love stories of the real west number aybe you think im not glad i changed to listerine tooth paste its worked wonders for my teeth they used to be cloudy and dull now you can see how white and sparkling they are my gums are
firmer too and my whole mouth
feel swell ive never found any-
thing at any price that i liked so
well or gave such good results

  and speaking of price listerine
tooth paste has saved me about 
and ive used it only a year you see
it costs a quarter and the difference
between that and forty or fifty cents
may look small but it mounts up

   that old saying about saving for
a rainy day has a new meaning for
me it had already been raining for
a couple of years before i woke up
but believe me ive learned to watch
the small items now im darned
glad to save  on my tooth paste-
especially when i prefer listerine
tooth paste anyway

  

smile into your mirror examine

your teeth if they are yellowish or
lack lustre change to listerine tooth
paste for a few days then look at
the reflection of your teeth in the
glass again the difference you will
see there will be almost unbelievable

  tobacco stains and all other dis-
coloration will be gone your teeth
will be whiter than you ever thought
possible they will look alive-
sparkling with highlights glistening
with cleanliness

cannot scratch enamel

the new cleansing and polishing agent
in listerine tooth paste cannot
scratch or mar the softest tooth sur-
face yet its just hard enough to
remove the tartar that clings to the
teeth

  try this modern dentifrice today
you will like the taste and your
teeth and gums will be greatly bene-
fited at the same time you will be
saving about  on tooth paste alone

heritage of conflict

by l p holmes

a glorious bit of rangeland was loma carlyles heritage but with it came a gang of
traitorous thieving riders and then because loma was too lovely a thing to be left in
such hands fate sent a stalwart young rancher to protect and cherish her

        chapter i
        new country

n the rim of the great tableland
which rose with mesa-like
abruptness from the red hostile
gulf of the durango desert and
then swept away to the north in mighty
undulations until it buried itself in the
green timbered slopes of the cobalt
mountains the little cavalcade of three
horses came to a panting halt

  the trail up from the desert had been
steep and winding and treacherous
with it safely behind them the animals
seemed to relax with the thankfulness

of a precarious climb well completed

  the lone rider who bestrode the lead
horse and led the two pack animals on
a single running rope seemed to relax
also and turned glad eyes on those dis-
tant cool slopes which lay quiescent
and brooding and enchanting under the
bright pour of the sun

  loma carlyle had been envisioning
the cobalt mountains for the past
month and her first real view of them
was not disappointing now face to
face with their majesty she forgot the
scorching weary miles of desert travel
and the hair-raising climb to the rim of
the tableland


ranch romances

  her tan solarmon stetson was swept
off disclosing a head of sleek blue-black
hair cunningly massed at the nape of
her neck excitement built a fan of
color in her cheeks and her eyes aston-
ishingly blue shone under a like stim-
ulus

  there they are buck she cried
well camp on them tonight and to-
morrow well be home think of it
buck-no more sand and heat and al-
kali no more sour water and bitter
grass i cant wait to get there

  her mount a square-built sturdy little
buckskin gelding rolled a lazy eye wob-
bled his ears a few times and proceeded
to doze he was quite willing to take
his time and rest a bit but the girls
eagerness was not to be denied she
donned her hat lifted the reins and buck
stepped out obediently the pack animals
shuffling along behind

  despite the direct impact of the sun
the air was vastly different from that of
the desert the added elevation of the
tableland helped and there was a soft
vagrant wind sweeping down from the
cobalts crisp and invigorating and
bearing a faint fragrance of balsam
even buck noted the difference and un-
consciously quickened his pace

  a half hour slid by the sun was
slanting downward heading for a couch
in the misty blue of the distant moun-
tains where they curved a hundred
miles distant to the west the first tim-
ber was not far away now less than a
mile and loma could pick out individ-
ual trees giants which loomed above
their fellows

  the last of the undulations of open
land lay ahead higher and steeper than
any of the rest and up this final slope
the horses panted to the accompani-
ment of creaking leather at the crest
loma rose high in her stirrups to look
over abruptly she settled back and
reined buck to a quick halt

  she seemed to hesitate just a mo-
ment before slipping from the saddle
and dropping the reins to the ground
then crouching she moved upward
taking off her hat again at the very

crest she lay flat on her stomach peer-
ing through a handy clump of wild oat

  in the shallow swale beyond little
more than a hundred yards distant from
her own position were three riders
two of them had their backs to her
while the third was facing towards her
something about their postures sent a
queer gripping fear into lomas throat
they were crouched in their saddles
leaning forward their mutual gaze
never wavering the horses of the two
with their backs to the girl were mov-
ing sidling slowly apart

  and then with startling speed the
one who sat his horse alone spurred his
mount to a rearing twist and raced off
towards the timber hunched low in his
saddle quick as the move was one of
the other two was quicker his hand
lifted and steadied there was a spurt
of flame a flat thudding report and the
fleeing rider went headlong from his
saddle to lie a twisted blot upon the
earth

  for a long moment loma did not
breathe horror steeped in her veins
at the cold-blooded maneuver she had
just witnessed but this did net keep
her immune to a sudden wave of white-
hot anger she saw the other two rid-
ers lift their horses to a run heading
for the timber where the dusk was be-
ginning to gather in thick purple
shadows then she whirled raced back
to buck jerked out her rifle and panted
to the crest again

  the fleeing horsemen were close to
cover now just a few jumps away
swiftly the irate girl levered a cartridge
into the chamber dropped on one knee
and took the best aim she could the
gun leaped in recoil and spanged its
challenge across the world she saw one
of the distant horses rear and lunge
but it kept on going before she could
shoot again both riders were out of
sight in the timber

  careless and unthinking of her own
safety loma rose to her feet and ran
down into the swale towards the fallen
man rifle still clenched in her hands
she did not think of the chance that
heritage of conflict



the other riders now safe in cover
might turn and shoot

  evidently the fleeing men did not halt
for loma reached the side of the victim
unchallenged in any way she dropped
on her knees beside him recoiling from
the rapidly spreading crimson stain on
his shirt he was lying on his face
spread-eagled loma dropped her rifle
and turned him over she saw a young-
old face bronzed and hard-bitten gray
beneath the deep tan shuddering she
felt for a pulse there was none for the
rider was dead

  loma sagged back her face white and
stricken somehow she had not expected
this he had been so full of surging
life a moment before she grew dizzy
and sick the world darkening before her
eyes she might have fainted had not
a harsh grim voice pounded suddenly
upon her ears

  reach high quick-yuh dry-gulch-
in rat claw the clouds

  subconsciously loma did as directed
turning with trembling slowness to face
this new threat she saw a rider there
some ten yards distant a grizzle-haired
eagle-featured rider whose cold bleak
gaze seemed to cut right through her
and whose right hand gripped a huge
black gun that pointed with unwavering
steadiness squarely at her heart

  for some reason she spoke almost
stupidly he-hes dead she quav-
ered they-they killed him

  the grizzled old rider stiffened his
narrow eyes widening as he stared at
her good gawd he ejaculated a
woman i

  momentarily the gun he held moved
off line then jerked back to its original
unwavering position steady he
rasped dont try any tricks like that
on me git on yore feet and back away
from that rifle quick

  somehow loma mastered her trem-
bling limbs enough to do as bidden
there she stood biting her lips and clos-
ing her eyes tight in a futile attempt to
dam up the sudden tears she heard
the pound of another horse approach-
ing she heard an excited exclamation

in a new voice a keener and younger
voice than the other

  dad what is it why thats long
andy is he daid

  so this young hell-cat says who shot
him rumbled the older man she was
jest-

  lomas eyes jerked open blazing
through the curtain of tears in indig-
nant refutation i did not shoot
him she cried hotly thats not
true

  holy smokes so gasped the new
arrival staring at loma he was tall
and lithe and broad of shoulder with
the same eagle-like features possessed
by the older man loma met his look
defiantly

  the young fellow jerked his gaze
from her looking at the older
man

  yuh say she shot andy he de-
manded

  nothin else but son there was
two shots not so awful far apart i was
down yonder past the curve of the
swale i come up slow not knowin
jest what to expect i seen her runnin
down towards pore andy her rifle ready
for another shot if he showed signs of
life she didnt hear me cornin up be-
hind her an i got the drop easy but
i didnt think it was a woman i was
coverin-not till she turned i didnt
think any woman would pull a trick like
this

  lomas tears were gone the blue of
her eyes intensified until they were al-
most purple hot denial suffused her
she stamped her foot i tell you i
didnt shoot him there were two
others they-

  dont lie to me growled the older
man jest where are those other two
his tone was contemptuous

  wait a minute dad broke in the
young fellow lets listen to what she
has to say maybe weve got some
apologizin to do already

  lomas posture grew less tense i
saw it all from up there she nodded
towards the crest there were three
of them that poor fellow there was


ranch romances

facing the other two they had their
backs to me they were spreading
apart as though to get him be-
tween them suddenly he spurred his
horse to a whirling start and made a
run for the timber they shot him
then-brutally cold-bloodedly-in the
back

  i saw red i guess anyway i ran
back to my horse and got my rifle when
i got where i could see again the two
killers were racing for the timber-al-
most in it i shot at them once and
believe i creased one of their horses
it acted like it then i ran down to
see if i could help the rider they shot
i had just found that he was dead
when you came thats all-and its
true

  the older man laughed sarcastically
a pretty yarn but too damn thin son
yuh-

  the younger man lifted his hand
keep yore shirt on dad i can soon
find out if shes telling the truth wait
a minute

  he spurred his mount forward and
began searching the ground in the
rapidly fading light he soon struck
the tracks where the killers had raced
for the timber he went to the crest
of the swale and looked over then he
came back to the dead man and dis-
mounted making a careful examination
when he straightened up his hat came
off

  im apologizin for dad an me
miss he said quietly dad put that
gun away shes told the truth andys
gun aint on him first time i ever
saw him without it an he wouldnt
have made a run from no two men on
this earth even if they had the drop on
him-not if his gun was in the leather
i dont understand all this but im
shore the ladys on the square her out-
fit is up yonder over the crest saddle
hoss an two pack animals

  the old fellow gave in grudgingly
that dont sound exactly regular
either he growled why would any
lone woman especially a young hand-
some one like this gal be rammin

around the country alone with a pack
outfit mebbe she didnt do this killin
but im bettin shes tryin to cover up
somebody elses tracks she musta had
a man with her

  bosh snorted the young fellow
dont yuh think i know how to read
sign bettern that i tell yuh shes given
us the truth use yore haid

  he turned to loma im link san-
derson-an this is my father called
eagle by them who know him shore
im sayin again that were sorry we
misjudged matters

  his lean hawkish features lit up with
a disarming grin that loma responded
to immediately im glad to know
you she answered quietly my names
loma carlyle and i am heading for
thunder city can you tell me how far
it is

  too far for yuh to reach tonight
he said promptly a good twelve miles
at least unless yuh know the trails
yuhd be foolish to try for it in the
dark

  i guessed as much she nodded i
intended to camp for the night as soon
as i could find water

  link sanderson frowned its none
of my business of course but this
country aint exactly safe for a lone girl
to camp out in yuhd better come on
home with dad an me yuhd be right
welcome theres a easy trail from our
outfit to thunder city an yuh could
make the ride in tomorrow

  for a fractional second loma was on
the point of accepting this invitation
then her eyes went to the grim old cat-
tleman who she felt was still viewing
her with suspicion and her manner
stiffened thanks but ill be all right
ive been camping alone every night for
nearly a month im used to it-and
i have my rifle im not afraid in the
slightest

  young sanderson did not press his
invitation he shrugged if yuh cut
straight into the timber from here
yuhll pick up a meadow mebbe three
hundred yards up the slope theres a
spring at the upper end
heritage of conflict



  thanks again if youve no further
objections ill go after my horses and
head for it i want to get located be-
fore dark

  link shrugged again okeh in the
mornin if yuh look over to the east
from the meadow spring yuhll see a
pretty sizable ridge where the timber
thins out on top it runs due north
into the main range on top of that
ridge is a trail follow it until yuh
strike the mouth of bear creek canyon
turn due east there an cut across the
flank of the range about two miles an
yuhll run into the regular quarter
circle s trail leadin to town turn
left an yuh caint miss thunder
city

  thank you good-by

  loma picked up her rifle and climbed
out of the swale to her horses standing
patiently just where she left them she
was much her old self again as far as
being in control of her truant nerves
but her exultation had died this vivid
enchanting world had been smirched
with the touch of violent death and the
grim specter seemed to cling and mock
her her face was sober as she placed
the rifle in its boot and swung into
the saddle lifting buck into a
swing she moved down into the swale
again and headed directly for the
timber

  over on her right bulking dark in the
purple dusk the sandersons stood be-
side the dead man they had caught
long andys horse and were lifting the
dead rider into the saddle looking
back once more just before entering the
timber loma saw them riding away to
the east along the curving course of
the fatal swale the next moment she
was in the pungent blackness beneath
the timber

  she found the meadow without any
trouble and bucks own eager thirsty
nose located the spring for her she
dismounted and went expertly about
making camp packs and saddles were
removed and the three horses watered
the pack animals alone she picketed in
the midst of the luxurious grass below

the overflow of the spring buck she
let go free for she knew he would not
stray

  dry fuel was abundant and she soon
had a fire going she put on her bat-
tered little coffee pot and while waiting
for it to heat spread tarpaulin and
blankets by the time the coffee was
turning over she had bacon crisping in
the pan and a small pad of camp bread
browning before the flame

  she ate slowly and with relish at
the same time her thoughts were busy
with the fire crackling so briskly and
cheerfully before her the fatal shooting
episode seemed to take on an atmos-
phere of unreality all was so peaceful
now so still

  about the rim of the meadow the
towering conifers nodded in slow ca-
dence before the playful push of the
night wind the air was keen and
crisp and fragrant with the breath of the
trees the winking stars were brilliant
and warm and close human hate and
conflict and all baseness seemed very
far away now

  but loma did not allow the spell of
the night to delude her too far she was
hard-headed enough to know better as
she washed her utensils she frowned
she tried to recall what the two killers
looked like for the notion had come to
her that she would report the matter to
the authorities as soon as she reached
thunder city

  it was with some dismay that she
realized she could not surely identify
either of the men their backs had been
towards her all the time and such had
been the jumbled condition of her senses
she had noted no identifying character-
istics about their horses even had such
characteristics existed

  all in all it was considerable of a
puzzle to loma knowing so little of the
why and wherefore of everything cer-
tainly she had not enjoyed the part she
had had to play and somehow she felt
almost angry that her first impressions
of the new country that was to be her
home should have been shattered as
they were

the eagles chick

hen loma awoke the sun was
in her eyes she lay for a mo-
ment staring up into a golden sky
blissfully content of a sudden she real-
ized that a fire was crackling and that
the air was heavy and fragrant with the
aroma of coffee and sizzling bacon
startled she sat upright and her eyes
opened wide with amazement

  crouched over the fire wielding an
expert fork on the bacon was none
other than link sanderson his back
was towards her but she recognized
him instantly before she could catch
her breath he spoke

 good morning miss carlyle
sounded a pleasant drawl im beggin
yore pardon for taldn these liberties
with yore grub but if yore half as
hungry as i am yuhll forgive me how
dyuh like yore aigs-eyes open or
shut

  eggs exclaimed the startled girl
trying to master her confusion and sur-
prise i had no eggs in my outfit

  she saw his wide shoulders shake as
he chuckled i know it i brought
em in from the ranch thought yuh
might like some an ive made a mess
of dough-gods that look pretty dang
good even if i do say so myself

  lomas surprise gave way to a feel-
ing of indignance how long had this
drawling young fellow been around her
camp anyway and what right had
he to intrude in this fashion her tone
was cold and full of censuring sarcasm
i dont know about the eggs and
dough-gods but certainly there is
nothing wrong with your nerve is it
the custom in this country to make so
free and easy with other peoples prop-
erty

  well grinned link we folks try
an be hospitable now dont waste this
grand mornin rawhidin me my inten-
tions are the best in the world i
thought yuhd be kinda tickled to find
breakfast all hot an waitin when yuh
woke up what say we eat first an

then yuh can ride me bug-huntin after-
wards how did yuh say yuh liked
them aigs

  i didnt snapped loma but as
long as you insist-leave the eyes open

  she slid out of the blankets and
yawned pulled on her boots and with
soap and towel unearthed from her sad-
dle bags crossed to the spring the
water was so cold it seemed electric
and the rebound of it filled her with
such a sense of glowing well-being that
she found her anger and indignation
dissipating fast as she toweled her
face briskly she cautiously observed this
rather forward young rider

  grudgingly she had to admit that he
was good to look at his face was
particularly fine the hawkishness of
his profile gave him a look of intense
brilliant virility the jaw showing
strength and indomitable will it was
the face of a fighter fearless intelligent
and strong he was tanned to a mahog-
any brown he were a blue woolen
shirt and blue jeans over which were
strapped flaring batwing chaps worn
and use-scarred his boots vere ex-
pensive quilted ones and his spur
rowels were taped loma scored a count
in his favor for that evidently this man
loved horses too much to punish them
with naked rowels

  in stature he was tall with wide flat
shoulders and the narrow hips of a
rider about those hips sagged a car-
tridge belt carrying a walnut-butted
gun his neckerchief was a neutral
shade his stetson black and pushed
back far enough on his head to show
an expanse of crisp brown hair she
saw that his eyes were gray flawless
clear and keen

  apparently he was not watching her
in the slightest but he spoke suddenly
with a humorous quirk on his lips and
his words set the color to beating hotly
in lomas cheeks

  shore hope i qualify under examina-
tion he drawled but i warn yuh
that looks can lie im ornery an pig-
haided an lazy as all get-out

  indeed retorted loma im quite
heritage of conflict



sure im not interested in the slightest
my mistake he chuckled well
lets eat grubs ready

  there was nothing wrong with the
appetite of either of them and they ate
with a relish neither spoke until the
meal was finished then sanderson
rolled a cigarette and inhaled gratefully

  ill explain myself he stated after
reachin home last night dad an me
decided that we hadnt ought to have
let yuh run the risk of campin here
alone us knowin this country better
than yuh so i grabbed a blanket an
them aigs an came back

  i came jest close enough to make
out the gleam of yore fire then i
bedded down knowin that if yuh got
into trouble id hear things goin on
this mornin i sneaked in an started
breakfast mebbe i hurt yore feelins
-but shore i didnt mean to

  loma was more mollified than she
showed for truth and sincerity were in
his tone and words but she persisted
in her poise of chilliness i dont see
why you believed me unable to take
care of myself she declared i dont
believe there was a thing to fear

  an i dont believe yuh believe what
yuh jest said he returned coolly yuh
saw a man shot down in cold blood last
evenin those two yella curs who
killed him are only part of the bad hom-
bres who ride this country no tellin
what might have happened if one of
that stripe had been driftin an seen
yore fire

  i aint sayin but what yuh got plenty
of spunk an can take care of yoreself
most of the time but theres limits to
all things i jest felt a heap more easy
knowin i was close enough to help out
in case yuh did have trouble

  loma smiled she knew he was right
im sorry i was so grouchy she said
it was really very nice and thoughtful
of you thanks a lot and that break-
fast was awfully good

  his answering grin was instantane-
ous thats better-a heap better i
knew yuh had plenty of common sense
now im goin to ask a favor of yuh

it aint much to yuh but its a lot to
dad an me how about it

  it all depends cowboy make things
a little clearer what is this favor
why jest that yuh wont say nothin
about that killin last evenin when yuh
reach thunder city it wouldnt do no
good anyhow an dad an me can fight
our own battles wed appreciate it a
lot

  i see said loma thoughtfully you
feel that you can administer your own
law is that it

  i reckon we alius have
supposing you found out who it
was that did the shooting what would
you do about it

  she was amazed startled-almost
frightened at the look that swept over
him in an instant the smiling person-
able young rider was gone and in his
place there was a man mature in action
and thought his hawkish features set
in lines of savage harshness almost
cruelty and his gray eyes became icy
sparks

  yuhd be surprised he snapped
long andy was a good hand honest
an white an square-shootin somebody
is goin to pay for his killin which
reminds me of somethin else i want to
ask yuh would yuh recognize either
of them killers was yuh to see em
again

  loma shook her head i dont be-
lieve so she answered soberly i
thought of that last night before going
to sleep you see their backs were to
me all the time and there was nothing
about their broncos i could recall ex-
cept that they looked dark in coloiing
i savvy muttered sanderson
thoughtfully their broncs mighta
been bays or chestnuts or blue roans-
or ten dozen shades in between which
means they were exactly the same as
a thousand other broncs wasnt there
any words spoken or names called
no that was what made it so
ghastly if words were spoken they
must have been very low i couldnt
hear a thing im sorry i cant help you
more there is nothing id rather see


ranch romances

than those two brutes brought to jus-
tice

  they will be declared link yuh
said last night yuh thought yuh creased
one of their broncs

  yes im really sure i did when
i shot the animal lunged and reared as
though the bullet had burned it some-
where

  link got to his feet well thats
somethin anyway ill kinda go on a
still hunt for a crippled hoss now i
reckon yore anxious to hit the trail ill
wash up these dishes an help yuh pack
link got another surprise when it
came to packing he had known a good
many men who understood the intri-
cacies of a properly thrown diamond
hitch but loma carlyle was the first
woman he had ever seen throw an ex-
pert one he knew that he couldnt
have done better himself

  this charming girl with her striking
coloring of black hair and vivid blue
eyes grew more amazing and rose high-
er and higher in his estimation with
every passing moment she was com-
petent handsome and possessed of ex-
traordinary courage for one of her sex

  this outfit shows a lot of hard use
he ventured yuhve come quite a
ways

  from lees ferry

  link whistled as he stared at her
clear across the wild hoss badlands
an the durango desert

  she nodded im used to hardship
ive had a lot of it

  link swept off his hat then mebbe
yuh wont mind me sayin that yore
the gamest an most capable young lady
i ever had the privilege of meetin
loma colored but said nothing as she
swung into her saddle and gathered up
the lead rope

  link stepped back his hat still in his
hands adios miss carlyle foller
the directions i gave yuh last night an
yuh cant miss thunder city my hoss
is back where i bedded down i aim to
pick up the trail of them two killers
an foller it as far as i can but i aint
hopin for much mebbe yuh hit that

hoss more center than yuh thought an
it coulda played out somewhere along
the line ill take a look-see anyhow
adios

thunder city hardly fitted its
sonorous name it lay in a long
verdant meadow walled on all sides by
the towering green of coniferous timber
east and west this timber ran up and
up in ridge and slope until it thinned
out at snow-line above which reared
half a mile more of mountain bare and
precipitous for the most part but
crowned at last with eternal snow
these peaks called east cobalt and
west cobalt were the absolute crests
of the range

  to the north a stage road ran out of
thunder city it wound along in lazy
curves through the timber climbing
slowly up to thunder pass whence it
dropped down through zigzag and cut-
back to the rolling rangeland beyond
leading finally to the town of healy on
the railroad forty-odd miles it was
from thunder city to healy

  perhaps a dozen people were visible
when loma carlyle rode in and every
one of them stopped to stare at this
vivid girl riding alone with her pack
horses most of the spectators were
men dressed in chaps sombreros and
spurred boots but there was one stout
matronly-looking woman of early mid-
dle age seated in a home-made rocker
on the porch of a tiny cabin and to her
loma turned for information

  i wonder if you could tell me where
i could find judge reynolds she
asked smiling pleasantly

  the answering smile was genuine and
motherly of course i imagine youll
find him in his office that is the third
building up on your right if he isnt
there stop at the blacksmith shop the
judge and my man jim do an awful lot
of arguing over politics

  thank you

  loma rode on dismounting before the
building designated it was a large
building given over in most part to a
general store but one small corner of
heritage of conflict



it held an office over the door of which
hung a sign

judge thomas reynolds attorney-at-law

  loma knocked at the door and en-
tered at a brisk bidding before a bat-
tered old desk sat a round white-haired
rosy little man with twinkling eyes and
cheery lips as he beheld loma he
jumped to his feet bowing low

  i am happy to see you madam he
chirruped i am judge reynolds what
can i do for you

  i am loma carlyle she said quietly
ah said the judge i am happy
to see you wont you sit down

  loma took the chair offered and laid
a packet of letters on the desk youll
desire proof of course she stated
youll find it in there

  the judge adjusted a pair of old-fash-
ioned spectacles and buried his nose in
the papers for ten minutes not a word
was spoken then he looked up and
nodded

  not a question he said im very
glad you have come miss carlyle i
feel now that i have discharged my debt
to your uncle bert mannering was a
very good friend of mine but i had
begun despairing of locating you

  im sorry i was teaching school in
a little out-of-the-way town in northern
arizona it was only by merest chance
that i ran across the personal advertise-
ment in an old paper

  the judge rubbed his pudgy hands
together better late than never he
beamed tritely i suppose you wish to
take over control of the inherited prop-
erty immediately

  id like to ive come quite a dis-
tance and id like to get settled as soon
as possible

  very well it will take a few days
to get the necessary paper work done
but there is no need of your waiting
around until then when all is in readi-
ness ill get word to you and you can
drop in any time then to close the mat-
ter up the ranch-your ranch now
miss carlyle-lies southeast of town
some fourteen miles it is a valuable

inheritance and one of great future
promise your uncles registered brand
is the bar c  i suppose youll keep
that

  yes nodded loma i see no rea-
son to change if it was good enough
for uncle bert it is good enough for
me

  thats common sense approved the
judge youll find the ranch in good
shape deuce coburn the foreman is
a capable man and has been very con-
scientious over his responsibility since
your uncles death

  they discussed matters for nearly an
hour then loma thanked the judge
and left

  outside the office she hesitated a mo-
ment then headed for the wide dusky
door of the store there were several
personal purchases she wished to make

  a rider was coming along the street
towards her his step was unsteady
obviously he had been drinking his
eyes bloodshot and set were fixed on
loma and the impact of them sent a
queer ripple of revulsion through her
she hurried her steps to gain the open
door but the rider anticipated the move
and got there ahead of her he blocked
her way teetering on his toes

  there was a depraved viciousness on
his leering features drink-sodden and
brutal loma tried to slip past him but
he shot out a grimy hand and caught
her by the shoulder

  not so fas sister he blurted not
so fas lemme git a good look at yuh
damn me fer a sheepherder if yuh aint
a lil beauty cmon smile fer me

  on the contrary lomas eyes turned
violet and smoky with anger she had
met drunken men before and had been
accosted by them but never had one
dared lay his hand on her this fellows
touch made her flesh creep she tried
to jerk away but the grip on her shoul-
der tightened the drunken leer became
a grimace of anger

  so-o-thas it eh the fellow
snarled think yore too good fer
texas jack to talk to huh show yuh
-bet ill show yuh fer that yuhll


ranch romances

have to kish me fore i let yuh go

  lomas answer was purely reaction
with her free hand she slapped him and
such was the power of her lithe young
strength the ruffian staggered back but
his grip was maintained he cursed and
dragged her towards him she fought
him off frantically kicking and strug-
gling

  dimly she sensed the approach of a
running horse pounding down the
street the animal came to a halt near-
by and a saddle creaked the next mo-
ment a human catapult flashed between
loma and the drunk the impact threw
her back against the wall of the store
jarred and bewildered

  she saw the drunk reel a step or two
then catch his balance spouting curses
the curses broke off before the sodden
spat of a hard-swung fist and the drunk
went headlong where he lay in a
sprawled motionless heap over him
stood the wide-shouldered figure of link
sanderson his face a cold relentless
mask his eyes narrow and gleaming

  i oughta gun yuh where yuh lay
yuh rotten coyote sanderson was
growling i will next time i meet yuh
-so help me i will from now on this
range is too small for yuh an me texas
jack

  suddenly link seemed to realize that
his words were wasted for the rider
was out cold he straightened up
turned and faced loma his hat came
off did he hurt yuh he demanded

 she shook her head no-no
but- she shuddered

  i understand said link hes a
filthy brute whos been around these
parts over-long ill see to that little
matter as soon as he snaps out of it

  the ominous purport of links words
steadied loma lets forget it she
jjaid quietly after all he wasnt really
responsible it was the liquor in
iiim

 not altogether snapped link
hes jest naturally a crooked no-good
polecat drunk or sober hes like the
rest of that bar c  tribe theres a
house-cleanin due an-

  do you mean he rides for the bar
c  broke in loma

  yeah but theyre due to lose a hand
today soon as he gets on his feet
again im givin him his walkin papers
ill give him jest an hour after that
if hes still around-well- he left the
sentence unfinished ominously so

  loma stiffened slightly what au-
thority have you over the bar c 
she demanded

  none-outside of this he tapped
the gun swinging at his thigh but
colonel colt is a powerful persuader at
times this is gonna be one of them
i alius used to think that bert manner-
ing was a pretty level-haided sort of a
feller but after lookin over that bunch
of coyotes he put in charge of his ranch
jest before he died ive had to revise
my opinion they aint fit for hell-rcom
not one of em mannering musta been
gettin childish in his old age

  lomas eyes were a smoky violet
again of course im thanking you
for what you did just now she stated
coldly but youll oblige me by keep-
ing your opinions of my dead uncle to
yourself as for him-she nodded
towards the drunken rider who was be-
ginning to stir again-ill have him dis-
charged immediately

  it was link sandersons turn to be
astounded he stared at her good
lord he ejaculated bert manner-
ing-yore uncle then you must be
that heir that judge reynolds has been
tryin so long to locate

  i am is there anything wrong in
that

 but-but- link stuttered aim-
lessly good lord you-why yuh
aint figgerin on takin charge are
yuh

 i am-immediately why not
why not why not shucks itd
take me the rest of the day to tell yuh
why yuh caint

  i beg your pardon said loma stiffly
i see no reason why i shouldnt judge
reynolds tells me my title is absolutely
clear the ranch is mine and i intend
to run it
heritage of conflict



  but yuh get me wrong miss car-
lyle link persisted seriously i aint
questionin yore ownership im sayin
yuh caint go out there alone some-
body has got to go with yuh-some
other woman yuh see-

  loma shook her head i dont see
why i shouldnt im quite able to take
care of myself thank you again im
obliged

  she nodded and pushed by him enter-
ing the store for a long moment link
stared after her then growling a low
curse he turned to face the rider he had
knocked out texas jack was sitting
up now and the vacuousness of his ex-
pression faded gradually

  he vas fingering the gun at his belt
but link stepped swiftly forward and
jerked it away from him he thumbed
open the loading gate of the weapon
and jacked out the cartridges then he
tossed the weapon back at its owners
feet

 yore time is up feller link
growled this country is sick of the
sight of yuh yuh got an hour to get
out-not a second more ill be in town
that long next time yuh an me meet
its a showdown with the smoke a-
rollin ive told yuh somethin

  turning on his heel link went to the
door of judge reynolds office and en-
tered without knocking texas jack
watched him go then crawled to his
feet sober now and with his depraved
features a mask of hate he reloaded
his gun slouched down the street and
mounted a bronco roweling the animal
cruelly as he went surging out of town

  judge reynolds looked up at link
sandersons abrupt entrance saw who
it was and smiled pleasantly howdy
link what brings you here

  i come in to tell yuh that yuh oughta
have yore haid felt said link shortly

  the judges merry eyes twinkled
thanks for the suggestion being hu-
man i make blunders and after some
particularly bad blunder ive often
thought i ought to myself whats
wrong

  plenty what in the name of com-

mon sense did yuh wanta send that car-
lyle girl out to the bar c  spread
alone for yuh oughta know better
than that

  the judge laughed link youre an
alarmist im quite sure shell get along
very well

  i differ snapped link shes haid-
in for trouble shore as yore a foot
high yuh oughtave warned her
off

  bosh youre like a small boy-see-
ing goblins behind every tree i know
you dont like deuce coburn but that
doesnt alter the fact that he is a good
man in his place-a mighty good man
hes run that ranch right up to snuff
since bert mannerings death ive been
keeping a very close check on things
and i cant find a single mistake his
tallies are full and complete and show-
ing a nice increase yes deuce is do-
ing a good job

  mebbe growled link i wasnt
referrin to the business side of things
though my kick is that no girl spe-
cially a young an pretty one like miss
carlyle should be allowed out at that
ranch alone good lord that bar c
 crew is the hardest collection of nuts
i ever saw on a ranch they aint got
no respect for gawd or man an deuce
coburn aint any better than the rest of
em

  on the contrary observed the judge
imperturbably i consider deuce a very
reliable foreman granted that some of
his riders are wild but deuce is quite
capable of keeping them in their place
no link youre whistling in the dark

  link shrugged and turned to the door
have it yore own way judge mark
my words though therell come a time
when yuh shore will go to an expert
to have yore haid felt

  link slammed the door savagely and
stood for a moment glowering down
the street he saw loma carlyle leave
the store with several small packages
in her arms these she stowed away
in her saddle bags mounted and rode
out of town when the fringe of tim-
ber had swallowed her up link prowled

along frowning and thoughtful
through the clear sparkling air re-
sounded the clang of a blacksmiths
busy hammer

  links frown was replaced by a smile
he hurried along to the little cabin
where the kindly-faced woman still sat
in her rocker he tipped his hat grin-
ning boyishly howdy missis downs
he greeted her perching himself on the
low step at her feet yore lookin
mighty pert an handsome today

  stout mrs downs smiled fondly you
young scalawag she retorted you
dont fool me a bit youve got some
scheme up your sleeve what is it out
with it

  link twirled his hat in his lean
strong bronzed hands well its this-
away missis downs bert mannerings
heir has finally showed up judge rey-
nolds has turned the bar c  over to
her she-

  she ejaculated the surprised lady
do you mean to say that vivid girl
with those wonderful eyes who was
looking for the judge is bert manner-
ings heir

  well said link dreamily she
shore has got wonderful eyes bluer
than i ever thought eyes could be an
they turn a sort of smoky violet when
she gets mad yesm i reckon thats
her

  well now isnt that fine im aw-
fully glad i liked that girl the mo-
ment i saw her

  yesm agreed link again so did
i but missis downs shes gonna be
out there all alone with that bunch of
wild hombres that ride for the bar c 
an i dont feel right easy in my mind
about it now if there was another wo-
man with her for a few days-a older
woman-why mebbe them knot-haided
bar c  peelers would realize that shes
got friends here in town that are inter-
ested in her an sorta keepin an eye
open to see that she aint bothered

  mrs downs pursed her lips thought-
fully theres something in what you
say link she admitted i suppose

you are hinting that im that elderly

woman

  well sort of

  but link how would i ever get out
there and back there isnt a chance
of driving out in a buckboard and its
been years since i was on a horse
link grinned impishly running his
fingers through his hair weil yuh

for some time that yuh oughta take up
ridin again they do say it is swell ex-
ercise for the figger an i know where
i can rake up a quiet easy-ridin little
bronc that yuh couldnt get off a walk
with a stick of dynamite

 aunt molly downs laugh echoed
merrily you scamp she cried im
almost tempted but jim downs would
be scandalized

link realizing that the victorjr was
won ill knot his tail if he gets ruc-
tious ill go get that bronc right away
an ill ride out most the way to the
bar c  with yuh be back in a jiffy
he loped away chuckling molly
downs looked after him her eyes soft
its the sorrow of my life that god
never sent me a son like you link san-
derson she murmured

chapter iii

blotted brands

the first glimpse loma carlyle had
of her future home was more than
favorable in fact it brought back to
her an exultation akin to that she had
experienced when first she glimpsed the
charm and grandeur of the cobalt
mountains the trail from town had
wound along the southern slope of the
mountains leading always east

  at first it had led for miles through
solid unbroken aisles of timber where
one rode in perpetual twilight but
finally a change took place the timber
thinned meadows enchanting in their
luxurious green and smeared with
slashes of wild flowers became more
and more numerous the steady slope
of the range gave way to broken coun-
heritage of conflict



try that gradually leveled out until
loma glimpsed ahead a tremendous
valley shaped like a v

  one arm of the valley ran directly
east the other stretched out to the
south reaching down towards a great
vague gulf of mist and harsh colors
which she judged was the durango des-
ert a central ridge lanced with tim-
ber separated the two valleys which
narrowed as they reached their apex
until only a cut gulch connected them

  at one point the view of the valleys
was extremely clear and here loma
reined in momentarily all up and down
the emerald expanse of the open ranges
she could make out herds of grazing
cattle the red backs and white faces of
which shone resplendent in the clear
crisp sunlight

  far down the southern arm was a
group of toy-like cubes which loma
identified as buildings but try as she
would she could not make out anything
of the sort in the eastern terrain until
she had ridden some two miles farther
on then of a sudden she saw the
headquarters of the bar c 

  the buildings of the bar c  were
numerous and all sizes beyond them
was a maze of stake and rider corrals
all corrals save one were empty and in
this some score of horses were racing
and twisting trying to escape the cun-
ning ropes in the hands of two punch-
ers outside that corral a portable
forge was being operated by a third
man while three others were working
about a bronco that was thrown and
hogtied

  the man at the forge was the first to
see loma and he called a warning to
the others who dropped their work im-
mediately it seemed that they were full
of suspicion and distrust for one of them
openly stepped apart to pick up a win-
chester rifle which he held in readiness
in the hollow of his arm

  somewhat perturbed at this reception
loma rode slowly forward one of the
group spoke sharply to the others then
strode out to meet her he was a big
man tall and thickly built with enor-

mous shoulders his skin was either
swarthy or very heavily tanned and his
face harshly featured

  loma was the first to speak and as
her soft melodious tones struck his ear
the rider stiffened in amazement

  how do you do she said i am
loma carlye this i judge is the
bar c  ranch

  the rider was so completely taken
back he seemed momentarily bereft of
speech he stared at her then he re-
covered and swept off his sombrero

  this is the bar c  right enough
miss so yore miss carlyle eh
shore im glad to see yuh im deuce
coburn if yuhve talked to judge
reynolds he probably mentioned my
name

  his voice had a peculiar quality
heavy slightly thick and with a touch
of arrogance in it but he was patently
trying to be agreeable and loma felt no
resentment

  yes she nodded the judge spoke
of you-and very favorably i see that
you and the other riders are busy so
dont let me interrupt your work j st
show me the main house and ill  k
around and get settled later well -k
matters over and become adjusted

  thats the main house-the one yon -
der highest up the crick said coburn
but first give the boys a chance to
meet yuh hi gang come over here an
say howdy to yore new boss miss loma
carlyle

  as the riders approached loma re-
membered that link sanderson had
called them a bunch of human coyotes
so she surveyed them curiously

  she was a trifle disturbed at their ap-
pearance coburn was by far the most
prepossessing of the lot to a man they
were set of face hard and wild-looking
with slouchy carriage and a baffling
evasiveness of eye all carried guns
two of them carrying two weapons
apiece the holsters of which were tied
down with buckskin thongs their ages
were problematical

ranch romances

wish is yore order remember that
dopey go up to the main house with
miss carlyle an unpack for her put
the stuff on the porch then take care
of her broncs rest of yuh get back on
the job

  he turned to loma yuhll proba-
bly find the place kinda upset its been
bachelors quarters for quite a time but
soon as yuh see what yuh want done
call dopey hell swamp out for yuh
loma nodded then essayed a little
speech she had been rehearsing all the
way out from town i want to run the
ranch along the same general lines as
uncle bert did men she told them
i want to be fair and just in all mat-
ters and if you will help me out im
sure well all get along nicely

  coburn smiled boldly at her thats
a up-an-down proposition miss car-
lyle ill speak for the boys were with
yuh to a finish

 the house as coburn warned
showed plenty of signs of male occu-
pancy it was dusty and disordered and
in need of a thorough house-cleaning
before dopey had even finished unpack-
ing for her she saw that she was going
to need help and plenty of it she told
dopey so

  yesm he nodded i reckoned
yuhd find things kinda tore up be
with yuh soon as i git these broncs
cared for

  he bowlegged his way off with the
horses and loma gazed after him tell-
ing herself that aside from texas jack
this fellow was quite the most unpre-
possessing individual she had ever
chanced to meet he had lank tow hair
hanging untidily about his ears and shirt
collar

  his face held an unnatural pallor in a
country where men were normally
deeply bronzed his profile was a re-
ceding one with buck teeth a weak chin
and peculiar bulging frog-like eyes
his clothes were badly worn and dis-
tressingly untidy

  loma thought again of what link
sanderson had said and she grew a lit-
tle panicky but abruptly her slim

shoulders stiffened and her head went
up after all range work was hard
work requiring the services of hard
men and a cowboy who had been help-
ing shoe refractory broncs in the dust
and dirt and heat could hardly be ex-
pected to appear immaculate

  any lingering doubts which might
have persisted were soon banished be-
fore a period of intense industry the
homey sturdy log dwelling was swept
and scrubbed from one end to the other
walls were wiped down windows
washed and the pile of odds and ends of
equipment thrown out on the porch
grew to amazing proportions the
kitchen was given especial care and
dopey worked as he hadnt worked in
years

  loma indignant over the discovery
of what seemed ten thousand dead ciga-
rette butts scattered everywhere drove
the perspiring puncher unmercifully
pan after pan of water was heated used
and thrown out dopey developed a
crick in his back and his knees were
sore from crawling over what seemed an
acre of floor with scrubbing brush and
bucket of soap suds

  men stated loma severely are
natural-born pigs youd think that the
whole wide world was one big ash-can
for them to throw their cigarette butts
into and old boots-and socks-ugh

 yesm agreed dopey meekly
yesm thats right

  eventually it was done just as aunt
molly downs came ambling sedately up
on a sleepy mild-looking pony loma
met her at the door with mingled sur-
prise and swift pleasure

  my dear explained aunt molly as
she climbed stiffly from the saddle
youve no idea what misery ive gone
through to come on this visit so dont
grow angry with me im just a poor
fat woman so full of aches and pains i
could scream goodness how good it
is to get my feet on solid earth once
more and that poor horse ill bet he
feels that the weight of all ages has been
removed from his back

  she laughed then with genuine mer-
heritage of conflict



riment and loma joined in a sudden
rush of affection for this amiable soul
gripped her and she welcomed aunt
molly with genuine delight she real-
ized now that a feeling of loneliness had
been growing on her-loneliness for one
of her own sex

  of course said molly i know who
you are loma carlyle so that scamp
link sanderson told me im mrs
downs aunt molly to all my friends
she eyed the pile of discarded equip-
ment on the porch i see your femi-
nine instincts to clean house have al-
ready asserted themselves i hoped to
get here in time to help men can be the
most careless brutes

  they went inside arm in arm dopey
seized the opportunity to get away and
slouched down to the corrals leading
aunt mollys pony the rest of the
crew had just finished their job of shoe-
ing as he came up he stared at them
sourly

  pigs he muttered thats what
yuh are a bunch of careless brutes and
natural-born pigs she said so-an i
figger shes right after all the muck i
had to clean up goddlemighty im
worked to a frazzle an to think that
some folks hire out for that kind of a
job

link sanderson having parted
with molly downs just above the
apex of the two valleys rode down the
south one at a leisurely lope he felt
a lot better knowing that for the next
few days at least the presence of mrs
downs at the bar c  would keep the
riders of that outfit subdued and by
that time he gambled they would real-
ize that it would be unwise and unsafe
to molest loma carlyle

  link frankly admitted lomas charms
she was unlike any girl he had ever met
before good-looking proud and pos-
sessed of a certain vibrant charm he
could not fathom he only knew that
the mere sight of her had set his pulses
to throbbing and that from his very first
look at her he had been unable to get
her out of his mind

  he considered himself without any
suggestion of ego to be pretty normal
and sanely balanced with a stricter code
of ethics than most men boasted and
if loma carlyles vivid beauty had so
intrigued him what would it do to the
wilder and more unprincipled riders she
would perforce come in contact with
link frowned at the thought

  a small group of grazing herefords
scattered to let him pass and with the
instinct of long habit his eyes ran over
them noting their condition and num-
ber his gaze fixed on one two-year-old
and he reined in abruptly burned on
that particular animals flank was a
bar c  brand which was in no way
unusual in itself here at the head of
the valleys cattle drifted back and forth
bar c  stock mixing with his fathers
stuff and vice versa

  but to links expert eye that brand
did not look exactly right it seemed a
little out of proportion and uneven not
at all like the usually crisp outline from
a stamp iron it might have been a mav-
erick of course discovered by one of
the bar c  riders and branded with
a running iron still   

 he stared harder at the animal
frowning his eyes narrowed in sud-
den decision he unstrapped his riata
from his saddle and ran out a noose
he kneed his bronco into a run and
swept down upon the startled two-year-
old

  too late it scuttled for safety the
rope hissed out writhing like a snake
the loop flew true picking up both
hind feet neatly the wise bronco
stopped and braced the rope twanged
tight and the startled animal feet cut
from beneath it struck the ground with
a thud

  while the pony kept the rope singing
tight link knelt beside the panting
whiteface and examined the brand very
closely his finger tips sensitive and
probing traced the mark when he
finally stood up his face was harsh and
stern his eyes cold as he rolled a
cigarette his lips moved

  so-o thats it eh he muttered


ranch romances

this particular brand will interest
dad

  he went back to his horse mounted
and slacked up on the rope the year-
ling struggled to its feet kicked off the
loop and started to run instantly link
was after it coiling his rope as he rode
he turned the animal and headed it
down the valley towards home his
pony seeming to understand what was
wanted stayed close on the two-year-
olds heels hazing it deftly along
thwarting every attempt the whiteface
made to dodge off to the side

  perhaps a mile had been covered in
this fashion when out of the timber to
the east a rider came loping he was
heading at such an angle as to cut off
links progress link recognized the
man instantly but his only sign of it
was to loosen his gun in the holster

  some twenty yards distant the new-
comer reined in he was a thin
spidery-looking individual with hard
jet eyes in a swarthy face those eyes
went over the two-year-old in a set
stare then fixed in unwinking intensity
on link

  where yuh haidin with that two-
year-old sanderson he demanded his
voice thin and reedy

  i reckon yuh know glick links
answer was a cold drawl

  i suggest yuh turn it loose again
yuh might be accused of rustlin an in
this country a rustler is open game for
the fust man who can get lead into
him

  links laugh was harsh he was
staring straight into those beady orbs
now his body smoothly tensed those
are the truest words yuh ever spoke
glick he retorted i know what yore
drivin at spin em when yore ready

  spider glicks reaction to these words
were movements as smooth and fast as
light both hands flicked down and up
and a twin report crashed across the
silences

  it was a move that would have caught
a more unwary man cold with a sen-
tence of certain death for spider glick
seldom missed at twenty yards this

time however he did for the simple rea-
son that link sandersons body was not
where it had been a split-second before

  at the slight settling move in the
saddle glick had made before he went
for his guns link had slithered far over
in his saddle he hung practically out
of sight on the off side of his horse
holding his weight by knee hooked
about the cantle and left hand locked
to the horn glicks two slugs cut past
where links waist had been one of
them low enough to slash the chap leg
above his knee

  glicks guns made sheening arcs as
he flipped them back caught the ham-
mers with his hooked thumbs then
threw down again as they came level
link shot once from under his horses
neck the slug cut glicks mount just
deep enough across the withers to cause
the brute to drop to its knees partially
stunned

  glick caught unawares as his mount
dropped so suddenly was thrown for-
ward on its neck he fought wildly to
regain his balance snarling like a cor-
nered wolf he was too slow how-
ever for link pulled himself back into
his saddle and drove an accurate slug
into the viperish gunmans chest glick
gasped and rolled to the ground beside
his horse

  link waited a moment to make sure
then dismounted and walked over
glick was dead and link caught the
rein of the horse just as it lurched to
its feet again

  the hard relentless hawkish look
was on links face again as he stared
down at the dead man lucky for me
-unlucky for you glick he mur-
mured but yuh didnt have me fooled
yuh were out for my scalp whether id
been bluffed out or not if yuhd had
yore winchester with yuh yuhd
plugged me from the timber i got no
false idees about yuh glick-an no re-
grets

  he reloaded his colt scanned the sur-
rounding country to make sure no
friend of glicks was in the vicinity
then lifted the dead man into his own
heritage of conflict



saddle tying him there with a thong
the reins he looped over the saddle
horn then he turned the animal until it
was headed towards the convergence of
the two valleys and hit it a cut with
his quirt it went off at a run with its
gruesome burden

  swinging astride link picked up the
two-year-old once more and resumed
his way hazing it before him a half
hour later he had the whiteface in one
of the quarter circle s corrals

  an amiable-faced puncher appeared
in the bunkhouse doorway go get
dad sleepy called link i got some-
thin here to show him

  by the time old eagle sanderson ap-
peared link had roped and hogtied the
luckless whiteface

  whats up son rumbled eagle as
he climbed into the corral

  plenty was the succinct reply
take a look at that brand see if it
tells yuh the same story it tells me
the old cattleman examined the
brand with minute care when he stood
up and faced link his face was cold and
savage whered yuh find that crit-
ter he snapped

  up at the haid of the valley the
brand seemed kinda funny to me so i
roped the brute and looked it over
then i brought it home on the way
i run into spider glick

  eagle stiffened sharply and cursed
the devil what happened

  we shot it out said link quietly
what yuh shot it out with spider
glick seein yuh there all in one piece
thats hard to believe son

  link showed the leg of his chaps
where giicks lead had ripped it

 but what did he do then de-
manded eagle quit shootin

  jest about said link i out-foxed
him an got him center

  the old man stared at his son with
wide eyes yuh mean yuh killed spi-
der glick shore yuh didnt shoot him
in the back did yuh

  link flushed but his gaze was steady
im a sanderson dad he answered
we dont shoot men in the back

  a grim smile twitched at the old
mans lips and high pride gleamed in
his eyes im apologizin lad but
shore knowin glick-an knowin yuh
-well-

  i savvy nodded link giicks
never been shaded before but theres
alius a first time dad i happened to
be the man to do it

  eagle sanderson stared out across the
sunlit world his face sobering again
son he said takin the life of a fel-
low man is serious business i dont
want any son of mine to develop into a
killer but sometimes it is a case of
kill or be killed an i know this was
one of them lifes thataway in this
country

  yuh may have to rock off more men
before yuh die i expect yuh will seein
the turn things are takin right now
but i hope itll always be a case of self-
defense with yuh

  it always will be dad said link
quietly eagle shook his boys hand
i sired a man son im proud of yuh
now i reckon we better pay deuce co-
burn a visit i wanta see how hell ex-
plain that blotted brand well take
the whiteface along with us but theres
the grub call we better eat first

molly downs-amazon

after the house-cleaning was
complete loma carlyles first
move was to heat up a huge tub of
water and take a thoroughly satisfying
scrub on dressing again instead of
the jeans and shirt she donned a simple
gingham dress that she brought to light
from one of the packs these garments
changed her appearance amazingly and
heightened her femininity and charm
molly downs exclaimed with delight
over her	

  child youre delicious stunning
why youll have these simple cowboys
completely out of their minds im
warning you just watch them moon
around

  loma colored and laughed theyll


ranch romances

find me pretty practical i imagine i
havent any time for such foolishness
mrs downs shrugged ive heard
that story before my dear when the
right man comes along-well wait and
see

  youre exaggerating terribly pro-
tested loma i havent seen any of
them yet who appeared greatly taken
consider dopey that wretch who
scrubbed out the house for me im
quite sure hell hate me for the rest of
my life i bossed him dreadfully

 i know one of them who is badly
struck right now teased mrs downs
when some young man confides to me
that a certain girls eyes are bluer than
he ever thought eyes could be and
added that those same eyes turned a
smoky violet when their owner became
angry-why id say that young man
was quite impressed

 lomas color deepened and she
changed the subject im starving
lets get something to eat

  by the time the meal was finished
the two of them were very good friends
indeed the straightforwardness of
the elder woman wholesome and
cheery loma found very stimulating
and full of comfort

 they had finished their meal and
were sitting quietly talking when a
raucous yell of rage and anger sounded
down by the corrals it cut through
the peaceful moment like the blood-
hungry scream of some predatory
animal and the sound of it sent a chill
up lomas spine while her cheeks
paled

  what is that she gasped

 molly downs had heard that sound
before in her life and always it pre-
saged violence and battle and sudden
death it was the voice of a man
gripped in insensate killing rage she
did not answer loma but scuttled to
the porch loma was right at her heels
down by the corrals they saw the bar
c  riders grouped about a horse
across the saddle hung a limp ghastly
figure molly downs knew and turned
to shoo the girl back into the house

  but lomas shoulders were straight
and though the pallor in her face had
deepened there was determination in
the blue eyes that brooked no interfer-
ence

  im going down she said quietly
it must be one of my riders ive got
to know

  she approached the group running
as she neared it vicious rage-filled
curses seared her ears it was deuce
coburn who saw her first and snapped
out a command that quieted the others
he turned and faced her

  i wouldnt go no nearer miss car-
lyle he said gruffly his face flushed
his eyes flaming ill tell yuh about it
its spider glick one of our boys
he-hes dead asked loma
yeah daid as a mackerel hes been
shot somebodyll pay for this an pay
plenty i got a hunch whos respon-
sible the boys are gonna back-track
the hoss and find out well make em
plenty sick they caint get away with
it

 they whom do you mean
those damned sandersons-father
an son bit out coburn theyre
overdue well settle the whole argu-
ment-now

 he would have turned away but
loma caught his arm

  no she said spiritedly ill have
no feud talk this is my ranch and
what i say goes youre not sure who
did this and youre not sure of the cir-
cumstances any one of you who
makes some move without my orders
is discharged i mean it
unconsciously loma had raised her
voice and it carried far the group
split open as a short wide bowlegged
rider pushed violently through lomas
first impression was that she had never
seen such a maddened depraved-look-
ing human before he had feral eyes
set deep under a sloping narrow brow
eyes that glinted as red as those of a
weasel on the kill some heavy blow in
the past had broken the fellows nose
and it spread thick against his face
with pig-like flaring nostrils
heritage of conflict



  his mouth was a narrow venomous
gash snarling and working his throat
and hands and wrists were hairy like
those of an ape two big guns sagged
at his thighs tied down his voice
when he finally got words past his
twisted lips held the same horrible
fury that had sounded in that first
blood-curdling yell

 whats that he barked we
caint go run down the polecat who
did this yuh say we caint hell
try an stop me-try an stop me no
lily-faced dame can tell joe colinga
what to do they killed spider-killed
my pal damn em an im gonna get
em an shoot their hearts out fire me
if yuh want to hell with the job
i wouldnt work for no outfit that aint
got the guts to fight for its own men
ill settle this job myself

  loma quailed before the fellows
fury she couldnt help it she
thought of some mad slavering animal
coburn caught colinga by the arm
trying to talk to him but the ape-like
rider jerked violently away and ran in-
to the bunkhouse to appear almost im-
mediately with a winchester rifle into
the loading gate of which he was stuf-
fing cartridges

  coburn turned to loma shrugging
she caught him up with a straight
scornful glance youre supposed to
be foreman o this ranch she cried
if you are stop that man stop him
-or go with him

  dont be a fool growled coburn
roughly colinga is on the kill yuh
caint reason with him now if i tried
to hed gun me ive seen him this way
once before an hes right in one
thing we aint worth much if we caint
right for our own punchers

  but he doesnt know argued loma
helplessly he doesnt know who did
it he might shoot some innocent per-
son

  not him thats one thing about
joe his first wildness will work off
in a minute after that hell turn wolf
-all wolf hell ferret out the trail
if it takes him six months in the end

hell get his man see-hes calmin
down already

  this was true colinga had quit his
mad jerkiness of movement and was
saddling up almost calmly but this
change to loma held an even worse
threat than his initial wild outburst

  and then a fresh yell from one of the
punchers turned ail eyes to a new
phase of movement cantering slowly
down the valley came the sandersons
eagle and link before them trotted a
badly blown whiteface two-year-old
eagle had his right hand up palm fore-
most in the age-old sign of the fron-
tier he wanted to parley

  intense excitement gripped the bar
c  riders they milled around un-
certainly joe colinga noting what
was going on came prowling forward
leaving his rifle leaning against the cor-
ral fence loma with sudden decision
advanced to meet the two riders
slowly almost grudgingly it seemed
deuce coburn slouched at her heels

  but molly downs totally unnoticed
by anyone slipped over to the corral
caught up colingas rifle and with it
held from sight in back of her ample
figure moved quietly up until she
stood just behind the guns owner

  the sandersons reined in coburn
rumbled eagle we got somethin to
show yuh link rope that critter
link swept down upon the steer
which tried to run but for the third
time in as many hours it was upset
violently by an unerring rope

  whats the idee growled coburn
ive saw critters roped an throwed
before

  eagle paid no attention to this at-
tempt at sarcasm take a look at that
brand im anxious to hear yore expla-
nation	
coburn hesitated running the tip of
his tongue along his lips it was loma
who stepped forward mr sander-
son she said evenly as owner of the
bar c  suppose you let me look at
the brand whats wrong with it
eagle stared at her grudging admi-
ration showed in his deep eyes if


ranch romances

yuh know anythin about brands yuhll
soon find cut miss but if yuh really
want me to say so ill tell yuh that
brand was originally a quarter circle
s its been blotted to a bar c -an
a botched job it is too

  lomas breath quickened as she bent
over the steer if what eagle sander-
son said was true here was a very seri-
ous situation indeed and she did
know something about brands-enough
to discern quickly through touch and
visual scrutiny that sanderson had
stated the case she straightened up
and turned on coburn

  mr sanderson is right she said
coolly how do you explain this mr
coburn

  i dont know nothin about it
growled the foreman plainly discon-
certed if yuh say its true i believe
yuh but it dont hold that i did it or
any of the rest of our boys mebbe its
a plant that somebody pulled to try an
start trouble between the sandersons
an us or mebbe its a frame-up
dont lie coburn barked old
eagle his eyes flashing that kind
of talk wont get yuh anywhere i ex-
pected yuhd say yuh didnt know any-
thin about it the same holds true for
yore whole damned crew but i
wanted to show yuh that link an me
got our eyes open an heres a warn-
ing for yuh if this happens again
im holdin yuh personally responsible
-an im cornin after yuh

  coburn shrugged his shoulders in a
show of bravado any time-any
place sanderson right now if yore
feelin that way

  eagle laughed harshly tough-an
brave aint yuh-with yore whole
pack behind yuh ive noticed yuh
sing damned low when yore alone
but thats aside from the main ques-
tion i come over here to lay the cyards
on the table-face up yuh know jest
how we stand now cmon link well
be goin

  jest a minute-you two

  these words came from the edge of
the group of riders a few yards back

of loma and coburn loma turned and
saw joe colinga there discolored teeth
bared in a snarl squat body crouched
hairy brutal hands dangling and
clutching close to his guns

  jest a minute he repeated im
askin you a question what dyuh
know about spider glick bein wiped
out

  it was link who answered as much
as you do about long andy bein mur-
dered colinga

  colingas answer to that was a rau-
cous curse and his hands blurred
downward he was fast much faster
than the average but at that moment
a stout keen-eyed matronly woman
was faster aunt molly downs watch-
ing colinga like a cat would watch a
mouse swept the gunmans winchester
out from behind her and with the same
movement whacked the barrel em-
phatically along the side of his bullet
head colinga went down in a heap

 take that you filthy brute
snapped aunt molly stepping back
levering in a cartridge and then level-
ing the rifle at the startled and as-
tounded group of bar c  punchers
ill shoot the first one of you to make
a crooked move

  for a moment dead silence reigned
then link sanderson laughed soft
and drawling missis downs he
chuckled my hats plumb off to yuh
that was the neatest thing i ever saw
yuh shore patted that jasper down
yuh either put a dent in his haid or
yuh bent that rifle barrel

  anyhow me an dad are thankin
yuh anythin we got is yores im
gonna shake hands with jim downs
every time i meet him hes shore to
be congratulated dad we better be
rammin out of here missis downs
holds the fort adios

  the sandersons whirled their horses
and rode away but link before he left
looked directly into lomas wide eyes
bowed tipped his hat and smiled and
to a man aside from the unconscious
colinga the bar c  stood and
watched them out of sight
heritage of conflict



that evening deuce coburn came
up to the house and asked to speak
to loma aunt molly let him into the
living room and took a chair to hear
what was going on coburn was plainly
ill at ease

  what is it you wish asked loma
quietly

  why i jest wanted to tell yuh that i
fired colinga blurted the foreman his
eyes downcast he had no business
goin on the prod like he did so i got
rid of him i talked it over with the
other boys an they figgered i was right
in doin it they also asked me to tell
yuh that theyre plumb satisfied with
their jobs here an want to keep em

  theyll toe the scratch an obey
yore orders without a question nat-
urally we were all kinda het up about
glick bein killed but in thinkin it
over we figger that whoever rocked him
off musta had a good reason spider
was a trouble hunter he jest took on
a hombre he couldnt handle

  i see said loma but ive a ques-
tion to ask how do you explain that
blotted brand the sandersons showed
us

  coburn shrugged i caint i got
an idee though if yuh care to hear it

  i would

  well i been thinkin that mebbe
glick did it yuh see a couple of
weeks ago him an me had a run-in of
sorts i put him in his place but i
know hes been sore about it he was
a good hater glick was i figger he
blotted that brand with the idee of let-
tin the sandersons find it so theyd
be on my neck about it which they
was

  mebbe while he was steerin the
critter out where itd shore be found he
run into either eagle sanderson or his
son they mustacalled glick an beat
him to the draw which he shore had
cornin to him if my idee is correct
sooner or later colinga is goin to start
somethin with the sandersons an i
dont want him a member of the bar c
 crew if he does it dont pay to fight
with yore neighbors

  no it doesnt agreed loma but
i heard you say out there today that
the sandersons needed cleaning out as
you put it what basis have you for
such a statement

  coburn looked uncomfortable put
it down that i was jest mad at the time
an not thinkin like i ought to run-
nin a ranch in this country is no snap
yuh got plenty of troubles an yuh got
to fight for what yuh get an then fight
harder to hang onto it a feller caint
be blamed for swallerin his haid once
in a while

  very well said loma well for-
get it for the time well see how the
future turns out you may tell the
men you are all on trial if you behave
yourselves and do as you are told
youll be kept on but the first defi-
ance of my authority will mean imme-
diate dismissal here is one ironbound
order that must not be violated leave
the sandersons alone understand
okeh with me miss carlyle de-
clared coburn in relief thanks a lot
ill tell the boys an see that yore or-
ders are carried out gnight

  as the door closed loma turned on
aunt molly triumphantly you see
fundamentally coburn and the other
riders are all right i wont have any
trouble with them theyre anxious to
please

 aunt molly snorted bosh child
use your head ive known deuce co-
burn a sight longer than you have it
isnt in him to turn so low an humble
unless hes scheming something an
the rest are just like him you want to
watch out for trouble its in the air i
can smell it

  loma sobered lets talk of some-
thing else ill have bad dreams as it
is

the following morning loma
donned her riding togs again and
set out to look over her newly acquired
domain she would have liked to have


ranch romances

molly downs accompany her but that
worthy lady begged off

  dont mention a saddle to me again
for a few days at least honey groaned
mrs downs im so stiff and sore
now i could scream

  so loma rode out alone and headed
down the valley it was a beautiful
day and eight hours of sound sleep the
night before had done much to dissi-
pate the depressing aftermath of
spider glicks killing

  while not having been raised on a
cattle ranch loma had sufficient judg-
ment and common sense to know that
her inheritance constituted an ideal
range water was unlimited the feed
was luxurious and heavy and timber
offered secure shelter at all times of
the year also due to the conformity
of the country cattle would not stray
very far from their initial range

  loma traversed the entire length of
the valley marveling at its extent
eventually she reached the lower end
of it where it fell away rapidly in a
great slope towards the southeast there
was a section of tableland again and
beyond that the durango desert se-
lecting the peak of a grassy knoll she
dismounted ground-reined her pony
and squatted cross-legged on the grass
staring out into the blazing infinity to
the south

  she was vaguely troubled just be-
fore going to bed the previous night
she had looked through a lot of old
tally sheets dated a few weeks before
her uncles death a hasty calculation
showed that slightly in excess of four
thousand head of stock were then car-
rying the bar c  brand in her ride
down the valley she had made a rough
count of the cattle she passed and the
best she could make of it was around
twenty-five hundred so she was won-
dering

  perhaps half an hour passed in si-
lence then her bronco lifted its head
and with pricked ears looked down the
long slope of tableland loma follow-
ing the look of the horse saw a rider
down there jogging slowly along scru-

tinizing the few head of cattle that were
there loma recognized link sander-
son

  her first thought was to take her
mount and slip back out of sight before
link saw her but this quickly passed
and a rebellious glow built up in her

  link was plainly checking up on
bar c  cattle evidently he was on
the search for more blotted brands
loma felt somehow that his implication
was that she was a thief the color in
her cheeks mounted as with quick deci-
sion she swung into her saddle and can-
tered down to meet him when she
came up he doffed his hat and smiled

  howdy neighbor he greeted her
fine mornin aint it

  it will do replied loma coldly
what brings you here

  just takin a look-see at some more
brands link admitted findin that
other one sorta made me curious

  any luck she took no trouble to
hide the sneer that came unbidden to
her tongue

  link looked at her very steadily
some he drawled quietly fourteen
by exact count

  the arrogance went out of loma
fourteen she gasped youre cer-
tain of that

  pretty shore my eyes are right
good

  loma was scarlet but she stood to
her guns im very sorry she mur-
mured that puts me in the position
of being a thief doesnt it

  not at all-not at all reassured
link staunchly but its time you an
me had a good talk lets light down
an take it easy

  suiting the words to action link dis-
mounted rolled a cigarette then
stretched his long lithe carcass on the
grass loma hesitated but a moment
before climbing down and sitting beside
him

  well she demanded

  im gonna talk straight out said
link briefly an please understand
that what i say is for yore own good
i know yore proud an a mite stubborn
heritage of conflict



besides but down deep yuh got plenty

of good common sense

  thank you said loma some of her
old stiffness returning suppose we
dispense with the personalities and get
down to facts i imagine you are going
to warn me about deuce coburn again
everybody except judge reynolds
seems to have it in for coburn

  link laughed softly yuh can fool
some folks but yuh caint fool em all
if itll make yuh feel better i wont say
a word about coburn ill jest tell yuh
somethin of what has been goin on an
yuh can judge for yoreself first off
dad an me have been figgerin lately
that some of our stock was missin

  jest how many haid we caint tell
until we look over our stuff at the spring
round-up which starts next week but
were shore we been losin some we
never did before-not while bert man-
nering was alive we alius got along
good with bert he was a square-
shooter findin that blotted brand yes-
terday sorta pointed the way an what
ive seen today just about cinches mat-
ters

  in other words cried loma the
bar c  has been rustling some of your
stock

  no said link gravely not the
bar c -which is you but the men
who are ridin for the bar c  shore
enough are

 but why should they do it how
can they benefit i own the ranch-
and none of them ever saw me before
yesterday morning they owe me noth-
ing why should they steal for me

  i thought of that admitted link
slowly an could only find one answer
tell me have yuh any idee how many
cattle was carryin the bar c  iron
when yore uncle died

  why-yes i think so i looked over
some tally sheets last night and i ar-
rived at a rough figure of something
over four thousand head

  that oughta be about right nodded
link thoughtfully it might be illu-
minatin to have a range count made
now somethin tells me there wouldnt

be near that many by a long sight
loma paled slightly what you
mean is that deuce coburn and my
other riders have been stealing from me
as well as you is that it

  exactly they probably figgered
that judge reynolds would be a long
time findin the heir to the bar c -
which he was durin that time they
intended to sell off the bar c  stock
an pocket the proceeds

  in that case why didnt they make
one big round-up and clean the whole
ranch out at one stroke

  because they mighta had a lot of
trouble disposin of the stock four
thousand haid is a sizable herd of cat-
tle it would have been sure to start
talk no matter where they drove to an
yuh caint alius find a buyer right off
who can handle a herd of that size but
by sellin a couple hundred haid at a
time they could do it an they been
doin it

  loma was fighting against this rea-
soning though something told her that
this lean bronzed young fellow was hit-
ting squarely at the truth of matters

  how about the figures coburn has
been furnishing judge reynolds

  link laughed quietly any liar can
figger the judge claims hes been
checkin up on coburn very carefully
yeah he has-by figgers that coburn
has been furnishin him nothin is
easier than jugglin a tally sheet any
fool can put down normal increase per-
centage if he knows cattle at all-an
ill give coburn credit for knowin cattle
all right

  the judge means well an hes a hon-
est ole coot but the only way to check
up coburns figgers is to make a thor-
ough range count which the judge
couldnt do if he tried

  loma surprised link i believe you
are right she admitted gravely i
rode down the valley this morning
checking up on the cattle i saw i do
not claim to know a great deal about
cattle raising but if there are four thou-
sand head of cattle on my range i dont
know where they are


ranch romances

  link straightened rolling another cig-
arette now we can get down to brass
tacks he exclaimed in satisfaction
coburn has been stealin yore cattle
hes been blottin our brand into yores
an stealin our stuff too we got to
think up a way to put a noose around
that jaspers neck

  loma shivered dont talk that way
weve had enough of death already
and by the way did you kill spider
glick

  link nodded his eyes narrowing
yeah it was him or me he figgered
he had me cold but his string played
out the wrong way

  and your conscience doesnt bother
you

  not a bit im moral shore that him
an colinga killed long andy when
we got andy home the other night we
looked him over an found rope burns
on his arms we savvy now how they
got his gun off him they roped him
from some sort of ambush disarmed
him then plain murdered him dyuh
expect me to feel sorry for rockin off
a human coyote whod do such a thing
hardly an one of these days im liable
to look colinga over in smoke

  she looked at him soberly he was
staring off into the distance his keen-
featured face set and implacable loma
thought that she had never met such a
proud resolute capable-looking man be-
fore and she had to admit his attrac-
tiveness-the clean hardy fiber of him
with abounding virility her heart
quickened slightly and color crept into
her cheeks

  if what you surmise is true i cannot
blame you for feeling as you do she
admitted quietly and i hope you do
not think that i vould sanction anything
crooked on my ranch

  link looked at her his eyes softening
the only thing i can think about yuh
is that yore the gamest proudest finest
little lady i ever knew were gonna be
friends you an me-good friends but
yore up against a crooked deck an yore
gonna need help to handle the play my
first idee was to tell yuh to fire yore

crew-all of em but i think yuhd bet-
ter hold on to em for a while

  well give that smart rooster co-
burn a little more rope an mebbe hell
hang hisself im goin on a trip for a
few days to check up when i get back
ill let yuh know how well act what
say we meet here again about-lemme
see-say next saturday thatll gimme
four days

  very well ill be here promised
loma

  link held out his hand lets shake
on that pardner

  there was a caressing note about his
last word and loma felt her cheeks
burn hotly but she shook hands
links palm tightened about hers and
he looked deep into her eyes blue and
shining

  yeah he murmured were gonna
be friends-mebbe more

  loma fled she sent her horse up the
slope at a run and did not look back
until she reached the mouth of the val-
ley even here her pride told her not
to look back but her heart told her oth-
erwise-and won the argument

  link stood just as she had left him
looking after her she could not make
out his features but he waved his hat
and loma waved back glad that the
friendly distance hid the luminosity of
her glance and the wild throbbing of
her heart then she spurred onward
out of sight

  she enjoyed riding back to the ranch
house a great deal more than she had
leaving it and her thoughts were not
about cattle or the troubles that faced
her at all instead they were all of
link sanderson

  hes nice buck she whispered to
her pony i like him awfully well but
that is a secret between you and me un-
derstand you rascal

  buck wobbled his ears lazily it was
okeh with him

link sanderson rode directly
back to the quarter circle s
ranch where he selected a fresh mount
saddled and then went up to the ranch
heritage of conflict



house he filled a couple of canteens
stuffed a pair of saddle bags with food
and rolled up a blanket

  with this meager outfit plus a booted
winchester rifle he went back to his
horse and strapped the equipment to his
saddle as he finished his father came
over from beyond the bunkhouse where
he had been superintending the reset-
ting of the tires on the round-up chuck
wagon

  where yuh haidin link he asked
noting the blanket and saddle bags

  down buckeye way was the an-
swer be gone for a couple of days i
reckon

  whats doin there

 dont know yet but i expect
a-plenty located fourteen of our
brands that had been run to a bar c 
this mornin

  what the word was a stentorian
roar that could have been heard half a
mile away fourteen goddlemighty
yuh jest forget about buckeye well
get the boys together an go over an
clean out that bar c  crowd to the
last man fourteen yuh say why-
why-

  eagle sanderson began to sputter
aimlessly so great was his anger link
smiled grimly and waited until his
father had calmed down a trifle

  well leave coburn an his crowd
alone for a while he drawled finally
we dont want to fly off the handle
jest yet lord only knows how many
more of our brands theyve altered
thats what i aim to find out besides
that im convinced theyve been lootin
the bar c  ever since bert manner-
ing died and link proceeded to tell
his father his and lomas suspicions

  as i see it he continued coburns
been jugglin the figgers hes furnished
judge reynolds with while drivin the
bar c  herd out bit by bit an sellin
em somewhere shore he couldnt
have brought em out through thunder
city an the pass down to healy like
bert mannering used to do an like we
do thatd been a daid give-away

  theres only one other way he could

have moved an disposed of them
thats by way of buckeye so im goin
down to buckeye to see what i can find
out when i get back i expect to be
loaded with enough dynamite to blow
coburn an his gang sky-high

  eagle sanderson thought this over
for a moment glowering at the ground
he nodded slowly thats sound rea-
sonin he admitted i reckon he
wouldnt have a heap of trouble gettin
rid of em in that country but be
careful son keep yore tracks cov-
ered an dont ride the tops of any
ridges

  dont worry i wont dad adios

  they shook hands and link rode
away he headed directly south
straight for the tableland that separated
the timber-clad range and the durango
desert reaching this he turned east
and set his mount to that steady shuf-
fling ground-eating jog which covers an
amazing amount of country without un-
due fatigue to either horse or rider he
made a dry camp that night and long
before daylight he was up again

  eastward he kept heading skirting
the neutral zone between the desert and
the cobalts with the rising of the sun
he became interested in the ground he
was traversing almost immediately he
murmured in satisfaction the sandy
earth showed indubitable signs of the
passage of considerable herds of cattle
there was no really fresh sign nothing
that wasnt at least two weeks old but
link was satisfied

  just before noon the country began
to change the desert was pushed back
farther and farther to the south and
west by a stretch of rolling well grassed
terrain across which link began to see
scattered herds of stock he passed
these closely studied the brands but
saw nothing out of the ordinary the
two most in evidence were a wineglass
and a rafter o

  ahead showed a low twisting line of
scrub willow beside a welcome pool of
water link unsaddled for an hour al-
lowing his mount the luxury of a good
drink a roll and a feed of grass for


ranch romances

himself he munched a cold flapjack or
two

  about mid-afternoon he struck the
town of buckeye it was a ramshackle
raw-boarded sort of place spraddled
around a single dusty street link
halted and dismounted at a building
before which several saddle animals
were tethered a sign over the door
identified the place as being the sunset
saloon

  link entered casually leaned on the
bar and had a glass of none too cold
beer while he drank this he looked
around five men sat at a card table
engrossed in draw poker

  one of them dressed in store clothes
with a pallid sphinx-like face link
identified as a professional gambler
the other four were riders clad in range
togs one of these four was patently
younger than the others-a boy of little
more than twenty so link judged
also in addition to being young this
player was far from sober

  not a bad-looking youngster link de-
cided with his smooth brown cheeks
curly yellow hair and blue eyes-eyes
that were hot and bloodshot now
though his mouth and chin were not
as much weak as they were wilful

  the young rider had just lost another
pot which the gambler was impassively
raking in the boy swore reaching
down in his jeans for more money

  damn it he growled his voice
thick from the liquor he had imbibed
aint there a hand i can hold thatll
win i had a queen high straight that
time an it wasnt worth shucks
smythe yuh shore yore dealin em
straight up

  at this link saw the gambler stiffen
while he stared at the boy with cold
unwinking eyes his right hand started
stealing inside the left flap of his black
coat link dropped his hand to his own
gun and was about to say something
when the player next to smythe a
coarse-featured dark-browed individual
jabbed the gambler with his elbow

  forget it he growled with what
was meant for a conciliatory smile

dont pay no attention to johnny hes
jest kid enough to say more than he
means besides its the liquor in him
talkin an his luck has been lousy
he aint won a single pot me id be
sore too but his luckll change pretty
quick deal em up pasco

  link watching closely saw the speak-
ers left eyelid droop ever so little and
the gambler relaxed okeh he said
thinly but dont make any more
cracks like that bidwell i deal cards
on the square

  the tension died away and the game
went on link turned to see the bar-
tender a fat red-faced sulky-looking
sort eyeing him speculatively link
laughed softly

  seemed for a minute like there
mighta been fireworks he drawled

  an a lot of em would have been
cornin yore way amigo had yuh gone
ahaid an butted in like yuh made the
move to do grunted the dispenser of
drinks yore a stranger so ill give
yuh a little tip buckeye is one hell of
a good town to mind yore own business
in

  a chill spark came into links clear
gray eyes though his smile still lin-
gered so-o mebbe yore right he
protested mildly but the kid is half
drunk an i never did cotton to seein
somebody sneak a gun on a half-drunk
kid least of all some tinhorn gambler
dont worry yoreself over me feller i
cut my eye-teeth quite some time back
the bartender chilled clear to his
heels by that spark in links eye sub-
sided and began polishing glasses indus-
triously link hitched up his belt and
strolled over to the card table standing
behind the boys chair

  the boy looked up met links
friendly grin and smiled in return hi
stranger he greeted stick right
where yuh are will yuh mebbe yuhll
change my luck which it shore could
stand

mebbe i will nodded link ill
give yuh all the moral support i got
that this arrangement was not en-
tirely suitable to the other players
heritage of conflict



showed in the scowls they bent upon
link but he paid no attention to them
as he rolled and lighted a casual ciga-
rette the game went on and as it pro-
gressed links eyes grew colder and
colder while his face took on that pe-
culiar hawkish ruthlessness that loma
carlyle had so often noted

  there was a reason for it link was
boiling inside for he was witnessing the
most bare-faced piece of crooked sharp-
ing he had ever run across the other
four players were plainly in cahoots and
the boy was the victim they were rob-
bing him blind

  link sanderson was old enough and
wise enough in the ways of the cattle
country to know that minding ones own
business is generally the safest course
but he possessed certain codes that
ruled him sternly one of those codes
was being violated right now and he
was determined whatever the outcome
might be to assert himself

  smythe the gambler had just dealt
the boy picked up his hand squinted
at it and tried to hide his exultation
the pot was opened by the man
on smythes left the coarse-featured
fellow and was jumped in turn by
the other two the boy kicked it
again

  you fellers are gonna have to pay to
see this hand he grinned foolishly

 smythe and the next two saw the
raise the man on the boys right saw
it and raised again the boy met the
raise and kicked it once more im
loaded this time he warned

  the others scowled but met the raise

  cards snapped smythe

  the boy looked up at link showing
his hand theyre gonna get a spurrin
this time-what he grinned

  link nodded thoughtfully they will
if yuh draw right he drawled looking
hard at the boys blue eyes i wouldnt
bob to that ace it never pays draw
two is my advice

  the boy stared at link blankly for
the hand he held was a full house kings
cn sixes there was no sign of an ace
in it but suddenly far back in those

blue orbs a glimmer of understanding
showed he nodded

  reckon yore right amigo i was
gonna bob that ace but ill try yore
advice this time my judgment seems to
have been rotten gimme two smythe
he tossed the pair of sixes into the
discard smythe hesitated and link
smiled grimly the gambler met links
glance if yore so anxious to have a
say about this game feller he rasped
why dont yuh buy chips an sit in
if i did that stack in front of yuh
would get smaller fast retorted link
easily go ahaid-the kid asked for
two give em to him

  smythe licked his lips fumbled at the
cards and flicked out two of the paste-
boards

  dont pick em up kid snapped
link sharply his gray eyes boring at
the gambler give him two more-off
the top this time

  the ensuing stillness could have been
cut with a knife smythe looked mur-
derous yuh didnt figger the kid would
draw did yuh smythe murmured link
softly yuh knew he had a pat full
house yuh gave it to him a-purpose
but his drawin two upsets yore own
hand them two would have given yuh
fours enough to have beat the pat hand
yuh dealt him so yuh tried to slip him
two off the bottom he dont want
them he wants top cyards give em
to him

  the last words cracked like a whip
and smythe cursing thickly did as he
was bid his own hand he threw into
the discard i thought this was a fair
open game of poker he sneered but
it looks like a hold-up

  right both times barked link
the kid thought it was a square game
but it wasnt it was a hold-up with
you engineerin things an the rest of
these coyotes helpin out yore dirty
play

  the next moment was furious brutal
action smythes hand licked under his
coat like the head of a striking snake
it came out filled with blue cold metal
as it appeared links own gun lashed


ranch romances

up and down in a flashing arc the
heavy barrel landed crushingly across
smythes face breaking his nose and
beating him to the floor in a senseless
heap

  the coarse-featured man hancock
was about to shoot when link drove a
slug through his right shoulder and he
toppled to the floor mouthing epithets
the other two pasco and jardine
spun out of their chairs snatching
guns

  for the first stunning moment the
boy had sat still his liquor-dazed brain
refusing to work but now he lurched
to his feet fumbling at his belt link
poised and ready saw pasco pulling
down squarely on the boys heart and
he threw a slug with lightning swift-
ness

  it was a center shot cutting the fel-
low down in his tracks pasco spun as
he fell instinctively shooting the lance
of flame from his gun almost seared
jardines face and that worthy went
down with him a blank empty look on
his face a bullet hole just under his
right eye then link whirled towards
the bar

  drop it he barked

  the bartender dropped the sawed-off
shotgun of awesome bore that he had
caught up from under the bar

  gawd gasped that worthy dont
shoot-dont shoot im peaceable

  yore a yellow-backed liar an a cow-
ard bit out link put yore paws on
the bar an keep em there

  silence fell except for the groaning
of the coarse-featured rider whose shoul-
der link had smashed the others were
still the boy coughed in the swirling
gunsmoke he looked at link cold
sober

  i reckon i owe yuh one pardner he
mumbled theyd have got me shore
pasco was holdin daid on when yuh
plugged him

  link nodded crisply yeah yuh owe
me one ill exact payment later jest
now we got other things to think about
how much did yuh lose in that crooked
game

  i dunno exactly mebbe two hun-
dred bucks

  take that much off that tinhorn
cyard sharp hurry up her well be
movin things are liable to be hot here
in another minute or two

  the boy fumbled over the senseless
gambler then stood up thisll dc he
gulped lets go

  they left the saloon ard et their
horses several men were apprzazhing
the place yuh lead snapped link
an step on it

  the boy lit out at a pounding r allop
with link at his heels shou- filleted
them then a few shots that e- -id
in another moment they were  -i ie of
town riding north

  link spurred alongside where yuh
haidin he shouted

  home answered the bey  to
the wineglass about seven rr les rm
here my dad owns it

  there was no pursuit at least n im-
mediate one but link felt tha hed
hear about the affair later thinking
things over now he was semes-i is-
gusted in getting mixed up r h a
scrape after all perhaps he szzad
have let the sharpers fleece the  i and
teach him a lesson he felt that -vsn
mission in the country would	be

much more difficult to perform b he
shrugged his shoulders the kid as a
likable sort

chapter vi

colinga tries his luck

the wineglass spread lay ir a big
basin along the foot of the cobalt
range and looked to link as he and
his companion drew up to it to be a
prosperous thriftily run outfit

  as they pounded to a stop before the
comfortable ranch house a rriddle-
aged man and woman stepped cut onto
the porch the woman had a gentle
motherly face kindly and serene the
man was of medium size rather stout
with a square blocky face the fighting
lines of which link immediately noted
and liked
heritage of conflict



  whats all the rush johnny de-
manded the man looking link over
keenly an whos yore friend
realizing that the boy did not know
his name link spoke up im link
sanderson from up thunder city way

vited me out

  mrs bidwell smiled and link fell in
love with her on the spot youll stay

up

  as he said this link caught bart
bidwells eye and gave him a light nod
then he started off for the corrals
leading his bronc bart bidwell
walked along with him while a scared
and doubtful-looking johnny brought
up the rear

  as soon as they were out of earshot
of the house link turned to bidwell
things happened in town he said
gravely serious things i didnt
want the missis to have to hear about
it a couple of jaspers got rocked off
a thirds got a smashed shoulder and a
tinhorn gambler named smythe has got
his face pounded in with a gun barrel
johnny an me were sorta in the mix-
up

  bidwell stared at the boy whose
eyes did not quail but met his own

wells arm dont say it sir he

set when link finished the rancher
nodded

  yuh come to the right place for in-
formation sanderson to my knowl-
edge pete hancock has bought two
sizable herds of bar c  stock it was
reasonable an didnt strike any of the
rest of us in this country as bein off-
color deals so i didnt pay much at-
tention

rock is the shippin point for all us

  link leaned over swiftly with cut-
stretched hand and gleaming smile
good kid well shake on that

things were quiet and on the sur-
face amicable enough around the
bar c  headquarters loma carlyle
with true feminine ardor and an eye
for beauty called on aunt molly
downs for advice and suggestions and
began outlining plans for beautifying
the house they discussed window cur-
tains some new pieces of furniture and
a rug or two
heritage of conflict



  loma got out pencil and paper and
began making a list of the necessary
purchases finished with plans for the
interior she turned her attention to the
out-of-doors and visualized some beds
of flowers

  these satisfactorily outlined she
called on deuce coburn and told him
of her wishes in turn coburn set his
men to work with pick and shovel and
superintended matters himself in
throwing up a small dam on the creek
above the house then ditching water
for irrigation down to where the flow-
ers would be

  on the morning of the second day
after lomas meeting with link a rider
came cantering up to the place bearing
a message from judge reynolds that all
the necessary legal papers were drawn
up and in readiness for her signature
so loma decided to go to town imme-
diately

  mrs downs concluded to end her
visit for the time convinced that loma
had nothing to fear for coburn and his
men were treating her with the utmost
respect so the two women rode away
together

  lomas business with the judge was
soon concluded it is all yours now
miss carlyle said the judge handing
the papers over to her and here is
your uncles bank book it shows a
balance of around thirty thousand dol-
lars in the bank at healy ive taken
all the necessary steps with jacobs the
bank president and you may draw on
that balance at any time now

  loma was amazed and breathless at
this news why-why thats a for-
tune she stammered i had no idea-
reynolds laughed you rate as a
pretty wealthy individual my dear he
beamed what with your ranch and
that bank balance you are more or less
fixed for life

  there was nothing in stock at the
store that satisfied lomas taste in win-
dow curtains or furniture so she sent
through an order for what she needed
as well as a wide miscellany of flower
seeds bulbs roots and rose cuttings

  she stopped in at the downs cabin
and had dinner with molly and her hus-
band jim-a kindly powerful man with
the great corded forearms of his black-
smith trade after exacting a promise
from mrs downs to come and visit her
again shortly loma galloped out of
town

  a great happiness surged through the
girl as she rode homeward her inheri-
tance was vastly greater than she had
surmised and she blessed the old ranch-
man who had willed his estate to the
orphaned daughter of a younger sister
she regretted that she had not known
bert mannering better in addition to
all this loma knew a subtle thrill at
the realization that she would shortly
be seeing link sanderson again

  she was too inherently honest to try
and bluff herself concerning the strange
feeling she had towards link her past
life had been a very stern and busy one
with the first consideration always be-
fore her of digging a living out of the
world for herself her mother had died
when loma was very young and her
father a mining engineer had been
killed in a cave-in when she was fifteen
leaving her with practically nothing

  loma had worked hard fitting her-
self to earn her own living and had had
no time for romance she had met her
share of men men who had offered their
attentions but none of them had moved
her in any way

  with link it was different from the
first he had intrigued stirred her he
was at once a clean-cut stalwart gentle-
man yet so starkly a rugged fearless
man lomas eyes brightened and her
cheeks flushed slightly at mere thought
of him

  on the point from which both of the
valleys were visible loma reined in
looking down across the sanderson
range immediately she picked out a
rider down there working slowly
through the scattered grazing cattle
she had a pair of field-glasses with her
which she had found in the house that
had evidently belonged to her uncle by
the aid of these she quickly identified


ranch romances

the rider as old eagle sanderson

  as she watched him the thought
came to her that link would look like
that some day erect grizzled poised
-a man upon whom the years would
rest lightly again she colored and
she laughed to herself with secret de-
light

  unconsciously her glasses swept here
and there coming to rest finally on an
opening in the timber on the ridge that
divided the valleys immediately she
stiffened she saw another rider down
there just in the act of dismounting
she saw him hit the ground draw a rifle
from the saddle boot then turn and
move off towards the edge of the timber
in a line that would bring him within
two hundred yards of where eagle
sanderson was riding

  lomas identification of this second
rider was immediate-that short wide
figure with the long dangling arms the
bowed legs and strange simian walk
joe colinga

  as surely as she knew her own name
loma guessed the import of the situa-
tion colinga hating the sandersons
with blind feral fury was going to dry-
gulch eagle sanderson colinga was
that sort-a killer without honor or
conscience or sense of shame link had
told her that he was positive colinga
and glick were the two men who had
murdered long andy certainly that
had been ruthless and cold-blooded
enough and now   

  loma wasted no further time in
thought she wielded a hefty quirt on
the amazed buck and went racing
towards the valley she did not follow
the winding trail instead she surged
straight down the steep slope crouch-
ing low in the saddle to keep from be-
ing swept from her seat by the clawing
brush thickets

  eagle sanderson had been about half
a mile distant when she first saw him
moving slowly up the valley perhaps
six hundred yards now separated him
from loma but this seemed like miles
to the anxious girl with a final snort
and a crash buck plunged clear of the

witch hopples and quaking asp and
raced into the open bosom of the val-
ley loma caught a little gasp of relief
as she saw that the old ranchman was
still in his saddle unsuspecting and at
ease

  yet at that very moment the flat
crash of a rifle echoed eagle sander-
son jerked sideways before some invisi-
ble force and slithered to the ground
his horse well trained and faithful
spun a few steps to one side and
stopped head upthrown ears pricked
towards the point from which the shot
came

  instinctively loma reined in to go
racing up to the fallen man now would
invite a shot at herself and there was
nothing she could do for eagle sander-
son a movement showed at the edge
of the timber off there in the hostile
distance

  joe colinga appeared walking
steadily forward callously levering in
another shell at first loma could not
understand this move then she re-
alized what colinga was about he was
going up to his victim to make sure
and so intent was he it was quite ap-
parent that he had not noted her ap-
pearance

  lomas first thought was to race
straight for him to ride in blind defense
of the fallen man but this changed im-
mediately as she saw colinga stop level
his rifle and shoot again she saw the
bullet striking high kick up dust just
beyond eagle sandersons outstretched
figure

  wild fury coursed through her it
was the most brutal cold-blooded thing
she had ever seen colinga was going
to drive more lead into the motionless
ranchman-going to make absolutely
sure

  loma swung to the ground dragged
out her own rifle and ran a little apart
from her bronco there she dropped to
one knee and swung the rifle into line
colinga was walking forward again he
stopped throwing up his gun hold-
ing a coarse bead loma pulled the
trigger
heritage of conflict



  she was astounded at the success of
her effort colinga went down like a
pole-axed bull and to lomas further
amazement eagle sanderson stirred
and crawled slowly to his feet where
he stood swaying

  loma ran back to the buckskin swung
into the saddle and raced up eagle
sanderson watched her come his grim
face set in a mask of pain his left arm
hung queerly limp and there was a red
stain spreading on his shirt over his
left shoulder

  loma set buck to a rearing halt slid
to the ground and ran up to the old
ranchman mr sanderson she cried
thank god he-he didnt kill you
after all

  despite his weakness and pain eagle
sanderson smiled grimly no lass he
growled thanks to you he didnt
ive got a lot to apologize to yuh for
yore true blue-an a grand young-
ster

  loma colored at his praise she got
a canteen from her saddle and stepped
close to him sit down she ordered
that shoulder needs some emergency
work when i get a bandage on it ill
get you home

  let that wait said the grim old fel-
low first im jjonna take a look to
make shore that buzzard of a colinga is
safe hes either daid as a mackerel or
jest creased yuh shot a little high
i could see where the bullet cut dust
out beyond him loan me yore shoul-
der

  loma did better than that she lifted
his sound arm about her neck encircled
his torso with her own left arm and put
all of her lithe splendid young strength
in supporting the ranchman as he
stumbled slowly forward to where co-
linga lay

  thought so grunted eagle he
aint daid yuh creased him over the
ear lucky we looked at him hell
come outa this in a hurry go get my
rope

  loma thankful in her heart that she
had not killed the renegade sped away
and soon returned with eagles riata

tie him up came the order ill
show yuh how

   colingas wound was little more than
a burn above his left ear but there had
been enough shock to the bullet to knock
him out momentarily already he was
beginning to stir slightly but loma
under advice from eagle sanderson
worked with expert speed half hitches
were thrown and drawn tight and
when colingas reptilian eyes flickered
and opened and he made his first effort
towards freedom loma saw that her
work was good the murderous killer
was trussed securely

  colinga began to curse sanderson
turned away come lass well be goin
now ill send some of the boys up
after him

   back at the horses loma insisted on
bathing and bandaging the ranchmans
shoulder her own silk neckerchief
formed the bandage then she helped
him into his saddle and rode close be-
side him ready to give him the support
of her arm again if it were needed

  grim old wolf that he was eagle
sanderson stuck it out until the quar-
ter circle s was reached but here
sleepy burch hurried out just in time
to catch his boss as the old fellow
fainted

   sleepys wild yell brought three other
riders get him to bed ordered loma
its serious but hardly fatal the bul-
let went completely through hes lost
quite a bit of blood though

  when their boss was safely between
blankets the riders turned on loma as
one man who did it-an how de-
manded sleepy

  joe colinga answered loma she
went on to give a brief description of
what had happened colinga should
still be there she ended mr sander-
son said he would send you boys after
him while youre about it youd bet-
ter have someone go to town for a doc-
tor ill stay and do what i can
well get the doc promised sleepy
with a meaning glance at the other
riders an well get colinga too
xmon gang

chapter vii

a midnight sortie

link sanderson arrived at the
quarter circle s just after sunup
the following mornmg lines of fatigue
were carven about his mouth and nos-
trils but his eyes though sunken
slightly still gleamed with their old
clear light of virility sleepy burch met
him at the corrals

  hells been poppin said sleepy
succinctly joe colinga tried to dry-
gulch the ole man

link stiffened tried yuh say he
barked harshly howd it happen
sleepy went into enthusiastic detail
when he finished link smiled dreamily
that girl is a wonder sleepy

  yore dang whistlin she is declared
sleepy vehemently her an eagle are
thickern blazes already i was in last
night after the boss came to an he
made her sit next to him an let him
hold her hand wished i had a slug-
through me he mourned lugubriously

  link laughed whered yuh put
colinga sleepy im gonna have a talk
with that jasper right now

  sleepys eyes grew evasive and he
scuffed the ground with a boot heel
well yuh see link-us fellers were
sorta hot by the time we got to him an
we got to arguin what we should do
an yuh know-here he looked up and
grinned-somewhere in that argument
danged if colinga didnt get hung yes-
sir he got strung up to a good stout
limb o course we felt sorry after it
was all over-but accidents do happen
sleepy yore right declared link
solemnly accidents do happen an
sometimes they sorta clear the air tell
the boys thanks-for me now i
reckon i better take a look at dad
link found his father partaking of a
little nourishment at the hands of loma
carlyle at sight of link lomas cheeks
burned slightly but she managed a very
manner-of-fact greeting

  your father had a little accident
she said quietly but hes doing
fine

  eagle smiled grimly at his son
dont let her steer yuh off the track
link he rumbled id been plenty
daid if it hadnt been for her

  so sleepy jest told me drawled
link smiling unspoken thanks at loma
an i hear that yuh two are high old
tillikums

  eagle chuckled yore doggone
right if i was twenty years younger
id marry that girl if i had to steal her
to get her but we understand each
other dont we lass

  loma smiled down at the old fellow
we understand each other very well
by the way what did your riders do
with colinga

  link busied himself with a cigarette
put him away for safe-keepin he
parried well dad im shore happy
that colinga didnt hold plumb center
as it is yore gonna miss a lot of fun
yuh mean yuhve located some-
thin demanded eagle quickly

  link nodded plenty jest about

set-up thatll put a finish to the whole
business so dont go to frothin an
foamin an agitatin yoreself jest take
things easy an get well in the mean-
time ill attend to mister deuce co-
burn an hfs crowd

  how yuh gonna do it persisted
eagle

  never mind yuh quit worryin
about it yuh had yore breakfast yet
miss carlyle

  loma shook her head

  then well eat together im gaunt
as a wolf

  over their breakfast loma surveyed
link critically you are not only
hungry but you look awfully weary
she observed i recommend about
twelve hours sleep for you

  i could stand it admitted link
but i want to take this opportunity of
thankin yuh for what yuh did for dad
we are neighbors arent we re-
torted loma lightly we should do
favors for each other goodness knows
you are doing plenty for me your en-
tire trip has been more for my interests
heritage of conflict



than for your own so say no more
about it

  okeh grinned link but that aint
gonna keep me from doin a lot of think-
in i been doin a lot of that anyhow
he added meaningly

  loma could not meet his eyes her
own glance fell to her plate and the
color mounted higher in her cheeks she
pushed back her chair and stood up ill
be getting along home now your
father is resting easily the doctor will
be out from town again this afternoon
to change the dressing on the wound
and after that ill come over and renew
it when necessary

  yore very very capable said link
softly i never knew there were wo-
men like yuh

  her laugh was a trifle shaky im
very ordinary really it just happens
that part of my preparation for being
a frontier school teacher entailed some
knowledge of emergency nursing i
wonder if youd have my pony saddled
ill do it myself said link an
ill ride home with yuh after that mix-
up with colinga i dont like to have yuh
ridin the range alone

  no protested loma emphatically
theres no need of that you get some
sleep if you really insist on having
someone accompany me let one of your
riders go-sleepy for instance hes
very nice she finished mischievously

  he better be growled link ill
cuff his ears if he aint okeh ill tell
him

sleepy burch was more than
glad to oblige and after seeing
loma safely to her own ranch turned
regretfully homeward sleepy was still
young enough to know the charm of
romance and while he realized perfectly
that an dreams he had on the subject
were entirely hopeless he found a
mournful pleasure in being in the com-
pany of this astounding girl

  a gal like her shore revives a mans
faith muttered sleepy as he jogged
back along the home trail

  to lomas surprise the bar c  was

apparently deserted on her return
there was no sign of life anywhere
at first a vague fear filled her so she
investigated thoroughly even to the ex-
tent of invading the bunkhouse here
she found her fears allayed for the place
was jammed with personal belongings
and equipment evidently coburn and
the other riders were merely off on some
job about the ranch

  she went back to the house and re-
alized she was very weary herself for
she had slept but little the previous
night this lack of rest coupled with
the strain and excitement of the shoot-
ing affray had sapped her strength so
she luxuriated in a hot bath then went
to bed

  it was dusk when she awakened
greatly refreshed while she was dress-
ing she heard the clatter and pound of
hoofs looking out of a window she
saw coburn and the others just riding
in from the southern part of the valley

  she cooked and ate a solitary supper
and was just finishing when a knock
sounded on the door she opened it to
admit coburn

  evenin miss carlyle he greeted
saw yore hoss in the corrals so i knew
yuhd got back from yore visit to town
i jest wanted to report ive had the
boys busy all day getting things ready
for the spring round-up we been comb-
in the timber an gettin what stock we
could out in the open

  i took the liberty of sendin a couple
of the gang into town for a few pack
loads of supplies well start the round-
up proper in the mornin shore but its
been a good winter for the stock i
never saw a herd in better shape an
the increase is way above normal

  loma carlyle in addition to her other
gifts was a passably good actress
therefore she showed no sign of her
real thoughts she expressed gratifica-
tion at the news but her thoughts were
along a line that would have amazed the
glib self-satisfied foreman

  she was drawing a mental comparison
between link sanderson and this fel-
low they were as wide apart as the


ranch romances

poles she concluded with link honor
and high purpose were the very essen-
tial things of existence he was the
sort who would speak the truth if it
meant hanging for it

  on the other hand deuce coburn was
nothing but a cheap slick crook steal-
ing from the ranch that had paid his
wages sheltered and fed him he knew
neither honor self-respect nor faith the
truth was not in him

  loma roused from her period of
thought to find coburn staring at her
fixedly and there was a leer in his eyes
that sent the hot color sweeping up her
throat she had donned a simple house
dress of blue gingham which unknow-
ingly enhanced the marvelous color of
her eyes and set off her vivid beauty
amazingly had coburn been but a
single order lower on the animal scale
he would have licked his lips

  it shore is easy to work for a boss
like yuh he muttered with what was
intended for an ingratiating look most
men would be plumb satisfied for a smile
or two instead of wages

  we wont discuss personalities if
you please said loma coldly you
must be weary after your long days
work

  thick-hided as he was coburn got
the hint and before the level chill re-
gard of lomas glance heeded it his
tone was surly as he growled a good
night but he left loma barred the door
behind him

  she frowned with disgust you
cheap lying thief she murmured i
am continually amazed that a man of
judge reynolds type should be taken
in by you the way he has thank good-
ness link sanderson isnt like him

  loma did not retire immediately on
the contrary she had never felt more
wide awake nor for that matter so
vaguely uneasy the night was so still
so brooding and somehow threatening

  she went to a window overlooking the
bunkhouse and corrals and sat there
she could see the lights of the bunk-
house and from time to time catch
snatches of indistinct voices

  in the timber above the house a coy-
ote was yapping presently from the
ridge on the other side of the valley
another of the slinking brotherhood re-
plied in kind and the night echoed with
the poignantly weird and wild sound
far down the valley a cow bawled
mournfully

  a terrible stultifying loneliness
gripped the girl she could not under-
stand it she had not felt like this be-
fore on all of that long lone trip from
lees ferry across the wild-horse
eadiands and the durango desert she
had never known the slightest touch of
loneliness yet here secure in her own
house with a dozen riders within easy
call she was fairly aquiver with this
foreign emotion

  the eastern rim of the world took on
a burnished silver tinge and presently
the moon crept into view round and
cold and pure it built intense shadows
under the trees but lit up the open
spaces almost like day

  through the stillness lomas ear
caught the measured clump of a slowly
moving horse her heart took a wild
leap perhaps it was link immediately
she knew better link would not be
over tonight but she smiled mistily
that sudden leap of her heart told her
all too plainly that what she was half-
way sure of before was now a cer-
tainty she was in love with link san-
derson

  she forgot the approaching horse for
a moment-a precious moment there in
the moon-glow while the first full glory
of her emotion flowed over her she
clutched the thought avidly hungrily
and her lips parted in strange ecstasy
as she looked through wide glorified
eyes across the night to where link
sanderson lay sleeping

  the sound of a coarse whiskey voice
jerked her back to stern realities hey
coburn came the call

  the bunkhouse door swung quickly
open and deuce coburn stepped out

  who is it he rasped suspiciously

  me-texas jack send somebody
to take care of my bronc im daid
heritage of conflict



fagged jest got in from buckeye pete
hancock sent me im-

  shut up snarled coburn yuh
must be drunk-bawlin out things of
that sort for the whole world to hear
shut up-an get inside

  texas jack muttered a string of
curses but subsided loma saw him
follow coburn into the bunkhouse a
moment later another rider stepped out
and led the newcomers horse off
towards the corrals

  for a long time loma was motion-
less but her thoughts were racing
texas jack she remembered him now
as the drunken brute who had insulted
her that first day in thunder city and
whom link sanderson had punished for
the insult with swift ruthless savagery

  but what was he doing here now
and what news could he bear to co-
burn from hancock of buckeye

  through her mind flitted the signifi-
cance of what link sanderson had said
to his father and to her hancock was
the man who was in the deal with co-
burn on the stolen cattle this must
have something to do with that phase
of affairs again link had just re-
turned from the buckeye country per-
haps his mission down there had been
correctly guessed at

  daring ideas pulsed through loma
she wanted to hear what else texas
jack had to tell coburn and there was
just one way to do it she ran to where
her saddle bags hung extracted her slim
but deadly  colt then slipped out-
of-doors and poised in the shadows un-
der the trees

  here she waited until she saw the
puncher return and enter the bunk-
house the one who had taken care of
texas jacks horse then picking her
way from shadow to shadow she scur-
ried down to the corrals from the
shelter of these she whisked across an
open stretch into the black shadow
thrown by the bunkhouse

  there she halted resting a moment
for her breathing to become normal
presently she inched along the wall
towards a partially opened window just

beside this she crouched motionless for
the voices of the men inside were clear

enough

 texas jack was speaking that
damned link sanderson shore threw a
jolt into things down in buckeye he
butted into a game of cyards that han-
cock was in hancock a cyard sharp
named smythe an two of hancocks
riders were cleanin out some kid
smythe wasnt slick enough with the
pasteboards to fool sanderson an san-
derson called him guess he got purty
rough

  anyhow when the ruckus was over
smythe had his face pushed in from a
gun barrel hancock was crippled an
his two riders daid naturally han-
cock is plenty sore he wants sander-
sons scalp an says hell pay plenty for
it but he guessed what sanderson
might be down there for an he sent me
up here to warn yuh to watch yoreself

  pete hancock aint guessed anythin
i didnt know came coburns answer
things are gettin too tight around
here for comfort so me an the boys
figgered to make one last big drive-
a drive thatll clean this damn ranch
from one end to the other we were
out all day long today combin the tim-
ber an concentratin the stock in the
lower end of the valley

  tomorrow on the bluff of startin
round-up well pick up everything else
we can includin all the quarter circle
s stuff we can get our hands on an
tomorrow night we light out by morn-
in well be a long way towards buckeye
and by the time these thick-haids
around here wake up to whats hap-
pened well be safe on hancocks range
what dyuh think of it

  texas jack seemed to be considering
well he said slowly id say it might
work all right if the sandersons were
out of the way this lone female boss
of yores dont amount to a whoop o
course as far as puttin up a fight is
concerned but them damned sander-
sons   

coburn laughed brutally forget
the sandersons i got joe colinga out


ranch romances

lookin for them joes got a little grub
an a blanket an hes jest prowlin
around waitin his chance dont be
surprised if yuh hear of one or both of
the sandersons bein dry-gulched

  joell make a better man at that work
than spider glick spider was too proud
of himself he felt nobody could beat
him to the draw an he liked to get his
men at close range alius said he liked
to see em kick but his foot shore
slipped on his last try joes more pa-
tient hell get them buzzards see if
he dont

  texas jack cursed ill shore buy
him a drink if he does an say i got
an idee long as were gonna clean this
range of cattle tomorrow night why not
lug that gal along too the stuck-up
little devil id like a chance to tame
her some

  a chorus of protest arose nothin
doin came a voice that loma recog-
nized as belonging to dopey we dont
want no woman mixed in this cattle
stealin is bad enough but woman steal-
in is out yuh try that an i quit the
whole game cold

  there were several additions to
dopeys promise by others and texas
jack subsided

  loma waited to hear no more what
she had listened to set every outraged
fiber of her body quivering with anger
something indescribably savage pulsed
through her at the moment she felt
that given opportunity she could have
shot down the entire crowd of traitor-
ous thieving riders whom she had
fondly believed for a short fatuous pe-
riod to be toiling in her interests

  but she was too level-headed to waste
time in useless regrets and futile anger
action was imperative-intelligent ac-
tion soft as a shadow she whisked
away from the bunkhouse to the cor-
rals thence back to the ranch house
here she swiftly changed to shirt and
overalls and boots leaving a lone light
burning in her room she belted on her
revolver took her rifle from where it
stood in a corner and slipped out into
the night once more

  this time she left on the opposite side
from the bunkhouse circled far below
the corrals then cut directly southwest
across the valley the world was still
and rapturous beneath the silver sheen
of the moon and under ordinary cir-
cumstances loma would have been en-
tranced by it for in her normally lay
a deep appreciation and response to the
majesty of nature

  tonight however she was coldly
practical

  she welcomed the moonlight merely
because it made her progress easier
straight across the valley she headed
aiming for the timber-shrouded ridge
that separated her range from that of
the sandersons

  she had first thought of using a horse
but discarded the idea before the reali-
zation that to do so would entail a big
risk of discovery by going this
way on foot she had little fear of de-
tection

  in her lungs the crisp night air burned
-pure and cold and energizing the
night was magic vital the timbered
ridge moved rapidly closer before her
quick firm stride then she was into it
and climbing

  it was dark under the towering trees
and her pace was of necessity slower
but she scorned to rest driving steadily
onward before the stimulation of need
and the electric fountain of perfect
health and strength underfoot lay a
springy carpet of pine needles and the
moist night air was heavy with pungent
throat-tingling essence of balsam

  the long trek ended under the cold
brilliant stars of early morning the
bulk of the ranch buildings of the quar-
ter circle s rose before her still and
slumbering thoughtful of old eagle
sanderson and his need of quiet
and rest she went to the bunkhouse
the door was open and through it
drifted the sound of heavy breathing
and subdued snores

  sleepy she called softly sleepy
burch

  there came a stir from inside the
clfck of a gun lock
heritage of conflict



  who is it sounded sleepys voice
hard and suspicious

 loma carlyle hurry ive got
something to tell link

  she smiled at sleepys murmured
curse of utter amazement and she heard
the thump of his boots as he donned
them he stepped out of the doorway
tousled and disheveled from sleep and
hurried dressing

  you he exclaimed miss carlyle
holy smokes whats this all about
anyhow

  you can listen while i tell link get
him down here-quick

  sleepy headed for the main house at
a clumsy run still dizzy and befogged
with sleep loma followed after him
slowly by the time she reached the
steps of the porch link emerged with
sleepy at his heels

  links eyes seemed to flame in the
darkness and their contact sent lomas
heart to thudding what is it loma
he asked tersely

  link maybe you think im crazy
but i thought you should know immedi-
ately then she went on to tell of the
arrival of texas jack at the bar c 
and of what she had overheard between
him and deuce coburn

  link listened intently when she
finished she found that he had captured
both of her hands and was pressing
them tightly this is what i expected
would happen-an what i hoped for it
means that well catch em in the act
in our own time and way an by bring-
in the news immediately yuhve jest
guaranteed the success of my plan

  sometime-later-ill tell yuh what
i think of yore pluck and common sense
little lady there never was another
like yuh

  to still the thunder of her heart and
cover her confusion loma spoke again
link that lying cur of a coburn set
joe colinga after you and your father
deliberately sent him out to dry-gulch
you both and he sent spider glick be-
fore colinga oh i know i should not
feel this way maybe it is vicious and
unwomanish but i could see men like

that wiped out of existence and never
know a qualm of pity

  i savvy said link quietly yore
entitled to feel thataway i dont think
none the less of yuh for it an well
take care of mister coburn in our own
good time an way sleepy-and here
his voice became crisp and forceful-
yuh got a long ride ahaid of yuh-
startin now

  grab yoreself a relay of about four
broncs yore haidin for buckeye
north of buckeye lays the wineglass
spread bart bidwell runs it find him
an tell him the drive is on salt crick
is the place hell understand what to
do-an hes expectin yuh git a wiggle
on ill make yuh up a pack of grub
while yuh get the broncs

  sleepy was a good soldier he took
his orders literally and without argu-
ment he hurried off to the remuda
corral while link led loma into the
ranch house where he lit a lamp and
showed the way to a food storeroom
off the big kitchen

  the quarter circle s cook slept in the
bunkhouse with the other men and link
did not bother him he selected an
empty flour sack and stuffed it with
food then he went down to the corrals
again sleepy was ready he tied the
food on behind the saddle looped a
couple of canteens over the horn and
swung astride

  adios folks he drawled ill be
seein yuh

  he surged into the night the relay
of ponies clattering after him

  as the sound of sleepys departure
died away link turned to loma that
long walk shoulda give yuh an appetite
he drawled whimsically what say ve
scare up a little breakfast then ill sad-
dle a couple of broncs an take yuh
home

  we got about three hours before
daylight yet an to play safe we want
coburn to think yuhve been home all
night if he was to investigate an find
yuhd disappeared he might get sus-
picious an not make that drive-which
would upset all our plans complete


ranch romances

 i am hungry admitted loma
this will be fun

  together they cooked the meal and
ate it not a great deal was said a
strange thrilling constraint lay between
them it was as if both were unwill-
ing to trust their emotions fate chance
or something of the sort was drawing
the lives of these two young people
closer and closer together welding them
in bonds of mutual regard and affection
both realized this and a gentle shyness
blanketed them

  they were still silent as they rode
away toward the bar c  but it was
a silence in which both were queerly
enough content not until they had
crossed the ridge between the two val-
leys and were on the fringe of the open
country beyond did link speak he had
reined in and was staring out to where
the bar c  buildings stood

  yuh better go on foot from here he
decided everythin seems quiet
enough an when yuh get there jest
flash a light twice from a window on
this side thatll tell me yuh got there
safe

  he wanted to say something more
something that wasnt so matter-of-fact
but for some reason the words would
not come the same constraint lay over
his companion

  good night link she said quietly

  loma slipped to the ground and hur-
ried off disappearing in the haze link
dismounted and squatted on his heels
rolling a cigarette not a sound came
to him from the buildings and after a
little time a light flickered twice
through the night he nodded and stood
up as though to mount but he shook
his head slowly

  no he muttered yuh stay right
here link sanderson until yuh see that
crowd of polecats move out mebbe that
dirty rat of a texas jack put over his
argument with coburn about takin
loma with em im stayin until im
shore of it

  and stay he did sitting with his back
against the bole of a huge sugar pine
waiting with the patience of an indian

while the day slowly grew out of the
night and the dawn began dissipating
the mists he saw the renegade riders
of the bar c  rise and go about their
preparations

  and finally he saw them leave riding
south along the center of the valley
when they had disappeared with texas
jack in their midst link rose stiffly
mounted and cut back over the ridge
towards home

chapter viii
coburns raid

all day long the renegade riders
of the bar c  worked feverishly
the cattle they had bunched in the val-
ley the previous day had scattered some
but not badly these were once more
bunched and started moving towards the
lower end of the valley leaving them
in the care of three of his men coburn
sent the rest into the timber again to
pick up any stragglers that had been
overlooked the day before

  this is our last big chance at the
gravy he growled we dont want to
overlook any of it

  there was no complaint from the rid-
ers the more cattle they threw into
this rustled herd the bigger their cut
of the profits would be so they
spared neither themselves nor their
horses

  coburn had collected a small remuda
of saddle mounts and as soon as any
bronco showed signs of exhaustion the
rider would race in to the remuda and
pick a fresh horse these men despite
the crooked twist in their make-up were
top-hands every one-men who knew
their business-and there was nothing
overlooked

  coburn detailed himself and texas
jack as guards he selected as his own
point of outlook a spot on too of the
dividing ridge between the bar c 
and the quarter circle s ranges from
this spot by the aid of a pair of field-
glasses he could scrutinize all that went
on at the sanderson ranch but he could
find no evidence of untoward activity
heritage of conflict



at that place after one long look he
lowered the glasses with a sneer

  yuh pose as bein such a wise jasper
link sanderson he muttered but
this is shore one time when yore sound
asleep at the switch time yuh wake
up to whats goin on well be a long
way from here-too far away for yuh
to do anythin about it an some day
later on mebbeso well meet again yuh
an me ill finish the score then if joe
colinga dont beat me to it

  at noon the rustlers stopped for a
short bite to eat then resumed their
toil and when sundown came and they
gathered around coburn the latter
knew by the size of the herd before
them that the bar c  range had been
combed clean

  we eat an rest for an hour said
coburn then we hit the trail i know
yuh fellers are tired but this aint the
time to stop

  tired-hell spat one of the riders
ive rode thirty-six hours at a stretch
moren once in my life-an for jest
what measly wages i was drawin with
a real stake in sight ill ride fifty if i
have to i reckon the rest of the gang
feel the same

  by the nods and grunts of approval
it was plain that he had expressed the
sentiments of the rest a hard game
crowd mused coburn that would stand
a lot of stopping to keep them from put-
ting this thing over he thought of
link sanderson again of loma carlyle
and particularly of that fatuous old fool
of a judge reynolds he barked a short
sneering laugh of contempt

at the quarter circle s ranch head-
quarters link sanderson was
moving leisurely enough he met the
men at breakfast and told them to stick
around close to the ranch and put their
riding equipment their rifles and gun-
belts in good shape when questioned
about the absence of sleepy burch link
merely grinned

 yuh know said shorty pierce
scrubbing a cleaning patch industriously
up and down the barrel of his winches-

ter yuh know ill swear to gosh that
i heard somebody come an get sleepy
outa bed early this mornin i didnt
wake up complete but i heard em jest
the same-sorta in a dream like

  yuh would snorted bob rennifer
shortys bosom pal and perpetual tor-
ment yore alius havin some sort of
pipe-dream i never seen one of these
little sawed-off squirts like yuh that
wasnt full of fits an starts yuh prob-
ably heard tim snorin-thats what yuh
heard

  bob winked at jim staley a gaunt
old puncher with little twinkly eyes and
a grave mahogany-colored face jim
nodded  twas either that or the
ghost of joe colinga was spurtin him
bob agreed the old puncher gravely
yuh know i was plumb shocked the
way shorty acted day before yestiday
he was plumb bloodthirsty the way
he pulled on the rope when we strung
up colinga sorta horrified me yuh
might say

  shortys round pink-cheeked face
turned a brick red truth be known
shorty had been a trifle sick at the spec-
tacle of stern and ready justice the
quarter circle s punchers had meted
out on the murderous renegade

  yah he retorted yuh jaspers
think yore smart dont yuh-jest be-
cause yuh got a set of innards as hard
as nigger-haid rocks but if yuh know
so much where is sleepy answer me
that if yuh can

 bob looked at shorty in pitying
amazement why dont yuh know
shorty shucks thats shore too bad
sleepys gone to kalamazoo to borrow
a left-handed monkey wrench

  shorty tossed his winchester onto his
bunk and stamped to the door of the
bunkhouse there he turned yah
he blurted yah yuh long-laiged
hoss-faced drink of alkali yah-h
with that final broadside he stumped
off to the saddle shed with all the dig-
nity his five-foot-three-inch carcass
could muster jim staley curled up on
his bunk convulsed with silent laughter
bob rennifer grinned from ear to ear


ranch romances

jose salvatore a lithe sunny-faced
young mexican vaquero who possessed
the undying friendship and admiration
of every man on the ranch smiled
gently

  behind this bantering front every one
of them knew that serious business of
some sort portended and their prepara-
tions were thorough and painstaking
by mid-afternoon they were ready not
a detail overlooked and now link
gathered them about him again

  he told them what was in the air
and laid his plans before them we
could go over right now an bust this
thing up he concluded but it would-
nt get the results i want coburn could
take the stand that he was merely pull-
in a round-up in the usual way an
while wed know different we couldnt
prove it

  as it is well let em make the drive
theyll start tonight well let em go
all night an well be follerin em come
mornin well have em where we want
em coburn wont have an alibi then
thatll hold water well have him cold
an once an for all well clear the at-
mosphere in these parts

slowly supposin when we come up on
em they dont elect to make a fight of
it link mebbe theyll jest light right
out an keep on runnin well get the
cattle back but we wont do much harm
to their scurvy hides

  link nodded i thought of that jim
an ive made arrangements thats
where sleepy is i sent him off early
this mornin to carry word to bart bid-
well who runs the wineglass spread
north of buckeye barts a friend of
mine an will know what to do hell

the willows along salt crick an
should coburn lose his nerve an make
a run for it bartll be waitin for

  shorty turned on bob and jim tri-
umphantly yah-yuh wise aigs did-
nt i tell yuh i heard somebody get
sleepy out early this mornin think
yore wise dont yuh

  yuh win shrimp grinned bob
yuh win

  yore doggoned right expanded
shorty i alius win when do we
start link

  no hurry drawled link if we
dont leave until midnight we can come
up to em easy bjr dawn they can move
jest so fast with the stock so seein
as yuhll have to miss a lot o sleep to-
night yuh might as well store up some
while the chance is good

in the crisp invigorating chill of
night link and his men saddled up
there was no delay in their departure
link took the lead and they swung
south and east circling the lower end
of the ridge that divided the two val-
leys as they struck the tableland and
turned directly east a low rumbling
overtone came to their ears it was the
combined complaint of cattle under
forced drive

  link reined in rolling a cigarette
theyre jest clearin the lower end of
the bar c  range he announced we
got a lot of time take it easy

  they killed a good half hour before
moving on again then dropped in di-
rectly behind the stolen herd some half
mile or more in the rear the warm
bovine smell of the cattle hung thick in
the damp air link called to jose sal-
vatore his mexican rider

  jose yore far an away the best scout
in this crowd yuh sneak on ahaid an
get a line on that gang see if theyre
actin in any way suspicious they may
have put out a rear guard of some sort
so to speak an we dont want to go
blunderin into a ambush

  joses white teeth gleamed and he
cantered quickly off link held his own
pace and that of the others down to a
slow walk the hours wore away jose
returned to report that the raiders had
no rear guard out but were concentrat-
ing every man on the task of keeping
the herd moving as fast as possible

  the complaint of the cattle was con-
stant and now and then echoing faintly
came the shrill high-pitched yell of a
heritage of conflict



rider urging the bellowing herd on-
ward

  shore mused link coburn aint
complimentin my good sense any he
musta figgered to ketch me sound
asleep well he alius was powerful
shore of himself hell learn his lesson
too late

  when dawn gray and chill broke
over the world the herd had passed the
point where the tableland ran down to
the edge of the desert links wariness
increased to be seen now would spoil
everything therefore he led the way
to the base of the cobalts and into the
timber

  well skirt along through here he
explained well be able to keep closer
this way without the chance of bein
seen

  whenre we gonna pop the whistle
link asked shorty impatiently
them jaspers are gettin plumb in the
open now

  waitll we hit salt crick answered
link

  bob rennifer looked at his stubby
partner yuh musta had a change of
heart shrimp whatcha been doin-
drinkin tigers milk never saw yuh so
full of hell an leather bet the first
time a gun goes off yuhll beat it fer
parts unknown

  oh-yeah snapped shorty well
ill tell the world that if i do ill be
plumb strangled on the dust yuhd be
kickin up while leadin the way

  the sun rose and climbed upward
the distant herd and the rustlers were
almost hidden by the dust that funneled
into the air in the distance a low wind-
ing line of green showed-salt creek

  link reined in again his manner brisk
and sure bob you and shorty cut
straight south until yuh get well beyond
the herd then turn east an move up
fast jose and jim take this side move
up on the flanks an dont let anybody
break through ill hold the center my-
self this job is one thats been a long
time overdue we might as well make
it a good one while were at it an
that crowd would prefer lead to a rope

any time i would myself savvy what
yore to do

 the riders nodded good one
thing more-bart bidwell an his boys
are out along the crick dont go shoot-
in into them willows this oughta be
over quick lets go-an good luck

  the long wait was over and action
ahead of them at last the trap had
been set the quarry had entered it and
now came the final act of springing that
trap low in their saddles links men
raced away

  link had taken the most dangerous
position himself he did it without any
thought of heroics it was simply the
creed he had been born and bred to
he knew that when the surprise first
came coburn and his men would surge
straight ahead

  but the reception they would get at
the creek would make them rebound
like a wave striking a rocky shore
what was left of them would come
pounding back at him some might cut
out to the flanks but would turn in
again when they met a reception from
bob and shorty jose and jim

  the five of them had just about at-
tained their desired positions before dis-
covery came this was announced by
a snarling report or two that sent lead
skittering in dusty paths around shorty
and bob these two wasted no time in
returning the fire from the opposite
flank jose and jim opened up

  caught between two fires coburn re-
acted as link had figured he would he
called his riders about him decided that
as far as the cattle were concerned it was
a lost cause then thundered out straight
ahead for salt creek there dismay and
fear bit deep for a volley of long-range
rifle fire came that cut down two men
and a horse

  the horse happened to be coburns
own he kicked free of the saddle as
the beast went down and caught one of
the mounts that had lost a rider it was
dopeys horse dopey himself was
crumpled up in a tangled heap at the
final end of a crooked trail that he had
traveled all his life


ranch romances

  coburn tried the north flank then
figuring that if he could reach the tim-
ber he could make a getaway he lost
another man at this before the deadly
accuracy of jim staleys winchester
another of coburns band racing south
paralleling the creek found himself
cut off by the alert shorty and bob
he fought it out cursing and des-
perate

  shorty went down one side of his
head gory bob rennifer with a whim-
pering curse tore down on the rustler
shooting at every jump of his horse at
two hundred yards he found the target
and the rustler slumped then bob
whirled back to his partner he choked
out broken words of thanksgiving when
he found that shorty had merely been
creased

  so far link had fired not a single
shot in fact he had seen no one to
shoot at but he could chart the course
of battle easily by the sound of the guns
he was especially gratified by the vol-
ley that came from the willow-shrouded
reaches of salt creek

  that about settles it he muttered
it was the one big gamble of my play
if sleepy hadnt been able to git bid-
well on the job then our birds would
shore enough have slid through to a
getaway as it is 

  his eyes smarted from the dust that
billowed into the air in ever thickening
clouds the cattle were moiling and
bawling in fright and confusion yet
their thirst was stronger than any
mere fear of gunshots and their prog-
ress towards the water in salt creek
was steady

  abruptly the cattle split and through
the dust came two riders leaning far
over and spurring madly they did not
see link until they were within ten
yards of him one set his bronco to a
rearing halt the other swerving aside
and pounding past both began shoot-
ing

  links own gun winked back in mea-
sured reply the rider who had halted
went down in a welter of dust and
hoofs and link his left arm limp and

dead and bloody whirled after the last
fugitive

  it was deuce coburn craven and ven-
omous out of the dust thundered link
and coburn the latter some hundred
yards in the lead links face white
and drawn with pain was nevertheless
set in a mask of relentless iron his eyes
narrow and cold

  for a time coburn held his own but
his mount was tired from the work of
the day before and the all-night drive
links bronco was the stronger and be-
gan cutting down the distance t etween
them coburn spurred and quirted
madly but to no avail with inexorable
surety link drew up

  coburns face looking back over his
shoulder was white and snarling he
began shooting throwing shot after shot
in a wild effort to stop this figure of
retribution coming steadily on link
held his fire knowing he would need it
later

  something whisked links hat from
his head sending it spinning he
scarcely noticed it and then he saw
an amazing thing one that sent a surge
of disgust through him coburn dragged
his badly blown horse to a stop slid to
the ground and stood there his hands
high over his head coburn had turned
yellow-quit when a showdown was in-
evitable

  link reined in beside the craven his
gun bearing steadily on coburns heart

  dont shoot gasped coburn for
gawds sake dont shoot i quit i
give in ill get all the cattle back if
yuhll gimme a chance-just a chance
to square myself thats all i ask dont
shoot

  for the moment link said nothing
though his tight lips curled in scorn
he heard other riders pounding towards
him and a high-pitched yell told him it
was his own men jose salvatore and
jim staley whirled up

  tie him up jim snapped link

  coburn did not protest he merely
shook and whined his last vestige of
courage absolutely gone by the time
jim had finished other riders came rac-
heritage of conflict



ing with sleepy burch and bart bid-
well leading the way and presently
came bob rennifer supporting a con-
scious but very sick shorty in his
saddle

 none of em got by us link
shouted sleepy how about it

  i reckon it was a complete clean-up
said link quietly this rat is the last
an hes tryin to beg off bob how bad
is shorty hurt

  bob was grinning in relief not too
bad hes got a hard haid the shrimp
has it turned that slug same as a hunk
of iron might but yuh got a bad wing
yoreself

  its nothin said link ill make
out now then men what dyuh think
we oughta do with that he nodded
towards coburn

  thats easy link said jim staley
coldly he planned this steal and the
rest paid he oughta pay too i sug-
gest a rope

 no gasped coburn not that-
not that ill square everythin-ill
square it i say

 yuh caint rasped link yuh
caint bring back long andy an i know
yuh set spider glick an joe colinga
after him same as yuh set em after
dad an me no yuh caint square a
thing coburn the rest of yuh boys
have heard what jim suggested whats
yore sentiments on the matter

  the answering chorus spelled doom
to coburn for a moment link thought
the fellow was going to crumpie right
where he stood but hot sour hate gal-
vanized him to some semblance of
courage he cursed and spat his red
eyes fixed on link

  damn uh sanderson he shrieked
yuh think yuhve won dont yuh
yuhll find out different ever hear of
texas jack well where is he he
started out with us but he was crazy
over that carlyle dame an hes gone
back after her yuh lose after all
links head jerked up and he whirled
to the others whos got the fastest
and freshest hoss he demanded his
voice husky quick i want it

-ranch romances-first sept

  sleepy slipped to the ground this
broncll qualify link but man yore
wounded let me go-let any of us go
we-

  gimme that hoss snapped link
im all right

  before the rest could speak again he
was in the saddle and racing away back
to the bar c  range

       chapter ix
       hungry hearts

texas jack crouched in the tim-
ber on the main slope of the co-
balts a quarter of a mile above the bar
c  ranch buildings his eyes small
glittering and bloodshot stared down-
ward with the set feral patience of
some beast of the wild he had broken
away from coburn and the rest of the
raiders shortly before midnight co-
burn had cursed him roundly on hear-
ing of his plans but the renegade had
insisted stubbornly

  if yuh dont finish this drive with
us yuh wont come in for any cut on
the profits coburn had threatened

 texas jack had shrugged keep
yore profits had been his answer
im goin back

 coburn cursed with greed had
finally acquiesced he concluded to say
nothing to the others planning to
pocket texas jacks share himself and
texas jack had turned his horse on the
back trail

  the renegades brain was warped
far back in his cowardly soul he hated
loma carlyle bitterly hated her al-
most as much as he did link sander-
son the memory of the ignominious
manner in which link had smashed
him to the ground that first day in
thunder city when he had accosted
loma burned in him like a hot iron
he had sworn vengeance that day and
each passing hour had intensified his
thirst for revenge

  being the innate coward and bully
that he was texas jack had no desire
to run into link sanderson he was
hoping against hope that joe colinga


ranch romances

would succeed where spider glick had
failed and he resolved that loma
carlyle should pay both her own debt
and that of link

  he had not hurried his trip back
he would take his time he decided-
take his time and play the game abso-
lutely safe therefore though he
reached the bar c  just at dawn he
did not immediately go to the build-
ings

  he had heard of the way molly
downs had beaten joe colinga to earth
and he had no desire to run foul of this
stalwart western woman she might
have come down to the ranch to visit
loma again so the renegade had taken
up his position well up in the timber
where he could watch without being
seen he was going to make sure that
loma was absolutely alone before he
made any move

  the sun came up dispelling the mists
of night and warming the spring-
touched slopes smoke curled up from
the chimney of the ranch house per-
haps an hour later loma herself ap-
peared she went to the corrals sad-
dled a bronco and took the trail for
thunder city

  texas jacks first inclination was to
attempt to ride her down but he gave
this up on realizing that she might and
probably would outrun him also she
carried a rifle and he knew that she was
the sort who would use it so he bided
his time his hate feeding his patience

  hunger came upon him and as the
ranch was to all intents deserted he
slipped down cautiously and made his
way to it from the storehouse he se-
cured a supply of food and went back
to his hide-out after eating he
stretched himself in the sun and slept
it was mid-afternoon when he awoke
to resume his scrutiny of the ranch
house just in time to see loma return-
ing from town still alone

  his lips twisted in savage satisfac-
tion his opportunity was at hand
hed give her time to become settled
down then make his advance loma
unsaddled and walked briskly to the

house she disappeared and the place
lay somnolent and quiet

  from his saddle boot the renegade
lifted his rifle hitched up his gunbelt
and stole downward after removing
his spurs in the cause of quietness he
selected a blind corner of the ranch
house for his advance and slipped
across the intervening space vuthout
challenge of any sort here his stealth
and care intensified

  silent as a shadow he glided along
and peered around the next corner to
view the porch a leer of triumph
twisted his repelling unshaven fea-
tures there was an old canvas loung-
ing chair in evidence and in hs was
couched the slim strong figure of the
girl she was asleep her face soft and
glowing in repose turned slightly
towards him she had loosened her hair
and it spread beneath her head in a
blue-black cascade of sheening silk

  texas jacks eyes narrowed his leer
became more pronounced like some
prowling jungle cat he stole towards
her once she stirred and sighed  lit-
tle like a tired child texas jack froze
his lips peeling back but loma soon
quieted and he moved forward crce
more a step in front of her he paused
feasting his eyes on her loveliness
then with a muttered curse his aon
hand flashed forward and fastened on
her shoulder

  loma awoke with a start staring up
at him the color drained from her
face and for a second deep in her eyes
lay naked unashamed terror

  you she gasped

  yeah he leered me i come back
to settle a little debt

  the terror in her eyes vanished and
scathing anger and contempt rerlaced
it take your filthy hand off me she
blazed link told you hed kill you if
you ever bothered me again and he
will

  texas jack laughed wolfishly he
wont be in any condition to kill any-
body after joe colinga gets through
with him

  it was lomas turn to laugh you
heritage of conflict



fool joe colinga made the mistake of
trying to dry-gulch eagle sanderson
the other day evidently you didnt
know about that but if youre waiting
for joe colinga to do anything to link
youll have a long wait

  texas jack knew that loma was
telling him truthful words he hadnt
heard about that particular incident
and he was visibly startled but he
steadied again either way it aint
gonna help yuh any yore goin with
me yuh can take yore choice o cornin
along peaceable or bein tied up
whichll it be

  lomas brain had been racing her
first furious anger at herself for being
thus caught off her guard gave way to
desperate cunning her demeanor
changed she appeared to wilt helpless
with fright

  d-dont tie me she stammered
ill come quietly

  it gratified the brute in texas jack
to see this girl apparently quailing in
terror before him he gloated over the
spectacle loma had seemingly col-
lapsed into tears her hands were over
her face her shoulders heaving con-
vulsively but had the renegade looked
closely enough he would have seen
through her slightly spread fingers
eyes of stormy smoky violet watching
him alertly

  he straightened up removing his
grasp this was easy-too easy he had
thought all along that this girl had
courage that she was a fighter and lie
had relished the thought of taming her
but here she was in a typically femi-
nine paroxysm of tears shaking before
his mere glance

  okeh he snarled i wont tie yuh
up but if yuh dont come quiet or if
yuh try any tricks ill quirt the devil
outa yuh stand up

  she did with an explosive sudden-
ness that texas jack wasnt looking
for and as she gained her feet one
small brown tightly clenched fist
curved up and out with all her hundred
and twenty pounds of outraged dignity
behind it it landed with a very re-

spectable spat on the renegades face
spinning him off balance and before
he could recover himself she had
leaped off the porch and was running
like a deer for the corrals

  cursing and raging texas jack went
after her but she beat him to the first
fence slithered over it just out of his
reach and topped the next one before
he could catch her by the time the
renegade had topped this one she was
among the sheds and feed barn

 then began a game of desperate
hide-and-seek honest fear tipped
lomas heels with wings as she dodged
hither and yon just managing to keep
her lead she knew it could not last
forever sooner or later staunch as she
was this brute would tire her out

  however she determined to fight for
her freedom as long as she possibly
could she wondered if her traitorous
riders had left a weapon of any kind
in the bunkhouse she began working
around to make a dash for it but
texas jack guessing her intent headed
her back

 he was cursing horribly loma
thought of a drooling mad animal her
strength began to go

 link she murmured brokenly

link

  she caught up a short length of wood
and with her back to the wall of a
shed determined to make a final des-
perate stand there was just a chance
that she might get in a lucky blow
with the club held high she faced the
renegade her heart thundering cruelly
her breath coming in gasps

  berserk the renegade charged in
she swung the club with all her might
and texas jack caught the impact on
an upraised warding arm the next
moment he had her his hands tearing
at her like claws

  neither heard the pounding desperate
hoofs of a horse hammering to a halt
not far away loma fought with all her
strength but knew it was a losing
fight the cry that came from her
throat seemed to rise of its own accord
despairing heart-broken


ranch romances

  link link

  right here sweetheart

  the answer reached her ears and she
thought she must be dreaming but it
was no dream the manner in which
texas jack was torn away from her
and thrown headlong nor was there
anything dream-like in the lean dusty
blood-stained figure that faced the
sprawled renegade faced him in a low
deadly crouch

  loma tried to speak her arms out-
stretched but the arms fell empty by
her sides the words did not come for
link was not looking at her his face
pale and pain-twisted beneath the ma-
hogany trn was as bitter and stern and
cold as death his eyes held the
abysmal chill of glacial ice and they
stared with unwinking intentness at
texas jack who was struggling to his
feet his features a mirror of mingled
fear hate and thwarted cunning

  link was speaking and his words
fell in low measured cadence

  the finish yuh poison polecat
throw em im gonna kill yuh any-
how-but throw em

  texas jack didnt want to throw his
guns in an even break he had always
maneuvered for an edge-for a set-up
in his favor but death was looking
him in the eye remorseless certain
he licked his lips staring at links
face lined and gray and haggard he
noted the limp dangling left arm and
the blood-clotted sleeve

  maybe the edge was there after all
maybe this fellow was far gone with
weakness from that wound maybe his
movements would be slowed down just
that split second which meant the dif-
ference of life or death for the first
and last time in his life the renegade
gambled

  his hands blurred down and started
up they only started for there was
red flame dancing before him measured
thunder in his ears and hot vengeful
lead lashing through his body beating
him backward crushing out the life
spark pounding him down    down
   down   

  like an empty useless tossed-aside
sack texas jack slithered to the
ground without having fired a single
shot

  a long minute link sanderson stared
at the lifeless figure before him then
he straightened slowly-a man in-
finitely weary he turned to face the
girl who was coming to him her face
white but her eyes brilliant with death-
less glory

 loma he mumbled loma-
honey

  he tottered and sagged his face fall-
ing still and silent against her as she
caught his crumpling body in her arms

eagle sanderson barked
wrathfully at sleepy burch
doggone it he roared yuh aint
told me how bad links hurt

  sleepy grinned boss yuh oughta
be ashamed of yoreself dyuh think
link is the sort to pass out from a
single slug an him yore own son
shucks that jasper couldnt be killed
with a post maul

  all right growled the old fellow
now that yuhve quit searin me into
fits suppose yuh tell me what hap-
pened roll me a cigarette first

  sleepy rolled the smoke put it be-
tween eagles lips scratched a match
and obediently related his tale

  when the rest of us got to the bar
c s he concluded we finds texas
jack was daid as hell ever be an link
sprawled cut in the shade with miss
carlyle holdin his haid in her arms
cryin over him an kissin him plumb

a strange trail

                         by clinton dangerfield

        courage such as molly wardell possessed comes to but a few brave hearts and surely
        molly should have as mate a man whose valor equalled hers molly thought she had
        made such a choice until she took that strange trail that led to new and untried dangers

dozen of the diamond d geld-
ings half wild from long dis-
use galloped unwillingly toward
the gaping mouth of the home
corral forced on by molly wardell and
her father wardells stern blue eyes
softened as he watched the careless ease
of his daughters riding

 knee grip as good as a mans
thought wardell and no other girl half
as pretty in this whole damn county
molly caught his glance and flashed
an eager happy smile at him nothing
delighted her more than aiding in the
recapture of horses needed for the re-
muda she whirled her mount cutting
off the escape of a plunging gray then
gave a triumphant whoopee as the
bunch streamed into the corral before
her father could leave his saddle she

 sprang down put up the bars then
leaned against them laughing at him

  beat yuh to it dad dont yuh
think im just as good as lin at round-
ing em up

  lin muttered her father suddenly
frowning molly he claims you two
will marry soon as he gets back from
mexico with them cattle that true
she nodded assent her lovely sun-
bronzed face serious now molly lin
derrys temper has showed up plumb
hellish in the past two years ive had
to pay him out of lots of trouble count
of it oh yeah i know hes never
showed you no temper-a man dont in
courtin days

  she seized on a chance to change the
subject look dad yonder comes
a rider toppin that rise




ranch romances

  wardell turned in his saddle his stern
eyes narrowed cornin hell for leather
bad news damn thats curt jones
who ought to be down in mexico with
lin

  they waited breathless then the
man raced up to them his horse slid to
a halt

  curt dusty haggard waited for no
greeting but broke out as he halted
lins in bad trouble mr wardell
them cattle were lousy an lin went
wild over the long ride hed had for
nothin i tried to tame him down
cause he had yore roll and we needed
to keep cool couldnt do nothin with
him he knocked mendoza down an
when the fellow hops up he goes for his
gun course lin beat him to the draw
-kilt him

  molly whitened at the news clutched
at the bars for support

  this here mendoza curt went on
was a cousin of general yznagas the
general and hs men was expected in an
hour ridin through there lin vas
jailed and yore roll o course disap-
peared in the process boss yznaga
come in soonern they expected and i
got private speech with him he said
lin would be shot at sunrise an i said
if hed give me time to get to you yuhd
ransom him

  wardell looked grim at this and said
nothing

  but this here yznaga the cowboy
continued hes a dandy and a great
horseman hes horse-mad like some
folks are money-mad he says to me if
ill bring him ace the golden stallion
hell take the horse in exchange for
lins life an let lin escape secret
yznaga was up here once and seen ace
tried to buy him from kit bridger but
couldnt

  so ridin relays i came to kit
bridgers place an told him what
yznaga said kit says reckon yuh
know lin derry sent me word just
afore he went down into mexico that
he aimed to shoot me on sight when he
got back he picked a quarrel with me
over nothin wardell stepped in be-

  tween us but that only put the matter
off now yore askin me to send the
only thing i care about down into the
hands of those mexicans to be rode to
death cut to pieces with a quirt ace
saved my life twice an ill not do it
and says kit moreover reckon yuh
got sense enough to know curt that if
yznaga did let lin escape from jail
hed see to it he was shot while he was
runnin its a little spanish custom 
and ill bet kit told yuh wardell
interpolated harshly that if yuh went
back down into mexico yuhd never
leave there alive once yuh delivered the
stallion that mendoza had a follow-
ing yznaga wouldnt dare leave anyone
alive who knew hed traded the life of
mendozas killer for a horse

  yeah curt said wearily slipping
from his saddle and supporting him-
self by an arm hooked over the
saddle horn he said that so i bor-
rowed me a fresh horse from kit and
come on fast as i could

  kit bridgers heartless cruel
gasped molly but well get up a res-
cue party well save lin

  her father shook his head yznaga
has that section of mexico under mar-
tial control we couldnt raise three
men for an expedition like that because
it would be suicide for all of us im
sorry for lin molly im sorry for yuh
but    he stopped and turned to
curt come on up to the house time
yuh had food and drink

  curt ate drank fell across the bed
pointed out to him and slept like a log

  meanwhile molly wept and argued
but at last her father made her see
clearly that nothing would induce either
himself or his friends to attempt a res-
cue this was confirmed by two of the
neighboring ranchers who rode in on
business both of them said just as
wardell had done that the- were sorry
for lin but something chill about their
regrets made it plain that the devilish
temper lin had shown in the past two
years had wrecked all the good-will the
neighborhood had once felt toward him
that night at ten oclock wardell
a strange trail



drew his daughter close to him and said
yuh understand now molly that wed
give help if we could but we cant
he brought this on himself yuh dont
want us to go down there merely to die
in the same town with him eh

  she clung to her father no i dont
want that

  then yuh go up to yore room and
try to sleep yore worn out with this
storming and crying

  she nodded exhausted with emotion
he kissed her and she went meekly
away she flung herself dressed as she
was in her riding clothes on the bed
there she lay face upward staring at
the ceiling not sleeping but thinking

that night about two oclock a
slender figure carefully dressed in
mens clothes slipped like a shadow
from the ranch house and in a short
time rode quietly into the starlit night
heading straight for kit bridgers place

  her only precaution against pursuit
was to leave her father a note saying
she had left for omaha to visit a friend
her father might not believe her but it
would take him some time to check up
on her whereabouts meanwhile she
would be well on her way to mexico

  molly found bridgers very quiet
when she arrived kit and his men
vere asleep in the ranch house as he
had no family the main building was
ranch house and bunkhouse in one

  no dog barked only in the distance
an owl hooted dismally dismounting
molly stripped her own horse turned
it into the corral she would use her
own outfit on the mount that she was
after now-the great golden stallion
ace

  he was not loose in the corral he
wouldnt be his temper was too high
to turn him among the geldings she
made straight for the barn the first
stall she came to was occupied by ace
it was a heavy stall built of timber
reinforced the door solid oak and pad-
locked

  she stared at the padlock in dismay
remembering now that curt some days

before had told her bridger had said
two attempts had been made to steal the
stallion but she had never thought of
bridgers keeping him under lock and
key

  she recalled also that curt reported
bridger as saying any thief who gets
ace signs his own death warrant ill
never leave the trail till i find him

  well if she could ever get the pad-
lock open kit bridger might trail all he
liked for the golden stallion was the
fastest animal in the whole countryside
she might trust ace to show a clean
pair of heels to anything which kit
bridger could ride after them

  the padlock soon demonstrated to
her that only the key would serve her
purpose she stood thinking that key
would be somewhere in kits own room
-probably in his clothes she knew
that the only ranch-owner distinction
bridger affected was that of occupying
a bedroom of his own she had ques-
tioned curt artfully about kit bridger
and all his habits she herself knew
nothing of him except the brief glimpse
she had had once while both of them
were in town

  so with a desperate courage which
refused to think of danger she went
straight to the house

  people of this countryside didnt bolt
their doors and molly found the front
door unlocked as she had expected
once inside she again drew upon the
information she had cunningly extracted
from the unsuspecting curt bridgers
room lay to the left at the front on the
other side of the narrow hall further
back his men testified to their sound
slumber by loud snores

  but kit bridgers room was silent
she stole to his door it was closed but
not locked she soon found as her cau-
tious fingers slowly turned the knob
now as she opened the door a little
way her heart jumped at the sound of
the rusty hinges creaking

  but bridger sound asleep on the bed
did not wake through the curtainless
wide-open windows the newly risen
moon round and bright poured a flood


ranch romances

of brilliance thankful for its aid molly
hurried softly to the chaps and trousers
flung carelessly across a chair

  the key was not there

  again she stood thinking and unwill-
ingly enough realized that the key was
probably under kit bridgers pillow

  she had left her boots hanging to the
horn of her saddle and her moccasin-
clad feet were light as falling feathers
as she crept toward kit bridgers bed-
side

  he lay on his back one hand flung
out across the sheet which covered him
even in sleep his handsome bronzed
face looked stern the mouth resolutely
closed between the fine arch of his
brows a slight frown which had be-
come habitual added its touch of warn-
ing not to meddle with a man whom
many feared

  his gun was not in his holster and
molly realized with deepening fright
that if the key were under his pillow
no doubt the gun was also she was in
mens clothes if she waked him getting
at the key what if he jerked out the
gun and shot her before he realized she
was only a girl

  angrily she told herself she hadnt
come there to entertain such thoughts
she had shouldered a mans job and
like a man she must get through with
it ignoring whatever terrors lay in the
path above all she needed coolness
now and steadiness

  close to the bedside she stared down
anxiously at kit bridgers face and sud-
denly found herself held by it she
shook off the deepening fascination
was she mad to be standing there star-
ing at a man who if he waked might
kill her

  crouching beside him she thrust
small exploring fingers under his pillow
keeping the pressure of her fingers al-
ways down against the mattress hop-
ing in this way not to disturb him she
would have had little chance of contin-
uing this had not bridger been without
sleep for the last forty-eight hours
seeking the doctor for an injured man
wrestling with a stampede and other

unexpected troubles had resulted in to-
nights deep sleep although usually the
slightest sound the faintest vibration
would waken him

  molly pushed her hand on further
sometimes moving it to the right some-
times to the left then suddenly just as
she had given up hope her small fingers
touched the key and still the sleep-
lost man did not feel her presence in the
room

  yet he dreamed of molly wardell-a
troublesome dream which made him stir
in his sleep he nearly froze molly with
terror by rolling over on his left side
and bringing his face directly opposite
hers his weight holding her hand now
still under the feathers

  he must be waking she squatted
back on her heels frozen with fright
then as he lay quite still she slowly
and cautiously withdrew the key

  silence deepened in the room kit
bridger ceased to dream at all and sank
once more into deep sleep he did not
waken till his usual hour just before
dawn then as with all healthy people
body and mind snapped into instant
alertness he flung the covers aside
walked to the window stretched then
instinctively glanced toward the barn

  a curse leaped from his lips the
door of aces stall was wide open

at furious speed kit bridger woke
his men allotted to them their
ranch tasks hurriedly got together the
few things he wanted for the trail and
roped the horse next best to the golden
stallion then deaf to the warnings of
his men not to follow the trail over the
rio grande because of the turbulent
condition of mexico bridger took up
his quest of vengeance and of recapture

  to regain ace he would follow that
trail through the whole length of mex-
ico he swore to himself cursing curt
jones in one breath and in another cer-
tain horse rustlers whom he half sus-
pected to be the guilty parties

  he had one advantage which molly
wardell did not think of-there had
been a hard rain the day before which
a strange trail



made trailing easy and kit bridger
had another advantage which he himself
did not suspect the thief riding the
golden stallion knew nothing of the
route curt had ridden it was for this
reason that molly riding out of her way
and then into the right direction again
handicapped her flight to such an extent
that on the second day of her desperate
ride she looked up from the floor of a
gorge and to her terror saw a pursuing
horseman riding down the trail above
her

  she should have broken into instant
flight as it was she believed that the
man above had not seen her where-
upon she cut across the floor of the
gorge to hide in a ravine which ran
deep into the west side of the gloomy
place

  kit bridger not daring to hope that
the thief was really riding for the cut
snatched his rifle from the boot raised
it to his shoulder and took steady
aim at the fleeing figure the man on
that horse was just about curt jones
size small and slender yes it was
curt and to hell with him because he
valued a snarling quarreler like lin
derry was that any reason why kit
bridger should lose the one thing which
still made life bright for him-the mag-
nificent stallion curt rode

  kit knew he could not miss the shot
was well within his rifle range he had
killed mountain sheep at a much greater
distance under much greater difficulties
his trigger-finger hugged closer closer
-pulled the trigger

  only a snap answered him in haste
he examined the rifle and found that
when the key had been stolen from un-
der his pillow the thief had paused on
the way out to ruin the mechanism of
the weapon no doubt he had carried it
out into the hall for that purpose where
the faint sounds he made could not be
heard

  kit bridger jammed the rifle back
into its boot then almost uttered a yell
of triumph for he saw the thief turn
into the cut the fool thought he was
hiding there well let him think so

  bridger tfode down into the gorge at
furious speed then galloped hard along
the floor but kept straight ahead as
though he were going to pass the arroyo
east of the mouth even yet if the thief
darted out at the top speed of the
golden stallion he might escape should
bridger happen to miss him with his
short gun

  as the rancher drew even with the
mouth of the ravine he saw no signs of
the horse-thief issuing forth so he
whirled his mount crossed the gorge
floor in a flash and was in the ravine
gun in hand

  the mouth was almost choked by a
huge boulder bridger rounded this
with reckless indifference then checked
his mount to a sliding halt for beyond
him at the head of the cut in plain
sight stood ace-broadside to his mas-
ter because the thief hearing the clatter
of hoofs had instantly used him for a
shield

  kit bridger flung himself from the
saddle advanced a few steps and halted
he called out scornfully come out
from behind that horse yuh dirty cow-
ard step aside to the right a couple of
yards ill promise yuh an even break

  but the thief didnt come out

  bridger snapped yuh damn fool
dont yuh know yore legs are showin
i can shoot the feet off yuh any min-
ute

  still not a sound nor any movement
from the feet kit bridger whistled at
the sharp imperious sound a signal he
had been sternly trained to obey ace
plunged against the reins angered by
their restraint he reared pivoted flung
his whole weight against the leathers
jerking away from the horse-thief he
rushed to his master mane and tail
floating triumphantly eyes gleaming

  to the astonishment of bridger curt
jones instead of going for his gun had
crumpled on the ground gauntleted
hands over his face and sobs appar-
ently shaking his shoulders

  for a second kit bridger looked in
amazed contempt at the desolate figure
then he realized this couldnt be curt


ranch romances

jones-probably some mexican boy who
had been hired to rustle the stallion
he called out impatiently get up yuh
young coyote and come here im not
goin to hurt yuh now ive got the
horse

  the figure rose came warily toward
him his amazement deepened as he
saw the pale tear-wet face of molly
wardell

  kit bridger jammed his gun back into
its holster and strode toward her the
two stood looking into each others eyes

 for petes sake he demanded
roughly whats the answer to all
this

  lins death she answered strug-
gling against the sobs in her throat
now yuhve got the horse hell have
to die

  wheres the rest of yore gang his
voice was harsh angry

  there never was anyone but me no
one else cared enough to take any
risks

 yuh mean he asked his eyes
widening in sheer amazement that yuh
were going alone with my horse to
swap him-or fancying yuh could swap
him-for lin derry

  she nodded assent its all spoiled
now she muttered

 she swayed he fancied she was
about to fall sprang forward and swept
her into his arms with a rush of pitying
tenderness yuh brave little fool

  the unexpected sympathy of his tone
the gentleness and strength combined
in his clasp suddenly weakened her gal-
lant courage against her enemys
shoulder she rested quietly too worn
from the tense anxiety and fatigue of
the past few days to marvel at her own
reaction

  her hat held by its thong had fallen
back on her shoulder kit bridger
looked down on the ruffled glory of her
hair her face was hidden now against
his shoulder poor kid she loved this
lin he thought as he himself had once
idealized and loved a woman only to
find that love mocked and betrayed

  molly he said gently well camp

here a bit we both need some food
and heres a spring handy lets try not
to think of anythin right now but restin
the horses and gettin a little grub our-
selves

  she raised her head nodded bravely
accepting with forced composure the
task of helping him prepare the meal
she noted with a bitter little sigh that
he had taken no chances on her grab-
bing the stallion after all both horses
were hobbled and left to graze clean
outside the mouth of the ravine where
they could find sweet grasses along the
meanderings of the springs stream

  she felt revived and strengthened as
the meal progressed not only by the
food and drink but by some subtle stim-
ulus she felt from his presence kit
bridger himself vas strangely dis-
turbed the charm and challenge of
this girl her amazing courage her love-
liness stirred new depths in his being

  he had hated lin derry before in an
impatient casual way but now his hate
of derry was hot that she should be
willing to risk her life-and more than
her life-for that savage-tempered blun-
dering fool he said a trifle hoarsely
did yuh fancy that if yuh delivered
the stallion to yznaga you yoreself
would be allowed to return home a
girl as  as beautiful as you

  i didnt intend that the mexicans
should ever know im a girl she said
naively cant yuh see how carefully
im dressed to look like a man

  yuh wouldnt fool any man with
eyes in his head molly yore femi-
nine from the top of yore head to the
sole of yore feet it sings in that sweet
voice of yores and when yuh move-no
man could be so graceful

  you talk like that who hate me

  i dont hate yuh i wish i did in
that case i wouldnt mind yuh calling
me what yuhve called yore father and
all the men yuh counted as friends of
yores-cowards yuhve no right to
think them cowards because they didnt
want to commit suicide as you tried to
do he rose commanding curtly help
me get up the horses its time to be
a strange trail



moving quite a ways from here to
yore fathers house

  tears sprang again to her eyes they
were going home ignominiously and
lin down there in mexico she moved
a little blindly towards the horses he
strode beside her apparently not notic-
ing her tears

  when they were both mounted she
on the black he on the gleaming splen-
dor of the golden stallion he said
curtly

  beat it home as fast as yuh can tell
yore dad ive gone down into mexico
ill see what i can do for lin ill take
the one chance there is of saving him-
not through that precious yznaga but
through a little idea of my own

  she was now as amazed as he had
been when she first stood revealed to
him in the arroyo then she said in
steady quiet tones do yuh think id
let yuh go down there alone

  yuhll do just what i tell yuh he
countered savagely get going beat
it

  for a moment she stared full into his
eyes then slowly she turned the black
and rode north

  he himself struck south and tried to
keep from glancing in her direction
again he did not turn his head for half
a mile until he was out of the gorge
and riding along a plain then looking
back he saw molly on the black horse
calmly following him

  he drove her back she obeyed him
with the same meekness she had shown
before but no sooner had he put some
distance between them than looking
back he again discovered her following
when he had driven her back in vain
for the third time he rode to meet her
and looked at her with mingled respect
admiration and exasperation

  its no use she said smiling im
going along-lets say as a boy yuhve
hired she added hurriedly as she saw
the frown between his eyes darkening
ominously ill mind every word yuh
say if yuh tell me to hide in the
bushes ill hide and yuh fight all the
mexicans yuh want alone

  he couldnt help grinning yore
not all there he said

  a lunatic with yuh is better than
nothing and if yuh keep on turning
me back yuhll only waste a lot of
time

  he groaned then suddenly said sav-
agely if yuh dont turn back as im
tellin yuh if yuh dont go straight to
yore father ill ride home myself lack-
ing ace yuh couldnt do anythin
oh yes i could she said steadily
i can go and beg for lins life and
i thats all i can do ill do that

 god knows you are crazy but
come on only if yuh disobey a single
order of mine-

  i give yuh leave to beat me she
said almost gaily

mile after mile slipped beneath the
feet of their horses as they moved
steadily south night fell night passed

  day after day night after night
slipped by like black beads on a chain
of terror or so they should have been
yet somehow strangely enough they
went only too fast for these two who
thought they would never again be to-
gether

  they had good luck on the weather
and good luck in being able to buy grain
now and then at some isolated hamlet
some time ago they had left the rio
behind them and now were pushing
down into that ancient dangerous
country which never knows real peace
kits fluent mexican spanish was a
great help to them but the beauty of
the stallion and his striking color were
always a danger yet for one thing kit
was thankful the magnificence of his
horse drew the eyes of the greedy on-
lookers away from the seeming youth
who rode beside him and she continued
to pass for a boy

  it seemed to bridger now that he had
known her always and he said to him-
self with sudden bitterness had loved
her always but that love would per-
haps not torment him long he had a
hunch he would be killed down there in
releasing lin derry and grimly he

said to himself maybe it was better so
for he realized with every passing hour
that he who seemed to be master on
this journey was in reality body and
soul captive to molly wardell

  at last just as night was closing in
there appeared before them the lights of
the mexican town they sought it lay
in a small valley around which swept
frowning cliffs the place was open to
access in only two directions this in-
cluded the trail they were following
now

  they halted above the town looking
down upon it here they would remain
kit bridger explained until two oclock
and he elaborated fully the plan he had
in mind falling back among the thick
trees they made themselves as comfor-
table as they could gave the horses what
little grain remained at the cantles and
settled down to waiting

  bridger now told her that he knew
this section well he himself had been
down here buying cattle before this re-
cent revolution had broken out

  hour after hour passed through a
little vista in the trees molly saw the
lights of the town go out one after the
other and suddenly it seemed to her
that those lights had been stars of hope
-hope that was now cruelly vanishing

  she had pitted kit bridger not only
against the people of the town-the
jailer the sentinel sure to be outside-
she had also pitted him against yznaga
and all his men wrapped in her terror
and pity for lin she had thought of
nothing else but now she did think
most fully of kit bridgers side of the
game and it suddenly came upon her
like a chill wave how right her father
had been

  she and kit were sitting on the
ground beside each other leaning
against a ledge of rock one small hand
flew out in the starlit darkness and
caught bridgers hand in a quick con-
vulsive clasp her sweet voice hoarse
with anxiety murmured brokenly star-
tling him by its emotion im sending
yuh to yore death its all useless and
terrible lin brought this on himself

i see now how right dad was theres
no use in yore dying too  lets turn

back

  bridger knew instinctively that she
was not thinking of herself in all the
misery and distress she had suffered
during the past days her frantic anxiety
had been always for someone else
bridgers arm went round her crush-
ing her close to his side his own voice
was hoarse with feeling molly i
never dreamed of a girl like you but
quit worrying believe that ill put it
through and if i dont 

  and if yuh dont she shivered

      then remember yore promise
to me he said yuhll cut out for
home as fast as ever ace can carry yuh

nother hour

  and now the sentinel at the jail
sullenly wondered why the relief on his
beat was late was juan drinking
again had he forgotten he was due
here now if only this gringo dog
there in the jail had been shot at once
as he should have been the jail would
have been empty and no sentinel work
would have to be done

  his reflections were broken by the
clear call of a quail which came from a
fringe of bushes near the broken-down
wall of the jail yard something must
have disturbed the bird to make it call
at night thought the sentinel if only it
would come into the open and he could
see its small body moving along he
might be able to kill it with a rock he
was very fond of quail he wouldnt
dare to fire at it for that would alarm
the town

  he moved a little nearer to the fringe
of bushes his whole mind bent upon get-
ting the quail vhich had come so op-
portunely to break the maddening mo-
notony of his beat the quail whistled
boldly it was coming nearer still

  softly he laid down his rifle and
reached for a small stone then as he
flattened out on the ground like a dead
bat astride of him dropped kit bridger
warning him in spanish not to utter a
sound
a strange trail



  now listen whispered kit close to
the fellows ear yuhll rise yuhll
go to the jail door knock loudly and
say theres a messenger out here from
general yznaga to see the jailer obey
an yuh wont be hurt fail in the
slightest degree dog and yuh die
senor senor whispered the senti-
nel quite distinctly i have no desire
to die i will obey every word that the
senor commands

  disturbed by the loud pounding on
the jail door the jailer arose sullenly
and demanded through it who is
there what do you desire

  glibly enough the sentinel explained
just as he had been told to do the
jailer shrugged no doubt yznaga was
about to execute the gringo privately
and a good thing if he did thought
the jailer he opened the door and ad-
mitted both the sentinel and the man
whom he supposed to be the messenger

  beyond them in the furthest cell of
the jail lin derry heard that knocking
and interpreted it just as the jailer had
done he was about to die yznaga
was weary of keeping him he had
broken his pledge to give curt jones
time to return with the stallion but no
there had been time and there had been
no stallion

  at last in humiliation and despair
lin derry had begun to realize how lit-
tle he had taught men to value him
how unlikely it was not only that kit
bridger would be willing to part with
his horse but also how most unlikely
that any mass rescue would be at-
tempted-especially in the present state
of ferment in mexico if he had only
kept his head about those lousy cattle
but then when in the past few years
had he ever kept his head

  well he was about to die and he
would die bravely

  he heard the tramp of approaching
feet folded his arms threw back his
head and standing beside his window
bravely faced the opening door his pale
blue eyes quite steady his full passion-
ate lips firm in this hour derry wore
a real dignity

  but it vanished as he stepped forward
to meet not yznagas soldiers but the
amazing presence of kit bridger-his
enemy he knew instantly that bridger
had not come here to do him any harm
that was not necessary bridger would
only have needed to leave that to the
scant time remaining before derry faced
execution

  the jailer and the sentinel are in the
jailers office knocked out and gagged
explained bridger curtly heres a
belt and gun for yuh follow me close
ive got horses    damn it dont
waste time thankin me be quiet

  he hurried derry on before him out
of the jail door locked it and thrust the
keys into his own belt in the shadow
of the bushes fringing the trail the
amazed derry saw not two horses but
three the central one was ace the
golden stallion with molly riding him
on each side of her was a led horse
these were fresh animals which kit
bridger had picked out of yznagas own
remuda grazing in a paddock nearby re-
flecting ironically to himself that both
he and molly were horse-thieves now

  lin derry broke out into exclama-
tions at sight of molly again kit
bridger savagely cut him off they
mounted hurriedly and were about to
turn north when bridger halted them

  listen

  a detail of mounted men probably
yznagas was coming southward along
the trail they should be on at bridgers
order each rider leaned forward put-
ting a swift hand over the nostrils of
his horse then suddenly the horse lin
derry rode reared in fright

  a man broke out from the thick scrub
near him rushed toward the jail yelling
and firing his gun as he went it was
the relief the missing juan who should
have been there half an hour ago but
who as pedro had surmised had
stopped for an extra drink yet he was
not too drunk to realize that the gringo
prisoner was escaping

  they could no longer ride north
they must escape through the south
exit bridger knew at his word of

command the horses sprang forward
and they raced past the demoralized
sentinel vho was battering vainly on the
jail door on into the sleeping town
they went where lights already were
beginning to spring up dogs were
barking wildly clamor and confusion
coming to light everywhere

  the maudlin condition of the relief
sentinel had saved them from any bul-
lets from his gun but now as they
thundered through the town more than
one rifle snarled more than one bullet
sung past them the detail of soldiers
would of course gallop to the jail first
and would undoubtedly have sense
enough to realize that the three on
horseback would make for the south
exit since they had been cut off from
the north

  molly felt thankful when they were
past the clamor of the village somehow
she didnt mind the bullets as much as
she minded the wild barking of the dogs
there was something sinister in their
chorus as though they presaged certain
death

  at the furious pace they were keep-
ing it did not take them long to arrive
at the second exit prehistoric forces
had torn a gaping rent in the mountain
if that rent had been deeper a river
would have flowed into the valley
would have made a lake where the town
lay now but the rent was not deep
enough and the river outside the pass
shouldered close by it cutting off all
exit except for the bridge ramshackle
and so narrow horses must pass over
it in defile

  the walls of the river pitched sheer
down on the town side opposite fifty
yards beyond the bridge was a place
where a horse might scramble out

  they thundered across but on the
other bank kit bridger paused molly
and lin derry watched him with anx-
ious curiosity

  hell snarled lin derry what
yuh hangin round here for yznagas
men will be on that bridge in a few
minutes its bad enough for yuh to
have dragged a girl like molly into this

without riskin her life any more than
yuh can help

  lin cried molly angrily let me
tell yuh-

  but kit bridger cut them both off
short leave him alone molly what
difference does it make what he thinks
i want yore riatas-or wait i want
yore horse this one im ridin has
speed plenty of it but ill need my
stallions strength for what im goin
to do

  give me the riata on yore saddle
derry-and the one from yores molly
he added for they had now exchanged
horses that gives me three i think
i can swing what im after now
molly yuh promised to obey orders
beat it you and lin

  oh kit vailed the girl id
rather-

 damn yuh almost snarled kit
bridger will yuh go

  she turned and galloped away the
rhythm of her horses feet mingling
with her sobbing galloping alongside
of her lin derry gazed at her his hate
of kit bridger deepening with every
moment that bridger had saved him
only made things much worse he
would not dare to quarrel again with
kit bridger

  lin derry felt no hell could be worse
than posing as grateful to the man he
wanted to kill and yet such a pose
he would be forced to keep

  they were topping a small rise now
dicobedient molly halted and looked
back her face went white she gasped
lin look hes gone back over the
bridge oh god lin whats he do-
ing

  unwillingly enough lin derry halted
beside her they both wheeled their
horses and sat looking toward the river

  i know what hes doin growled
lin the supports on the town side of
that bridge are rotten ace is as strong
as two ordinary horses this fellow
bridger is aimin to drag the main sup-
port out from under the bridge and
wreck it

  he mustnt he shant stop there
a strange trail



almost screamed molly im going
over there and make him come with
us

  lin derrys hand shot out and caught
her rein stay where yuh are he
snarled see-i told yuh hes made
a dutch collar out of the third riata to
strengthen the horses chances

  let go my rein shrieked molly
or ill cut it

  with a curse lin derry let loose of
it and like a whirlwind she galloped
back toward the bridge with lin at her
side as they reached it the gleaming
magnificent body of the stallion was
straining forward in a lunging powerful
pull kit bridger beside him urging
him on with his voice and a slight touch
of his quirt

  kit screamed the girl for gods
sake kit

  he did not hear her heart and soul
he was bent on his task for which he
had little time if it were to be accom-
plished the soldiers of yznaga were
already firing at the rear yelling as they
came

  but now an encouraging cracking
sound came from the rotten main sup-
port of the bridge on that side for
years it had been in bad condition for
years the town had known it should be
mended but always it was to be done
mahana and now thanks to that dila-
tory attitude the rotten wood suddenly
gave way the town side of the bridge
crashed into the water

  but bullets were whistling like hail
around the destroyer of the towns
causeway kit had no time to loosen
the bridge riaia he cut it with the
flash of his knife then whirled the stal-
lion toward the unfordable sheer bank
driving in his spurs molly hid her eyes
as man and horse arched into the air

  below kit bridger lay a pool how
deep it was he did not know if it were
too shallow both he and the stallion
would die if it were deep enough   

  the failing horse hit the center of the
water with a tremendous splash flying
spray seemed to hide them both al-
though in reality it was the water which

hid them the pool was very deep and
man and horse went completely under

  they rose and on the shelving side
of the pool nearest molly passed into
shallow water and made for the break
on the bank where they might scramble
out toward that break molly galloped
wildly for rifle fire was pouring around
kit bridger and she saw no chance for
him whatever in that moment she felt
that she would share death with him
gladly

  yet he came out unscathed and in
five minutes the yelling cursing mob of
soldiery in the rear could be heard no
longer

  weve got a fighting chance now
kit bridger announced by the time
they get back to the north exit and cut
around to where we are well have had
a start of miles the river isnt fordable
again until yuhve gone a long way

  yore sure yore not shot any-
where yore not hit at all persisted
molly anxiously it seems impossible
that yuh werent-

  im not hurt reiterated kit bridger
then sharply but somebody else is
look

  he wheeled his horse around her as
she was riding between them and
caught lin derry just as he was slip-
ping from the saddle

  dismounting he laid derry at length
on the sod tore open his shirt and with
a start of surprise wondered that he had
kept the saddle as far as he had gone
there was a gaping wound in his chest
he must have been caught by the gun-
fire as they were leaving the town

lin derry looked up im goin
molly they got me    kiss   

 she bent above him her lips
touched his just as his last sigh came

  ahead of them lay a long and cruel
trail they could not stop to bury lin
nor could they carry him for days and
nights ahead kit bridger said gently
that on the trail he would pay the mexi-
cans at some hamlet to go back and do
for them and for lin what they could
not do now

there followed long days long nights

of desperate riding of twisting and
turning and then like a miracle the
rio grande appeared

 back on american soil the tension
lifted

  as they rode along molly said slowly
kit i know now that the love i had
for poor lin was the kind a sister gives
to her brother not the kind i feel
for    she broke off flushing

  he pressed his horse close to hers
his arm went round her shoulder draw-
ing her toward him not the kind that
yuhll give kit bridger whos goin to
be yore husband he announced firmly

  she sighed happily

  he added with a grin but thinkin
of all the times yuhve disobeyed me
molly i reckon yore goin to make a

  but as luck would have it we come
joggin past the district schoolhouse
just then and lessn a second after
jerry spoke two piercin screams split
the ozone we wheeled our hosses
round and before we was out of our
saddles nine younguns come shriekin
from the schoolhouse follered by the
teacher -

  whats up yelled jerry runnin
tords em with me right at his heels

  a snake cried the teacher wide-
eyed and tremblin with terror a
huge rattler-coiled up behind the
stove she swayed and vouldve fell
in a heap if jerry hadnt gripped her
arms she was all aquiver so jerry just
lifted her in his arms and carried her to
a bench under a big pine tree in the
school yard

  just set quiet and calm yourself he
said puttin her on the bench and fan-
nin her with his hat

  ill tend to mister snake says i
rushin into the schoolhouse shore
nuff there was a reptile coiled up be-
hind the stove but twasnt no rattler
so i picked it up and went to the door
and yelled

  your visitor aint no rattlesnake

miss just a bullsnake-plumb harm-
less

  i hated to kill the pore thing but i
knowed that pretty schoclmaam would
worry herself sick wonderin if it might
come back again so i took i up into a
little gully behind the schoolhouse and
done away with it the little ovs fol-
lered and watched me bury it when i
come back to the tree jerry was  ettin
on the bench beside the little lady
gazin with admirin eyes at the glossy
sheen of her dark wavy hair

  hope youre feelin better now
miss he said you neednt have been
scared though them reptiles is meek
and gentle-they keep the rattlers
away

  anyhow that one wont never bother
you no more i chimed in

  so he went and hauled out his guitar
and sang and played for us but he
didnt put his heart into it his thoughts
was all wanderin over pardo way and
instead of givin us merry upliftin dit-
ties he drummed and droned out mel-
ancholy strains such as in the gloamiri

  now i was plumb eager to boost
along this buddin romance cause the
one thing in life i admire equal with
buckarooin is bein top-hand and round-
up boss for dan cupid so i made up
my mind to sort of scout ahead and
pave the way for this pair there was a
rambunctious steer on the spread plumb
ornery and worthless cept for rodeo-
showin purposes which was the only
reason why old man arrondale kept him
around he was kept in a pasture lot
close by the corrals and every now and
again hed ram through the fence and
go rangin so i ambled over to the
pasture lot that night before retirin
busted the fence chased the critter out
and run him a ways in the direction of
pardo

  next mornin i says to old man ar-
rondale old pandemoniums broke
loose again i dont aim to take none of

glad to see me

learys refreshment parlor before goin
to the post office to git me a lemon
sody whilst i was guzzlin it a feller
come in and bought a pack of cigarettes
he was a total stranger to mike and
me-a middle-aged mean-lookin party
with slicked black hair and dressed like
a big town dude also he was likkered
up tightern a tick

 wheresh the post office he
growled swayin back and forth

  down the street a coupla blocks

out so much as a thank you

  okeh stranger says i shovin the

parts anyhow

  i went and got the mail after chinnin
with mike a few minutes then lit out
for home i looked careful for pande-
monium but he wasnt nowheres
around

  that night right after supper jerry
and me took a walk and i give him the
piece of cake miss woodstock sent to
him which it was kind of mashed up
account of me havin to carry it in the
breast pocket of my shirt and also i
give him the gals message

ranch romances

elko and buy me the best durned guitar
i kin find

  so we went to the bunkhouse and he
got out his insterment and showed me
how to hold it then he told me the
names of the strings and showed me
how to press the two outside strings
down on the third fret with my left hand
and pluck with my right

  that theres the first position of the
g chord he said you practise on it
awhile pluck gentle-dont pull the
strings out by the roots

  twasnt near as easy to do as it
looked but it shore was fun it got me
so excited i was all lathered up with
perspiration i yanked my handkerchief
out of my hip pocket to mop my brow
somethin else popped out and fell onto
the floor like a flash i remembered
about the letter that dude stranger gave
me to mail-and id forgot to do same
i picked it up looked at it-and almost
fell off my bunk when i seen the name
on the envelope it was addressed to
miss woodstock

 what in thunder does it mean
asked jerry when i told him how i
come by it

  it means youve gotta deliver this
letter to the little lady when you see
her tomorrow says i in regards to
the sneaky party which give it to me
im bettin hosses to hotcakes she ant
nowise to blame for havin to git it but
it aint none of our business-and it
aint nothin for you to git all wrought
up over neither i picked up the guitar
and started practisin that first position
of the g chord again

  that was just as far as i ever got
learnin to play the guitar jerry just
set gloomin over that danged letter too
upset to pay any more attention to me
that night and things that transpired
from then on kept him from ever givin
me any more lessons

  next mornin jerry went over to the
pardo schoolhouse i told his dad id
sent him out lookin for old pandemo-
nium which i wasnt lyin outright
cause id asked the boy to keep his eye
peeled for the steer when he got back

long about mid-afternoon i jumped my
hoss and we rode away from the other
hands sos he could say what he craved
to tell me

  gosh amighty pete he yelped
that ornery homhre is pesterin miss
woodstock some way she was terri-
ble upset when she read that there let-
ter she got pale as a ghost and she
was tremblin when she finished readin

help she could count on me to stand by
her through thick and thin

  what did she say to that says i
she said i was sweet he muttered
colorin up and she patted my hand
and shes gonna pull off that there pro-
gram tomorrow afternoonstead of fri-
day im bettin it was on account of the
danged letter that she changed the date

when he couldnt think of no good rea-
son for doin same

at one-thirty oclock thursday
afternoon the lad and me was set-
tin side by side on the platform in the
pardo schoolhouse all ready for the
show jerry looked terrible solemn with
his arms folded acrost his chest and his
face flamin red miss woodstock was
dressed up pretty and she shore was a
picture standin at her desk whilst the
little folks filed in and took their places
but she was pale and nervous and
showed plain enough that she was al-
mighty worried bout somethin she
rapped on her desk and said
the girl and the guitar



  children we are very pleased of
course to have guests with us today
who have come to hear our program
im sure you all remember mr carberry
and mr arrondale who so kindly
helped us the other morning with the
snake when she said them words me
and jerry rose up and bowed and
whilst we was bowin an ornery little
red-headed kid in the back of the room
whispered loud enough for everybuddy
to hear

  teachers got a feller

  the room rang with uproarous mirth
me and jerry set and miss ruth rapped
for order again we will start the pro-
gram at once she said speakin so
sharp that the laughin stopped as sud-
den as it started we will stand and
sing our opening song

  so the kids stood up and sang amer-
ica right lusty which jerry and me
joined in and the pretty school teacher
looked pleased

  waal-after the patriotic salute a boy
bout fourteen come forard and spoke
a very excitin piece called the charge
of the light brigade he was a ganglin
youth but talented he waved his arms
and shouted and made a big to-do tellin
bout six hundred soldiers that got
wiped out in death valleywhich itwas
all news to me and got me quite some
wrought up then two or three others
sang songs and spoke pieces an miss
woodstock said

  now children i have a very grand
surprise for you mr arrondale is go-
ing to entertain us with some music
he will play his guitar and sing for us
it was very kind of mr arrondale to
take part in our program and im sure
we will show our appreciation by keep-
ing perfectly still she give jerry a
sweet smile he was all a-tremble with
flusteration but he done himself proud
playin the spanish fandango

  the young uns clapped and cheered
and miss woodstock give the lad such
a sweet yearnin look he almost bust
into tears so then he played and sang
the spanish cavalier very sad and
tender gazin straight at the little lady

all the while but when he was right
in the middle of the glide waltzthere
come a loud knock on the door

  jerry stopped miss ruths face went
white excuse me mr arrondale
she murmured i believe we have an-
other visitor she was all a-tremble
as she passed in front of us to open the
door but before she reached it the
door swung open and a big feller scowl-
in grim as thunder come stridin in it
was the dude stranger id met up with
down to elko

  he was one of the meanest lookin
hombres ever i see without so much
as a glance at jerry and me he follered
the frightened little lady to her desk
get my letter he snarled glarin at
the pore gal with a cold glint in his
beady black eyes

  yes gasped miss woodstock
plumb terror-struck

  then you was expectin me tomor-
row he made a gruntin sound half
laughin half sneerin well i figured
you might try runnin out on me so i
came today he laughed again taunt-
in-like youre goin back to denver
with me-see we get out of elko to-
night i got a rig outside- he jerked
his thumb tords the door

  miss ruth turned to the children
we will not be able to finish our pro-
gram she said i am very sorry
school is dismissed-now please go-
all of you-at once

  the kids got up and straggled out
the tough party turned to me and jerry
for the first time and snarled you can
go too get out

  mr bardonni- cried the little
teacher

  but jerry spoke up before she could
finish were takin orders from the
lady he said cool and calm but his
eyes was flashin danger

friends of mine cried miss ruth id
advise you to address them civilly
furthermore im not going to denver

  the tough hombre walked over to us


ranch romances

and stood within two feet of jerry
sneerin insolent we was on the plat-
form bout a foot higher than him
who are you mugs he growls i was
feelin mighty uneasy cause i knowed
good and well this gent was a gun thug
and jerry and me wasnt armed because
buckaroos just natcherly dont lug
shootin-irons with em to a school en-
tertainment

  were a coupla fellers that kills
snakes around here said jerry im
death on snakes mister

 the dude shoved his hand into his
side coat pocket quick as lightnin
jerrys left foot shot forard and the
hard high heel of his boot struck that
pocket with crushin force the dude
let out a yell of pain with a terrific
swing jerrys right fist crashed in the
dudes face and sent him sprawlin miss
ruth screamed

  then jerry was on top of the sprawlin
bully with one knee on his chest he
gripped the bullys right hand and
twisted the gun from his clutch he
tossed the gun onto the desk shoutin
here ruth-a souvenir for you then
he jerked the bully up onto his feet and
smashed him again knockin him clean
over a row of desks the bully just laid
limp-he was plumb out

 and there was me standin by the
desk watchin the battle plumb dazed
and huggin jerrys guitar to my buz-
zom then i heard a moan and miss
ruth collapsed on the desk in a dead
faint

  jerry rushed over and gathered the
little lady in his arms so i set the
guitar down and took charge of the
tough customer sprawled on the floor
take that bad hombre and do anything
you crave to do with him said jerry

  i took mr bardonni out and tied him
onto my hoss with my lariat there
was a team and buckboard hitched at
the school fence-the rig this hombre
mentioned to miss ruth but whilst
i was ropin up mr bardonni i heard
a hullabaloo of bellerin and snortin
and there come old pandemonium the
crazy steer down the road he charged

straight tords the team and buckboard
like a demon out of perdition the team
busted loose and went streakin down
the road tords elko so i jumped jerrys
bronc and took after pandemonium i
roped the crazy critter with jerrys lariat
and tied him up to a tree then i got
my hoss with the tough dude tied onto
him and lit out for elko

  when we got to town i says lis-
ten stranger youre goin back to den-
ver tonight only youre goin alone
then i took my rope off him and let
him go the last i seen of him he was
hot-footin it tords the depot

  when i got back to the pardo school-
house there was jerry settin on the
teachers desk claspin miss woodstock
to his breast her arms was twined
round his neck and they was kissin and
cooin

  waal-after jerry seen his future wife
home i and him brung old pandemo-
nium back to the arrondale ranch it
was plenty late on the way jerry ex-
plained to me that the bardonni party
was a denver pawnbroker and also a
bootlegger and gambler the little lady
pawned her pianna with him to git
money to help her kid brother through
college then he forced his intentions
on her and was tryin to make her marry

just what are the qualifications for a sheriffs wife should a girl be strong and sturdy
or will a dainty little creature do-if shes the right sort and the sheriff likes her

own the steep narrow moun-
tain trail came a tiny figure
on a tall bay mare-the horse
stepping along with the dain-
tily arched steps of a thoroughbred-
the rider singing head thrown back
golden curls blowing in the breeze
the voice like the singer was small
and dainty and sweet

  i connie morgan had a care in the
world she wasnt going to let it spoil
the keen pleasure of her ride she
had already come five miles this morn-
ing from the tiny log cabin where she
had lived the last three summers with

her father at the foot of the truchas
peaks winters they spent in a big
white house in the little town of
palomas

  connie was going in now to make
arrangements for opening and clean-
ing the town place in another two
weeks by the middle of october they
would have to be moving before some
early snowstorm might pile up its
great white drifts across their trail
already just the night before they
had had a warning flurry and the
ground was still white with it

  connies father had inherited money



  a song on the trail


ranch romances

and a hobby he had a passion for
beautiful horseflesh as his father had
had before him next to connie he
loved more than anything else in the
world his two dozen or so beautiful
slim-legged and slender-bodied bays
blacks and sorrels racing stock they
were from some of the best stables in
america occasionally he entered one
of them in one of the local races at
palomas or vegas as a sort of de-
fiant excuse to the world for owning
them

  every spring now for three years
he had driven his frolicsome spir-
ited pets over the mountain passes to
their high summer home where they
thrived on the luscious grass

  another mile down the trail to the
canyon bottom and connie would be
at the cabin of frenchy arnot ex-
cept for their own there was no other
cabin for miles in all this vast wilder-
ness of high country

  shed stop and see if there was any-
thing frenchy wanted her to do for
him in palomas poor lonesome fear-
driven frenchy people had warned
her about him they said he was crazy
and probably dangerous

  it aint noways natural for a body
to shut hisself up thataway away
from everbody year in an year out
vhy i even hear tell as how a feller
stopped there and wanted to thaw
hisself out by the fire one day an
frenchy chased him away with a gun
like as not hell get to broodin up
there some long winter an kill some-
body yes sir id keep away frum
him if it wuz me garrulous old mrs
obrien who ran the hotel told her

  connie had smiled at this and other
warnings she knew and understood
frenchy theyd been good friends
since that spring shed found him
pinned under a fallen tree with a
broken leg and some smashed ribs

 in the long idle hours while
frenchys old bones were knitting
hed told her a lot about himself and
what he hadnt told her shed been
able to guess

  it was an old story frenchy had
been a chef-a good one-in a big
hotel in the east hed had a son-a
bad one through and through-whom
hed loved as men do love an only son
the boy joe had gotten into trouble
with the police repeatedly and old
frenchy had always managed some-
how to get him out hoping and half
believing each time that this would
be the last that now the boy would
settle down and behave himself

  then frenchy tiring finally decid-
ed that what the boy needed was a
quiet place and plenty of time to
think things over the next time there
was trouble frenchy sat tight neither
putting up the money for bail for his
boy nor hiring him a good lawyer
what is more when the case came to
trial old frenchy appeared as a wit-
ness against joe the judge gave the
boy five years at hard labor

 the state had a case without
frenchys testimony and the boy
might have been convicted anyway
but young joe never believed that
he blamed everything on his father

  after the verdict joe was given a
few minutes to say farewell to
frenchy he had looked at his father
steadily for a minute small black eyes
glittering then with demoniacal de-
termination in his silky voice he said
quietly remember this old man
when my five years are up im going
to kill you

 unheeding frenchys quivering
gray-white face he had turned and
walked away with his guards black
head held high-a reckless swagger-
ing picture of unconcern

  it is a hard thing for a man to lose
hope entirely for a year after that
frenchy had tried to make peace with
his boy going to see him once a week
carrying delicacies of his own making
to him young joe arnots mother had
died in an asylum and he had always
been a queer one but now he had
changed somehow from a wild care-
less youth to a quiet unbalanced man
he lived with but a single purpose-
a song on the trail



to kill his father as soon as he was
free

  always he repeated in that soft
gentle voice of his the threat he had
made the day in the courtroom

  at last despairing beaten old
frenchy had made his way west hid-
ing himself year in and year out in
his little log cabin high in the sangre
de cristo mountains until now after
ten years he was known as the queer
old man of the mountains

  yes connie thought she understood
frenchy arnot small wonder he
chased strangers away from his door
with a gun instead of fearing him
she pitied him from the depths of her
warm generous heart it was a ter-
rible thing she thought to see a man
loving yet at the same time living in
deadly fear of an only son

  another half mile down the canyon
connie drew rein and sat for a min-
ute looking at the golden beauty of
straight trunked aspens contrasted
with white snow and an unbelievably
blue sky she loved this wild moun-
tain country of hers loved every tree
and every curve in the winding old
cow and sheep trails loved the tiny
cabin nestling at the foot of the
rugged truchas peaks

  connie at sixteen fresh from
boarding school in the east had for
the first time followed her father
cross the mountains with the ponies
she had slipped quickly and easily
into a new life in the west she was
nineteen now a tiny perfect rosebud
of a girl barely tipping the scales at
ninety-five pounds with her sky-blue
eyes hair like autumn aspen leaves
and long curling lashes she looked
like an old-fashioned dresden china
doll come to life

  too much so for her own peace of
mind kind-hearted matronly ladies
always insisted on mothering her
gave her overshoes pestered her about
wearing ear muffs and wool stockings

  their concern was well intentioned
but it was just so much poison in
connies cup of happiness cool com-

petent self-sufficient little connie
hated looking like some fragile deli-
cate toy she might have told them
things that would have made their
eyes open but a girl couldnt go
around boasting of things she had
done and besides they probably
wouldnt have believed her

  for instance there was that spring
she had found frenchy pinned under-
neath the top half of a fallen spruce
tree she had single-handed managed
to rig up a sort of block and tackle
and lift the tree top enough to get the
old man out then too there was the
time she had found a grizzly milling
around the horses and her with only
one shell in the rifle she was carry-
ing she hadnt hesitated her aim
was good and her bullet went crashing
through his brain

  of course there was a particular
reason why connie didnt want to be
just another big-eyed blonde with
it that reason was young buck
mindon who was sheriff mindon now
tall straight as an indian face
tanned nut-brown from years of rid-
ing the range he had set connies
heart to thumping the first time she
saw him she had had reason during
those first few months to believe that
he might feel the same way about her
but their acquaintance had ripened no
further than an ordinary friendship
in her presence buck mindon seemed
suddenly to become reserved

  yet stubborn feminine instinct told
connie that he did or at least he
could care for her there had been
an unguarded moment at a dance last
summer when she had looked up un-
expectedly into his face as she
swirled by in another mans arms her
high heels clipping a gay tattoo on
the rough pine floor their eyes had
met and clung for an instant then
they had lost each other again in the
shuttling of the dance

  connie was no fool she thought
she knew why buck mindon seemed
to avoid her and she was determined
somehow to set things right again


ranch romances

  buck mindon was young his sal-
ary as sheriff was small his wife
should he take one would have to do
her own housework would even prob-
ably be left alone for days at a time
on the little ranch where he lived
the life of a sheriffs wife is not easy
doubtless he thought its work and
worry would crush connie make her
prematurely old with a queer old-
fashioned chivalry he would not ask
a toy who looked as if a gust of wind
might blow her away to cook and
scrub and mend for him

  connie gritted her teeth all she
wanted was a chance to prove with-
out telling him so in words that in
reality she was both competent and
as tough as horsehide

  she rode on down the canyon eyes
pensive but with a firm set to her
soft round chin in a few minutes she
was in front of frenchy arnots cabin

  the cabin a one-room affair was lo-
cated about fifty yards to one side of
the trail and almost completely hid-
den behind great clumps of alder and
willow smoke curled lazily out of the
stone fireplace chimney

  with a start of surprise connie
noted a rangy deep-chested gray mare
browsing lazily on an oak bush a few
yards away the horse was a magnifi-
cent specimen of the mountainbred
animal that can hold a long swinging
gait for hours over steep rocky trails
and never tire connie was sure she
had never seen her before her flanks
were wet with sweat and saddle
marks still showed on her back but
she showed no other signs of fatigue
she was not tied and she circled war-
ily as the girl rode near

  who could the visitor be certain-
ly no passing cowboy-on a mare
frenchy had no friends except con-
nie and her father was it possible
that   

  without quite knowing why con-
nie felt a strange pang of apprehen-
sion she slipped down from the sad-
dle and walked to the door

  nobody answered her gentle knock

she glanced at her watch it was
nearly noon frenchy would be com-
ing in soon he wouldnt mind if she
went in and waited for him

  quickly she opened the door inside
all was cleanliness and order a cheer-
ful fire blazed merrily in the fireplace
frenchy had not been gone long a
strange wet leather jacket hung over
the back of a chair before the fire
and again that sharp stab of fear
gripped her

  she warmed herself before the fire
for a few minutes and then began a
restless pacing of the room there was
a small window in the back with a
green shade drawn tightly down to
shut out the blinding glare of sun on
snow before this connie paused

  impatiently she flipped up the
shade and peered out the window

  she froze in her tracks one hand
crept to her throat and she gave a
low choked cry

  two men stood directly back of the
cabin not more than thirty yards
away one of them was old frenchy
he stood in an attitude of pleading
grizzled face quivering shaking
hands outstretched the other towered
over him dark-bearded face laughing
gun in hand

  at their feet was a newly dug hole
in the ground about six feet long by
three feet wide

  connie shivered

  in the instant she stood there para-
lyzed a single shot rang out and old
frenchy a spot of red jumping sud-
denly out on his forehead crumpled
to the ground

  connie grasped the window ledge
for support the room whirled dizzily
around her dry-throated she tried to
scream and made no sound

  horror was succeeded by a fury of
anger old frenchy had been her
friend shed get his murderer shed
show him he couldnt get away with
that stumbling blindly she started
across the room to the door sobbing
under her breath

  halfway there she stopped shed
a song on the trail



just remembered something-some-
thing that made a difference she
didnt have a gun her father had
taken her rifle that morning to hunt a
bear that had killed one of his colts
the night before they had been with-
out shells for his gun a heavy old-
fashioned blunderbuss

  connie gave a short half hysterical
laugh she had a mental picture of
herself-small dainty helpless-look-
ing-defying a maniac murderer with-
out even a gun to back her up the
man was vicious partially crazy the
knowledge of a witness to his crime
would make him desperate

 her eyes darted quickly around
there was frenchys - hanging
by the fireplace on the homemade
deer-foot gun rack hands trembling
with haste she levered the gun re-
peatedly to see if there were shells in
the magazine the gun was empty

  frantically she searched the room
and found none obviously the mur-
derer having the upper hand had
taken all the shells

  she must get control of herself
must think what to do she did not
dare get panicked dropping into the
chair before the fireplace she pressed
slim white fingers to throbbing tem-
ples she knew she had a few minutes
yet before the man outside should
finish his gruesome task of covering
the body

 there was nothing she could do
now to help frenchy except to bring
his murderer to justice connie was
young and it was the first time she
had seen a man die but one look at
the dark red hole in his forehead had
told her that he was beyond human
aid

  she thought of trying to take the
murderer in with frenchys empty
gun reason told her that was foolish
she was so tiny and ineffective-look-
ing a desperate man would take a
chance on her not having nerve
enough to pull the trigger

  she couldnt clear out without the
man behind the house knowing some-

one had been there the snow had
fixed that tracks would give her
away even to a man unused to paying
attention to such things

  could she beat him to town dolly
her mount was fast but could she
hold the pace for ten long gruelling
miles her mind contrasted the beau-
tiful slender-bodied dolly with the
rangy thick-chested gray dolly
wouldnt have a chance after the first
few miles

  how about taking both horses con-
nie peeped out the side window at
the extreme left behind a clump of
oaks she saw a gray tail switch she
estimated the distance with her eye
the gray mare would be within the
mans line of vision so taking the
gray vas out

  then suddenly the plan sprang to
her mind-full grown like minerva
from the head of jupiter it was so
simple so easy that she smiled yet it
would require more courage than any-
thing she had ever done before she
might not be able to do it and the
ruse itself might not work but at
least she could try

  carefully her eyes searched the
room she had left no footprints by
the little back window she didnt

gun back on the rack

  then quietly she slipped out the
door and swung to the saddle

  with her heart in her mouth she
turned dolly easily daintily back
onto the trail connie made no at-
tempt to hurry her

  certainly the murderer would see
by her tracks that someone had been
there almost certainly he would fol-
low lest a possible eye witness to his
crime should escape to tell the au-
thorities what he would do when he
caught up with her-well if her plan
should work as she hoped there
would be no need to worry about

  a mile up the next slope on- the
trail toward town the mare picked up
her ears and whinnied connies heart
seemed to stop beating

  now she told herself do your
stuff hes coming

  icy terror gripped her her throat
felt harsh and dry always before
this in time of trouble she had need-
ed to act quickly without much time
for thought or fear now she would
know if she had the kind of courage
needed to sustain her for long drag-
ging minutes-perhaps

  connie tossed back her head and
tried to sing the first few measures of
cielito lindo her voice was a husky
whispering monotone she swallowed
the lump in her throat wet her lips
and tried again

  the result was bizarre and star-
tling her voice usually so sweet and
true was high now and almost shrill
neither was she able always to hit the
note she aimed at but it was singing
of a sort at least

  she kept doggedly on until she fin-
ished the song she untied from the
saddle the little camp hatchet she al-
ways carried with her and casually
carelessly as she rode beneath an
aspen tree chopped off a limb that
was hanging over the trail a hun-
dred yards farther on she chopped off
another next she paused to slash a
great white blaze upon the trunk of
a trailside fir

  so she rode on up to the hamilton
mesa always aware of that lurking
stalking rider behind her yet never
daring to give sign of that awareness

  on top of the mesa she tried an-
other song still riding easily hatchet
swinging from limber right wrist
this time it was the red river val-
ley her new effort was a little more
successful when she aimed at c she
didnt often miss it any farther than
b

 she thought of buck mindon and
her voice quivered if this man should
shoot her from behind-now-maybe
buck would think she was the guile-

less little fool she looked just a girl
without sense enough to realize her
own danger

  now she was down the trail off the
hamilton mesa to the mora pecos
river still singing intermittently
still nicking off limbs and blazing
occasional trees

  at the mora pecos she stopped to
eat her lunch and rest and water
dolly connie threw herself down by
the creek cowboy fashion and tried
to drink but the water choked her

  now she thought if hes going
to do it this is the time im in the
open an easy shot

  for two long minutes she lay per-
fectly still in the grip of the most
utter and complete terror she had
ever known if she had just had a
gun could just do something that
would put an end to this endless
watching waiting-waiting for she
knew not what

  at last trembling in every muscle
she arose took her lunch cut of the
saddle bag and made a pretense of
eating as the expected shot still did
not come connie grew a little more
confident

  as she swung back into the saddle
she played with the idea of making a
break for it now

  as soon as i get under cover of
the green timber she told herself
im going to put my foot on the
gas

up on the mesa trail a lean dark-
haired bearded man watched
her intently slowly his body relaxed
and he drew a breath of something
like relief he looked down at his
horses feet lay a freshly hewn-off
limb of an aspen tree

  he glanced across the canyon again
to where a tiny rider on a tall bay
mare was just going into the green
timber there was the flash of sun on
steel as the riders right arm swung
up and down from where he watched
he could see a small sprig of some-
thing green fall to the ground
a song on the trail



  a high sweet voice singing a stanza
of the incomparable cielito lindo
came faintly to his ears

 a slow triumphant smile spread
over his swarthy features

  just some damn fool kid whackin
around he said half aloud queer
voice glad i didnt make the mistake
of riding up on her and letting her
see me theres not a chance that she
saw it or shed a made a run for it

  id better get going if i hurry
back i can make it out of these damn
hills by tomorrow night and then
take a train to california guess id
better go back the other way and out
by santa fe someone in that little
town down there might remember
later that i came through and start
asking questions

an hour and a half later it was an
excited half sobbing girl who
tumbled off a tall bay mare into the
arms of sheriff mindon himself she
gasped out her story incoherently be-
tween sobs and gulps

 buck mindors arms tightened
around her just a minute now con-
nie he said gently let me get this
straight what is it you saw

 i saw-i saw-a man kill frenchy
-frenchy arnot you know-the old
prospector who lives near us

 murder connie or was it a-a
fight

 connie shuddered it was just
plain murder-in cold blood frenchy
didnt even have a gun he begged
for his life but the man just laughed
his names joe arnot-frenchys son
i know because frenchy told me all
about him-even showed me his pic-
ture

 when did you see this killing-
today

  she nodded

 then how did you- buck min-
don glanced from dolly to the tiny
figure in his arms he paled suddenly
beneath his tan you witnessed a
murder and the killer let you get
away didnt he follow you did he

try to hurt you connie before she
had time to answer he shook her al-
most fiercely tell me he said
harshly did he hurt you

  she shook her golden head no
i-i dont think he knew i saw it
they were behind frenchys cabin i
saw them out the back window i
didnt even have a gun buck and i
couldnt th-nk of anything else to do
so i just slipped out and came along
as if nothing had happened i even
sang a little as i rode and whacked
off limbs of trees

  you see i thought if i could act
natural and unhurried enough that
hed believe i hadnt seen him i guess
i fooled him too because he didnt
follow any farther than the mora
pecos i suppose he thought that be-
cause i was a woman that id have
screamed and tried to run away if id
seen the murder

  for a long minute buck mindon
stood silent a new light of compre-
hension mingling with the anxiety in
his eyes his hands shook a little as
he dropped his arms and stepped back
he smiled down at her with lips that
were still a little white and grim

  i must be going now connie ill
make it back to frenchys tonight
and get on the trail i ought to catch
him early in the morning shall i take
you over to mrs obrien first

  she managed a tremulous little
laugh

  no im all right now im sorry i
acted like a baby youll-youll be
careful wont you buck dont take
any chances with him hes danger-
ous

  buck mindon looked at her grave-
ly i wont be taking any chances-
now he promised

  connie watched him clatter down
the street and then turned wearily
toward the hotel

  she spent a restless sleepless night
this must be what its like to be a
sheriffs wife she told herself as the
long minutes dragged by

  the next morning she was up early


ranch romances

and downstairs her face showed signs
of what she had been through deep
violet shadows circled her eyes and
her cheeks were drawn and colorless

  she kept watching the hands of her
wrist watch time seemed endless
buck should be back with his prisoner
by ten or eleven she wanted to go
over to the sheriffs office and wait
for them but she was afraid

  buck had had a night in which to
think it over why had she weakened
yesterday lost her nerve and cried so
when he put his arms around her
suppose he had decided that after
all she didnt have the stuff for a
westerners wife connie didnt think
she could stand it if he should look
at her again in the old cool friendly
way

  about eleven oclock she saw him

crossing the street toward the hotel
one arm in a sling somehow she knew
by his stride that he had got his man

  in a panic she got up and crossed
to a window standing with her back
to the room she didnt turn until he
had nearly reached her then what she
read in his face set all her doubts
forever at rest

  his eyes rested on her humbly al-
most reverently took in the trim per-
fection of her tiny figure the lovely
tilt of her small head the blue eyes
that looked at him so wistfully

  a strange new beauty flamed in her
face color returned in a fiocd to her
pale cheeks

  this must be what its like to be
a sheriffs wife she thought and
smiled as buck mindon gently put his
one good arm around her

eyes a corn-flower blue darkening to
violet in moments of abstraction there
was a redeeming feminine inconsis-
tency in her apparel too in the silver
chain of a locket at her bared throat

  yes its his way she repeated as
she smiled frankly me im schooled
to it if daddy didnt buck and fight
leather once in a while id figure his
health was failing

  true jack williams considered but
there werent so many girls who didnt
feel bound to try and reform a man
sally here was a wonder about that
when her father felt like a bust-well
he had one

  it was unusual for a girl even to
enter blue barts bodega the popular
resort of this cowtown but sally
everly went where she pleased if her
father happened to be in the bodega
when she wanted to speak to him in
she went after him although when old
henry everly rolled his tail she gen-
erally let him run now however she
stood poised in the doorway with her
fathers foreman and surveyed her
rowdy sire appraisingly

  mr everly spending his money held
down the end of the bar blue bart
the purple-jawed proprietor was busily
serving the cattle king and his dozen
friends song was in the air

  an the skies are not cloudy all
day chirped willie the wrangler

  ari the deer and the cantaloup
play chanted judge rumble and be-
gan again in a booming basso home
home on the range  

  thats what the tea kettle said
agreed mr everly an another lit
drink wont do us any harm set em up
in the other alley bart a flock o
the same

  cornin up mister everly grinned
the proprietor at the same time slant-
ing a fishy eye at sally who had ar-
rived at her fathers elbow any other
dame he would have chased out ladies
and liquor dont mix so well it was
blue barts solid conviction but old
everlys daughter-well let her own
pa handle her

  no im not a-comin home honey
the stockman took the defensive i
aint boiled nor even simmerin jest
havin a time with the boys

  oh thats all right with me sally
humored the old reprobate only
listen dad- and she whispered in his
ear

  well i reckon i can fend fer my-
self

  maybe so but give it to me she
was smiling but there was plenty of
resolution in her eye

  and from the watch pocket of his
trousers henry everly reluctantly
drew a tiny slip of paper

  guardedly sally examined this
there were scrawled numbers on it
then she quickly snapped this scrap of
paper into the locket on the end of her
silver chain check dad she said
affectionately patting his shoulder
im hitting out for home now and in
the morning ill have a nice brorao-
seltzer for your breakfast

together under the stars the
girl and the rail fence foreman
rode on homeward they spoke little
but each one knew what the other was
thinking

  unlike a good many waddies jack
williams had no false assurance as to
his own abilities he was entirely fear-
less he could handle men-and horses
he was gay courageous popular very
easy-going but that was the trouble

  if youd only not be so rice-so
-damned nice thats what sally
had said to him exasperated crlv this
afternoon she had learned that jack
had been up since dawn comfcirg the
high pasture for a single measly mav-
erick-a hands work not a foremans
everybody puts things off cn you
how do you ever expect to run a spread
of your own

  for who his knee touched hers
as they were riding in

  you know jack

  aw honey he had grabbed her
hand and she had let him hold it a
moment
eight spot



  so now the ride back home was just
another installment of this continued
love story it took a man a hard
smart sagacious man to run an enor-
mous ranch like the rail fence sally
right well knew it and hoped that jack
was such a man

  times were particularly hard just
now beef was way down and it
looked as if thered be mighty little
profit for any of the cattlemen old
everly himself was at the moment just
a little better than solvent four
whole sections of his best grazing land
were heavily mortgaged and while
he did have enough government bonds
in his safe to clear up all indebtedness
there would-if it came to a pinch-
be practically nothing left over for fu-
ture operating expenses the everlys
would pull through the old man for
all his periodic toots had backbone

  but after henry everly was gone-
that in the starlight was what occu-
pied both riders silent they rode
hand in hand to the white bars of the
gate mutely jack dismounted to let
sallys sorrel mare through then
walked up the long lane to the house
at her stirrup

  he took the sorrel there as she
slipped out of the saddle

  ill try to make good sally ill
try to show yuh

  sally had to smile her hand was
on his sleeve but she couldnt resist
the dig let the nighthawk put up
the horses its his job

  well hes way at the end of the
feed lot i could-

  oh there you go again trying
to do everybodys work sally ex-
claimed and there was disappointment
in her tone

  aw sally yuh dont hate me

  her hand slid up his sleeve and
caught his chin firmly no jack
she kissed him on the lips i love
you darling dumbbell

a rumbling sonata of snoring
rolled out of the bunkhouse into
that depth of darkness which precedes

an autumn dawn it was indeed a sound
of surprising variety and volume-
deep bass snores thin falsetto snores
wheezes and whistles

  a couple of nervous milk cows in the
neighboring corral stirred uneasily and
switched their tails a leggy foal in
the feed lot leaped from sleep and
rushed wildly aoout until its mamma
kicked it gently and told it to hush up
and those same cowpokes laugh when
they hear a burro soundin off was
doubtless what the mare told its off-
spring

  even the rather noisy homecoming
of the boss henry everly did not dis-
turb the boys slumbers incidentally
unlike his foreman the boss did not
bother about the nighthawks comfort
the wrangler had damn well better pick
up his buckskin and stable it

  but just one minute later the roar
which shook the prairie would almost
have wakened the dead it was as se-
vere as the explosion of a cannon

  jack williams was out of his bunk
while the earth still shivered and trem-
bled he did not pause even for his
boots though instinctively his fingers
snatched up his gunbelt and sixguns
laid handy on the floor beside him he
was at the door of the bunkhouse al-
most before the others were stirring

  a wavering light in the ranch house
suggested that the scene of the explo-
sion might be yonder in stocking feet
the young foreman ran headlong to-
wards the main building

  then the light disappeared there
came the scuffing and stamping of
horses the low voices of men growling
and swearing slap in yore hooks an
git scarce someone shouted in the
dark well have the whole nest of
em swarmin indeed back at the
bunkhouse the boys of the rail fence
were rallying to follow their foreman

  jack let go one wild shot in the gen-
eral direction of the ranch house he
couldnt see a thing of course but
from beyond the house where their
horses had evidently been bunched
came a spattering volley in answer


ranch romances

bullets went zinging through the air
or pecked into the dust

  it was jack williams impulse to re-
turn that fire but in a crisis he pos-
sessed a cool calm intelligence and he
was aware that emptying his guns at an
invisible target wouldnt be a whole lot
of use moreover such an act might
leave him with empty cylinders in his
long sixes when he came close enough
to fight effectively so both guns
ready although silent he dashed on in

  the racket of galloping hoofs
showed that the enemy were fleeing
still in that blackness before dawn-
the night was clouded now - you
couldnt even glimpse the outline of the
flying horses

  at the same time the clear command
sounded in the deep voice of the one
who was evidently the leader hold
yore fire dont give em a mark

  jack did fire once then in the gen-
eral direction from which the voice had
issued but he got no salvo for an an-
swer this time and so far as he could
know his own shot had been useless
put-a-poom put-a-pcom across the
prairie the thunder of the galloping
horses faded further and further into
the distance the intruders whoever
they were had got away clean

  swiftly there came to jacks mind the
whole understanding of what had hap-
pened robbers had blown the safe in
the ranch house living room anyone
might have known that everly kept
negotiable bonds there and the safe
hopelessly old-fashioned could have
been cracked by any yegg

  and sally

  the girls bedroom was in a wing
true but what if she had been aroused
before the explosion and had gone to
investigate

  her voice called him clothed in a
dark green bathrobe she held a match
high at the living room door

  beyond amid the debris of shattered
plaster her father lay dead

  up from the bunkhouse the rest of
the rail fence boys were already
pounding they were in the living

room by the time jack had lighted the
oil lamp

  no need to take old everlys pulse
or to listen to his heart sally white-
faced wordless needed only to look
at her fathers face a bullet between
the eyes is summary

  it was entirely evident that the old
stockman entering the living room
had come directly upon the thieves just
as they were ready to blow the door of
the safe one of them must have
drilled him ruthlessly almost at the
instant that the dynamite charge was
fired everlys own sixgun dropped
on the floor had not been fired its
bore was unsullied by powder its
chambers fully charged

  the girl in the first shock of the ca-
tastrophe seemed congealed her
mouth was drawn to a thin grim line
her eyes were the hard brilliant blue
of a bitter-cold winter sea when her
lover tried clumsily to offer a word of
comfort she held out one protesting
hand and shook her head standing
there with her back to the wall hands
gripped in front of her she watched
mutely while the men examined the
evidences of the crime it was as if
in her grief and anger she was in a
hypnotic trance

  the door of the ancient safe had
been neatly blown and hung only by
the shred of a hinge that clearly in-
dicated the work either of a profes-
sional peterman-a city criminal expe-
rienced in safe-cracking-or possibly
of a skillful miner these were not just
stray badmen of the range for the aver-
age grub-liner knows nothing of the
use of high explosives

  professional crooks if you ask me
jack remarked squatting in front of
the blown safe

  dragged their picket ropes a long

flats not as weve heared of huh

  well theyve come now jack ex-
pressed the obvious

  an gone said noddy

  but not jack pointed with a fin-
ger with everything they were look-
ing for he was indicating the face of
a flat drawer the strong box set into
the center of the wide-open safe that
drawer operated by a small dial com-
bination lock remained flush and un-
opened they either didnt know that
the ole man cached his government
bonds there jack continued or else
couldnt get at em he turned to
sally you have the combination
for all the grisly situation there was
the sense of the lift of relief within
him sallys body was safe her future
financially provided for

 the girl nodded then she spoke
for the first time as she turned back
towards her bedroom im dressing
well all be riding was all she said

  sally was the authority now si-
lently the cowhands streamed out to
catch up their broncos

  a milky line of dawn across the east
heralded a sunless morning as they
started out guns loose in their leath-
ers loaded cartridge belts sagging on
their thighs the rail fence men
fanned out in a general northerly di-
rection there was the best cover a
gaunt wilderness country mountain-
ous and arid save for the winding flow
of the stream known as buffalo run
this creek cutting often through deep
canyons was impossible to follow con-
tinuously but jack williams had the
wise idea that the murderers would not
stray too far from the streams general
course they and their mounts would
often need water not the easiest thing
to come by in this rugged country

  sally and her foreman held the cen-
ter of the fan-shaped formation the
others were lined out at about quarter-
mile intervals in that rugged terrain
few were in sight of each other at any
one time but it had been agreed that
a quick double shot should be the sig-
nal to rally

  the girl on a pale gray mustang

a handy chunk called ghost rode reck-
lessly they were in a big loop of the
river now working downhill towards
a deep cut in the fiat cold light of
the morning they could distinguish
fresh hoofprints now and then though
the ground was mostly too stony to
carry visible trace but lower down
towards the edge of the stream a dis-
tinct trail evidenced itself the way
was narrowly hemmed in by tumbled
boulders if the killers had planned a
trap-

 it was not a pistol shot which
crashed against jack williams head
but a jagged rock thrown deftly

  sally two rods ahead heard the
thump of the missile and reined back
she saw jack sway in his saddle and
smash against a bulging rock-not
thrown but balancing dizzily

  ghost was yanked around rearing
his forefeet struck and scraped on the
rocks as he tried desperately to turn in
that narrow compass sally leaning
far forward to preserve balance had
her revolver cramped between thigh
and saddle horn she could not jerk
it loose even though a mans figure
rose on a stony shelf almost directly
above her so the noose of a lariat
dropped rather than thrown clamped
her elbows to her body and whipped
her up out of the saddle she felt her
ribs crushed in as if caught in a chain
tourniquet then pain blanked out her
consciousness

nauseated and bruised sally
woke to find herself helplessly
baled up she could move her body
from the waist up though the stabbing
pain of bruised ribs tortured her if she
stirred a muscle any other movement
was effectively prevented though for
her hands were securely lashed to her
own belt buckle in front of her and her
overalled legs had the feel of being
bound together tight at the knees

  from as much as she could perceive
she was able to gather only that she
must be somewhere at the back of a
cave the dim ruddiness of firelight


ranch romances

shone upon the damp vaulting of the
roof above there was from that gen-
eral direction too the sound of the
plashing flow of water she must be in
a hide-out in buffalo run

  gritting her teeth against the pain it
caused her sally writhed her body
round till she could look in the direc-
tion of the outer cave where there was
the grumble of mens voices

  four figures faces masked to the
eyes sat around a lantern they were
intently playing black-jack their pris-
oner saw and it was no penny-ante
game either they were handling con-
siderable sums of money bank notes
as well as small stacks of silver half
dollars and quarters

  hit me came the low-voiced re-
iteration or else and again   
enough    stand on this some-
one said

  ill pay eighteen that would be
the dealer

  sink that damned mutilated eight
spot another man snarled ill be
damned if ill play with marked cards
wonder hed have to cut up the only
deck o cards we got jest like a
sneakin-

  shut yore damn fool face was the
sharp interruption else itll be
slapped shut for yuh that was the
dealer a quick glance over his
shoulder had glimpsed the reflection of
the lamplight in the supposedly uncon-
scious captives eyeballs so yore
awake sister

  the dealer laid down his deck of
cards rose and came over to where
sally crouched he was a big bulky
man his eyes startlingly pale through
the slits in his mask treated yuh
sort o rough hey too bad but we
had to kid yuh was getting a mite
too close to home no hard feel-
ins were just rough big-hearted
fellers

 what-what happened to jack
williams that was her immediate
concern the man i was riding with
whats he to yuh-lover

  i love him yes

  so  mused the big man well
now if i tell yuh-

  there was a sharp interruption
aw can the chatter an tell her to
come across with the combination to
open the strong box a stoop-shoul-
dered man with long arms which dan-
gled ape-like had risen and was hold-
ing the lamp high so that there was
more light in the inner cave he like
the others was masked with black
calico not a makeshift scarf wound to
the eyes but a stitched hand-made af-
fair to the girls quick intelligence
this was proof that these were not in-
deed mere casual criminals but thieves
of careful intent

  check thats right said the first
man we got yuh here sister we
aim to keep yuh awhile say until
yuh tell the combination to that locked
box in yore safe

  the locket against her flesh seemed
suddenly hot if they should guess
what was in that but she managed to
control her voice to answer flatly i
dont know

  shes lyin o course she savvies
broke in a third member of the gang
masked uniformly with the others
she led her ole man around by the
nose tough old wampus though he was
hed sure have told her

  we got ways of makin yuh talk
sweetness murmured the leader
malevolently we wouldnt like to
hurt a nice girl but-

  frightened as she was sally used
her brain it suddenly occurred to her
that here was a way to find out the
truth about jack williams i tell you
i dont know so much was the truth
for she had not memorized the num-
bers for all that they were there plain
to read in the locket against her skin
but now the chance by a misleading
statement to learn of her lover
prompted her to say jack williams
had the slip with the numbers on it
in his shirt pocket

the long-armed rogue exploded
an we let him get away cathcart
too late a savage elbow jolted him
eight spot



in the midriff we didnt search his
corpse yuh mean corrected the
leader

  but the correction came too late if
jack williams had been killed they
would certainly have stripped him in
search of cash and valuables and most
of all for a possible clue to the strong
boxs combination no sallys lover
was alive free and so would surely
come looking for her likely before
dark fell again meantime-

  for all her physical shrinking the
calm strength of her will allowed her
to maintain a brave front the four
ruffians grumbled and growled ar-
gued hesitated but in the end they
did nothing they could not be sure
that she really did know the combina-
tion of the lock to the strong box
however lawless and brutal they still
had the westerners traditional loath-
ing of any act of violence towards a
woman

  the hours drew along while they
half heartedly gambled with their tat-
tered and mutilated playing cards it
was reasonable to suppose that with
the return of night they would attempt
an escape from a neighborhood which
must by now be fairly swarming with
vengeful searchers

  then sore as was her body and un-
comfortable her position sally must
have slept for she woke to hear an
entirely new voice-a very heavy bass
disguised she was quite sure so some-
one else had come to the cave to join
her four captors not a friend
though

  by midnight ill meet yuh i know
the way those particular words
were distinct meanwhile get it off
her an bring it to me at- the voice
went trailing away as the speaker un-
seen in the outer cave moved off
towards the dens opening

  almost instantly though the man
cathcart the one sally had thought of
as the leader entered the inner cave
carrying a patent flash this he coolly
pocketed and then in the dark with-
out a word seized the girls chin in

his left hand jerked her head back sav-
agely and with a clawing right hand
tore the locket from its chain

  using his flash for an instant he
clicked the lockets lid open to dis-
cover the scrawled scrap of paper
here all right he called to the men

a man with a fractured skull may
have his lucid moments but
whatever his determination no exer-
cise of will can keep him straddling a
horse for long jack williams with
bloodied head had been powerless to
control his panicked bronc but he
had been borne away clear out of the
narrow cut and into open grazing land
before he finally toppled there he
was quickly discovered and carried
back to the bunkhouse long hours he
lay in a daze

  sump flats had turned out to a man
to try to run down the murderers of the
old rail fence owner henry everly
had been well liked moreover the
wounding of his foreman and the ab-
duction of the girl had set the whole
county seething with anger trigger-
fingers itched and a hundred riders
went fanning out from the ranch
spurring into the hides of as many con-
trary cayuses

  judge rumble the saloonkeeper
blue bart titus the gentlemanly
gambler sheriff arp and banker bur-
cheil had all assembled to pursue the
hunt they stopped for a word with
the injured foreman who lay con-
scious only now and then under the
ministrations of doc wren the local
physician veterinarian and coroner

  sheriff arp no modern sleuth had
been able to deduce little as to the iden-
tity of the criminals sump flats had
been enjoying-or suffering-a mild
homestead boom and many a saddle-
bum moocher and tinhorn sashayed
through the town this dirty job
would have been the work of strang-
ers but which ones

  nor was the sheriff particularly
adept in his pursuit of clues dozens
of inquisitive amateur investigators


ranch romances

went rambling about through the ranch
house inspecting the shattered safe
viewing the spot where everly fell
messing up whatever minute items of
evidence there possibly might have
been

  till after dark the posses combed
empty draws but before nine oclock
in the evening the first enthusiasm of
the pursuit bogged down most of the
amateur hunters hungry and weary
came trailing in on tired horses to the
bunkhouse of the rail fence the
sheriff for the tenth time was trying
to draw some definite details from the
wounded and dizzied foreman while
the judge blue bart titus and half
a dozen others fidgeted around jacks
bunk

  the hands of the bunkhouse clock
stood exactly at right angles to indi-
cate nine oclock when the distant fus-
illade opened

  everyone but the old doctor was im-
mediately out and off again it was a
welcome thrill for most of them after
so many hours of futile casting about
but old doc wren surgeon through
indian wars sitting coroner in the
wake of many a cowtown fracas was
content to stay at his post and watch
his patients temperature a mean
thing a fractured skull may not
amount to anything or may knock a
man out as suddenly as a puff of breath
snuffs out a candle

  afar off sounded gunfire in a con-
tinual tut-tut-tut-tut punctuated now
and then by the flatter distinctive note
of a long rifle it was a veritable can-
nonade there could be little doubt
that over the buttes and barrancas the
boys were harrying the killer gang

  no moon but a brilliant starlight
would give illumination enough for
the battle as doc wren perceived
staring out of the bunkhouse window
but at that he cynically observed
tharll be more of our own boys nicked
than any of the others whereupon
he moved over to the stove to sterilize
some more knives and probes

  jack from the bed spoke lucidly for

the first time good business for yuh
tonight doc he said then remem-
bering the situation doc docwheres
sally

  the physician shook his head as he
shot an appraising glance at his pa-
tient the flush had seeped from
jacks face he was if anything too
pale now the doctor left his scalpels
to boil and went over to take jacks
pulse slow yeah-but steady

 sally sally i remember-she
was ridin just ahead o me when-

 when somebody dropped a whole
hunk o hillside right crack on yore
conk agreed wren inelegantly but
accurately but dont yuh git all of
a whew about sally everly men
huh she can handle em like a good
workin hand handles a bunch o
dogies

  but what happened to her is she
out in that

  gunfire echoed now more brokenly
and what sporadic shots still detonated
seemed actually to be approaching
now and then too down wind drifted
the shrill yip-e-e-e the cowboy shout
of triumph a distant vague rever-
beration told that a cavalcade was re-
turning

  sounds like theyd corralled the
lot mused doc wren that sheriff
fer all hes thicker than a stout cedar
post aint one to drop his hand till hes
played it to the limit sure enough
here they come and he stared
through the window bringin home
the bacon

  with sally

  tut tut is that nice the tough
old codger jollied dead hawgs make
bacon he supplemented cynically

  there was no necessity to explain
this very gruesome jest several of the
sump flats boys were riding double
with led horse which carried things
which were not-well-riders

  one rail fence hand and one deputy
sheriff had been sadly brought home to
die but the bodies of the four strang-
ers which were carried in to be laid on
the bunkhouse floor were far past doc
eight spot



wrens ministrations in the case o
these four he could serve only as
coroner

  the story of their capture and anni-
hilation was briefly told north of
buffalo run riley jones and bing
noddy had spied hailed and chal-
lenged them in the running fight
which had ensued as reinforcements
swept up the four bandits had been
mown down but not a one of them
had spoken before he died there was
yet no clue to sallys fate

  with a rising fever jack williams
tried to sit up demanding news of the
girl he loved

  ill give yuh a shot of the needle
doc wren threatened i told yuh that
girl could fend for herself

  dizzily jack heaved himself up from
his bunk

  grab im hell kill himself one
of the boys exclaimed

  im goin-goin-to find her jack
insisted

  hombre yore goin to sleep was
the physicians reply

  prompt in an emergency doc wren
drove his hypodermic needle hard into
jacks shoulder while several cow-
hands held the man and forced him
back onto the blankets quickly be-
cause of his feeble condition the nar-
cotic took effect he lay presently in
merciful unconsciousness

  we will now gents the doctor re-
marked imperturbable as ever per-
ceed to view the remains you bart
he spoke to the saloonkeeper turn out
their pockets and you brother
titus bein a hand at figgers make a
list o what yuh find on ary corpse
letterin em a b c an d

  sheriff arp who had been back and
forth to the ranch house restlessly sud-
denly appeared in the door  they
did get those govment bonds was his
sudden announcement

  somebody indeed had purloined the
bonds somehow the drawer in the
safe which served as strong box and
which had been locked tight at the dis-
covery of the murder the night before

was now slightly open-and empty it
had not been jimmied or blown loose
someone had got hold of the dial com-
bination and placidly helped himself

 one o these fellers couldve
sneaked back mebbe riley jones
suggested pointing to the grim rank
of corpses he mightve got the com-
bination- he broke off to look ner-
vously at the heavily slumbering fore-
man then went on-from-from
sally

  the rat cursed a dozen

  turn em inside out bart croaked
the sheriff one of emll have the
papers on him he probly thought
hed made a good haul

 bing noddy suggested hard to
cash where hes at

 blue bart and titus rapidly went
over the bodies

 there was a considerable sum of
loose cash several hundred dollars in
bank notes and silver and gold pieces
but on none of the thieves was there
any trace of a negotiable government
bond for the rest there was only the
useless collection of junk which men
are accustomed to carry in their
pockets knives a rabbits foot a cou-
ple of horsehair fobs various scraps of
paper tobacco sacks sulphur matches
girls pictures a sentimental piece of
poetry only a single postcard taken
from the body of the biggest bandit
offered anything which might be even
remotely considered to promise any
lead

 the postcard read on the address
side mr chris cathcart oklahoma
city okla the message on the other
side was printed out an ordinary
enough message in any cattle country

  take it easy there are no box cars
ready for movement to el paso now
road not open yet get beef here before
a week from next saturday and there wont be
no great hurry make deal by barter or trade
of two for one

 innocent looking as the card was
the sheriff and the rest stared at this
thing till they were dizzy

 anybody mightve sent it an it


ranch romances

might mean anythin or nothin the
baffled officer of the law said shaking
his head sadly to run down a crowd
of crooks and wipe them out and then
to discover that the master criminal
had whisked away clean-a swell dish
but if i kin only lay hands on any
friend o this here cathcarts sheriff
arp went on any live friend that
is-

  jack where is he came a choked
cry at the doorway

  breathless covered with dust bare
arms scarred and blistered from the
rawhide which had bound her and
which she had had to burn loose in or-
der to free herself sally everly stum-
bled into the bunkhouse her eyes
were blazing but beautiful for all that
they were deep-sunk behind cheek
bones smeared with soot and there
was clotted blood on her throat where
the chain of the locket had been
wrenched asunder

  but careless of all comment she
dropped on her knees by the semi-con-
scious sufferer pillowing his head
against her breast jack jack dear-
est

  dont take on miss sally the doc-
tor told her hes jest enjoyin sweet
slumber hell come to in his own
good time

  then well carry him up to the
house the girl ordered peremptorily
lift him some of you boys

  several jumped to obey her

  wal bing noddy commented as
they carried the sleeping man out i
aim to heir his bunk

  till he comes back agreed riley
bing noddy made a good guess i
low he aint a-comin back to the bunk-
house hombre

  removal to the ranch house had how-
ever roused jack williams from his
pleasant torpor for a minute or two
it was idle blissfulness to rest his
throbbing head against the shoulder of
the girl he loved then dawning recog-
nition of her own injuries startled him
into full consciousness honey he
gasped did they maul yuh

  rest easy darling she told him
and proceeded quietly to recount the
details of her capture-the intermin-
able game of cards the entrance of the
fifth man the violent theft of the
locket which obviously had led to the
disappearance of her government
bonds well be dirt-poor now jack
theyll foreclose on the whole rail
fence well have to begin all over
dear

  in a cabin on buffalo run with
three hens and a burro her lever
grinned well thats all right with
me but they aint outdrawn us yet
let me think over what yuh told me
sally for all her warm-hearted emo-
tional impetuousness had a very clear
head on her shapely shoulders she
had neglected no incident of her long
day of imprisonment in the cave in-
cluding the detail of the peculiarly
mutilated playing card she had been
able to identify the dead men accu-
rately enough from the brief glance
shed had of them in the bunkhouse
sheriff arp accompanying her to the
ranch house had displayed the small
scrap of evidence he had garnered the
ambiguous postcard she told jack
about that too

  that eight spot-now thats curi-
ous jack now reflected going over
her story in his mind yuh dont
know what suit it was guess it dont
matter all eight spots have their
spots set on em alike ai-e-e-e he
jerked himself upright and thought his
whole scalp was likely to burn off

  tenderly sally eased him back against
the pillows easy cowboy what
is it

  just an idea go ask sheriff arp
to come up here he muttered when he
was able to control the throbbing of his
head enough to permit himself to think
lucidly ask him on the quiet honey
without the others knowin

  hatched something jack

mebbe not but got a hen on an
tip him to bring that postcard he got
off the guy that was called cathcart
no sooner had the girl gone out into
eight spot



the darkness than the wounded man be-
haved like a very undisciplined invalid
brutal as the pain in his head was he
slipped out of the bed whisked out to
the living room of the ranch and there
possessed himself of two articles-a
deck of cards and the late henry ev-
erlys revolver

  battling the blinding dizziness which
seemed to club at his brain he got back
into his bed without being observed
tucked the revolver under the bed-
clothes by his hip and then performed
a peculiar operation upon the first eight
spot of cards which came to his hand-
it happened to be an eight of clubs he
carefully poked out all the black spots
leaving a white oblong of pasteboard
with eight symmetrically arranged
punctures in it

  sally came back with the sheriff

  honey jack told her us mend
now admire to stage a stag party
would yuh be good an kind enough
to round up the judge blue bart titus
an the doc those fourll be sufficient
send em in to me an wait awhile out-
side

  if sally everly resented this brusque
taking over of her authority she did
not at least evidence it or-just
maybe-she reminded herself that she
was no longer the boss here with the
loss of the bonds the rail fence was no
longer hers it would be corralled by the
bankers gracefuly enough therefore
she took orders from her foreman

  silent evidently uneasy the four
men who had thus been summoned
came trooping into the ranch house bed-
room

  sheriff arp stood just by the door so
that all four had to pass him and stand
a little in front of him as they faced the
man in the bed

  i have here said jack williams
producing the postcard the sheriff had
loaned him a right interestin docu-
ment weve all of us used stencils-
smack im sheriff

  the keeper of the bodega blue bart
had suddenly gone for his sixgun

  so swift had been the move that the

slow-witted sheriff had not been pre-
pared

  only the very mercy of the extreme
speed of barts draw which made aim-
ing difficult sent the first bullet sogging
into the wall over the beds head-board

  jacks gun spoke then and blue bart
went down

  the neat packet of bonds was in the
dead mans inner pocket

the room had been tidied up by the
removal of the remains the
wounded man and his nurse were alone
in the lamplight

  sally was still eying that betraying
postcard with the punctured eight of
clubs superimposed upon it as in a
stencil the eight damning words stood
out through the soles in the playing
card

easy	box

to

open	here

                       saturday
                   hurry	bart

  so that was the reason for the muti-
lated eight spot it was a sort of secret
decoding device which enabled the men
to read the cryptic messages sent them
by their chief

  the invalid grinning observed
thisd sure make a funny-soundin
story you doin all the fightin takin
all the risks gettin away from those
rogues and me just lyin here dreamin

  and finding me the money her
fingers caressed his hot forehead

  sho i had to find yuh yore money
sweet but this yarn sure got saddled
backward

  what was the old song dear she
couldnt help teasing him tenderly
for men must work and women must
weep

  that poet sure pulled a boner it
went hind end to this time

  sally said of course i do like to
be called brave but darling you are
smarter

  no his cheek touched hers its
only the result of a wicked an wasteful
youth honey i just know more about
playin cards
  the valley of dispute

by eric howard

  they called him rolling stone and certainly he had gathered no moss but that was
  before he came to clear creek valley and laid eyes on anne who charmed him with

her radiant smile

iding down from the pine
meadows where he had camped
last night jerry stone sud-
denly pulled up his roan horse
and stared down into the small green
valley a rough map that had been
drawn for him told him that this was
the disputed territory

  he reached into his saddle bag and
took out a pair of high-powered field
glasses with them to aid his natur-
ally far-sighted eyes he could see
the thin trickle of sparkling water
that flowed through the center of the
little valley its source was the spring
that was the particular object of con-
tention between the c cross owner
and the circle four outfit

  but it wasnt the valley itself beau-
tiful as it was that had attracted his
attention he had seen the movement
of animals down there in and out of
the aspens that fringed the green
meadow cattle no doubt

 then he realized that they were
horses and that each horse bore a rider
he was too far away to make out
their brands but he judged that they
were circle four riders he frowned
remembering that the big outfit had
agreed to keep the peace and to stay
away from the disputed valley until
he had completed his- survey that
was the injunction of the court

  he rode on down the trail part of
the time the valley was obscured by


the valley of dispute



trees and outcropping rocks but
whenever he could see it jerry swung
his field glasses to his eyes and sur-
veyed the scene he saw about fifteen
horsemen on one side of the thin
stream they seemed to be confront-
ing someone lined up on the opposite
side of the valley but who it was
jerry could not see

  he rode faster hoping to reach a
place of vantage before his presence
was discovered a shot rang out and
he saw a puff of smoke from the gun
held by one of the riders an answer-
ing shot came from the other side and
then many guns spoke

  jerry spurred his horse whirled off
the dim trail and started down the
steep slope he came out on a level
expanse halfway down the hill and
halted again the horsemen he had
seen were riding away those who had
answered their attack let them go

  he continued down into the valley
his field glasses were replaced and
his hand was near his holstered gun
in his saddle boot he carried a rifle

  stop or ill shoot came a sharp
command

  jerry had emerged from a thicket
of aspens in spite of his cautious
advance he had been seen he stopped
and slowly lifted his hands mean-
while looking for the owner of the
voice a slim figure came out from
the brush

  howdy said jerry easily i rode
down when i heard ail the shootin
looks like you run off all them
hombres i aint one of em if thats
what you thought

  he observed that the hand which
held a gun leveled at him wavered
he saw too that the hand was quite
small

  lordy youre a girl he exclaimed
and swung down from his saddle

  dont come near the girl cried
dont

  jerry obediently stood beside his
horse his hands raised again

  shucks maam you dont have to
foe afraid of me im jerry stone sur-

veyor an deputy sheriff appointed
by the court to run a survey through
here an find out who owns this spring
an valley i reckon you must be miss
custer of the c cross an them fellers
that jest left here was from the circle
four right

  the girl nodded and allowed her
gun to fall at her side jerry grinned
and lowered his hands

  youre really jerry stone appoint-
ed by the court she asked

  yes maam i sure am

  buck dawson-hes the circle four
superintendent-said youd never get
here he said hed see that you were
stopped and turned back

  hm well it looks like mr daw-
son kind o miscalculated here i am
jerrys gray eyes twinkled and a
faint smile hovered on the lips of the
girl then jerry heard a groan of
pain and the girl turned swiftly and
took two steps into the brush jerry
followed there on the ground lay a
gray-haired man his hat had fallen
at his side and there was a dark stain
of blood on his flannel shirt

  dad cried anne custer heres
jerry stone the surveyor hes come
at last

  the old man on the ground gritted
his teeth and looked up at jerry

 them fellers attack you two
jerry asked jest you two lord i
thought there was a whole army of
you from the way they was shootin
he knelt beside jim custer and
opened his shirt examining the wound

  we been expectin you custer
said through tight lips we figgered
theyd obey the courts injunction till
you settled things but they wont
im all right anne girl get my horse
well ride for home

  on that ride to the c cross ranch
house with anne on one side of her
father and jerry on the other the
young man heard their version of the
boundary dispute the spring and
half of the green valley had always
been considered a part of the c cross
spread until the circle four ranch


ranch romances

was bought by a syndicate and buck
dawson placed in charge of it

  dawson with big plans for the de-
velopment of the ranch had soon
claimed the whole valley and all the
water of the spring jim custer had
taken the dispute into court with
the result a survey had been ordered
made and both parties had been en-
joined to avoid conflict

  dawson however had failed to live
up to his agreement one of custers
riders had seen a suspicious fire down
in the valley and upon investigating
had found two c cross calves bearing
the circle four brand

  its easy to change c cross into
circle four anne pointed out and
thats what hes been doing dad and
i rode out this morning and we met
those men there dawson was with
them dad reminded them that the
court had ordered them to stay away
from the stream dawson laughed and
some pretty hot words followed then
one of them began shooting

  i saw that jerry nodded but i
wasnt close enough to see any of em
this dawson must be pretty bad
huh

  scum ejaculated jim custer
scum thats what he is hell stop at
nothin to get what he wants hes
told us what hell do to you we
thought mebbe youd been scared out
already

  not yet jerry grinned whimsi-
cally i havent seen dawson yet of
course so im not scared out you
cant tell-i may be when i meet up
with him

  hes scared out plenty grunted
custer

  but anne was looking steadily at
jerry as though testing his quality
and strength she saw a mouth and
chin firm and resolute in spite of his
slow smile and she recognized that
beneath his easy good humor there
was something of steel or of stone

  i guess he wont scare you out
she nodded satisfied

  at the ranch after jim custer had

been made comfortable and a rider had
been dispatched to cabazon for a
doctor jerry stone sat on the porch
steps and watched the slim quick-
moving figure of anne as she went
about directing the work of the men
he admired her competence almost as
much as he admired that direct level
glance out of her blue eyes and the
rose flush on her tanned cheeks

  she came and sat down beside him
as he had hoped she would

  this feller dawson said jerry
voicing the thoughts that had been
running through his mind it seems
like he was takin a long chance at-
tackin you

  he didnt know i was there at
first anne told him he thought
hed got dad alone when he saw me
he was surprised he doesnt want any
witnesses to what he does and then
i think he saw you riding down and
thats what made them leave maybe
he didnt know who you were but
you came just in time

  glad of that jerry nodded al-
though i wouldnt a been much use
against that mob ill start out in the
mornin an look the situation over
then the next day mebbe your father
will lend me one of his hands an i
can get to work

  dawson will try to make trouble
for you one way or another

  i reckon he might but i been
appointed to run a line through that
valley an i guess i have to do it
there was something very pleasant
about the c cross outfit to jerry
stone homeless wanderer of the
range sitting at the table with anne
and later before the great fireplace in
the living room he began to reflect
upon the wisdom of settling down
they had called him rolling stone
down on the border and he had cer-
tainly gathered no moss of experi-
ence he had had a plenty he had
known danger and he had followed
the bright trail of adventure that
was what he was doing now he
thought stroking his chin
the valley of dispute



  none of the regular deputies had
wanted this job he remembered that
they had all protested that they
werent surveyors the sheriff had
seized upon jerry and had eagerly
appointed him to carry out the courts
order he grinned to himself the
sheriff had known what he was send-
ing him into and he hadnt given him
so much as a hint of dawsons caliber
but he was glad he had come

  the doctor from cabazon arrived
interrupting the friendly conversation
jerry and anne were having and
with the doctor came a young man
who was introduced as stanley vail
jerry took an immediate dislike to
him for no other reason than the
cordiality with which anne welcomed
him stan vail was a laughing happy
curly-haired cowboy he had a way
with him as he caught annes hands
and held them looking down at her
affectionately

  i heard your dad had been shot
he said so i rode right out with the
doctor

  thanks stan

  how is he honey

  anne didnt try to take her hands
out of his and she didnt object to
the word of endearment jerry stone
busying himself with the rolling of
a cigarette felt the blood rise in his
cheeks he rebuked himself sternly
and caustically just because anne had
been pleasant and friendly to him a
stranger didnt mean that he had any
right to object to her friendliness
toward others no doubt she loved
this big good-looking stan vail was
that any business of his jerry
stones it wasnt but for all that
he felt a vague resentment

  when anne had followed the doctor
into her fathers room vail sat down
before the nre and spread his hands
to the blaze

  so youre goin to survey clear
creek valley he asked

  jerry had dealt with men of all
types in his wanderings he had
learned to weigh not only their words

but their manner of speech and so he
caught an overtone of mockery of
derision in stan vails question

  thats what i was sent here for
he answered obliquely an it looked
easy enough they didnt tell me about
dawson

  that was a bid for vail to express
his opinion he merely laughed

  didnt they tell you what dawson
did to another surveyor that came
here asked vail after a moment

 jerry shook his head and vail
laughed again

  jerry wondered why vail friendly
to the custers probably in love with
anne had not allied himself with
them in their fight with dawson he
himself had already taken their side
had decided that they were in the
right otherwise dawson wouldnt
have attacked them fifteen men
against a man and a girl

  dawsons a big man over this way
vail volunteered the county seat an
the sheriff are too far away to bother
him he does what he likes

  yeah but in this boundary dis-
pute how come hes been allowed to
do what he likes one of his men shot
jim custer today how come the men
of this section stand for that

  vail shrugged nobody big enough
to buck him he said with an apprais-
ing glance at jerry the s bar o-
thats where i work-has kept him off
our range so far but the boss aint
lookin for trouble

  so you jest let him shoot up any-
body he dont like asked jerry
mildly you let him try to kill jim
custer an mebbe injure miss anne
me demanded vail angrily i-
then he smiled again i reckon you
wont do anything once dawson gets
to you

  mebbe jerry granted

 when anne and the doctor came
out of custers room reporting that
he was resting easily and not badly
hurt jerry got up and said good
night he went to the room anne had
shown him earlier and lay awake for


ranch romances

hours pondering on the situation
vail he was sure had tried to im-
press him with the impossibility of
carrying out his task there was no-
body big enough to buck dawson
jerry grunted in disgust he would
suspend judgment until he had met
dawson but from what he knew of
him he was an imitation badman run-
ning loose on the range

  tomorrow hed make a preliminary
inspection of the spring and the val-
ley perhaps hed meet dawson

 hours after he had gone to his
room long after the doctor had left
jerry saw stan vail ride away he
scowled

early the next morning after
a hasty breakfast in the kitchen
jerry saddled his roan and rode off
toward clear creek valley after
reaching the spring high above the
valley he followed the stream down
to the point where its waters poured
into a blue lake which was indispu-
tably on c cross land dawson in
claiming the spring and the valley
intended to impound the water by
building an earth dam and creating
an artificial lake from which he could
irrigate the circle four bottom lands

  there was much at stake nothing
was so valuable as water on this range
and the possession of the spring
meant everything to the c cross the
circle four a bigger spread had
plenty of water on other parts of its
land

  as jerry had half expected a rider
approached him from the circle four
side of the valley pretending that
he had not seen him jerry rode on
slowly

  hey you what you doin here

  jerry halted and turned waiting
for the other to ride close as the
man advanced he was sure that it was
dawson and as he looked at the
mans heavy pockmarked face a
flicker of surprise passed over his
own dawson was wearing the usual
range garb but as jerry looked at

him he saw him in different clothes

  he saw him mounted on a chestnut
arabian with a silver-studded saddle
and ornamented bridle wearing tight
mexican trousers a silk shirt and a
short jacket with his oily black hair
topped by a flat-crowned sombrero
he saw him riding into the border
town of los alamos at the head of
a band of men again he listened to
the warning cries of the people as
they took refuge behind the barred
doors of their houses he heard again
the name which struck terror into
their hearts the name was not daw-
son

  what you doin here the rider
demanded again

 jerry smiled the advantage was
his decidedly he knew dawson yet
dawson had never seen him before

  i reckon its none of your busi-
ness jerry drawled but i dont
mind tellin you

  he explained who he was watching
dawson closely what would have
been an ingratiating smile in another
man crossed dawsons face and he
thrust out his hand with an exclama-
tion of pleasure

  been expectin you he boomed
we sure want this dispute cleared
up why didnt you come right along
to the circle four we can make you
comfortable an help you while youre

over our way dont blame you he
leered at jerry and laughed again
but well be glad to help you out
jest come along an let me show you
where this line oughta be the way
we see it

  jerry followed him and listened to
his explanations they didnt ring
true but he made no comment he
was waiting for some definite pro-
posal from dawson it came later as
a result of something jerry said
the valley of dispute



dawson had asked if he were a regu-
lar deputy and he replied that he had
taken the job because he was broke

  say dawson caught him up you
wont get much out of this-jest
wages no use wastin a lot o time on
it custers had the use of this water
quite a spell but its circle four
property all right thats plain
enough he waited a moment then
hurried on spose you make a quick
job of it an go back an report the
line runs here he gestured with a
sweep of his arm huh i could make
it worth five hundred mebbe

  jerry laughed you tryin to bribe
me dawson no he shook his head
i was taught always to do my duty
i got to run a survey through here
all right an proper

  shucks said dawson with that
same ingratiating smile of course
you do i was jest jokin forget it
these days most men can be bought
-i was tryin you out now i can
see youre square an goin to do

anne custers smiles bribe you huh

sternly they tell me another sur-
veyor was here did you bribe him-

  lordy no boomed dawson that
feller was scared of his shadow
somebody filled him full o hot air
told him i was plumb ornery an he
jest quit im glad to see you on the
job cause we want this matter set-
tled

  shortly afterwards dawson left him
with another handshake and hearty
words jerry watched him smiling
slightly he had deliberately avoided
all mention or the scene he had wit-
nessed the day before he had allowed
dawson to think he was taken in by
his overly cordial manner but he
knew that failing to bribe him sus-
picious of him because he was staying
at the c cross and evidently not
wishing to try to scare him off daw-
son would resort to other methods
when the time came

-ranch romances-first sett

  late that day he rode back to the
c cross and went in to see jim cus-
ter the old rancher was sitting up
staring somberly out of the window
when jerry entered he turned with
a smile and gestured to another chair

  they discussed the boundary line
for some time but jerry made no
mention of dawsons attempt to bribe
him as he got up to leave the room
jim custer put out his hand

  i took a likin to you young fel-
ler he said an i want to tell you
something you seem like an easy-
goin square-shootin man the sheriff

  if you report that were right

hell get you what the sheriff oughta
do is to send a lot of men here on
this job not one one man hasnt got
a chance im tellin you this cause i
dont want to see you get hurt youd
better go back an tell the sheriff you

  an then hell send somebody that

  jim custer nodded i reckon
jerry shook his head ill stay till

day seems right friendly i wont

knows youre goin to report in our
favor-the way youll have to bein
square-he wont let you make that
report

  thanks for tellin me but ill

  meeting anne in the hall as he left
the room jerry was puzzled by her
impersonal unfriendly nod she passed


ranch romances

him quickly going into her fathers
room and closed the door jerry
stared the friendliness of the day
before had vanished

  as he went out on the porch jerry
saw stan vail riding down the lane
toward the road to cabazon he nod-
ded to himself vail had been talking
to anne about him he lounged
against a porch pillar staring across
at the rolling hills when this job
was done and he had made his report
hed be riding again into new country
no use staying in one place but he
wouldnt have minded staying at the
 cross

  presently anne called to him say-
ing dad would like to see you a
moment

  when he went back into the room
the rancher scrutinized him for a long
moment then he spoke his friendly
paternal attitude of a few minutes
before seemed to have vanished too

  i believe in sayin whats on my
mind we been told stone that daw-
son is boastin hes bought you up
when i advised you to leave this job
undone my warnin didnt seem to
worry you now dawson claims hes
bribed you did you meet him today

  yeah

  did he bribe you custer leaned
forward

  jerry looked from him to the girl

  i reckon youll have to find that
out from the messenger boy that
brought you this here news he
drawled if dawson did bribe me i
wouldnt be tellin if he didnt an
says he did it wouldnt do me much
good to talk ill leave the talkin to
him an mister vail

  he turned toward the door

  i wouldnt a listened to it said
jim custer half apologetically if
you hadnt acted so plumb careless
about buckin dawson

  jerry grinned

  dawsons a kind of bogey man
around here he remarked vail was
tellin me how bad he is an you too
looks like nobody wants me to survey

that valley how do i know but what
dawsons bribed vail

  weve known stan vail a long
time said jim custer

  an you dont know me at all
jerry smiled well all im askin of
you is the help of one man

  he left them passing anne with
an amused glance and he knew that
they would discuss him after he had
gone later at the table and in the
big living room they were hospitable
enough but the friendly warmth of
the day before had disappeared they
werent sure of him didnt trust him
well it couldnt be helped he went
to his room early after custer had
told him that slim purdue would help
him the next day purdue was one of
the oldest men on the ranch and un-
questionably loyal to custer

jerry and slim left the ranch early
and had been at work for several
hours when slim came running down
to where jerry stood

  theyre cornin he cried daw-
son an some of his gang we better
duck out o here

  let em come said jerry

  slim stared at him open-mouthed
say he exclaimed when dawson
sees where youre runnin this line
hell go loco i dont aim to get shot
up

  then jump your horse an high-tail
it for the ranch advised jerry

  heck i cant leave you here mut-
tered slim the bossd give me hell
if i did come on

  jerry waved his hand and went back
to his instrument

  say exploded slim you dont
know this dawson

  jerry grinned thats where youre
wrong slim i sure do know him
not knowing what to make of that
slim stared at jerry he scratched his
chin meanwhile glancing up toward
the bluff where he had seen dawson
and his riders

  youre runnin this line jest where
jim custer claims it oughta be he
the valley of dispute



muttered which means dawsonll be
out for your scalp if he bought you
off how come you aint doin what
he wanted done

  slim was asking the question of
himself having been told by jim cus-
ter to keep a close watch on jerry
if the surveyor-deputy heard it he
gave no sign he was busily at work
when dawson followed by three men
rode into the valley

  as before dawson greeted him cor-
dially but jerry saw that his com-
panions were hard-faced scowling and
heavily armed in reply to dawsons
questions he indicated where the
boundary line would run dawson
uttered an exclamation of surprise
and asked more questions jerry re-
plied crisply

  so youre sidin with custer
dawson demanded his ingratiating
manner suddenly leaving him him
an his gal fixed you huh

  he took a step toward jerry his
right hand stiff above his gun out
of the corner of his eye jerry saw
his three companions circle in some-
where behind him if he hadnt fled
was slim

  when jerry stone replied to daw-
son he looked him in the eye he was
smiling

  im runnin the line where it be-
longs it aint a question of sidin
with anybody custer jest happens to
be right you tried to bribe me he
didnt but thats beside the point
heres the line and here she goes
he lowered his voice and added so
that only dawson could hear si
senor gringo dawes

  if dawson had intended to draw his
gun those few softly spoken words
astonished and surprised him it re-
quired a full moment for them to sink
into his mind and in that moment he
saw a flashing series of pictures from
his own past

  jerry before had seen those pic-
tures gringo dawes the terror of
border towns riding his chestnut
arabian robbing and killing at the

head of his band of assorted ruffians
gringo dawes in fights with sheriffs
and rangers riding rough-shod over
the officers of the law and then-
what jerry didnt know-gringo
dawes captured arrested wounded
jailed escaping only by chance and
the loyalty of one of his men now as
buck dawson he was the boss of the
circle four but unable to run straight
playing his old game of taking what
he wanted by force

  jerrys words brought to him the
realization that he was known jerry
like the others he had fought and killed
was an officer of the lav expres-
sions of fear anger and cunning
crossed his heavy dark face his stiff-
fingered hand moved downward

  but jerry watching him closely
stepped quickly forward his gun flash-
ing in his hand the barrel of it sink-
ing into dawsons paunch with his
left hand he snatched dawsons gun
from its holster flung it aside as the
others hand closed on his wrist

  over dawsons shoulder jerry saw
the three circle four men dismount-
ing edging forward

  stay where you are he command-
ed or ill finish dawson youre
wanted gringo im arrestin you
they stood quite still dawson
clutching jerrys wrist jerrys gun
against his body the other men had
halted where slim was jerry didnt
know

  circle round dawson called to
his men get in back of him an
grab him

  you do laughed jerry an ill
kill this hombre the reward notices
say dead or alive gringo-you
oughta know that

  dawson did not lack courage with
a savage growl of rage he jerked at
jerrys arm exerting the full strength
of his heavy body and swung aside
his left arm sweeping down to knock
the gun from jerrys hand the gun
roared and the bullet grazed dawsons
side as he swung as jerry was off
balance and a little apart from daw-


ranch romances

son one of the circle four men fired
hot lead tore through jerrys shoul-
der in self-protection he closed with
dawson attacking savagely bearing
him to the ground dawson yelled to
his comrades and they ran toward the
fighting men

 jerry heard the roar of sixguns
and then with a feeling of relief slim
purdues steady voice

  stand back you jaspers said slim

 amid the deafening roar as he
fought with dawson jerry heard the
crack of a rifle then he saw that
dawson had recovered his own gun
and was bringing it down toward his
head he swung aside wrenching his
wounded shoulder and with a pain-
stiffened finger pulled the trigger of
his forty-four dawsons gun crashed
against his skull and a great weight
descended upon him

  that was all jerry knew until he
felt gentle arms encircling his neck
and felt hot tears upon his cheek
then he heard slim purdues voice

  i reckon hes cornin to he sure
finished dawson or dawes or what-
ever his name was an them others-
say when you opened up with the
rifle they must a thought a hull army
had dropped down on em only you
shouldnt a come here maam-it was
plumb crazy 

  jerry heard a choked sob and softly
spoken words

  i came to spy on him thinking he
had sold out to dawson i didnt trust
him i might have known-i did know
that he was honest and square but
i let stan vail-

  vail said slim disgustedly you
cant believe him on a stack of bibles
jerry wanted to tell anne not to
cry but it was some time before his
brain cleared and he could sit up he
found anne beside him and he patted
her arm

  she said something about forgive-
ness and he smiled at her he saw her
own radiant smile and he sighed her
tear-wet cheek was against his and she
kissed him

  heck observed slim we oughta
be ridin home

  slim rode on ahead and reported to
jim custer the details of what had hap-
pened

  yeah he concluded an youre
goin to get a son-in-law out of this
deal

  not stan vail

  slim waved his hand disdainfully
him lord no this surveyor-
deputy they plumb forgot i was
with em billin an cooin like theyd
discovered a new world

  and they had
 phantom gunman

by john johnson

there was only one person who could bring law to sterling county and they said
he was dead yet someone some strange illusive gunman entered the ranks of
justice to wreak vengeance for the death of an honest man

girl

ing from jim cranford

  the corrupt postmaster of sterling
could not meet grace lees wide vio-
let eyes nothin maam he lied

  she sighed and went away a shad-
ow over her fine-featured lovely face
the postmaster stuck a postcard in
his pocket and hurried over to the
diamond saloon

three men were playing cards at a
table sterling knew and feared them

as the big three the postmaster
handed the postcard to crease wal-
den who read

    dear grace

at this announcement capper munn
and sheriff sid lucas started jim

stared at each other their set faces
reflecting the memories roused by that
name




ranch romances

  jim cranford had first won fame as
a super-gunman in the sterling coun-
ty range war two years before when
the cattlemen rose to fight the rustlers
who had so long oppressed them jim
was only twenty-two then and had
never shot at anything but tin cans
but when the struggle broke he turned
his guns from tin cans to men he
beat several professional killers to the
draw and led the cowmen to victory
in a dozen skirmishes elected sheriff
despite his youth he gathered a posse
of daredevils and rode up and down
the county till the last rustler had
been killed jailed or driven out

  when sterling county was at peace
again jims job was done he resigned
his office and took the south trail to
sonora with a herd from his fathers
ranch after delivering the cattle he
drifted on alone through mexico a
revolution suddenly flared up there
and jim seemed to drop out of sight
months passing with no word from
him

  meanwhile changes were taking
place back home crease walden a
crooked rancher got out of jail by
political wire-pulling returned to
sterling and had a talk with the new
sheriff at the diamond saloon sheriff
lucas had been one of cranfords
deputies but now he sold out his oath
of office and joined waldens plot

 capper munn boss rustler who had
fled from cranfords posse returned
when walden and lucas sent word
to him a swarm of gunmen accom-
panied him so the old days were back
in sterling county-open rustling
killing lawlessness old george cran-
ford jims father had tried to or-
ganize resistance as a result he was
shot from ambush one night his lands
and cattle taken oyer by the big
three	

  the small ranchers disorganized
and helpless lacked leadership to re-
store peace and law they had one
hope if only jim cranford comes
back

 crease walden broke the silence

dont let a word of this get out he
commanded tearing the postcard to
bits turn out the gang to guard all
trails and roads south of sterling to
watch for cranford

  thats it-weve got to get cran-
ford said capper hes the one man
that can beat us and he musnt get
away shoot him on sight and pour
lead into him till he stops kickin as
long as he lives hes dangerous
massive bull-like lucas shook his
head i worked for that hombre once
but ill fix his clock ill watch the
main trail myself

a tall lean rider came up the
southeast trail at dusk he had
a striking face a face of contradic-
tions-a friendly mouth above a stern
chin full round cheeks like a boy a
curved hawk-like nose and keen bold
dark eyes as he passed a nesters
cabin at the county line the old nester
cried jim cranford

  jim stopped to shake hands see
yuh later im in a hurry to see grace
and dad he said in his deep mellow
voice

  then yuh aint heard jim asked
the nester didnt yuh get any of our
letters

  why no anyway there wouldnt
be any news to hear with everything
okay here i got caught in that revo-
lution saw lots of fightin and hard
ridin with the federalistas and my
mail never caught up with me jim
sighed been gone seven months
breeze ive seen lots of things and
had a great time but its best of all
to get home again well so long
he said and started away

  the nester grasped jims arm say-
ing hoarsely wait

  jim saw the sorrow in the old mans
eyes there aint anything wrong is
there a chill went through him
what is it pronto-tell me

  the nester told him at the news
of his fathers murder jim seemed
stunned for a moment then he went
nearly mad with grief and rage cry-
phantom gunman



ing the rotten killers ill show
them he spun the cylinders of his
two guns and ran to his horse

  what yuh goin to do jim

  im goin to sterling and tear it
apart till i get the truth shouted
jim then ill smoke down those
killers one by one dad ill get them
for yuh

  wait cried the nester go slow
even the sheriffs with them yuh
cant go alone against em all theyll
kill yuh before yuh start wait but
jim was already racing north his dark
eyes blazing and his face a granite
mask

  a wisp of a moon rose above the
horizon as he rode madly on as the
trail swung to the right to follow a
canyon rim four men rose from cover
with levelled guns and fired

  a shot grazed jims bronc and the
animal swerved off the trail toward
the precipice a huge man was draw-
ing a bead on jims heart jim spurred
and swung the bronc with all his
force the beast reared wildly on its
hind legs at the very canyon edge
and stopped the bullet meant for the
rider

  the stricken horse screamed and
tottered on the brink jim flung him-
self clear of the saddle but the leap
landed him on the treacherous rock
of the canyon rim the huge man
carne up for another shot and jim
recognized him lucas cried jim
yuh rat ill get yuh he reached
for his gun then the crumbled rock
under his feet gave way even as his
bronc collapsed a few feet away

  man and horse fell into the black
depths of the canyon at the same in-
stant seconds later there was a series
of thuds as of bodies ricocheting
down the rocks-then a splash and
silence

  lucas grinned lets go to town
was all he said

  the next day they found the bronc
and jims gun at the spot where he
had been ambushed and his hat a mile
down the river of the body there

was no trace he must of washed on
downstream further they agreed

  returning to town lucas exhibited
the hat and gun and announced that
jim cranford had been shot resisting
arrest a shudder of despair went over
sterling county cranford was gone
what hope was left now

grace lee went about dressed in
black now but somehow she
could not fully believe that jim cran-
ford was dead jim had loved her and
she loved him there would never be
anyone else wait for me grace
he had said and she was still waiting
she could not accept the grim facts
could not tear the hope out of her
heart

  sid lucas joined her one day as she
was walking down the street

  hello she said she hated the
man when jim was home lucas had
never dared speak to her had merely
followed her hungrily with his eyes
now however he was smirking bold
half possessive but she did not dare
turn him away for her fathers sake
old lee had quavered better be
civil to lucas grace hes threatened
me weve got to be on the good side
of him

  lucas was explaining that his men
watching for a bandit had shot cran-
ford in the darkness by mistake i
hope yuh dont hold it against me
he added we oughta be good friends
im a good friend to have and a bad
enemy grace he grasped her arm
possessively ill be seein yuh to-
night

  her heart felt like lead i suppose
so she said dully

  many strangers mostly crooks and
badmen flocked into sterling in the
following months there was scar
norwalk a rustler from the white
mountains who came with several
friends things had become too hot
for him in his old haunts so he fled
to sterling for refuge saw that the
pickings were good here and decided
to locate


ranch romances

  charlie thomas agent for an un-
scrupulous eastern packer came to
establish connections and buy cheap
beef from the local rustlers loud
flashily dressed a show-off he was
quickly attracted to grace and sought
her company constantly

  the rosarios notorious bandits from
old mexico passed through sterling
they were two brothers jose and
miguel swarthy and sinister their
shoe-button eyes darting everywhere
walden approached them with an offer
to join his gang but they refused no
senor said jose we play what you
call-lone hand they loaded two
pack horses with supplies and rode
out of town again

  there was also whisperin a ragged
vagrant who drifted into town one
morning and attached himself to the
diamond saloon he was young his
regular even-featured thin-lipped face
with its faint scar lines seemed strong
but sterling soon found he was no
good he spoke only in a husky whis-
per his weak eyes were covered by
tinted glasses and he seemed a coward
he did not carry a gun and at the
challenges and insults of toughs he
simply shook his head and walked
away

  he became general roustabout at the
diamond saloon ran errands cleaned
up took an occasional shift at tending
bar the patrons scornfully ignored
him men drank and quarreled and
gambled outlaws held whispered con-
ferences over future crimes mean-
while silent as ever whisperin would
come to their very elbows wielding
his broom and they would continue
as though he were not there he was
harmless despised

  one evening the cattle buyer came
to the diamond saloon and bought
the house for the night treating all
who came to unlimited free drinks to
gain good will for his company un-
restrained drunkenness followed oc-
casionally someone shot at whisper-
ins feet to make him jump a dozen
quarrels broke out

  crease walden and scar norwalk
were in one corner shouting at each
other theres plenty of room for
both of us workin this territory
roared the white mountain rustler
either you cut me in or ill force
my way in walden

  walden cursed the other savagely
a walden tough named stark stepped
in and struck norwalk in the mouth
capper interfered and restored peace

  a group of gunmen boasted of their
killings joining them stark drew his
gun and pointed out the four notches
on the butt

  someone said  bout time yore
addin that fifth stark-the one for
old cran-

  shut up yuh fool snarled stark
the other laughed drunkenly aw
be yoreself yore among friends aint
yuh we all know yuh had a hand in
that and theres nothin to worry
about now the cubs gone

  the crowd broke up late

the next morning an early riser
noticed a paper pinned to the
sheriffs bulletin board that had not
been there the night before it was
printed in pencil and read

warning

         to joe stark
            bill loring
            monk ferrel
            capper munn
            sid lucas
            crease walden

  the murder of my father will be avenged

jim cranford

  starks name had been crossed out
soon a group gathered about the
bulletin board talking excitedly some-
one roused the sheriff lucas came
out sleepy and sullen from a hang-
over

  whats up

  look-that note

  lucas read and laughed he tore
down the paper bunk some fool
practical joker cranfords dead
phantom gunman



  starks name was crossed out said
a cowboy

 well what of it you dont
think- lucas began and then
shrugged okay ill go see him but
he wont thank me for wakin him at
this hour

  joe stark was beyond waking they
found him in his hotel room on the
floor dead his face was contorted
with horror an unfired gun was in
his hand and three bullets in his chest

  at noon grace lee and lafe jen-
nings chanced to meet in front of the
general store lafe had been the cran-
fords trusted foreman he worked for
walden now with stifled hate in his
heart

  grace asked breathlessly lafe
youve heard do you think jim is
really alive

  i wouldnt build up any hopes
grace said lafe gently some
drunken fool fixed that note why
wasnt it written instead of printed
so that those of us who know jims
handwritin could really know
maybe thats it maybe he doesnt
want anyone to be sure just yet sug-
gested grace

  lafe shook his head

  whisperin came by tipping his hat
to grace she nodded absently as he
passed i think ill have to marry
lucas eventually she said dully id
sooner die but its for dads sake
she clenched her hands if jim would
only come

  if he only would echoed lafe
id follow him through the gates of
hell he shrugged said why talk
about impossible things and went on

  that afternoon the big three held
a conference in a quiet corner of the
diamond saloon

  whoever wrote that note put the
right names down began crease
spare and hawk-like

  the killer made that yellow stark
talk before he shot how else would
he know said lucas

  a hundred ways said crease we
shoulda done that job by ourselves

those three roughnecks talk when
theyre drunk everybodys got a
pretty good idea about old cranfords
finish but whats the note got to do
with starks killin anyway

  why its plain- lucas began
crease is right wizened little
capper interrupted the sheriff the
note was a drunkards fool joke it
wasnt written by the hombre who
plugged stark though the killer
mighta seen it and crossed out starks
name when he got through no weve
got to look elsewhere for that shootin
and my guess is scar norwalk
crease nodded thoughtfully my
idea too stark hit him at the party
and he got even he drummed on the
table his cold gray eyes narrow we
got to tend to that hombre give him
the works hes gettin too cocky
around here anyway tomorrow say
right said lucas raising his huge
bulk from his chair capper nodded

  funny nobody heard those shots
remarked capper

 thats easy laughed crease
everybody was pie-eyed except a few
hombres like whisperin here how
about it whisperin did yuh hear
anything

  whisperin kept on mopping as he
shook his head no

three of norwalks gang had
been bought off by capper the
rest of the out-of-town bunch includ-
ing the leader rode out to waldens
mountain cabin the next day with
crease the local rancher was genial
and hospitable promised the norwalk
crew a third share of the rustling
profits and circulated the bottles
freely

  suddenly crease excused himself
ducked outside and the next moment
a score of gunmen outlaws and depu-
ties intermingled rushed the cabin
from all sides it was more of a massa-
cre than a battle norwalk and his
three attendants were quickly dis-
posed of while the big three lost
only one man


ranch romances

  this grim lesson impressed all with
two points-dont horn into sterling
county dont harm anyone connected
with the big three

 the empty mockery of sterling
county law was gone through with
the victims were buried

  shortly after this a pair of masked
road agents began to work the trails
out of sterling robbing many travel-
ers they were vicious gunmen who
shot at the faintest show of resistance
some thought it was the rosarios

  meanwhile the eastern cattle buyer
offered poor prices so the big three
decided to continue sending their
stolen herds to mexico his dickering
over charlie thomas still lingered to
see grace lee he was a harmless
windbag and the girl found him more
tolerable than the brutal hulking
lucas but the sheriff flamed with
jealousy and ordered his deputy lor-
ing to break it up loring stopped
grace and thomas on the street sent
the girl on and beat the cattle buyers
face to a pulp

  the next night there was an after-
math it was late the saloon was clos-
ing up and crease and lucas stood
talking near the front door nearly
everyone had gone home long ago
and the dark street was deserted

  loring passed the two saying good
night the next moment crease grew
rigid and seized his companions arm
look-out there

  the windovs of the saloon threw
great rectangles of yellow light across
the blackness of the street outside
loring stood in the farthest of these
rectangles staring into the night be-
yond he was a picture of stark terror
beneath a face gone sickly gray his
jaw dropped his hands hung limp at
his sides for the space of three
breaths he stood so then his right
hand clawed at his gun cleared the
holster two red flashes stabbed at
him out of the darkness with a roar
and loring fell without firing

  come on shouted crease he and
lucas raced outside quickly they

bent over loring but he was already
dead they looked up and down the
street there was no one to be seen
and no sound but the chirping o
crickets

  the pair ran back into the saloon
murder turn out pronto shouted
crease to the bartender and the re-
maining patrons this way sid out
the back door hell be gettin away
up the alley

  as they rushed through the back
room lucas bumped against someone
cursed and whipped out his gun
crease cried sharply whos that
lucas grunted disgustedly as he
peered into an even-featured dark-
spectacled face heard a whispered ex-
planation about hunting that extra
case of bourbon hell its only
whisperin come on they went on
into the alley raced in opposite direc-
tions found nothing

  but a single idea filled lucas heavy
one-track brain seething with red
fury he went on and burst into
charlie thomas cabin to find thomas
reading there alone

  whats wrong sheriff

  never figgered yuhd have the guts
to shoot it out with loring gritted
lucas now lets see yuh shoot it out
with lorings boss

  for gosh sake lucas cried the
cattle buyer frantically i dont know
what youre talkin about my gun
aint been fired for weeks look and
see

  get up and take it coyote roared
lucas he cursed and goaded the
terror-stricken man and at last thomas
rose and made his play lucas beat
him to the draw easily and shot him
down thomas gun discharging harm-
lessly as it fell

  on the way back to the saloon the
sheriff halted abruptly at his bulletin
board and struck a match there was
what he had feared to find-a fresh
duplicate of the cranford note only
on this copy lorings name had also
been crossed out i will avenge my
fathers death lucas read aloud
phantom gunman



slowly his fury evaporated and
changed to fear

  a sleepy crowd began to gather
whats all the shootin asked some-
one

  nothin i cant handle shouted
lucas go back to bed

  that was the beginning of uneasi-
ness in the big three spread monk
ferrel who stood third on that kill-
ers list went about with guns and
nerves at hairtrigger tension capper
munn threw guards about the town to
stop everyone after nightfall and put
ferrel in charge of things generally

  crease walden jeered foolishness
norwalk drilled stark the buyer got
loring and we got both of them the
papers from the same fool joker
stark and loring bein in on the
cranford killin with us is just a co-
incidence

  coincidence hell growled ferret-
like capper that paper was posted
two minutes after loring died-and
his name was crossed off i tell yuh
theres somebody after us a sort of
phantom gunman-jim cranford or
somebody posin as him

  not jim cranford damn yuh
shouted lucas in swift fury i saw
him die

  keep yore head sid advised
crease if yuh hadnt flew off the
handle and gunned thomas so quick
we mighta checked him up

  whoever it is we got to get him
or hell get us finished capper and
im watchin every bet

  capper had spies out through the
county he even sent men to track
down the road agents election day
was drawing near with the sheriffs
office falling vacant capper sent for
the candidate opposing lucas a griz-
zled nester and spoke very forcefully
the nester withdrew from the run-
ning unopposed for the office lucas
would have a walkaway

  capper also sent for lafe jennings
yuh used to come to town once a
month now its every day or so
whats the idea

  maybe fer a look at the tall build-
ings replied lafe airily

  can the wisecracks puncher
snarled capper weve got no use for
yuh take a tip and stay out of sterl-
ing from now on the old cranford
ex-foreman had to obey

  capper overlooked no possibility
he even wrote to a nation-wide detec-
tive agency enclosing a check and an
old photograph of jim cranford
meanwhile crease scoffed and lucas
was busy elsewhere with grace lee

  three days before election lucas
swaggered into the saloon cuffed
whisperin good humoredly slapped
ferrel on the back and cried to the
bartender to set up the house crease
understood the reason for this out-
burst he had seen lucas kiss grace
publicly in parting watched her walk
away now tight-lipped her head held
high grace had agreed to marry
lucas

  does she love yuh fer yore looks
or yore disposition drawled capper

  she hates me i reckon lucas
drank and laughed but shes marryin
me just the same his brutal face
was aglow with wolfish triumph
thats why i drygulched cranford
thats why i throwed in with yuh-to
get her and fer the girl id do it
again phantom and all

  that night the phantom struck again

at midnight ferrel started out
to inspect the outposts he
walked from the diamond saloon
toward the southern edge of town-a
distance of three hundred yards with
guards stationed at both places there
was only starlight ferrel had gone
down the dark street about halfway
when shots rang out-then a cry

  they found ferrel stretched in the
roadway his unfired gun in his hand
his animal-like face was ghastly but
he was not yet dead he seized
creases arm with a convulsive grip
and gasped cranford its jim cran-
ford

it was too dark there to discern


ranch romances

faces one could see oniy the outline
of mens bodies black against the
starry night it couldnt a been
cranford said crease yuh couldnt
a seen him clear enough to know
but i heard his voice i knew jim
cranford for years i couldnt be
wrong  on that    blood gushed
to ferrels lips crease wiped it away
and ferrel went on jim said hello
ferrel and i stopped he said turn
around rat im givin yuh a chance
like yuh didnt give my dad make
yore play then- ferrel broke off
and laughed crazily

  its jim cranford back from the
dead he continued again he came
back to get me-to get yuh all

  it was a few minutes later that two
men carried the dying killer away

  lucas had struck a match picked
up something now from beside the
spot where ferrel had lain the big
three gathered close to stare at the
scrap of paper terrels name crossed
off whispered lucas

  coincidence crease drawled cap-
per

  crease shook his head stark lor-
ing ferrel gone oniy us three left
now

  blow out that match barked cap-
per want him to pot-shoot us
lucas said he dont work that
way hell shoot it out with us like
he did with the others he stared
into the night added in a strange
hoarse voice maybe it is jim cran-
ford who else could throw a gun like
that

  come on are we goin to take this
sittin still snap out of it snarled
capper call out every man were
movin against this hombre pronto
with all weve got pick yoreselves a
spot me im searchin sterling from
top to bottom maybe he aint out of
town yet

 ill go out and nab them road
agents lucas had caught fire from
cappers example maybe theyre the
ones any shot in the darks worth
tryin

  ill take half the gang and comb

the ranges said crease lets go

  though there was furious activity
that night the searchers were handi-
capped by the fact that they did not
know just whom they were looking
for capper ransacked sterling and
found nothing using secret informa-
tion and a decoy lucas trapped the
pair of road agents and shot them to
death unmasked the bodies proved to
be those of the rosario brothers as
had been expected

  creases party accomplished nothing
for all their hard riding and question-
ing of sleepy cowmen but as the next
day dawned they found crudely let-
tered placards scattered everywhere
nailed to trees and fence posts say-
ing vote for jim cranford for
sheriff

  crease cursed like a madman when
he saw that his men destroyed all
the signs they came across but enough
remained for ail of sterling county
to read

  a strange stirring ran through the
region like a hidden wave almost
every voter went to the polls per-
haps they were moved by remem-
brance or by blind hope that persisted
in spite of facts perhaps it was simply
a cynical secret protest against things
as they were a preference for a dead
honest man over a live scoundrel at
any rate they cast their ballots in
a strange way

  the election board was composed of
honest men chiefly because the big
three had never gone to the trouble
of replacing them late election night
the last vote counted the chairman of
the board announced the results

  jim cranford is elected sheriff by
a majority over sid lucas he wrote
though cranford was not a regular
candidate his name was written in by
the individual voters which is per-
fectly legal also though cranford is
reported killed on the best authority
yet he has not been legally declared
dead therefore his election stands

  lucas was made acting sheriff in
phantom gunman



cranfords absence if cranford did
not appear to take office within thirty
days then lucas as runner-up would
get the position by forfeiture

  old-timers shook their heads there
had been a reign of bloodshed and
terror and now the climax-a dead
man placed in the sheriffs chair few
noticed that those slain whether mem-
bers of the big three or their victims
were all scoundrels and criminals not
a single honest man had perished
since jim cranford

 there was nothing on the bulletin
board when lucas returned late from
seeing grace but several sleepless
hours later he went out into the dawn
and found this

at the diamond saloon-tonight at

  ten

sheriff jim cranford

 at this the big three assembled
lucas was fatalistic to his primitive
superstitious mind the ghost of his
victim was returning for vengeance
crease was bewildered could only
stare but capper was glad at last
the baffling search for an unknown
was over and the showdown near

 boys our phantom gunmans foot
has slipped at last this time hes
committed suicide capper cried

 what dyuh mean asked crease

 hes always done what he said he
would aint he capper replied
never disappointed us and he wont
disappoint us now come hell or high
water he aims to be at the saloon at
ten tonight well well be ready for
him

 warn everybody to stay at home
surround the saloon with torches and
bonfires light up the ground so a
mouse cant cross without bein seen
plant all our men in ambush with
orders to shoot to kill everyone who
comes then whether the phantom
travels alone or with a crowd tonight
let him come

 but the thingll spread around
hes bound to hear and stay away
protested crease

  hell hear but hell come anyway
laughed capper the way i figger
this mysterious hombre its a matter
of pride with him never to go back
on his word to us hes plumb locoed
thataway sid yuhll see hes real
enough and no ghost well wait in
the saloon if he gets past the gang
alive which a million to one he wont
we might get the chance to throw lead
into him crease

  crease his hawk face agleam smiled
cruelly

nine oclock a dark cloudy night
all was ready the trap set the
big three waited in the diamond
saloon playing stud half a dozen
loungers whose curiosity was greater
than their fear were there also

  fill em up again shouted lucas
come on wheres that bottle

  he lurched toward the bar and col-
lided heavily with whisperin with
a snarl he struck the roustabout and
sent him sprawling whisperin picked
himself up his face expressionless
and went on mopping the floor

  the three snarled at each other over
their game and watched the hands of
the clock creep around

  lucas said ferrel heard cranfords
voice

  nothin to it scoffed crease
dyin men get locoed notions some-
times wonder who it really is and
whats his game this fake cranford
ive stopped thinkin about that
ansvered capper we bumped off
norwalk and thomas and the rosarios
on the chance that one of them was
our man and we were wrong now
ferget it and wait soon well know
weve done a lot of killin said
lucas the cranfords young and
old-

  stop harpin on that yuh block-
head barked crease

  heres yore mail capper said the
bartender its been layin here since
mornin impatiently capper waved
him away

 the bartender watched him how


ranch romances

strange that this hard desperate trio
who with their gang had terrorized
the entire country should themselves
be terrorized in turn by one man

  now the time was growing short
and the three threw down their cards
and lined up against the bar facing
the front door guns ready crease
peered out through a crack in the win-
dow shade the fires made it as bright
as day outside the gang crouched
ready whisperin finished his task
and went into the back room the bar-
tender stopped polishing the bar ex-
cept for the hoarse breathing of the
men and the tick of the clock there
was no sound in the room it was
nearly ten

  creases laugh grated in the silence
hell were a pack of fools he
wont come how could he come
the clock struck-ten measured
clanging strokes all eyes in the room
stared at it as though fascinated as
the last stroke died away there was
a breath of air the ghost of a sound
they all spun around as one man

  at the back room door stood whis-
perin his even-featured face was
tense and hard his tinted glasses
were off and for the first time they
really noticed his eyes-dark keen
blazing there were two gunbelts
about his waist now his hands tensed
above the gun butts he spoke in a
deep mellow voice that filled the
room

  make yore play

  it was a voice they all knew beyond
any doubt-the voice of jim cranford
the big three stared

  this thing could not be jim cran-
ford whom they had slain could not
be alive yet the man with the familiar
face of whisperin had jim cranfords
eyes jim cranfords voice again he
was talking in tones that rang as
hard as iron make yore play yuh
murderin coyotes im jim cranford
crease made the first break lurch-
ing sideways as he clawed for his
holster jim cranfords guns seemed
to leap from their holsters like twin

striking snakes and roared waldens
death song

  capper was next in the line he
cleared leather but before he could
level his weapon two slugs caught
him in the chest and he died without
firing then lucas-in the fraction of
a second that had elapsed he had time
to draw but just as he pulled trigger
cranford shot and lucas convulsive
grip sent his bullet wild lucas held
himself erect with an arm across the
bar and fired again cranford jerked
and steadied returned the fire with
both guns and lucas went down

  wisps of acrid gunsmoke curled
upward cranford turned his blazing
eyes on the bystanders as he waved
them away from the door they scut-
tled like sheep into a far corner
huddled there harmlessly outside the
gang amazed at the outburst of gun-
fire in their midst came from their
hiding places and gathered at the
front door

  there were shouts of capper
lucas whats wrong in there

  a gunman opened the door stared
for a moment at the scene within at
his leaders stretched on the floor
with a gasp he reached toward his
hip but cranford guns levelled at his
heart cried leave it there the
mans fingers jerked away from his
gun butt as though the touch burned
him and he slammed the door to

  jim cranford took the nickeled star
off lucas shirt and pinned it to his
own in the name of the law throw
down yore guns he cried he levelled
his guns at the closed door ready for
a rush outside the leaderless ruffians
whispered together uncertain

  suddenly a swarm of men swept out
of the night upon them a warning
shot went over their heads a cry rang
out throw em up pronto the
tables were turned the gangsters had
been drawn from their hiding places
now stood outlined in the light of
their own fires two or three resisted
and were shot down the rest of them
surrendered without a struggle
phantom gunman



  lafe jennings burst into the saloon
and at the sight of him jim grinned
and put his guns away the two com-
pared watches we came about twenty
seconds late said lafe

  close enough laughed jim

  yore bleedin boy cried the old
ex-foreman

  a scratch bullet raked my ribs
said jim he took a glass of whiskey
from the trembling bartender and
dashed it on the wound stay here in
charge lafe ill tend to the rest

 as jim started away lucas opened
his eyes and called faintly jim went
to the ex-sheriffs side he stooped
down and lucas ran exploring fingers
over his arm dont savvy this but
reckon    yore real jim mind shak-
in hands

 jim pressed the hand in silence
reckon yuh win everything    girl
and all said lucas well id  do
it    all over again his breathing
rattled then his defiant grin became
fixed and his head fell back

 jim laid the body down and went
outside he gave orders to lafes men
sent part of them to lock up the
prisoners gradually the group dis-
persed and jim was left alone beside
a glaring bonfire

  then a slim white-clad figure came
out of the darkness toward him it
was grace lee who had been waiting
she approached slowly peering at his
face-at his straight nose and flat
cheeks and thin lips and the fine scar
lines at the edge of his jaw a de-
spairing sob burst from her quivering
lips no no it cant be as she came
a step closer and he faced toward the
fire suddenly her violet eyes bright-
ened she gasped jim cranfords
eyes wrhy-

  jim asked in his deep mellow voice
grace dont you know me

 the next moment grace was in his
arms her arms about his neck jim
jim youve come back i thought you
were dead

  jim held her close come he said
gently ill take yuh home

 meanwhile at the saloon the bodies
had been taken away and lafe with
several men stood guard outside the
loungers gathered at the bar talking
excitedly how could that be jim
cranford cranford didnt look any-
thing like this hombre

  the bartender said heres cappers
mail hell never need it now he
opened the envelopes to find a couple
of circulars then at the sight of a
letter he stiffened get this boys
he cried while the others closed
around

 report on james cranford

 dear mr munn

    we finally traced james cranford to
  the mountain city hospital he arrived
  there last april suffering from several
  broken ribs and a broken arm his face
  terribly smashed and infected he ex-
  plained he had fallen over a cliff landing
  by chance on a ledge part way down the
  side which saved his life afterwards
  he had drifted downstream on a raft
  until rescued by cowboys

   after cranford was out of danger
  several operations were performed on
  his face plastic surgery being used to
  remedy his disfigurement it was highly
  successful when the plastic surgery
  was finished cranford had a new face
  -even well proportioned features in
  place of his former irregular ones and
  only a few very faint scars showed

    after a four-month stay when cran-
  ford was about to leave the hospital
  he asked the chief surgeon would
  folks who knew me all my life ever
  recognize me now

  not a chance declared the surgeon
  well see said cranford as he went
  away we believe that cranford posing
  as a stranger is now in your very midst
  unrecognized

   we enclose a photograph from the
  hospital records of james cranford as
  he appears now

                       respectfully
  standard detective agency

 the bartender laid down the letter
that had been read too late and stared
at the photograph so the whisperin
roustabout ive been orderin around
was really jim cranford

the next night grace and jim were
on the lee ranch house porch
under the moon after that plastic
surgery i couldnt be recognized ex-

cept by my eyes and my voice so i
used dark glasses and a fake whisper
to fix that said jim i came back
to get even for dads death-hung
around the saloon until i got a clue
then i cornered stark alone forced
him to tell who the others were then
beat him to the draw afterward i
went after the others one by one in
a fair fight soon as the shooting was
over i put my gunbelt under my shirt
and ducked the gang saw me said
its only whisperin and rushed on
by to find the killer

  i put lafe jennings wise and he
got together some close-mouthed men
he could trust after that strange
election i had official standin lafes
boys were ready and it was time to
come out in the open for the show-
down i reckon thats all

  but why didnt you tell me you
were here-alive asked grace

  i couldnt i had a big job to do

yuhd have worried even more better
for yuh not to know till it was over
he sighed well its over now dad
can rest easy in his grave

  yes thats ended said grace
when yuh didnt recognize me i
had a strange feelin as if id lost
yuh said jim does it matter to
yuh my face bein changed do yuh
feel that im a stranger

 she looked at him smiling you
look better than before jim but ap-
pearance doesnt matter anyway i
know that inside youre the same jim
cranford ive always known

  then somethin new is just begin-
nin said jim the hard lines had
faded out of his face his dark eyes
were soft adoring gently he drew her
toward him i mean our life together
grace ive always loved yuh-if yuhll
have me

  wordless she raised her radiant
face to his

to cook or not to cook that was the question such a predicament faced brady wilson
brorc-buster par excellence when all the time he longed to perform some heroic act that
would enable him to cut a figure in the eyes of pretty doreen

rady wilson drew in his
horse at the crest of a ridge
about a mile out of town to gaze
down into the valley at the
cluster c- houses and stores with the
railroad loading chutes and corrals
which comprised baxter then he
turned in the saddle for a sweeping
look over the surrounding country

  this range sure suits me he mused
aloud next thing is to find some out-
fit thats looking for a first-class cow-
puncher

  grinning at his own conceit he dis-
played a double row of white even
teeth his gray eyes twinkled while
tiny lines radiating from their corners
betrayed a sense of humor

-ranch romances-first sept

  brady had drifted up from arizona
with the determination to locate him-
self somewhere in western colorado a
section which had always appealed to
him but a weeks search discovered
no outfit in need of his services while
an unlucky session of poker had made it
imperative that he connect with some
paying occupation within a few hours

  horse saddle and equipment were of
the best which would assure any dis-
cerning eye that brady wilson was a
good hand an asset to any ranch
payroll however luck was against
him for there happened at that time to
be an oversupply of first-class cow-
punchers in that section

  he rode slowly into town to dis-


ranch romances

mount in front of the general store as
he looped one rein about the hitch-rail
the screen door at the top of the steps
was pushed open and held by a cowboy
whose face was wreathed with smiles
as he bowed awkwardly to the girl who
emerged several parcels in her arms

  thanks bud she said her voice
like the unexpected chiming of a silver
bell on clear morning air

  already bradys glance was unobtru-
sively enveloping her not a contour of
her lovely features and graceful figure
escaping his eye soft tendrils of brown
hair with bronze high-lights evaded the
confinement of her straw hat the brim
of which was cleverly turned back to
frame the sweet oval of her face

  thick lashes exactly matching the
curls which caressed her forehead and
half concealed the pink-lobed ears
fringed eyes of so brilliant a blue that
brady could think of nothing in the
world to match them her whole being
radiated daintiness the clear skin just
lightly touched with tan the hands that
were graceful and dimpled without be-
ing too small the high-arched feet

  as she descended the steps her
glance passed lightly over brady
meeting his eyes for just an instant to
leave him with a breathless helpless
feeling the cowboy she had called
bud was already clattering down the
steps to follow her to an automobile
standing at the end of the hitch-rack
he opened the car door giving clumsy
assistance with the parcels but his only
words were good-by doreen as she
drove away

  not until girl and car disappeared
around a corner did brady wilson re-
cover his powers of locomotion suffi-
ciently to mount the steps and pursue
his original intention of entering the
store to make some inquiries

  doreen he exclaimed under his
breath sounds as pretty as she looks
ill sure stay around here if i have to
hold some rancher up for a job

  abel barnes was more than willing
to dispense information while he
weighed out sugar and wrapped parcels

for the group around the counter but
he shook his head lugubriously at
bradys questions

  aint heard of anyone wantin a
cowpuncher he wheezed peering
sharply at brady from little eyes al-
most smothered with fat but here
comes jordan gates-hes foreman for
the cross bar over temeech way-
hell know if any of them ranchers are
short a hand

  brady wilson didnt care for the ap-
pearance of the slender self-assured
fellow who pushed open the screen
door with the manner of one who ex-
pects to command instant attention
from all and sundry he favored brady
with a supercilious glance turning
back to give him a cool stare as the
storekeeper put a question

  no gates drawled there isnt
much demand around here for drifting
cowpunchers there was almost a
sneer in the words

  straight and steady bradys gray
eyes looked into the greenish ones set
in the narrow closely shaven face of
the cross bar foreman then without
comment he swung around to a man
standing nearby to engage him in a dis-
cussion of the surrounding country
instantly jordan gates betrayed hostil-
ity the manner of the stranger had
too openly disregarded him scorned
his importance any retort would have
been less exasperating than this calm
ignoring of his presence

  the antagonism between the two men
was mutual with this difference-
brady wilson actually dismissed gates
from his thoughts but the latter held a
rancor so lively that it demanded some
outlet

  since it was saturday a number of
ranchers were in tcwn but none was
in need of a rider as he strolled about
brady again encountered the cowboy
he had first seen on the steps of the
store from him by diplomatic ques-
tions was extracted the information
that the girl who had driven off in the
car was doreen landis that was all
brady was too sensitive to his own
show em cowboy



sudden interest in her to push his in-
quiries further

  near the end of the afternoon it be-
came a question as to whether there
was any job in the entire neighborhood
open to a cowpuncher but as brady
wilsons need increased so with each
advancing hour did his determination
become greater he would not leave the
section of country that was home to
doreen landis finally as he strolled
towards the post office thinking he
might encounter someone else from out
of town the storekeeper beckoned
from his doorway

  hey came in barnes wheezy voice
hey young feller i just heard of
something if youre right set on a
ranch job

  sure am brady answered turning
to mount the steps

  abel barnes surveyed him for a mo-
ment with pursed lips we-ell he
said slowly gates was just in here on
his way home and hed heard of a place
on the oliver ranch-the double o
they need a feller bad soons he can
et there one of their men broke
both his legs this mornin

  wilson nodded as he heard the name
of the outfit to work under jordan
gates would have been a pretty tough
proposition but he wondered why the
storekeeper regarded him with that
lurking doubt in his eyes probably
the double o was a hard outfit to work
for brady squared his shoulders

  thanks he said ill head right
that way he was thinking i can
stand it till i land something better
ive gotta stay till i get acquainted
with doreen landis those blue eyes
of hers have got all the magnets in the
world beat i couldnt ride away from
here nossir

  barnes gave explicit directions re-
garding the trail to the double o
just tell jude oliver youve come to
take hanks place he said again giv-
ing brady an odd close look he
seemed about to add something then
closed his lips tightly as if to imprison
the words

  anything the matter with olivers
outfit the cowboy ventured with a
humorous glance

  no no-nothing a-tall came the
quick denial judes the finest hombre
hereabouts couldnt tie to a better
boss

  humph brady ejaculated as he
turned away from the store he
thought theres something queer
about the whole deal vonder what
it is

  but he headed at once for the double
o it would take brisk riding to reach
the ranch before dark and he had the
urge of an empty stomach as he rode
from town he reflected that doreen
landis had turned in that same direc-
tion when she drove off in the morning
which offered hope that she might live
somewhere in the neighborhood of the
oliver outfit

  the sun was just vanishing below
the peak of an upthrust mountain
leaving a golden glory diffused over
the sky when he turned from the high-
way to follow a grassy road towards
the ranch buildings a half mile distant
the nearer he came the more pleasant
and well kept the place appeared be-
sids the spacious ranch house his ob-
servant gaze located a roomy bunk-
house numerous neat outbuildings and
several pole corrals

  brady smiled already he was aware
of a comfortable home-like feeling
looks good to me he decided the
next thing is to find doreen

  voices came from the bunkhouse it
seemed supper must be over but the
clear air bore the aroma of coffee hint-
ing that it was not too late for a warm
meal

  as brady approached the house a
heavy-shouldered man whose roughly
carved features indicated a character
of some force emerged from the door
he gave the cowboy a quick keen
glance

  brady reined in howdy he said
i guess you must be mr oliver-my
names brady wilson heard youre
looking for a man to replace someone


ranch romances

named hank that had an accident to-
day

  while he was speaking the cowboy
was aware that another man came to
the door halting there to speak to
someone inside the house only part
of his figure was visible but that was
strongly suggestive of the cross ear
foreman

  olivers eyes held a flicker of sur-
prise as they glanced over the strange
cowboys horse and equipment then
he said sure-mighty glad to see you
wilson didnt know what we were
going to do-not a man around that
could fill hanks place light and put
your horse in the corral

  before brady could reply the door
opened and gates emerged for the
second time that day his greenish eyes
flickered over the cowboy then he
drawled as he descended the steps
you said youd be glad to go to
work any place i didnt know then
about this job-but im sure it will just
suit you there was no particular ex-
pression in the tone yet brady felt an
implied sneer

  gates moved on across the yard to a
horse that was tied to a tree calling
back so long oliver-see you soon
so long the rancher returned
walking towards the corral at bradys
side theres a bunk in the cook
shack he went on and hank slept
there i guess theres everything youll
need to get breakfast in the morning
you can get whatever you need from
the storehouse-ill give you the key
brady thought his ears must be play-
ing him tricks before he could frame
a question however the rancher said
were up against it here without a
cook as my wife isnt well and my
niece has all she can do at the house
sure glad you came along

  brady wilson took a sudden dizzy-
ing mental somersault well ill be
damned he exclaimed to himself
theyve hired me for a cook and
its a put-up job of that mister fore-
man gates to humiliate me-humph
halting his stride he was on the point

of flat refusal when second thought re-
strained him

  i havent got a dime-and not an-
other thing in sight guess ill have
to stick and ill hand that hatchet-
faced fellow a surprise maybe he
wont get such a big laugh after all
theres one consolation-i can make
sourdough biscuits around nine-tenths
of the cooks i ever saw

  so brady wilson accepted the situa-
tion grinning ruefully to himself as he
spread his blankets in the former
cooks bunk he wondered what his
recent mates would think if they knew
of his predicament if ive got any
enemies theyd sure be tickled but
this aint gonna last moren a month
ill get my pay and pull out you cant
keep a good cowpuncher down im
still within ridin distance of doreen
when i get through wrastlin pots ill
look her up the first thing

  he was tired and with that soothing
thought brady fell into a slumber
which lasted so long he had to move at
double quick time to build the fire and
have breakfast for the five ravenous
punchers who stormed the cook shack
at break o day he was aware of their
sidelong looks of appraisal

  guess they sense i aint no ordinary
cook he grinned to himself but i
aint saying a word let em think
what they like-some of these days ill
show em a thing or two then they
can boast that theyre the only hombres
that ever was nourished by the culimuy
masterpieces of brady wilson top
cowpuncher of arizona and colorado
he smothered the urge that rose
within him as the mens spurs jingled
off towards the corrals ever since he
could remember morning had meant
mounting a horse to ride out over the
range for a few minutes he hated the
big iron stove in the corner wanted to
fling the pots and pans as far as he
could and run from the place there
was a sour note in his grin now as he
surveyed the remains of breakfast an-
ticipating with sudden keenness the
thirty other breakfasts he must prepare
show em cowboyj



before he could hit the trail with a
months pay in his pocket

  oppressed by this thought he moved
to the doorway throwing back his head
to inhale a revivifying breath of the
fresh morning air but he stopped
mouth open his entire body stiffening
as if from the impact of a sudden blow

  the doorway of the ranch house
kitchen opposite framed a vision of
radiant loveliness but brady wilson
would rather have faced an array of
forty-fives than the girl whose vivid
blue eyes flashed a glance across the
open space straight into his amazed
ones he believed there was a flash of
surprise over her face then her red lips
formed a slight smile a tantalizing
elusive smile and she turned back into
the house

  damn brady exclaimed aloud re-
treating hastily from sight how did
she get here    oh suddenly he
understood oliver had mentioned a
niece-doreen landis of course she
lived at the ranch-it was her home

  he experienced no thrill of delight
that he would be able to see her every
day instead not an inch of his six
feet of muscular slenderness but
blushed with the ignominy of his posi-
tion the bunkhouse cook could the
pride of a top-hand suffer keener
humiliation and was a cowboy ever
in a more exasperating predicament

  sight of the cook stove now pro-
duced positive nausea he would go
away at once but no-he couldnt to
leave now would be to cover himself
with greater indignity than to stick it
out for the month he originally in-
tended but even brady wilsons
humor could find no amusement in the
situation

  fear of encountering the girl kept
him within the shelter of the cook
house none of the men would be in
for dinner and he delayed until long
past the noon hour to go to the store
room not until he no longer heard
sounds of activity around the ranch
kitchen did he venture across the yard
then he moved quickly with furtive

glances over his shoulder as he
slipped the key into the padlock he
heard feminine voices issuing from an
upstairs window in the big house one
he recognized as belonging to doreen

  shes safe up there he thought
with a sigh of relief

  from the well-stocked shelves he
selected supplies to last a couple of
days glances at doreen from safe con-
cealment were preferable to personal
encounters while he labored under the
stigma of bunkhouse cook

  as he emerged from the storeroom
the afternoon breeze bore words from
that upstairs window straight to his
ears

  i thought he was a cowboy when x
saw him in baxter that morning came
in the girls clear sweet tones

  lots of fellows that arent any good
at cowpunching fall back on cooking
an older rather whining voice said
we had one once before that was a
fine cook but he was too lazy to be any
good on the range

  damn brady muttered his ears
reddening he quickened his steps
too he didnt want to hear doreens
reply to those comments no matter
what she said right then it would be
unendurable

  for some moments he cherished the
idea that he would set a supper before
the crew which would give every man
in the outfit indigestion in his present
mood their sufferings would bring
brady wilson positive enjoyment but
he repudiated that plan no lasting
balm for his pride could come from
such a course the only trail for him
to take was the one that led through
thirty days of cooking for the oliver
outfit after that hed show folks

  it was a relief when the men came
to supper they talked of range mat-
ters of the experiences of a hard day
working cattle on the rimrocks of a
hundred subjects that interested brady
momentarily he was able to forget that
his had been the ignominious task of
peeling the vegetables they ate with
such gusto


ranch romances

  youd oughta ve seen the way that
ornery black horse i was ridin turned
to buckin when i got out on rocky
point today a lathe-like cowboy
with carroty hair exclaimed he acted
like he was close kin to that roan devil
dynamite over to the cross bar
ha ha burst out the square-faced
straw boss an i spose he didnt spill
you none

  he did not youre laughin duffy
because you got im on my string
well he aint goin to pile me

  duffy grinned red sure thinks he
can ride he declared its a wonder
he dont go over to the cross bar and
try dynamite

  i have thought about it the cow-
boy asserted stoutly somebodys go-
ing to ride that roan sometime-might
as well be me and i could find plenty
of use for that five hundred simoleons
warner offers to the hombre that can
stay with the buckin roan devil
must be some horse brady ex-
claimed

  duffy nodded emphatically he is
worst one ever known around here
thad warners had him to a lot of
rodeos and nobodys ever rode him yet
thads a great gambler-loves a bet
hes offered five hundred dollars to any
cowpuncher that can ride -dynamite
slick and stay till he quits buckin
the straw boss tilted his cup to
drain the last drops of coffee then
turned back to brady wilson talk-
in of horses that sorrel you rode in
here looks as if hed be a pretty good
cow-horse

  hes the best cut-horse i ever saw
brady replied

  is that so duffys eyes sparkled
how about a little trade seems too
bad not to let him do his stuff

  ye-ah red put in you dont
need a cut-horse to pack you around
this reminder of his present status
among the group of cowboys nettled
brady my horse aint for sale he
said with finality

  it wasnt easy to hold his tongue and
accept the position so uncomfortably

thrust upon him but he knew it was
not the time for explanations if he
could manage to hold out for the
month he would be in a position to do
some laughing himself

  the next day brady contrived to
keep close within his quarters it
seemed to him that he never had seen
a girl so fond of walking out of doors
as was doreen he knew that she did
considerable work yet she was con-
tinually appearing in the yard and she
passed the cook house five times on
various trips to the corrals she seemed
to be much interested in the saddle
stock each time he saw her bradys
heart executed a new measure of syn-
copation never before had a girl so
affected him and the mere sight of
doreen landis plunged him into a
woeful state of bashfulness

  darn it he exclaimed if i had
a good horse under me an a rope in my
hand i wouldnt be scared none of
her

  for forty-eight hours he success-
fully evaded speech with the girl but
luck turned on the third day doreen
had not appeared since the noon hour
and a cautious reconnoiter of the prem-
ises encouraged belief that it would be
safe to pay a visit to the corrals
bradys horse had been turned into the
pasture but there were several likely-
looking cow-ponies in the pole en-
closure and it would be almost an ad-
venture to go down and look them over
he felt like a released prisoner the
skies took on a deep blue the air was
sweet and balmy while the mountains
rimmed in the horizon with a beauty he
never before appreciated

  brady was engrossed in sizing up a
smart-looking little bay when he was
startled almost into panic by a sweetly
modulated voice at his very elbow

  ive been looking for one of the
boys to saddle a horse for me is there
anyone around

  he whirled to discover doreen stand-
ing disturbingly close to his side she
was so much prettier than he had
thought when observing her from a
show em cowboy



distance that he was forced to swallow
twice before he could speak

  n-no he stammered i-i mean
theres nobody around but me b-but
ill catch your horse and saddle him
thanks she returned was there
just a shade of doubt in her tone that
suggestion brought the color to his
face until he felt as if his cheeks were
on fire ill ride the gray she said
turning back to the house and calling
over her shoulder hes easy to catch
and ill be ready in five minutes
brady glowered at the inoffensive
gray easy to catch she thinks i
dont know enough to rope a horse he
grumbled im sure gonna quit this
job pronto

  his ire rose when the pony gave him
no trouble at all youre nothin but a
darned old plug he raged a mere
baby could saddle you up why in
blazes dont you show a little self-
respecting spirit sos i can let her see
i aint just a sourdough mixer

  although he accomplished the task
quickly brady wilson had never sad-
dled a horse with such care doreen
appeared as he fastened the latigo

  thanks she said again while her
lips assumed the slight smile with
which she had favored him on his first
morning at the ranch

  that smile instantly melted his de-
termination to depart in fact so
mesmeric was its power that he could
not even move from the spot where his
feet seemed glued she sprang lightly
to the saddle and loped away

  i sure act just like a dumb pot-
wrastler he raged at himself walking
slowly back to the cook house he had
no further desire for exploration out-
side even if the coast was clear seclu-
sion where he could anathematize the
foreman of the cross bar was what he
wanted at that particular time

  that jordan gates disliked me at
first sight and i guess the feeling was
mutual all right he thought but i
wonder if hes getting the fun he
counted on outa the poor joke he
sprung ill get even with him some-

time but when i do ill be darned sure
to get my laugh

  bradys rancor towards the cross
bar foreman was not lessened that
evening when as he stood at the long
table washing dishes gates rode into
the yard tying his horse with the man-
ner of one familiar with the place and
walking nonchalantly to the house

  brady wilson had no ear for cowboy
gossip that night all his efforts at
hearing were concentrated on the
sounds brought from the ranch house
on the evening breeze these added to
his state of unrest olivers deep
laughter came at intervals then some-
one struck a few chords on the piano
and doreen sang brady took a seat on
the bench outside the cook house
never did ballads so enthrall a listener
if he only could have forgotten that
she was singing to jordan gates the
cowboy would have been in an earthly
heaven

  presently a false note in the harmony
was supplied by duffys nasal tones
audible from the bunkhouse gates
sure likes music-cornin three times a
week to hold a concert wonder how
long itll be fore he coaxes the song-
bird over to the cross bar to stay

  aw i cant see what miss doreend
want of that piano-playin cow-
puncher red could be heard grum-
bling

  cowpuncher came scornfully in
another voice he aint no puncher
jordan gates is foreman-and dont no-
body forget it an hes only a cowboy
by adoption anyhow he aint no son
of the cow country

  at that moment the song came to an
end and brady was glad so that
hombres playin her accompaniments
he thought resentfully jealously
imagining the scene in the ranch
house

 he remained on the bench until
gates took his departure about an hour
later the voices of both oliver and
his niece were audible bidding the
guest good night he was gratified to
discover that doreen did not come out-


ranch romances

side for an added word with the cross
bar foreman

  twenty-six more days o cookin
brady groaned then he hummed
ironically

   eleven more months an ten more days
      theyre gonna turn me loose

   eleven more months an ten more days

      an ill be outa the calaboose

  from that moment something be-
sides the coffee boiled in the cook
house with every hour he spent there
bradys resentment mounted higher
mister piano-playin foreman better
watch out when i cut loose from that
stove he vowed itll be my turn to
play a few jokes

  seemingly careless questions elicited
from the boys no hint of where he
might get a cowboys job when the
thirty days were up but he doggedly
assured himself that he would find one
and as much as possible he managed
to keep out of doreens sight each
time her glance rested on him he could
scarcely hold his head in its usual erect
position while his cheeks always
burned hotly

  doggone it he thought she aint
goin to be able to think of me as any-
thing but a cook itll take me a long
time to live this down ill have to do
some lively cowpunchin to make her
forget seein me mix sourdough and
peel spuds for the oliver crew

  about every second day or evening
jordan gates appeared at the double
o his visits rasped brady almost un-
endurably and he agreed with red who
exclaimed at supper one night when
gates had just ridden up to the house

  if i was thad warner id tell that
feller i didnt want a foreman that did
his bossin by long distance youd
think it was this ranch jord gates is
runnin

  the second time brady had speech
with doreen was late one afternoon
the cross bar foreman was at the
house and it seemed a good opportunity
to pay a visit to the storeroom to reach
which it was necessary to pass uncom-
fortably close to the kitchen door and

one could never tell when the girl
might be busy there

  just as he was bending over a sack
to scoop sugar into his big tin can-
and with no previous sound to warn of
her approach-doreens voice startled
him rising with a jerk he found her
at his side as she had been on the
former occasion at the corral and the
disturbing elusive smile was again on
her lips

  i need some things she said sim-
ply and i thought you would reach
them down from the shelves for me
s-sure sure-glad to he mumbled
hating himself for the wave of con-
fusion which washed over him the
late sunshine pouring through the
doorway brought out the high-lights in
her hair fascinating him he could
scarcely remove his gaze from the soft
curls capping her head and when he

did	he found himself in the fresh diffi-
culty of looking straight into her eyes
he felt himself sinking down    down
   into their intensely blue depths
this spell was not broken until she
spoke then her voice seemed to come
from a long ways off

  i want some coffee some soda and
a bottle of that vanilla

  brady turned to the shelf dazedly
trying to locate the articles he reached
down several cans striving wildly to
find something to say

  no-no doreen halted him merri-
ment in her voice one can of coffees
enough and vanilla please-not
iodine and the sodas there beside
the rice

  not looking into her face he handed
her the last article then turned hastily
to replace the extra cans of coffee on
the shelf hoping she would go at once
but she halted on the threshold with
an exclamation

oh i almost forgot-i need flour
brady still had sense enough to re-
member that a sack of flour weighed
fifty pounds that was no burden for
a girl

   ill carry it in for you he offered
still without facing her
show em cowboy



  she thanked him moving to the
threshold but she waited for him to
lift the sack and join her keeping at
his side as they went to the kitchen
just set the flour on that chair she
directed as he started towards the bin
that was pulled half out of the wall
cupboard ill fix it when i make the
biscuits and thanks a lot

  temptation was too great again
brady looked at her and she smiled-
a real smile this time that dawned in
her eyes to come into full radiance on
her lips he did not hear steps ap-
proaching through the dining room
with the stunning force of bullets
came words edged with patronizing
scorn

  oh so youre cooking for the
house too

  brady turned his head to stare into
jordan gates greenish eyes doreen
spoke instantly

  no he just helped me to carry in
some supplies

  the cross bar foremans gaze swept
the kitchen halted briefly at the flour
bin then came to brady wilson with
real hatred but he addressed the girl
i see-but you dont have to go to the
cook shack for help when im around
why didnt you call me

  youre much too dressed up to be
handling flour she laughed

  brady left the kitchen but he could
hear gates commenting in derogatory
tones that fellows not like the boys
youre used to around here hes just
a drifting no-account-glad to wrastle
pots you cant treat him friendly like
you do our boys because he wont un-
derstand hell take advantage

  no doreens voice held a ques-
tioning inflection he is very polite-
and quite shy

  i tell you youve got him wrong
forgive me doreen i dont like to see
you stoop to be nice to such a worth-
less fellow

  indeed now she spoke crisply
theres no occasion for your criticism
jordan-none at all

  i think there is he flared back with

anger when you get him to carry in
flour you dont need just to have a
chance to flirt with him

  to bradys astonishment doreens
laughter rang out with infectious
gaiety dont be silly jordan her
voice came clearly followed at once by
the booming tones of jude oliver who
had just come up from the corral
greeting the visitor with no idea of the
recent scene

  brady hurried back to the cook
house mi-gosh he breathed that
flour bin was most half full i won-
der   

  that wonder combined with the ex-
citing memories of his recent en-
counter rendered brady immune to the
usual disgust with his cooks duties
and he allowed himself to dream that
evening that doreen had perhaps been
curious to discover what he really was
like maybe she was the tiniest bit in-
terested however by morning his
doubts returned he remembered the
laughter in her eyes as they stood in
the storeroom

  shes just having fun he con-
cluded she thinks im what her aunt
said that afternoon when they was talk-
ing-im a no-good puncher thats fell
back on cookin

  during the ensuing days brady
sometimes felt sure that doreen was
watching him but she made no fur-
ther attempt at speech until almost a
week had passed then she was quite
impersonal and she did not smile in
fact she seemed to have erected a little
barrier about herself brady wondered
wrathfully if gates had after all af-
fected her with his remarks

  meanwhile there was excitement
among the crew red had announced
his intention of trying to ride the for-
midable roan bucking horse owned by
thad warren of the cross bar while
his mates were ready to back him with
encouragement there was no feeling of
confidence that he would make it the
best riders in the locality including
some famous rodeo hands had failed
and while red had plenty of assurance


ranch romances

he lacked staying power-something
essential to any man who would ride
dynamite to a finish

  the third vsunday of brady wilsons
month as cook was the one set for the
contest but on the previous friday
reds horse fell bruising his rider
badly and breaking three ribs at first
red was determined to ride dynamite
anyhow the matterwas under hot dis-
cussion at the corrals on saturday
afternoon when jordan gates rode
up

  well put off that ride of reds
oliver told the cross bar foreman

  of course gates agreed in his
usual manner of mingled superiority
and patronage he wouldnt have a
chance-be licked before he hit the
saddle

  too bad doreen said sympatheti-
cally aware of reds disappointment
i was all ready to go over and cheer
for him

  maybe one of the other boys would
like to try gates suggested as one
who believes he is uttering an ab-
surdity

  but the words hit brady wilson like
a sharp spur rowel he continued to
lean easily against the corral fence but
there was nothing languid in the ex-
pression of his eyes as he said coolly

  sure-ill go over and give dyna-
mite a try

  all eyes turned towards the cook

 jordan gates laughed with loud
abandon good joke he gasped

  brady drew himself erect there was
a calm smile on his lips but his jaw set
with determination no joke he said
i mean it ill be over sunday

  surprise incredulity then admira-
tion for his audacity passed over the
faces of the double o cowboys the
rancher himself turned to give brady a
long appraising glance but olivers
expression was inscrutable gates gave
vent to another outburst of laughter

  all right cookie he said con-
descendingly ill tell the boss

  jude oliver gates and the girl
moved towards the house while the

cowboys burst into eager argument
but brady wilson said little

  yes i can ride pretty fair he told
duffy i know what im about

  the straw boss shook his head he
believed that the new cook might have
other than culinary attainments but he
knew too much about dynamite to feel
like encouraging brady in such
folly

  when he thought the matter over
calmly brady was surprised at himself
im considerable out of practice-rid-
in buckers he reflected and it looks
like ive taken on something pretty big
but i couldnt stand it any longer-had
to bust loose and do something now
ive got to ride to win im plumb sick
of that gates hombre laughin so much
around here

  arrived at the cross bar ranch sun-
day afternoon brady wilson found a
sizable crowd of neighboring ranchers
and cowpunchers gathered there any
hint of an attempt to ride the outlaw
dynamite always drew eager specta-
tors he felt a certain quietness in the
atmosphere-a tenseness which was
hardly warranted by such an event and
which could be accounted for only by
the fact that he was unpopular with the
crowd they think jude olivers
cooks got unlimited nerve to try to
ride a horse thats thrown all the best
riders in this end of the cow country
brady decided

  jordan gates was very officious
dressed in his sunday best even his
boots polished till they shone like a
new stove he went about repeating
the phrase he had coined for the oc-
casion

  glad to see you out for the cooking
exhibition dynamites going to roll a
sourdough biscuit for us directly
maybe doreen landis said arch-
ing her brows oddly when gates
sprung the remark on her

  while the oliver crew had appeared
more or less indifferent natural loyalty
for a member of their own outfit began
to crop out bradys ear caught red
assuring jordan gates he may not
show em cowboy



ride him slick but ill bet you a months
wages he will ride him

  thanks red brady said to him-
self as he carried his saddle out into
the big round corral where the raw-
boned roan had been cut out by himself

  men were lined up around the fence
watching for the most part their ex-
pressions indicated that they already
knew what the outcome would be
brady laid the saddle down carefully
on its side then unbuckled his lariat
disturbed by the crowd on the fence
and by the sight of man and saddle in
the corral dynamite trotted nervously
about head up emitting an occasional
snort from his wide full nostrils

  brady ran out a small loop and with
a neat back-handed throw the rope
snapped around the neck of the roan
he reared striking at the rope with
front feet then charged a few tirnes
before allowing the cowboy to walk up
to him brady took his time but had
no especial difficulty putting on hacka-
more and saddle the outlaw had been
saddled so often that he was no longer
much disturbed over that part of the
procedure

  from the corner of his eye the cow-
boy saw doreen standing on the seat of
a wagon that had been drawn up beside
the corral to afford a good view for the
women spectators her eyes were shin-
ing with excitement and her face
mirrored a tense expression

  ive got the opportunity ive been
praying for brady wilson told him-
self his heart beating high as he pre-
pared to mount and shes there
watching-old roany youre as good
as rode

 the crowd had been exchanging
good-natured jibes and offering free
advice but dead silence fell as brady
a twisted ear in his left hand grabbed
the saddle horn with his right then
he eased his foot into the stirrup and
smooth as a trout leaping a falls went
into the saddle

  dynamite exploded brady knew in-
stantly that the horse had been appro-
priately named he seemed to fly into

a million pieces that left nothing but a
saddle to ride a saddle that was
caught by first one then another of the
leaping flying twisting fragments of
what had been a horse a lone saddle
falling shooting sideways rolling
changing direction and shape with the
speed of a comet ground and corrals
became a blur then blotted out alto-
gether the world held nothing but
himself and the terrifically jolting sad-
dle that pounded him almost into in-
sensibility

  it was uncanny the way those pieces
of horse flew apart or came together
with that peculiar twist and horrible
jolt which centered in the small of the
back each impact seeming powerful
enough to catapult the rider into the
next county

  brady knew the roan was a long-
winded bucker-just how long no one
had ever stayed with him to find out
the cowboy had previously made up
his mind to attempt no grandstand
ride there was too much at stake he
did not fan the bucker with quirt or
spur beyond the natural strokes that
would help keep his balance with the
momentum of that whirling slamming
ball of lightning

  dynamite was a glutton for endur-
ance after his first cyclonic round he
slowed down to straight pitching a few
seconds this all but cost brady his
seat for he relaxed a trifle then the
roan turned on his second tornado of
hell and brimstone this was a more
ferocious effort than the first and
brady knew he was up against the ride
of his life shouts came dimly to his
ears his brain seemed pounded to
numbness then a certain girlish voice
penetrated his dulled mind clear as
the tone of a violin

  take it out of him brady show
em cowboy show em

  there was no mistaking that voice
its vibrating eagerness his vision
cleared his muscles caught the flying
pieces were able to hold them together
a lot of electricity was disappearing
from the jolts dynamite was actually


ranch romances

slowing down he broke into a buck-
ing run circled the corral a few more
times then stopped short planting his
forefeet stiffly his sides worked like
a bellows

  brady looked up warner sat on the
top rail of the corral a few feet dis-
tant

  did i ride him slick

 you sure did the old cowman
agreed readily and whats more you
put up the best ride i ever saw get
down-youve earned your money all
right

  brady stepped off removed saddle
and hackamore from the panting roan
and carried them through the gate to
his own horse he had a passing
glimpse of the cross bar foreman far
away on the fringe of the crowd but
just then he felt little interest in
jordan gates doreen landis still
stood in the wagon and for a second
brady wilson gazed straight into her
eyes then he was surrounded by the
jubilant double o cowboys

  he didnt mind cooking supper for
the outfit that night the afternoons
performance had removed all stigma
from his present position but he
found that he was still seized with con-
fusion when he imagined himself ap-
proaching doreen

  doggone it he assured himself
she was cheering me on-she wanted
me to win-and i aint going to be
afraid of her any more i dont hafta
run and hide like a permanent sour-
dough mixer

  but it took more courage to cross the
yard about dusk when doreen ap-
peared in the kitchen door than it had
taken to put his saddle on dynamite
that afternoon to his surprise she dis-
played signs of confusion when he
drew near and that added to his own
courage

  that was a fine ride you made she
said hurriedly

  thanks he replied hoping she
could not hear the pounding of his
heart thats my business-ridin and

-

punchin cows-and im going to stick
to it when i finish my month out there
he gave a quick nod towards the cook
house

  oh i should think you would
doreen exclaimed recovering some-
thing of her customary poise i
couldnt imagine why you wanted to
cook

  w-wanted to brady stammered
reddening i didnt-i hated it but
i had to get a job around here and that
was the only one

 oh how funny she said the
elusive smile curving her lips

  i had to stay around here because i
saw you that morning in town and
there wasnt no going away after i
looked at you once

  suddenly doreen retreated a few
steps what a nice compliment she
remarked in attempted lightness
wont you come in

  brady started to cross the threshold
then halted he extended a hand to
grasp one of hers no-i dont want
to talk to you in any kitchen come
out under the stars

  but i dont want-

  yes you do brady insisted the
expression in her eyes adding to his
courage you do want to listen to me
he drew her gently forward i heard
you cheering me this afternoon when
a girl cheers a hombre that way dont
she like him a little bit

  of course doreen agreed readily
making an attempt to release her hand

  but brady led her gently across the
yard to the shadow of a box alder

 we were awfully proud to have
someone on the double o ride dyna-
mite she went on in rather a hurried
tone and uncle jude-

  mi-gosh brady gasped never
mind dynamite and uncle jude i
cant wait any longer to tell you-
the last words were inaudible because
they were spoken against her lips

  and he didnt care if she did know
how his heart was pounding-hers was
doing the very same thing

chapter xii

a successful bargain

ted gaynor paused as he was
saddling his horse to start on the
long ride back to his home to ar-
range for moving his mother and
sister to their new quarters he glanced
down toward kays cabin and obeying
a sudden impulse left his horse and
walked quickly down to the tiny log
house

  the door was locked so he knocked
vigorously since he received no re-
sponse he turned away and made for
the bunkhouse on the run springing
up the steps he nearly collided with
seth as he pushed in the door and met
him on his way out

   hullo seth exclaimed in surprise
i thought you were on your way long
ago

  somethings got me worried ted
explained i tried to find kay but shes
off somewhere

   i saw her start out on flicker about
a half hour ago seth answered
whats on your mind

  i dont think she ought to let any
grass grow under her feet before nail-
ing that option ted declared as far
as i can see thats the only available

timber there is and we ought to make
sure theres no slip-up

  hells bells there cant be any slip-
up seth ejaculated why old man
warrenll be tickled pink to get rid of
it

  just the same id be a lot easier to
know that it was all sewed up ted
looked from seth to two of the boys
who had come up and were listening in
have any of you fellows got any
cash

  sure seth answered why
because if we can scrape up twenty-
five dollars or so ill go in and make
a first payment on the option in kays
name so there cant be any chance of
her losing it

  i cant see as theres all that rush
about it seth observed still and all
theres no harm in getting that out of
the way it would be kind of a nice
surprise for kay to find it all attended
to he pulled out a roll of bills and
counted off seventeen dollars how
about chipping in

  he cocked an eye at the other two
who readily complied and between
them they made up a pool of twenty-
five dollars

  go to it son if youve got a hunch
that way seth handed ted the money
bring the option back and well give it
to kay this evening

  ill do that ted promised putting
the wad of bills in his pocket ill start
off for home after supper

  on the way in to red river over the
same route that kay and he had taken
that morning teds thoughts of kay
were so absorbing that the time passed
almost as quickly as it had in her actual
company it seemed impossible that he
had known the girl only about twenty-
four hours the dramatic events that
had followed in such rapid succession
after their fateful meeting might have
filled a year instead of a day so
completely had he changed in the
interval

  because of that meeting which might
have had such a different ending if any-
one but kay with her deep instinctive
fire frenzy



understanding of human nature had
found him at that act of desperation
his whole outlook on life was changed
just the relief of knowing that his moth-
er and sister had a home to come to
was enough to make a new man of him
but added to that the thought that he
was to be near kay helping her and
planning for her opened up untold vis-
tas of hopes that were too magic to be
indulged in

  ted found old man warrens shack
without any trouble he knocked on
the door which was pulled open after
a minute or two and he found him-
self facing the grizzled old prospector
who eyed him with suspicious sur-
prise

  what do you want he demanded
inhospitably

  i wanted to see you about buying
some of that timberland that you hold
on the south ridge of the bitter root
ted answered having all he could do
to keep from laughing aloud at the com-
ical change that came over old man
warrens fierce expression

  whats that he asked his face
screwed up and his eyes squinted as
though he doubted the evidence of his
senses whatd you say

  ted repeated the purpose of his
visit

  gosh halifax almighty his host
opened the door wide and pulling ted
in hastily closed it behind him i sure
never thought id live to hear that you
got any real money he blinked sus-
piciously at his visitor

  ive twenty-five dollars to say im in
earnest ted answered im offering
you a hundred dollars for ten acres and
an option on another ten at the same
price and im ready to pay that twen-
ty-five right now on deposit

  say young fella whats your game
old man warren demanded you been
prospectin up there

  ted laughed no thats out of my
line i dont want it for myself he
added frankly im buying it for kay
crandon

  old man warrens suspicious little

eyes screwed up still more whats
she after started already to have a
fling with her insurance money
maybe ted gladly let his host put
his own interpretation on kays pur-
pose the less he guessed kays vital
need for the property the better

  well if she wants it that bad strikes
me shell pay more now that shes got
all that money to sling around the
old prospector announced with cun-
ning you tell her i aint selling for
a mite less than twenty dollars an
acre

  ted turned carelessly toward the door
no point telling her that he observed
theres plenty of timberland to be
bought at ten dollars an acre and even
less ill just pick it up somewhere else
without bothering you any more kay
thought youd like to sell and told me
to give you the first chance he pulled
open the door so long

 hi there wait a minute you
dont need to be in such a doggone rush
i didnt say i wouldnt sell did i old
man warren pulled him back have
it your own way he capitulated then
he added greedily wheres that twen-
ty-five bucks

  well get this down in black and
white first ted sat down at the rough
pine board table and drew up a memo-
randum of the transaction which old
man warren signed

  here you are ted said handing him
the money he put the precious mem-
orandum in his pocket smiling as he
watched his host count the twenty-five
dollars with loving care youre well
rid of it he observed as he turned to
the door again buyers arent any too
plentiful these days

  old man warren nodded impatiently
but made no response as he started to
count his unexpected wealth again
with a so long that this time was ac-
cepted ted went out and mounted his
horse well satisfied with his afternoons
work

  going back at a more leisurely pace
he was about five miles west of red
river when he noticed far off in the


ranch romances

distance a dark object that looked like
someone on foot after he reined in
he scanned the horizon to confirm his
impression but he could see nothing
telling himself that he was a victim of
an optical illusion he dismissed the in-
cident from his mind and pushed on to
the lazy nine

  on arriving at the bunkhouse he
found it deserted while he stood for
a moment on the steps he turned over
in his mind the question of waiting un-
til someone came in off the range to
deliver the document to kay for him
or of just leaving it with a note for
seth

  it was a great temptation to wait un-
til kay came back and give it to her
himself he could just see her eyes
sparkle and her nose crinkle up with
amusement when she heard of old man
warrens attempt at bargaining on
the other hand he ought to be starting
for home as soon as possible as it was
hed have to ride all night before he ar-
rived there

  debating this point in his mind he
suddenly heard pounding hoofbeats and
the next minute flicker came in sight
riderless with his reins dragging and
his ears back as he headed on a dead
run for the corral with a fearful cer-
tainty that something had happened to
kay ted leaped down the bunkhouse
steps and threw himself into the saddle
of his waiting mount everything for-
gotten but kays safety

  a sudden flash of memory brought
to mind that impression he had had of
having seen someone on foot far to the
north of him as he rode out from red
river was it possible that kay had
had the same hunch as his about the
wisdom of seeing about the option at
once and that she had ridden in to red
river and had some accident hap-
pened on the way

  cursing himself for not having inves-
tigated then and there ted headed off
at a hard gallop in the general direc-
tion of the place where he had thought
he had seen that figure for a fleeting
moment

chapter xiii

rescue

left to herself kay sank back and
gave way for a moment to the
weak dizzy feeling that closed over her
through her half-conscious state she
could hear the retreating hoofbeats of
scrap johnsons horse grow dimmer and
dimmer in the distance finally they
died away and the unbroken stillness
of the mesa deepened around her and
seemed to be dragging her into its own
oblivion

  fighting down the temptation to let
go and sink back into it kay struggled
into a sitting position and forced her-
self to take stock of her desperate situa-
tion her jaws ached cruelly under the
tightly tied bandanna and her legs and
arms were unbearably cramped from
their forced confinement but bad as the
physical pain and discomfort were her
mental anguish was far worse

  she hadnt a doubt but that all her
plans for rebuilding had come to noth-
ing and worse than that it was prac-
tically a foregone conclusion that josh
hastings would eventually get the
ranch for the first time kay admitted
to herself that he was too powerful and
unscrupulous for her to fight him suc-
cessfully but even though her mind
recognized this fact she found that hope
still persisted

  as she desperately analyzed that
hope she realized that it centered
around ted gaynor somehow or other
he might get around this last blow that
she had so stupidly brought on herself

  despite her effort to thrust the
thought of scrap johnson into the back-
ground of her mind and to cling to the
conviction that he wouldnt dare to do
her any actual harm a shudder ran over
kay at the thought of his return he
had all the instincts of a bully and he
had shown himself capable of sickening
revenge for the wounds she had inflicted
on his vanity

  her lips burned at the memory of his
kiss and panic seized her as she realized
how powerless she was in his hands
fire frenzy



even if he didnt do her any actual
harm she would never get over the in-
dignity that he had imposed upon her
she was galvanized to action by this
desperate thought the ranch and every-
thing else were forgotten in the surge
of self-preservation that swept over her
kay roiled over and struggled up to her
knees

  the incline of the coulee behind her
shut her off from a view of the range
and ruined any chance of her discovery
by any passer-by not that there was
likely to be anyone but it was a hun-
dred to one chance some way or other
she must get up there and her courage
revived with the prospect of an imme-
diate objective to be obtained kay
gazed piercingly about for some sharp
stone on which she might saw through
her bonds

  nothing was to be seen but small
stones and pebbles scattered through
the bunch grass of the mesa and kays
heart sank as this first hope proved vain
resolving to get up in the open bonds
or no bonds kay managed to edge pain-
fully up the slope by using her elbows
and knees to puil herself along

  the distance which could have been
covered by a few strides on foot seemed
endless when negotiated in this painful
fashion but at last she reached the top
and sank back faint with exhaustion
opening her eyes she could see the
range stretching out in its undulating
waves to the horizon on the south and
east while to the north and west the
mountains rose to intercept its vast
space

  there was not a sign of life in all the
endless expanse in a kind of stupor
kay watched the flickering waves of
heat that made the air seem to vibrate
against the blue sky a merciful ob-
livion was stealing over her when sud-
denly against the sky on the horizon
to the south she saw outlined the sil-
houette of a horseman

  the first sickening dread that it might
be scrap johnson was superseded by
the realization that he wouldnt be rid-
ing so far to the south resolving that

-ranch romances-fir sect

whoever the rider was she would rather
trust herself to him than to scrap john-
son kay took fresh courage

  strengthened by new hope she strug-
gled to her knees gazing desperately at
the distant apparition unless she could
stand up there wasnt a chance that he
could see her kay edged her way over
to a smooth boulder at some little dis-
tance from her then by bracing herself
against it she managed to pull herself
up on her feet as she wavered uncer-
tainly on the one foot that was in a
position to take a solid stand on the
ground her heart gave a great leap and
a strangled cry beat against the muf-
fling bandanna

  she watched the horseman come to a
standstill and although he was only a
speck in the distance kay was con-
vinced that he was gazing her way in
an instinctive impulsive effort to jerk her
arms up and signal to him she lost her
balance and sank back to the ground
straining and panting she tried again
to get up her eyes never leaving the
silhouetted figure

  with a groan of desperation she saw
him resume his way after his disap-
pearance her courage forsook her and
she gave way to the rushing blackness
that enveloped her

  sleeping beauty eh

  kay came to to realize that scrap
johnson was standing over her she
kept her eyes closed as she summoned
all her courage to meet the ordeal ahead
if she kept her wits about her there
might yet be some way out there
must be some decency in the man she
could appeal to but she musnt show
any fear

  he gave a low whistle ill say
youve done some traveling he ob-
served kind of hard going what
he stooped down and loosened her
gag no point in covering up those
red lips any longer he laughed mock-
ingly as he straightened up again
come on cutie i know youre sham-
ming open up those brown eyes of
yours i like to see em snap

 kay opened her eyes and looked


ranch romances

straight at him without moving all
her will-power was shining in their hyp-
notic depths and in spite of himself
scrap johnson gave an embarrassed
laugh and took a backward step

  if youll cut these bonds and ride
away from here-kays voice was low
and intent as she held him with her
gaze-ill agree to keep still about
whats happened thats your only
chance to stay on this range and live

  for a moment he wavered then with
a hoarse laugh he stooped down beside
her and put his arm around her

  a bird in the hands worth two in
the bush he gloated breathing heavily
his eyes avoided hers and focused on
her lips and kay felt a sick rush of
terror

  in their absorption neither had heard
the thud of distant hoofbeats but now
they both became aware of them drop-
ping kay with an oath scrap johnson
sprang to his feet and seized his gun
in the same instant kay kicked out
fiercely against his shins her bound feet
catching him unawares and throwing
him off his balance he crashed to the
ground his gun exploding harmlessly
in the air

  through the waves of blackness that
assailed her kay heard the pounding
of hoofs and ted gaynors voice call-
ing lie still if you move youre a
goner

  galvanized to life again by the mira-
cle of hearing teds voice kay shrank
away from the prone figure at her feet
that suddenly ceased struggling at the
deadly threat behind teds command
with her heart in her throat she turned
and gazed at the oncoming figure of her
rescuer

chapter xiv

an ultimatum

taking in the situation at a glance
ted pulled his mount to a sliding
stop and slipped off his eyes fixed on
scrap johnson whom he held covered
with the gun kay had given him a
foot or two away from him scrap john-

sons gun lay where it had fallen just
out of reach but dangerously near

  ted shifted his aim for one fraction
of a second from scrap johnson and
sent a shot that shattered the gun to bits
then he covered the man on the ground
again before he had a chance to
move

  get out of his reach kay ted
called without once taking his eyes off
his victim i dont aim to have him
try to use you as a shield

  without a word kay obeyed drag-
ging herself well out of reach of scrap
johnson in case he should try any such
desperate maneuver

  now get up you

  it seemed to kay that she had never
heard such controlled fury in any hu-
man voice after a moments hesita-
tion the flying six puncher rose to his
feet

  pitch em and keep em there

  with a snarl he obeyed and kay
glanced fearfully from one man to the
other what was to be the outcome of
this encounter

  turn around teds voice rang out
again and as his prisoner obeyed he
reached with his free hand for the rope
on the pommel of his saddle

  stepping swiftly over to scrap john-
son ted pressed his gun into his back
at the same time putting a loop around
his raised hands after he had jerked
them down he expertly trussed john-
sons arms to his sides then tripped
him and finished the job of hogtying
him ted left him where he had dropped
and strode over to kay with quick
clean cuts of his knife he severed the
ropes that bound her

  are you all right his breath came
quickly as he gazed with desperate anx-
iety into kays eyes

  she nodded a tremulous reassuring
smile on her lips yes thanks to you

  ted handed her her fathers gun that
she had given him

  take this and if anything happens
to me you can protect yourself but
nothing will happen his voice still
vibrated with the same deadly fury
fire frenzy



  what are you going to do kay
demanded

  much as id like to i cant kill this
cowardly coyote in cold blood if he
hasnt harmed you and im not going
to drag him to the sheriff to have this
noised about the range so im going
to give him a second lesson he wont
forget and if he ever shows up on the
range again i will kill him

  no-no kay cried in a terror-
stricken voice leave him bound and
lets go

  without appearing to hear her ted
stepped swiftly away and called con-
temptuously to scrap johnson

  thats only a slip noose get your-
self free and come and take your les-
son

  a look of mingled surprise and elation
gleamed in scrap johnsons eyes as he
strained against the ropes and felt them
give shaking himself loose he crouched
for a moment then made a rush for
ted all the fury of his former defeat
in the attack he launched at him

  it seemed to kay that it was hours
instead of seconds that with her heart
in her mouth she watched the struggle
between the two men both were slight
in build though scrap johnson had a
decided advantage in weight and gen-
eral physical fitness the outraged fury
at the indignity that had been put on
kay however added an invincible fury
to teds attack that far outweighed any
mere physical advantage of the other

  sidestepping his opponents fist-
swinging rush ted came back at him
with a blow that sent him staggering
backwards when johnson recovered
his balance he lowered his head with
a roar of rage and butted it into teds
stomach like a battering ram but ted
countered with a swinging uppercut
that found its mark in spite of the pain-
ful contraction of his muscles at the
foul blow

  ted followed up his advantage like
one possessed as he landed one punish-
ing blow after another finally forcing
his antagonist to his knees panting
and blinking the sweat out of his eyes

he drew back and as scrap johnson
struggled to his feet and lunged for
him ted planted a knockout blow on
the mans chin that snapped his head
back with a sickening twist with a
groan he toppled to the ground and lay
still

  kay let out a long quivering breath
as ted stood panting for a moment
then he walked over to her and took
back the gun from her trembling hand

  itll be some time before he comes
to in spite of his effort to steady it
his voice showed the effect of the emo-
tional and physical ordeal he had just
been through the sooner we get off
the better unless i miss my guess
hell vamoose from this range without
too much boasting about this after-
noons doings

  he slipped the gun in his holster and
stepped over to scrap johnsons horse
which was patiently waiting at some
distance from the late fray his reins
over his neck picking up the reins
ted hung them over the pommel of the
saddle then giving him a sharp blow
on the flank he stampeded him off
across the mesa

  that bird can walk it will do him
good and work out his stiffness he
observed grimly glancing at the uncon-
scious figure on the ground as he came
back to kay how about our getting
under way

 ted - wait kays eyes were
enormous with the force of an idea that
she was struggling with that man
has the option on our timberland right
there in his pocket

  ted stared at her in bewilderment
was her mind giving under the strain

  no he hasnt kay he soothed as
he led his horse over to her ill tell
you about that on the way home

  but he has kay declared passion-
ately gazing with a fascinated horror
at the inert figure stretched on the mesa
he got it by trickery and if you wont
take it way from him im going to
wait a minute ted seized both
her hands in one of his as he fumbled
with the other for a paper in his pocket


ranch romances

no need for you to rifle his pockets
he added flourishing it triumphantly
before her

  with amazement kay ran her eyes
over the memorandum of teds trans-
action with old man warren with
the prospectors name signed at the
bottom

  ted you mean you beat him to
it her eyes sparkled with excitement
and the color flooded her cheeks at this
further evidence of teds thought for
her

  in a few words he told her about seth
and the boys chipping in to raise enough
to bind the purchase and about his visit
to old man warren

  i dont know anything about beating
this guy to it he added feasting his
eyes on her happy excitement as she
folded the precious paper and put it in
her pocket youll have to tell me that
part of it come on

  a swift strong vibration ran all
through him at the thought of holding
kay in his arms as they rode back to
the ranch mounting he reached down
his hand and she sprang lightly up be-
fore him her own heightened color at-
testing to the fact that his emotion had
communicated itself to her

  for a long time they rode in silence
across the mesa that was beginning to
take on the more intense colors and the
lengthened shadows of late afternoon
kay leaned confidingly against ted and
his arm involuntarily tightened around
her somehow there seemed to be no
need for words and sweet as the gay
companionship of the mornings ride had
been this silent communion meant in-
finitely more

  the sunset colors were flooding the
sky as they neared the ranch house gate

  abruptly ted reined in id like to
say good-by to you here i must be on
my way he hardly recognized his
low husky voice a wild longing to kiss
kay before he released her swept over
him but even as he struggled with it
kay slipped from his arm and sprang
lightly to the ground

  when will you be back kays

voice was as low and vibrant with sup-
pressed feeling as his

  three days at the most he an-
swered for a long moment he gazed
at her he started to say something
then changed his mind and picked up
the reins

  good-by he wheeled abruptly
and kay watched him ride into the sun-
set a strange premonition suddenly
tightened her throat would he really
be back in three days already their
whole tense and dramatic encounter
seemed like a dream

  turning swiftly she walked past the
charred ruins of the ranch house and
down to her cabin skirting the bunk-
house in a desire to be alone for a few
minutes before accounting for her ab-
sence to the boys

chapter xv

an unexpected visitor

absorbed in her thoughts kay
walked swiftly down to the cabin
her eyes absently-mindedly fixed on the
browning bunch grass at her feet

  hullo there you are

  a hearty voice startled her out of her
reverie as she glanced up she saw
the tall figure of a man waiting for her
on the cabin steps reluctantly relin-
quishing her hope for solitude she hur-
ried forward and recognized tom run-
yon as the waiting figure

  say i couldnt wait any longer to
come over and tell you how bad i feel
about all this he waved toward the
ruins of the ranch house as he came
down the steps to meet her his eyes
as they rested on her brilliant coloring
and the flush still in her cheeks from
the ride with ted expressed the same
admiration they had on the ridge i
had to stick around up yonder until i
was relieved he explained or id have
been over sooner

 thats very good of you kay
slipped her hand out of his grasp i
certainly didnt think when i talked
to you last that id find my own house
burnt down
fire frenzy



  i kind of thought i might be some
help tom runyon boomed pomp-
ously ive been talking with that fore-
man of yours up at the bunkhouse and
it looks mighty peculiar to me how this
fire started

  kay shot him a startled look you
mean you think-

  im not thinking anything he has-
tened to say with a cautious lowering
of his voice im only saying that this
and any other fire will bear investigat-
ing

  kay felt all her first suspicions revive
but she remembered dan steeles warn-
ing and held her peace while this tom
runyon seemed all right and a kindly
and genial enough person she didnt
really know anything about him so it
would pay to go slow

  if on the other hand he wanted to
go ahead investigating on his ovn in-
itiative he might unearth something
that would give some foundation for her
suspicion of josh hastings but while
she must be very careful not to voice
the direction in which her suspicions
lay there was one point on which she
must set him straight right away

  i am absolutely certain that seth and
our outfit are above suspicion she
stated positively so if youre looking
for foul play you can count them out
from the start

  maybe he nodded his approval of
her loyalty but when youre starting
out to look for clues you cant be handi-
capped by any foregone conclusions
you just leave the investigating to me
he added tolerantly all i want you
to do is to answer a few questions
gladly but lets wait until after sup-
per kay leaned against the side of
the cabin for a second overcome by a
sudden weary faintness

  tom runyon sprang to put a steady-
ing hand on her arm whats the mat-
ter he inquired anxiously you look
all in

  nothing kay straightened up and
smiled at him im just a little tired
i guess ill be all right as soon as i
get something to eat you go on up

to the bunkhouse and ill join you in a
minute im eating with the boys un-
til i can get my own housekeeping ar-
rangements rigged up youll stay for
supper of course she added as he
hesitated a moment

  thats mighty good of you id be
glad to only look here who was
that you were riding in with

  kay paused at the cabin door her eye-
brows raised in surprise a slight flush
came into her cheeks as she answered
his question after all there was no
point in making a mystery about being
with ted

  that was ted gaynor the man i was
with up on the ridge she answered
to her annoyance she flushed still
more as she caught tom runyons
keen speculative look at her heightened
color

  oh yes well hes just the one i
wanted to ask you about but well
wait until after supper

  before kay could answer he turned
and made for the bunkhouse

  as kay washed her face and hands
she tried to reason herself out of the
queer panicky feeling that suddenly
took possession of her the dark pre-
monition that she had had when she said
good-by to ted swept over her again

  dont be a fool she scolded her
image in the mirror as she ruthlessly
tugged a comb through her tangled
curls youre just letting your nerves
run away with you what could pos-
sibly happen to him you must keep
your head and dont let tom runyons
first suspicions start up again

  braced up by the thought that it was
up to her to protect ted kay walked
slowly up to the bunkhouse planning
in her mind just what she was going to
say any thoughts were welcome as
long as they pushed into the background
her horrible experience of the afternoon
instead of allowing herself to dwell on
that she concentrated on the memory
of the magnificent way ted had come
to the rescue

  if her first intuitive judgment of him
in spite of the damning conditions of


ranch romances

their first meeting had needed any bol-
stering up she certainly had had it
there

  from the minute he had been freed
from the desperate need of providing
for his mother and sister ted had been
a changed man kay thought back to
what he had said in that first dramatic
moment when she had held him covered
with her gun with her intuitive sym-
pathy she understood exactly how des-
peration for those he loved had driven
him to feel justified in destroying some
timber for the sake of saving human
lives

  even in his desperation he had
thought it all out with the same intelli-
gent conciseness that he had used in
planning a way out for her and follow-
ing up by saving the timberland that
she had so nearly lost by her own folly
he had been perfectly right in saying
that in burning off the ridge he had
chosen he would have done no actual
damage to anyone it would have de-
stroyed a second scrub growth of tim-
ber but it could easily have been kept
under control

  you couldnt expect any man to see
it as she did though kay realized as
she neared the bunkhouse and saw tom
runyon standing talking with seth
while they waited for the call to sup-
per especially not a man of tom run-
yons type who was obsessed with the
idea of his own importance and would
be ready to jump to any conclusion that
would reflect glory on himself

  and the demand of the community
for some action in running down the
firebug whoever he was would make
runyon all the more eager to pin the
blame for all the fires on ted if he
suspected that one mad act of his from
the consequences of which thank good-
ness she had arrived in time to save
him

  the supper bell rang just as kay
joined the two men and in the general
conversation at the table there was no
chance for runyon to ask her the ques-
tions she was prepared to parry as skil-
fully as she could talk turned on the

new scheme for building the ranch
house and everyone was full of ideas
and suggestions

  by the way seth broke in suddenly
isnt it about time ted gaynor was
getting back

  oh i meant to tell you and i for-
got kay felt tom runyons eyes on
her as she turned apologetically to seth
i-i met him on the mesa and he gave
me the option he got from old man
warren it was terribly good of you
and the boys to lend that money so he
could clinch the bargain

  she smiled at them a sudden catch
in her throat and mist in her eyes at
this proof of their loyalty to her

  why didnt he come in seth de-
manded i wanted to get all the dope
he thought hed better be getting
on again kay felt the slow color
come into her cheeks at the insistence
of tom runyons look he told me to
tell you all about it she launched into
the account ted had given her of his
interview with old man warren in the
hopes of diverting attention from her-
self

  i like that gaynor fellow seth ob-
served when she had finished just
where did you say you picked him up
kay gave a gasp at this break it was
evident that seth had forgotten all the
things she had told him to say to tom
runyon about ted and he couldnt have
put his foot in it any worse if he had
deliberately tried than by this question
she could see tom runyons ears
pricked up to catch her answer al-
though he pretended to be engrossed
in conversation with one of the boys

  managing to change her gasp into a
cough kay fixed her eyes firmly on seth
as she answered why ive told you
about him before seth you dont pay
attention to what i say half the time
under her teasing tone her voice held
a significant reminder hes the one
who has been helping me decide on
some of the timberland ive been want-
ing to buy even before the house burned
down

  she turned to tom runyon with a
fire frenzy



politely explanatory air as she said
ive been thinking we ought to add
some more timberland to the ranch
theres nothing much but scrub
growth on that ridge where i met you
he observed

  thats just the conclusion ted ar-
rived at kay looked up at tom run-
yon with flattering admiration im
sorry he isnt here you and he would
enjoy talking together

  wheres he gone

  just yesterday he decided to really
join up with the outfit kay explained
and hes gone back to bring his mother
and sister to the other little cabin like
mine

  i see tom runyons looks belied
his words kay realized nervously as his
black eyes fastened themselves specula-
tively on her

  hes the one who has got us started
with this idea of building the ranch
house and barn ourselves she rattled
on so its lucky he is a regular mem-
ber of the outfit now

  sure is seth agreed heartily push-
ing back his chair and rising to his feet
well need all the hands we can get
on this job

  there was a rattle and creaking of
chairs as the others followed suit

  how about taking me on- tom
runyon suggested with a flattering eye
bent on kay

  youre too valuable right where you
are she countered gayly im count-
ing on you to keep my new timberland
from burning down

 thats right tom runyon
promptly succumbed to kays flattery
and with a relieved feeling that she had
safely steered him away from the dan-
gerous interest he was manifesting in
ted kay sauntered out into the twi-
light with him

  her relief however was short-lived
mo sooner had they stepped out of the
mess shack than tom runyon took pos-
sessive hold of her arm saying

  how about that little talk we were
going to have

  all right said kay resignedly as

she allowed herself to be guided down
to the cabin

chapter xvi

strange news

marshaling her wits to meet
the coming interview kay
walked the short distance from the
bunkhouse to the cabin in silence she
felt that she would give anything to be
rid of tom runyon and have a chance
to rest after her momentous and ex-
hausting day but some instinct warned
her that it would be foolish to let him
go away with the suspicion that she
could see he still harbored against ted
tired as she was she would have to
change his line of thought or he might
make trouble

  shall ve sit out here kay sank
down on the top step and leaned back
against the post that held the rail of the
tiny porch in place

  sure

  kay couldnt quite read the look in
tom runyons dark eyes as he gazed at
her her thoughts suddenly flew to
those luminous black eyes of teds so
different from the ones bent on her now
teds eyes had a light that seemed to
come from within while toms were
just black and round and staring but
no whit less intent

  you make some picture there do you
know it said tom fervently

  kay smiled a faint response to his
admiration

  i dont feel much like a picture she
admitted im terribly tired

  ill bet you are he put one foot
on the lower step and leaned toward
her his elbow resting on his knee im
not going to keep you but i just want
to get one or two things straightened
out in my mind just how long have
you known this ted gaynor

 goodness i never can remember
dates but it seems as though id known
him for ages on the other hand i
feel as though id known you quite a
long time and we met only yesterday
kay glanced up at him from under her


ranch romances

dark lashes with deliberate coquetry

  i certainly feel that way about
you tom runyon gave a flattered
laugh adding say what is it about you
that keeps a fellow looking at you and
forgetting what he wants to say

  kay laughed why say anything
she asked demurely its too lovely
here in the twilight to be asking ques-
tions i know what i would like to
have you tell me though she added
as an afterthought

  what he was all eager attention
tell me something about your work
as fire patrol have you done it before
you came here

  sure i have he cleared his throat
with a pleased air of superiority thats
why the protective association sent for
me to come up here and see if i couldnt
get to the bottom of these mysterious
fires ive been handling a situation a
whole lot like this in wyoming and be-
lieve me i ran that firebug to earth
tell me about it kay fixed him
with her eyes full of a flattering inquiry

  well it was this way tom runyon
settled back and kay was just breath-
ing a sigh of relief at having success-
fully side-tracked him from the subject
of ted gaynor when he leaned forward
once more and broke in abruptly on his
narrative

  before i get going on that i want
to clear up my mind about this gay-
nor guy he looked keenly at kay
did he tell you about the fight he had
today

  kay looked at him with startled eyes
how could tom runyon possibly have
found out about the fight on the mesa
fight she echoed in a faint tone
so he didnt tell you tom ex-
claimed i had a hunch he wouldnt
kay looked at him with startled eyes
amazement what under the sun was
he driving at if tom runyon knew
about the fight at all he must know
that she had been there and had seen
the whole thing but there was no pos-
sible way for him to know he had
come to the ranch from the opposite
direction so he couldnt have come

across scrap johnson when the puncher
came to and have heard about it from
him

  i dont understand what youre talk-
ing about kay said finally are you
sure he was in a fight

  sure as shooting tom runyon as-
sured her the guy that came out to
relieve me saw the whole thing

  but he couldnt have kay burst
out then hastily tried to cover up her
break i mean he must be mixing ted
up with someone else

  not on your life he wasnt tom
declared positively he was right
there in kellys joint when it happened
kellys joint kay echoed in a re-
lieved tone as a light suddenly burst
on her oh that wasnt ted he
was waiting for me outside the bank
and i remember now he did say some-
thing about having seen a fracas of some
kind down at kellys

  seen it tom scoffed ill say he
saw it he was the one who started
it

 but-how-why- kay bit her lip
and broke off short the last thing she
wanted to do was to discuss ted and
she still felt sure that tom runyon was
mistaken

 thats just what i mean tom
leaned forward and shook his finger im-
pressively at her theres a lot you
dont know about that gaynor guy
tom runyon was so positive that kay
felt it would be better to sift this rumor
to the bottom

  he was fighting with a fellow named
scrap johnson about some girl or
other tom answered i reckon thats
why he wasnt so keen about mention-
ing it to you

  his tone had a malicious edge but
kay hardly heard it her mind was
flashing back to the events of the morn-
ing it might have been possible while
she had been in the bank for this thing
to have happened she had been so pre-
occupied with her own troubles when
she came out of the bank that she had
not noticed ted particularly

  she suddenly remembered something
fire frenzy



ted had said when he had announced
on the mesa that-he meant to fight scrap
johnson he had said he was going
to give him a second lesson kay-
had noticed this remark at the time
with a wondering conjecture but in the
fast-moving events afterwards she had
forgotten it

  yeah the two of em had it out hot
and heavy kay suddenly came back
to the present and toms droning voice
as he recounted the event the way it
had been told to him everybody
thought this scrap fellow was going to
lick the stuffing out of him but gaynor
got him down by a trick twist then
he threatened hed kill him if he ever
heard him mention his girls name
again

  tom paused to let this piece of infor-
mation sink in his eyes never leaving
kays face as he watched her reaction
to this unexpected news

  feeling his gaze on her kay steeled
herself to hide her surprise and confu-
sion it seemed impossible with all that
had passed between them since that
ted shouldnt have mentioned it to her
the only conclusion to be drawn was
that he had kept still because he hadnt
wanted her to know that he had been
fightng about some girl pride came
to kays aid and helped her to conceal
the hurt feeling that teds lack of con-
fidence gave her

  there was no reason why he should
have mentioned it if he didnt want to
she observed lightly perhaps as long
as he won out he might have thought
it would have seemed like boasting

  he probably wont mind boasting
about it to the black-haired beauty he
was fighting for tom chuckled as
he scanned kays expression for her re-
action to this remark

  black-haired how do you know
she was black-haired the involuntary
question burst out before kay could
stop it

  because scrap johnson had said
something about a black-haired filly
tom runyon went on deliberately giv-
ing a garbled account of the information

he had received his eyes narrowing as
he observed the flush that spread over
kays cheek thats what started the
fight he finished

  well he evidently had his reasons
for not mentioning it kay tried to
speak lightly and indifferently but
something seemed suddenly to give way
inside her so that she felt she couldnt
possibly go on with this conversation
whatever the consequences of uncere-
moniously dismissing tom runyon she
simply had to be alone

  she abruptly stood up and held out
her hand

  im afraid ill have to say good
night with the greatest effort of will
kay kept her voice from trembling
ive had a strenuous day and i guess
i havent entirely got over the shock of
yesterday

  poor little girl tom runyons
voice was a trifle over-sympathetic as
he took her hand in both of his and
bent his face close to her you go and
get a good sleep and any time you need
any help you call on tom runyon
just you forget about this investigating
business leave that all to me

  thanks kay murmured smiling
faintly at him as she drew her hand
away i hope youll come over any
time you feel like it

 trust me tom runyon boomed
heartily then he added with heavy
gallantry youre going to be seeing a
whole lot of me young lady and dont
you forget it

  feeling her powers of resistance grad-
ually giving way to the weak dizzy sen-
sation that was overcoming her kay
turned without further ceremony and
bolted into her cabin with a half smile
of satisfaction on his lips tom runyon
strode off to the bunkhouse

      chapter xvii
      turning the tables

it was a good half hour after kay and
ted had left him on the mesa be-
fore scrap johnson came back to con-
sciousness stirring painfully he tried


ranch romances

to sit up then fell back as he felt him-
self constrained by the ropes that bound
him he swore to himself while he
strained against his bonds and gave a
snarl of satisfaction as he felt them give
slightly alternately resting and work-
ing to loosen the knots in the rope he
finally cleared himself and staggered to
his feet

  his jaws aching and his face ugly
with rage he slowly started back to the
flying six on foot he had not gone
far when he saw a cloud of dust in the
distance and emerging from it the fig-
ure of a horseman coming towards him
at a full gallop his jaw set as he rec-
ognized josh hastings and his hand
made an instinctive grab for his gun
a savage oath burst out as he encoun-
tered the empty holster

  scrap had no illusions as to the recep-
tion he would get from his boss failure
was the one thing for which josh hast-
ings had no patience or sympathy and
his fiery temper when he was thwarted
was something to reckon with

  whats the meaning of this josh
plastings pulled his plunging mount to
a sliding halt as he came abreast of the
plodding puncher wheres your cay-
use and wheres that option i sent
you to get

  resentment flared into scrap john-
sons eyes and in his reckless mood and
rage it was well for josh hastings that
his holster was empty

you were too damn slow scrap
johnson snarled they beat you to it
a dark flush came over josh hast-
ings florid face and he ripped out an
oath

  you mean you let kay crandon get
there ahead of you

  sure i didnt scrap answered sul-
lenly i stopped her all right but
when i got to old man warren i found
one of her punchers a guy named gay-
nor had got there ahead of me and
bought up the ridge you wanted and an
option on the rest

  hastings exploded into a string of
oaths the foxy little filly he raged
then broke off short and looked keenly

at scrap what do you mean about
stopping her where is she

  a reckless disregard of consequences
suddenly possessed scrap he was
slated to be fired anyway so he
might as well get all the revenge he
could

  wouldnt you like to know he
jeered ive beaten you to it with
those red lips anyway and believe
me they aint waiting around for you
that same gaynor guy came up and
caught me off guard damn him but ill
get even yet he gave a wild in-
coherent laugh at hastings expression
some rival youve got there he
ended and is she sweet on him oh
boy

  shut up you drunken fool josh
hastings reached over and grabbed
johnsons shoulder with an iron grip
give me this whole thing straight

  youve got the whole thing straight
enough scrap wrenched himself
away im resigning from your outfit
anyway here and now

  resigning like hell josh hastings
roared youre fired and the quicker
you vamoose from this range the bet-
ter

  this dont seem to be my popular
day scrap johnson swaggered inso-
lently your sweethearts boy friend
threatened to kill me the next time he
saw me maybe you can figure why
he taunted

  a look of cunning flashed into his
face at an idea that suddenly struck
him and he reeled over close to josh
hastings mount where his eye had
caught sight of a gun in the saddle
pocket before josh hastings could
recover from his renewed conviction
that he was dealing with a drunken
man scrap had grabbed the gun and
covered him with a lightning draw

  hist em there was nothing drunk
about scraps tone now and josh hast-
ings dropped his reins and reluctantly
obeyed

  seein as how im through with this
range anyway ill make my exit in
style scrap sneered suppose you
fire frenzy



untasten that belt of yours and toss it
over here

  youll pay for this good and plenty
josh hastings raged as he obeyed

  im not sticking around to make
any payments scrap observed he
stooped to pick up the belt vith its
holster and gun attached with his left
hand never taking his eyes from josh
hastings however or shifting his aim

  hooking the belt over his arm scrap
reached over and grabbed the bridle of
his victims mount

  get down he ordered his gun un-
erringly trained on his former boss
now vamoose yourself he ended
ferociously when this last command
had been obeyed you can have that
hike back instead of me

  as josh hastings hesitated scrap
shifted his aim the fraction of an inch
and fired a shot that nipped the brim
of his victims stetson thus sending it
spinning to the ground

  without waiting for a further re-
minder josh hastings turned away and
headed for the flying six spluttering
with inarticulate rage after watching
him for a second scrap johnson swung
into the saddle and headed at a gallop
for the distant blue ridges of the bitter
root mountains

chapter xviii

a gruesome discovery

by the time josh hastings reached
home his rage was no longer in-
articulate but it was none the less in-
tense in the two hours during which
he had indulged in the unaccustomed
exercise of trudging painfully across
tho hard sun-baked surface of the
range he had had plenty of time to
face the bitter truth that he had been
made a fool of not only by his former
cowhand but by kay crandon as well

 just when he had seemingly had
everything in his own hands the tables
had been turned and he was now ap-
parently farther than ever from accom-
plishing his ends the appearance of
ted gaynor on the scene particularly

enraged him and the taunting hints
that scrap johnson had thrown out
about his being kays boy friend
made him see red

  the thought of any rival was intoler-
able but the idea that the man whom
he believed he had put down once and
for all in the past should come back to
challenge him was an added outrage
with this thought and fury at scrap
johnson alternately uppermost in his
mind josh hastings found himself
cherishing two distinct plans of re-
venge

  first of all he meant to make his
former puncher pay through the nose
for his insolence and his plan here was
definite and drastic although it had to
be handled with care he had no idea
of telling the whole story of his plight
and being the laughing stock of the
range so this prevented him from call-
ing the sheriff to his aid and following
scrap johnson up with a posse

 he had a hunch that scrap was
headed for the idaho state line and
that he planned to make his getaway
over the only pass that led over the
bitter root from this region

  if he followed right after him there
was a good chance of overtaking him
scrap johnson would be pretty sure to
figure that his one-time boss would
rather lose his mount and call it quits
on the situation than let the story leak
out of the fix his cowhand had landed
him in therefore he wouldnt feel
pressed for time and it would be a
fairly easy matter to catch up with him

  and there wont be any doubt about
wholl have the drop this time josh
hastings thought voiced itself aloud
with a malignant intensity of tone that
boded ill for scrap johnson when that
moment should come

  he stooped down to ease the heel of
his boot then limped along with a
groan

  hell pay for that damn blister too
he muttered savagely as he forged
ahead his eyes squinting into the dis-
tance for a glimpse of the scattered
buildings of the flying six


ranch romances

  finally they loomed in sight and
josh hastings slowed up as he planned
his campaign of action then regard-
less of his blistered feet he broke into
a run for a nearby coulee he had no
time to lose if he were going to make
the lower corral and get a horse with-
out being seen

  when he had left the ranch to follow
scrap johnson he had announced that
he might spend the night in town so
no one was expecting him right now
the boys would be either in the mess
shack or gathered around waiting for
the supper call so here was his chance
for a safe getaway

  following the coulee he came at last
to the lower corral which was hidden
from the ranch buildings and a good
three hundred yards distant from the
upper corral there he roped himself
a horse quickly saddled him and rode
back through the coulee which shel-
tered him from view giving the ranch
house a wide berth he headed off for
the mountains at a run

  it was over an hour later when hast-
ings reached the trail that eventually
led to the pass across the divide

  the last streams of color from the
afterglow of the sunset were fading
into light pinks and lavenders and
twilight was well under way as he
started up the climb between the living
walls of pines only the faintest light
penetrated through the thick branches
that interlaced overhead but josh
hastings pushed on his lust for re-
venge still strong upon him

  there would be a moon later to
guide him through the pass in the sad-
dle of the divides defile if he had not
overtaken his victim by that time but
he figured on coming upon him before
he reached the central divide urging
his horse on he finally emerged from
the heavily timbered slope of the east-
ern divide he topped the ridge and
plunged down to the shallow valley
that lay between it and the central
divide

  after he quickly crossed the valley
josh hastings rode his mount on up the

scantily timbered slope the light of
the rising moon gradually spread over
the whole landscape and by the time
hastings reached the crest of the pass
it was high in the heavens

  just beyond the saddle of rock was a
small grassy plateau which harbored
the spring-fed stream from whose mys-
terious depths water flowed in both
directions part seeking the bitter
root river in montana and part flow-
ing to the clear water river in idaho

  as hastings neared this strange spot
his mount plunged restively and in-
stead of making for the inviting water
that gleamed ahead in the moonlight
he balked and tried to whirl back and
head through the pass again steady-
ing him and driving on with a sharp
cut of his quirt josh hastings reached
the small grassy meadow that bordered
the stream

  as he peered ahead through the
moonlight he made out a strange
hunched form lying by the edge of the
water he swung his mount sharply at
right angles and headed him away
from his gruesome discovery dis-
mounting at some little distance he
came back on foot to investigate a baf-
fled sense of rage rising in him at the
thought of being cheated of his re-
venge

  when he turned the inert figure over
he let out a startled oath as he gazed at
the deadly white face thus exposed to
the moonlight instead of the pinched
features of scrap johnson that he had
expected to see the still face of ted
gaynor in its frame of glossy black
hair stared up at him

chapter xix
revenge

recoiling in the first surprise of
finding his other enemy so unex-
pectedly delivered into his hands josh
hastings stared back at the seemingly
dead face for a long moment then he
dropped on his knees and felt teds
heart

  a grunt of disappointment escaped
fire frenzy



him as he detected a faint beat but
after examining the wound that gaped
in the fallen mans chest a grim smile
of satisfaction flickered for a moment
on his lips

  reckon a good enough jobs been
done on you after all he observed
callously as he rose to his feet and
stooped down to pull some grass to
wipe the blood off his hands scrap
johnsons saved me some trouble there
all right

  he scanned the ground carefully
walking back and forth in an ever wid-
ening semi-circle around the wounded
man looks like he got a shot from
ambush he mused aloud as he failed
to find any traces of footprints or
trampled grass

  hello whats this he stopped
short and bent down to examine a large
flat stone that harbored a strange dark
spot on its rough gray surface

  josh hastings experimentally stuck
his finger on it and exploded into an
oath as he pulled it back covered with
a sticky red stain

  begins to look more like a duel

  he leaned down close and found sev-
eral more dark spots leading away
from the stone following them he
came to some trampled grass and with
growing excitement he followed in the
tracks after going fifty feet or so he
came at last on the object of his search
a dark form lay in the underbrush by
the edge of the grassy spot and this
time as josh hastings leaned close to
identify this second victim he saw the
man he had expected to find in the first
place

  a brief examination showed him to
be far less seriously wounded than ted
gaynor he had evidently fainted from
loss of blood from a flesh wound in his
arm but his pulse and his heart were
strong an ugly look twisted josh
hastings mouth as he stood looking
down at the man he had pursued with
such ruthless intent for vengeance a
cunning gleam came into his eyes as he
glanced back to where ted gaynor lay

  it was easy enough to reconstruct

what had happened scrap johnson had
undoubtedly won the draw and fired
first and gaynors shot had gone wild
first catching by chance the fleshy part
of johnsons arm

  there wasnt a doubt in josh hast-
ings mind that ted gaynor was done
for but just in case he might by some
miracle pull through why not frame
him so that suspicion of what josh
was about to do would be forever
pinned on this enemy of his

  he now had the chance to fix things
so that no question would ever be
raised about how scrap johnson met
his end dead or alive ted gaynor
would be held responsible working
his dastardly plot out step by step josh
hastings took off his bandanna and
wrapped it carefully about his hand
then he went swiftly back to where
ted gaynor lay

  he bent down and loosened the fin-
gers of the hand that still gripped the
gun that kay had given to ted hold-
ing it with the bandanna so that no
touch of incriminating fingerprints could
get on it josh hastings slowly drew it
from the loosened grip

  suddenly and without any warning
he felt teds dark eyes on him then as
suddenly again the lids dropped and
the body he was bending over was as
inert and lifeless as before doubting
the evidence of his own senses but with
his heart pounding suffocatingly in his
ears at the memory of that strangely
seeing look from those dark eyes josh
hastings held himself rigidly still

  the weird beauty of the scene was
lost on him but something of the eerie
quality of that mysterious spot from
which waters eventually flowed to the
atlantic and the pacific made his breath
come quicker and raised a momentary
panic in him as he stared at ted gay-
nors white face he watched for any
further sign of life but it lay still as
death in the moonlight

  hastings breath came more normally
again while he was cursing himself
for a fool he lifted up teds gun and
walked halfway back toward scrap

johnson where he took careful aim and
fired the shot reverberated from the
rocky walls of the pass behind him in-
tensified by the silence so that it
sounded like the blast of a cannon
there was a convulsive jerk of scrap
johnsons body and a dark spot appeared
in his temple and slowly spread

  ted gaynor lay as before completely
remote from this scene of violence he
seemed as dead as the man who had just
been murdered dropping the gun from
which he had fired the fatal shot josh
hastings knelt down and deliberately
crawled back to the spot where ted
gaynor lay

  hastings rose to his feet and looked
back critically over the trail he had
beaten through the grass he could see
teds gun gleaming where he had let it
fall and a cruel smile twisted his lips
dead or alive he had framed ted gay-
nor whoever found the two bodies
could not escape the inference of that
dropped gun at one stroke he had been
able not only to get his revenge on
scrap but to wipe ted gaynor from his
path

 no matter what kay might have
thought of ted she was not the kind
to let her thoughts linger over a proved
murderer from now on the way with
kay should be clear sailing walking
slowly over to his horse josh hastings
swung into the saddle and headed back
toward the pass

shelter

the moon hung low in the western
sky and moonlight and dawn were
mingled in a cold gray light before
ted gaynor opened his eyes again for
a long interval he lay staring straight
ahead his eyes darkened with pain
gradually the gentle trickle of the water
penetrated to his consciousness and he
was suddenly aware of his burning
throat and the fever that blazed through
him

  he tried to pull himself over to the
water but fell back with a groan at the

intolerable pain in his chest a wild
look came into his eyes and he mut-
tered incoherently slumping down
again by the water that was so near
and yet so far he seemed on the point
of giving up finally with a mighty ef-
fort he roused himself and rolled over
so that he could reach the edge of the
stream

  as he sucked in a great gulp of the
life-giving drink teds mind cleared for
a moment and he realized where he was
and what had happened in his third en-
counter with scrap johnson on his way
over to the clear water basin he had
dismounted to get a drink at the head-
waters of the pass and just as he was
in the act of quenching his thirst he
heard a rasping challenge behind him
whirling about and drawing at the same
time he had seen scrap johnson a short
distance away

  the next instant there had been the
roar and blaze of two guns but scrap
johnsons bullet reached its mark first
while teds went wild from that point
memory registered nothing but a blank
void shot through with intolerable pain
and nightmare dreams doubtless scrap
johnson had ridden on and left him to

die

  all details of the night blurred into
delirium as the pain in his chest swept
over him again but although the de-
lirium persisted he did not lose con-
sciousness through it all ran a sub-
conscious will to live a determination
to pull through for kays sake she
needed him he mustnt fail her

  by a gigantic efforts and propelled by
this inner insistent force ted pulled
himself up on his hands and knees and
began slowly and painfully to drag
himself along the edge of the stream

  two thoughts possessed him above
all others he mustnt lose the trail of
the water he must stay by it so that
he could quench the thirst that burned
in him and he mustnt let himself re-
lax and lie down once he did that
he would never get up again

  gradually the dawn lightened and
when the first rays of the sun glistened
fire frenzy



on the headwaters of the bitter root
and clear water rivers ted had man-
aged to drag himself five hundred yards
or more through the scrub pines that
dotted the southeastern slope of the
divide

  at the point of exhaustion but still
pushed on by that mysterious will to
live that functioned without any con-
scious control he pushed on to a small
clearing that appeared unexpectedly
through the trees

  at the far end of it was a tumbled-
down and apparently deserted shack
making for it in a blind instnct to
reach shelter ted struggled over to this
goal muttering in incoherent delirium
as he approached there was a slight
movement behind the shuttered win-
dow and the next minute a figure ap-
peared in the broken-down doorway

  for a terrified second the girl in the
doorway and the exhausted and delir-
ious man stared at each other the girl
clutched the sagging wooden frame of
the door her brown eyes wide and her
dark hair in sharp contrast to her face
which showed up without an ounce of
color in her startled surprise of the
moment

  the amazement in her look gradually
changed to concern as she took in teds
desperate plight and with a cry of pity
she ran over to him and stooped down
to try to help him with a convulsive
effort ted struggled to straighten up
but he immediately sank back uncon-
scious

  her first terrified surprise over the
girl proved herself equal to the emer-
gency facing her she could not have
been more than eighteen but she had a
wiry strength in her tall slender frame
half carrying half dragging ted she
managed to get him to the door of the
shack the early morning sun had
gradually become obscured by dark
clouds that piied up in the east and
threatened a sudden dov-npour

  after one glance at the lowering sky
the girl darted inside the tiny enclosure
and quickly made up the cot on which
she had evidently spent the night then

with one last mighty effort she pulled
ted inside and managed to lift him onto
the cot just as the first heavy drops of
the storm splashed on the roof

  panting from her exertion she leaned
back a moment against the wall and
studied the face of the man she had
brought in evidently reassured by
what she saw she dropped to her knees
with a murmur of pity and expertly ex-
amined his wound the girl rose to
her feet and took a basin which she
filled with water pulling a clean cloth
out from the drawer of a rude wash-
stand in one corner she deftly proceeded
to wash teds wound

  the rain gathering with the swift in-
tensity of mountain storms beat a wild
tattoo on the roof and gusts of wind
shook the tiny shelter to its founda-
tions however the girl was oblivious
to the outside elements as she bent with
absorbed attention to her battle with
death

waiting

kay waked up with a start as a
ray of the early morning sun
slanted through her cabin window and
shone insistently in her eyes

  thank goodness the suns out at
last she glanced out the window then
snuggled down in bed agan to indulge
in a few moments of tempting day
dreams

  it was the third day since ted had
left and kay planned with happy ex-
citement the way she would greet him
when he arrived with his mother and
sister she had recovered from her hurt
feeling at the news tom runyon had
brought of teds first fight with scrap
johnson whatever reasons he had had
for not telling her she was going to give
him the benefit of the doubt and wait
until he was ready to tell her

  kay smiled drowsily to herself one
thing she was sure of he hadnt been
thinking of any dark-haired girl when
he had said good-by to her and some-
how she knew that he wasnt going to

waste any time getting back to her

  during the storm that had raged for
the last two days kay had busied her-
self getting the extra cabin ready for
teds mother and sister it had been
furnished in a rough sort of way and by
picking out odds and ends from the
bunkhouse and using some of the few
things that had been saved from the
fire kay had contrived to make it quite
home-like

  babs had ridden over once in the
downpour to report that all was well at
the flying six and that aunt kate and
she were in no hurry to leave their pres-
ent quarters a frown puckered kays
forehead as her thoughts shifted from
ted to the situation at the flying six
it was galling to be accepting josh
hastings hospitality for members of
her family even if she wasnt accepting
it for herself

  she hadnt seen him since that visit
when she had told him of her plans
with such near-disastrous consequences
one good thing at least had come out
of it she had positive proof now that
josh hastings was working against her
the doubtful point was whether or not
he knew that she was aware of his ef-
forts to get the timberland away from
her

  unless scrap johnson had gone back
and reported what had happened josh
hastings would have no way of know-
ing whether or not kay had known of
his plot and kay had a hunch that
scrap johnson wouldnt be any too eager
to describe that afternoons events to
his boss he would be much more
likely to realize that his usefulness on
this range was over and to clear out
without any embarrassing expla-
nations

  in that case at least while aunt kate
and babs were under his roof it would
be best to pretend ignorance of josh
hastings real attitude toward her also
it would be easier to keep her eye on
him if she didnt let matters come to an
open break jumping out of bed with a
sudden desire to express her excited an-
ticipation by action kay hurriedly

dressed and ran up to the mess shack
for breakfast

  ted and his family probably wouldnt
arrive before noon anyway but there
was still a number of finishing touches
that she wanted to put on the cabin
giving an involuntary skip of sheer joy
of living at the beauty of the morning
kay drew in a long breath of the in-
vigorating air after the two-day down-
pour everything was so fresh and glis-
tening that it must be a good omen

  the morning flew past and by noon
kay had the cabin completely finished
and shining brightly for its new occu-
pants she had a guilty feeling that she
should have ridden over to see aunt
kate instead of devoting her whole
morning to the pleasant excitement of
getting ready for ted but she eased her
conscience by the thought that she
would go over after the arrival of the
newcomers so that she could tell aunt
kate all about them

  all during lunch kay had an ear out
for the pounding of hoofs and the rattle
of the livery buckboard from red river
but the quiet of the mesa was undis-
turbed

  the afternoon wore on and by four
oclock kay found herself nervous and
irritable with disappointment if she
waited any longer it would be too late
to ride over to see aunt kate and shed
never hear the end of it if she let all
of the day go past without seeing her

  on the other hand shed be sure to
miss ted if she started off now art-
lessly persuading herself that it would
be very rude not to be there to greet
teds mother and sister and that see-
ing ted himself had nothing to do with
it kay hung around

  finally at six oclock when the mesa
bell clanged out kay reluctantly ad-
mitted that they werent going to arrive
that day at supper she was silent and
abstracted dwelling in her thoughts
rather than in the conversation going
on about her suddenly she was aware
that seth was speaking to her

  what did you say seth she came
to with a start
fire frenzy



  gosh you must be getting deaf
seth grumbled ive been asking you
about six times when you expected gay-
nor back i thought it was today

  it was kay answered but some-
thing must have happened to delay him
im sure hell be here tomorrow
heres hoping seth growled we
cant let any grass grow under our feet
getting that bam started im going to
start cutting timber tomorrow whether
hes back or not

  hell be here kay predicted confi-
dently she paused a moment at the
door c the shack and looked out isnt
it great after the rain

  ill say it is seth agreed the
equinox must have got kind of mixed
up this year to give us that storm so
early but i aint kicking none makes
the danger of fire just that much less
kay nodded absent-mindedly to this
remark then she sauntered down to
the corral and whistled flicker to her
obeying a sudden impulse she got him
out and saddled him after she had rid-
den up to her cabin for her sweater she
headed out onto the mesa

  deciding to kill two birds with one
stone and ride the restlessness out of
her system by going over to see aunt
kate kay started off for the flying six
at a brisk gait

  it would be moonlight by nine oclock
she reflected and she could easily be
back by eleven if she didnt go now
shed simply have to go tomorrow and
then shed miss being there when ted
arrived darkness had fallen when kay
clattered up to the flying six ranch
house at her whoopee babs and ruth
came dashing out to meet her dis-
mounting she met them at the foot of
the steps and they all three burst into
the living rrr together their arms in-
tertwined

  well well bless me if you dont all
look the same aie josh hastings got
up and came tovrard them though he
addressed the vhcle trio his eyes were
fixed on kay with her bright eyes and
flushed cheeks framed in a tousled mop
of auburn curls

-ranch romances-first sept

  kay instantly straightened up and
smoothed her hair it was all she could
do to repress the angry contempt and
scorn she felt for this man who had
tried by such sneaking means to get
the best of her but she realized that
for the moment at least she must act
as though nothing had happened to
change her usual attitude toward him

  whereve you been all day aunt
kates querulous question broke the
awkward moment and kay turned to
her with relief

  i was terribly sorry not to get over
sooner she apologized as she con-
tritely went over and kissed her aunt
but i was waiting around for ted gay-
nor to come back with his mother and
sister

  a curious pause followed these words
and something made kay glance up
keenly at josh hastings his eyes were
narrowed on her with an enigmatic
stare and a half smile twisted his lips
into a sinister line kay felt a cold un-
reasoning clutch at her spine and it was
with the greatest difficulty that she re-
pressed the involuntary shudder that
contracted her muscles

  the memory of that premonition she
had had when ted said good-by to her
flashed over her again but she sternly
ignored it no matter what josh hast-
ings had tried to do to her she couldnt
blame him for teds failure to appear
she at least had to be fair enough to
admit that

  i reckon youve made a mistake tak-
ing on that man and a whole parcel of
relatives aunt kate broke through the
strained moment itll be a good thing
if he doesnt show up at all

  josh hastings let out a great guffaw
trust aunt kate to hit the nail on the
head he exclaimed with indulgent
appreciation shes said a mouth-
ful

  sure i have aunt kate agreed com-
placently a pleased smile on her lips
at the flattery of her hosts glance

  perhaps i have made a mistake
kay obeyed a sudden wicked impulse
and added if they arent coming you


ranch romances

and babs could come back now and
have that cabin

  well seein youve promised it to
them i reckon youll have to see it
through

  kay smiled at aunt kates hurried
change of tactics as she saw herself
transferred from the comfort of her pres-
ent quarters to the rigors of pioneer
life in a cabin

  how about that timberland you were
thinking of buying the last time you
were here josh hastings tone was
elaborately careless as he put this ques-
tion but his eyes were alert as he stud-
ied kays expression to try to discover
whether or not scrap johnson had told
her what his errand to town that day
had been

  the fact that kay had come over to
the flying six would seem to indicate
that she had not discovered his effort
to double-cross her but josh hastings
was eager to get this point cleared up
if scrap had told her hed have quite a
bit of explaining to do and he had a
plausible yarn all ready but if she
knew nothing about it his best line was
to let well enough alone

  oh yes i was telling you about
that kay met his glance with wide-
eyed innocence i bought it up in
fact one of my punchers was in town
attending to it for me that afternoon i
was here didnt i mention it

  no you didnt josh hastings ef-
forts to conceal his feelings were less
successful than kays and she smiled
inwardly with wicked satisfaction at his
disgusted tone

  well if you take my advice youll
sell out while youve got a chance
aunt kate put in her word josh
hastings here is giving you the best
offer youre likely to get

  perhaps kay turned to the door
to hide the flash of anger she felt against
her aunt for being such an easy tool in
josh hastings hands ill have to be
getting back now

  im going with you josh hastings
announced

  no you mustnt kay expostulated

angry at herself for not having fore-
seen this outcome of her visit id
rather go alone its moonlight and im
not the least bit afraid

  thats not the point josh hast-
ings reached up for his hat and coat
im doing this for my own pleasure

  realizing that she was fairly caught
and that to protest any further would
be to attach undue importance to the
situation kay gave in as gracefully as
she could and after saying good night
to babs and her aunt the two started
off together

        chapter xxii
        trapped again

for some time kay and josh hast-
ings rode through the moonlight
without saying anything as he had in-
sisted on coming kay decided to leave
the burden of the conversation to him
and the magic of the night inevitably
drew her thoughts to ted

  the long rolling reaches of the mesa
stretched out in a silver radiance before
them broken only by ghostly clumps of
brush with their weird twisted shad-
ows lengthening in the moonlight if
only ted had come when he had said he
would she would be taking this ride
with him instead of josh hastings kay
reflected with a renewed wave of dis-
appointment as though reading her
thoughts her companion suddenly broke
the long silence chiming in with what
she was thinking with an uncanny in-
sight

 your aunt kate was right about
that gaynor guy kay his tone was
full of a friendly protection there are
a few things i want to tell you about
him and then i think youll agree with
her

  yes kay waited non-committally
for what he had to say although her
eyes held a hostile disbelief of anything
it might be

  im surprised that hed have the
nerve to come to any range where he
knew i was josh hastings went on
but i reckon he wont stay long even
fire frenzy



if he does show up-which i doubt
  why asked kay interestedly

  josh hastings hesitated then brought
out with a show of reluctance its an
ugly story but i think you ought to
know it for your own protection when
i had my ranch over in the clear water
basin this gaynor was punching for
old man gage of the x bar l he was
involved in a rustling raid of his boss
cattle and the shooting of his son he
paused a moment then added there
was a girl mixed up in it too but i
wont go into that

  you may as well give me the whole
story now youve started kays voice
was coldly unconvinced and josh hast-
ings flared up at her implied disbelief

  just a pretty case of promising to
marry the girl and then deserting her
josh hastings shot a sidelong look at
kay to get her reaction to this news
and as he caught the quick look of sur-
prised unbelief he added she com-
mitted suicide

  how do you know that ted gaynor
was responsible for her committing
suicide kay demanded hotly the
story was certainly ugly but she found
it impossible to associate it with ted
he couldnt have been guilty of a thing
like that it sounded much more like
the sort of thing of which josh hastings
himself would be capable

  it was common talk hastings an-
swered her indignant question with a
more tolerant tone i dont wonder
you are startled but now you can see
the probable reason for his disappear-
ance he knew youd hear his story
sooner or later from me and figured
hed better clear out while the going
was good

  for several moments they rode on in
silence then kay said slowly im cer-
tainly not going to condemn anyone
by common talk and rumor you ought
to have something more tangible to go
on before you spread a story like that
to ruin a mans reputation

  josh hastings gave a short laugh i
must say your confidence in me isnt
any too flattering

  would you repeat that story to ted
gaynors face kay demanded

  sure i would but dont worry i
wont have to hastings sneered
take my word for it that talk about
showing up again with his mother and
sister was all one grand bluff

  kay made no answer but she touched
flicker with her heel and set a sharper
pace for home she didnt for one min-
ute believe josh hastings story but
she was animated by a sudden impera-
tive desire to get rid of his hateful
presence

  whats the hurry he pounded up
beside her and reaching over put a
possessive hand on her arm its a
crime to go rushing through a moon-
light night at this pace slow down
and ill promise not to tell you any
more sordid stories

  kays only answer vas to shake her
arm free and urge flicker on to greater
speed an ugly look settled on josh
hastings face as he was forced by her
action to follow suit flicker was a
faster horse than his and he had no
more time for talking if he was going
to keep up

  already he was losing ground a bit
and as kay glanced over her shoulder
and saw him falling behind a reckless
spirit of mischief overcame her pru-
dence she knew it was a silly thing
to rouse his temper but she couldnt
resist the temptation to pay him back
for telling her that story about ted

  realizing perfectly that nothing was
more galling to a mans pride than to
be left behind by a girl she deliber-
ately pushed flicker to the limit and
streaked ahead of him

  she had arrived at the corral turned
flicker loose and was just starting
back to her cabin when hastings came
pounding up he pulled up so sharply
that his horse slipped to its haunches
and almost went down the next in-
stant he was off and before kay could
guess his intention he seized her in
his arms and pressed his lips savagely
to hers

  thatll teach you not to play mon-


ranch romances

key tricks with me his voice was
thick with rage and passion as he held
kays shoulders in an iron grip and
bent his face close to hers youd bet-
ter learn it now because i mean to
marry you you little spitfire

  regardless of kays blazing eyes
and her choked let me go as
she writhed in his grasp he kissed her
again then he sprang into his saddle
and galloped off without a backward
look panting and trembling with
fury kay watched him go her mind
seething with the outrage it had all
taken place in such a fraction of a sec-
ond that she could hardly believe that
it had happened at all

  with a gasp of disgust she wiped
the back of her hand across her lips
and clenched her fist as she gazed after
the retreating figure in the moonlight
much as she had disliked josh hast-
ings she had never thought to be on
her guard against a thing like this
why he was old enough to be her
father she grabbed her handkerchief
and scrubbed her lips as though to
cleanse them of his polluting touch

  marry him a shudder ran through
her and a weak helpless feeling of
dread laid a cold clutch on her heart
suddenly she felt utterly defenseless
and alone whom could she turn to
aunt kate and babs were completely
under josh hastings spell she could
expect no help from them and if ted
failed her   

  josh hastings insinuating story
flashed in her mind and in spite of her
disbelief she found herself going over
it bit by bit

  even if the worst inferences about
the girl were false ted had probably
been involved in some way with her
and there was that other rumor about
the dark-haired girl he had fought
over that very day when he had later
come so splendidly to her rescue

  kay straightened up suddenly and
walked quickly back to the cabin her
head proudly high though her breath
still came in quick uneven jerks it
was certainly nothing to her how many

girls ted had all she wanted him to
come back for was to build her house
and barn for her

 memory of josh hastings kiss
flashed over her again running up
the steps of her cabin she hastily lit a
candle and flung herself down at her
fathers desk something in its very
solidity and the associations that clung
around it gave her a comforting sense
of strength

  he thinks hes going to marry me
does he kay savagely pulled open
a drawer and took out some paper
well see about that

  she scribbled a note to aunt kate
saying that she was going to send over
for them the next afternoon they
could have her cabin and she could
sleep outside in her sleeping bag sign-
ing it without further explanation she
left it on her desk so that she could
give it to one of the boys to take over
the first thing in the morning then
with the same feverish haste she
undressed and flung herself into
bed

  after a restless night of both wak-
ing and sleeping nightmares kay was
out at the crack of dawn and over at
the bunkhouse with her note when
she had actually dispatched shorty
with the summons to her family to
leave the flying six she felt better
by the time breakfast was over she
had persuaded herself that josh has-
tings had made up that story out of
whole cloth for the sole purpose of
damaging ted in her eyes

  when ted comes back im going
to tell him the whole thing she re-
solved as she made her way over to
the bunkhouse to consult seth about
getting another cot put up in her cabin

  it was nearly ten oclock before
shorty came back from the flying six
kay hastily tore open the note he
handed her addressed in her aunts
cramped old-fashioned handwriting a
slow color rose in her cheeks as she
read it through and then started it
over again she was suddenly aware
of shortys eyes on her and biting her
fire frenzy

l

lip to steady herself she looked up at
him

  thanks shorty there isnt any an-
swer she turned away with the note
clenched in her hand and ran down to
her cabin

  seated at the desk she spread it out
before her and incredulously read its
surprising contents again

   dear kay

      dont be a fool youre not the
    first girl to be kissed on a moonlight
    night josh hastings has told me all
    about it and his generous and hon-
    orable intentions toward you

      i certainly have no idea of com-
    ing back until the house is finished

    you can insist on babs coming but
    youll be pulling a hornets nest
    about your ears if you do

      i say again dont be a fool

your affectionate

                        aunt kate

  kay drew a long quivering breath as
she settled back and gazed at the door
vhere some flies buzzed drowsily in
the heat suddenly one of them
brushed against a cobweb and became
more and more enmeshed as it tried to
get away with an impulsive move-
ment kay jumped up put a finger
through the web and set the insect free

   if only someone would do that for
me she murmured as she settled
down and read aunt kates letter
again

   forcing herself not to let her judg-
ment be influenced by her indignation
she tried to consider the situation
calmly what aunt kate said about
babs was perfectly true kay realized
that she hadnt any too strong a hold
over babs headstrong and self-willed
nature and if she insisted on her com-
ing back in the face of aunt kates de-
termination to stay life wouldnt be
worth living

   viewed in the light of aunt kates
scornful reproval of kays attitude it
did seem ridiculous to make such a
fuss about a moonlight kiss by fore-
stalling her and telling aunt kate
about it and his desire to marry her
josh hastings had cut most of the

ground for righteous indignation from
under her feet

  there just didnt seem any way to
fight this insidious move of josh has-
tings to get her family under his in-
fluence and lined up against her she
could tell aunt kate about his plot to
get her timberland away from her but
that would involve telling the whole
beastly experience with scrap john-
son and kay had none too much con-
fidence in her aunts discretion to want
to trust her with that story

  besides shed probably explain away
josh hastings part in it by saying that
hed been trying to protect her from a
foolish move as long as she was
caught in the trap she might as well
accept it gracefully to have babs at
home in a rebellious mood when there
was so much to be done would be any-
thing but a help and to put such tragic
emphasis on a kiss snatched in the
moonlight was to magnify the impor-
tance of it out of all proportion

  reluctantly admitting that perhaps
she had been a fool to be quite so hasty
and dramatic about it kay crunched
up the note and threw it into the waste
basket

whose gun

two days had passed and still
there was no sign of ted gaynor
i dont undertsand it flicks kay
whispered brokenly as she slipped off
flickers bridle and leaned her head for
a moment against his mane do you
suppose- she broke off abruptly as
she saw shorty coming towards her

  hi there let me do that he
took the bridle from her hand you
hop to it and get some chow or youll
be out of luck

  thanks shorty kay braced her-
self and tried to smile has everyone
finished

  seth and a couple of the boys are
still there shorty answered bending
down to flickers cinch what dyou
think of the timber were cutting


ranch romances

  i think its fine only i hate to see
those great tamaracks come crashing
down

  now aint that just like a girl
shorty commented to flicker cocking
a quizzical eye at kay to catch the ef-
fect of his words here were break-
ing our backs building a barn for her
and she wants us to keep the trees to
have picnics under

  no i dont shorty kay laughed
at shortys comical expression in spite
of her heavy heart im as anxious to
get the barn built as you are only i
wish   she left the sentence un-
finished

  sure so do i shorty agreed an-
swering kays unspoken thought with
the freedom of an old friend you
know it almost seems as though some-
thing must have happened to that guy
he wasnt the kind to go back on his
word

  he wasnt was he kay agreed
eagerly then fearful of saying too
much once the flood-gates of her trou-
bled thoughts were opened she turned
and made for the mess shack

  as she and seth were discussing the
dimensions of the new barn a sudden
clatter of hoofs broke in on them
springing to her feet with a quick
premonition of trouble kay was half-
way to the door when it was suddenly
darkened by the lanky figure of zeke
farley the sheriff of butte county

  hello there he pulled off his
hat as his eye caught kay youre
just the girl i wanted to see do you
know that gun

  for a moment everything swam be-
fore kays eyes as she caught sight of
the gun the sheriff held out to her she
felt as though every drop of blood was
drained from her hfcart while she
stared at it and bracejd herself against
one of the chairs cotiscious of curious
faces crowded into the doorway behind
the sheriff she cleared her throat once
or twice before she could bring herself
to speak

 why-why yes she faltered
that was one of dads

  seth came around the table beside
her and took the gun out of the sher-
iffs hand sure it was he corrobo-
rated then he added before kay
could stop him but look here
wasnt this the one you gave to that
gaynor guy

  whats that the sheriff snapped
his keen eyes traveling from seth to
kay gave it to who when where
is he now

  kay moistened her lips before at-
tempting to answer this rapid fire of
questions her mind was leaping in
lightning flashes from one desperate
conjecture to another

  what did this gun in zeke farleys
hands mean was ted hurt-or
killed or had he killed someone else
beating through her fears for him was
the instinctive feeling that she must
watch her step and not say something
that would incriminate him

 where-where did you find it
she stalled for time by meeting the
sheriffs questions with another

  never mind that now zeke far-
ley spoke more gently as he saw kays
distress but his eyes were none the less
keen just tell us everything you
know about it

  realizing that all she could do was
to tell the truth kay explained how
she had given the gun to ted gaynor
and had last seen it when he started off
for clear water basin to get his
mother and sister and bring them back

  how did the gun come into your
hands kay ended forcing herself to
face the facts whatever they might be

  the sheriff hesitated and gave an im-
perceptible nod to seth over kays
head

  dont you worry about that he
evaded soothingly ill talk to seth
outside

  no you wont kay interposed her
eyes flashing and her body straight
and taut with determination youve
got to tell me anything you have to say
about it i wont be kept in suspense
the sheriff shrugged well i
reckon youve got to hear about it
fire frenzy



sooner or later so theres no point in
making a mystery about it also i
want to know all you can tell me about
this gaynor guy-where you met him
and how long youve known him and so
forth

 but how did you come by the
gun kay insisted you must tell me
that first

  the sheriff took the gun back from
seth and gravely weighed it in his
hand as he eyed it critically

  there aint much doubt he said
slowly but what this gun has killed a
man

  kay put her hand up to her throat
yes-yes-go on

  one of the fire patrol was coming
back over the divide yesterday and
there by the headwaters he found a
dead man shot through the temple
and not thirty feet away he came on
this gun lying where the murderer had
left it

  the dead man was a mile or so over
on the idaho side of the state line but
this guy was headed this way so he
brought the gun down to me i called
up the sheriff at clear water basin
but he was off after a bunch of rustlers
and his deputy asked me to help out on
the job until he could join me

 who was the man kay got the
question out through parched lips

 a fellow named scrap johnson
who was one of the flying six outfit
he-

  he got no further for kay with a
cry of mingled relief and dismay sud-
denly crashed down on the chair near
her

 no-no im all right she
pushed seth and the sheriff away as
they reached out to steady her its
just the horrible thought of dads gun
being involved in a murder that- but
how do you know it was murder she
demanded with renewed energy
there might have been a perfectly
fair fight

  wheres this gaynor bird then
why didnt he report it

  a horrible fear clutched hold of kay

perhaps hes killed too she fal-
tered

  weve searched all around there
the sheriff answered of course this
two-day storm has washed out any
tracks or clues we could go by but my
hunch is that he made a getaway right
after the killing and that he has va-
moosed

  but why would he have left his gun
behind kay protested hed never
have done such a stupid thing as that
if hed murdered a man

  search me but weve no time for
guessing the sheriff answered impa-
tiently tell me all you know about
him he looked from kay to seth

  all i know seth broke in is tnat
he turned up here the night of the fire
kay had been having him look over
some timberland for her and then de-
cided to have him join the outfit

  whered you get hold of him in the
first place zeke farley turned to
kay who braced herself for this ques-
tion she had been dreading in the
midst of her confused horror at this
terrible news one thing was clear
nothing would make her give the
real version of her meeting with
ted

  why i wanted to get hold of some
more timberland she began and it
seemed a good idea to get someone to
go over it so i-

  yes-yes never mind all that the
sheriff cut her short what i want
to know is how did you come to
choose gaynor why not someone from
around here

  i dont know just why kay sud-
denly decided the only line to take was
a helpless illogical feminine one i
just thought id try him out and then
if i liked him he could join the out-
fit  you thought he was a good addi-
tion didnt you seth she appealed to
seth with an attempt to defeat the
sheriffs direct questions by irrele-
vance

  sure i did seth answered he
seemed like an a-l hand to me but
ive been kind of wondering about him


ranch romances

when he didnt turn up when he said
he would

  how long has this man been dead
kay tried another tack to turn the line
of the inquiry

  about four or five days i should
judge zeke farley came back to the
remark of seths and asked whats
that about his being expected back
ill tell you how it was kay fore-
stalled seth hed planned to go back
to get his mother and sister and bring
them here to live you see hed worked
out a plan for rebuilding with a few
quick words she sketched out teds
ideas ending

  so i know he wouldnt have left us
in the lurch unless something had hap-
pened to him he might be wounded
dead or dying himself while youre ac-
cusing him of murder she choked
up in spite of herself i think you
ought to be searching for him to see if
hes in trouble instead of fooling
around about a gun she fixed the
sheriff with an indignant eye

  well be searching for him all
right the sheriff commented grimly
i just wanted to make sure my hunch
about the gun was right i thought id
seen your father toting it now that i
know you gave it to gaynor it clears
up a lot and things look pretty black
against him all right you probably
dont know that he was heard threaten-
ing this scrap johnsons life before
quite a few witnesses

  before-witnesses kay faltered
her mind flashing back to the scene on
the mesa when ted had told scrap
johnson hed kill him if he ever
showed up on the range again there
certainly hadnt been any witnesses
there besides herself

 yes the sheriff answered her

amazed query gaynor and scrap
johnson had a fight at kellys joint one
day last week and gaynor got the best
of it according to some of the boys
who were there he threatened to get
scrap next time

  tom runyons account of the fight
at kellys flashed in kays mind and
with a sick feeling she realized how
black the evidence was that was piling
up against ted

  but thats neither here nor there
said the sheriff turning to the door
the first thing is to join up with sam
cutter the idaho sheriff and catch the
bird we can save the evidence for
later he slipped the gun into his
pocket and picked up his hat sorry
to be all this bother miss kay ive
got to be getting on now but while im
away you try to remember every
single thing you can about this
gaynor

  where are you going kay asked
fearfully

  over into the clear water basin to
look up his mother and sister first
then ill report to sam cutters deputy
and come back by the pass and search
around there some more

  youll let me know the minute you
hear anything wont you kay tried
to keep the desperate anxiety out of
her tone we have no telephone now
but you could get hold of babs at the
flying six and shell ride over and tell
me

  sure i will zeke farley was al-
ready in his saddle as he made this
promise i hope youre right about
his being on the square but ive got
my doubts

  with this meager encouragement he
picked up his reins and made off

ranch romances

an outdoor lover

 dear editor

 i enjoy your magazine so much because it breathes
 of the great open spaces of which i am so fond but
 as i am forced to live in a crowded city at the present
 time i get very lonely it is very hard to make friends
 therefore would you be kind enough to publish my letter

 i would like pen pals from all over and will try to
 make my letters interesting i have camped and toured
 in canada from coast to coast i am a widow in my
 late thirties but enjoy outdoor life also music and the
 theater

 thanking you i remain

                          yours truly

 dear editor

 i have been reading your magazine for two years and
 not only myself but the whole family enjoy it now
 i am looking for pen pals-near and far all answers
 will find a zcelcome sign on my mail box especially those
 from foreign countries

 i am twenty-three years old and a high school gradu-
 ate as i spent a year in a college near richmond
 virginia i can tell some about the old and new south

 may my success in receiving pen pals be as great as
 yours in producing a wonderful magazine

sincerely

 dear editor

 i wonder if you could find a small space for an eng-
 lish girl to appeal for pen pals i have replied to
 numerous requests printed in ranch romances but up
 to date i have not had any replies

 i expect it is because the magazines from which i have
 taken them have been back numbers  am afraid we
 experience great difficulty over here to procure recent
 editions i have therefore arrived at the conclusion that
 it is pehaps much better to make a personal appeal so
 here goes		 

 as it seems customary to give a description of one-
 self and ones favorite pastime here are mine i am
 nineteen years of age have blue eyes brozvn wavy hair
 and a fair complexion i expect i could pass as good-
 looking on a dark night i am very fand of dancing
 and i play tennis every day during the season i am
 a pretty strong swimmer and i also go camping and
 hiking

 if any pals from australia and the united states feel
 inclined to write i should be most pleased to let them
 have an interesting reply

 heres wishing ranch romances heaps of success tn
 the future and hoping that you will be able to find a
 small space for me somewhere i am

                           yours sincerely

by professor marcus mari
september
virgo

 jtirgo rules until september twenty-third these people are fine scholars musicians and
 v leaders along educational lines they are original in speech and their minds are quick
 and well balanced

     men of this sign should not waste time in subordinate positions as they are capable
 executives and work best when independent of domination freedom is as necessary to
 them as air they chafe under restraint give way to intolerance and impatience and
 become thoroughly unhappy and make others equally wretched

      confidence entrusted to the people of this sign is in safe keeping for nothing under the
 sun can induce them to betray a trust

     they are self-conscious and sensitive in the extreme though they have a full share
 of self-esteem they are especially in youth seized with a shyness which unless checked by
 reason and the acquirement of poise becomes almost a panic

     they make fine loyal friends and in the home are delightful companions who are very
 earnest in their desire to contribute to the comfort of their loved ones

     in the signs of leo libra and pisces the people of virgo will find congenial mates
 and friends
