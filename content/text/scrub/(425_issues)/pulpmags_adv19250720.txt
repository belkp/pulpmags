 if you want the truth go to a child j epson had a spectacular record as a salesman they used to call him crash-em-down jepson and the bigger they were the harder they fell lately though jepson felt himself slipping he
couldnt seem to land the big orders and he was too
proud to go after the little ones he was discouraged
and mystified finally one evening he got the real
truth from his little boy you can always depend on a
child to be outspoken on subjects that older people avoid
 

  you yourself rarely know when you have halitosis
unpleasant breath thats the insidious thing about it

and even your closest friends wont tell you maybe
not even your wife

  but usually-and fortunately-halitosis is onlya local con-
dition that yields to the regular use of listerine as a mouth
wash and gargle for listerine halts food fermentation
in the mouth and leaves the breath sweet fresh and clean

  by using this really remarkable safe antiseptic system-
atically you know your breath is right and that you are
on the safe and polite side

  your druggist sells listerine in the original brown
package only-four sizes  ounce  ounce  ounce
and  ounce buy the large size for economy--lambert
pharmacal company saint louis u s a

listerine throat tablets are nozv available
please do not make the mistake of expecting them to
correct bad breath rely on the liquid listerine
containing all of the antiseptic essential oils of
listerine however they are very valuable as a relief
for throat irritations- cents

what can soap do for your skin

the scientific basis
for the use of
soap

 the following set of prin-
 ciples has been endorsed
 by  physicians of high-
 est standing and is offered
 as an authoritative guide to
 women in their use of soap
 for the skin

 	the function of soap for
  the skin is to cleanse not
  to cure or transform

 	soap performs a very
 useful function for nor-
 mal skins by keeping the
 skin clean

 	if there is any disease of
  the skin which soap irri-
  tates a physician should
  be seen

 	to be suitable forgeneral
  daily use a soap should
  bepure mild ana neutral

 	if the medicinal content
  of a soap is sufficient to
  have an effect upon the
  skin the soap should be
  usea only upon the ad-
  vice of a physician

 	in all cases of real trou-
  ble a physicians advice
  should be obtained be-
  fore treatment is at-
  tempted

new- g

 the specialists answer is simple

tphe scientist - the derma-
tologist the reputable
physician the chemist-is the
only authority worth listening
to on the care of your skin
whether he is talking about
cosmetics or treatments

or

soap

   soap for instance is an ex-
ceedingly important factor in
the care of your skin medical
authorities say you cant get
hygienically clean without it

  on the other hand these
same authorities will tell you
that soap cannot cure your
skin nor nourish it nor

render it beautiful except as it
makes it clean-choose your
soap not to achieve miracles
but to cleanse your skin safely

 when you buy soap for
your complexion buy a pure
mild neutral soap if you
choose ivory you have as fine
a soap as can be made regard-
less of price ivory is pure
gentle safe it contains no
medicaments or coloring
matter or strong perfume it
renders with fine distinction

any soap

author of the way of a horse and a man news from gods country

wihen the sun was about a hands
span above the seven devils in
the west blake moody and hank
-i ii mi fairless rode down to tom mc-
alisters skull creek ranch their horses
blakes blaze-faced stocking-legged bay
and hanks gray were lean and hard from
the weeks on a trail that stretched with
many devious turnings from new mexico
to idaho hank was returning to his old
stomping ground blake who had never
before ridden so far north had come over
the mountains like the classical bear to see
what he could see

  there was mild activity at the ranch a
band of loose horses palpably unbroken
ones were bunched at the far side of a cor-
ral there were saddle horses with trailing
reins and a few men by the corral gate

  so thats the kind of mustang you breed
in idaho blake observed it was sig-
nificant that in his swift glance over the
scene which had taken in horses men and
the plan of buildings and corrals the fact

   lucky moon copyright  by everett saunders

that the horses were young percherons
should have impressed him always he in-
stinctively appraised animals from gen-
eral and individual characteristics to marks
and brands

  i suppose them colts is israel browns
hank said yes there he is talkin to
tom mcalister he owns the i-s outfit on
squaw crick wonder what the ol duf-
fers doin with his colts up here

  before i left here he had brung in some
mares an a stallion or two he said he was
tired of seein ten dollar fuzz-tails eat up all
the bunch grass if a man is goin to raise
horses is says he might as well raise
horses hes a purty long-headed ol
israel let him look at a bunch uh steers
with the latest quotations in his head an
hell tell you in three cents uh what theyre
worth

  and yet said blake if some sticky-fin-
gered hombre was to run em off the range
its a safe bet hed pick a bullet-headed
snake-eyed cross between bob wire and
wildcat to ride after em and the fuzz-tail
would cover four miles of trail to their two

and kicked open a swinging gate he was
greeted loudly as they approached the group
by the corral

  well if it aint hank fairless back
again exclaimed a youth in bespangled
chaps must have found some tough
country in your travels to come back
here whatd you see that was new
anyhow

well said fairless slowly right in the
middle uh december when the snow should
uh been neck deep to a tall indian i seen the
ground so hot the sand swifts was stoppin
ever three yards to spit on their feet an
 seen-

  thatll do hank mcalister the
owner came forward thats about all
we can stand to oncet sorry they wasnt
able to change you some fer the better down
there but im right glad to see you any-
how

  it was as though fairless had been gone
only seven days he knew them all rob
white the youth who had first spoken
israel brown of the is ranch middle aged
red faced with an air of solid prosperity
that was not misleading-he owned much
land and many cattle

  there was dick young handsome lean
faced and self-assured who had inherited a
comfortable fortune in land and not a few
cattle wearing the bar y brand his man-
ner indicated that he had clean forgotten
that another man than himself had accu-
mulated the wealth he rode a black
leather saddle heavy with silver mounting
on a proud dappled gray horse his spade
bit was of massive silver as were the con-
chas on his chaps

  there were harry satory and carl mo-
dell mcalisters year-round men who were
top cow hands

  brown on a deal with young for some
young shorthorn bulls had been looking
over the bar y cattle which were ranged
south of skull creek there he had un-
expectedly run across a band of his per-
cherons they had corraled the horses at
the skull creek ranch and mcalister had
agreed to send them back to their range
next day rob white had been riding
for young

  this man with me fellers said hank
by way of introduction calls himself
blake moody hes a cowpuncher an
when i say cowpuncher i mean just that
hes texas arizony an new mexico breed

you notice he rides a double-rig saddle with
a hard twist rope tied fast-which last i
dont care to imitate not on this rough
range

  if youve got any doubts about this
hombre bein a puncher just bring out any
limber-backed head-fightin man-eatin
buckin strikin kickin cant-be-rode mus-
tang you got an watch blake top him off
things like them in there he contemptu-
ously indicated the young pure-breds in the
corral just strap a big piece uh plate glass
flat on their backs an stand him up on it
with a pair uh skates

  ye-a brown roused in defense of his
stock thats all you horse-killers think
about whoop-pe ride em an scratch
em both ways from the cinch them colts
aint saddle horses if ive got to tell you
inside a year theyll fetch me two hundred
apiece

  that is hank interposed if they
dont fetch somebody else a hundred an
fifty in the meantime

  which proves i aint the only one they
look good to as i was tellin tom jest
now its danged funny to me the way they
ramble around six days ago they was on
their squaw crick range today i find em
up towards the head uh skull crick if
ever i ketch anybody chasin them colts
around an i happen to be packin a gun
that fellers goin to think hes been teasin
a nest of bald hornets

        well anyhow said hank
its a sagebrush cinch i aint as
i much of a horse-killer as i might
be  deuteronomy aint dead
yet an hes just finished a trip from close
to the border besides we chased cows off
an on up the line an run mustangs awhile
in nevada

  when hank talks for me said blake
with serious mien it aint any sign hes
got my permission knowing him you
wont expect me to live up to any reputa-
tion he might give me i did ride for a one-
horse outfit for a couple weeks once and sort
of liked the work now im looking for a
job hank said maybe thered be one
here

  mcalister assured them there would be
shortly the fall roundup was to begin in
a few days meanwhile they could stick
round and start a few broncs or something
till the work began
lucky moon



  at the supper table the irrepressible
 hank went on talking

 since me an this sidekick uh mine may
 be around here for some time its only fair
 for you to be warned about him so you can
 pertect yourselves hes square but hes

 afflicted with misbecomin convictions about
 new moons when blake gits his lamps on
 the new moon across his right shoulder he
 swears that for the next thirty days he cant
 be outrun throwed down or bucked off on
 a bronc he scratches with both feet an
 his low hands in poker is full houses an four
 of a kind

   you may think im kiddin you but i
aint hank had his knife loaded to the
hilt poised halfway between his plate and
his mouth it was called to my notice
one evenin just after we had crossed the
nevada line the sun had went down an
the sky was dusky our general direction
was north mind you if the trail hadnt
bent south around the point of a ridge
wed uh been ruined because just then
blake happened to look across his right
shoulder an seen the new moon over by
calif orny

   i shiver yet to think whatd happened
if ol nibs nose had been pointed north
after that we always et when we was hun-
gry if we had any place to mooch or buy
grub or any jack-

   try the sword-swallowing act with that
 knife hank blake interrupted with utter
 lack of appreciation of the monologue
 the cargo of grub on it is getting
 cold

   ive noticed he went on to the others
 that the only times anybody would mistake
 hank for anything but an escaped inmate
 of a sane assylum is when hes got his

 mouth crammed so full of grub or the
 neck of a whisky bottle he cant make a
 sound

   yes go on an finish your supper
 hank said satory we predate the
 warnin but i figger we can take a chance
 with a run of luck thirty days long i dont
 believe there is any such animal

   youll see hank said i aint kiddin
 you thats a sagebrush cinch

   i reckon theres nobody but what knows
 theres something in luck said blake i
 aint superstitious though you might think
 so if you didnt know hank and the freedom
 he takes with the truth but ive got this to
 say the most glaring example of luck on
 earth is this same hank fairless if i talked
 as much as he does all the new moons in
 the sky-and there may be a pile of em off
 among the stars from what i hear-couldnt
 keep me from getting stitched from my
 adams apple to my belt inside six days

   aint that the truth said modell
 when he left here for the south that time
 id have bet my new chaps agin the hole in
 a doughnut hed never survive his first
 meetin with a gang of strangers

   hank had made a jest of something in
 which blake was more than three-fourths
 serious according to his own statement
 he wasnt in the least superstitious he
 didnt believe in ghosts that prowled around
 dragging clanking chains but he did have
 a feeling that could hardly be called a belief
 a feeling rooted deeper than reason judg-
 ment or any conscious thought-process
 that when he got his first glimpse of the
 new moon over his right shoulder then for
 the next twenty-eight days all things were
 essentially right for blake moody

  to his own undoing he had once in
 an unguarded moment mentioned this to
 hank

   three months back when the remuda had
 been turned loose at the diamond outfit in
 new mexico and he and hank confronted
 by the necessity of seeking other employ-
 ment he had let a flipped coin decide for
 him whether he should go to idaho with
 hank or accept a flattering offer from a
 man high in the employ of a big cattle out-
 fit operating in south america to go to
 argentina hank didnt want any south
 america in his the old u s a was
 plenty good enough for him blake spun
 the coin heads north tails south and heads
 came up


adventure

           ii

the cook shack at skull creek
ranch was set on the north side
of a driveway the bunkhouse
was directly opposite it on the
south a beaten path lay between the two
buildings the boys finished the meal and
filed along the path by ones and twos

  the sun had just set there had been a
magnificent play of color in the sky crossing
the zenith and spraying clouds with crimson
down to the very horizon in the east now
it was darkling the brilliance going out
swiftly

  blake who had not looked into an
almanac in months who never made an
effort to remember the dates of the moons
changes was looking into the gorgeous west
out of the sky as if conjured by magic where
it had swum concealed by light appeared
the moon in its first quarter juvenescent
riding downward on the heels of the sun it
was a thin curved sliver of veritable silver
above the silhouette of the saw-toothed
seven devils

  oblivious to his surroundings uplifted
by the beauty of the sky blake looked
across the quarter million miles of space
and read a promise of good luck in the
omen he was jerked rudely back to
reality

  whatd i tell you hank yelled tri-
umphantly  blakes goin true to
form youll find out i wasnt kiddin you
before youre a week older

  but youll have to pull luck for both of
us blake just after i come out the door
i was weavin around watchin that dad
blamed bull bat swoop hither an yon an
cut his monkey shines up there an i seen
the moon straight down my left shoulder

  they assembled in the bunkhouse hank
threw himself groaning luxuriously upon a
bunk

  i only hope the cornin hard luck dont
hit me soon enough to keep me from tearin
off forty or fifty good winks tonight im
sure weary

  theres all kinds of chances for you
to cash in on this moon blake satory
laughed as he rummaged among the tobacco
cans on a shelf for a deck of cards the
annual rodeo is bein pulled off at maverick
before long theys big prizes offered for
the bronc ridin bulldoggin ropin an bull
ridin contests a swell silver-mounted saddle

an lots of good hard coin if its a fact you
go in for forkin mean broncs an luck is
with you it might pay you to ride over
there

  but i dont suppose hank was doin
nothin but run off at the face for my part
i never could see as it payed to go up agin
the perfessional riders that foller the rodeos
the fixed judges an so forth the local
boys has sure got to do the fancy cowboyin
to stand a chance for the money

  say hank roared rolling out of the
bunk ive took about enough disrespect
from you imitation cow hands runnin off
at the face i never told a thing in my
life that a preacher wouldnt back up with
his hand on a stack uh bibles a mile high

  but ive bragged on that unappreciatin
blake moody for the last time ill never
say nothin in his favor agin if i five six
hundred years except this hes the niftiest
little rider that ever dumb over a saddlin
chute to git aboard a locoed bronc an if
you dont believe it just wait till ive earnt
a little money to gamble with an ill take
all your wages away from you

  dont go back to bed yet satory said
its a long time till mornin pull up
that chair an ill shoot you a little game of
seven-up

  be sociable and make it penny ante
rob white suggested he was a handsome
youth who affected a manner of studied
nonchalance he was wide between the
eyes and his mouth and jaws suggested the
possibility of hardening into strength of
character

  gimme them cards hank scooped
them up and began shuffling draw or
stud i vote for stud an hereby deal the
first hand he said without waiting for an
answer

  i like stud its fast i can lose my few
pennies quicker an git back to my much-
needed rest

  yes you must get a good long rest to-
night rob drawled youll want to go
to jim taylors barn dance tomorrow night
we know how you love to dance

  ye-a hank snarled love to dance
the last time i tried to dance i got myself
blame nigh laid up for a week them other
dancers wasnt satisfied just to step on my
toes they even walked on my knees
the game had been going on for half an
hour when mcalister with brown and
young came in mcalister outlined the
lucky moon



next days work blake and hank were to
ride to the clear creek shed and bring over
some horses for the cawy satory and
modell were to help white put browns
horses back on their squaw creek range

  brown and young were ready to start
home but israels eyes were caught by the
movement of cards and chips poker was
his one weakness the bent of mind that
so dfcew him to the game turned in another
direction had been one of the factors in his
success in his business he had always been
willing to take a long chance expand his
holdings on a shoestring in the face of des-
perate odds bluff with nothing in the hole
his wisdom had been sufficient to prevent
over-indulgence in literal poker games

if this aint too steep id
like to git in fer a few minutes
he said want to let my sup-
per di-gest a little before i start
anyhow

  purty steep is hank told him the
whites are one cent the reds are one cent
the blues are one red cent per each can
you stand it

  ill try it a whirl hate to take a chance
on cripplin myself though a man ortent
to resk losin moren he can afford to

  he pulled out a long leather sack emptied
a handful of coins on the table and bought a
stack with a quarter young followed suit

  the character of the game changed
swiftly the original players immediately
felt the weight of money they had tacitly
accepted a low limit in the betting but
young began backing his cards more
heavily hank allowed himself to be bluffed
out of a pot he pushed back his chair

  cant play aginst money with chicken-
feed ill just let blake hold up my end
blake kept his chair he and israel
brown allowing for the difference thirty
years of living always make had character-
istics in common once in a game be the
stakes high or low his urge was to go all the
way through as the betting stiffened his
concentration intensified he ceased bandy-
ing jokes he tilted his hat forward until
the brim shaded his eyes his money low
in the beginning he played with extreme
caution waiting for high cards on the first
turns time after time refusing to ante
he pushed his first two cards to the center of
the table

  rob white playing like the callow youth

he was quickly ran his money out in drib-
lets while the betting between young and
brown went higher and higher

  the deal had come to rob he turned
all his pockets inside out elaborately laid
tobacco cigaret papers matches pocket
knife and handkerchief before him then
he set his last few counters and small coins
in the center and began shuffling

  this is my last one he explained un-
necessarily unless i drew something
highern a pair of deuces anyhow i dont
see the good in playing em all against my
belly his reference was palpably to
blake might as well get it over with if
i cant have any luck looks like the new
moon hank was telling us about is taking a
vacation

  blake raised a pair of disconcerting eyes

  you heard hank talking when you
hear me talk about luck youll be told that
pure luck is two-thirds brains some people
just naturally cant have any luck

  if you was awful careful to spend all
your time in good company rob hank
put in you might develop enough brains to
recognize a good poker player when you see
one

  ill stay out of your company then all i
can the youth retaliated half angry

  he was not succeeding in dealing himself
anything worth while but a pair of sevens
back to back had fallen to blake and he
was moving in he continued to stay
paying heavily for the privilege when the
last card was turned all his money was
in the pot he had two pairs eights and
sevens in sight and a third seven in the hole
brown had three kings and young two large
pairs each had had blake beaten up to
the last turn and each had backed his hand

  ahj hank breathed as blake drew in
the fat pot now were startin to go

  with a wider margin to play in blake
loosened up the pile of bills and coins
before him grew steadily

  did you say this friend o yourn was a
cow hand or a tinhorn brown asked of
hank as he fished a check book from an
inside pocket the few minutes he had
allowed himself in the beginning were now
long past he had wholly forgotten such
things as di-gesting suppers he was
thralled by the game losing money half
angry and enjoying himself

  i said cowpuncher hank exulted
youre now gittin the experience uh


adventure

playin poker with an amachure whats in
luck did somebody try to kid me about
the new moon a while ago or no huh

  luck blatherashun have you got
a new deck o cards around here these
have got grease spots an finger prints all
over em

  blakes head came up with a snap

  the boys was playing with these paste-
boards he drawled i was invited in the
game without going into details id say
youve got as good a chance to read these
marks as i have you put on as many as
i did

  i didnt mean that brown growled
but look at the dog ears on that ace o
hearts

  i seen it you noticed i didnt bet it
the two times i had it buried

  satory had dragged a suit case from un-
der a bunk from a tangle consisting of
a loud and wrinkled silk shirt a blue silk
muffler and a pair of cotton drawers he
brought out a new deck with the seal un-
broken he thumped it down upon the
table

  you can have real service in carly
monto gents he told them

  the new deck made no change in blakes
spectacular drawing all that counted on
that evening were the numbers of hearts
clubs spades or diamonds printed on the
faces of the cards at the end of three hours
brown and young had each drawn several
sizable checks

  blake had won the price of several good
young percherons and shorthorn bulls the
equivalent of the earnings of many months
at fifty dollars

ill

         the sun had not yet risen from
behind the shoulder of mt mini-
doka when blake and hank
swung into their saddles they
helped satory modell and white start
browns percheron colts northward along
the road to the i-s then they turned toward
the mountain crossed the low divide be-
tween skull and clear creeks and took a
steep rutty dim and crooked road up the
creek bottom

  the thorn and service-berry bushes were
full of ripe fruit in purple clusters where
the canon broke from the higher hills lay a
small down-at-heel ranch

  there was a jumble of dilapidated log
shacks small barns sheds and chicken
coops with leaky roofs and wide cracks
unchinked between the logs there were
corrals with staggering fences and a hun-
dred acres of gently sloping alluvial delta
that was cultivated after a haphazard
fashion except for a thin thread of smoke
from the chimney the place seemed de-
serted

  who tends bar up here asked blake

  tom harris  toms a bum house-
keeper hes a bum rancher too as you
may notice but it used to be a sight to
see him jackknife his old carkiss in a chair
hook his chin on a fiddle an scrape out
buffalo gals meanwhile poundin the floor
with his right heel hes a artist with a fid-
dle or at callin a quadrille

  israel brown says if tomd took half
as much interest tendin to his business as
he done scrapin a fiddle he would uh been
a millionaire like as not hes right a
man gits good at the thing he likes but
its sure tough for the old feller to live way
up here all alone by himself with only a
two-gallon jug uh snake-bite remedy he gen-
erally keeps for company if we wasnt so
conscientious about earnin our wages wed
go in an chew the fat with him awhile

  come to think of it i beleve its our
duty

  they rode down to the log cabin there
was a crumbling stick-and-mud chimney in
the rear and a lean-to shed on one side
harris himself met them at the door

  to use his own phrase harris had
growed most of his growin endways he
was six feet one inch tall and very narrow
his vest swung open over a flannel shirt
that had several buttons missing his over-
alls hung in folds he had to git his
pants a mite too big around to git the right
lenth

  his leathery face wrinkled into a grin at
sight of hank

  didnt never expect to see you agin
he said

  howre you tom anyhow hank
cried wringing his hand hows ever
little thing suppose youre goin to take
in taylors barn dance tonight

  i aimed to said harris sadly but my
hosses dumb out through the fence day
afore yistidy an the cussed rheumatics has
got my laigs jimmed up so i cant scarcely
walk cant go after em handy id shore
lucky moon



like to but i reckon i wont be able to git
down thar

  youre talkin like an old man hank
reproved never heard you cussin rheu-
matics before an i never knowed you to
miss a dance in forty miles

  i am an old man said tom i aint
good fer nothin no more rheumatics has
been cornin on me gradual fer years here
lately theyre gittin the best of me a
danged dentist that pulled a tooth fer me
five year ago said my teeth was the cause
of it he wanted to pull em all an make a
set of false ones after my money

  first chance i git im goin to sell out
the ranch an move down to riggin i want
a little seegar store to keep up expenses an
give me a chance to take it easy

  come in an set down you might as
well chaw the rag with me awhile

  they entered the cabin bags hung from
smoky rafters unwashed tin dishes and
pound tobacco tins littered the table dust
was deep on the floor and one glimpse of
the grimy stove would have sent a woman
into hysterical tears the only cared-for
articles in sight were two well-oiled rifles
resting across the prongs of a set of five-
point antlers nailed to the wall

  find cheers tom told them lowering
himself with solicitude for stiff joints into
the nearest

  nope i aint good fer nothin no more
he repeated cant ranch to do any good
a cow seldom brings me in moren one calf
a year better let me sell out to you young
fellers like you could shore make things hum
ive got a good layout here

  fat chance uh me buyin a ranch
hank laughed i didnt have much
moren enough to buy a pair uh wrasslin
trunks for a grasshopper when i hit the
skull crick ranch last night i played
poker with is brown an dick young for a
few minutes an now itd plumb break me
to pay the first instalment on a free lunch
i didnt much expect you to be flush
enough to buy a ranch even if they were
givin em away tom said but if you
run acrost anybody in the market fer one
you can boost the sale fer me im offerin
good terms wont take much money to
swing the deal is brown has got a plaster
on it not very big if somebodyll pay off
that mortgage an show me he means to
try he can pay off the rest as he makes it
all right ill buy it if nothin elsell

do you ill give a note with my horse an
saddle for scurity

  an i might be able to pay spot cash
with a little help from blake i forgot to
tell you tom that im ridin with a ranny
to who money aint no object it would
uh done your ol rheumatic heart good to
see him cleanin is brown an dick young
in that stud game last night fastest game
you ever seen in a bunk house too blake
stays on the right side uh the moon-or the
moon stay on his right side i forgit which
he was earnin money at the rate of half
million or so a year for two or three hours
wouldnt be no wiser thing that you
could do if you did make a cleanin at
cards than to sink it into a good ranch
harris told blake with the manner of wise
age to youth if you dont salt it down
itll run right out through a hole in your
pocket an youll never know where it
went to

  i know it said blake im figgering
on setting up all night and put sheet iron
patches on all of my pockets so this jack
wont spill till i get to argentina next
winter they told hank itd be summer
there then but he didnt believe it and
they tell me a few thousand of american
money there will buy a ranch half as big
as idaho

  some ranch said tom

  but that aint whats worryin me
hank interposed ive been settin here
all this time waitin for you to insult me by
offerin me a drink but you aint said a
word	a

  i haint been to the city fer so long the
ol jugs about empty there may be a few
swallers left in it

  thats enough if theyre good big
swallers said hank

  tom hauled a stone jug from under the
bunk and handed it to blake who tilted
it to his lips with heres how to his
host

  aw blake hank protested you just
plain waste it you take just enough to
wet your neck never enough to git down
to where itll do some good youre like
a feller with a reservoir for irrigation lettin
out the water in driblets that wets the ditch
but never runs out on the field purty soon
the reservoir is empty an still the grass
aint growin- dog-gone he broke off
im glad you didnt take much there
aint much in here


adventure

  but he gurgled five times before offering
the jug to tom who shook his head

  kill it he invited you will before
you git away anyhow

  hank did so gratefully then set it down
tom he said now i know durn well
youre really gittin old when a man gits
so careless as to let his stock uh snake-bite
remedy run down to nothin hes bound to
come to grief once i seen a basco sheep-
herder thats been bit by a rattler the
camp tender was packin him out he was
all swole up big sore where the fangs had
struck blood poisonin developin tum-
ble id uh been all broke up if itd been
a human bein instid of a sheepherder

  i wouldnt have no trouble keepin medi-
cine fer myself tom said but ive got
too many friends that come by in need of
perventative treatments

  i hate to see you miss that dance
hank worried i mean i hate to see that
dance miss you did you say your horses
had got away

  yes bunch of range stuff come pawin
around the fence they got to fightin back
an forth an knocked off some rails my
plugs follered the wild ones off theyre
right up thar in the canon a piece but i
aint got nothin to chase em on

  well git em for you hank stated
rising to his feet a barn dance wouldnt
be nothin without ol tom harris to call
quadrilles besides blake tom wants us
to leave hes been as good as blamin us
for lappin up the last of his likker

  i knowed youd go as soon as the jug
was empty said tom thats why i
didnt offer you a drink no sooner

above the ranch they climbed
out of the canon they rode
along the elevation scanning each
hollow and tributary gulch for
signs of the horses at last they located
them

  the wild horses broke away as the riders
approached hank pointed out the two
belonging to harris after a sharp run
blake got his rope on the slower of the two
a string-halted old roan mare the other
was able to keep up with the band and
hank galloping recklessly swinging his
lariet got a nasty fall when his horse stepped
into a badger hole

  blake led his poor prize to where hank
was picking himself up swearing softly and

feeling for broken bones his face was a
mask of blood and dust where he had
barked it as he slid upon the ground

  one horse is all tom can ride at once
hank said ididnt want the othern
anyhow

  thats what a man always gits when he
tries to help the other feller he com-
plained daubing at his face with a blue
bandanna im goin to quit it after
this hank fairless is the hombre im goin
to look out for whatd i care whether
tom gits to taylors dance or not i cant
dance here ive went to all this trouble
for a gang that like as not wont appreci-
ate it

  that was sure a dirty fall blake said
sympathetically but if you feel like rid-
ing at all wed better not kill any more
time were not going to get any cayuses
to skull creek if we dont pound em on
the tail

  its that new moon workin already
hank said i wasnt suprized when my
horse went down you see it down your
right shoulder an almost break ol is
brown i look at it down my left an al-
most break my own neck the first time i
ride out of a trot

  they led the horse back to harris place
the old man invited them to stay for din-
ner since it was nearly noon and a long
time since breakfast they accepted they
helped him cook and took it upon them-
selves to sweep the floor and wash the
dishes

  it was late afternoon by the time they
had collected several scattered bunches of
horses and had driven them into the clear
creek corrals

  well just leave em here tonight said
hank no time now to git em to skull
crick well go straight down to taylors
if we stay up all night at the dance it wont
be necessary to strain our will power gittin
out of the blankets early in the mornin

  mcalister wont gather much of an
opinion of our speed blake said here
weve killed the whole day riding a few
miles and driving some ponies into a corral

  leave it to me i wont have to he
much one look at my map an tomll
know we must uh been busy at something

  yes busy stopping a band saw with
your face i dont care much about that
dance anyhow blake demurred these
clothes aint fit to go to a party in
lucky moon



  clothes hank exclaimed dont you
know that the constitution uh the united
states pervides that any cowpuncher goin
to a dance wearin anything but his boots
with a pair uh good ol levi strauses stuffed
into em is to be took out an hung to a
cottonwood or if they aint any cotton-
wood handy to a wagon-tongue propped
up on a neck-yolk aint you learnt that
yet

  no i didnt get a good education like
you did hank but we cant drive these
horses in the dark so we might as well go
i wouldnt mind looking on for awhile

iv

from the number of wagons
and buckboards parked on the
roomy barn lot from the horses
of all shapes colors and sizes
under harness and saddle hitched all about
it appeared that the whole countryside had
turned out for jim taylors barn dance
a glance at the interior of the big log barn
was confirmation of the impression

  the barn was fragrant with hay lan-
terns swung over a brightly lighted space
where they danced and shadows leaped
and swayed against the dusky recesses mys-
terious areas of gloom outside the range of
light

  when blake and hank entered the crowd
was already warmed up an organ had
been brought in a girl with a dwarfish
malformed body and a pair of beautiful and
uncannily intelligent eyes in an ill-favored
face was at the instrument hank labeled
her as jane compton

  her folks lives up toward riggin nice
folks shes been sick most of her life
shes spent several years in the east new-
brasky ioway or some place with relations
shes smart as a whip but stuck-up an
she dont care a whoop how hard she shoots
it into a feller i wouldnt live in the same
house with her a week for nineteen million
pesos bad as i need money

  but say if you want to see a classy
dame take a look at rob whites sister
betty there she is cornin out on the
floor with dick young now dont she
look like seven hundred dollars shes a
great friend uh janes though i dont
recklect she ever was far from this neck uh
the woods she thinks shes purty dog-gone
wise too

blake located the individuals indicated
by hank but when his eyes found betty
white he quested no further the girl was
the embodiment of his dream of fair

woman

at that moment the thin frame of tom
harris was most prominent he was call-
ing for two more couples to complete
the set

two more couples he shouted need
jest two more an uncourtly young man
led out a bashful girl jest one more
come on children he ran to the wall and
seized upon the middle aged jim taylor
and his wife

been ten year since i tried to dance
taylor protested as tom dragged them out
disregarding protests and thrust them into
place

now he said balancing himself on
one leg

         all to your places
         an straighten up your faces

        hook up your traces

         an go hog wild everbody dance i

from the organ came the quick-beating
harum-scarum strains of the irish washer-
woman

          first lady out

         lady on the right

         swing the guy thats got the cash

        now the one with the black mustache

         now the one that wears fine clothes

         now the one with the big plug nose

        meet your pardner

         make a little bow

        turn right back

         an youre all right now

the two sets swung into the impetuous
rhythm of the dance tapping time with feet
swinging in their turns blake contrasted
betty white with the other women she
was merry but restrained animated but
graceful she made a classic of the rude
quadrille

         first gent out

         swing the gal with the purty hair

         now the one that puts on airs

         now the one that dresses so neat

         now the one with the great big feet
         swing waist swing

         up the road an down the lane

         right an left through
         an the center couple swing

        move children move

faster and faster whirled the dancers
old tom palpably free of rheumatic pains
was a dynamo of enthusiastic energy clap-
ping his hands stamping out the beat of the
io

adventure

music darting in to straighten out confused
couples bawling

       swing your pard like swingin on the gate
       swing your honey an dont be late

      home you go an turn em all around

      heep a-hookin on

  hanks eyes shone

  aint he a humdinger i claim ol tom
is sure a artist when it comes to callin a
square dance im sure glad you got a
string on that ol roan before i got my spill

  wonder if jim forgot to lay in a little
kag uh wet lunch

  but blake was not concerned with wet
lunches nor though he had had no supper
with the fat steer that was roasting in a pit
and filling the air with appetizing odors
now he really regretted the poor clothes
he wore but his solicitude was largely un-
called for with the exception of dick
young who was really well-dressed none
of the men more than faintly approached
conventional attire young alone deserved
the death sentence according to hanks con-
stitutional provisions the punchers wore
new and crinkly overalls high heeled boots
with bright handkerchiefs around their necks

  blakes attention was all for one model of
artistry he had resolved not to dance
now he resolved to break that resolve as
the dancers were leaving the floor he turned
upon his friend

  say hank do you love me

  its a sagebrush cinch i do cowboy
youre the only sweetheart i got an i
never trifle on you though youre dad
blamed mean to me at times

  then prove it by giving me an introduc-
tion to that girl i look like a tramp but
theres a lot more rigged out just as bad

  if i know anything about you thats
just what you are ill do it ol hoss but
the lord knows youd have a better send-off
if somebody more poplar with the ladies
interduced you tell you what ill git rob
to do it

and he did rob with the air
of somnolent disdain introduced
blake to his sister as a cattleman
from new mexico

  i met him at mcalisters last night
betty he acted like he was thinkin of
taking over the i-s outfit or the bar y i
dont know much about him but i guess
hes as fit to dance with as me or dick
young

  the melting strains of a waltz floated
from the organ and they glided out upon the
floor she raised her eyes to his

  i believe rob said you are a cattle man
you look awfully young to be managing a
lot of money are you really thinking of
locating here

  yes he said for the last five min-
utes ive been thinking strong about it
then at her puzzled expression he laughed
when rob said i am a cattleman he must
have meant that i am of the stuff that some
cattlemen are made of im a cowpuncher
a puncher that owns some cattle might be
rated as a stockman so as soon as i get a
ranch and some cattle ill be one if rob
is truthful that must be what he meant

  rob isnt always strictly truthful she
smiled

  they talked as they danced some of
their utterances bore sense some were com-
monplace many were banalities but
blake was enraptured and to the best of
his judgment the music of the waltz was
only ten seconds from start to finish

  he asked for the next waltz and it was
granted him

  the hours sped by the music and laugh-
ter ran away blake had a wonderful time
at intervals he danced with betty white
he danced with no one else between those
infrequent waltzes he stood in an obscure
place near the wall and watched her

  his sensations were not untroubled joy
dick young suave and well-dressed a nota-
ble figure in the crowd danced with betty
two times to blakes one blake would have
indignantly denied being touched with in-
cipient jealousy

  nevertheless he wondered acutely why
the girl should smile with such evident
pleasure into the young ranchers eyes he
racked his brain to imagine the sparkling
wit that must be flowing from youngs
tongue altogether the owner of the bar y
injected enough of the spice of uncertainty
into the occasion to keep blake keyed to
the highest pitch

  but he had a good time until he began
to note that hank was drinking heavily
from some unknown source and was well
on the way to bring further disgrace upon
himself

  blake wondered at his own sensitiveness
to hanks extravagances and noisy appreci-
ation of trivial things he had often seen
hank drinking but it had been in more
lucky moon

ii

fitting circumstances hanks proclivity on
this occasion seemed a monstrous incon-
gruity

  he had not heard that there was any
broached keg he investigated the source
of supply and found that rob white had
a flask or rather a supply of flasks rob
and hank principally were attending to the
consumption

  the effect upon the two was not the same
hank uttered idiocies and laughed with im-
becile joy about nothing he weaved as he
walked and stared owlishly about rob grew
morose and sullen and walked very straight
and deliberately he was a dangerous type
of drinker

  hank never came much farther than the
door he stayed there among a group of
stags and laughed and laughed

  rob ceased dancing for a time then he
began again he met curious eyes with
dignified belligerency and uttered pompous
periods with tangled grammar and sadly
mixed metaphors

  between the two they quickly spoiled
the dance for blake the first effect came
indirectly through betty she followed her
brother with worried eyes all the laughter
went out of her

  blake was dancing with betty rob was
also on the floor blakes attempts at con-
versation fell flat at last he gave up trying
to talk and followed the direction of her
gaze

  at that moment two couples in one of
which was rob collided robs unstable
balance was lost and he fell dragging his
partner down

  hank in his position near the door roared
out his mirth his voice soaring far above
all other sounds in the room he tilted
back his head he rocked on his heels lost
his balance and staggered he bent double
and slapped his knees

  rob rose from the floor couples around
him were smiling some laughing outright
blake saw the boys face grow suddenly
white and murderous he made no effort
to assist his partner he started swiftly
toward the group at the door

  oh betty gasped

  blake sensed what was coming and ran
after him rob went straight toward
hank at the last moment his right hand
brushed back the skirt of his coat and came
up with a gun he raised it over his head
the blue steel glinting and started to strike

  hank under the swift metamorphosis of
drunkenness was transformed by the threat
from a laughing imbecile to a demon but
it is unlikely he would have escaped a stun-
ning blow had blake not reached his
assailant

  as the gun came up blake seized it he
twisted it from robs hand thrust him
sprawling to one side tossed the gun
through the door and met hanks bellowing
rush

  lemme at im hank roared uggggg
his voice suddenly ceased in a strangling
gurgle as blake ducked under his flailing
arms and grasped his shirt collar from be-
hind he jerked hank off his balance and
dragged him out the door and twenty yards
from the building before releasing him

  whatchu think hank began then
paused as he sensed blakes cold ferocity

  that was the end of the dance for blake
he had his hands full with hank fairless
alternately stormed and wept blake
dragged him from the vicinity of the barn
found a straw stack and dumped him
bodily upon it when hank had grown
quiet blake rustled a horse blanket and
threw it over him

  lying near the sleeper he heard the faint
music and laughter going on and on he
grew drowsy at last he didnt know when
the dance broke up

  he was awakened shortly after daybreak
by taylor doing the chores leaving hank
asleep he followed the rancher into the barn

  well said taylor i reckon you young
folks had a good time hope so but im
gittin too old really to enjoy a dance i
pay the next day for losin a nights sleep
didnt use to mind it

  i was going fine blake said till them
fools hank and rob went and spoiled it all

  taylor laughed indulgently

  hank is hair-brained but he dont mean
bad i dont know about rob though ive
been noticin his gun play here lately if
that boy dont git a-holt of hisself hes liable
to wake up some fine morning in serious
trouble id hate to see it on account of his
folks there aint no finer people than the
whites

  hank appeared not long after he was
carrying the horse blanket on his arm he
had straw in his hair a bleary look in his
eyes and cuts and abrasions on his face from
his fall of the previous day he was a sorry
spectacle


adventure

  i want to use all the cold water in your
spring jim he said combing at his tousled
hair with his fingers some party wasnt
it from what little i remember we all
sure had a fine time i did everbody did
but how the dickens i ever mistook that
straw stack for a roomin house is what i
cant figger

v

after breakfast at taylors
the two rode up clear creek to
finish their previous days work
the corrals were a series of log
inclosures at the confluence of two gulches

  they were flanked by two lines of fence
converging at the gate the corrals were
used by stockmen in common for cutting out
and branding cattle and for corraling wild
horses

  as they came abreast of the corrals they
saw two other riders working among the
horses

  look whos here said hank my ol
friends jeff an pete sure as shoo tin
heavy on the word friend if id knowed
they wanted their mustangs rounded up by
grab id uh worked till midnight cuttin out
all the j-j stuff an pushin em clean to the
top uh minidoka dad blame me if i
wouldnt think uh me roundin up cay-
uses free uh charge for jeff jamison

  who are they

  jeff an pete jamison j-a-m-i-s-o-n
jamison me an jeff an pete likes each
other just like buck deers an rattlesnakes is
in love you just watch me one uh these
days jeff is goin to git me riled just right an
well go together like a cranky buck sheep
an a winder pane an its a sagebrush
cinch yours truly wont be the winder pane
hes wise he dont give me scarcely no
chance to call him

  what was the origin and cause of the mu-
tual antipathy hank did not reveal blake
learned afterward that the jamisons owned
a section of land a few miles above browns
holdings on squaw creek hence they
were ranchers of sorts they had a brand
registered for both horses and cattle but
owned not many of either

  ranching was not their sole and settled
occupation they preferred money that
was made in more diverting ways than mere
labor they were first class judges of stock
and were dangerous opponents in a horse
trade just now they were picking from

their horses some of the most vicious to take
to maverick to the fall rodeo on the chance
of selling them for buckers soft from the
summer on the range the animals needed
a few weeks diet of hay and oats to condi-
tion them

  are they still any quarter circle s stuff
in there hank asked in business-like tone
as he reached the corral gate

  yes said jeff jamison briefly he was
a saturnine individual whose lanky frame
suggested strength

  theys some j-j horses too added pete
that line-back buckskin mare is one of
em shes goin to maverick when you
see the name sally patica headlined in the
papers you wont tje readin about the queen
uh the gypsies or no patent medicine
neither itll be referrin to that mare
she can wampoo if you doubt it well
stick your hull on her an you can crawl on
an see for yourself-that is if you have any
time for lookin after she starts

  huh said hank cynically i noticed
her yesterday had a notion to ride er
bareback to taylors dance wouldnt
waste time monkeyin with a imitation like
her if i wanted to see her buck id just
put my understudy here on her an let him
claw her awhile

  im tellin you she aint nothin for boys
an understudies to practice on takes a
he-man an no he-man better be tryin to
ride her to a dance bareback when a un-
derstudy gits on hell crave all the leather
in the state to pull

  oh he aint so bad said hank in
fact he can ride most anything that wears
hair i brung him up from new mexico
with me to put the finishin touches to his
eddication

  well pete put on his best horse trading
manner ive seen good punchers that come
from places all the way from texas to mon-
tana ive seen horses that was raised in
oregon that was snaky buckers this mare
was raised right here shes a idaho bucker
an im willin to bet the fifty bucks i got
from dick young for a saddle horse-a
durned good one too-the other day that
there aint a man in the crowd can ride er
straight up an scratch er

  i wouldnt risk any money bettin you
could do it with difficulty hank re-
strained himself from revealing his joy
like a sick coyote pete had walked right
into the trap id do the mountin but
lucky moon



dont feel like its necessary in this case ill
let blake do it good practice for him
he drew out his purse and examined the
meager contents

  its- to be pore as the old savin

goes a man notices it when he gits a
chancet to double his money or a place to
buy good likker priced fair ive got eight-
een - nineteen - nineteen forty-five if
blakell take the rest well sure relieve you
uh that troublesome fifty

  pete went in and put a rope on the mare
and led her into an adjoining corral she
was easy to handle offering little opposition
to halter or saddle hank snubbed her and
blake mounted

  when the blinder and snubbing halter
were pulled off she merely stood with flat-
tened ears legs spread wide and a hump in
her back that tilted saddle and rider far
forward

  blake touched her with the spurs and
swept his hat across her ears she moved
slowly stepping stiffly as though her legs
were made of sticks she took three of
these short stiff-legged steps then sud-
denly with the speed and snap of a tripped
catapult she went at him she leaped high
and far and fast with tremendous rocking
twisting bounds

  blake as was his unvarying custom went
to work with both feet he rode with an
appearance of looseness maintaining his
place by lightning unerring adjustments of
balance rather than by strength of his legs
he scratched from the points of her shoul-
ders to the skirts of his saddle and fanned
her with his sombrero that was his style
he always scratched as long as he stayed in
the saddle if bucked off he was bucked
off scratching

  hank rode near beating a tattoo on his
horses flank with his crumpled hat yell-
ing

  attaboy blake fan er boy scratch
er

  as though plunging against a cliff she
stopped her hoofs plowing the ground then
around she went spinning in a short circle
like a huge top head low mouth open bawl-
ing and squealing like a fragment thrown
from a whirling disk by centrifugal force
she leaped straight out at a tangent to her
circle thumped the ground on rigid legs
crouched all in one swift continuous move-
ment and hitched back with a terrific
wrenching jerk then forward she went

sunfishing again her lithe taut body twist-
ing and rolling dizzily in the air

  suddenly pete jamison leaped from the

fence where he had been seated hurled his
hat to the ground and yelled joyously-
youre bucked off cowboy

  and so he was blake was still scratch-
ing from the mares tawny mane to the
square skirts of his double rig but he was
palpably off step with her and couldnt
catch up at the next vicious back-hitch
he left the saddle sailing cleanly over her
head

  he landed on hands and feet cool in
the crisis his first thought was to throw
himself from the path of the squealing de-
mon behind him the mare leaped by him
like a streak and kicked viciously in passing
they saw the hoof strike his head heard the
impact he was knocked backward into a
tumbled heap

  blake had an instantaneous impression
of a crashing blow a blinding stroke of pain
that dissolved into a million scintillating
points of light which went out quickly in a
rush of blackness

vi

     jfc when he awoke his first sensa-
  	tion was of a vast rhythmic

         swinging through space borne
lla down by a leaden weight that
dragged on every cell in his body-then he
remembered and tried to complete the con-
vulsive effort he had begun-but he seemed
to be trammeled in the coils of a lariat a
locked spur seemed hanging in a cinch he
struggled to free himself in the face of
deadly danger he was impotent

  he came nearer the borderland of con-
sciousness he realized that a pair of hands
were pressing firmly upon his shoulders a
voice a womans voice was speaking he
opened his eyes his body was tense pain-
fully strained his hands were gripped in
a white coverlet

  a girl with a mass of dark hair with dark
eyes and the reddest of lips was bending
over him she was strangely familiar it
was night an oil lamp burned on a table
beside the bed

  you must be quiet she was saying
youll start the blood again

  blake relaxed wonderingly

  who are you where am i at he
asked weakly


adventure

  i am betty white she told him
dont you remember me they brought
you here after you were hurt do you feel
better	

  dont know he tried to grin head
aches a little more than it did a few minutes
ago-or anyhow i notice it more but my
eyes are working so i can see you yes take
it all around i guess im better but it
took too great an effort to be cheerful his
head throbbed with deadening misery

  im glad she said we were afraid
you were dead when they brought you
here

  his curiosity in things was gone the
light stabbed his eyes he closed them and
dozed in a state between sleeping and wak-
ing the pain in his head visited his sub-
consciousness in weird and horrible dreams
he heard people speaking men and women
hands touched him and there came the urge
to force himself awake but his will was
heavily encumbered

  he received their ministrations passively
he dreamed that his mother who had been
taken when he was barely past his infancy
had laid a caressing hand upon his head
and from it radiated peace in the strange
semi-consciousness he caught fragments of
sentences

  how is he doc the voice associated
itself with the rumble of racing wild horses-
the smoke of a camp-fire

  cant tell-fractured-slight concussion

-tomorrow- blake sank into a deep

slumber

  he opened his eyes to the essential light
of day filtering through crisp muslin cur-
tains in a dream he had been floating in
a sea of melody harmony like a tangible
thing surrounded and permeated him con-
sciousness revealed that some one was
playing a piano something yearning and
sweet

  blake whose durable skull had resisted
the blow and who was recuperating like a
tough wild animal closed his eyes and
yielded to the spell of the music it was
simple enough to be comprehensible to him
but its beauty baffled analysis

  it conjured visions of heroic deeds and
places of wild brave men their roughness
justified and sublimated sunsets flaunting
prodigal color over a wide half world of
sand soft deep blue of desert twilight he
felt himself unscathed life with all its
possibilities stretched before him-action

achievement concrete realizations of vague
ambitions

  his mind reveled then the fire began de-
parting from his dreams images and im-
pulses grew indistinct something had
gone out of him as color fades from the sky
he realized that the music had ceased

  a clock on the table where also stood
medicine bottles and a partly used roll of
gauze told him it was ten in the morning
it was a rather bare room but immacu-
lately clean a rag rug was on the floor
a few lithographs and framed mottos in
bold letters bordered with flower designs
on the wall

  when blake suggested that he felt quite
well enough to return to work he was op-
posed decisively by the whites they were
backed by the authority of the doctor whom
hank after blakes injury had ridden a
horse almost to death to bring so he
entered upon ten days of new and vital
experience

  mrs white was a gray-haired sweet-faced
woman to whom rob bore a striking resem-
blance mark white wore a flowing full
beard black streaked wtih gray he was
benign of face possessed of a grave dig-
nity scrupulously courteous and hospitable
betty to blake by far the most interesting
member of the family was a feminine rep-
lica of what mark white must have been
in his youth

  bob represented a vast disparity in the
family rebellious at the restraints of
his father who had sharply drawn and
somewhat puritanical standards of con-
duct with his first taste of the freedom of
manhood he was drifting toward the other
extreme 

  during childhood his father had relieved
him of the necessity of inhibiting impulses
to misbehavior now he was sampling
with the keen relish of a boy for green apples
some of the fruits of wildness he fre-
quently with callow bravado overstepped
even the liberal standards of the rough com-
munity

  he would have preferred to be the scion
of a cattle-king instead of heir to a one-
horse outfit which his father being little
greedy of possessions beyond the comfort-
able necessities was at little pains to ex-
pand his help was not indispensable at
home and it was little help he gave he
worked for brief periods for widely scat-
tered outfits or he loafed and wasted his
lucky moon



money in any convenient place he came
home when it was advantageous to get his
feet under his mothers table

  at times he was too busy being ambitious
with little direction and no persistence to
his efforts at other times and these most
frequent he was trying with varying de-
grees of success to be tough

  during blakes convalescence rob was
at home for a few days before taking a job
with the l-f outfit located south of riggin
helping in the fall roundup at the family
board he bowed his head mechanically when
his father thanked the almighty for the
food before them and besought him for fur-
ther blessings then rob raised his head
and told blake just how far nibs fell short
of being the ideal saddle horse

  good plug that stockin-legged bay of
yours but too big away too big must
weigh round leven hundred dont he too
heavy on his feet if he was two hundred
pounds lighter hed be just right

  blake turbaned with gauze his eyes
stealing glances toward robs altogether
adorable sister tried to answer with a dis-
interested half of his mind while with the
other and interested half he contrasted her
voice and maimer with those of other girls
he had known

  just as good for his inches as a nine-
hundred-pound horse therefore hes two
hundred pounds better

  too big rob insisted pushes down
too hard on his feet a light horse can get
over the hills like a jack-rabbit hell stove
his shoulders up

  he aint stiff in the shoulders yet and
hes done as much hard work as any horse of
his age in the state said blake defending
his horse automatically while he noted the
bewitching irregularities of bettys profile
if he pushes down harder on his feet at the
same time hes got the legs to hold up extra
weight he can carry a man as easy as a
horsefly i like that

  when hank rode down to see how he was
progressing the talk was likewise carried to
horses

  if that man-killer uh jamisons had been
two-foot farther from you when she let drive
there wouldnt uh been nothin left uh you
but the tombstone id been able to buy with
three cents less than nothin

  you was doin some oily ridin boy the
ten or twelve jumps you stayed with her
gettin bucked off that she-dont spell

nothin i never seen such dizzy steppin
as she done shes-shes a raggin fool
thats all

  but blakes interest in wild horses was in
abeyance and he was glad when the single-
minded hank rode away betty white and
her piano constituted his new mental set

  the instrument had been freighted-in sev-
eral years before at considerable expense
and betty had studied music under her
mother since her earliest recollection blake
could not determine whether music was the
refining influence that had wrought the dif-
ference he saw in her or whether it was
merely an expression of more essential de-
partures from the usual type of frontier
daughters

        vii

blake with a long scar under
his hair where the mares hoof had
split his scalp and seven stitches
had been taken had rejoined
mcalisters outfit on the range

  he had never got so little joy out of work
the range conditions in this north country
were new to him mcalister was bossing
the round-up in person he was a stickler
for easy handling of cattle and he laid down
hard and fast rules against unnecessary rop-
ing and all other forms of rough treatment

  there was little excitement the cutting-
out and branding was all done in corrals so
that one or two ropers did nearly all the
lariat work blake who prided himself on
his ability with the riata-and who had
long ago won hanks profound admiration-
found himself barred satory and modell
who mcalister knew could be depended
upon to obey instructions did the roping

  it was just work and dirty work and long
hours at that they tailed down bellowing
calves wielded the red-hot irons breathed
the pungent smoke of the scorching hair and
flesh ripped mcalisters half-crop in the
left ear underbit in the right and his jug-
handle dewlap under the neck when they
got through ripping ear-marks and dewlaps
and burning the great quarter circle s
cattle brand on the side of a four-months-old
calf that baby steer looked like the pitiful
relic of a catastrophe

  and after a man had been closely con-
cerned with the wreckage of many score of
them in the course of a day he himself was
apt to be black from end to end with blood
and dirt and ashes
l

adventure

  the only ameliorative circumstance to
blake was the fact that he had drawn a
rough string in the cawy he had three
snake-eyed roman-nosed cayuses who
could be depended upon to put up a credit-
able buck any time after a nights rest and
two more that bore watching every hour of
the day

  the restless blake was prone to encourage
rather than to discourage their bucking pro-
clivities he was never rough with the
spurs in his most reckless scratching he
almost never drew blood and seldom ruffled
the hair he was satisfied to go through the
motions but a touchy bronc hates dread-
fully to be tickled on the shoulder on a chill
morning with the toe of a boot or to suffer
the ignominy of having a riders foot taken
from the stirrup where it belongs and set be-
tween his ears

  mcalister objected to that also

  a keen spell of buckin in the mornin
tires a horse as much as three hours ordi-
nary ridin he was wont to say he reit-
erated at every opportunity now look
at harry satory there i aint seen a bronc
really git down an buck with him a dozen
times in the last year hes easy with em
he coaxes the meanness out of em

  which was true satory was a top cow
hand a model blake would have admit-
ted this without an instants hesitation he
would if pressed have defined a model as
a small specimen of the real thing he
readily understood why harry had no am-
bition to compete for the prizes in the ma-
verick rodeos even if he had ever had
been a good rider he wasnt now getting
enough practice on bucking horses to fit
himself for hard competition

  blake was deliberately preparing himself
for the coming show there was much talk
of it around the camp-fire at night and
his ambitions were stirred more and more
though none of the other boys were going
to compete the event loomed big in their
eyes

  mcalister had generously promised to
let most of them off for a few days to ride
over and see at least the finals bucked out
blake intended to quit outright in time to
get to maverick and enter for his chosen
events

  in the face of his employers displeasure
he was getting all the practice he needed to
meet the buckers but he was getting al-
most none with the rope and bulldogging

was clean out of the question even so
aided and abetted by hank who stayed on a
ridge to watch off approaching riders he
grappled with a few of mcalisters peaceful
steers and rolled them upon their fat sides

  in one such scuffle he got his shirt ripped
from collar to belt and a long scratch down
his back he had to frame a pretty story
about an unruly horse and a stiff dead tree
limb projecting downward to spring at sup-
per that night

  altogether the character of blakes work
was not lifting hin to any pinnacles of glory
in mcalisters eyes tom would readily
have admitted that blake was willing that
he didnt have a lazy bone in his body but
he was just simply too-reckless

  and blake wasnt caring what mcalister
thought about him he was in funds very
much so thanks to israel browns and dick
youngs propensity to poker besides that
there was a fine show coming up at maver-
ick a town he had never seen where he had
a chance though a slender one to earn sev-
eral months wages in three days and where
he had an absolute certainty of having his
share of all the fun

  on top of that there was a big dance
coming up at riggin which he planned to
take in despite high water and any and all
other obstacles his interest in the riggin
dance was distinctly private and was not re-
vealed at the camp-fire it had to do with
a certain discovery he had made at taylors
barn dance during his convalescence at the
white ranch

  as regards his connection with tom mc-
alister things were moving toward a climax

         on the afternoon before the
dance they were trailing a herd
ilss toward the corral a rangy mon-
ugrel steer with the legs of an elk
and curving horns twice the length of a
herefords gave vent to his native con-
trariness he whirled from the herd and
broke back tearing down the point of a
ridge into a brushy gulch

  blake and modell pursued and after a
quarter mile run headed him and brought
him back but the sprint only whetted his
appetite for trouble he kept seeking an-
other opportunity to dodge back the last
vestige of blakes patience vanished he
would teach that steer his a b cs if he never
did another thing in his life he gathered
his rope and shook out a noose
lucky moon



  when the steer again broke away blake
wheeled his horse and from the steers left
side snapped a loop over its horns racing
abreast he flipped the rope across the steers
back and drew it tight across the hind legs
then he checked his horse

  the big animals legs were swept from
under him by the taut rope and he struck
ihe ground as though he had fallen from a
cliff blake had busted steers in this man-
ner before the process never failed to ex-
tinguish their desire for mischief in this
case he did more than he had intended in
the fall one of the steers long horns struck
the ground first received the major portion
of the shock and was broken from its head

   blake leaped to the ground tied the ani-
mal and cut away the hide that still held
the broken horn then he prodded the
stunned beast to its feet it went back to
the herd the model of docility shaking its
bloody head

   mcalister came riding over and sat look-
ing at blake as he- coiled his rope then
tom opened up all his verbal batteries he
too had passed the limit of patience

  blake he began youve heered me
say nine hundred an eighty-two times that
that aint my way of handlin cattle it

may be your way but i dont give a-

what your style-- he stopped suddenly
as blake hurled his rope to the ground and
faced him with blazing eyes

   tom he said struggling for composure
and deliberation cut it out before you get
spersonal and start something we might both

be sorry for i dont give a-what your

style of handling stock may be ill save
you the trouble of tying a can to me write
it out pronto

  with hands that shook with anger mcal-
ister got out a check book and scrawled an
order on his bank to pay blake moody the
small sum due him before he had finished
hank was at his side

   figger mine too tom he said cheer-
ully ive got to stay with blake hes
young an ignerent an aint noway capable
uh takin care of himself among strangers

   mcalister exploded

   quit at one seconds notice an leave me

-	hort-handed huh hank this is about the
hirty-fourth time ive hired you but its
he last time he went on at some length
relieving his internal congestion

   hank heard him out grinning blithely

   its too bad tom but its your mistake

since you was turnin loose the best cow
hand that ever tried to pull a pair uh chaps
over spurs with two an a half inch shanks
i figgered you seen fit to prune down your
force

  you know why i was lettin blake go

  yes blake said coldly because i
quit 

  well tom thankee kindly an fare-
well hank said as he received his check
sorry but you cant expect me to let my
young son ride off without me to look after
him

  hank proposed that they start to maver-
ick forthwith but blake opposed him he
was determined to go to the dance at riggin
and at last hank yielded under protest

  the two rode down to riggin

viii

riggin consisted of a couple of
saloons a store in the second
wlviw story of which was the hall where
they danced a feed stable and a
few shacks of rough lumber and tar-paper
straggling over an abbreviated flat

  blake and hank turned their horses over
to a stable-man kicked off their chaps ad-
justed their mufflers and climbed the stairs
to the hall the room was crowded with
what seemed to blake very ordinary men
and singularly unattractive giggling girls
and blowsy matrons

  not much class here he commented
after searching every nook and corner of the
room with his eyes

  oh i dont know said hank  bout
as much as usual anyhow i dont care
it hurts me as bad to have a good lookin
dame tromp on my toes as a hard lookin
one so i steer clear of em all les go
down to the elkhorn an see whats goin
on

  blake followed him down-stairs he had
the feeling that he had ridden down to rig-
gin for nothing

  dont the people from down clear creek
way take in these dances he asked with
admirable nonchalance i didnt see any-
thing of jane-whats her name who played
the organ-or-or any of them girls that
was down at taylors

  so hank stopped dead in his tracks
i might uh knowed if i hadnt been dead
from my shoulders up if youd asked me
i could uh told you that you wont never
i

adventure

find betty white at these roughneck parties
at house-warmins an barn-raisins in the
neighborhood maybe but not these hops
at riggin

   her folks is pertickler-an shes per-
tickler-who she sociates with i aint in
her class as you noticed you wouldnt
be neither if she knowed as well as i do
about your carryin-ons you say there
aint nobody here that was at taylors
that shows you didnt see nobody in that
barn but her theys several here that was
at taylors average good lookin dames too

   if youd feast your eyes on her you just
go to the clear crick school house any sun-
day when sunday school is keepin an
there shell be next time he admonished
with feeling tell me whats on your mind
trust your op sidekick what aint never laid
down on you an maybe he can save you a
long hard ride we might just as well as
not uh been way along on the trail to mav-
erick by this time if we miss gittin there
in time for you to enter blame yourself not
me

   i didnt notice anything stuck-up about
her or her folks blake said they struck
me as dog-gone nice people sure treated
me fine

  i aint runnin the whites down they
are nice people even if they dont predate
the sterlin worth uh my charter the way
they ought to mark white is a prince
word as good as gold he draws his social
fines on moral grounds or tries to

   didnt work any too good in the case of
his son blake observed

   oh thats the result of a little too much
sunday school in the tender years nother
case of a preachers son goin to the bad
but ol rob sure come in handy to the dance
the other night he had a pack horse load
uh bonded goods stuffed in the pockets of
his chaps an coat jim taylors a good
hombre in some ways but hed just nacher-
ally let his company die uh thirst without
battin an eye

  i never asked you hank but did you
come from a long line of ministers

   i never dumb my family tree to find out
what kinds uh limbs it had but i wouldnt
be suprized to find most any kind-preach-
ers bartenders dooks pearl-divers any-
thing but horse thieves wouldnt acknowl-
edge them

  mark white dont know nothin about
robs carryin on nobody tells him he

dont hang around where its pulled off his
mind dont run that way he sort uh gives
a man the benefit uh the doubt till its
proved otherwise instid uh turnin that
system end for end like i do if youd start
goin to sunday school you might even get
away with it

  im going to do that very thing as soon
as i get back from maverick with my new
saddle

  itd be just like you but if you dont
want to dance tonight les sample the likker
an hit the hay some place weve got to
git an early start in the mornin i wish i
was poundin my ear right now

  at the elkhorn hank did not stop with
one sample nor with two a gang from the
l-f among whom was rob white and all
of whom he knew had just arrived by the
time each of them had bought a drink for
himself and the rest they were getting noisy
and hank had changed his mind about the
desirability of sleep

  blake drank meagerly and soberly un-
willing to enter into the spirit of the festivity

  lets go and find some place to flop
hank he suggested for the third time

  say hank addressed the bartender
loudly got any  squirrel whisky

   squirrel no got plenty of 
crow

  i want  squirrel this frost has got
me down here instid uh hittin the trail for
maverick like i exhorted him to now i
want him to wake up an jump around a
little but i dont want him to fly

  rob white went out to where his horse
stood and leaped into the saddle a mo-
ment later with rolling eyes and loud
breathing the horse came through the open
door rob atop of him plying spurs and
quirt and singing in a loud voice-

              my foot in the stirrup

             my hand on the horn

best-cowpuncher

          ever was born-

  his companions glasses rang upon the bar
as they took up the refrain

          with a long id yippi yippi-a yippi-a
          with a long ki yippi yippi-a

  the bartenders poker face showed con-
cern it augered a wild night which before
the end might be strewn with wreckage of
almost every kind rob wore his gun in a
holster on this night on one or two occa-
sions he had done some practice shooting at
lucky moon



lamps his handsome face was sullen and
reckless and he was lingering the butt of his
revolver as he began another verse of the
ancient song-

         went down to chicago-

  then another voice more powerful more
sonorous and compelling lifted a totally dif-
ferent air blake leaning near the end of
the bar with thumbs hooked in his belt was
singing-

       ill take you home again kathleen

       across the ocean wild and wide

to where your heart has ever been-

  blake was grinning sardonically as he be-
gan but the grin went away as he swept into
the spirit of the song there might have
been times when he would have yipped with
the wildest of the l-f boys but on this night
he was in a totally different mood the
mood had been bom when he first heard
betty white at her piano and it had grown
he had come down to riggin in the hope
of dancing with her he put the warmth
and tumult of his own heart into the song
and he took hold of his audience

  they broke short off in the middle of a
line listening they were maudlin and he
almost brought them to tears long before
the end of the first verse there was not a
sound in the saloon except the restless
stamping of robs horse and blakes clear
voice

        he sang through to the end
        some of the boys cleared their
        throats the bartender broke

mm he deep silence

  take your horse outdoors wont you
rob he makes so much noise we cant
hear good then well have one on the
house

  by gum pardner he told blake as the
horseman complied with his request if i
could sing like you can i wouldnt be
tendin bar nor punchin cows neither id
have a good soft job singin in a vawdy-
ville show rakinin gobs uh dough ever
night

thasso agreed the l-f boys humbly

  say blake said rob with deep respect
do you know oh bury me not on the lone
prairie id sure like to hear you get that
off

  me too chorused the l-f boys

  he knows it said hank pridefully
fellers if you can jump up any purty song

that blake dont know then i want to put
in with you hes the niftiest vocal singer
youll find in a months hard ridin

  blake sang it they had another drink
he sang again and again they drank
the saloon filled up from the street all
patronage deserted the competitive place
of business blake in his present tender
mood was a jewel without price to the elk-
horn those present vied with each other
in spending their money they destroyed
no furniture and they swore under their
breath

  blake tired at last of singing quietly
at the end of a song he slipped out and re-
turned to the dance hall where he stood in
a corner near the door looking on

  his deserted companions raised their
glasses and toasted the empty corner they
set them down and debated the title of the
next selection then they discovered his
absence

  shortly after came hank and the gang in
search of him they tramped up the stairs
with a great swishing of chaps and rattling
of spur rowels they located the object
of their search surrounded him and expos-
tulated with him for his desertion in loud
and earnest voices

  they made a great deal of noise and
things began to happen a floor-manager
came demanding order he was tactless
and the manner he assumed most unfor-
tunate

  if you fellers didnt come here to dance
he said anyhow youve got to act decent
an keep your traps shut youre makin
too much noise

  rob white now free of the spell of blakes
vocal singing turned and faced him
squarely

  thasso do you like to see folks dance
he asked mildly

  i aint pertickler the burly floor-man-
ager blustered but i do like silence an
lots of it

  well rob drawled sfunny how many
different kinds of tastes there is now take
me i jus love dancing so he suddenly
barked -you dance

  as he spoke a gun appeared in his right
hand it roared a staggering sound within
the four walls a bullet smashed through
the floor shockingly near the mans left foot
there was an uproar of frightened female
voices and a sudden thundering stampede
from the store below into the street


adventure

  the floor-manager began the execution
of a series of energetic steps totally lacking
in rhythm he seemed bent only on keep-
ing both feet off the floor at the same time

  hank and the others had exploded into
laughter rob had fired twice more through
the floor a determined voice behind them
suddenly rasped

  reach for the ceiling all of you an
keep your mugs that way this is a decent
dance theys ladies here nobody aint
goin to git away with none of this rough
stuff

  the voice belonged to a deputy sheriff
who had appeared at the head of the stairs
he was a surly square-faced man and he
had a gun in each hand the holes in the bar-
rels of which hank afterward swore were
big as stove pipes

  they reached for the ceiling as com-
manded there was nothing else to do
the officer was at their backs with guns
on them and he was entirely within his
rights and duty

  they were disarmed marched down-
stairs and up the street they were halted
before a small building with one barred
window the door was unlocked and they
were shoved in

the imprisoned rioters easily
agreed that this was an unprece-
dented outrage they howled and
 kicked the walls they found the
cot and demolished it they fought over the
blankets and finally went to sleep on the floor
they began to awaken with the dawn
blake said hank we ought to uh
been hittin the trail to maverick by day-
light

  ive been thinking of that a long time
blake grinned it aint any news to me
looks like this deputy has slep in who
is this hombre anyhow if ol sheriff lamb
himselfd been here he wouldnt uh pulled
off nothing like this hes strychnine an
carbolic acid in a fracas but hes got some
judgment

  lamb is off swappin lead with some un-
lucky cuss i reckon said one of the l-f
boys he must uh found this plug-ugly
deputy in jacksons hole or some other
desperado hang-out an brung him here to
reform him but he aint succeedin

  by cracky blake we got to git out uh
here thats all they is to it well be missin
that show anyhow its plumb awful bein

jailed with a gang uh despurt criminals like
these its plumb awful

  this sally raised a violent protest from
the maligned ones and three of them
stretched the fastidious hank upon the
floor and sat upon him

  they waited for the deputy with the pa-
tience of trapped coyotes one of them
tugged at the bars they were set rigidly
another kicked the door it was nail-
studded and firm hank looked around
down and up he took hold of a rafter of
the ceilingless room swung his body up-
ward and kicked the roof the sheeting
bent encouragingly from the blow so he
kicked again and again the crackling of
loosened nails grew into the rending of
broken shingles and boards a board came
loose then another they all scrambled
through the rent and slid to the ground

  the town was just awakening as they
filed down the street the sheriffs office
was locked they sought the deputy at
the restaurant and found him at breakfast

  he kicked his chair backward precipi-
tately as he rose reaching for his holsters
youre supposed to be in the coop
right is right hank said holding up
his empty hands you neednt go smokin
up the room were law-abidin citizens
an believe in abidin by the law when
were in jail were in the calaboose but
we aint done nothin to be kep in the hoose-
gow all summer for weve got to git to
maverick or the showll be helt up an the
crowd kep waitin if you dont let us out
-were givin you fair warnin-were goin
to bust out

  the deputy was not altogether devoid of
a sense of humor

  well since youre here you might as
well eat breakfast save me packin it to
you then well go down an see the judge

ix

they were on the way to mav-
erick at last riding nibs and
deuteronomy toward the clear
creek pass many long miles
of rough trail were before them and their
time was getting short they approached
tom harris run-down ranch

  wonder how ol tom is feelin after the
dance said hank we ought to stop
an say hello to the ol feller he might be
lonesome
lucky moon



  theres no tiling doing blake said
flatly its a fact tom may have got his
old jug filled up again but we aint got time
for you to get tanked up this morning to-
morrows the last day to enter for the con-
tests weve got a horse-killing trip at the
best i only wish we had a relay strung
along with nibs on the last short lap

  i know all that said hank i dont
want only one drink i had too much last
night feel like the dickens today it
wouldnt take long to hit the jug just oncet
if you get off your horse blake threat-
ened ill hop off on top of you and rake
you full length do you get that

  youll git the worst shakin-up you ever
got in your life cowboy if you ever fork me
besides that youll git bucked off an
jumped on with all four feet git that
thats a good hand blake laughed
but ive still got something to call with
if you stop at toms ill ride on and leave
you how do you like that

  that beats me hank admitted mourn-
fully but i would sure like to have about
four fingers of that jug under my belt it
would make the world lots rosier theyve
got the hardest likker in the saloons an the
hardest floors in the jail at riggin of any
town i ever seen

  but cruel fate defeated blakes best ef-
forts as they were skirting harris ranch
in silence a figure came to the door of the
cabin and beckoned to them with frantic
insistence swearing with exasperation
blake followed hank downward

  toms right jaw bristling with a two
weeks growth of beard looked as though
he were trying at one chew to masticate a
whole plug of tobacco he barely recog-
nized hanks extravagantly jovial greeting

  whats the matter tom hank asked
rattlesnake been workin on that jaw
maybe you didnt heed my warnin

  rattlesnake- tom rasped ive

got a tooth thats been achin fer two days
till its developin into big-jaw an givin me
hydrophoby aint slep a wink fer two
nights want it pulled out

  pulled out exclaimed hank tryin
to put us to work as soon as we show up we
aint got time only to take one drink with
you why aint you went down to riggin
to the doctor its a sagebrush cinch we
aint dentists packin around a kit uh tools
i aint got time to argy i want it out
i aint had no way to git to the city cussed

range stallion come an pawed my fence
down agin an led my hosses away rheu-
matics is worsen ever

a new one on me

  howd i know tom shouted losing
all patience blacksmith tongs wire pli-
ers a hammer an cold chisel whatd i
care its got to come out or im due in
the happy huntin- ow he broke off
clasping his jaw

  he dived into the cabin hauled the stone
jug from under the bunk and tilted it to his
lips

  this danged stuff aint got no more kick
than sody pop he said bitterly i could
drink a barrel of it in thirty minutes an
never know i had a drop lessn i could
smell my breath

  let me see said hank you may be
lyin to save your likker anyhow im
strong for sody pop an such truck specially
if its got a wee bit uh body to it he
raised the jug and drank deeply

  your ailments has put you out uh con-
dition to judge likker tom he said kindly
passing the vessel to blake

  blake shook his head irritably

  lets see what we can do with that
tooth he said or rope a horse for him
or something then im going to get to
maverick in time to enter for them con-
tests if i have to sprout wings and fly
yes tom broke in savagely i want
action on this tooth

  hank seized the jug and took three hur-
ried swallows

  all right quit cussin an find some-
thing to pull it with im feelin stronger
now bet two thousand eight hundred dol-
lars i can pull the left lower fang of a five-
year-ol timber wolf with two fingers like
to see the tooth that can git me down

 harris had hobbled desperately into a
lean-to shed they followed there was
a disorderly work bench a primitive forge
and a jumble of rusty tools they exam-
ined tongs pliers and wrenches with their
proposed novel use in mind and discarded
them at last blake found an ancient bul-
let mold which more than any other instru-
ment at hand resembled forceps

here he told hank these are the
best we can do wash em off and try em
try em yourself you found em ill
hold the victim bein strongern what you
are


adventure

  he wont need no holdin tom said
hes the interested party

  back into the cabin they went harris
seated himself on a stool tilted back his
head and opened his mouth as far as the
swelling permitted

  now which is the one asked blake

  right thar harris thrust a grimy fore-
finger into his mouth indicating the general
direction of the right jaw

  blake with the implement of torture and
former molder of leaden slugs in his hand
peered into the orifice he struck a match
to light the dark recesses and harris dodged
precipitately to avoid a blistered nose

  finally after trying various positions
harris was turned toward the door clutch-
ing the edges of the stool with both hands
hank supporting his head blake settled
upon the yellow snag of a molar and inserted
the improvised forceps

  ugh-gug-gurgle tom moaned as
blake gave a tentative tug with the twelve
inch handles for leverage the senile tooth
gave way and was lifted out

  oh lardy said tom feelingly with his
face in his hands

  that dont sound like hes cussin said
hank i know he aint prayin i reckon
hes just givin mild expression to what he
thinks is awful pain shows tom is losin
his nerve in his old days

  here take some uh this ginger ale
tom he said more sympathetically
hows she feelin now better guess
well have to hand it to ol blake its a
sagebrush cinch the world lost a good den-
tist when he took to punchin cows

  fine said tom without enthusiasm
wall i dont know she still pains he
inspected the tooth which blake had laid
on the table and addressed it  boy you
stood by me noble fer fifty or sixty year
tearin up beef buffaler steaks an venison
crackin nuts an grippin good seegars but
youve shore been raisin the mischief the
last two days

  now blake said hank as soon as i
swaller another little sample uh toms good
sody pop we can be on our way weve
lost a little time but weve done tom
an hank a lot uh good thats a sagebrush
cinch

  blake strode desperately to the door
where he was arrested by a loud groan from
tom

  ugghhh tom prospected again with

his finger why you-you- that

aint the tooth a-tall words failed him
he glared wildly

  well by the looks of it its a sagebrush
cinch it was ready to come anyhow hank
said you aint lost nothin valuable
but well git the real villain if we have to
yank em all out

  now you wipe that grin offn your face
an be keerful young feller tom told
blake as he picked up the molds again if
you jerk out any more sound teeth fer me
youll never git to maverick

  if you dont keep your mouth open
blake warned theres no tellin what im
liable to get a-hold of im just as anxious
to get this over with and ride off before
hank gets laid out as you are

  sound teeth said hank tom you
aint had a sound one in your head since
you shed your colt teeth

  blake exercised care and made sure of the
offending member as he put the mold
over it tom flinched so violently that he
overturned the stool and went backward to
the floor with an awful crash

  hold on blake knelt upon him for
the first time weve really got in shape for
action lay right there

  as he started to pull harris began to rise
hank heartlessly pressed him back upon the
floor and with laudable presence of mind set
one foot upon his forehead and one upon his
wildly waving right arm holding him prone
and helpless

  now go he told blake

  and to an accompaniment of smothered
imprecations and inarticulate blasphemies
blake went and the tooth went with him

the drafted practitioners of
dental surgery watched harris
rise slowly balefully from the
floor he spat a mouthful of
blood as he started toward the antlers
where his rifle rested hank seized and
thrust him into a chair holding him until
the homicidal impulse had passed

  it shore feels better he said relaxing
glad you got it les see that jug now
if it aint empty

  danger averted hank collapsed he
roared strangled and coughed he sank
helplessly to the floor where he rolled and
howled with his arms clasped over his abdo-
men

  tom eyed him with profound disgust
lucky moon



  you must think its danged funny
young feller ive got my private opinions
of a man that laffs at the tortures of his fel-
ler humans

  hanks paroxysm of mirth gradually sub-
sided and he rose to his feet wiping his eyes

  for-s sake lets go hank said

blake from the door

  all right but first ive got to have one
more little shot uh this nerve tonic that
was tryin labor

  im shore glad you boys come by tom
said gratefully you done me the world
of good when it comes right down to it
without no more practice than youve had
you know more about pullin teeth than
nine out of ten of these new-fangled mouth-
doctors an that aint sayin much fer
you he added as an afterthought did
i ever tell you about that danged dentist
that wanted to pull all my teeth good ones
along with the rest after my money

  if you have a lot of luck over to the ro-
deo an happen to git aholt of a gob of easy
money dont fergit what i told you about
the wisdom of investin in some good prop-
erty it cant git away from you if you do
that of course thered be a little fixin-up
fer you to do around the buildins an corrals
and so forth but ive got a hundred acres of
as good land as ever laid out of doors an
worlds of range jest off the back yard

  a little fixin said hank you mean
a lot uh fixin do you think we want our
wife to be sooin for divorce the first day
but well like as not buy the ranch when
we git back twine string-an toothpick-
fences an all ive talked to blake like a
father about the evils uh matrimony with
tears in my eyes big as baseballs time an
time agin but it dont do no good

  here lately hes aimin to git married
he rode ah the way to riggin to dance with
one dame she wasnt there an he got so
blue i had to git the deputy sheriff to take
his gun off him an lock him up to keep him
from commitin sideways

  i dont doubt it said tom when a
young feller dances with one gal all night
dont notice none of the other young ladies
its nigh time he was fixin up a place to
raise his family in

  good bye hank blake called from the
yard ill tell you how maverick looked
when i get back

  im cornin hank yelled as he seized
the jug hurriedly just three seconds

blake for a taste uh this ice cream sody an
ill be with you

  hank weaved to his horse swung into the
saddle and gripped his knees under the swell
of the fork then he defied all the laws of
gravity

  blake he said i love you like a broth-
er i love you like four brother an three
sisters i want you to git to maverick in
time to win that silver mounted rig moren
you do therefore im goin to do some-
thing for you you aint afraid of a rough
trail are you

  no blake had tumbled from the rag-
ged edge of his patience hank in the

name of-s bald-headed bartender shut

up and lead out i could ride to maverick
by way of kansas city before youd get
through talking

  all right cowboy well go north instid
of east for a ways im goin to maverick
the way a crow would fly if he had any
brains-the shortest way

  ill lead you over a trail thatll make
your eyes bug out till you could knock em
off with a pitchfork handle where if ol nibs
steps six inches too far to one side hell
roll a mile down a hill so steep a magpie has
got to put on britchin before he can fly
down

  they followed stock trails northward
around mt minidoka to blue river and
turned up the canyon as they advanced
it grew steeper and steeper the walls more
abrupt the stream more precipitate tum-
bling boiling down an unending series of
rapids soon they approached the mouth
of a black gorge which the water had
slashed through the granite buttresses of
the range like a wound here it is swirled
among and over giant boulders falling
against a cliff on one side recoiling to a
wall of black rock on the other

  hank leading turned in his saddle grin-
ning with sardonic glee and shouted some-
thing but his voice was drowned in the
thunder of falling water he turned from
the stream and pushed his horse up a
treacherous shell rock slide then followed
a ledge around the cliff so narrow that a
horse had almost to walk on air with jag-
ged rocks and white water a hundred feet
below whenever possible to take his eyes
from the trail he looked back grinning

  blake shut his teeth and followed without
visible hesitation he stayed on his horse
though on the narrowest parts of the shelf


adventure

he had to take his feet from the stirrup on
the inside and draw up his leg while nibs
trembling rubbed his side along the rock
utilizing every inch of space

  they passed the point and found a breath-
ing space here the cliffs bent back form-
ing a tiny almost circular valley where
the stream flowed smoothly through quiet
pools and for a hundred yards the going
was easy

  whatd you think of it hank asked
that was just a starter

  i thought you said you was going to
show me a rough trail and here you go lead-
ing off down a reglar bowlyvard

  you aint kiddin me i could see the
ol eyes buggin out this trail cowboy is
the hank fairless trail nobody as i
know of dont know nothin about it-
dont even know its name you ask jim
taylor or tom mcalister or satory or any
of em an theyll tell you blue canyon aint
passable for cow steer bull or cayuse-
aint passable for nothin except cougars an
bob cats

  but ol hank fairless dont beleve all
he hears or even much of what he sees he

tried this trail oncet when he was in a-

of a hurry to git to maverick an hes
just as much alive as ever-though its a
fact he aint growed much since this way
its only bout thirty five miles from whites
ranch to hitchcocks basin aginst seventy
around by clear crick

  at the upper end of the little valley they
left the creek bed zigzagged up the right
hand wall and went onward along the
almost perpendicular mountain side their
trail was at the upper rims of sheer walls of
rock cliffs above fearsome depths below
from which came the subdued thunder of
cataracts the broken deer trails they
followed dropped or climbed abruptly past
fallen trees and impassable points of rock

  it was late afternoon when they emerged
from the canyon into a high basin green
with lush wild grass in a setting of giant
peaks blue river headed there leaving
the basin on the west in a sheer drop of a
hundred feet the streams following the
canyons between the peaks on the north and
east also found their sources in the springs
fed by the rotting drifts in the clefts of
the naked peaks

  they camped that night in the meadow
and at sundown next afternoon were in
maverick

     x

it was a cow town of two thou-
sand inhabitants normally the
population now enormously in-
increased by the show stock-
men and punchers had gathered in some
hundreds of horses who harbored inveterate
antipathy to anything on their backs

  many fleet horses were there to be ridden
in races by cowgirls and squaws cowboys
and nez perce braves there were long-
horned long-legged wild and nimble steers
to be turned loose in the arena for ropers
to perform on and bulls that were deemed
unridable

  it was a goodly place and goodly time
several days given over to festivity while
sober business was laid aside and people
swarmed in for the fun the streets were
full of horses bearing indians in ancestral
paint and feathers and cowboys gorgeously
appareled

  a lot of them couldnt ride a ringboned
knock-kneed spavined jackrabbit said
hank with a disapproving eye on the bril-
liant silk shirts and mufflers but they
think they look like seven hundred dollars
on a gentle horse

  blake turned his jaded horse over to a
stable-man with brief and decisive instruc-
tions about oats blanket and above all
special care at the watering trough until
nibs had cooled off he dropped a dollar
tip into the mans hand and hurried to the
rodeo headquarters there he signed up
and paid his entrance fees for the bucking
bulldogging and roping contests then for
the first time in two days his mind was free
of anxiety

  they had two days to kill before the show
opened on the night of the second day
blake and hank seeking diversion  in
different lines were separated near mid-
night somewhat the worse for many drinks
hank found blake at a table in a crowded
back room he was bucking a blackjack
game against a worried dealer a great
pile of counters coins and bills were before
him rob white was playing at the table
also but his visible supply of wealth was
not large

  as hank shouldered his way to blakes
side he saw jeff and pete jamison and two
or three of the l-f boys in the crowd

  your pardners goin strong one of the
l-f hands told hank hes blame nigh
lucky moon



made a porper out uh that twenty-one
dealer if theys enough money bade uh
the game an his luck holds he can buy the
house before mornin

  oh boy hank whispered ecstatically
enough kale to buy all the likker in the
world

  he watched blake betting the limit draw
two face cards the dealer turned over
nineteen rob had also bet the limit and
his cards counted seventeen

  hank had no time to sympathize with
rob

  pay us he shouted smiting blake
between the shoulders oh whiteface
steers an bunch grass whats the use uh
workin

  the cards were dealt again this time
blake drew an ace and a king rob had
drawn to a face card and four spot he
drew a jack which made him too many

  twenty-one bellowed hank thats
the name uh the game pay us oncet an a
hah

  the dealer drew in the last of robs
money added more to it and paid blake

  rob looked on for a few minutes and saw
blake win time after time with a marvelous
run of luck then he walked over to jeff
jamison

  ive been in town three hours jeff
now im broke ive got to have some jack
or i might as well leave lend me fifty

  not to buck no games with the satur-
nine jeff told him bluntly you cant
play cards for sour owl grease

  i dont want to gamble any more

  well sure but no poker or blackjack
mind you

  much bliged jeff if i never pay you
youll always have it coming so youll never
be without resources

  oh i aint afraid about gettin paid
if you have trouble savin up that much
coin you can do some work for me help me
out some way well figure out some way
so it wont be too hard for you to pay it
back

  -of a note for mark whites son to

be suffering for want of spendin money
the old mans a good injun but he aint the
fastest money-maker in the world by a long
shot he hit this country a long long time
ago he had just as good a chance to pick
up a quarter of a million as that stiff-necked
old grouch of an is brown but he didnt
do it and the result is i cant pay my way in

a fast game moren thirty minutes at a
time

  rob had drunk three stiff highballs be-
fore sitting into the blackjack game

  ive got a picture of mark white finan-
cin any gamblin for you if he had three
quarters of a million jeff grinned sourly
not unless you frisked his pockets

  blake was still winning and hank was at
his side gesticulating and uttering loud
profane ejaculations of joy but a thing
as good as that couldnt last forever the
dealer grinning gamely paid a final bet
and announced the game broke

  aw thats luck for you hank wailed
just when we git to cashin in the mint
breaks down

  but his eyes shone as blake scooped his
small fortune into his hat filling it to the
rim and counted the money over to the bar-
tender to be put into the saloon safe

  the house drank on him twice from
wealthy cattlemen to mooching stew-bums

  whats the use uh workin reiterated
hank as he tossed down the second drink
i travel with a ranny what rides with the
new moon shinin on his right shoulder
seems to be a lot better playin cards
than bustin broncs observed the satur-
nine jeff jamison

  huh hank whirled upon him he
can play cards thats a sagebrush cinch
but the way he plays cards aint nothin to
the way he can claw a high-steppin mus-
tang ive got-les see how much i got
that says he wins the saddle im backin
ol blake moody even aginst the field

  he dug to the bottoms of his pockets and
found thirty-two dollars and a few cents
he slammed the coins upon the bar

  now back up your talk cover that
thirty-two bones an two bits put up or
shut up

  you seem to be forgettin that sally
patica aint dead yet jamison said as he
placed the equivalent of hanks total
wealth in the bartenders hands

  huh hank had forgotten but he came
back bravely whatd i care for that
line-back crowbait blake can ride er
bareback with slick heels hes onto her
style now

  i see him git off her style once in short
order and for the benefit of the crowd
jeff briefly sketched the incident in the
clear creek corral and emphasized hanks
loss of his last dollar


adventure

  the laugh that jeffs recital provoked led
hank off the subject for effective repartee

whats the matter with you
jeff is youve got a ringbone in
your brain your thinker when-
ever you try to use it-which

-knows aint often-cripples along like

a stove-up stage horse

  youll have a ringbone in your jaw if
you keep on runnin off at the mouth much
longer jamison threatened angrily

  you aint man enough to put it there
hank stated belligerently thrusting out
his face trouble started immediately

  jamison swung going clear to missouri
for the wallop it was a powerful blow but
badly directed the fist missed the jaw
and damaged itself on hanks adamantine
skull

  almost instantly the fighters were in a
circle a scant two paces wide walled by a
close-packed mass of men a six foot ring
was room enough for fairless and jamison
they fought without science standing toe
to toe and launched awkward blows driv-
ing them with all the weight of their
strength and enmity into unprotected heads
and bodies eyes puffed noses and lips
bled all their genuis was for offense none
for defense ultimate victory was purely
a question of which could longer endure the
punishment

  five minutes of whirlwind action and
they both were nearing exhaustion they
moved closer glaring snarling smote each
other clutched and swayed straining from
side to side each bent on getting the other
nethermost upon the floor

  pete jamison edged around to where
blake stood in the inner circle

  its even aint it said pete

  looks like it

  what say we stop it no use to let
the danged fools beat each other to death
the crowds gettin a danged sight more fun
out of it than they are

  suits me get ready to grab your man

  he waited until pete wrapped his arms
around his brother then he shot out an
arm seized hank by the shirt collar and
jerked hank was torn from his adver-
sarys clinch and overbalanced blake ran
backward through the crowd and out the
door hank could not regain his equilib-
rium and could only wave his arms wildly
sputtering and strangling

  youre a fine friend he stormed when
blake released him just when im gittin
him where i want him you drag me off uh
him why didnt you let me beat that
guy to death main reason i come back
to this--forsaken country

   i felt sorry for him blake said inspect-
ing hanks beefy face besides i want
you to herd the buckers for me tomorrow
now lets find a restaurant and get a
good thick steak raw for that map of
yours

   ill herd the buckers for you all right
but some uh these days when youre drag-
gin me off uh somebody youre goin to
make a miss lick an choke me plumb to
death hank felt of his throat then
youll feel dog-gone sorry whenever you
ride by my grave

  the biggest danger comes when im
draggin you from under somebody blake
said

xi

blake rode two hard and showy
buckers the first day scratching
even more recklessly than any
reasonable judge would have re-
quired between whiles he dived from the
galloping nibs and grasped the horns of
speeding steers he brought them up
standing then hurled them from their feet
while judges held stop-watches on him and
lay in the wide hollow of horns holding them
with teeth clenched on bovine lips his arms
extended he roped and tied steers against
time

  the second day was a repetition of the
first except that the contestants against
whom he rode were fewer in number and
more skilful than had been the average of
the day before

  on the first day jamisons buckskin mare
eliminated three of his competitors for the
saddle by rolling them ingloriously in the
dust and on the second two more she
unloaded them good riders though most of
them were so quickly and with such small
expenditure of energy that the management
used her again and again

  she was a wise outlaw who never strug-
gled against rope halter or saddle but
conserved all her wind and strength to use
against the rider

  on the third day with the semi-finals
bucked out the contest narrowed down to
the final three blake and hank were at the
lucky moon



rear side of the arena where the corrals and
stables were located

  hank was sober and more palpably nerv-
ous than blake his anxiety was touching
they heard a rider and horse announced

  strychnined heely monsters said
hank wish that broom straw of a slim
doke could uh drawed that line-back streak
uh greased lightnin shed boost him into
the bleachers by golly blake they was
two chances in three aginst you gittin her
accordin to the luck you been playin in so
far you surely wont draw her i want you
to git a good horse a horse that jumps so
hard an crooked an high that only bout
two men in the world can stay in the saddle
three jumps but i dont crave to see you
mount a horse that no man can ride its
good night nurse for the hombre they put up
agin them jamisons epsom salts

  they saw the outlaw one shoestrings by
name led into the arena head high ears
twitching mane tossing they watched
slim doke mount and they saw him make
a beautiful ride on the lean black horse who
with his lightning crooked leaps had had his
share of the conquests in the past two days

  listen at the danged fools yell hank
snarled as the grandstand and bleachers
rocked with cheers of approval a sick
chinyman could ride that rockin horse
sideways

  the vanquished outlaw was led away
doke stood before the grandstand and
bowed sweepingly to the applause

  listen the megaphones began bawling
that the next rider up would be blake
moody on sally patica oh my pore
orphant children hank groaned who
said little hank an blake could ever have
any luck

  ive knew it ever since last night was
blakes astounding statement when i
pulled her name out of a hat im tickled
to death the bird that rides that mare
will win the saddle whether hes the best
rider or not

  a mighty cheer had come from the
crowd both names had become very fa-
miliar during the past two days blake as a
graceful daring rider the mare as an un-
ridable bundle of erratic steel springs bound
in pale yellow hide blake and the wild
mare were stars in the barbaric show

  hank did not share the pleasurable thrill
of the crowd

  boy he said glumly the ol moons

sure failed us if i had a moon that
brought me luck by gittin my dome caved
in got me jailed an my charter an pocket-
book damaged without no cause led me up
till i could touch the horn of a five-hundred-
dollar silver-mounted saddle with the tips
uh my finger nails an then wouldnt let me
walk off with it boy id lay off uh that
moon

  dont you think im going to ride the
buckskin

  no do you

  watch me

  you mean to have my rope ready to
drag you out from under her after you

hit the ground that she--s a female

steamboat i know you can ride blake
ride with the best of em but ive got my
doubts about any ranny stickin her out
without lockin his spurs hobblin his stir-
rups an pullin leather with both hands
she-she aint human thats all an the
man she bucks off aint goin to win no
saddle

  youre about as cheerful as a starving
buzzard today blake told him you
dont scare me but you sure do give me a
pain

  hank carried blakes saddle in one hand
as he rode down before the crowd blake
in scarred chaps and drab flannel shirt
walked beside him the mass of human-
ity in grandstand and bleachers shouted
and waved to the gladiators

  then silence settled down as they waited
for hope to be realized or blasted for all
from the purest tenderfeet to the critical
judges knew that this ride if successful de-
termined the championship the mare had
seemed unconquerable already she had
eliminated riders two at least among the
five championship caliber if blake stayed
with her the decision was foreordained

  hank took the halter rope and drew the
mares nose up the horn of his saddle an
attendant cinched on the rig while blake
watched carefully then to all appear-
ance perfectly cool he swung into the saddle
settled his feet in the stirrups and grasped
the single rope rein

  good luck cowboy said hank tragi-
cally as he unsnapped the snubbing halter
to draw it off

  quit crying turn her loose and watch
us go blake said grimly

  hank jerked off halter and blinder and
swung his horse away


adventure

  the mare went instantly into action
with a deep-throated bawl she leaped high
and far twisted in the air like a great cat
and struck the ground at right angles to the
direction she had started gathering her-
self without an instants loss of time the
second leap began as the first ended and
again and again twisting snapping striking
the ground with her forefeet at such an
angle that her shoulders were almost on the
ground only her unbelievable strength
and agility enabled her to hold her feet at
all

  few men in the crowd-though many had
spent their lives on the range-had seen
such bucking

  and blake- as hank watched fear
for his friend went away and frenzied delight
took its place blake was staying in the
saddle swaying easily to the brain-addling
twisting of the horse his sombrero was
brushing the mares ears and hips and each
time she left the ground his boots described
a long arc between her neck and the skirts
of his saddle

  she had bucked him off once fairly but
in that and in a half dozen succeeding ex-
hibitions she had revealed her style to him
on this day before the frantic crowd he rode
fanned and scratched her to a finish out-
guessing her through all her sunfishing
pivoting back-hitching and crooked plung-
ing until she was beginning to slow up from
exhaustion and hank at a sign from the
judges galloped alongside and lifted him
from the saddle

when they left maverick blake
was riding the silver-mounted
saddle he had received the cash
which was part of the prize in the
bucking contest he had second prize in
the bull-dogging and first in the steer-
roping altogether with those prizes and
his winnings in the blackjack game he was
heavy with wealth and local fame

  now what do you aim to do with all the
money an notoriety you got in this mans
country hank asked as they rode away
im beginnin to git worried about you
ill never say nothin agin the moon no
more

  im going to leave the jack in the bank
for the time being and enter for first money
in the clear creek sunday school

  i suppose youre just tryin to kid me
hank said but i cant tell you might be

just that foolish and with that moon
backin you i aint got a doubt you could be
the biggest preacher in the world in thirty
days if you tried an married to the queen
uh spain in the bargain

  i wish id never said nothin about
sunday school to you i didnt mean no
harm it just sort of slipped out when i
said it still if you do go wrong my con-
science will always hurt me

xii

             the sunday following his re-
	turn from maverick blake dressed

           himself carefully in the thoroughly
presentable suit he had bought in
the rodeo town and rode to the clear creek
school house on nibs and his new saddle

   before he reached it the frontier temple
bell was tonguing the call to worship with
more trepidition than facing the redoubtable
outlaw had evoked he entered the school
room and striving to be inconspicuous
took a seat far in the rear where-in his
isolation he loomed like an unskilfully
blotched brand

   his eyes swept the little congregation and
located her betty was in virginal white

   blake was not allowed to remain long in
isolation he was made welcome and intro-
duced into the young peoples class vyhich
consisted principally of young women he
tried his best to bear himself with dignity
and poise and the effort made him a very
quiet young man

  after the meeting the folks crowded
around him to his unmitigated discomfort
insisting that he promise to come again

  mark white did more than that he
came down the aisle with his wife and
daughter betty greeted him shyly mrs
white in motherly manner inquiring par-
ticularly after all the details of his health
mr white shook blakes hand warmly and
said he was glad to see him lending other
young fellows a good example and ac-
tually invited him home with them to dine

  of such luck blake had not dreamed it
was nothing short of a miracle-or moon-
magic

  there were other guests two neighbor
families blake learned that the whites
always kept an open house on sunday

   there were at first no other men except
the husbands and fathers of the two families
among whom was jane comptons father
lucky moon



but a little later in the afternoon to blakes
downright annoyance appeared dick
young

  he came into the house smiling with
what seemed to blake a proprietary air
his expression changed somewhat at sight
of blake

  hello young

  howre you moody i hear you packed
off about everything that was loose around
maverick

  i left the recreation park blake said
so somebody else would have a place to
work next year hows things around the
bar y

  not the best in the world lost a year-
lin with blackleg the other day sent to
the outside for a veterinary if i was a
good poker player and bronco-buster be-
lieve id just quit ranching

  that was something of an underhanded
thrust since anything in the nature of
gambling was taboo in the white home

  well said blake his eyes level and un-
smiling i dont claim to be extra good at
either one but if you decide to make the
change ill do all i can to find somebody fit
to give you lessons

  between the two young men there was no
apparent difference in station no longer
did young eclipse blake in the matter of
apparel he had paid a tailor at maverick
a sum running into three figures for a per-
fectly fitting suit if anything his clothes
were in better taste than the ranchers fully
as rich and less pretentious

  dicks arrival brought temporary re-
straint upon the younger members of the
party jane strove to dispel it

  she commanded betty to sing and
betty sang a simple love song to her ac-
companiment she commanded young
who had listened entranced to sing

  lord jane he said you know i
dont know anything thats fit to sing
and you know i couldnt sing it if i did
id rather just listen

  so should we we like to be entertained
as well as you havent you learned that
in this life the piper must be paid surely
you are willing to pay your share

  that aint fair jane young said
flushing and with secret joy blake re-
membered hanks characterization of the
afflicted and highly endowed girl

  she dont care a whoop how hard she
shoots it into a feller hank had said

  darn it jane young weht on no-
body ever saw me try to squirm out of pay-
ing my way when i had anything to pay
with but i dont propose to stand up be-
side that pie-ano and beller for your amuse-
ment

  isnt it dreadful dick said jane to
be summoned to a path of glory and then be
found wanting

  in youngs flushed face was unqualified
exasperation

  now blake jane said if you fail me

-i dont care how poor your effort may be
so its honest-if you fail me outright im
going to scream and tear my hair what
will you sing she smiled at him impishly

dont know blake rose to his feet
play it

  her slim fingers fluttered over the keys
and there came forth the first bars of a
hymn

for the descendants of the pio-
neers who builded these united
states bankers butchers brokers
and cowpunchers the ringing old
hymns are part of their heritage no one
would ever have committed the error of
ranking blake as a churchman perhaps
choirs had sent their voices to him through
open windows as he passed it may be that
salvation army lassies had sung the hymn
into his memory-and blakes memory had
been peculiarly fashioned for the retention
of songs and airs-from before saloons in
cow towns

  jane looked over her shoulder with the
mischievious smile as she began but as
blake launched into the song her smile gave
way to a look of wonder

when we walk with the lord in the light of his
      word

   what a glory it sheds on our way

when we do his good will he abides with us still

   and with all who will trust and obey

  she played one verse and the chorus
then paused and by a coincidence that to
blake seemed too striking to be accidental
struck into the prelude of ill take you
home again kathleen he saw in it an
omen of the goddess fortune who had
been smiling so persistently upon him
and all his self-assurance rushed back
to him

  if he had sung well at the elkhorn he
was a scintillating artist in mark whites


adventure

parlor his voice was a baritone of sur-
prizingly good quality and range and he
sang with feeling as he finished jane
turned on her stool

  you can sing you can sing you are
quite the most wonderfully versatile cow-
boy i have ever known-not even excepting
richard young but then dick is a ranch-
er anyway

  however i have no doubt you well
know how wonderful you are she turned
back to the keyboard

  then fate which seemed dogging youngs
footsteps that day smote him one of his
men came galloping on a sweaty horse with
news that the looked-for veterinary had
arrived at the bar y with a proposal for
wholesale and indiscriminate injection of
blackleg serum into all the numerous indi-
viduals of the herd dicks immediate
presence was urgently required

  he made his adieus without the best
grace in the world and rode away

  blake tried his utmost to feel sorry that
the deadly malady was threatening the
cattle of that section but the best he could
do was to feel profound relief that young
had gone

  the old folks came in to listen and to
give unstinted and sincere praise the
afternoon was briefer than an hour in the
saddle at the tail of a bawling herd

  blake with betty and jane walked along
the road beside the river the sun was
dropping down to the jagged crest of the
seven devils the color that was rising
in the sky was mirrored in the stream the
coral and amethyst the jade and royal
purple there was magic in the time and
place and the witchery was stealing into
blakes soul

  they were three young of the species
with youths understanding of the moods of
youth jane voiced blakes restlessness
she hummed a sentimental air then-

  i wish we had the piano out here beside
the water id like to hear blake sing un-
der the sky the acoustics of that little
room arent right for his voice you must
serenade me some moonlight night blake
and sing juanita bring with you some-
one who can strum a guitar you dont
need really to mean it just sing as though
you do thats all i ask imagine me
betty if you wish

  isnt the world just achingly beautiful
i wish i were a great poet or a lovely and

talented actress with a voice sweet as a
silver bell how do you like this and
she declaimed

   -and like the baseless fabric of this vision

  the cloud-capped towers the gorgeous palaces
  the solemn temples the great globe itself

   yea all which it is inherit shall disolve

   and like this insubstantial pageant faded

  leave not a rack behind we are such stuff
  as dreams are made of and our little life
  is rounded with a sleep

  blake had never read the tempest
but he knew that the bard had spoken
truly he felt poignantly the transiency
of all things colored days that passed
never to come again opportunities that
would not be repeated before the day
of doom

  the rattle of mr comptons two-seated
carriage sounded behind them mingled with
the quick hoof-beats of his light driving
team blake handed jane into the vehicle
while the spirited horses champed their
bits and pranced goodbys were said the
bays were given rein blake and betty
were alone in the magic twilight

  isnt she a wonderful girl betty said
looking after the departing carriage

  blake did not answer but the intensity of
his gaze drew her eyes to his

  a penny for you thoughts she said
do you know he said with fine irrele-
vance im beginning to like your sunday
school i never knew before that sunday
school was so darn interesting

  you must have begun to change very
recently she smiled i heard of your
luck at maverick if sunday school and
the chance to ride a wild horse conflict
which will you choose

  not the horse ive reformed im
going to buy a ranch save my money and
be rich and stingy and good the rest of my
life

  this wonderful reformation doesnt
seem to have worked much change in your
appearance i suppose its still all below
the surface you look no better-i mean
no different

  but i am just the same im a dif-
ferent man say do you like poets better
than bronco-busters

  i never knew one please dont ask me
to believe that you are out to win a saddle
writing poetry

  i aint got that far in fact im just
beginning to feel the need of poetry the
lucky moon

i

thoughts in my head are quite a bit like a
band of nevada mustangs thats just been
hazed oil the desert down a canon and into
a willow corral they hadnt known was
there here they are milling snorting
circling the fence looking for a way out
youve got to get a good rope on said mus-
tang and jerk a few kinks out of him before
hes any good

  thats where poetry comes in when
thoughts like ive been having the last few
weeks get corraled in my head ordinary
words are no better than binding twine-
cant hold em poetry is the good riata
that hauls the front legs out from under em
and holds em down for the saddle when
youve got something to say thats way
way above the average ordinary words
dont turn the trick

will you let me tell you some
poetry its almost as good as
what jane was saying

  surely she said naturally
im terribly interested in these mustang-
thoughts of yours

  blakes eyes were unsmiling

  i suppose you think i didnt mean what
i said about your sunday school i do
though till just lately i never thought
much about immortality but i like the idea
this life is a good show-hills winds des-
erts people having fun and trouble and
good horses but its too short no soon-
er do we start to live than we get old and
ready to die immortality-i like it may-
be we can get another whirl at the game in
another life

  why of course she said seriously i
supposed everybody believed in a future
life i dont want to die i want to live
forever and i want the things i love to
live forever jane and-and i like my piano
better than a harp

  but dont you like to live just the way
things are on this old world cant you
have a cracking good time no matter how
far we may be living from heaven

  why yes surely im happy-that is
most always

  now in regard to this poem-i aint
claiming i wrote it im using somebody
elses riata to rope my ideas hes got
a better rope than mine he can get hold of
the thoughts say what i mean better than
i can but its mine now it says ex-
actly what i want to say

 his voice flexible and colorful gave good

 expression to the poem

 a norsemans ship on a norsemans sea

 and the grim gray northern sky

 a straining sail and a line of shields
 as the freezing waves fling by

 i was the norseman and prayed to thor
 in the seas of the berg and floe

 and you were a maid on the homeward shore
 in the days so long ago

 a flush stole into her face this is just
 a poem isnt it

 yes a poem thats got my thought
 in a noose

 a breathless sea and a setting sun
 and the end of a losing fight

 just a sinking ship and a norsemans death

 then a silent northern night

 i was the norseman with many more
 i answered the call below

 and you were a maid on the homeward shore
 in the days so long ago

 you are choosing less picturesque ways
 to die in your reincarnation she tried to
 break him from his seriousness an
 outlaw horse doesnt compare in romance
 with a norsemans galley

 listen

 in other lives in other times

 i have loved you and wooed and won

 we have lived and loved with the old old love
 till each short life was done

 through endless life through endless time

 while the deep tides ebb and flow

 we shall love and meet on the homeward shore
 as we did so long ago

 she could summon no light repartee
 with which to meet him her eyes had
 fallen color played in her cheeks

 the light had dimmed to deep twilight 
 there was silence except for the murmur of
 the stream and the whisper of a scented
 breeze

 thats you and me betty blakes
 vibrant voice had grown husky when i
 first seen you i knew you ive loved you
 for a million years

 the red lips for which he had hungered
 met his then she struggled from his
 arms

 blake i wont be swept away like this

 i wont i wont i hardly know you i
 dont know who you are nor where youre
 from nor what you plan to do with your
 life

 you know me as well as youll ever
 know anybody betty im just what i
 look and sound like my past life is a


adventure

dream good and bad ive just found why
i was ever put on earth-to love you that
is my business from here on out

  if youre bound to be practical-i told
the truth about buying that ranch i can
make as much money as your father makes
you can do anything youve been in the
habit of doing and if you say so ill even
join the church

  i dont want to be practical i want-
come back next sunday-no tomorrow i
want you to go now

  tell me first if you love me

  yes she whispered breathlessly but
im not at all sure that i should now let
me run home and cry

  but she was persuaded to weep in his
arms instead then she raised her wet
face and admitted tremulously that she was
glad and happy

  late stars were rising when they parted
lingeringly at the gate

  prowling night beasts heard blakes
clear voice ringing as he rode slowly along
the rough dirt road with his reins loose on
his horses neck nibs had eaten his fill of
hay in mark whites barn and blake was
full of the music of the spheres

  if the gang at the elkhom had heard him
sing juanita that night surely he would
have touched them all to tears

xiii

mminmk blake was at tom harris
place shortly after sunrise next
morning he roped the string-
aiafetja halted roan from the range and
rode with tom to riggin there they had
the papers fixed up

  blake cleared the mortgage held by
brown and paid in cash to harris a greater
sum than the old man had owned in many
moons

  youll find this is the wisest move you
ever made harris said quaveringly i
like to see a young feller savin his money
an investin in good sound property there
aint no reason why you cant be as rich as
is brown inside twenty years maybe richer
its the right kind of a move your coin
cant run out through holes in your pockets
now

  its the right kind of a move for you
anyhow tom blake laughed he well
understood that toms tremulous joy was
largely for his own sake now if youll take

an old mans advice youll fit up that cigar
store before the money gets away from you

  well i have made my mistakes tom
admitted i reckon it dont look exactly
right fer me to be givin too much good
advice but im goin to foller my preachin
this time fer a fact im sure goin to salt
this down

  and he did within a month blake on
his visits to riggin purchased his tobacco
at toms seegar store in a new twelve-by-
twelve rickety wooden shack tom found
ready to his hand a clientele of old-timers
who sat on boxes smoked and chewed to-
bacco talked of the glories of the good old
days and lamented the forward march of
time tom heard all the news by word of
mouth nursed his rheumatism cussed the
rapacious dentists and took it easy with a
vengeance

   blake refrained for obvious reasons to im-
part news of his happiness to hank but
hank was not long in learning of it he
had gone to work for jim taylor they
met in the road blake despite all his reso-
lution could feel the hot blood mounting to
his face as hank stared at him cynically

   nother good man dead hank said

  blake took up his ranching with the same
dynamic energy with which he followed any
line of endeavor in which his heart was en-
gaged he hired two good woodsmen and a
carpenter and bought a team and wagon
within three days the orderless jumble of
shacks and cabins at the harris place looked
to have been smitten by a cyclone they
were torn piece from piece

  he remodeled the barn and built a new
cabin in a more picturesque location-a
beautiful cabin of hewn logs plastered with-
in snugly ceiled and roofed in a setting of
bright evergreens with a green lawn shelving
down to the creek

  he continued to attend sunday school
and read lessons in immortality from a pair
of dark eyes his visits to the white home
became more and more frequent the trail
skirting the foothills from the harris ranch
to whites well worn

  the staid conventional life he proposed
to lead was a striking contrast to his past
no more gambling no more wild riding
cows as his stock in trade a few to begin
with obeying the command of nature to
bring forth young in their season slow
months spring summer autumn and
winter for growth then an increased herd
lucky moon



of females and the fattening and selling of
the steers

  he had little capital his start would be
slow but on this he did not let his mind
dwell only one phase of the life was in his
vision as hank observed blake was sure
knocked cuckoo when he could take it into
his head to be a pillar in the church in-
deed the wild blake moody was mad as a
mad march hare

  the weeks sped quickly away summer
was past and fall came in with an indian
summer haze that made dream mountains
out of distant ranges green birches wil-
lows cottonwoods and aspens along the
lower creeks frost-touched blazed in crim-
son and gold

  blake labored as never before he kept
a hired man always partly for help largely
because he could not bear the loneliness of
batching tom harris staggering fences
were pulled down strong posts were deep-
ly rigidly set and slack wires restretched
the rail fences and stockades of the corrals
were rebuilt

  blake sang as he worked some unprint-
able cowboy ballads but in the main those
songs that betty white and jane compton
played at last he surveyed his handiwork
and his critical eyes told him it was good

  it was mid-morning of a da that threat-
ened rain rank after rank of thin clouds
with silver corrugations marched across the
sky there was a strange breathless hush in
the air the seven devils were dim with
an impalpable haze and even minidoka was
indistinct blake felt strangely restless
he saddled his horse

  i want to see mcalister about them
heifers he told jack day the hired hand
you can go on with that pasture fence if
it dont rain you out ill be back early

  as he rode toward skull creek the thin
clouds became denser up over the seven
devils came a tumbling black mass huge
as a million zeppelins rolled into one
pushed by a strong wind and heavily
freighted it came staggering along its
aerial roadway

  blake raced with the storm for mcalis-
ters ranch the first huge drops were fall-
ing as he tied his horse in the stable and ran
into the house

  while he stood by the hearth safe and dry
without a foreboding of evil the black cloud
went before the wind like a rudderless
storm-driven ship and struck on the apical

cliffs of minidoka it broke and dropped
a hundred million tons of water into the shed
of clear creek	

  a black torrent a hurtling wall thunder-
ing down the gorge pushing huge boulders
and logs like marbles and straws

  mcalister was not at home and as soon
as the storm was past blake started back
the trail was spongy and slippery and pools
of water stood in all the hollows

  it was when he reached clear creek that
boding of the evil that had fallen first came
upon him the rush of the torrent had
passed sweeping away bordering trees pil-
ing great masses of wreckage along the banks
the stream was still a rumbling spate rush-
ing bank full red under the bright sun

  nibs feared to enter the water rearing
back snorting from the margin and blake
trusting his instinct implicitly did not urge
him he followed the right-hand bank to-
ward the ranch

  while still three miles below he met jack
day he was coatless hatless and drenched
as though he had been plunged into a lake

 theres sure been - a-poppin

blake day said i was cookin dinner
when the rain commenced drectly i
heered it cornin like an express train it was
roarin over a trestle i legged it fer high
land without stoppin fer hat or coat
wasnt none too soon neither an how
it did rain it come down in bucketfuls

  you aint got any ranch left blake it

sure is-after all the work we done it

took cabin barns corrals-everthing an
it piled boulders forty foot high in places an
logs all tangled up like toothpicks it makes
a man sick to see it

blake had no desire to see it
he had seen the work of cloud-
bursts he knew the devasta-
tion they wrought his ranch
had lain in the path of one nature after
building with studied care through the cen-
turies the alluvial delta at the canyon
mouth rooting it with trees carpeting it
with grass had defaced it at one stroke like
a peevish child at play blake had been
an ant unwarily trafficking on the scene of
play the inexorable storm had worked
him bane

  well jack he said glad it didnt
come in the night and catch us asleep
lucky you got out as it was lets see i
owe you for these last two weeks might


adventure

as well settle up i aint canning you un-
derstand the grin he summoned was
wan but when all the work is done
were through

  no day protested as blake proffered
the money youve lost it all i can af-
ford two weeks work when you start in
agin let me know i like to work for you
hope youre luckier next time

  blake watched him go splashing down the
trail the creek had fallen sensibly he
waited half an hour then nibs was willing
to take the ford

xiv

across the creek he thrust his
hands into his chaps pockets and
turned his horse loose nibs wise
horse took the trail he had traveled
so often of late at a swift running walk

  blakes brain felt numb the catastrophe
on him had not the saddening effect as on
one who had put many of his best years into
the accumulation of a property to have it
wiped out in a breath by fire or flood after
all blake hadnt had much in the ranch it
had cost him only a trifle when all was said
-some dollars won quickly by chance and
skill a few weeks of diverting labor he
wasnt sorrowful

  but his plans were wrecked like a coura-
geous airman who had undertaken to fly at
one swoop from side to side of a wide conti-
nent he stood afoot unhurt soon after the
beginning of his flight beside a shattered
plane the way before him was long and
tedious it was much nearer to where he
had taken off

  halfway along the trail he met hank on
a sweating cayuse riding hard toward his
place

  blake he began excitedly i want you
to help me just come down from riggin
sheriff lamb pulled out with a posse awhile
ago after a gang uh rustlers dangdest
steal you ever heard of somebodys cleaned
out israel browns perchuns-ever hoof
slick as a ribbon an maybe a few cayuses
throwed in

  nobody knows where they went israel
went west lookin for tracks fat chance
hell have pickin up a trail after this rain
i think lamb went east around the range
i dont know where the colts went but i
know how to beat lamb to hitchcocks
basin with five hours the start of me

theys two-fifty a piece for us if we git the
horses-thats a hard winters work are
you on

  might as well blake said i aint got
any ranch to bother me now that rain
rubbed it out-just like that he swept
his arm in an eloquent gesture

  oh the dickens hank said sympa-
thetically i knowed they was a cloud-
burst but somehow i never seem to think
of you as a rancher that it might hit you
never entered my bean if id thought id
uh flagged my heels up there with a shovel
an dug a canal to lead the water around
your meadow an a lake to ketch the dee-
bris so it cleaned you out

  blake grinned

  well i aint a rancher now but by
golly its kind of tough at that the way
ive been driving nails and steeples and
making the chips fly the last few weeks is a
sin look at the callouses on my hands
he held up his palms

  and the rainstorm comes along- puff
an there goes all the chips off your logs an
all youve been buyin with your poker an
blackjack chips to boot an prizes for ridin
bulldoggin an ropin throwed along with
the rest oh well come easy go easy as
the sheepherder says that worked six
months for a winters stake an blowed it in
in twenty nine minutes but whisperin
rattlesnakes here we are talkin about
busted clouds an gutted ranches with
browns colts gittin farther away ever
minute

   i got to go to taylors for  deuteron-
omy wouldnt try to chase a sheep on
this eight hundred pounds uh jelly meet
you at the mouth uh blue canyon in one
hour an a half he was gone with lash-
ing quirt

  blake thanked hank from his heart for
the promised ride it gave him an immedi-
ate purpose promised some fervent action
for a day or two from whence he hoped to
gain the inspiration that would enable him
to form some plans

betty when he arrived at
whites was in the yard wear-
ing a pair of muddy gloves trans-
ferring with a small spade sum-
mer plants from outdoor beds to pots she
met him smiling and though he strove to
appear natural her smile passed as she
looked closely at his face
lucky moon



  why blake you look as if youd lost
  our last friend

  but i havent though have i you
till love me

  did you think i didnt

  betty he said seating himself on the
cobblestone wall of a flower bed do you
know what that cloudburst has done it
has washed our ranch into snake river-
that is i suppose its to the snake by
this time if it kept up the speed it started
with

  are you joking her face was tragic
i never felt so little like cracking jokes
in my life

  oh well-she smiled bravely-what
does a ranch amount to there are lots of
others

  youre all right little girl he said with
a sudden uprush of feeling youre all
right youd put life into a wooden man
that old rainstorm cant keep us down
well do it again-and just as dog-gone
quick as before im going out right
now and grab off two-fifty toward an-
other one

  some of the color left her face she
touched her tongue to her lips

  blake she said earnestly coming close
to him i dont want you to get it quickly
i-i- blake neither mother nor father
knows where you got all that money they
take it for granted you brought it here sav-
ings-all except the prizes you won at mav-
erick which of course are all right but i
heard-naturally because everybody beside
them it seems know it

  i could forgive that it was before-
before- but i dont want you to get any
more that way id much rather youd-
well earn it i know you are good blake
i know daddy hasnt made any mistake in
his high opinion of you

  he was looking down as she was speak-
ing rolling a spur rowell abstractedly with
his boot toe

  i mean to earn it but if anybody
thinks im going to drag along for years
saving a fortune from stray nickles and
dimes-well i cant thats all i aint cut
out that way i dont know how im going
to earn our next start my head hasnt
started working since jack day told me
what the rain had done but that start
had got to come fast im not playing
cards for this two-fifty im going to help
hank fairless run down a horse thief or two

that walked off with browns horses thatll
be earning it-doing the world a good
turn

  he saw horror dawn in her face

 no no thats worse yet guns-
shooting maybe i dont want you to
blake

  always accustomed to make decisions for
himself he had not given a thought to the
possibility of opposition from her

  why he said surprized its good work
to get a horse thief-if you can and it
aint often you can

  yes but there are officers hired to get
them

  i guess thats so maybe thats the
right way to look at it ill think it over
maybe next time if they aint my horses i
can see my way clear to stay out reward or
no reward but ive got to go this time-
promised hank i would besides betty i
want to go it would do me good to get
shot at might start the wheels turning in
my head again

 you say you want to go and you
promised hank fairless her face had
grown strained and utterly white some-
times i cant understand you at all
blake you- cant you just help be-
ing wild

  looking at her near as she stood it
seemed that she had drawn far away that
a great gulf suddenly riven by an invisible
force yawned between them

  wild oh betty whats the use i
never gave a thought as to whether i was
wild or tame i never tried to make myself
over for you i was just myself you
seemed to like me that way maybe it was
because you didnt know me anyhow ive
got to get away and think that rain simply

raised - with me three hours ago i

would have told the world i was a rancher
now i aint got any more business than an
australian bushman he rose slowly to
his feet

  please dont swear like that so you
are going

  yes promised hank i would hes af-
ter his horse now

  do you realize that in going you are
making a choice between my earnest wishes
and-and doing what hank fairless wants
you to

  i dont think so it aint because ive
got no regard for your wishes but-well
if you want to put it that way let it go for


adventure

the last couple months ive been dreaming
about dragging in the world and piling it at
your feet that looks like a wild dream
now if i dont do some tall thinking and
get into action ive got nothing not a
thing for you except my hands and
heart

  he waited for her to speak but she was
silent her eyes upon the ground the same
strained expression in her face

  ive got to meet hank and be on the
way- guess our doll house is flat betty
but it was pretty before the wind blew it
down will you say good-by

  she raised her eyes with pain in them and
reproach but did not speak

  he turned on his heel went through the
gate and swung into the saddle the big
bay had started to move away

  blake the cry wrenched from her
throat literally turned him in the saddle
the ice in her face had melted she ran
toward him

  i cant bear to have you go like that
youll be careful wont you promise me
you will

  i will he said unsteadily his own stern-
ness turning to water as careful as i can
and betty- oh well talk it over when i
get back i tell you i cant think i know
youre mine thats all i know now i wish
we was living ten thousand years ago when
a fighting man didnt need a ranch and was
entitled to all he could take and hold id
just lift you up behind me on old nibs and
ride away

  d-dont worry about the ranch blake
your-your hands and h-heart are enough

gsagjggsa the two riders entered the can-
ljigjl yon and were immediately in
rfjf shadow they had daylight with
ssslil the sun behind the canyon wall
for two hours night was upon them as
they zigzagged upward from the little circu-
lar valley a half moon early-risen shed
a pale deceptive light

  they rode single file hank leading the
way their talk was little blake barely
grunting in reply to his companions occa-
sional sallies as the horses rested hank
was in a prodigious hurry pushing forward
with all possible speed-which was little-as
though life itself was the issue

question of when they started and how

good they know the country he said
them colts will do pore travelin after the
first few hours the rainll wipe out all the

tracks they made up till after the storm i
want a look at the basin before daylight to-
morrow

  they reached in their assent the broken
deer trail and hank without pausing turned
up the canyon blake stopped his panting
horse below him unseen rumbled the
rushing stream above in a rain-cleared
sky very near and bright hung the moon
night and solitude and silence except for
the diminishing hoof-beats of hanks horse
and the never-ending cadence of the stream
the confusion in blakes mind was changing
into order a thought shaped itself

  i ought to have lived ten thousand years
ago- money- money- cant get along
without it- and get it by hard work and
slow- sin to gamble- she was raised
to think different- theyre right at
that-

  he heard a call faint with distance and
rode onward he met hank coming back
the gray picking his way gingerly along the
dangerous trail loosing rocks at intervals
that leaped down the precipices starting
small avalanches that thundered to the bot-
tom of the canyon far below fairless
reined up snarling

  blake you love-sick scum uh creation
whats eatin you thought nibs rolled
into the canyon here youve lost us ten
good minutes when we aint got ten seconds
to spare you- he became inartic-
ulate with wrath

  on and on they went the labor of the
journey increased tenfold by the darkness
the moon rode swiftly across the narrow
slit of the sky and then they had only pale
stars where they doubted the evidence of
their own eyes they trusted to the instinct
of their horses

  the sure-footed powerful beasts carried
them through the first light of day was
clearing the eastern sky as they scrambled
panting up the last almost vertical rise at
the entrance of the basin

  the light grew rapidly as they rode to-
ward the open above them towered the
craggy peaks giant pinnacles now white
majestically beautiful with the first snow
but cold cold the whole great scene was
silent as a primordial world sunlight
blazed in splendor on the white heads the
basin was still in shadow
lucky moon



  they rode carefully speaking in whispers
until through a rift in the firs the meadow
opened before them they saw a straggling
herd of loose horses

  theres the caballos blake said won-
der where the men are we aint got any
time to spare

  no weve already spared too much
theyve probly lamped us before now

  as he spoke there came the echoing crash
of a gun then another and another repeat-
ing rifles fired rapidly the shots were not
from near at hand but in the great ampi-
theater the echos beat back and forth and
the silence was shattered into a tumult of
sound

  as they looked at each other startled
there came the rumble of galloping horses
they saw the loose herd breaking away in
a panic guns in hand they headed swiftly
toward the edge of the timber on reach-
ing the open one swift look revealed the
situation

  three horsemen were speeding toward
the rim of the basin where the canyon
opened at the north to the south far
distant four others stood on a low rise dim
smoke rose over them as the guns barked
above the thunder of running horses they
heard the bullets relentless messengers of
death go whining across the valley

  theres jeff jamison or im a horned
toad yelled hank setting spurs to his gray
wish to- had a rifle

  just then they saw the rearmost of the
fleeing horses go down in a terrible fall life
smitten from him while in full career the
animal was transformed into an inert mass
of flesh bearing all the momentum of flight
it crumpled touched nose and rolled the
rider was hurled heels over head the other
two without pausing swept on and were soon
out of sight

  as blake and hank galloped in pursuit
the fallen man rose slowly dazedly to his feet
and like one in a dream searched for and
found his hat it was rob white

  hank went by him without slackening
pace bent on preventing the escape of the
others he held his revolver in readiness
and rode with all his skill urging the gray to
the top of its speed

  the sheriffs party had ceased firing and
on tired horses were galloping into the basin

  abreast of rob blake reined up and
nibs inimitable cow horse broke his head-
long career in two short leaps

get on blake commanded free-
ing a stirrup rob sprang up be-
hind him the big horse running
powerfully under his double bur-
den rushed straight at the basin rim

  then the guns behind them opened up
again a bullet shrieked past so near that
they could feel its breath white shrank
instinctively far to one side

  sit still blake roared youll have
this horse down

  aint that lamb the-shot robs

affectation of nonchalance was gone utterly
he was almost weeping hes a half mile
away if hes an inch when he unlimbers
that old - he can shoot at you today and
kill you tomorrow

  during a few seconds while bullets droned
around them like hornets they were in view
of the posse then nibs with the long leaps
of a cougar was plunging down a sharp in-
cline into a timbered canyon mouth

  a half dozen loose horses were running
wildly before them and nibs was overhaul-
ing them

  any of them broke blake demanded

  that old p-p-pinto of browns is rob
chattered

  eight seconds later blake had a loop over
her shaggy head and had brought her up
strangling he leaped to the ground at-
tacking like a beast of prey while wise old
nibs kept tight the choking noose he
seized her ears and twisting them cruelly
threw all his weight upon her head

  bring my saddle

  he seized the tip of an ear in his teeth and
bore her head almost to the ground hold-
ing her helpless rob ran with the saddle
and cinched it upon her back they
worked like relay riders racing against
time in the beginning of a minute the
mare was running free before the end of
the sixty second interval she was saddled
with a swimming halter made from blakes
riata on her head and blake was in the
saddle

  she bucked five jumps then raised her
head and ran rob followed on nibs bare-
back

  they overtook hank a few moments later
where the canyon broke into two prongs
he was wildly angry

  watchu think youre pullin off he
roared if were goin to stop em weve
got to show speed an system wish lambd
git here


adventure

  i dont said rob im going

  not on my horse blake said

  oh- hank exploded fine help

you are les git action i think they
went down this right hand prong

  they galloped for half a mile and came to
where the flinty canyon bed held not a trace
of any fugitive hank circled like an eager
hound

lets go rob said desperately i
dont want to see lamb-not ever again
what are we goin to do with rob any-
how hank asked as though he had just
noted the boys presence

  we dont want him do we

  no but after what i seen up there in
the basin i sure want to git the deadwood
on a pair uh jamisons that was jeff an
pete wasnt it he demanded of rob

  yes and jeff saw my horse go down
i saw him turn his head when the bullet
smashed they run off and left me

  sure they would save their own hides
-to thunder with yourn

  lets go rob said looking fearfully
up the canyon

  yes lets go blake agreed were
killing time he started at a quick trot

  whats the big idea hank protested
i want a pair uh jamisons an i want em
bad

  might as well look for a pair of needles
in a stack of hay theyve got the world
to hide in and fresh horses to ride you
dont want to take rob back to lamb do
you

  no but whats that got to do with
slammin the hooks into jeff jamison
quite a bit to do with it the posse
seen me ride off with the man theyd downed
and emptied a dozen cannons at me they
could tell my horse as far as they could see
him i figure we might have a hard time
explaining things we aint got a chance
in a million of getting a jamison

  dont try to kid me hank said we
can prove our reasons for bein here easy
he was following blake reluctantly young
white was leading out rapidly

  maybe we could--if we turned rob in
but he aint going to show up in this mess
i didnt have an idea in the world of finding

him in this kind of a layout looks-

bad but this will cure him hell be a
good dog from here on out

  hank whistled softly they had alto-
gether lost the trail of the other rustlers who

on fresh horses were doubtless making far
better time than they could hope to achieve
they left the canyon climbed a steep tribu-
tary gulch and entered a secluded hollow
their horses were very tired

  we can let the horses eat here blake
said and watch for lamb from that ridge
up there

  this is sure a nice mess hank said
bitterly he had come to a full realization
of the radical change in their status weve
turned this into a fine layout see what i
told you them little times lost stallin in
the canyon last night done for us three
minutes earlier an id uh been in range uh
that sneakin jeff jamison  deuter-
onomy had one good half mile left in him
that lanky string uh jerked sheep carion
aint got judgment enough to steal a horse
that can make deuteronomy eat dust for
half a mile

  i dont git you a-tall he had grown
more calm whatre you figgerin on
doin just let lamb think you was in with
em an let it go at that lambll figger hes
got enough evidence to send us to the pen
actin this way  i aint with you there i
might steal the pennies out of a blind beg-
gars hat an grab candy away from a kid
but i aint no-horse thief

  ill just let him figger awhile blake
said its this way- rob is caught red-
handed he deserves the pen aint that
right rob

  rob was silent he lowered his eyes in
shame and dug in the ground with his toe

  but blake went on i believe a judge
would hand him the lightest possible sen-
tence-thatd be two years hed throw
the book at the jamisons if he had em but
hed be lenient as he could with rob con-
siderin his family an the fact he aint done
anything very bad before but two years
in the pen makes a man an ex-convict for
life looks to me like rob has had his les-
son im willing since its sort of up to us
to be more lenient than the judge

  how about it rob think you can
show some respect for yourself-and your
folks-and go straight

  god knows i can the boy said fervent-
ly if i get out of this never again i-i
dont know why i went in by gosh i dont
know i owed jeff a little money i al-
ways had a deuce of a time savin up enough
to pay him he had treated me pretty
good once in grangeville he paid a fine
lucky moon



for me and got me out of the coop i payed
that back i offered to work for him and
he sprung this deal on me it looked awful
easy-just shove the colts to the montana
line i never did like old is brown but i
aint got any excuse i must have been
stark ravin crazy and think of them
jamisons running off and leavin me

  thats what you get when you pick jeff
jamisons for friends hank observed

  all right kid you can have another
chance blake spoke like a benevolent
czar i believe youre worth it if youve
got any of you fathers blood in you at all
i know you are you can make a sur-
cingle out of a piece of my rope and ride the
pinto back to her range when you get
close to home turn her loose and walk in
keep out of sight till you get there then
therell be no evidence unless you squawk
brown can round up his horses the jami-
sons have probably skipped clean out of the
country nobodys hurt-much

fwfefj conversation lagged as the
jpii three lay cold and hungry behind
jsfeasjg- a clump of brush on a ridge from
v whence they could keep an eye on
all the approaches while the horses fed in the
hollow

  as the day advanced the sky grew lower-
ing and overcast after the first magnifi-
cent play of light on the snow peaks they
had hardly seen the sun a wind sad-
voiced desolate hinting of frost and ice and
bleak winter soughed through the trees
the clouds thickened imperceptibly and
snow began to fall toes and fingers ached
and grew numb where they lay

  hank rose to his feet swearing violently

  im the coldest horse thief that ever laid
out behind a bush tryin to see a cold-
blooded sheriff a mile away through a snow-
storm so thick i couldnt see a warm four-
story saloon fifty yards les git under a
tree let lamb sneak up on me if he wants
his left eye blacked good an plenty

  they found a fir with dense branches
sloping from trunk earthward in this
primitive shelter they brushed the snow
from their clothing and stamped and swung
their arms

f blake if i was you said hank through
chattering teeth id fergit about the new
moon over my right shoulder spellin good

luck judgin from your dee-falcations
sence we hit this neck uh the woods id say
youre about the unluckiest hombre that ever
came down the pike you got kicked an
jailed you got into a couple lucky games
an won a saddle an some jack at the show
then along comes the water-spout-an
all youve got left of the whole kiboodle is
the saddle an to top it all off beautiful
you go to sleep in blue canyon an we miss
gittin in range uh two uh my worst horse
thief friends by six inches

  ive seen hombres that didnt know they
is any moon win big at cards i beleve you
could still ride an throw a rope if somebody
was to hang a curtain over the moon dont
talk to me about luck no more

  the trouble with you hank is youre
too much like a lot of others-youve got
a poland chinas idea of luck getting
hold of something good like money and
hanging onto it like a leech to a drownded
nigger-that aint luck

  ive had all the luck in the world since
we hit this section i had the fun of draw-
ing full houses in poker and naturals in
blackjack and walking out loaded down
with dinero i had the crowd at maverick
howling my name for three days till they
was hoarse and even when the mare
stepped on me instead of packing me some
place else you took me where there was a
piano and-and a family of fine folks i
had a barrel of fun spending that money
besides helping poor old tom harris out

  luck what do you call luck when
you go to a show all you expect is a good
time aint it you dont figger on walking
off with the gate receipts

  hank shook his head hopelessly set his
knocking teeth and swung his arms harder

  but it takes real two-oclock-in-the-
morning kind of guts for a man to believe
theres anything worth going after in life
when hes as cold as i am ill admit that
blake added

  you said it hank agreed savagely
les git out uh these mountains before
were snowed in whatd i care if we meet
the whole state militia

  they saddled the horses blake smoothing
with inordinate care the navaho blanket on
nibs back rob chastened shamed and
miserable cut blakes riata and cinched a
surcingle on the pinto to cling to in case she
bucked

  turn her loose when you get close to
o

adventure

home and walk in blake repeated to rob
and the next time you drive any horses be
sure theyre your own or youve got the
owners permission now adios and good
luck

  aint you-aint you going too

  if i do ive got a hunch lamb will come
looking for me and ill have to kick in with
all i know to save my own hide so im
going to argentina starting right now
pronto

  robs face was aghast

  you-you neednt think im that cali-
ber blake to let you ride out of the country
packing the blame that belongs to me-not

after youve tried to skelp im no --

jamison you go on back ill take my
medicine

  thats white mans talk blake com-
mended but youre not the only one to
think of you couldnt swallow all the
medicine if you tried your folks would
get the biggest share no the way ive
said is best if hank wants to go back
maybe he can prove an alibi without drag-
ging anybody else in

  hank had brightened wonderfully

  i guess not go back  argentine
looks good to me too i think maybe jeff
jamisons run that way if i can ever git
one good whack at that disgrace uh human-
ity without nobody havin a death grip
on my shirt collar hell think a band
uh stampedin long horns is walkin on
his face

  i didnt know what blake had in that
keen brain uh hisn or i wouldnt uh done all
this worryin his ol head is workin true
to form thats a sagebrush cinch if he was
to stay around here another two months
blaked be married sure as squawfish cant
walk sewed up dead to rights

  married cried rob indignantly aint
that all right im tellin you hank fair-
less youd better not be saying my sis-
ter-

  cut it out you two blake growled
  rob drew blake aside

  this is plain- he said miserably

whatll i tell betty

  maybe youre taking too much for
granted in thinking she aint got wiser ideas
about this than you

  i know her better than you do shes
serious about things shell never forgive
me

  its a good thing i have to go blake

  said i know that thought about it all
the way up blue canyon if i could with-
out raising seven degrees of old nick of
course id go back it may look funny for
me to run away but not near as funny as
you would look in steel bracelets

  but dont feel sore at yourself about
that hank said once im not in her class
he may be right anyhow i doubt if im
the stuff good husbands are made of-too
curious about what the world looks like
from the top of the next ridge but the
worst is where yesterday i had a neat little
stake from gambling today im broke she
wouldnt let me gamble any more and ten
to one id never make anything at it
if i did i never was very lucky at poker
before

   i wont have her face the years of pov-
erty ive seen too many fellows try to
head a family when they couldnt make a
living for themselves ive seen too much
of it shes a mighty fine girl and shes
worth ten times more than i can give i
can do her more good by going than stay-
ing in more ways than one

  now be good to yourself rob if i
ever hit this country again im expecting
to find you a decent citizen

   blake and hank rode eastward

   bur-r-r-r blake shivered i aint got
on half enough clothes if a man gets
snowed on once thats probably the fault
of the weather if he gets snowed on twice
hes got no one to blame but himself
hank im headed for the yucca country
as fast as old nibs can travel

  they had ridden in silence for miles
hank suddenly reined up his horse

   ive got it he exclaimed jubilantly
ive think it out you was right thats a
sagebrush cinch lucky moons-ill tell
the cock-eyed world this last one was
robs an bettys you pulled rob back
on his feet just as he was hittin the skids
thats lucky for him not to mention his
folks now youre headin for south ameri-
ca thats lucky for betty white whether
she believes it or not also lucky for you-
saves you from a life-term uh matrimony at
hard labor

  youre right theys luck in the moon
if you git on the right side of it an not
only for you but for everbody around
you im with you now cowboy so keep
right on a-lookin for it down the ol right
shoulder

author of the proving of old man lindquist  stowed away etc

 hot decades in a ships engine
room had inured chief angus
macdermut to ordinary heat
but the vertical sun of a meso-
potamian august had driven him away
from his harbor tuning-up of the sedalias
engines and sent him panting to the scanty
shade the bridge cast on the forward well-
deck he sat on a camp stool in his dun-
garees and undershirt perspiration standing
in globules on his bald head and running
down the hollow of his chest and cursed the
sun that sent the dancing heat waves rising
as though the sedalias deck was the lid of
tophet cursed mesopotamia the shat-el-
arab rivef where the ship lay and the port
of basra ten miles up-stream whence even-
tually a cargo would come

  it was a thorough and workmanlike piece
of profanity it made the engineer feel
better with the result that when the skip-
per popped over the rail his homely face
glowing with enthusiasm and slapped mac-
dermut heartily on the back the scot only
grinned

  aweel captain prescott im thinkin
yeve got a cargo macdermut chuckled

  with arms akimbo long andy prescott
grinned down at the little engineer then
of a sudden every sign of humor was erased
from his face save the twinkle in his light
gray eyes

  mac the great american public is
clamoring for dates he declared solemnly

  aye na dout macdermut grunted
visibly unimpressed though i didna

hear them when we left new york an
gin theyre clamoring why should that set
ye dancin like a monkey on a stick in this
ash-pit o a country

  mac you dont understand me the
american public is clamoring for dates
prescott insisted and they aint got
any the dates theyre clamoring for-
four thousand tons of them-are here at
basra

  an the sedalia carries them home
yere inf errin weve a cargo is that all
your excuse for tryin to knock a mon off his
chair

  prescott shook his head his eyes were
still dancing but his tone was deadly
serious

  no mac the american public really
must be clamoring he explained be-
cause-being a scotchman you better take
a good grip on that chair-because on the
understanding that we make an extra quick
passage the shipping agent has offered us a
bonus of five pounds sterling per ton five
pounds is twenty-five dollars and there are
four thousand tons mac one hundred
thousand-and the freight

  losh murmured the engineer

  he pulled out a blue bandanna and slowly
wiped his bald head while a smile mirrored
his delight at this colossal windfall then
by degrees his expression became gloomy
even in the first flush of enthusiasm mac-
dermut realized that it would be he the
chief engineer and not the skipper who
would have to earn that bonus


five pounds per ton bonus



  an how fast a passage did ye promise
captain prescott he asked quietly

  we must dock in new york october
fifteenth mac i figured out the run in
the agents office it means we must
average twelve and one-half knots all the
way youve turned the sedalia up as fast
as that

 losh repeated macdermut very
thoughtfully as ye say weve logged as
much as that-for a half-day an then a
week to rest the firemen and ease the en-
gines but this run is a quarter way round
the world captain ye know our standard
speed is eleven knots fifty-six revolu-
tions per minute an yere askin for twelve
and a half and sixty-five

  macdermut shook his head frowning

  still five pounds per ton he went on
and drummed on his knee with his fingers
yell get the owners to give me a two
weeks overhaul in new york yer engines
are liable to be scrap he asked plaintively

  you can do it mac the captain en-
couraged

  do it of course we can do it growled
macdermut drive drive drive for
weeks on end swill the bearins wi oil and
trust shell stand it steam an steel will
stand lots o abuse its the men im
worryin for its like asking yer watch
offices to steam six thousand miles in noth-
ing but thick fog captain thats what
forced draught means to the black gang
an summer too shell be a hot ship
below grimly prophesied macdermut

slingloads of dates in square
wooden cases about eighteen
inches by twelve began to swing
over the sedalias rail that after-
noon and andy prescott and his mates
drove the stevedores with oaths and back-
sheesh at a pace that left macdermut with
all too little time for preparation the en-
gines were as ready as skill and painstaking
care could make them but two days earlier
a hook on a chain hoist had slipped and a
falling cylinder head had sent the third
engineer and the oiler helping him on the
job into the hospital

  in addition more firemen had to be
signed on and good sailors on the beach
are scarce at basra macdermut combed
every consuls office and cafe in the sun-
baked town he returned aboard with a
sour face for oiler and firemen he could

obtain nothing but arabs the only en-
gineer had produced a french ticket though
he gave his name as bourchard

  his squat broad-shouldered figure and
the black beard which clung to his face in a
tightly curled mat like astrachan lambs
wool convinced macdermut of his nation-
ality though it made him suspect the worst
of bourchards professional skill

  prescott had warned his engineer not to
pick a foreigner and even protested stren-
uously before he consented to sign the man
on but as macdermut pointed out it was
a case of bourchard or no one time
pressed for prescott had decided to put
to sea only partially loaded

  there are only nineteen feet of water over
the bar which lies well off the mouth of the
combined tigris and euphrates rivers and
as soon as the sedalia was loaded to that
draft prescott clapped on the hatches and
put to sea he might have gotten five hun-
dred additional tons of dates if he had dared
to anchor off the bar until they  could be
lightered out but as he explained to
macdermut there was too much at stake
even more than a hundred-thousand-dollar
bonus in the last days ashore gossip had
been busy with his ship and cargo on the
efficiency of macdermuts engines rested
the reputation of american shipping in that
quarter of the world

  ever since the war the dates had gone out
in german bottoms even now a new
oil-burning bremen-built freighter rated in
lloyds as making thirteen knots lay an-
chored in the stream empty for the cargo
for which she had called was under the
sedalias hatches the american concern
to which the dates were consigned had sud-
denly decided to support its own national
merchant marine but if the sedalia were
late and the american public began to
clamor for dates too loudly no one could
hope that next year patriotism would stand
again in the way of business

  all this prescott confided to macdermut
while the sedalia was pointing her nose
down-stream

  i nearly had to take a swing at that
dutchman too he reflected sore
mac he was fit to be tied i know if id a
understood german id a had to hang one
on his ear what he said in english was
bad enough why he called the sedalia a
lump of rust and coal dust that would fall
apart before we got to suez my ship


adventure

mac he said hed follow and trans-ship
the cargo when our propellers dropped off--
you can see how mad he was

   of course the losers got a right to rave
prescott continued slowly for two days
he stalked around town sour and gloomy as
a sailor ashore when all the bars are closed
i dont mind that rather enjoyed it but
on the third day he seemed to get over the
shock a bit when i met him he just
grinned at me in a nasty way and laughed
sarcastic as if the joke was on me you
know macdermut its fair wonderful how
offensive a fat red-headed dutchman gets
when he puts his mind on it

  the whole black gang was ashore the
second night macdermut ruminated
that heinie might have been thinking
how hed bribed one of them to throw
emery into the main bearings

  ill bash in the mans head that tries it
prescott promised his lean jaw setting
ominously

  for a moment he turned the thought over
in his mind far dirtier tricks have been
done before in the shipping game with a big
charter at stake at length prescotts
yankee features cleared he even grinned

  well happy days macdermut any
dirty work will be in the black gang any-
how so its up to you hop to it chief

  through torrid days when men fainted in
the engine room from the sheer breathless
heat days when the stokehold watches
were shortened and the firemen drank two
quarts of oatmeal water in every watch
through the red sea suez alexandria and
into the mediterranean where it was a little
cooler macdermut hopped to it day and
night he was in and out of the engine room
he blarneyed and cursed till his voice was so
hoarse he could scarcely speak above a
whisper hour after hour he prowled over
his engines with a flash-light calling for the
oiler here making an adjustment there
getting spare parts ready for the minor ac-
cidents and breakdown which are almost
inevitable when machinery is overdriven
with him worked shane poulson and bour-
chard the engineers and the reward of their
labor showed in the trickle of steam which
kept the sedalias safety valve popping
and a log which averaged  knots day
after day

  prescott rubbed his hands claimed theyd
sight liberty by october twelfth at this
rate and greeted macdermut with a hearty

good work mac every morning to
this the little scott would respond with a
brief nod of his bald head even on deck
his ear was cocked to catch the beat of his
engines so far he had done well yet
ahead of the sedalia was still five thousand
miles of blue water and her engines were
twenty-odd years old

  the first trouble came about five oclock
in the morning in dennis shanes watch
the freckled red-headed first engineer who
had been with the sedalia nearly as long as
macdermut reported anxiously that all
through the engines the bearings were warm
shanes first thought was to curse selim his
arab assistant for using too little oil or for
omitting his half-hourly round but the
arab his liquid brown eyes big and glassy
shook his head and stubbornly offered his
half-empty oil can as proof of assiduousness
-proof which shane naturally brushed
aside any one can waste oil

  nevertheless for most of his watch he
was forced to slow down and the three
hours at reduced speed lowered the sedalias
average to  knots for the twenty-four
hours in itself the few miles lost were
nothing the ship was slightly ahead of
schedule but shane was irritable and
macdermut worried

  ordinarily bearings get hot one at a time
hot enough to burn the engineers fingers
one bearing will frequently start to melt
out its babbitt while every other remains
cool but in this case all the bearings were
warm still ten revolutions above stand-
ard speed kept up day after day might be
expected to have that effect eventually and
so macdermut decided that the untrained
selim had gotten careless enough to slop the
oil on the engine frames instead of shooting
it properly into the bearing once the
bearings were flushed the trouble disap-
peared which bore out this theory

speed was maintained in
shanes watch that afternoon
but the following morning at
five am the bearings got warm
again the sedalia slowed down the
next afternoon for the third time in shanes
watch it was necessary to cool bearings
mac himself stood the engineers watch
that night while shane went the rounds
with the oiler everything was running
perfectly at four when bourchard went off
watch
five pounds per ton bonus



  shane saw the cups filled with oil peered
listened and tested bearings with the back
of his hand where the skin is thinner and
more sensitive to heat at five oclock
with a wild irish yell he hurled his oil-
sodden cap madly down onto the deck be-
low at macdermuts feet

  the bearins are hot again he shouted
theyre hot he repeated in a falsetto
stamping on the grating far too angry to
swear

  macdermut rubbed his chin with a
clenched right fist and raised cold gray
eyes

  then its no an accident shane dirty
moneys been paid and is bein earned

  ye aint accusin me

  shanes voice cracked he was so pale
his freckles stood out like paint blotches
on his checks his lips began to lift away
from his teeth as he gathered himself to
jump down on the little scotchman

  na na macdermut denied testily
i eentimated no such thing let me see
your oil can oiler he snapped

  wondering the arab produced the little
can with the spout and the big gallon con-
tainer which was filled with oil from the
tank at the start of each watch macder-
mut moved over to the bench and took out a
square of fine cloth placing it over the top
of a clean bucket into this filter he poured
the oil from the cans examined their in-
teriors minutely and settled down to wait
shane was plainly puzzled by this action
and macdermut explained

  yell hear strange tales whiles yere
sipping a dram o liquor shane ive
studied more to run yon machines than
wreck them but there was a young lad at
antofagasta-fourth engineer on a liner
kicked off his ship he was for cause ive na
dout he was bragging in the bar how hed
got square with the chief a handful of
ashes flung in the oil he said and the bear-
ingsll get hot im wondering emery or
sand would have melted the friction metal
ye ken and somethings bein done every
day at the same time

  as he finished macdermut lifted up the
square of cloth holding it against the fight
shane peered closely over his shoulder then
each turned to the other and saw his disap-
pointment reflected in the face opposite

  except for a yellow oil stain the cloth
was perfectly clean

  your hunch was wrong chief said

shane so low that his sympathy was barely
audible above the noise of the engines

  i wonder said macdermut

  he thrust his hands in the pockets of his
dungarees and teetered back and forth on
his heels for ten revolutions of the screw
then without a word he walked from the
engine room and stayed in his room for ten
hours if it was going to be necessary to
lift the bearings twice a day for the re-
mainder of the voyage the sedalia would
be paid no bonus

  macdermut was desperate and it must
have been an unconscious grimness in his
attitude when he reentered the engine room
in the middle of bourchards watch which
made the frenchman hurry forward ner-
vously wiping his hands with a wad of waste
the beat of the engines informed macder-
muts trained ears that everything was go-
ing well and he simply shrugged his shoul-
ders at bourchards voluble assurances
let msieur macdermu look at his log let
him-

  ive blamed ye for naething mr bour-
chard macdermut cut into the flow of
talk irritably

  yus nothing happens in our watch
boasted the oiler

  there was a nasty implication in the
mans tone that angered macdermut thor-
oughly for he had never liked greathitt
there is seldom love lost between a reserved
glasgow engineer and an impudent cockney
oiler and greathitts sallow face was al-
ways either smirking or fawning both of
which macdermut detested he had often
wished greathitt would leave the ship but
it was against the engineers principles to
haze any one tired as he had become of
seeing greathitts sleek black head and big
ears moving around the engine room for the
past two years

  bring me yer oil can macdermut
growled mostly to punish the oiler for his
impudence

  greathitt blinked with surprize but he
brought the big can without noticeable
hesitation macdermut glanced into it
idly was handing back the can when on
the surface where the oil touched the metal
he saw a fleck of scum

  theres ashes in it you thief he
shouted

  dont hit me sir greathitt cringed
back against the bulkhead i dont know
nothing about no ashes shelp me i never


adventure

put them there he shrilled frightened and
vicious as a rat in a corner

  bourchard macdermut snapped

  i know nozzing the bearded man de-
nied his big head wagging slowly

  his wandering eye fell on greathitt
who had moved forward to face mac-
dermut as soon as the risk of a blow had
passed

  cochon pig the frenchman snarled

   barely in time to stop his leap at the oil-
ers throat macdermut rammed his hand
against bourchards chest

  not sae hasty macdermut counter-
manded  tis easy to prove yer inno-
cence by knocking a mon down bourchard
im na sae confident it wasna yersel ye
know tis in cold blood well find out
why mon shane wud kill ye

  the answer was the red sheen that glared
in bourchards eyes the bristling of his
beard both men were short they stood
breast to breast and eye to eye neither
quailing an inch to greathitts whines
and recriminations they were deaf mac-
dermuts face had gone white bourchards
beard writhed as he chewed at his lips
now without turning his head he spat
aside on the deck

  that is in your face he whispered be-
tween his teeth

  in macdermuts neck the muscles jerked
into relief and relaxed

  id like to kill ye he panted but
twud delay the ship go to yer cabin
yere relieved o duty

  bourchard shrugged and turned his back
deliberately while macdermut his chest
heaving as he panted for breath in the
heavy engine room air slumped on to a
stool

  mr macdermut he- greathitt yam-
mered

  you too git forward the engineer
snarled so fiercely that the oiler jumped
dodged behind the machinery and ten sec-
onds later had snatched up a jumper he had
dropped near the throttle and disappeared
up the ladder on the run

  bourchard watched him go with a sneer
then followed slowly at the foot of the
ladder he paused and turned toward
macdermut

  j have worked hard for you he said

  it was a reproach and an apology
despite the defiant pride which still rang
in his voice he waited for a reply but

macdermut did not move or speak his
feet slow and heavy on the iron ladder
bourchard climbed upward out of sight

it was perhaps ten minutes
later that shane ran into the
engine room

  bourchard called me and said
you wanted me to go on duty its only
two oclock whats the matter with him
whats wrong he cried

  macdermut was still sitting bowed on the
camp stool his head in his hands he
straightened his back wearily lifting a face
haggard with worry and fatigue and ex-
plained in a dozen blunt sentences while
shane paced up and down before him grind-
ing his heel savagely into the steel deck at
every stride

  the swine he growled as macdermut
finished and rose to go

  aye but its well to ken it must be two
o them macdermut answered

  two one ye mean

  aye one but which ill be back
shane im tired seein red tires ye

  which thats no riddle shane called
after the retreating engineer

  for some time the red-headed first officer
was far too angry to take up the routine
duties of his watch he looked angrily at
the steam gage rather in the hope that
steam would be low for his mood craved
the relief of storming into the fire room and
hazing the stokers to their task but the
pressure was high and while the arab oiler
went sulkily about his half-hourly rounds
keenly resentful because he had been driven
to work hours too soon shane continued his
pacing up and down up and down his mind
busy with the schemes of violent punish-
ment he itched to inflict on bourchard-if
macdermuts plaguey sense of justice didnt
interfere

  six bells had just been struck when shane
halted ejaculating a barking ironical
ha as a final expression of contempt at
the whole mess next he began to stretch
but while his lean arms were extended far
above his head he became conscious of the
beat and clack of the engines for the first
time since he came on watch his arms
dropped he leaned forward eyes half
shut his head on one side listening intently
again he glanced at the steam gage it
was still high and his frown deepened
with the memory of the last engine trouble
five pounds per ton bonus



in mind he laid a hand on the nearest bear-
ing it was perfectly cool-and yet the
sedalia had slowed down with steam
enough to drive her at seventy revolutions
with the throttle wide open and the engine
functioning perfectly she was making less
than twelve knots again shane listened
counting the revolutions the cadence was
just over a second as near as he could
judge fifty-five odd turns to the minute

  shanes indrawn breath hissed between
his teeth as his figure stiffened with a de-
cision suddenly made knowing that his
efforts would be fruitless he swiftly tested
the oil inspected the steam lines and veri-
fied the steam pressure by a hurried trip to
the fire room there was nothing wrong
once more the ships speed was being
checked by sly deliberate sabotage and
shane was of no mind to waste time in a
laborious effort to discover the cause by the
exercise of professional skill there was
another remedy speedier more direct and
more permanent

  thoughtfully his eye roved over the en-
gines and came to rest on the high-pressure
cylinder and the thick steam pipe that
curved from it toward the boilers through
which the hot steam was led to the engines
from the tool-rack he picked up an eight-
inch spanner and stuck it into his hip
pocket then picked up a bar and walked
swiftly up to the steam pipe where he laid
the tool carefully on the grating with a
jerk of his head he summoned the arab
oiler selim

  i go out you watch he ordered

  on second thought he picked a double
handful of waste out of the can and twisted
a sweat rag around it to make a triangular
bandage with a roll of wadding in its center
about as thick as his wrist after leaving
the engine room he walked quietly to his
own quarters where he fumbled in the
drawer under his berth till he found a rusty
pair of handcuffs he tested the locks with
a grin then tiptoed into the corridor

  the night was hot all the sleeping men
had hooked back their doors so that shane
had only to push aside the green curtain
that hung across the door opposite his one
stride brought him to the bunk holding the
handcuffs ready in his right hand he threw
aside the sheet that covered the sleeper with
his left and leaped upon the man pinioning
his arms beneath his knees there came
the thump of struggling bodies against the

partition a click as the handcuffs snapped
fast a french oath that was smothered half-
spoken shane knotted the gag at the back
of bourchards neck with a violent jerk and
touched his back lightly with the spanner

  git up before i blow you in two the
captor whispered we want you in the
engine room make a sound and ill
knock you on the head and heave you over
the side

  barefooted clad in only a pair of light
cotton drawers bourchard walked below
his hands chained behind him when he
had reached the space of open deck in
front of the throttle he paused but shane
kicked at his bare heels and pushed him up
the engine staging to the high-pressure
cylinder selim had come running up
chattering questions in pidgin english but
one look at shanes face silenced him the
arabs eyes narrowed and flashed and a
thin cruel smile shaped his lips

 hold him snapped shane selim
caught the frenchman by the elbow eagerly

  you cant speak but you cn listen you
double-crossing hound shane began he
was quivering from head to foot in a cold
rage that made it difficult for him to speak
clearly he licked his lips and went on
the engines have slowed down you can
hear em i dunno why i dunno for how
long ever since you left likely but
im goin to know an youre goin to tell
me what youve done see when you get
ready nod an ill loosen the gag

bourchards black eyes
flickered as he glanced at selim
at the door and back to shane
no mercy in either face no likeli-
hood of any one coming below at half past
three in the morning he gathered himself
together for a bull-like rush in the hope of
knocking shane off the staging but selim
threw a choking forearm across his throat
and shane pulled the spanner out of his
pocket

  i wont hit you over the head ill
slam you in the face he threatened im
just as dirty as you are you bribe-tak-
ing - come through

  bourchard shook his head the denial
was abrupt decisive

  in reply shane picked up the pinch bar
and with three swift strokes stripped the
asbestos lagging -from the steam intake un-
covering the iron pipe for a distance of about


adventure

eighteen inches glancing at bourchard
he ostentatiously spat on the bare iron
there was a hiss a puff of steam and the
moisture had vanished

  i aint bluffin you bourchard you
can talk now or ill push you on to that
and hold you there what did you do to
the engines

  bourchard nodded to signify his willing-
ness to talk

  i do nozzing wat- he spluttered
the instant the gag was loosened but before
he could say more shane pulled the knots
tight and shoved the squat frenchman back-
ward bourchard hurled himself forward at
the same instant but selim tripped him and
as he staggered shane and the arab threw
him on to the steam pipe his tortured leap
sent all three men against the low iron rail
where they struggled a second with the
smell of scorched flesh in their nostrils

  bourchard was helpless with his arms
bound and recognizing the fact he sud-
denly relaxed shane stepped back pant-
ing and a little sick the smell in the air
was horrible to him

  what did ye do to the engines he
gasped out

  bracing himself for the next assault
bourchard shook his head in denial and
rage selims arm tightened about his
throat shane set his teeth grimly as he
prepared to hurl the other back and hold
him this time but before he could do so
bourchard gave a muffled sob his chin
strained into the air and his eyes fastened
on the engine room door shane looked up
and saw macdermut standing with mouth
agape peering downward

  as shane looked up the engineer suddenly
realized the significance of those locked
struggling figures he had caught a glimpse
of bourchards handcuffs and without
pausing to shout macdermut jumped from
the doorway ten feet down the narrow steel
ladder and thrust the figures apart

  you-you- he shouted into shanes
face too excited to think of a word

  git out of here mac ill find out how
hes wrecking our engines if youll let me
alone shane pleaded hear them hes
cut em down to fifty-five turns 

  aye an if he has do ye think id use
yon macdermut blurted with a gesture
at the smoking steam pipe dye think
to get fact with a man gagged ill hae no
torture shane take it aff him

  before the other could move macdermut
whipped out a knife and cut loose the gag
himself

  weel speak for yersel bourchard he
ordered imperiously

  bourchard freed his mouth of wisps of
waste glaring malevolently at shane

  i have nozzing to say-nozzing he
rasped i have worked my best always
and he jump me when i sleep and put on
handcuffs you have seen me mister
macdermut am i a man despicable
who would stab in the back

  ye havent acted like it macdermut
grunted shane youve done everything
for us ye can and im going to log ye the
limit for it gie me that handcuff key
now get out-get to yer room while i talk
to bourchard and you ye arab scut oil
those engines

  awell the engines are running slow
bourchard macdermut went on when the
two men stood alone ye can fight shane
later hes young ye ken and hes had
provocation yell admit-though im apolo-
gizing for what he did but as ye eenti-
mate yerre a bit too much of a man to
double-cross yer own mates an i been
thinking greathitts a sneak but its one
of the two of ye steams high engines
running sweet whats wrang then

  if i should tell you you would say i was
scared of a burn bourchard growled

  not wi one markin yer legs an am
i a man or a child macdermut urged
speak out mon

  when you come into a dock-in a fog
when the bridge rings for reduced speed
what you do bourchard asked slowly

  gie her less throttle replied macder-
mut impatiently

  and if they want to slow down more a
little

  less throttle

  it is not done so in french ships and
the english often they do not touch the
throttle bourchard explained i was
angry when you threw me from the engine
room without justice i saw the oiler pre-
tend to pick up his jumper and stoop near
the throttle in french ships when we
want less speed we take one turn with the
reversing wheel

  losh macdermut ejaculated one
turn o the reversing gear aye it wud cut
down the steam expansion aye it would
have that effect

b

ob and i had spent the afternoon
at the racetrack hc comes east
from texas annually and plways
wants to see the ponies go round-
at dinner that evening he said-

  i knew the greatest jockey in the world
well nearly every racing fan has an
opinion on that subject so i passed

  he was the only jockey i ever heard of
who never lost a race bob continued

  when any one begins talking like that you
might as well lay down your hand i
played with a salt cellar for a few seconds
and then asked-

  what was his name

  bob answered at considerable length

his name was dogie any-
way that was what they called
him at home in school the boys
called him wart you re-
member a dogie is the cow-country word for
a runt a calf of stunted growth

  this boy had eight brothers every one
of them was six feet tall or over but dogie
stopped growing at five foot one the folks
around home thought he was sickly at first
even his mother was afraid there might be
something the matter with him but there
wasnt anything wrong he was just a
dogie at that time people didnt know
much about what causes dwarfs it is
something wrong with the pituitary gland
whatever that is sometimes it causes
giants too i read this in a book the
giants are often dumb-bells and they dont

usually live long but the dwarfs are bright
they generally live long and enjoy good
health you can look it up for yourself if
the subject interests you

 anyway this kid was regarded as sickly
although he had muscles like piano wires
he spent the first eight years of his life
dodging around crying to keep out from un-
der the feet of his cithers and father
they were so big and dogjfi- was so little
that life for him was one continuous danger

  out on the ranch where they lived the
work called for weight as well as strength
you take breaking a colt for instance and
a midget is at a disadvantage it is the
same way with handling yearlings youve
got to have some weight as well as strength

  about the only thing this kid was good
for around the place was to grease the wind-
mills he was the best in the world at that
job because he was so short it didnt make
any difference how the thing flapped around
in the breeze it wouldnt knock him off the
platform he was under it

  but when dogies big brothers played he
had to stay out of the way there just simply
wasnt a safe place for that kid on the ranch
after he got ouf of his mothers lap unless he
took to the brush so he took to the brush

  now im not going to try to feed you any
sentimental slush about him talking to the
birds and animals because i want to tell you
just what he did he would sit for hours
watching them if you have got the pa-
tience to go and do the same thing why
after a while theyll get used to you


dogie



animals havent such sharp eyes as people
say they take notice of a motion a lot more
quickly than of anything standing still
but after they get used to a person standing
still if he moves slowly and doesnt scare
them theyll go on about their business
without paying much attention

  thats what dogie used to do its
simple if you understand it but very few
persons do what im leading up to is that
dogie got animal wise he got so he could
watch their eyes and know just what they
were going to do next like a prize fighter
watches his opponent he was queer that
way whenever you see any one who
knows animals like dogie knew them you
never forget him it shows in his eyes

  horses especially were like people to
dogie he would sit on a corral fence or
out in the pasture and look at them all day
if one made a mistake about something got
hold of the wrong weed or made a clumsy
movement dogie would laugh ive seen a
horse look up when the kid was laughing
as much as to say-

  well thats one on me

  horses are a queer kind of animal any-
way i have always suspected that they
are not entirely devoid of a sense of humor
and ill tell you why there was a colt out
on the ranch that seemed to be just chock
full of mischief hed pick up an empty
oat sack in his teeth and then parade
around offering the other end of it to any
horse that would like to play usually an-
other colt would catch hold and then theyd
tug and pull for the sack while the whole
corral looked on if the other horses didnt
enjoy the show then they certainly fooled
me-and i know a few things about horses
my own self i saw this colt one day
march up to dogie and offer him the sack
dogie took it and then had the merriest kind
of a romp

  we didnt have any moving-picture shows
in those days or much of any other kind of
entertainment out in the country so the
boys used to get up races and turkey shoots
and things like that wed measure off a
mile and send the horses over it owners
riding yes and betting too it wasnt
against the law then

  the first time i ever saw dogie at one of
these races he was about eleven years old
he had sneaked down into the pasture and
run off with the funniest old bag of bones
that ever wore horsehide it was the only

horse he dared to take without danger of it
being missed

  dogie arrived with twenty-five cents and
the gambling fever so we let him in it
seemed like a shame to take his money but
the poor kid was always being crowded out
of everything on account of his size and i
thought it would be kinder to let him run and
lose his two bits than to hurt his feelings i
said so and the boys agreed to let him run
poor old dogie didnt even have a saddle
we cow hands thought a fancy saddle was
essential to a race dogie had done his best
when he swiped the horse he didnt dare
go near the barn to get a saddle because
that would have been a dead give-away

  i offered to let him have mine for one race
but he wouldnt take it he had a buck-
skin thong with two little eye holes in it tied
around his horse and he stuck his big toes
into the holes that was his saddle his
bridle was a halter made out of rope and he
carried a willow switch that he had cut on
the way well the entries lined up and i
fired my pistol

away they went dogie in the
lead from the first jump some-
how that boy could always get
his mount off in the lead i think
it was because he simply became part of
the horse he was used to riding bareback
and knew every muscle in the animal he
had a way of clamping down with his knees
just at the proper second dogies old bag
of bones looked awful funny out there in the
lead humping itself up at every jump and
bringing all four feet together in midair
so that they almost interfered with each
other

  the picture suggested a drunken goat
and the funniest thing of all was that the
horse ran with his head down darned if
it didnt look to me like he was going kind
of sidewise and scouring the whole road as
he moved along

  all of us laughed and some of the boys in
the race said afterward that they nearly fell
out of their saddles but just the same that
old nag was moving dogie rode with a
sort of swaying motion like a sailboat when
the waves are coming against it from one
side he was holding a tight rein if you can
call a halter a rein and had evidently hypno-
tized that old horse into thinking they were
just breezing along he always knew how
to kid an animal


 adventure

  i thought his nag would wear out about
two-thirds of the way home and finish last
but when they came into the stretch dogie
was still a length in the lead thats when
the other boys in the race cut loose with
whip and spur three of them came abreast
and then two went ahead of him they
were the two we thought would win so no
one was surprized

  about half-way down the stretch dogie
sort of lengthened out as if he was going to
stand up in the saddle and then he laid
himself out along his horses neck you
would have thought he was afraid the poor
old brute might run right out from under
him it sure was a funny sight but kind
of graceful in a way too

  dogie reached back and used his switch a
couple of times and right then and there
business picked up he had kidded that old
bag of bones into thinking it was a two year
old the response wasnt beautiful but it
sure was effective

  when a horse lets himself out with all hes
got it always looks as if he turns into india
rubber and becomes two feet longer and a
lot thinner dogies nag couldnt get much
thinner but he shot in between the two
leaders and thundered under the tape a
neck in the lead

  the spectators stood there blinking with
their mouths open while dogie hopped off
his mount and made a bee-line to where i
was standing to collect four bits we al-
ways bet even money the horse instantly
forgot all about the race and began eating
grass he was probably the lowest-down
beast that ever came under a wire first

  it took a long time for us boys to realize
that dogies riding had anything to do with
his unfailing good luck at the races we
let him run every time he wanted to but
after a while we barred him from riding for
any one else that was done on the ground
of his weight there wasnt a hundred
pounds of him even when you included his
shirt pants and pocket knife moreover
he didnt use a saddle

  we would have imposed a handicap on
him but he generally rode such a sorry
beast that he had already handicapped him-
self beyond anything we could do also
we didnt like to admit that he was the best
rider in three counties that went too strong
against our pride dogies regular price for
winning a horse race for some one else was
ten cents there was an additional under-

standing that if he lost the owner didnt
owe him anything but he always col-
lected

  after a while it occurred to us boys that
we might be able to recover some of the
money dogie had taken away from us by
backing him against cowhands farther
away the standard wage on ranches in
those days was fifteen dollars a month con-
sequently we didnt have to lose over five
dollars to be crippled

  so we picked out some of our best ponies
and stirred up races in five adjoining
counties dogie redeemed himself by put-
ting us back onour feet financially then
we became ambitious nothing less than the
county fairs would satisfy us in the course
of these local races we had got a pretty good
line on our horses in fact we settled upon
one as the fastest horse in the world which
was fair enough since none of us had stop
watches this horses name was persim-
mon a big stallion with a disposition so sour
that no other name would fit him

the business of getting that
brute to a county fair turned out
to be rather complicated first
of all we had to form a syndicate of
twenty partners to pay the expense then
dogie went hog wild and demanded a dollar
for riding him next we had to give up a
couple of the nearest fairs in order to wait
until all members of the syndicate had
enough money to make bets

  during this delay a new complication
arose that threatened to leave us without a
jockey there was an old horse on the
ranch that no one but dogie could catch
this beast had to be harnessed for work
every day so dogies father objected to the
kids going away he had been playing
hide-and-go-seek with this horse every
morning for several years and was therefore
accountable for its bad habits

  this horse was a dark bay about ten
years old-hed go down among the trees in
the lower pasture and stand right still that
made it hard to see him you cant tell me
he didnt know it either dogies father
would send the boy down into the pasture
after him and then the game would start

  now nearly every one else would have
run his legs off but dogie had too much
animal sense hed pick out a spot where
he could see a lot of the pasture and wait
until his eyes were well adjusted to the light
dogie t



under the trees then hed put his fingers in
his mouth and whistle very sharply that
would make the horses ears turn in the di-
rection ct the sound

  if just one ear was visible dogie would
spot him the horse always stood so that
he could peek around a tree if his eyes
met dogies hed trot up and take the bridle
but if dogie had missed him hed go on
standing still that was their game no
one else knew how to play it so the syndi-
cate had to put up two more hard-earned
dollars to pay for oats so the horse could be
kept in the corral while dogie was away

  however we finally got persimmon to the
post with dogie on him every member of
the syndicate was draped over the fence
around the racetrack clutching the evidence
of his fifteen-dollar bet one months
wages

  a shot was fired and they were off nine of
them dogie in the lead as usual all of us
syndicate members were feeling very com-
fortable when we saw persimmon round the
first turn a length ahead but on the far side
of the track he fell back gradually until he
was seven

  i want to tell you that was terrible the
same thought occurred to all of us dogie
was riding one of those little trick saddles
that they insist upon at fancy races and we
were afraid he was handicapped he was
used to a regular saddle or none at all we
were worried three horses dropped out
of the running as they came into the stretch
leaving the three leaders well bunched and
persimmon trailing them by two lengths
i never had seen horses go quite that fast
before so the outlook was far from satis-
factory

  just to keep our courage up we began
yelling-

  come on dogie

  and then the kid went through that funny
straightening-out process of his i think
he always did more steering with his knees
than with the reins he was strong as a
gorilla persimmons got the message and
closed in like a streak i saw him disappear
behind a black horse that was leading and
then i saw his nose come out on the far side

  just at that moment a policeman pulled
me off the fence tom badley was also
arrested they fined him ten dollars for
firing his pistol in the air but we collected
our bets five for one and spent the whole
evening riding the hobby horses and drink-

ing soda pop i dont know why it is but a
cowboy never can stay off those wooden
horses at a county fair

  that evening i said to dogie

  boy you come mighty nigh to killing
twenty of the best friends youve got in the
world why didnt you keep persimmon in
the lead all the way

  dogie looked at me with pity for my
ignorance

  persimmon dont like to run that way
he said he wants to chase after the others
and then go ahead of them otherwise he
dont enjoy the race

  imagine a kid saying anything like that
youd think he had been talking to the
horse

  after this race we cowhands saw wealth
coming our way all we had to do was en-
ter persimmon and dogie in every race we
could find but a new obstacle presented
itself dogie had also made a fifteen dollar
bet consequently he was now rich and ready
to retire

  for a year he had been planning a start in
the business of raising hogs and i learned
afterward that every cent he had ever
earned was stowed away in a sugar bowl
guarded by his mother he was a wistful
little fellow always wanting to show off
for his mother his brothers were all such
big fellows and every one spoke so well of
them that dogie was afraid his mother
wouldnt be proud of him he knew she
loved him like a baby but he wanted to be
regarded as a man

  he used to tell her that when he grew up
he would buy her something real pretty
with the money in the old sugar bowl poor
kid he did his best to swagger but he simply
couldnt get away with it in that family
just about the time he thought he was going
good one of his brothers would come in and
announce that a banker had offered to lend
him five thousand dollars on his own note to
buy a herd of yearlings

  that was the kind of a family he lived in
it was-for a dwarf

-	so he plunged into the hog

sgjj business three months later he
had half a dozen pens full of pigs
but the ranch missed several rains
and his corn crop burned to a beautiful
golden brown in other words dogie had
the choice of buying feed or putting the
whole family on a steady diet of young


adventure

pork every cent he had except one hun-
dred dollars was tied up he had held out
that much for emergencies i remember
the morning he set out for town to buy
grain youd have thought he was going to
his own funeral

  in town he met a man named smith and a
horse named geyser both of them were
fugitives from justice and neither had very
good prospects for his next meal this fel-
low smith was a crook and the horse was a
lunatic lots of race horses are crazy but
there never was a crazier one than geyser

  his latest outburst had just got smith
into serious trouble a jockey used his
whip on geyser when they were coming
down the stretch and he jumped clear over
the railing several persons were hurt
as a result smith dodged a sheriff and man-
aged to get away with geyser but a court
order tied up most of his money and two
other horses he owned

  i dont know how he happened to come
to our town probably he didnt have much
choice of trains anyway there he was
trying to sell geyser and at the same time
keep a string tied to him his offer was one
hundred dollars for the horse with an
option to buy him back for two hundred
dollars within a month he needed the
hundred to reach friends and get money
but no one wanted his horse they could
look at geyser and tell that he was a wild
one

  dogie heard the talk around town and
then went to see the cause of it he was
already headed for bankruptcy so he de-
cided to take a gamble an additional
hundred dollars within a month would just
about pull him out of the hole

  dogie bought geyser and rode him home
smith protested and so did almost every one
else in town but dogie never had the slight-
east uneasiness on the subject of his ability
to reach a friendly understanding with a
horse he and geyser looked at each other
for about an hour before they set out for
the ranch and after that they seemed to
speak each others language there were
no apples or carrots or sugar or anything
like that in the process of getting ac-
quainted they had just made up to each
other in their own way thats all there
was to it

  dogie and his speculation had a pretty
hard time for two weeks if any one else
on the ranch went into the corral where

geyser was penned one or the other of them
would pretty soon try to climb out-usually
both dogies father and brothers made up
a purse of twenty-five dollars and bought
some feed for the hogs but they had more
than twenty-five dollars worth of fun at
dogies expense

  they used to tell the kid there were only
two ways for him to escape the poorhouse
either feed the hogs to geyser or geyser to
the hogs this joke had a two-edged mean-
ing hogs will eat flesh of course but the
boys were insinuating that geyser also
would take to a diet of raw meat

  dogie used to say to his mother

  mr smith will come back dont you
think so mama

  he was so loaded down with business
cares that his mother had to come to the
rescue with moral support so she usually ex-
pressed faith in smith

  except at meal times dogie kept out of
the way hed saddle geyser every day and
give him a run for exercise he told me
afterward that geyser was the first and only
horse he ever handled that really had racing
instinct geyser was a thoroughbred all
right but he was six years old and never had
settled down six years is old for a race
horse he was a gray-beard and still wild

  i looked up his record and found that he
had won some wonderful races but he had
also come in last several times in other
words geyser was one of those crazy animals
with a yard of pedigree that will run or not
just as he pleases what tickled dogie
though was his eagerness to run ahead of
spot the dog spot liked to race i think
most dogs do especially if they have gone
over the track a few times

  well one day smith came back and he
brought the promised two hundred dollars
so business was looking up for dogie our
rural telephone was out of commission that
day so smith had to come out to the ranch
in person when he heard that dogie had
been racing geyser against spot every
morning he nearly fainted

  its an eighth wonder you arent dead
he said

  and then he told us about geysers play-
ful habits i gathered that no one was safe
when geyser took the bit in his teeth
likely as not hed climb up into the judges
stand and bite one of the officials while
smith talked the rest of us sort of peeped at
dogies mother to see what impression all
dogie



this was making we were uneasy because
she worried some about the kid natur-
ally he wasnt much different from a baby
to her because all of the other boys grew so
tall but she wasnt scared at all she
laughed

  do you think i am joking smith asked
her

  i know you are not joking she said
but you and geyser just never happened to
meet any one who can ride like dogie

  i think that conversation was what put
the idea into smiths head to take dogie
with him the kid was afraid he wouldnt
get permission so he went without asking
and telegraphed after they were over the
louisiana state line he probably thought
the state line protected him in some way
none of us worried about his going because
dogie always had a lot of common sense
we knew he could ride and we had heard
that a good jockey was better paid than a
cow hand the only uncertain element
was smith he didnt measure up very
high in our estimation

the next we heard from dogie
he was at a hotel in new orleans
and scheduled for a race one week
later he was going to ride gey-
ser and he said the odds would be twelve to
one he was wishing he had some money
to bet and some one to bet it for him be-
cause he didnt understand just how it was
done at a regular race track also he didnt
believe theyd let him bet smith he
wrote wouldnt let him have any money
for fear he might take a notion to go home

  i didnt have much work on hand at the
time so i went to new orleans for the
races dogie was tickled pink to be so im-
portant he showed me around the town
as if he owned it i told him i was going to
bet ten dollars nine on him and one on
geyser in our set that was pretty heavy
gambling so the kid was impressed how-
ever it looked to me like a good bet on a
purely gambling basis i dont usually bet
as you know but they had been clocking the
horses and plain figures showed that geyser
was the fastest the question was whether
hed run on the track or all over the neigh-
boring counties people said that some
days he wouldnt run at all geyser was a
prima donna with an ingrowing disposition
so he went on the score board as a twelve-to-
one shot

  on the opening day of the winter race-
meet i received a letter from dogies mother
inclosing five twenty-dollar bills she
wanted me to place a bet on dogie none
of us ever mentioned geyser youd have
thought the boy was entered as a horse in-
stead of a jockey the letter said i was to
tell dogie about the bet only after he won
and then turn the money over to him for
further instructions thats like a woman
they never think of the possibility of losing

  but i happened to know where she got the
hundred dollars and my conscience was un-
easy that hundred dollars was chicken and
egg money the accumulation of a good
many months so i wired her

  has it occurred to you that he might
lose answer

  she wired back

  sure he might lose but he is my baby
  so i bet the hundred dollars 

  some people dont get much kick out of
a horse race unless they have a bet posted
but if i bet i get so much kick i dont enjoy
the sport money out our way doesnt
come easy we work for it turning loose
one hundred dollars that afternoon for a
bookmakers slip of paper was just about as
hard a job as i ever undertook a mental
picture of dogies mother feeding his hogs
and wishing him luck haunted me until the
horses left the post

  there were ten starters rather a large list
so the men in red jackets had to work
pretty hard getting them lined up and
geyser gave them more trouble than any
other three i dont know just how dogie
managed it but whenever he brought a
horse to the post the animal was already
crouching for a spring dogie seemed to
know how to give him news of the situation
and put him on edge for the getaway i
think it must have been the way he sat or
some special sort of knee pressure he
could get a horse crouched for a spring even
when riding him for the first time that
boy simply spoke horse language with his
legs

  well finally they got away geyser in the
lead and cutting across for a place next to
the rail dogie was always afraid of being
jostled in the first turn of the track he
would either have got away in the lead or
kept them there all day after the first
turn he let geyser breeze along until four
horses were ahead of him and two others
gaining


adventure

  i was watching their heads and tails bob
up and down on the far side of the track
when smith came up beside me and began
to groan it looked to him like geyser
wouldnt run i didnt know whether he
would or wouldnt but i felt mighty uneasy
about that hundred dollars when i listened
to the groans i told smith that it looked
to me like dogie was keeping clear for the
inside position and dodging trouble at the
second turn but smith just sputtered
he sounded like a leaking steam valve
he said they were going to pocket geyser
on the turn and sure enough they did

  it was dogies first experience against
real track generalship i dont know much
about such things but i could see that they
had worked him away from the rail on the
turn and at the same time crowded the track
in front of him evidently they judged
geyser was going to run if he got a chance
this maneuver brought seven horses into
the stretch pretty well bunched four ahead
of geyser two behind

  and then dogie lengthened out in that
funny way of his falling forward along the
horses neck well sir you would have
thought a bee had stung old geyser his
belly drew in and his whole body lengthened
out it actually looked like his neck got
longer the only question after that was
whether he could overcome a lead of nearly
two lengths in such a short distance if he
could dogies mother was certainly going to
collect twelve hundred dollars

  just at that time it would have helped my
nerves a lot if dogie had been using a whip
but he didnt geyser was too temper-
amental the whole job was being done by
power of suggestion geyser shot through
a space between two horses just in front of
him and then went after the favorite a
slender light bay as pretty a horse as
i have ever seen and running like a
deer

  geyser ran more like a -- he was a
mean scoundrel and just as crazy as any-
thing in an asylum but tireless dogie had
kidded the old idiot into thinking he had the
bit in his teeth and was cutting up dust
and clods of dirt began to shoot out behind
him and the space between him and that
light bay just closed up like some one shut-
ting a door personally though i think
the finest thing about that race was that it
didnt last long because i couldnt have
stood much more geyser thundered un-

der the wire half a length ahead and then
danced all over the track when dogie tried
to stop him he didnt seem to be the least
bit tired or winded

  smith said to me-

  he got loose and ran away

     tea that evening at the table dogie
     sr  said to me

            i can win with this horse any
time i start unless they show me
the dockers report on a faster one hes
the easiest horse to fool that i ever struck
he just simply hasnt got any sense at all
the only thing i have to do is jump him into
the lead and get his racing fever up then we
breeze along until some of them pass us
a horse doesnt think as fast as a man it
takes more time for him to get mad if the
jockey gets worried first and tries to hurry
geyser he goes crazy but just play like you
havent noticed that there is a race going on
and he takes the bit in his teeth and runs
away

  did he run away with you i asked

  sure dogie answered but the sweet
part of it is that i can make the poor old
idiot run away every time hes crazy i
tell you i could kid that horse out of his
eye teeth i wish i had a thousand dollars
to bet on him tomorrow

  that was the psychological moment so
i hauled out the twelve hundred dollars and
laid it on the table dogie nearly fell into
his soup it was the first time in his life
that he had seen more than two hundred
cash he counted it until i thought the
figures would wear off before he came to
and asked me where i got it

  when i told him he had to struggle to
choke back the tears the only living
thing he was maudlin about was his mother
the presidency wouldnt have meant half so
much to him as her bet by some fortunate
accident i had sense enough to show him
his mothers letter and not display the tele-
gram in which she referrred to him as her
baby later in the evening i burned the
telegram as insurance against possible
accidents

  ill tell you what well do he said
well hold out the two hundred then
mama is bound to double her money to-
morrow you bet the thousand on dogie to
win dont bother with place or show
that lunatic either comes in ahead or bites
himself and dies of hydrophobia
dogie



  i bet the thousand as directed but the
odds had gone down to six to one there
were several persons who thought geyser
had at last found his master and quite a few
bets were being placed that forced down
the odds no one disputed the horses
speed

  well dogie repeated racing people
are quick on the trigger when they make up
their minds and five men were hunting for
dogie that night they said he looked to
them just like what i told you he was the
greatest jockey in the world they wanted
him

  he and i talked over the situation before
we went to bed i said-

  dogie youve got a career ahead of you
in this game if you want it

  i dont want it bob dogie said
these are the funniest looking people i
ever met in my life a lot of those fellows
that mill around under the grandstand look
to me like crooks smith looks like a crook
too if you have my six thousand tucked
away close to your hide i think well cut
out of here while the going is good it must

be pretty hard on mama having to feed
those hogs every day

  i said

  dogie no man could quit with a cleaner
record than yours you have won every
race you ever started in and never had a
first-class mount in your life

  so dogie and i lit out for texas hes
done right well in the hog business but he
still loves horse races hes got a track of
his own now and the races are conducted
according to his own idea dogie trots out
a couple of colts lines them up and starts
them-no jockeys the one that comes
under the wire first gets an apple or a lump
of sugar that may sound slow to you but
dogie nearly goes cuckoo with excitement
one day he fell off the fence and broke his
arm rooting for geysers grandson

bob i said to him afterward
you never did tell me his name
dogie and wart are just nick-
names whats his last name
its the same as mine bob replied
hes my kid brother

here were three traders on
jijilap one was the scotchman
duncan macintosh a capable
man but a dour one whose wrath
flamed when they insulted his clan-as they
often did-by addressing him as mack-
intosh or even mcintosh showing thereby
their ignorance and disregard of gaelic
customs macintosh was inclined to drink
too much trade gin for the good of his liver
but his head was adamant to alcoholic at-
tack he was long and lean when he first
came to the south pacific and years of
tropic sun had reduced him to what was
little better than a working skeleton it
had not so affected henry harrison from
sydney

  unlike macintosh harrison abused his
own patronymic he cheerily styled him-
self ennery arrison and considered that he
was speaking the kings english not that
being australian he cared much about the
king merely a person who in harrisons
opinion  ad been born with a golden crown
in is mouth the lucky stiff and was really
no whit better than himself who had sever-
al gold crowns in his own mouth born of
youthful carelessness parental indulgence
cheap candy and chalky teeth

  ennery was strong for the hempire
he was not as efficient in many ways
as macintosh but the natives would do
more for him he was an amiable drunk-
ard and a fine pool-player before he went
into trading for the starlight soap com-
pany but even if he could have imported



a pool table to jijilap the cockroaches would
have eaten the cloth inside a week

  harrison had the complexion of a new
brick a paunch that nothing could dimin-
ish blue eyes that twinkled and a yellow-
ish sun-bleached mustache of which he was
inordinately proud though it would have
suited the makeup of a trooper in a crack
cavalry regiment better than  ennerys
round moon of a face

  macintosh worked for another com-
pany their stations several miles apart
there was lots of copra available on jijilap
which was natively ruled over by three
chiefs who were brothers and who divided
the island into three sections each starting
at the tiptop of the volcanic mountain
crest that still emitted vapor and some-
times growled in its sleep as if with indi-
gestion down through grassy uplands
thick bush across beach and lagoon to the
outer reef three great slices of island pie

  a pie full enough of plums for all of
them fish from the reef lagoon and beach
coconuts and fruit from the lowlands be-
sides the products of the cultivated fields
wild pig from the grasslands and crags
birds from the forest whose plumage was
used for adornment and the bodies of
the wood pigeons for food a goodly
heritage divided between them by matesei
the king on his deathbed

  vetesi and puhoteke second and third
sons respectively were well satisfied but
haiti the eldest son who had dreamed
that all the kingdom should be his was
the three traders



discontented and the more he brooded over
the matter the more his injury grew he
had a wife minea the daughter of the
high chief of the island of kasilak who
fostered his dissatisfaction and embittered
it for the sake of her son

   with clever words she sowed the seed of
ambition in the minds of kaitis followers
watering it with the suggestion of greater
i possessions and the pick of the women of
puhoteke and vetesi telling them that
kaiti was the rightful ruler and that they
were kaitis men but it was only seed
that had not yet germinated and so far
there was no hatred between the three
clans save in the hearts of kaiti and minea
his wife

  even on jijilap blood was thicker than
water and kinship still prevailed only
kaiti grew more and more sour as the
ferment of thwarted aspirations worked
within him and minea kneaded the mass
subtly kaiti drank more and more kawa
and toddy made from the inflorescence of
the coco-palm and the liquor slowly changed
the chemistry of his spirit to gall

  since he could not arouse enthusiasm
among his followers to rise and massacre
their kin he spent the hours brewing hatred
against all the world and the three white
men in particular restrained from murder-
ing the latter because he was afraid of their
superior mana or supernatural power and
of their guns

   macintosh was in the territory of puho-
teke harrison in that of vetesi the third
white man had his place on the beach in the
land of kaiti there was no open enmity
among the three brothers their people
visited with each other and feasts were held
together in full friendship gifts interchanged
and there was intermarriage with no lines
drawn for trespass puhoteke and vetesi
were friendly to the whites who brought
them trade of tobacco salmon cloth and
other matters in exchange for coconuts
candle and ivory nutsand labor at copra time

  sometimes kaiti traded with them also
first with one and then with the other trying
to establish ill-feeling between the two since
he could cause either one to show more
profit than the other if kaiti favored him
also he tried to get more in trade by playing
one against the other these schemes being
the schemes of minea his wife who was a
clever handsome jealous ambitious vin-
dictive and unscrupulous female

the third white man was also a
trader but he worked for no firm
and he did not bother about
copra or any kinds of nuts about
sharks fins or beche-de-mer or turtle shell
the natives knew him for a merikani-
american-said that his nose was shaped
like a canoe and marveled at his everlasting
energy macintosh and harrison gener-
ally referred to him as the yank

  they did not exactly dislike him but there
was a certain racial antipathy between
them that had started about the year 
and had never entirely died down the
world war had done something to restore
matters but macintosh who was fifty-four
had been too old to recruit and harrison
who had an irregular heart had not been
permitted to whereas jim clinton had
done his bit and had a couple of decorations
stowed away somewhere that he never
showed and never looked at the war was
over and he had gone back to the south
seas determined at thirty to make his
pile quickly in the pearl-shell lottery

  he was leaner longer and browner than
macintosh and his eyes were gray he was
as hard as nails and he kept himself in shape
living on jijilap only during the diving sea-
son leaving it when the rains started for
suva where he lived simply and took in the
moving pictures the restaurants the band
concerts and the radio programs mac-
intosh and harrison stayed on their jobs
the scot because he could save money the
australian because he was always in debt
to the starlight people since the price of
squareface had advanced and his salary had
not his employers were not philanthro-
pists any more than macintoshs

  a certain amount of friction was kept
alive on sundry occasions when clinton
hoisted on the pole that stood outside his
shack the stars and stripes on these
occasions macintosh flaunted the scarlet
cross of saint andrew on its white ground
and harrison the blue ensign with its one
big star and five smaller ones of the austra-
lian commonwealth

  on their own national holidays they flew
the union jack and clinton came back with
the american ensign once again on the
whole they were several grades above
friendly enemies at fairly regular inter-
vals they visited with each other grogged
together smoked together and wished each
other good luck clinton knew they called
o

adventure

him yank and realized there was an
assumption of superiority therein that did
not bother him for they were both work-
ing on salary and a slim a very slim com-
mission and he was getting along very
nicely with his pearl shell

  not pearls they were too much like
angels visits few and far between but
first-class black-edged pearl shell top qual-
ity heavy weight without wormholes
shell in great demand for buttons for the
handles of fancy cutlery for inlay work in
oriental lacquer and european papier-
mache and for various forms of ornamen-
tation and cheaper jewelry

  he was the working partner under a lease
that he would have had trouble in getting for
himself being an american from the aus-
tralian commonwealth that since the war
reckoned jijilap as its lawful possession and
to whom the three chiefs were only titular
owners the sleeping partner had made the
original discovery garnered the shell within
the twelve-fathom depth and gone back to
sydney where he married a wife who dis-
approved severely of any husband of hers-
she was a widow-going away overnight
much less sojourning in the south seas
which she mentally peopled with lascivious
and much too attractive sirens whose cop-
pery skin was likely to be much too lavishly
displayed she disapproved strongly of
clinton despite the fact that he was an-
nually giving them an increasing income
that bade fair to become in time a tidy for-
tune

  the sleeping partner put up the lease
his discovery of the shell and the necessary
capital and clinton who was not called
a yank without reason put in his brains
and labor on a sliding scale that gave him
fifty per cent up to a certain yield and
after that an increasing amount as the net
profits grew larger since the original
lessee considered the field on jijilap fairly
well exhausted he had signed the sublease
contract thinking he had all the best of it

  clinton imported six men from the
tuamotus members of the fearless but
friendly tribes of those dangerous isles
he brought three diving-suits two iof the
pick of his men one for himself and find-
ing banks of the fine shell at a depth where
even modern diving was close to its limit he
utilized the ingenuity of yankeedom and
devised many contrivances

  sometimes he went under himself and

made survey of the ledges later on placing
dynamite where whole sections could be
displaced without much loss of shell to be
later brought up by dredges and tongs
every season his schooner was well filled
with the precious freight which he sold
sometimes in singapore and sometimes in
suva

  his blasting kept his section of the lagoon
fishless and for this he paid tribute to
kaiti to compensate him for loss of natural
revenue otherwise he was independent of
him too much so for the greed of the chief
who did not recognize the fact that he was
after all only a chief by courtesy of the
commonwealth

  so the remote isle of jijilap on the fourth
of july in the year nineteen hundred and
twenty-odd with the stars and stripes snap-
ping in the trade and further along the coast
the banners of macintosh and harrison
paradoxically celebrating-or perhaps de-
fying-the birth of american independence

  clinton made it a holiday but they did
not in his bush capita kaiti grouched and
drank kawa which affects bodily but not
mental coordination and listened to the
counsel of minea his wife who told him
that he was a fool not to make all the white
men pay him tribute instead of demanding
labor and to make kalinitoni pay double
what he did now otherwise to make
trouble

  you say it is your island she pressed
him did you not say so when you came
to my father for me perhaps you lied to
me or you have drowned your manhood
in kawa

  then as kaiti glowered at her with eyes
reddened by indulgence in the potent stuff
she called to a girl to make a fresh supply
after all the kawa made him more respon-
sive and she was careful not to cross him
knowing that when he broke loose he was
more fiend than man besides the liquor
kept him chained it paralysed his limbs
while he could still listen to her insinuating
talk she was a very clever woman
minea with far more brains that kaiti who
had the mind of a child the brawn of a
samson and the disposition of a spoiled a
badly spoiled and mischievous boy

  also minea had her own private hatreds-
againstf mesi the head wife of puhoteke
who had borne him five male children and
was always displaying them or talking
about them-against tuni the favorite
the three traders



of vetesi who was much better looking and
younger than minea and knew it

  if it is your island she said why do
you let them fly those war cloths lo
there are three white men and each has a
different cloth it is true that arisoni and
makinitosi sometimes fly the same one but
it is different from that of kalinitoni who
yesterday refused me twenty sticks of to-
bacco set those two against the one
kaiti and if there be any left kill him
for if you make them fight with each
other then the men of your brothers will
fight also for them and perhaps your
brothers may be killed

  at least they will be weakened are
you not the oldest of them all is not my
son and your son to rule here and not the
misshapen children of that lazy mesi-
this was a double lie-and the sons of
tuni who pretends that she is with child so
that vetesi will give her yet more gifts

does not-

  your tongue clacks like the wind in the
palms said kaiti be silent bring me
the fresh bowl of kawa and begone

  she went but she saw his reddened eyes
regarding the cloth with the white stars on
the blue ground and the red bars against
die white rippling audaciously and there
was a smile on her face asshe left the terrace

after clinton had set the flag
flying he took his swim while
upolu his paumotuan jack-of-
all-trades cooked breakfast he
stroked out to the anchored raft from which
he dredged and hauled out on it much like
a seal basking in the early sunlight and
watching the flag flapping whistling yan-
kee doodle half unconsciously and shifting
into a more modern rendition of the theme
in a voice that was somewhat nasal but still
musical

        im a yankee-doodle dandy
        im a yankee-doodle boy

  his thoughts clicked off in retrospect
george cohan with his eccentric dance and
his eccentric hair-really born on the
fourth of july-then later shows he had
seen a vision of broadway glittering with
colored lights and packed sidewalk to side-
walk with footfolk and motorfolk herded
by autocratic traffic cops it all seemed a
long way and a long long time from
jijilap

  the last of the mist was trailing from the
crags soon there would be only the wisp
of vapor from the somnolent crater a
flock of sooty terns slid croaking from the
forest flapping out to sea the sun high
enough now to bathe the beach in golden
glow had dissolved the gloomy shadows
of the woods and the island was draped in a
mantle of emerald and jade the pigeons
crooned and the green and vermilion para-
keets squawked and screamed back of
him the reef boiled and hissed on the flood
tide and every little while the overflow sent
a long wave seething gently shoreward
lifting the big raft

  it sure is beautiful said clinton aloud
but id swap it all for five minutes in a
taxicab on fifth avenue if the luck holds
ill be there this time next year and well cel-
ebrate prohibition or no prohibition

  ill clean my guns and overhaul my
tackle this morning he told himself and
as soon as the sun gets off the lagoon well
go and try that pool upolu talks so much
about ill have the boys row me over to
harrisons after supper even if it is the
fourth of july macll be there and ill
get him to give us cutty sark that  put
him in a good humor and ennery can tell
me all about the time he won the snooker-
pool championship of sydney or whatever
it was well smoke the pipe of peace bury
the hatchet and forget lexington and
bunker hill come home by moonlight
regular hands-across-the-sea program
im hanged if im not as lonesome as a lost
purp in a snowstorm

  gee id give a ton of shell to go on a
snowshoe hike snow ive forgotten what
it looks like

  upolu appeared and called and he slid
into the water to stalk out lean and muscu-
lar to breakfast

  the shadow of the mountain crept down
its flanks and out across the glassy surface
of the lagoon there was plenty of day-
light or twilight back of the crags the
sun was blazing slowly gathering to itself
the glory of sunset the booming of the
mountain pigeons came from the forest
the sooty terns came flapping back from
the bush streaks of pale-blue smoke rose
like slender columns skyward for the sea-
wind had gone and the landwind not yet
risen

  scarlet footed boatswain birds white as
snow sank like flakes among the palms and


adventure

 breadfruits croaking fretfully the chat-
 tering parrakeets discussed the day shoals
 of fish darted away beneath the hull of the
 dingey as they paddled leisurely for upolus
 pool of abundance they had taken part
 of their supper with them and a flat stone
 on which to make fire and broil the catch
 native fashion

   upolu spoke in soft tones as they made
 for the shallows and at last softly lowered
 the anchor two fathoms to rest on the edge
 of the swiftly shelving sides of the pool as
 the boat swung head on to the current

   upolu produced his treasures hooks that
 were self-baiting beautifully made of two
 pieces of lustrous shell united with sennit
 so fashioned that they twisted like a hurt
 minnow as they were raised and lowered
 near the bottom the fish bit avidly pink
 and silver groupers and blue-backed sea
 salmon a burnished treasury that gleamed
 in the twilight while the faint phosphor-
 escence streaked from the taut lines as they
 hauled them in

   upolu turned chef and they ate lux-
 uriously before they started smoking
 back of the mountain the sky had turned to
 olive grading through aquamarine to prim-
 rose slowly fading soon the stars would
 come out with a rush the boat was deep
 with their catch

   well be getting along said clinton
 going to harrisons tonight

   there was a gleam of teeth the paumo-
 tuans had friends also there would be
 singing dancing on the beach

    maiti kalinitoni said upolu steward
 chef foreman and boatsteerer maiti no
 it is well

   then he clucked a warning a canoe
 was coming out of a creek in the mangroves
 half a mile away a double-outrigger with
 the paddlers seated abreast twenty of
 them the beautifully shaped craft had a
 high prow and stern in which pearl inlay
 winked faintly as it came on fast it was
 kaitis own canoe and he sat on a little plat-
 form by the stern

 f i wonder what the old cadger wants
 now said clinton and quietly hitched his
 automatic toward the front

    he had been carrying it with him of late
 kaiti had been getting a little out of hand
 in his demands his followers were amiable
 enough but kaitis was beginning to ask for
 gifts as if they were his by right clinton
 vdid not intend to see it that way

  there were spears in the canoe but that
was usual when a chief made a trip and
there was a musket between kaitis knees
an old springfield fifty-eight caliber
changed from its civil war percussion lock
to flint the nipple removed and a vent
opened up for priming flashpan and spring
added remade for trading and decorative
purposes more authoritative than harmful
a badge of authority kaitis scepter and his
fathers before him

vk the canoe came up with a back
vbfyx wash of the paddles stopped
alongside clinton had checked
the inhaul of his anchor and
showed no surprise

  i want tabaki samani grunted kaiti

 he was half drunk the odor of palm
toddy tainted the sweet air of the evening

  store closed up kaitis you too late
anyway this day no walk along work
besides youve had all thats coming to you
you old pirate plenty too much you
catch long time he added in beach ver-
nacular

  kaiti scowled reached out and picked
up one of the pearl hooks muttering in
jijilap too swiftly for clinton with his
limited vocabulary to follow he asked
upolu to translate

  he say that belong along him he say
you stealum all shell belong along him he
say you give big fellow pay along that shell
you no pay he make too much trouble
along of you

  kaiti was in a nasty humor minea had
turned counsel into nagging and he was
minded to show her that he could handle
things his own way already he had been
to harrisons demanding salmon and to-
bacco from macintosh he had asked gin
twin curt refusals had got under his choc-
olate-hued hide clinton was an interloper
his mind worked like a childs incapable of
planning a move ahead he was ugly
dangerous

 clintons eyes narrowed he was not
worried his gun was a luger chosen for
its long-range possibilities and he had no
question of his being able to put the canoe
out of commission if it was necessary he
was not looking for trouble but a clean-up
of the profitable shell and he had no quar-
rel with the tribesmen

  it would be simpler to demonstrate a
problem in geometry to kaiti than to make
the three traders



him recognize the fact that his island be-
longed to the australian commonwealth
no commissioner had formally taken over
jijilap no cruiser had ever visited it it had
known no reprisals for outbreak kaitis
father had been friendly with the whites
proud of having them on his island appre-
ciating the trade goods

  let me look along that hook he said
and took it from kaiti before the latters
drink-dulled low-grade brain understood
the move his pride rather prompting
him to believe that the traders soft tone
meant that he was willing to discuss the
matter

  then his face grew black with arush of
angry blood as clinton dropped it into his
pocket to have relinquished it would
have meant loss of prestige with kaitis
men and with his own

  the lagoon was beginning to reflect the
afterglow rosy vapor seemed to be rising
from its depths bream commenced to
leap their broad sides flashing

  that shell mine that puloa-hook-
mine growled kaiti his big fist clenched
about his musket you catch plenty big
fellow fish you give me half he used
the native word illustrating it with a swift
stroke down and one across the imaginary
line

  those my fish kaiti suppose you
want one all right

  a bream slid out of the glowing water
curved in the air taking the fly it had fan-
cied broadside to the right clinton
pulled his gun and fired it was not a hard
target as it hung for a moment in midleap
 if suspended but the effect of the shot
wag stclfthng the fish flopped on the sur-
face struggling to swim downwards its
bladder pierced its back broken

  upolu reached out  blade and brought it
in handing it to one of t men in kaitis
canoe impressed but furious kaiti or-
dered it flung overboard he snancii an
order and the canoe swung ahead the quick
strong paddles sending it forward at full
speed it made a wide curve and swept on
toward the mangroves into them vanished

  too much he mad i think said upolu
commencing to haul in the anchor now
we go along arrisoni boss

  clinton nodded wondering if he had not
been more showy than diplomatic

  hell have to stay mad then he said
im not going to stand for blackmail

kaiti was to all intents and
purposes mad just that be-
yond the little reason he possessed
he had been made to look small
in the eyes of his paddlers he had been
insulted in the worst fashion his dignity
had been flouted

  to offer a high chief overripe fruit a fish
that was not save for the slight prick of the
barbless hook inside its mouth as perfect as
when it swam even to present a dead bird
with ruffled feathers was an offence not to
be condoned as criminal as crossing the
royal shadow or breaking a royal tabu it
was unwitting on the part of clinton

  his men guessed at the trouble but dis-
missed it elated at the return of the hook
the good shot of clinton it was a small
thing but it was the last straw upon the
camel that carried the dignity of kaiti
for one of his own the penalty was death-
and not a swift one only by death could
it be forgotten or condoned i

  the breaking water the leaping bream
the quick shot and the crash of the dying
fish-only those had held his hand re-
strained his voice from ordering instant
battle his big frame shook with rage he
knew his paddlers avoiding his gaze were
wondering what ailed their chief he
ground his teeth in a fury as the canoe
grounded and he leaped ashore to the trail
that led to his village

  makinitosi arrisoni and then kalinitoni
all had refused him tribute all had treated
him a chief as if he were dirt

  he would show them he would spit
upon their war cloths and he would kill them
and drink the broth of their hearts seated
upon three coconuts to avoid evil but he
would not tell minea she would scold the
story would pass among the women among
the tribes kaiti had been made to look
small had been offered unfit food

  he who speaks of this thing he said to
his followers feeds sharks but the head
pf this white man i will hang upon the ridge-
pojf- of rny house and on either side shall
be the heads of arrisoni and makinitosi i
have spoken

  the men rolled their eyeballs in the gloom
and trailed him mutely up the narrow path
where the dense bush rose llke a wall on
either side wondering if this was jo be war
and how the brothers of kaiti who
friendly to arrisoni and makinitosi would
take it 


adventure

  it was cool on the mountain height the
fresh air and the climb sobered kaiti some-
what but did not abate the smart to his
pride there was only one salve for that
he must strike yet in the swirling fog
of desire for revenge that gathered in his
mind he saw one clear vision the white
man unafraid pocketing the hook then the
gleaming fish the flash and bark of the gun
that came from nowhere the dying bream
all in the winking of an eye

  aiel they shoot swift and straight
those white men

  and he had but a musket without much
powder and it would not hit a tree at
twenty paces

  he swilled kawa that night until his wives
lifted him helpless and put him on his
mats

macintosh never recited
burns-he pronounced it with at
least three rs rolling in the midst
of the revered name-until he
was mellow with hollands and as this
was not a holiday with him he was quite
sober when he arrived at harrisons far
soberer than harrison who invariably com-
menced his potations at suppertime and was
well into a bottle when the other ar-
rived

  i see said the scot that the yank is
fleein his gaudy banner tis na doot the
bir-r-thday o lincoln or washington or

harrison affecting to remember the name

   tis likely on the prohibition ticket
i dinna ken the yank voted for him
ah-h-h

  he achieved a combination of hollands

a young coconut containing a pint of cool
sweet liquid and a dash of bitters

  ill be able to spare ye but one case
henr-r-y he said as he wiped off the
ragged ends of his grizzled mustache by the
simple process of drawing the hairs into his
mouth by an almost prehensile lower lip
my last shipment was shor-r-t six cases
i r-r-efused kaiti any this mor-rnin he
wanted a case an came doon to a bottle
but i wad gie him none

  he told me he was thir-r-sty an i told

  harrison chuckled

  harrison grunted

  if youre siding with a --yank agen

  were three white men wi a common
ancestry an its fit we should a stand to-
gether in case of trouble wi kaiti
trouble wi kaiti ow

  ive been here langer than you henr-
r-y kaiti wants to tun the whole island
an minea has got br-rains im sorry we
baith had to tur-r-n him doon i the ane
day if he cud per-r-suade puhoteke an
vetesi to make common cause wi him

  why should either of them tie in with
im theyd lose by it an gain nothing
because puhoteke is a fool for ane
thing an you dinna want to for-r-get that
maist o the raids on white traders ha been
because o the thought o their stores
kaitis always wanted to get a he cud for
nothin noo weve refused him hell git
to thinkin hell take what he wants or
minea will think for him though shes
sma use for either o the brothers theres
the launch wi the american flag flauntin
at the ster-r-n

  clinton presented fresh fish for the com-
missaries of the two traders and explained
that he had been celebrating his holiday in
the sport of angling incidentally he told
of his affair with kaiti harrison guffwed
but macintosh looked grave

  the three o tis ha made him lose face
  	-

the same day he said therell be trou-
ble o sorts br-r-ewin

  let er brew said harrison i never
trouble trouble till trouble troubles me
ave a drink clinton i see your flags hup
whats the hoccasion eres to it any-
wy

  just an anniversary clinton answered
diplomatically we have lots of em
where the ignorance of his british neigh-
bors remained bliss it was sheer folly to
make them wise

  we ave one or two said harrison
one on the ninth of this month im
arskin you two over to supper - ow
about it

  macintosh supplied the question that
clinton had in mind

  what happened on the ninth of july
he asked no that im lookin askance
at a geeft supper ill be on hand

  what appened the ninth of july
hin the year nineteen undred is the date
of the colonial draft bill mykin new
south wyles victoria south haustrylia
queensland tasmania hand western haus-
trylia a commonweath thats hall

as the evening passed harrison
became first boastful then bois-
terous over his skill at pool la-
menting the fact there was no
table on which he could exhibit and then
macintosh through the spiritual medium
of mr hollands became the impersonator
of r-r-r-ober-r-r-t bur-r-r-ns

  at eleven oclock grasping the hand
alternately first of clinton and then of
harrison so as not to make a trio out of
burns immortal twa he half sang and
half declaimed

      we twa hae paidld i the bur-r-n

      f-r-r-e mor-r-ning sun till dine

      but seas between us br-raid ha r-r-r-oar-red
      sin auld lang syne

  at half past when clinton left the scot
was declaiming with fervor

o wer-re we as young as we ance hae been

  we sud hae been gallopin down on yon green
  and linking it ower the lily-whit lea

  but wer-re na my hear-r-rt light i wad dee

adventure

   aggis owll you make aggis with no
sheep on the hisland owll you get your
sheepshead demanded harrison argu-
mentatively

  macintosh surveyed him with a full mea-
sure of scorn

  a macintosh was never-r yet unable to
pr-rovide for-r his guests mon ill mak
h-hic-haggis gin i hae to use your ain heid
im thinkin theres slight differ-r-rence

  clinton made his exit

  in the launch he knew that the threat-
ened spat had been averted over the
waters came the sounds of amity however
misappropriate the words it was the senti-
ment that counted though the suggestion
of harrison running over a sidehill and pick-
ing daisies in company with macintosh
struck clinton as humorous he had had
just enough liquor to accentuate the ridicu-
lous and stimulate imagination he could
visualize the two one thin the other stout
both in kilts flitting about the daisied slope
as the song grew fainter in the distance

    we twa hae run about the br-raes
    and pud the go wans fine

    but weve wandered mony a wear-r-ry foot
    sin auld lang syne

it was late afternoon in the vil-
lage of kaiti the moist heat
was sweltering for the place was
closely hemmed in by the thick
and matted bush and little or no wind crept
into it it was practically deserted save
for the snapping snarling dogs and razor-
backed slate-colored pigs rooting in the offal
and filth with their long upturned snouts

  most of the men had spent the hot day
in the little houses they had built in their
garden clearings tabu for the women a
few of them had cleared a little bush cut
a little timber worked on a few garden
fences a few had gone hunting or fishing

  the women had labored hard tilling
planting and cultivating now they were
digging and gathering vegetables and fruit
collecting firewood beginning to drift back
to the triage in groups of two three and
four they wei all heavily burdened with
their yams their firewood and whatnot in
netted bags that hung ofl tllr backs from
loops slung over the tops of trioit heads
sometimes children were atop the load qr
carried in smaller bags shaped like ham-
mocks some rode astride their mothers
shoulders or straddled their hips

  a few men began to appear on the plat-
form of the big clubhouse with its floor
raised on high stilts from the ground a
clumsy irregular ladder of -poles leading to
a sort of porch over which the roof pole was
extended thatch-grass pendent in long
fringes from it long strips of bark cloth
painted with totem signs hanging down
the men yawned and stretched themselves
taking no notice of the women a young
buck-dandy shining with oily red paint
his black frizzy hair beautifully combed a
necklace of beads dangling bands of perfo-
rated shell on his upper arms and below the
knees into which he had tucked colored
leaves of the dracena shrub a belt of bark
tight-corseted painfully indrawn about his
empty stomach a new clout of barkcloth for
perineal band proclaimed to all the village
that he was courting a girl

  probably the girl herself saw him no
one else paid any attention to him the
men on the clubhouse balcony hunkered
scratching their hair with short sticks say-
ing nothing not noticing the women any
more than they did the grubbing pigs and
slinking dogs

  the light was fading the sun already be-
low the top tangle of the forest through the
gaps of which came shafts of hot and angry
red light now more men showed coming
in idly their toilet bags on their arms from
which they extracted betel-nut and lime a
few carried pigeons or kangaroo rats two
brought in a wild pig on a pole

  the most curious thing of all was the way
in which they came on to the scene and
moved about it exactly like extras in some
savage drama who could not be entrusted
with lines and who had been instructed only
to keep moving few words were spoken
at all few glances interchanged and yet
there was something in the atmosphere that
charged it with purpose-something out of
the ordinary sinister

  the women passed to their household
duties they cooked for the men but they
did not eat with them all the bachelors
and a great many of the married men ate
on the clubhouse platform others on the
porches of their own houses while the wo-
men and girls after the food was cooked
devoured it squatting on the ground or in-
side their homes from earthen plates and
boiling pot using shell and bamboo knives
coconut spoons prcsged forks of bone

  and every woman as siic came into the
the three traders



village as she made her fire and baked the
yams or stewed the meat turned furtive
looks toward the piles on which the club-
house was supported there was something
living under there lost in the shadows a
dark mass from which there issued the stink
of human sweat the sweat of fear as much
as of natural exudation

  there were twenty men there jammed
into a bamboo cage so that movement was
almost impossible they were packed as
close as apples in a shipment barrel wedged
in since they were seized at dawn by order
of kaiti all day the flies and the mosquitos
had stung and bitten them the dogs sniffed
and snarled at them and the heat sapped
them of vitality they had not been fed
been given no water and all the time the
hope of living had slowly leached out of
them and the growing fear of a horrible
death had gnawed at their manhood they
knew that above their heads kaiti was de-
vising the method of their passing if they
were found guilty that the wizard was at
his incantations and would smell out the
culprits at top moonheight

  there was only one among them who
should really suffer for having broken the
command of kaiti he had told his wife
what had happened between the chief and
kalinitoni the white man rather she had
got it out of him little by little sensing he
was keeping something from her so the
story had gone through the tribe like the
savor of a succulent morsel in the cooking
pots it would not stop there it would
spread through the island there would be
laughing in the villages of vetesi and puho-
teke kaiti would be mocked nothing
not even the wizard puriti could stop the
arrow of gossip any more than one might
stay a shooting star

  the guilty one kept his own counsel the
others perforce accepted their fate there
was no use talking about it some one
would be lulled perhaps all of them there
would be no more laughing and talking no
more smacking of lips over good food no
more lust or zest of life whoever the
wizard pointed out would be dispatched to
the uttermost darkness

  they were numb with pressure faint re-
laxed only the constriction of their quar-
ters kept them erect the man who had
talked still cursed the folly that had made
him yield to a womans nagging but he did
it in silence automatically as the petition

of a prayer-wheel the curse fluttering in his
shallow brain

  maybe the wizard puriti would smell him
out he was afraid of the wizard a man
who talked with the dead who did magic
things with stones who could kill a man by
merely telling him he was going to die but
he was going to hope for tie best perhaps
puriti would want to use the occasion to
kill some one else against whom he had a
grudge such things had been done for
toteo knew times when the guilty had been
passed over if only he had smashed in his
wifes head when she kept him awake with
her worrying questions-as he had been
minded to-instead of answering her

  it must not be surmised because kaiti
had a brain that could never have ranked
beyond third grade that he was a fool
such things are matters of comparison
even minea was not really smarter than he
was he let her get away with things be-
cause he was too lazy to oppose her he let
her more or less drug him with kawa because
he liked the effect of the fermented ginger-
root

  but now he was stirred from all lethargy
by a constant spur he had lost face he
was a subject of jest and he knew that the
chief who is laughed at is neither respected
or feared in the present situation he began
to see his chance to get rid of the white men
and hold supremacy of the island for him-
self he had been insulted by all three of
them and he would turn that to advantage
by the assumption that a slight upon him
was a slight upon all the tribesmen

  the first thing was to punish those who
had gossiped to devise something that
would redound to his own credit set the
tribes talking so that if the wretched inci-
dent of the damaged fish or the refused trade
goods and liquor ever came up it would be
eclipsed by the vengeance of kaiti if it
came to fighting his prestige as a warrior
made him the true leader he was fat
but he was strong he might be a great
eater but he was also a mighty fighter he
sent for puriti the wizard

  wizardry is a fine art as practised by
savage sorcerers it is a business that is
roughly divided into three branches-reli-
gion medicine and politics priesthood and
healing ever go together where men are
primitive kaiti was superstitious and it
seemed as if puriti was able to do things
with ghosts to help him but kaiti was not


adventure

much afraid of him he knew he had his
bag of tricks knew how some of them were
worked

  to have a great wizard was a great attri-
bute to an overlord and in this he outranked
his brothers who had tahunas of only medi-
ocre accomplishments puriti could dress
up his ceremonials wonderfully and he was
quick-witted but kaiti never forgot that
he and not puriti was the real ruler of the
tribe puriti was only mortal like himself
and he was not infallible minea was
cleverer in many ways though she did not
have the ancient knowledge the art of mum-
mery the apparatus handed down in the
sorcerers cult

puriti looked the part he
had a lean and hungry look and
his face was the face of a bronze
devil few ever saw him in day-
light or without his trappings when he
came in to kaiti he jangled with human
teeth and knuckle bones his body was harle-
quined with paint and save for his orna-
ments and a g string of bark cloth he was
naked

  his familiar was with him a cur that he
had dyed so that one side of it was black and
the other yellow trimming its ears and
staining its teeth as scarlet as his own with
betel-nut he had taught it all sorts of tricks
with infinite patience and he vowed that
it held the spirit of tai greatest of all
sorcerers

  it sat on its haunches beside him like a
goblin at the end of the clubhouse where a
wickerwork fetish stood a hideous fantasy
tricked out with feathers and fur with
sharks teeth and a long nose tube of wicker
that made it seem a combination of sea and
land and sky part cassowary part squid
part kangaroo which may have been the in-
tent on either side were mummies the
skins of dead men drawn over clay models
clay caricatures of their faces sculptured
over dried heads where the hair was re-
tained the eye sockets filled with scrolls of
rolled palmleaf neatly coiled hands and
feet of phalanging roots like mandrakes
between these stood racks filled with skulls

  in the ordinary course of village life
puriti was a practitioner in sickness and
witchcraft he gave love spells and he told
fortunes he discovered stolen things he
took charge of deaths which always came
from evil influences and fixed the responsi-

bilities he was ballet-master of the mystic
dances he had many neophytes of his own
and he presided over the ceremonials where-
by boys entered manhood and for all of
these things he collected his perquisites and
fees

   but where kaitis person was concerned
his safety his dignity puriti was the poli-
tician pure and simple the diplomat the
grand vizier his own interests subordinate
to those of kaiti he knew of course for
what he was wanted but he was not sure of
all that was in kaitis mind

  he had small doubt of discovering the
guilty man the actual means he would
employ were based upon detective princi-
ples he had his spies and stool pigeons and
he was depending a good deal upon minea
like the french crime investigators puriti
believed in seeking the woman in the case
he knew how to handle women they be-
lieved that he could cause them to bear male
or female children cripples or stillborn as he
pleased that he was arbiter over their souls
before life and after death that if he willed
it they might see their dead babies again
after their own death

   once he found out who was guilty or who
kaiti wanted found guilty he would go
ahead with the ceremonial with the tricks
in which he delighted while the people
gasped in awe at his wisdom and power

   kaitis face was like a thundercloud his
stomach was sour and his head ached but he
was not drinking he did not intend to
drink again until the white mens liquor was
his then-

   the two sat in silence for a while kaiti
chewing betel-nut and lime paste spitting
copiously into a calabash whose contents
would be carefully guarded and destroyed
lest some one possess himself of them and
bewitch the chief even puriti could not
prevent such a spell

  what is in your mind concerning this
matter puriti

   the wizard felt his way watching kaitis
face

   it is better to punish one or two than
to destroy twenty who are good paddlers
and fighters this comes in my mind

  the twenty all deny this thing though
they believe they will be thrown to the
sharks such was the threat of kaiti

  i have changed my mind about the
sharks i have a better thought one
would not be missed where twenty would
the three traders



it is true perhaps only the one knows who
is guilty

  the others would not tell if they knew
the fool talked with his wife all gossip
comes from the women let minea talk
with the wives of these men as i shall in-
struct her let them be brought in one at
a time she will ask them who has started
this idle talk about the king

  this was sheer flattery but kaitis eyes
gleamed and puriti lowered his own lids to
hide the light in his own kaiti meant to
use this affair for the fulfilment of his ambi-
tion it marched with puritis the greater
the might of kaiti the greater his own the
fatter his fees

  you think the women will tell

  i think that nineteen of them will give
the same name and that the twentieth will
give another-or none at all for minea will
tell them that if the truth is not told they
will all surely die they and their men
men like to live but they do not fear death
as women do they will tell or if they do
not tai will smell them out

  the goblin hound whined hearing its
name kaiti looked at it half fearfully if
tai could find out why question the women
but he did not ask that he could never
come quite to the point of testing puriti
he might be able to talk with ghosts

  so be it he said i will speak with
minea

  let her tell each woman that if she
speaks of the matter to another her tongue
will be fed to the pigs as for the woman
who gives no name or gives one different
from the rest-which she may do having
spite against some other-she is not to be
held but to go free with the rest the
drums will sound at moonrise when the
moon is over the village we will find the
ones who have flouted the kings wish

  so be it you are wise about women
puriti

  i have many wives

  so have i sometimes i think too
many

  kaiti sat glowering puriti wrapped his
lean arms about his bony knees and hugged
his thought if kaiti made away with
minea he would not mind it she was too
clever if kaitis mood was worked upon
he might smell out minea some day when
the chief was sick from overeating with-
out kaitis private sanction it would be too
risky even as kaiti the warrior was a

little afraid of puriti the thinker so the
sorcerer was a little afraid of the fighter and
hl moods of anger a mans skin was so
little a thing to hold his blood so easily
pierced so hardly mended

it grew cooler as it became
dark the cooking fires burned
low but others were appearing
many under the houses and some
on the platforms to keep at bay the mos-
quitos the tribesfolk began to sit around
these in groups still comparatively silent
compared to the usual chattering the chant-
ing of songs and the inevitable beating of
individual drums there was a good deal of
smoking sharing the smoke-filled cavity of
a bamboo pipe that was charged with coarse
native tobacco made into a cartridge with
a leaf wrapper  one sucked out the air and
let the pipe fill with fumes a little of which
he inhaled passing the tube around until
it had to be recharged

  there was expectancy in the air all
waited to see the moon show from behind
the jagged peaks to the east there was
glow there already the planet would be
high when it topped the range

  aside from the first passion of lovers the
suckling time of children the half super-
stitious regard for babes who died before
they were able to talk and walk there was
little true affection among them none that
was not completely offset by the prospect
of puritis dramatic spectacle the excite-
ment of their own participation in it the
smelling out of a victim and the spilling
of human blood friendship ceased with
clan protection in time of mutual danger
the immediate family of the victim would
mourn long and loudly but wailing was a
mechanical action that took place upon all
kinds of occasions birth marriage death

  they were all creatures of the moment
reactionaries to primitive instincts kaiti
and puriti dominated them because of their
ambitions their pride of race the fact that
their ancestors had been chiefs for many
generations and had actually lived on better
food minea too was chiefly bred

  a brush charged with silver seemed sud-
denly swept across the top of the forest with
its dense undergrowth and great half-
smothered trees the moon wheeled up re-
vealing the outlines of the houses more
plainly the circles of nearly naked crouch-
ing savages the groves of gigantic palms


adventure

about the village borders and in the central
open space

  it revealed the hard-trodden level of the
sing-sing ground where a dim fire burned
between great hollowed-log fetishes in front
of a mammoth banyan tree whose but-
tressed boughs showed cavernous with here
and there the moving glint of a torch be-
tween the columns that upheld the big
branches and sent down roots to anchor

  here were the dressing-rooms the green
room the wings of puriti and his assistants
one of these came out to a drum carved
into the semblance of an elongated face with
a tongue hanging out of the grotesque
mouth and a black bird with outstretched
wings perched upon the top of the skull
he swung a mallet against the cylinder with
all his might

  wham-m-m the sound was dull at first
close to there was a long slit a soundhole
in the log with the succeeding strokes the
high vibrations renewed by the powerful
blows before the first series had subsided
the concussions seemed to explode in mighty
booms like the firing of a big gun the
drummer seemed to warm up to attune his
instrument until it trembled sensitively
vibrant then he began to send in code

  in the village they listened to the an-
nouncement while their pulses beat in rhy-
thm so that they were creatures of the drum
without volition timed to its beats swayed
by its momentum controlled by its mes-
sages

 boom-boom-booml boom boom-
boom-boom-boom boom boom

  the savage phonetics the wild wireless
of the tribes pounded on it began with
the clan call told briefly of the nature of
the entertainment and its purpose and ex-
tended a hearty invitation to puhoteke and
vetesi it suggested that the occasion con-
cerned all of them as kaiti was minded to
have it considered he meant to have a
talk with his brothers afterwards to heat
the iron and strike while it was pliable

  the women would not come at nightfall
nor would the warriors if it had not been
moonlight for fear of evil spirits lurking in
the narrow bush trails to seize them few
of them would try to return that night and
as the island was fraternally owned and
there was no real friction between the three
divisions this could be done without danger
of a raid

  so the villages of vetesi and puhoteke

read the message and as it ended roared
back their acceptance clinton heard the
drums and so did macintosh and harrison
the two last together on harrisons veranda
all three knew it for code-sending though
none of them could read it in the light of
recent events they wondered whether or
not it should be considered ominous they
could distinguish it from the monotonous
tom-tom of the dance tympans from the
raucous bellow of the devil-devil drums that
proclaimed war

  the twenty prisoners heard it in their
cage the sweat drying on them with the
night air that was not low enough in tem-
perature to discourage black clouds of mos-
quitos that attacked them there was no
smudge fire for them overhead they could
hear the shuffling feet of their fellows who
presently would see them go through their
ordeal now their vitality was low from
the exhaustion of the pressure and lack of
food they were ready to die to welcome
any sort of delivery from the cage

  none was allowed near them their wo-
men least of all nineteen of these knowing
that they had given the true name of the
gossip were hopeful of escape from trouble
the twentieth half deceived by mineas
imperturbability made yet more dull her
childish brain by chewing a narcotic root
she went with the rest of the village to the
sing-sing ground when the moon stood over
the village palms taking a little comfort
from her seeming immunity

  to have taken her prisoner would have
belittled puritis ceremonies she did not
realize that she was watched by the nine-
teen who considered her hostage for the
safety of their own men the condition of
a widow was not a pleasant one and they
were not minded to enter upon it unneces-
sarily

  the voice of the drums changed after the
messages had been acknowledged as the
moon lifted they seemed to attain a fiercer
more insistent note droning at times and
then blaring like great organ pipes

  the villagers moved toward the sing-sing
ground men and women smeared according
to their individual fancies with red yellow
and black paint with lime mixed with pig-
fat tricked out with feathers with armlets
and anklets with necklaces and disks of
pearl distending their earlobes with strips
of bone thrust through the septa of their
flat noses
the three traders



  the men carried their spears and some of
them took skulls from their personal racks
in the clubhouse the women had peeled
wands carved and painted there was to
be a preliminary dance in which all would
join before puriti took the stage each
dressed for the part much as a boy might
deck himself with odds and ends for playing
pirates or indians this was play to the
tribesmen the killing that would come at
the end of it merely incidental unless-and
their mouths watered at this thought-un-
less the victims were uj famish their own
funeral meats and fong-pig be baked in the
ovens tb jast was doubtful no orders
had beeii given to fire the pits

  through the corridors of the bush there
came in single file vetesi and his warriors
puhoteke and his men the files converging
as they threaded the maze of trails--
melanesians all of medium stature their
skins plum-black where the paint showed
them their hair bleached fawn and ocher
ornaments jingling and twinkling under the
moon their bodies were powerful but
their faces asymmetrical primitive types

  between the root pillars of the banyan
puriti crouched knees drawn up his hands
clasped about them his costume was not
yet donned and he squatted motionless
unmindful of the thrumming of the great
tympani the people coming into the en-
closure such matters were handled by his
subordinates he waited his cue star per-
former of the evening

time had rolled back its scroll
twice ten thousand years it was
the stone age

  the moon serene that had
seen so many things smiled with its dead
face soaring high above the sing-sing
ground where the soil was beaten flat hard
as cement by generations of dancing feet
the place was walled in by the bush held
back but ever moving growing in all direc-
tions save where the tribesmen hacked and
burned it giant trees fought by strangling
vines thorny underbrush a fury of vege-
tation only the great banyan stood out
from the forest the firelight blazed high
and the shining bodies of the dancers drip-
ping with sweat from the flames and their
exertions reflected the crimson blaze and
were touched by the moon rays as with a
calcium

  the men pranced to the thunder of the

drums where kaiti sat throned on a carved
log they advanced in rushes of rnocl war
shaking their spears and shouting they
killed imaginary enemies and gloated over
them showing their heads on the lance-
points the white skulls bobbing they
formed in ft phalanx bent double knees
high as they stepped chanting exploding
in a final roar of triumph and upflung arms

  all the time the women shuffled shuffled
to the tempo leaning on the peeled wands
their faces bereft of visible emotion mere
masks of stupidity thir gaze fixed held
in the hypnosis of rhythm

  with the warriors it was different their
emotions were roused and lusts loosed lusts
of fight of murder of blood summoned by
the drums quicken that rhythm a little
and the men would wheel and rush to seize
the women quicken it yet more and they
would go wholly mad their little reason
breaking like glass vibrating at too high a
pitch

  now they were more brutes than men
manlike beasts hairless apes excited to
cruelties that jungle law would never brook

  now and then the women broke into the
chant with two whining measures given
flatly automatically then came the bass
of the men howled with full strength of their
lungs as they brandished their spears and
held their trunks curiously stiff on the pranc-
ing legs-going like pistons the bull-roar-
ing bellow of the drums the shrill note of
panpipes

  suddenly silence

  the neophytes of puriti came out masked
like birds with long cloaks of grass set in
rows like thatch on barkcloth they
cleared the enclosure before the log-fetishes
of the dancers gave instructions here and
there marshaled the women in a crescent
and made them hunker down on one side
the men on the other

  kaiti still as a statue on his long throne
his musket-scepter in his hand now leaned
forward a little and spoke briefly to vetesi
and puhoteke seated to right and left of
him his heavily jowled face was bestial
his eyes glowed in the firelight like car-
buncles

  though the pounding of the drums had
ceased the air seemed still full of humming
vibrations the women were coming slowly
out of their semi-trance among them were
the twenty who were the wives of the pad-
dlers these last were hustled on roughed


adventure

  by their escort stood up in a faltering line
  whei they stared straight forward their

    rrs twivhing striving for control over
their numbed s anything but an up-
right immobile posiu misht provoke the
 wrath of kaiti

    after the little confusion of their entrance
  silence held again that after all the ciinr
  of the drums was more impressive as it
  lasted even kaiti became uneasy he set
  down his musket and fingered nervously a
  javelin of hard wood heavy almost as iron
  the butt was carved and barbs had been
  filed at the point with pumice friction the
  tip itself was of obsidian it was a beauti-
  fully balanced thing a kings weapon and
  the polished shaft had been soaked in hot
  blood scores and scores of times

    there came a flutter of sound the swift
  patter of hands upon conjurers drums
  shaped like golf-bags of light wood hollowed
  by hand and fire funneling-in slightly from
  both ends toward the middle the mouth
  covered with lizardskin with a handle that
  was part of the main drum panpipes and
  flutes shrilled a minor strain over and over
  again weaving through the sound-fabric
  of the fluttering drums the big drums had
  left the air palpitating stirred in a mael-
  strom

   this music seemed to come from nowhere
 and from everywhere at once it mur-
 mured in the trees from ground level and
 from the high branches it made the blood
 creep and jump the eyes to strain into the
 shadows that moon and fires could not dis-
 solve black mysterious patches that looked
 as if they might be the gaping mouths of
 pits entrances to the underworld

   then in a space that had been blank a
 pulsebeat before an eerie creature appeared
 it looked a good deal like the fetish-god in
 the clubhouse come to life beyond doubt
 many thought it was there was the squat
 shape of wicker covered with cassowary
 feathers with wallaby fur topped by the
 head and the tubular snout or tentacle
 the wizards arms were bound with flexible
 wings extended as he skimmed silently
 here and there soundless to the plaint of
 the crepitating drums and the shrilling reeds

    the eyes were disks of shell fastened into
  the wicker frame of the mask the nacre
  curiously lifelike holes bored in the center
  through which puriti surveyed possible
  victims lifelike too the pliant trunk that
  seemed to be smelling out the guilty

  the figure disappeared at last between
two drum-logs to the left of kaiti and his
brothers almost immediately puriti made
entrance to the right panting a little from
the dance and the quick change for which
he had been underdressed now as when
he had talked with kaiti he was practically
naked harlequined with paint strung with
teeth of sharks and dogs and men with
knyswe-bones a girdle of old mens beards
about himiddle his face was the face of
a devil no  could have discounted
that fiendish cotmipance- he carried a
small bag of netting and dog-goblin tao
trailed behind him he stalktrf down the
line of prisoners twice his malevolent eyes
peering into theirs

  who he cried in a shrill voice who
has spread abroad slanders concerning
kaiti who has dared to lie about kaiti
all men deny it yet the words were spoken
of man

  when he paused the dog watching his
master narrowly its ears cocked consider-
ing every intonation threw up its head and
let out an ululating howl a shudder went
through the onlookers tao had spoken

  it is easy to smell out a liar went on
puriti for in his mouth is corruption
let us find this man that kaiti may decide
his punishment

  he stooped and seemed to talk to the
dog who listened and gave two barks before
he trotted to one end of the line of men
staring down at it with eyeballs that pro-
jected with slack jaws each giving a deep
sign of relief when tao after one look into
each face one back at puriti passed on

  opposite the eleventh man the dog came
to a direct halt sat down on its haunches
and uttered the long-drawn howl what
signal he may have caught from the wizard
was not noticeable

  is this the man o tao

  the howl was repeated

  so tikipo what have you to say in the
matter

  tikipo knew that no word of his could
avert his doom he read that in the sneer-
ing eyes of puriti

  i have spoken no lies about kaiti he
said stoutly

  puriti grinned at him tikipo was to
die for telling the truth but that was not to
be acknowledged

  the dog dislikes me said tikipo he
stole meat from my house and not knowing
the three traders



it was puritis dog i threw burning wood at
him

  is that true o tao asked puriti
solemnly and all the audience looked at the
fantastic hound which turned its back on
tikipo and yawning walked away there
were nervous laughs at this yet none
doubted that tao lived again in the dog

  so we will make another trial said
the wizard

  he passed to each man round objects
that he took from his bag passing swiftly
along the file dropping one after another
into their outstretched palms

  they were tuti nuts candlenuts almost
as hard as ivory but they had been painted
red and the twenty paddlers were under his
spell the spell of their own position from
which they were not yet definitely delivered
for it was likely as not to their thinking
that kaiti would order them all killed and
eats they listened and obeyed as men

do in hyjssi 

  let us see howsftong you are said the
mocking voice of the	uie wo is

guilty will not be able to crqsl h-the holds
in his hand for his spirit is alreaaj made
weak by the spirit of tao which has spc
hold out your hands at arms length
squeeze

ihrtif j could see and kaiti could
fpfl see with his brothers and those
jml closest could also see the sudden
ryv it strenuous efforts that made the
muscles swell in the forearms of the pad-
dlers muscles made big and stronger than
the ordinary by their calling beads of
sweat wrung hardly from those over-
wrought bodies stood out on their faces as
they strove to crush the nuts strove and
turned gray with despair

  one mans eyes lighted for a moment
tikipo the thing had crumpled in his
palm its contents suddenly oozed out be-
tween his fingers and puriti laughed while
tikipo looked with dismay at the white
stuff with which the wizard had filled the
nut he had palmed off on tikipo after he had
extracted its contents and before he cement-
ed the edges of the shell again there were
no other nuts so filled he laughed again
and the dog barked and tikipo knew he was
trapped

  lo said puriti the liar strove the
hardest as i knew he would and his guilt
is plain

  he caught tikipos arm and thrust it up
wards with the white mess smeared all over
his palm a great exhalation went up from
the crowd

  take him said puriti and hold him
before the chief

  he did not call kaiti king before his
brothers he guessed what was afoot the
destruction of the white men and he was
glad for once arisoni had laughed at him
and makinatosi had ordered him off the
place one time when he found him talking
with his laborers kalinitoni was the chief
offender against kaiti

  now said puriti tao has told me
that the wife of this man has gossiped-
therefore is she the more guilty since
tikipo spoke but to her and it was she who
has spread the lies let tao speak to us
he called to the dog with some quick
gesture that made it stand up on its hind
legs man wise proof of the metempsychosis
to all present

  speak tao demanded the wizard
was it tutila who spread these lies

  the woman named wife of one of the
paddlers gasped the dog sat back on its
haunches forepaws hanging but made no
sjujd one after another puriti named
the	until he came to the name of

tikipos woior the dog howled and
leaped into the air puriti called it cover-
ed its muzzle for a moment with his palm
in which was a scrap of the	s mti-

mate garment taken from her house

  go-smell her out he ordered and tht
brute raced towards the shrinking women
snuffing at them as they cowered barking at
last in front of matiti wife of tikipo

  the ordeal was ended the punishment
about to begin both were taken before
kaiti who rose from his seat his javelin in
his hand he gave a brusk command and
the men held tikipo and the woman
matiti while another forced open their jaws
with a hardwood wedge and still another
cut out their tongues and flung the reeking
morsels to tao who leaped and caught them
in midair bolting them avidly

  so is tao fed upon the tongues of those
who speak falsely said puriti

  now the man maimed and tottering was
left standing alone there was a sound of
indrawn breath a craning a sigh of satisfied
brutality as kaiti drew back his arm the
javelin poised in his clutch and then with
all the force of his mighty arm hurled it


adventure

  eyah

  it was a mighty stroke the smooth tip
entered the barb set backwards bit into
the flesh as the shaft passed on-through-
and the spear fell clear to the ground be-
yond the toppling body of the paddler

  then-a thing happened that only the mind
of a fiend could have conceived a stout
length of wood was brought two feet long
tapering like a marlinspike a long lanyard of
sennit reeved through an eye in the thick
end the womans wrist was bound to the
lanyard and the spike was thrust through the
wound made by the spear enlarging it to
a passage through which matitis left arm
was hauled emerging smeared with the
smoking gore of her mate who still breathed
crimson froth filling his tongueless mouth
her wrists were lashed together the living
embraced the dying

  set them on the platform of their house
said kaiti and let the house be tabu

         it was the evening of the ninth
of july the anniversary of the
dating of the colonial draft bill
the inception of the common-
wealth of australia macintosh and clin-
ton were the guests of harrison so far tjje
affair had not been a success tliere were
many reasons for that	

  the night was hot muggy exhausting
the land wind had failed to materialize at
sunset the barometer was jumpy and the
air surcharged with electric fluid it
crackled in their hair in the frizzy mops of
the houseboys it upset their physical
equilibrium and emphasized the uneasy feel-
ing of danger that was shared by all of
them engendered by four practically sleep-
less nights

  for four nights the great drums had
boomed up in the bush not dance-drums
nor code-drums but deep bellowings of the
biggest logs the devil-devil drums that
meant mischief nor had these waited for
moonrise but had throbbed from first
darkness until an hour or so before dawn
they meant dances indeed but only those
calculated to work up tribesmen into a
frenzy of bloodlust they meant propitiatory
sacrifices and blood-rites before the war-
idols and the evil spirits so that warriors
might adventure at nightfall and know the
demons were on their side lulled by the
prospect of later votive offerings

  vetesi had sent a messenger to harrison

warning him of the threat of kaiti to wipe
out the white men he had said that kaiti
had wanted him to join in the raid but that
he had refused because he was friendly to
harrison and also-though he did not
specify this-because tuni his wife had
advised him against this thing

  moreover puhoteke had come in person
to macintosh and in veiled but meaning
talk had said much the same thing the
canny scot had sent him away with gifts
clinton had not been warned so far har-
rison and macintosh had not brought up
the subject

  racial traits held them back from being
the first to show alarm but the thing
brooded since twilight all of them had
listened for the drums and silence had not
been reassuring

  the dinner had been almost spoiled by
the frightened cook there was no chant-
ing from the quarters where the boys oi all
three were gathered clinton joad only a
few helpers-divers and cleaners of shell-
and he had brought all of them along
macintosh had fetched a boatload and the
rest had come over of their own accord in
caaes proof of their fearfulness

  harrison was pretty well ginned-up
when his guests arrived and he had proffered
drinks freely and hospitably ever since
there was a bottle for each man and a
houseboy brought young coconuts as they
were needed clintons bottle was barely
touched macintosh indulged sparingly-
for him-and the host himself drank inter-
mittently and gloomily there was no ice
the coconuts were none too cool the stimu-
lation from each swallow of liquor brought a
reaction that was too much like a swift
touch of fever to be pleasant and induced
perspiration which was copious enough
without urge their whites were patched
with sweat

  after the meal out on the broad veranda
macintosh and harrison peeled coats and
shirts to their singlets and lay back in long
deck-chairs smoking drowsy for a while
after the heavy food and the toasts they had
drunk clinton was touched with the same
sleepiness of digestion but something
warned him of the necessity of keeping
awake he had taken off his coat before
dinner somehow or other the decidedly
undress costume of the others annoyed him
unreasonably

  macintosh long and skinny scratched
the three traders



himself harrison with his singlet open
showed a hairy chest with bright blue silk
suspenders that he called braces em-
broidered in wild roses tugged at his mus-
tache some girl had worked them for him
he had told them more than once clinton
believed that a falsehood that harrison
had bought them for himself blue-baby-
blue and pink roses-for harrison the
sight of them irritated clinton almost be-
yond control and he refilled his pipe trying
to soothe his nerves he had never known
he possessed any but now they were jumpy
tobacco lacked solace it burned his tongue
the pipe was foul the best thing was to
clear out go home but that would be de-
liberately rude and even if he didnt like
harrison he had accepted his invitation
besides-

  he caught himself listening for the drums
there was only the sound of the surf crash-
ing on the reef muffled by the heavy air it
was the rotten weather that put them all
out of sorts

  the veranda was screened against mos-
quitos but careless houseboys holding doors
open had allowed in some of the pests and
there were a lot of fat green houseflies who
made persistent sallies buzzing and biting
harrison slapping at one began to tell
again for the fiftieth time the story of his
winning of the pool championship with in-
finite details

  so i chalked my cue an took my time
about it

  macintosh lay with his eyes looking up
at the porch ceiling motionless as if har-
risons windy yarn was a lullaby clinton
watched a hairy fat fly swing down and
light in the middle of a sticky flypaper
where several of his fellows had already
given up the struggle against the stuff that
held them fast in its viscid leashes wings
legs bodies the fly had been bothering
him and he saw its doom with a grim satis-
faction he imagined harrison in some
such mess and his sense of humor returned
at the imaginary picture chasing away his
grievances much of his irritation he
grinned and harrison coming to the end of
his story took it for friendly endorsement
and grinned back

  reglar scorcher aint it brewin up
for something or other im betting eh

mac - its ot too ot to play

cards too ot to run the bloomin phony-
graph too ot to drink

  he swatted viciously at a fly and missed
it bawled for a houseboy

  you bring more those paper-catchum-
fly he ordered savvy plenty bring
the boy went away harrison laughing as
he disappeared

  i-he savvies all right you know

what-fools they are first day i broke

em out of stock the flies ad been drivin me
balmy i ad im lay em out e got all
stuck up with em both ands e tried
to git one orf with is teeth an it got glued
to is map came out to me failin over
everything thought e was bewitched for
fair theyre the only things thatll keep
the flies down yankee invention too
clinton give you credit you cant
chase the beggars out come up through the
cracks in the floor i wouldnt wonder
got many of them asked clinton

had some at my place

  you can ive got plenty ordered a

dozen an some -fool clerk sent me a

gross charged me for em too personal
account if it ad been anything i wanted
special ed ave left it out altogether
clinton noticed the houseboy as he
brought back the package of fly papers and
unpeeled two of them his skin usually
sooty black had lightened beyond imagina-
tion it was actually gray the pigmentary
cells had undergone some actual change
like a chameleons it stood for fear of
what a storm-or the drums-kaiti

  clinton did not have much respect for
kaiti but he realised that unintentionally
he had made him lose face had offended
him more than mac or his host kaiti and
his tribesmen could make things very un-
pleasant to say the least of it the three of
them with their guns might hold off a rush
kill enough of them to turn it into a retreat
but an attack en masse would be no joke
the commonwealth of australia might own
the island but kaiti did not know that the
three whites were after all only there on
tolerance through friendship with the na-
tives plus the natives fear of the white
mans superiority-his guns the quality of
his mana his spirit

  they couldnt fight the whole island
fighting at all would mean atdeast the halt-
ing of business one could not for instance
dive for shell and rot it out along a beach
that backed up to an impenetrable wall of
jungle used as an ambush by the tribesmen


adventure

who alone knew the secrets of the trails

  brains must fix up the trouble if he had
got them into it it was up to him to get them
out to use his wits idly he watched the
fat fly giving up the struggle as harrison
jawed on

  a chap told me the flies in the trenches
was orful orrible worse than bullets e
said way e told it you cud fairly see it
buzzin day an night so they wished
winter ud come back spoilin the grub
buzzin in the dugouts so you cudnt sleep
stingin an drawin blood bold as orn-
ets lightin on the dead men before they
were cold clouds of em ummin an
feedin layin eggs

 there it was the war again and
neither of them had been in it clinton
had and he wanted no second-hand de-
scriptions besides he knew what that
topic of conversation would lead to har-
rison would boast of the australians and
their prowess and mac would brag of the
doings of the ladies out of hell fair
enough if it didnt lead up to disparage-
ment of the americans the inevitable in-
troduction of the phrase too proud to
fight the suggestion that america had
carpet-bagged the misfortunes of europe
prospered on the spoils of war

  clinton felt he couldnt stand anything of
this sort tonight sooner or later mac al-
ways got sarcastic about prohibition and
profiteering there was a lot of it that
rankled under clintons hide he resented
criticism from outsiders he knew the
two regarded him more or less as an inter-
loper that if he had been after copra in-
stead of pearl shell their friendship such
as it was would be turned to open en-
mity

  they figured him as an intruder upon
british territory though they had never
actually said so but after all he was ex-
ploiting the shell that an australian partner
had uncovered pearls and pearl shell
were like gold-where you found them
nothing to do with national boundaries

  but he wasnt going to get into a row
no sense in that only it was a farce the
three of them pretending to like each
others company it was just the inevitable
chumming of white men in the savage
islands

  if it adnt been for wilson and is four-
teen points said harrison wed ave
chased the-krauts clean to berlin as

it is they dont know theyre licked why

  clinton fought down the emotion that
urged him to slap harrisons face to
challenge him to a fight to lick the stuffing
out of him it wasnt just wilson they

were running down america again and-

  boo-oo-oool boo-oo-ooo boo-o-o-o-oo

         the night was instantly hideous
with the discordant mocking
 blare that seemed to rip the hot
 air apart to penetrate their skulls
and strike their very brains with harsh
notes like hammers it was more than just
sound somehow there was a savage com-
pelling challenge there that stripped the
peel of civilization from them and made
them primitive hairy naked men with
stone axes in their fists standing on the
brink of a windblown cliff where their
women and children were lodged in caves
waiting for the assault of their tribal ene-
mies who so insolently announced their
coming the three white men looked at
each other clear-eyed linked in the emer-
gency that was going to be thrust upon
them blood-brothers in peril

  conch shells said macintosh theyll
no use those if they dinna mean business
t is kaiti two hundred warriors back of
him twa to one against his cornin here
first im thinkin hell be visitin you
clinton maist likely

  theyll not find much i buried my
shell yesterday and most of my stores
i had a hunch something might come off
when those drums started five nights ago
my men felt the same way and theyve had
experience in these islands theyre good
men-come from the tuamotus-theyll
fight

  thats more than some of my lot  do
said harrison theyll funk it so will
macs outfit scared stiff already that
beggar puriti kaitis wizard as got them
goin they know this bush crowd are
cannibals an the idea of bein stuffed an
baked in the ovens dont appeal to em
you say youve buried your stuff clinton
just the same theyll burn your shacks
ear them conches go again theyre way
up the mountain yet you say so an well
go over to your place an give em a and-
some reception when they show what
price that mac

  macintosh nodded and got up
the three traders



  well hae to teach them a lesson he
said micht as weel do it there as here
clinton shook his head they meant it
gin-drinking harrison and canny macin-
tosh stood ready to take the chance of leav-
ing their own places unprotected to save his
shacks he warmed suddenly to them

  good men he said but i havent got
much to lose if they came here to
macs place and found it unprotected theyd
burn up your groves as well as loot the stores
coco-palms take seven years to get to bear-
ing you can build a new shack overnight
they wont get my shell i buried it after
dark below tide-reach nothing to show
the place

  you are the nearest to me harrison
theyll come on here next its my fault
i pulled a grandstand stunt on kaiti and a
worse one when i offered him that damaged
fish ignorance of law and customs is no
excuse wherever you may be ive got you
into this and i wish i could get you out
its not going to do any good to fight the
way i look at it you cant kill them all
off and youre bound to leave them sore if
you win the scrap if you lose theres no
argument i dont begin to know as much
about islanders as you fellows of course

  he turned to macintosh the scot nod-
ded again

  yere largely richt we got kaiti sore
by refusin him what he asked for but hed
ha got ower that mebbe hed ha got
ower your offerin him the feesh an
takin back the shell-hook but im no sure
ye ken he lost face ont an o his men
talked aboot it tae his wife an she spread
the gossip i got this frae puhoteke

kaiti an that-puriti wi his headwife

minea whos the worst o the three killed
the man an his wife just hoo puhoteke
wouldna say but yell ken it was no a
quick death then he tries to get puhoteke
an vetesi to join wi him in killin us three
an loootin our stores

  just why they wouldna join him ill no
pretend to elucidate but ill guess at it
island politics kaiti wants to be king
as it is vetesi an puhoteki ha an equal
share wiout doubt they ken his inten-
tions in fact im sure they do forby
ive talked wi them about it an so has
harrison

  the australian assented

  tuni thats vetesis top wife told me
  so if they wad help kaiti to get rid

o harrison an mysel who are friendly wi
puhoteke an vetesi it wad be that much
easier for kaiti to get rid o his brithers
later on they can see that so can their
wives but yell tak note that whiles they
said they were not wi kaiti and warned
us there micht be trouble they didna say
they would tak sides wi us against kaiti

  if we shud kill kaiti or any number o
his men i hae my doots an verra strong
anes whether the friendship o vetesi an
puhoteke wad be able to protect us from
raids even if they wanted tae ye ken the
whole isles related an bluids thicker n
water

  es right said harrison you never
can tell when theyll round on you thats
the whole istory of the islands you can
pal up with a chief for a year or two an all
of a sudden something  appen that ell
blame on you-or is wizard will-an then
if you dont step lively theres another
prize ead in the clubhouse mine ud make
a fine exhibit on account of my gold teeth

  ive seen puriti lookin at them a
dozen times ed like to string em round
is neck e would macs right lick
kaiti an youd ave to lick the lot of em
sooner or later a row now  spill the
beans if theres any killin to amount to
anything and i reckon there will be be-
fore the nights over just the samey you
cant knuckle under to kaiti an and im
everything e asks for on a gold plate

  i didnt think it wad materialize as soon
as it has said macintosh usually
theyll beat drums for twa weeks but those
conches mean business they blaw them
to keep the kelpies an demons off the trails
we meant to warn ye tonight clinton
we talked it ower an decided wed ask ye to
stay wi ane o us till the things worked
oot as it is theyve happened to catch
the three o us in ane place thanks to har-
rison an the ninth o july its here
theyll be cornin next but theyll no be
here for a few hoors well ha time to pre-
pare for them i brought plenty of am-
muneetion wi me in case we might need it
weve guns enough an if harrisons got
any dynamite we can fix up some short-
fuse bombs an mak it verra interestin
verra interestin indeed

  ill get the dynamite an well overaul
the guns said harrison what about
the boys mac clinton you say yours
can fight ow about shooting if they


adventure

cant aim a gun its no use chuckin away
ammunition we may need it all before
were through this time an the next

  well bring the boys in said macin-
tosh theyd slaughter them i the quart-
ers but id na bring them richt awa
twil just scare them the more well hear
them cornin they be booin wi the con-
ches frichtenin the bush demons an hopin
to frichten us at the same time

  there was a flicker of lightning a ragged
levin of fire that licked about the ramparts
of a great mass of cloud it partly revealed
out of whose bulk came a low muttering of
thunder

  if the storm comes i time it may stop
the raid  said macintosh but thatll
hae to come sooner or later thered be na
sense in tryin to deal wi kaiti hed just
think we were afraid o him

  they went into consultation of war
harrisons house was two storied built
against the slope of the mountain one big
room on the ground floor with a porch out-
side unscreened which was the floor for
the veranda above on the second floor
the earth had been excavated for founda-
tions and there were several rooms

  stairs from the upper veranda practically
a living-room led down at either end to a
flat terrace and garden the rooms were
well shuttered

  assault would in all probability be made
simultaneously from below where the porch
roof that was also the veranda roof would
shelter attackers from a downfire of the
white mens weapons and up the two
flights of outside steps they would sound
their conches until they gathered in the palm
grove and then they would come with a
rush that would have to be stopped dyna-
mite at too close quarters would wreck the
house but they had to chance that there
was the danger of fire and buckets were
filled against that risk which macintosh
did not seem to think much of

  its us theyll be wantin  he said wi
oor bodies as pairfect as possible gin
they get us theyll mak a feast o us they
conseeder the hear-r-rt o a white man a
verra str-r-rengthenin thing to say naught
o other selective por-r-rtions o his anatomy
an theres oor heids for their mur-r-ral
decor-r-ations harrisons bonny teeth
theyll na want to r-reesk spoilin thejr
spoils wi fire

  he spoke with a grim sort of jesting

the excitement of the situation had affected
the burring of his rs just as liquor did
but clintons viewpoint of these two sud-
denly clarified he had been irritated with
them all evening had always despised them
a little when they talked of the war in which
they had been non-combatants now he
knew that they must have been out of it
for no will of their own soon they were
to face a savage horde of maneaters with
such tremendous odds that it did not seem
possible they could win through much
of the affair could be blamed to him and
they made nothing of it as they discussed
the best defense and coolly went about
preparations

  he was well aware that he was an out-
sider so far as puhoteke and macintosh
vetesi and harrison were concerned neith-
er of the chiefs cared anything about him
had anything to do with him he was out
of their jurisdiction and they had had no
dealing together they did not consider
him any protection against kaitis schemes
for their downfall they might be well
contented enough to let him be killed and
looted and he saw that kaiti would recog-
nize this would know why his brothers had
not joined in with him

  it was not impossible to imagine a peace
made with kaiti in which clinton would be
the scapegoat these two white men
saxon and celt of his own race would never
consider such a contingent he was one
of them and they held no rancor because
he had been the primary cause of kaitis
declaration of war told by the conches they
no longer heard doubtless the raiders had
gone to his place where as he had said they
could do no damage that could not be re-
placed with comparative ease

  the lightning was now showing more
frequently but the glares like the great
wall of cloud they revealed seemed still far
off without much strength of illumination
on the island and there was no wind
might not be any until after the thunder
storm had broken then perhaps with
rain a gale might relieve the sweltering
conditions

  harrison came from downstairs a few
sticks of low explosive in his hands a dis-
gusted look on his face

  i was afraid i was low he said i
ordered enough to come this larst trip
told em i wanted it special for planting an
widenin up the reef gap do they send
the three traders



it they dont send me a gross of --
packets of flypaper but no dynamite five
sticks of low grade is all weve got

  he cut the greasy rolls in half short-
fused them capped them split the fuses
and inserted matchheads there were car-
tridges on the table and now they over-
hauled their rifles

  three of the tuamotu divers were fair
shots and they planned to bring them on
the veranda if possible the rush must be
stopped before they made the head of the
steps or battered in the door below there
was only a limit to the time in which they
could fire and an empty gun was an in-
different weapon against the clubs wielded
by savages the gravity of the situation
was not to be underestimated

  a houseboy came in with his face twitch-
ing with the news he brought a crimson
flare in the sky to the south that they could
not see from the veranda clintons shacks
burning what trade he had left unhidden
being looted

  it means theyre just that many miles
away he said with a shrug cant get
here for three hours anyway

  but theyll come said macintosh
the nichts young yet

it was not a pleasant vigil after
all had been done that seemed
necessary the news of the fire
had spread to the quarters and
the men were brought into the protection
of the house outside they could put up
but a feeble defense against the blood-mad
bushmen fresh from the firing and loot of
clintons place wild with finding them-
selves balked of murder the white men
must protect them except for the last
assault the last desperate rally that might
be staged the odds were not a thing to
be discussed even thought about

  harrison ordered more gin brought in
but macintosh refused

  ive been drunk a few times i my life
he said but should i gang oot this trip ill
prefer to go sober youll shoot better for
not takin too much henry

  you may be right duncan my lad but
if we pull through im going on one-or-
ful bender ow about you jim or will
you ave a little snifter now whats the
idea of bein so serious

  i was wondering said clinton if
there was no other way out of this but shoot-

ing and bloodshed at the best well only
turn em back and- in the long run well be
lucky to get away to sea and leave your
plantations

  looks like it admitted macintosh
what would ye suggest you come from
a nation o inventors yeve edison an
for-rd necessity is the mither o inven-
tion they say yankee jim noos the time
to prove american genius

  it was not said sneeringly there were
no sneers between them now but a common
understanding welded on the forge of
trouble

  clinton sat smoking idly watching a fly
that had lighted on the border of the sticky
paper five feet were clear the sixth had
got caught in the viscous stuff with which
the paper was smeared it tugged and
buzzed but the sticky mess held it too
firmly at last it lifted a foreleg in the
effort lost balance set the foot down beside
the other tried to free that fell over enough
to entangle a gauzy wing

  they were pretty well trapped them-
selves he reflected the only sure safety
would be in flight abandoning everything
none of them was of the stuff to do that
lightly and there was no wind for har-
risons schooner the floodtide was run-
ning they could not get away if they
wanted to the fly collapsed held more
securely than in a spiders web its strug-
gles had only sealed its fate

  there is ane way ye micht get the best o
kaiti said macintosh and only ane
and i dinna see a chance o accomplishin
that aside frae oor refusin him what he
asked-and its no the first time hes been
refused for every time ye gie him aught he
wants more-the trouble has come aboot
because jim clinton made him lose face i
front o his paddlers

  now if something could be done to him
in front o his whole tribe or more o them
than he could punish ye ken something
that would mak him rideeculous why that
ud settle it laugh at a leader an hes a
leader no langer if it could be fixed to in-
clude puriti wed have no more tr-rouble
wi kaiti or his outfit puhoteke an
vetsi get alang well enough wi each other
and us aye i kaiti could be laughed oot
o court so to speak

  as it is the bloomin jokes on us said
harrison 

  im not so sure ive got an idea said
o

adventure

clinton i think it  work if it doesnt
were no worse off than before its bound
to have some effect if the storm doesnt
break if the storm does come hard enough
it may stop the raid anyway as mac says
but well try this dodge listen

  they listened half incredulous at first
then with increasing attention finally
mac slapped his bony knee and harrison
guffawed out loud

  jim yere a yankee genius said the
scot yevegotaguidheidonye

  the sound of conchs booed faintly in the
distdiic

  well ave to urry said harrison i
think the storm  ang over for a bit ow
 we tackle it jim

  you take one flight of steps and mac
the other while i get to work downstairs
lets go

they turned out all the lights
as the conchs came closer then
ceased and sat in the darkness
their weapons set handy know-
ing the tribesmen were gathering in the
coconut groves getting ready for a
rush the heavy cloud wall had come in
closer as the intermittent lightning showed
thunder muttered and growled but the
mass of vapor seemed a barrier holding
back the storm that presently must break
through

  the heat was terrific but they did not
mind it it conduced to the efficiency of
clintons scheme to make a laughing stock
of kaiti and turn his attack into failure

  it was a nerve-tingling job waiting for
the assault to materialize it seemed for a
while as if the attack must have been
abandoned and all the time the lightning
flared faster and more vividly the thunder
sounded like great guns battering at the
black citadel a moaning sound seemed
mingled with the pounding of the reef but
there was no wind

  breath was hard to manage as if they
had been in a vacuum every little while
the trembling lightning flashes would wink-
ingly reveal the scene weirdly tinted as if
they gazed at it through purple glass or as
if it was a stage setting under purple cal-
ciums the weird light held just long
enough for the eyes barely to adjust them-
selves and begin to take in details before all
was black again impenetrable

  harrison was the first to see them break-

ing out from the palms just as a flash came

  ere they come he whispered if
your scheme dont work jim weve got to
stop em before they get to the ead of the
stairs

  it  work better take stations

  clinton was suddenly confident cool cer-
tain of his plan the next flash showed
the savages running towards the house
bounding along their painted faces fiendish
in the brief glare their weapons shaken as
from brazen throats there suddenly issued
a blood curdling yell calculated to stop the
very heartbeats of the men they supposed
were sleeping unawares

  kaiti was at the head of one bunch that
made for the right hand stairway puriti
led for the left others rushed for the space
below the veranda they bore with them
logs for battering rams

  kaiti leaped for the steps his men close
behind him his feet landed in something
that slid slickly under him that clung to
his soles he lost his balance fell asprawl
his followers in a momentary confusion that
rapidly increased to panic kaitis hands
were glued now to squares of stuff that he
could not shake off there was one of them
on his face dinging there flapping a little as
if alive persistent as a vampire bat more
on the side of his body where he had slipped
he pawed to get rid of them and accumu-
lated more it was some white mans
magic

  all about him his men were struggling
sliding shouting in alarm at this silent at-
tack that had materialised with such ap-
palling swiftness their weapons were thick
with the glue their fingers stuck together
it was in their hair their eyes clinging
hampering blinding

  on the other stairs the same calamity had
come to pass under the veranda men
squirmed in confusion catching at each
other dropping the battering logs patched
all over their arms when they sought to re-
trieve them pulling each other down mad
with the knowledge that some frightful
sorcery had laid hands upon them

  a livid gash of flame appeared in the very
center of the storm cloud that now seemed
just beyond the reef a shattering blast of
thunder seemed to pour through the gap
with a sulfurous taint on the wind that
rushed into and passed the breach simul-
taneously came the roar of broken vapor-
vacuums a second fierce glare of levin as
the three traders



the gale leaped to the land bowing the
palms and rushing up the mountain

  it did more than that in the glow of
the lightning it set all the loose ends of the
flypapers fluttering where they were not
cemented to the bodies of kaiti puriti and
all the warriors now changed into frightened
children what few wits they had utterly
flown knowing only they were bewitched by
these things that had suddenly flown at
them magic things that were sapping them
of all the strength and courage

  they were bewitched puriti with the
rest and kaiti doubtless there was
poison in the glue

 they bolted headlong men fell and
were trampled upon scaled with the awful
things rolled in them wherever one man
clutched at another or strove to beat off
these demons-surely they were demons-
they found themselves in greater dis-
tress

  again the lightning came and the thunder
crashed and the wind blew fluttering the
papers the terrible gods of the white men
had risen in their wrath puriti and kaiti
led the flight if it could be dignified by such
a name towards the grove flypapers stick-
ing to every part of their anatomy while
their men came flopping and flapping and
floundering behind them

  the three traders stood in their grand-
stand shaken with laughter as the electric
fluid flamed and showed the ignominious
defeat and flight they rocked with mirth
and were powerless if weapons had been
needed they could not have used them
clinton had a fleeting idea to fire a volley
above their heads and then realized it was
far better as it was

  there had been no personal sign from the
white men at all only the enveloping fly-
papers strewn thickly on the steps and under
the porch thanks to the gross of packages
shipped in error then the timely bursting
of the storm the coming of the wind all
supernatural all plainly the work of the
gods

there was no laughter in
kaitis broken ranks but when
they reached the village the spec-
tacle they would present at day-
break would be sufficiently ludicrous the
women would have to scrape off the sticky
mixture and all that had adhered to it it
would take days to get it out of their hair

kaiti nor puriti could never reinvest them-
selves with dignity they were utterly
finished

  now the rain came crashing down flood-
ing the trails up which the crestfallen
tribesmen made their way amid the fury of
the storm that thrashed the great boughs of
the forest and broke them off and flung them
at the miserable creatures that crawled like
ants in a flood discredited defeated

  the rain clattered on the roof of harri-
sons house but the three traders did not
heed it

  as dawn slowly sifted in through the
slanting lines of rain they stood in a triangle
with arms folded the right hand of clinton
clasping the left hand of harrison and his
left the right of macintosh who were
similarly interlinked in mystic fashion that
the houseboys staring through the doors
knew for magic ritual

  they saw the white men lift their folded
arms together then lower them with a sud-
den jerk to the rhythm of the strange chant
they sung in words that beach english did
not furnish surely it was a great charm
that they practised what a fool puriti
had been kaiti had been to think they
could prevail against wizards like these

  now said macintosh ance more and
a together-r-r

      should auld acquaintance be for-r-got

       an never-r br-rought to min

       well tak a cup o kindness yet
       for the days o auld lang syne

  ye ken he said when the charm was
ended and he filled the glasses im the
auldest o the three o us which gies me the
richt to speak fir-r-st lang syne oor fore-
bear-r-rs were a leevin on the same bonny
isle forebye theres par-r-ts o it far-r
super-rior-r to ithers but let that gang
were o ane kin yet lets dreenk to the
race

  they drank

         inky buck cadgers voice
         rose in a roar dinky

dick farrell rechristened

 dinky by the foreman came

hurriedly from the kitchen he wiped his
hands nervously on his apron cadger
leaned back from the slab table to glare at
him the half dozen men of the crew
gathered at leisurely sunday breakfast
grinned

  what the-kinda flapjacks do you

call them

  cadger poked at the pile of cakes on his
plate under his huge thumb the skin of
the top one scuffed showing the sticky bat-
ter beneath the cook answered with just
a flash of spirit

  well you couldnt wait you kept
riding me to hurry

  cadger threw the cakes into his face
they struck with a slushing sound and left
a streak of batter along his jaw young
farrell recoiled a step or two his fists
doubled

  the foreman pushed back his chair
dont you like it he asked with a
mean grin you can settle it you know in
a holy minute outside or inside well
dicks eyes wavered from the pale blue
orbs of the muscle-ridged foreman they
were fierce and pig-little he could not
meet them long his look traveled about
the walls of the log house and dropped to
the floor his fists loosed themselves

afraid hey jeered cadger trouble
with you is dinky youre yellah if you

was a man youd a fought long ago or
got out

young farrell winced at the words 
you dont like to think of gettin out
hey went on his burly tormentor well

when you came here beggin for a job
looked as if you hadnt eat for a month

  goin to stand there all day his
voice changed to a terrifying bellow go
cook me some cakes and if they aint done
you take that lickin anyway

  dick shuffled to the kitchen

  the foreman glared about the table
some kept their eyes on their plates the
others gave him truckling grins they
knew and feared his unreasonable anger

  sloppiest cook i ever seen he snarled
if i could find a better one id cuff this
thing into the lake

  they ate in silence until dick came back
with the platter cadger pulled one of the
cakes apart and looked at the smoking
edges he grunted as much in disappoint-
ment as in approval and dumped three-
fourths of the stack on his plate then he
poured on hot bacon grease and molasses
the man at his left first making sure the
czar required no more took the rest

  breakfast finished the gang getting out

  with a wicked oath cadger hurled him-
self at webb his fist came over in a round-
house swing and the other went down on his
back his head in a corner he struggled
and sat up his mouth cut and bleeding

  youre a swell nurse you big fat lazy
slob roared cadger nuthin to do but
watch a crazy man and you let him get
away from you whered he go

  i told you i dont know the fright-
ened webb wiped his mouth with the palm
of his hand i heard him about daylight
but he didnt make much noise and i
dropped off to sleep again

  youre always sleepin

  i supposed he was all right hes been
wild to get out these four-five days but its
been so cloudy he hates the dark i
guess he was tickled it was fair you know
the only word he can say is sun

  come on with it

  well when he saw the sun i guess
he just dressed himself and went to be out
in it

  cadger wheeled to the table

  what you sittin around like a lot o
dummies for he demanded tumble out
and get to lookin he aint got no more
mind than a baby if we dont find him
hes through were on the edge of forty
miles o bad lands hitch up the horses

flivver

to go

  the question came from the cook stand-
ing in the doorway of the kitchen a plate
and wiping cloth in his hands

  sa-ay the foreman stepped threaten-
ingly in his direction ask fool questions
will yuh have i got to stop and knock yer
teeth out

  it isnt a fool question the slender dick
answered placatingly but we dont
know which way he went he could get an
awful start in two hours let me call cen-

tral and spread the word maybe some-
body has seen him

  he turned to the telephone screwed to the
logs beside the window and turned the
crank

  oh hello he said soon is that you
carrie  say carrie this is dick farrell

garland the lumberman is lost anyway
we think he is yes he left his shack a
couple of hours ago what wandered

he stood by the phone the receiver at
his ear

telephonin to do ill do it you get gay
and ill sock yuh one yet get busy

  this last he roared at his men and they
hurried out webb returned to the gar-
land cabin a few yards away patting his
injured mouth with a handkerchief

  hello dick resumed yes carrie

pretty early this morning uh-huh got
a drink of water prouty didnt see which
way he went thank you dont you be-
lieve we better call the sheriff and rout out
the settlers thats fine carrie thanks
a lot well go right ovr to hanks

  as the cook turned from the telephone
buck cadgers hands closed on his throat
the foreman squeezed cruelly until the
younger mans breath died in his windpipe
as tall as cadger he lacked weight and
muscle and he struggled uselessly just
this side of suffocation cadger flung him
against the wall

  once and for all gritted the venemous
foreman am i boss or aint i you keep
yer lip out o this or ill just about kill yuh

jjpgsp buck cadger rode to the foot
three sisters ridge in the
ny camp errand car the other
	men except dick went over in the

truck two draft horses clumping unwill-
ingly along behind the cook rode nancy
a fairly good saddler the winding two
miles of sand road were soon covered

  already the settlers streamed into
proutys yard they knew although the
warm sunshine caressed them and the sky
beamed a friendly blue that caprice ruled
late autumn in this northern latitude rain

adventure

or snow might start in a few hours with a
killing drop in temperature they must
act quickly before exposure and hunger did
their work on the lost man

  some came in two-horse wagons others in
single buggies the rest on horseback a
number carried rifles and wore filled car-
tridge-belts in the pine barrens shots are
invaluable for signaling the newcomers
exchanged sober greetings with the men al-
ready arrived and fell into low-toned con-
versation

  the cook from swede landing dismount-
ed tied his horse to a corner of proutys
log barn nodded diffidently to those near-
est and slipped away into the underbrush
at the foot of the ridge he climbed the
steep path veined with roots and slippery
with fallen leaves to the summit he
came out on the crest of the easternmost
hill and stood kneedeep in the brown-tipped
vegetation that rippled in the gentle breeze

  a splendid sight met his eyes the
ridge is higher than it looks and dominates
the country dick had taken a telescope
from the garland cottage before starting
now he swept the horizon searching for a
moving red dot in a vast expanse of brown
and green john garland wore habitually
a crimson stocking-cap it would stand
out clearly enough against this background

  to the north clearwater lake sparkled
and dimpled in the sunlight to the south
rolled an uninterrupted ocean of emerald
olive and reseda with a rare frost-turned
small maple like a pillar of flame on its
bosom

  the manistee hills guarded the south-
west on their side a great yellow scar
showed where a forest fire swept bare the
earth to the west another green sea of
vegetation flowed at last between parallel
ranges in the far distance

  east was the smudge of the town of
rainbow with the screened dome of a
sawdust burner two church spires and
formless blotches which were houses
southeast a tiny streak crawled northward
the morning passenger train from chicago
heading for the straits of mackinac

  over all lay a blue haze like much-thinned
smoke dick covered the land inch by inch
with the glass until his eyes smarted but
he saw no moving red dot he folded the
glass and went down the ridge as he
reached proutys yard a stout young man
with a small black mustache rode up in his

car it was mel houghton deputy and
son of the sheriff

  wheres your dad brusquely de-
manded buck cadger

  away up in the north end of the county
other side of the big swamp replied
houghton hes running down that kill-
ing at mound clearing worst of it is he
has the dogs and he cant get back to-
day maybe not tomorrow

  the foreman laughed offensively

  dogs say houghton them blood-
hounds ever find anything or anybody

  houghton smiled

  buck those dogs know more than
you do

  he went to where hank prouty stood in
the center of a group of his neighbors the
cook from swede landing unobtrusively
followed

  yes i saw him prouty a little man
with a much-wrinkled face was saying
early it was right after sun-up he had
one o these knitted red caps on and a
mackinaw i went out to feed the team
and noticed him on top o the hill lookin
off to the east came down after awhile
got a drink of water from the well and
sorta wandered off didnt say anything
when i spoke to him seemed friendly
enough

  which way did he go asked the
deputy

  i dont rightly know confessed the
settler the old woman called me in to
breakfast and i didnt see i asked him if
he wouldnt have a bite but he smiled and
strolled out it seems to me he went
around the other end there and headed back
toward clearwater

  the lake road divides on the north side of
the three sisters one branch goes south-
east to skirt the buttes the other turns
west to a settlement lying a mile away be-
hind a jackpine grove

  dick farrell edged off in the direction the
settler pointed he scrutinized the sandy
track after several minutes he returned
to the main group it had been joined by
cadger the foreman at home in a shirt-
sleeved crowd where he achieved a sort of
popularity dominated the talk

  believe me i handed that slob of a webb
somethin he declared if that bird
hadnt been lazy as an injun thisd never
happened he knew better than to lay
abed
boon of the wilderness



  the cook plucked timidly at his sleeve
say buck mr garland had on those
shoes you bought for him didnt he

  the foreman turned with a scowl

  dont bother me

  didnt he persisted dick

  cadger drew a long and baleful breath
as his eyebrows came together

  have i got to bump yah yet he de-
manded

  cant you answer his question coolly
asked the deputy sheriff

  cadger looked from the cook who seemed
to grow small and insignificant under his
stare to mel houghton and back again

  well what if he did he grunted
noting that the others by their attitude
seemed to demand an answer

  what was on the heels

  say who do you think you are there
was a half-moon of steel and about four
brass-headed nails on each side of it
come on over here urged dick to
houghton

  he led the way to the west fork of the
road there outside the wagon track in
the sand a line of footprints showed the
heel mark a semicircle at the back with
dimples on either side clearly revealed it-
self houghton followed it until the tracks
lost themselves in the wilderness

  he stared over the rusty green plain
hell veer to the left he said thinking
aloud lost people always do they
take a longer step with the right leg hell
come on around a circle but we dont
know how big it will be maybe five miles
or ten or twelve if he lies down that
stuffll hide him he nodded to the sweet
fern and bracken which grew tall and
thick if he gets hurt or tires out we
couldnt see him till we fell over him he
returned to the prouty yard

  mr garland started west from the upper
end of the ridge he began raising his
voice any of you see him

  they did not answer and he went on
hes out of his head you know not
crazy but just lost his memory cant
think just like a two year old lad except
that hes strong and all right in body or
was but hell veer to the south well
have to cover every inch of that out
there- he waved his hand to the wilder-
ness-to make sure he hasnt hurt him-
self and cant get up he wouldnt know
enough to yell

  looks to me well have to do some
skirmishing suppose we line up about
twenty feet apart those with horses i
mean well form a line with the left rest-
ing on the road well go south for a mile
say wheel around with the right as a pivot
and come back across see what i mean

       some murmured assent nearly
every man under thirty present
had been in the world war they
understood he addressed him-
self to the older men

  plgw a mile-long furrow thirty horses
or about six hundred feet wide we keep
on plowing back and forth until we find him
or until dark the -cars can chase around
wherever theres a road and search all the
empty shacks you fellows afoot can tele-
phone away off to the west and south and
make sandwiches and coffee at the cottages
and bring em over guess we can spare a
team for that

  if we dont find him before night how
about a bonfire on the three sisters sug-
gested dick and that other hill off to the

southwest if he came tohis senses-

  good stuff agreed the deputy four
of you fellows look out for that you stick
with me farrell i want a horse whos
going to let me have one

  immediately a settler brought a big bay
forward from the brisk movements of
the men it was apparent they approved of
his plan and were anxious to get to work
many of them had learned on deer-stalking
trips or in searching for strayed cattle how
deceiving were the barrens how many
folds and valleys cut those tricky plains
some had taken part in manhunts be-
fore they knew how vital was haste

 just a minute commanded buck
cadger importantly guess you people
know this aint no paupers job mr gar-
lands a rich man when he comes to his
senses-doctor says thatll be before very
long now-hell see the finders well paid
whether he does or not his wifell take care
of it shed be here now only shes sick in
a hospital downstate

  lets go said houghton

  they formed the long line at the end
of the first mile swath they talked it over
all felt the space between horses could be
increased by half they could see farther
than the deputy had anticipated taking
the new distance they patrolled back and


adventure

forth farther into the wilderness without
result until just before dark then a shout
from the upper end of the line brought them
galloping recklessly through bramble patch-
es and over fallen trees

  against the side of an abandoned railroad
grade hank proutys eyes caught the tassel
of the lost mans cap it was all but buried
by fingers which patted it in with the nicety
of a child who plays alone all about were
finger marks and tramplings

  stayed here for an hour id say re-
marked prouty as houghton dismounted
wasnt scared or worried laid down
there- he pointed to a scooped-out place
in the sand-and had a little sleep
wasnt hurt wasnt hungry or thirsty
just havin a good time buried his cap
like a kid and went off an forgot it

  the settler looked about studying the
grade the broken ferns marks which were
as print to his experience and went on

  came here a little after noon when
he started off again he went quick and
strong as if he knew where he was goin
that way

  he pointed to the southwest where the
setting sun touched the horizon between the
twin ranges of hills he turned to his col-
leagues

  aint that right

  you bet hank

  youve figgered it out

  thats just the dope

  they agreed with hearty promptness
well come on it was buck cadger
blustering as usual who spoke lets go
find him were losin time

  prouty shook his head

  no use cant do anything more to-
night if he went straight and we knew it

we might foller him-

 with the bloodhounds broke in
houghton

  well yes with the bloodhounds agreed
the settler in spite of cadgers sneer but
if he started to wander again no chance
got to wait till daylight suns gone

  as he spoke the great shield turned crim-
son vanished except for a fragment dusk
and the chill of the north came down
prouty followed the footmarks but soon
he gave up grassy turf formed above the
mold of a fallen pine all signs were lost

  tomorrow boys said the deputy
right here early

  disregarding his own slow and bulky

mount buck took the reins of the garland
saddler from dick and put his foot in the 
stirrup

  here what you doing remonstrated

the cook ive been riding him

  i ride him now

  cadger halted in the act of mounting in-
vitation in his manner the others ex-
pectantly waited but after a moment
dick dropped his eyes shambled to the
broad-backed sorrel and climbed aboard
somebody laughed physical cowardice is
not condoned in the barrens then the
group broke up each riding his separate
way as he plodded toward swede land-
ing successive prickly waves oftehame swept
over farrells thin body

  beacons burned on the hills during the
night all the searchers were back early
next morning all and more other volun-
teers came as news of mr garlands plight
spread by telegraph over the state again
they wheeled back and forth across the
barrens working to the south and west
but they found nothing

          the search did not absolve dick
farrell from his duties as cook
refill when the swede landing men
rode into camp in thick darkness
they had nothing to do except wash up and
smoke and grumble over their delayed sup-
per dick cooked it urged on by the con-
stant pelting of oaths and filth from the
foreman it was eight before the last
voracious appetite was satisfied it was
nine and most of the gang were snoring
in the bunkhouse before dick finished the
dishes and made preparations for break-
fast he sat down then in the comforting
heat of the kitchen stove outside a fine
rain had begun to fall

  he felt gloomy and depressed he knew
they regarded him with contempt because
he had not stood up to cadger besides
mr garlands fate preyed on him he had
never seen the lumberman before drifting
here had never heard him speak yet
garlands face was likable even under the
blur of the aphasia it was too bad there
wasnt much hope now after two days
this rain was pretty sure to finish him

  a hurried knock sounded on the door
dick threw it open there stood young
houghton raincoated bracing himself
against the uneasy tugging of two heavy-
shouldered beasts the bloodhounds
boon of the wilderness



  get me something the chief wore-his
gloves directed the deputy eagerness vi-
brating in his voice wrap em in paper
so theyll hold the scent

  the dogs you going tonight breath-
lessly inquired the cook

  sure am dads just back dead to the
world i borrowed me a horse over at
prydes wheres cadger

  here whats wanted

  the foreman in his stocking feet entered
from the bunkhouse wing he slipped his
suspenders over his flannel shirt as he came

  get your horse buck you and i are
going out after garland

  cadger scowled

  in all this rain

  you bet you there was grimness in
the deputys tone this kind of a rain
keeps the scent but the wet makes it hard
to handle the dogs

  lets split it three ways then cut in
dick swiftly im in on this

  fine agreed houghton

  dick ran to mr garlands cabin and came
back soon with a pair of gloves well
wrapped in a newspaper also he brought
two thermos bottles in a leather case the
parley at the door still went on

  i dont see the use the foreman was
grumbling them dogs cant track him
after forty hours there aint a show in
the world and in all this rain well
ketch our death of cold hes done for long
ago

  do you want me to say you refused to
go the plump jaw of the young deputy
thrust out at cadger seemed hard as stone
his little mustache lost its air of foppishness
this fellows a man thought dick to
himself

  the foreman cursed over his shoulder as
he turned to the bunkhouse

  oh im cornin he snarled

  ill drive your flivver over houghton
told dick you saddle up cadger can
ride my horse well start from that place
we found the cap i think ive got the
dope

  with you in a minute promised the
eager cook ill make some coffee and
sandwiches if we find him hell need em
soon they were off the car twisted along
the sandy track under the expert hands of
houghton the dogs rode in the tonneau
the horses jogged along after

  all - foolishness growled the ill-

tempered foreman needle in a haystack
is a snap alongside o this what show we
got why there aint moren one chance
in a million of stumblin on him

  but there is that one chance dick
pointed out as mildly as possible

  bucks reply was to curse him

  its this way began houghton step-
ping out of the car it stood beside the
road in the shadow of the three sisters
ive been thinking what this nurse told
me about garland gives us the clew the
chief was crazy about the sunshine wanted
to be out in it all the time while the sun
shone he was happy the only word hes
learned to say since this aphasia took
him

  was sun well what of it inter-
rupted cadger he shrugged his shoulders
partly to fight the chill which struck through
his mackinaw

  everything returned the deputy
hes been following the sun

  say how do you get that way sneered
the foreman

  well he was fond of the sun prouty
saw him first looking toward the east early
in the morning

  what was he doing all forenoon then
he forgot it in playing around but
when he started after hed lain down to
rest he thought of it again

  youre nuttier than he is jeered
cadger

  we had a man at camp sevier during
the war who escaped from the hospital he
was delirious after an accident he did that
very thing headed right toward the sun
and kept traveling he didnt travel in a
circle garland hasnt either

how do you know broke in cadger
wed have found him long ago no hes
traveled right away from us so i think

its a good bet that-

  the foreman cackled disagreeably
  dream on

everything else has failed replied the
deputy all right boys shake em up
he spoke to the impatient dogs who
lunged into the dripping growth of the bar-
rens he guided them to the west

  here we are presently he announced
his flashlight threw its beams on three
burned pine stubs forming a triangle close to
a weed-grown railway grade they recog-
nized the place here the lost man buried
his cap in the sand


adventure

  houghton took from under his coat the
package dick had given him and unrolled
the newspaper he held the gloves to the
noses of the dogs until they ceased sniffing
then of their own will they began to cast
about seeing they were hampered hough-
ton separated the leashes he handed -one
to dick who had dismounted

  the animals grew intent they worked
in circles nose down coming back baffled to
the patch of raw sand which was the start-
ing point twice more houghton permitted
them to sniff the gloves which they did with
a grave air

  them overgrown pugs is bluffin ob-
served buck cadger pretty nearly ready
to go back and get dried out

  houghton did not answer

  the dogs went farther afield raising their
heads to point into the thin rain or to lunge
through the sodden undergrowth it was
jerry handled by the deputy who at last
found the scent whining excitedly he
started off to the southwest at a rolling trot
tom his companion dragged dick after
him

  hes on it cried mel houghton

  they went unhesitatingly for some dis-
tance cadger led the spare horse

  young houghton brought his impatient
dogs to a halt

  were on our way he announced
and theyre showing my theory is right
here farrell you get on that horse ill
buckle em together its easy now con-
ditions are just right

  can you handle the two of them
sure when they pull my arms loose
ill call on you fellows all right boys
shake em up

  they moved briskly in single file through
scattered jackpine groves then came a
valley of wild cherry the hardy little
trees lashed them with winter-bared limbs
the dogs did not falter or turn aside they
trotted steadily to the southwest noses
down straining at the leash the men
took turns two riding while the third en-
deavored to keep up with the tireless
hounds

  cadger grumbled loudly as he dis-
mounted for his first trick

them mutts dont know what theyre
doin he complained theyll take us off
into the bad lands a hundred miles from no-
where and lose us too if we aint careful
he jerked the leash from dicks hands

and contrived to step on his toes as he did so

when they had been on the way for three
hours houghton called a halt for lunch

in the poor shelter of jackpines while the
soft rain beat insistently on them they ate
a few sandwiches and swallowed steaming
coffee

  as they went on again they heard a
mighty whoosh-whoosh and a crashing in
the brush

  old buck deer observed the deputy

  the dogs gave tongue the hollow
bell-like tones echoed across the barrens
they challenged in angry voices some time
later at a distant bark

  wolves cried cadger almost tri-
umphantly now what chance has he
got

  bunk houghton spat the word out
contemptuously a wolf is the biggest
coward that ever lived theyd run faster
from him that he would from them wolves
never thought of jumping a man unless it
was winter and they were wild with
hunger

  the scent led across a slashing recently
burned over here lay the skeletons of
logs which caused dogs and horses to
stumble the darkness slowly became
luminous though thick as ever they
could see in a ghostly sort of way where
they were going in the sodden barrens
evidently a dull moon rose behind the
cloudbanks

  next the interminable sweet fern again
slowing the dogs with its tangles and
then houghton exclaimed as water splashed
under his feet-

  a cedar swamp and theyre going right
into it

  they stopped in dismay the dogs whim-
pered houghton cast the beam of his flash-
light about it revealed a trap of gaunt
trunks with short spiky branches standing
and lying in every conceivable position the
down trees were dark above from the rain
and white underneath with a livid un-
healthy color in places they lay four deep
with dangerous spaces between spaces that
ended in moss and muck and stagnant black
water there were tufts of coarse grass on
little hillocks that promised a firm footing
and lied in their promise as far as the
flash showed the dreary waste extended

  now will you listen to me demanded
cadger he went in there and drowned
himself thats all there is to that we
boon of the wilderness



can come back here tomorrow and fish for

the body its in there-

  i dont think so hough tonkin terjected
seems to me this nurse told me he was
afraid of the water isnt that so farrell
he did say that replied dick

  lets try something

  the deputy turned the bloodhounds to
the south and dragged them along the edge
of the swamp by main strength they
were reluctant to leave the scent but
within a dozen paces they sniffed whined
eagerly and were off at a steady pace

  duck cadgers smouldering dislike of the
expedition burst into open rebellion the
going grew harder the rain found crevices
in their clothing and chilled them their
legs ached a man scarce settled himself
in the cold comfort of the saddle before
decency urged him to offer himself again
except cadger always he waited until
dick in a voice flat with fatigue called to
him then he responded reluctantly and
with oaths

  when the swamp at last behind the cook
halted and said come on buck he re-
plied violently i wont do it yuh yellah
four-flusher you aint walked ten rod
yes he has snapped houghton who
noted how the slim figure swayed ineffec-
tively against the tugging of the dogs
he does a longer hitch than you

  well hell double it this time you
aint goin to make the goat out o me
you wont get down

  no not till hes walked a ways farther
theres a blister on my heel

  you big quitter houghton gritted his
teeth

  he slid from his horse and took the leash
from dick the cook struggled feebly
no no houghton it isnt your turn
we must go on returned the deputy
shortly get up on that horse

   aj the contempt of the deputy acted
        as a spur to buck little distance
        was covered until he called for the
        leash

  the soaked and weary procession went
on the rain purred and slithered upon
them the dogs no longer fought the re-
straining hand though they kept up a good
pace the scent remained strong they
showed no hesitancy

dick slept bowed in the saddle until his
head almost touched the pommel he

rolled from side to side with the plodding
step of the horse his bones ached to their
marrow his muscles seemed to have
shredded away leaving the rawttierves bare

to the pitiless storm

j cadger jerked back the dogs and stopped
  come on dinky he commanded
  there was no answer

  say tryin to keep me walkin all night
  the cook stirred but did not waken

  the man dropped the leash seized dick
by the heel and threw him from the saddle
houghton turned his horse and reached out
a hand to prevent but too late

  whats the matter with you cadger
he growled the kid was asleep

  well that waked him laughed the fore-
man

  dick crawled from the bush into which he
had fallen without protest he took charge
of the dogs

  some time later he rode with the deputy
again while cadger trudged ahead hough-
ton turned to him

  this guy seems to have your goat far-
rell he said ijot unkindly but with some-
thing of contempt in his tone

  dick shivered

 he has he muttered he isnt
human

  he spoke in low tones and glanced fear-
fully at the foremans bowed and bridgelike
shoulders swinging forward in the gloom
above the dogs

  thats foolishness

  its so he isnt afraid of anything
hes strong as an ox why hell fight any
thing or anybody i saw him whip four
men at rainbow one night

  still bullies have been beaten before
now

  dick shook his head

  not this one he doesnt know what
fear is if he did i might take a chance
with him but theres no way of stopping
him

  sure there is asserted houghton
every mans afraid of something hes
got you buffaloed because you dont know

what it is but if you did know-

  it doesnt exist i tell you

  there was hopelessness in the cooks tone
and houghton did not press the subject

  the character of the country changed
the soil became firmer clay mixed with the
sand they were in the hardwood country
now open plains dotted with clumps of
go

adventure

oak trees beside the trail a good sized
stream gurgled

  houghton got down to take the dogs from
cadger the stream bank sloped at the
place he swung his flashlight peered and
then with an exclamation went to the
waters edge to stoop over footprints the
others infected by his excitement did like-
wise	

  the marks were deeply graven in the
mire most of them were filled with water
but one aslant and clear cut proved their
search prospered there were the fa-
miliar signs the half moon flanked with
bosses at the heel

  see cried houghton thats gar-
lands i could swear to it heres where
he went up the bank again

  get out o the way and let a man look
growled the foreman and thrust dick aside

  taken unawares he staggered backward
toppling toward the water one of his out-
flung hands caught cadgers arm with a
barking laugh the foreman shook himself
loose still precariously on his feet dick
splashed kneedeep into the stream

  cadgers mirth stopped in a gulp the
bare and greasy earth set atilt offered no
footing it shd him also upright but
floundering into the water at once he
tried to lift his feet to take a step to land
the stream bed as unstable as water sifted
away from his laced boots as if he stood on
masses of very soft rubber

  then the cozy particles closed over his
instep clutching with a thousand tiny
fingers yielding to his struggles but drag-
ging and sucking with a power as silky and
as ruthless as a tigers

  quicksand he shouted oh my
god get me out get me out quick
shriek after shriek high-pitched woman-
ish cries of pure terror followed he threw
himself forward his elbows on the edge of
the stream his fingers burrowing fruitlessly
into the mud he writhed and thrashed as
if in a convulsion

  it happened so suddenly that mel stood
motionless shocked and startled a cool
voice brought him to himself

  roll that log under his arms directed
dick the trunk of a young tree over-
grown and half embedded lay almost at his
feet he tugged and freed it and thrust it
into the fingers of the frantic buck

  the screams gave way to sobs and gasps
as the man clawed wildly at the log he

got it under his elbows raised himself
crushed it downward until it rested below
his short ribs houghton caught him by
the arms from above

  dont kick he commanded sharply
it only gets you in deeper dig your
elbows in right straight ahead now
keep your legs still i tell you heave
now thats it

  the foreman was weeping in abject fear as
he seized mel by the legs

  meanwhile dick sank gently forward
the roots of a tree thrust themselves from
the bank just in front of him the gnarls
offered good handholds he gripped them
gathered his strength and drew with a
steady increasing effort that all but frayed
his tendons the quicksand sucked thirstly
at his legs it seemed that he must tear
himself in two he could feel no progress
yet before he paused for breath he was
able to shift his grasp a few inches higher

  he rested tried again sweat bursting
from every pore the air whistling in his
throat eyeballs starting blood pounding in
his ears like a stormy surf the gain was
less he rested again utterly spent his
chin in the water the icy wavelets threat-
ening to cut off his breath

  on the third attempt desperation nerved
him he saw he could get no outside help
for houghton was fighting not only to
draw the insane buck to freedom but to
save himself from being dragged into the
trap so dick drew a breath far down into
his lungs and put everything into the try
the fingers of this slimy death grudgingly
slipped from his ankles and he crawled onto
the bank at the same moment houghton
hauled buck who had gone limp and pulpy
as he came free to safety

  dick was the first to recover he sat up
and even grinned a little if pallidly as mtl
played the flashlight upon him lets
go he said his voice shaky the chiefs
worse off than we are

  good boy ejaculated the deputy be-
tween panting breaths thats the stuff
he stirred the huddled buck with his
foot

  how you coming cadger

  the foremans answer was a groan
next time maybe you wont pull so much
rough stuff went on houghton a thread
of malice in his voice if you hadnt
pushed farrell you wouldnt have had to
bleat for help like a baby come on lets
boon of the wilderness



travel theres a mighty good chance to
save garland now that were all done
saving you

  funny but i never felt better in my
life dick confided to houghton when
next they rode together tired of course
but that quicksand is just what i
needed

  hows that asked mel in surprize
its given me my nerve back explained
the cook simply ive been a lot afraid of
just two things the past few years t b and
starvation lungs have been weak since i
got a touch of gas in france came up
north here to help em

  did it

  yes but i didnt feel much like work-
ing my money slipped away and first
thing i knew i was hungry

 you dont mean-

  yes i do actually hungry without
a nickel to buy anything to eat foolish i
know but i couldnt bring myself to beg
when you get hungry you get scared i
guess that was the reason i was so afraid of
cadger and of losing my job you saw
what i stood for

  mel nodded soberly

  but when i felt that quicksand at my
legs-why i wasnt scared i knew i could
get out and the thought came to me if i
can beat this i can beat the starvation
game i had been worrying about noth-
ing

  he gave a laugh of joyous relief

  the dogs led through a broken rail fence
into a field which had once been cultivated
they halted under a wide-spreading oak
tree the flashlight showed a farm wagon
its tires eaten by rust the wagon box
wrong side up lay near by one end
propped by a stone

  theres where he slept last night an-
nounced houghton throwing the light under
the shelter and he ate acorns see he
broke away the shell of one of the many
pellets scattered about and crunched
sweet acorns not bad at all

  a trying two hours followed evidently
the lost man had forgotten his drive of the
day before the scent led crazily about
wide spaces doubling and knotting upon
itself to the puzzlement of the dogs fre-
quently he stopped to rest farther up the
trail led to the stream garland had lain
down to drink the imprint of his hands
was plain

  suddenly the aimlessness ceased the
dogs struck a course and followed it

  hes going somewhere muttered hough-
ton nerves tense

  he led them toward civilization neat
piles of stovewood stood among the trees
the dogs padded into a grassy lane their
heads up following easily the scent mel
and dick strained their eyes to pierce the
darkness ahead the thrill of anticipated
success warned them buck cadger walk-
ing or riding spoke no word fatigue per-
haps shame at his weakness quenched his
coarse spirit

  the procession splashed through never-
ending puddles the woods gave way to
half-grown saplings grown up since logging
operations of years before the lane be-
came a road at last it turned to the right
and crossed the stream by a rumbling wood-
en bridge

  they approached splotches in the gloom
a deserted house and barn the dogs
bayed loudly sweeping past the barn and
to the door of a lean-to which joined the
house the men threw themselves from
their horses and crowded in

  mr garland sat in a corner asleep his
arms clasping his knees his whole attitude
that of a man making himself as small as
possible against the deadly chill as the
light flashed on him he woke and raised his
head his eyes showed intelligence they
saw that his brain was functioning again

  found me eh he asked in a voice
husky with disuse

daylight the rain had
ceased when they came out at a
settlers log house not far from
kalkaska they had crossed the
vast area of bad lands which stretches like
a blot through the upper part of the penin-
sula

  the settler and his wife were up soon
the kitchen stove glowed through its rust
and the iron teakettle sang for breakfast
was in the making mr garland ap-
parently none the worse for his adventure
sat comfortably behind the stove with a
motion of his head dick called mel hough-
ton outside the sky was cloudless the
air tingled electrically the red rim of the
sun peered above the horizon

  i want you to stick around im going
to lick buck cadger

  you going to fight him


adventure

 here and now when i think of the
 way that guy walked on me--

 dick stopped and clenched his fists

 but youre all tired out remonstrated
 the deputy wait till youre rested after
 breakfast-tomorrow  

 dick shook his head

 not another minute

 but hes bigger than you stronger
 why kid hell murder you

 the cook straightened himself his chest
 arched his figure seemed to fill out

 i can trim him hes nothing but a
 rough-and-tumble scrapper no science
 ive always boxed that is always till i lost
 my nerve but im not afraid of going
 hungry any more im not afraid of him
 im not afraid of anything since back
 there in the quicksand

 he opened the door a challenge in his
 voice

 cadger

 the foreman came out bulking huge as
 a grizzly in the morning light he rubbed
 his eyes

 well dinky what you want

 im going to fight you

 the foreman looked at him in amazement
 i dont want to fight now im hungry
 im tired

 youve got to fight youve been
 bully of rainbow too long come on down
 here if you arent afraid

  buck threw off his vest and descended
from the rough-board porch

  all right dinky he sneered if youve
got to have it

  it was a beautiful fight too bad more
people couldnt have seen it mel houghton
said afterward buck cadgers gang at
swede landing for instance however he
told them about it so vividly that bucks
tenure as foreman ended next day a boss
so completely licked by a mere stripling
doesnt remain a boss very long in the
jackpine country a man who elects to rule
by his fists must rule

  the deputy sheriff was so busy enjoying
the battle that he failed to notice early the
door of the house swing open it stayed
open while dick went down and bounced up
at once like a tumbler while buck be-
wildered by the cooks footwork and his
rapid fire of cutting blinding smashes went
down again and again and finally stayed
down

  then came a voice from the doorway
it was the voice of john garland woods-
man who had seen many a good bare-
knuckle fight

  some scrapper he said in his halting
husky tones i can use a chap like you
who are you working for

  dick panting wiped the blood from his
chopped mouth and grinned

  you he said
lawyer	 captain manslield

                 author of bung up and bilge free

 hen san francisco was young
and fair and rigor mortis had not
set in on american shipping tall
ships of many nations passed in
and out through the golden gate

  during the summer trade winds the skip-
pers with local knowledge would take ad-
vantage of a flood tide and a fair wind and
sail to an anchorage in the bay thereby
saving their owners a bill for towage

  this was a high-handed proceeding from
the tow-boat peoples point of view but it
quite met the approval of the sailors board-
ing-house keepers and their runners for
as the tall ships neared the lofty cliffs of the
marin county shore the westerly winds
would let go the sails would flap idly as
she rose and fell on the ground swell rolling
in through the heads the ships would slow
down in this calm but keep steerage way
until lime point or point caballo was abeam
where the wind would take hold again

  during this short spell of calm the
boarding-house runners who had gone out
to the heads in their small whitehall
boats would hook on to the ships sides and
swarm aboard they would inveigle the
sailors to board at the house they repre-
sented if it was a ship flying a foreign flag
the men would be importuned to desert leav-
ing their accrued small pay and reship out of
san francisco at big wages three months
advance pay in a lump sum was the bait

captain carlin the skipper of one tall

   yu duck sea lawyer copyright  by captain
mansfield

ship the pegasus was saving his owners a
bill for towage this was the young cap-
tains first command and it behooved him
to be economical he stroked a glossy
blond van dyke beard to which he had
not yet become accustomed and regarded
the flapping sails as his ship came under the
lee of marins tall cliffs

  he had been many times in and out of
san francisco but never as master and
never in the ship he now commanded all
was going well so he had no cause to worry
until the ship slowed up in the calm then
seeing the boarding-house runners making
for the vessel he fixed the pilot with a stare
from angry blue eyes and said

  -those crimps ive a good mind to

keep them off the ship theyll steal every
man jack aboard of her

  dont do it captain warned the pilot
theyll hold you up for a crew when you
are ready to leave

  so the skipper held his peace and looked
at the chicken in earnest conversation
with mr sinnett the mate

  he knew the chicken to be the most
notorious crimp on the waterfront and that
he was then in the height of his success in
his business of supplying men or whole
crews for ships

  well blast my tarry toplights if it
isnt brother sinnett was the chickens
greeting to the mate as he tumbled in-
board over the rail whats the trouble
old fatsides the chicken continued in
his oily insinuating way i sure expected




adventure

to see you skipper of the old water wagon
this voyage whats happened

  mr sinnett cursing with extreme vigor
grasped the chickens arm and led him over
to the deck house near the galley

  come over here he said his voice un-
steady with passion where we got the
deck to ourselves and that swab on the
poop deck there- jerking his thumb at
the captain- cant hear us ive got
something to tell you

  mr sinnetts tale caused even the case-
hardened chickens eyes to grow big as he
listened quickened interest showed in his
face as he slapped the mate heartily on the
back

  ill go you me bucko mate ill go you
even if i lose he said

  then with a warning wink as the boat-
swain was approaching the mate continued
in a loud grumbling tone

  that was a-uva lot of lubbers you

put aboard the ship last voyage

  the chicken chortled with glee

  i remember said he part of a thresh-
ing-machine crew the dead one i shipped
on the bark cassandra adams i got a
bunch of real men for you this time though
if you need em he lowered his voice
but wots in it fer me if i turn this trick of
yours you was talkin about

  in it fer you repeated mr sinnett
with much heat dont you git his three
months advance dont you git the blood
money wot more do you want im no
bloomin millionaire

  too cheap fer a job like that you
know how i can get mine run the whole
crew off the ship work em till they will
be glad to run away and leave their pay
then i puts the new crew aboard sabe
mr sinnett had just time to wink a fishy
eye when an order from captain carlin on
the poop deck terminated this delectable
talk and sent the mates watch to the fore
braces and to stand by the anchor

then yu duck the ships can-
tonese cook withdrew a listening
ear from an open port in the gal-
ley near which the mate and the
chicken had been talking he lighted a
pinch of chinese tobacco in the brass bowl of
his long bamboo-stemmed pipe the stench
of which would have betrayed his presence
earlier and with stoical features walked
to the opposite bulkhead of the galley

stopping before a calendar that hung there

 the one deep inhalation that he drew into
his lungs he now blew on the calendar
causing the cockroaches to scatter and thus
give him a chance to peruse it

  this calendar of yu ducks was a work of
wonder to him he consulted it with rev-
erence even on trivial matters on each
well-thumbed page was printed the day of
the chinese moon and our gregorian cal-
endar in english also a quotation from
the analects in chinese and in english it
also extolled certain wonderful medicines
that would cure all the ills that chinese
flesh is heir to and it gave lucky days and
omens

  him mate-flool offered yu duck

softly to the wildly fleeing cockroaches

  he turned up each page from the bottom
with slightly trembling fingers until he
came to the page of that day his black
bead-like eyes glittered as he held the page
steady and read

   three errors there be into which they who wait
upon their superiors may fall

   i	to speak before the opportunity comes to
them to speak which i call heedless haste

   ii	refraining from speaking when the oppor-
tunity has come which i call concealment and

   iii	speaking regardless of the mood he is in
which i call blindness

  for some little time yu duck studied the
lesson for the day until his sphinx-like yel-
low countenance formed an expression the
countless small wrinkles in his face ran to-
gether making creases his eyelids blinked
once this was as near to a smile as he
could make it as he smiled he stated to
the cockroaches what was evidently his
summing up of this lesson in philosophy

  him-good book

  then as the rattle of smooth-running
blocks came to his ears the cook from long
experience knew that the foresail was being
hauled up he left the galley and hobbled
to his station at the foresheet to lend a hand

  when the anchor was down and the cap-
tain busy in the cabin with the custom
house people eight bells were struck at
the sound yu duck atomically as if
he were performing a ritual looked at the
clock changed a pot of coffee from the stove
to the locker top and stuck his head out
the galley door he saw no sign of the
steward whose duty it was to carry the
coffee to the captains cabin

  whashee malla asked yu duck
yu duck sea lawyer



possibly addressing the cockroaches and
speaking for the third time that day

  to yu duck custom was as the laws of
the medes and persians the skipper had
to have his coffee at four oclock though the
heavens fell though the ship were sinking

  so one rheumatic old leg followed the
other over the high door sill of the galley
one old heedless slipper after the other
went flap-flap along the deck as yu duck
carried the coffee pot aft

  what do you want you old canton
river pirate said the captain with pre-
tended gruffness dont you see im
busy get forward where you belong

  error number one chanted yu duck
softly but emphatically as his black eyes
glittered

  he placed the coffee pot on deck and
shuffled back to his galley on the way
his eyes blinked once

  that was his second smile that day

  when inside the galley the old cook con-
sulted his calendar at once

   three errors there be   

  i to speak before the opportunity comes to
speak which i call heedless haste

  you bettee exclaimed yu duck nod-
ding his head sagely when he had read that
far me no can speakee hlim book
-good joss

  captain carlin took the desertion of his
crew with increasing indignation until he
was ready to fight his own shadow he
rowed with mr sinnett for overworking his
men but all to no purpose each morning
the crew grew smaller in number

  the mate answered with truth that the
work was imperative and the fewer the
men the harder those who were there must
work he asked the skipper with ill-con-
cealed mirth to engage new men at har-
bor wages until they were ready to ship a
crew for sea

  the skipper turned on his heel at this and
mr sinnetts fat belly shook with silent
laughter

  curse the luck ground out the skipper
as he turned his back on the mate if i
knew that blubber-bound lubber was run-
ning the men off the ship id-

  there were scarcely men enough left to
handle the mooring lines when the ship was
towed down from port costa and docked at
mission rock to finish loading

  the captain paced the deck anxiously

how was he to explain to his owners why he
could not hold his crew why he had to
ship men and pay them three times the
wages of a home crew and the blood
money he would have to pay for the men
how much would the chicken hold him up
for he wondered

  then the thought came to him that he
was not the only ship master in san fran-
cisco harbor who would be hauled on the
carpet to explain on their arrival home
older men friends of his who had com-
manded ships for a longer time than he had
years to his age were made to suffer from
the same system

  this thought was comforting and after
all ship owners had reasoning faculties
they would know that it was through no
fault of his that his crew had deserted

  in this somewhat cheered frame of mind
he started to go ashore to keep a dinner
engagement at the home of a friend in the
western addition

  as he neared the gangway he saw yu
duck come out of the galley and shuffle
toward him as fast as his stiff old legs could
carry him the captain stopped and
waited for him at the head of the gangway

  me likee catchee flive dollar can do
began yu duck when he stood in front of
the skipper

  five dollars repeated the captain in
well-simulated surprize what would an
old highbinder like you do with all that
money you are not going to leave the
ship too are you

  yu ducks eyes blinked and became
lack-luster his skeleton figure seemed to
shrink inside his baggy dungaree clothing
as he chanted

  no leavee ship buy swatow tobacco
mebbe pe-lay little fantan

  the captains heart smote him
certainly cook ill give you the
money more if you want it i was only
joking im thinking youre the only friend
i have left on the ship

  as the captain passed him a ten dollar
gold piece yu duck blinked rapidly again
he clasped his two clawlike hands and
worked them up and down

  him che-licken-him mate- he began
in his singsong voice

  but the skipper thinking that he was
starting a paean of praise for the extra five
dollars interrupted him by a cheerful

  its all right old bag o bones keep


adventure

your weather eye lifting for these frisco
chinamen or theyll skin you at fan tan

  he looked at his watch and hurried down
the gangway

  yu duck gazed blankly at the broad back
of the retreating skipper for a moment and
then returned to his galley to consult his
infallible calendar turning up the page
for that day he read

  not to speak to a man to whom you ought to
speak is to lose your man to speak to one to whom
you ought not to speak is to lose your words
those who are wise will not lose their man nor
yet their words

  he read it again possibly to make sure
that there had been no mistake in the first
perusal

 then yu duck commenced to swear
fluently in english he called down curses
on the mate and on the chicken he
cursed the mates ancestors back to the be-
ginning of time he cursed the chickens
ancestors-if he had any which he very
much doubted-back to the same era

  then the old cook with a deep sigh that
sounded somewhat satisfied quieted down
he stuck a few chinese punks upright in a
small box of sand that he kept for that pur-
pose and lighted them next he arranged
the largest pots and pans on the galley
deck and grasping the iron poker beat them
in a very business-like manner

  that fat obscene turtles son of a
mate would not allow him to use fire
crackers to drive the evil spirits off the
ship so he had to use other means

  when mr sinnett that same fat mate
and what was left of the crew rushed to the
galley door at the sound of the terrific din
the cook was calmly wiping the pots and
pans and stowing them in their lockers

the ship pegasus was being
towed to sea loaded to her plim-
solls marks with california wheat
she buried her clipper bows deeply
into the westerly swells that were running
on the bar

  her new captain the erstwhile mr sin-
nett strutted proudly on the weather side
of the poop deck his dream had come
true and he was enjoying it to the utmost

  for captain carlin had disappeared
late of an afternoon two days before he had
left the ship to visit a friend in the western
addition he never reached his friends

house the police did their best but in the
short time before the ship was ready for sea
he could not be located

  then mr sinnett cabled the ships own-
ers explaining the captains disappearance
and asking for orders the cablegram was
promptly answered

send ship home by sinnett

  so mister sinnett was now captain sin-
nett and he halted his proud step at the
break of the poop and called blusteringly
for the new mate that he had shipped to fill
his former position

  aye aye sir responded the new mate
from the main deck a few feet below him

  have all those drunken swine that were
put aboard turned to yet

  all but one sir answered the mate
hes some kind of a dago-still sleepin
it off i cant wake him but ill try
again

  to - with him loose the topsls

we got to get sail on the ship before the tow
boat lets go of us

  the mate with another aye aye sir
ran forward bawling his orders and as he
shouted close to the forecastle door a
man lying in a lower bunk inside the fore-
castle opened his eyes at the sound of the
hoarse voice bawling his orders with
great effort and groaning the while he
worked his legs over the side of the bunk
and sat up in this position he grasped his
head with both hands and stared into the
semi-gloom of the forecastle

  as his eyes grew accustomed to the light
or lack of it the blank expression of him
changed to amazement sea chests and
canvas clothes bags were piled indiscrimi-
nately about sea boots and oilskins kept
company with pretentious shore clothes in
bunks where their owners had thrown them
empty bottles were scattered about and in
the bunk opposite him peeping out from
under a brand new souwester was a bottle
half full of whisky and a pound plug of
tobacco it all spoke eloquently of a new
crew being turned to as soon as they ar-
rived on board

  the wind whistling and droning through
the ships cordage and the crash of the seas
on her bows as she dived into them told
him that she was under way

  he suddenly became conscious of an-
other presence near him when from a form
that had been as stationary as one of the
yu duck sea lawyer



inanimate sea chests came a familiar voice
you de-link littee coffee you eatee
one piece toast

  then yu duck the chinese cook shuffled
out of the shadows toward him in one
hand yu duck held a sailors hook pot filled
with coffee he hooked the pot on the edge
of the bunk by the sick mans side and
offered him a piece of toast from a tin plate

  yu duck said the invalid weakly
what am i doing in the forecastle
whats going on

  tin plate and toast clattered to the deck
as the aged cook jumped at the sound of a
voice he had heard before he recovered
and peered into the strangers eyes

  - yu duck swore fervently

  then the english language not being ex-
pressive enough in extreme cases he con-
muned with himself in cantonese

  the stranger brought him out of it with a
stern

  belay that you old hatchet man i
asked you a question

  but yu duck hesitated he would tem-
porize with this madman until he could
consult his good joss his calendar

  you no sawe yu duck name what
ship you belong where yu duck cook
the stranger took a drink of the hot
black coffee got to his feet and held on to
the bunk

  cook he said you havent got the
sense of one of your own galley cockroaches
who gave you a ten-dollar gold piece the
other day if it wasnt i

  - began yu duck as he started for

the door and the omniscient calendar

  stop come back here and tell me
what you know about this was the stern
command

  yu duck shuffled reluctantly back took
a small mirror that was hung swaying to
the roll of the ship on the wall and held it
up before the strangers face

  you no belong skipper you no belong
 man you no belong clapta clarlin
who you belong i te-link you belong one
dago

  captain carlin looked at his reflection in
the mirror and understood gone was his
reddish van dyke beard always trimmed
to a nicety his yellow hair was cut short
and dyed a glistening blue-black to the
lobe of one ear there hung coyly a small
gold earring his skin was stained a light
mahogany color his mustache also dyed

   

black was curled up at the ends and held
by wax on each side of his high roman nose
to add piquancy and to crown this look of
ferocity there was a ridge bristling with
black hair that began at the top of his fore-
head and extended back out of sight it
was where a lead pipe in the hands of the
chicken or one of his henchmen had formed
itself to thecontour of his skull and knocked
him out he had been shanghaied as a sea-
man aboard his own ship

  while yu duck held the mirror he
watched keenly each expression on the
captains face expressions varying from
different degrees of astonishment and pure
unadulterated anger to grim determination
the ancient cook read them as he would
his calendar and a great light dawned

  me much savvy have got you clapta
him mate- him chelicken makee one
piece talkee me catchee one piece talkee
in galley him chelicken makee shanghai
claptan other ship then him mate belong
claptan

  what grated the captain whats
all this gibberish say it again slow

  so the cook repeated what he had been
longing to tell the captain for days and in
the repetition twisted his english more than
ever but the captain got his meaning and
sent him for the mate

  tell him to come here at once

  him mate no mate now objected yu
duck shaking his head him belong
claptan now

  go thundered the captain doubling
his fist and striding toward the cook

        yu duck went-with astonish-
ing agility for one of his alleged
lllp years-but not to mr sinnett
ariim the whilom captain instead he
made a straight wake for the galley and the
calendar so dear to his cantonese heart

  while he consulted it with surprizing
eagerness captain carlin in the forecastle
awaited his return with the mate with what
patience he could muster his head ached
he felt faint and dizzy so he sat on a sea
chest and drank the remaining coffee that
was in the hook pot he felt drowsy and
would have slept but the loud slatting of
the head sails as they were being hoisted
brought him to his feet

  with a muttered curse he strode to the
door and nearly collided with yu duck
hurrying in


adventure

  him number one piece error no can
do number two piece error can do but no
can do number three piece error can do
chop chop

 shut up-you wheres the mate-

sinnett rasped the captain then push-
ing the startled cook out of his way he
strode to the forecastle doorway and
looked along the busy main deck at the
crew setting sails

  ill get to the bottom of this business
now he muttered as he stepped on deck

  nor did his bearing for the moment be-
speak one who would shun a scrap in the
getting eut he miscalculated his strength
and would have fallen from dizziness as he
staggered aft had not the heaving deck sent
him against the rail he held to a friendly
belaying pin and glared savagely at a
strange mate

  the strange mate returned the glare with
interest cursed him roundly and ordered
him to tail on to the halyards of the main
top gallant sail that he was setting

  jump to it you spaghetti-eatin blacka-
moorl bellowed the strange mate quickly
ill have no malingerin dagos aboard this
ship

  he rushed with clenched fist at the cap-
tain who had made no move to pull on the
rote as ordered but stood with a grim
smile grasping the belaying pin and sum-
moning all his energy to meet the onrushing
mate

  the mate at close quarters swung for the
captains jaw the latter ducked jerked
the belaying pin out of the rail and brought
the end of it down on the mates head as he
spun half way round from the force of the
punch that missed its objective

  the new mate dropped to the deck like a
plummet and the skipper still grasping his
weapon of defense made a second wobbly
start for his own end of the ship

  back-you he ground out at the boat-
swain who had hurried to the mates aid
lay your hand on me and ill brain you

  at the sound of the captains voice the
boatswain halted abruptly eyed him with
looks of astonishment then grinned sheep-
ishly

  --your lap-streaked hide joe he blus-
tered look wot you done to the mate go
turn in again an sleep it off he coaxed the
captainll have you in irons for that job

  the captain ignored the boatswains
importunities

  carry that man to his room he ordered
pointing to the fallen mate and addressing
the mates watch that stopped work and
gathered round him

  good for you dago offered one old
salt to the captain

  bully boy joe he sure got wot was
cornin to him said another swearing
lustily and jerking his thumb at the mate

  shut up you swabs roared the cap-
tain calling both men by their names which
brought a laugh from the others of the
watch and caused the two enthusiastic ones
to look at the dago in wonder

  then came a throaty voice from the poop
deck that made the skipper grind his teeth

  wots the matter with you men forrad
there stop your fightin and get that to
gallant yard mast headed before i come
down to you

  the watch paid no attention to this
order and threat but followed the tall form
of captain carlin aft keeping a respectful
distance from those flashing blue eyes and
the iron belaying pin

  whos the dago whos the bloomin
eyetalian were the questions passed from
man to man of the watch on their way aft
but none could answer save that he was one
of the new crew

  looking down at the captain as he
neared the break of the poop deck mr
sinnett his mate-his chief officer who had
sailed from liverpool with him and now
was usurping his command

  the man was plainly nervous his new
responsibilities-the fight on the main
deck-the sight of his mate being carried
below-and no doubt a guilty conscience all
told on him

  wot do you want aft here my man
he asked thickly as the captain ran up the
steps to the poop deck and faced him go
forrad where you be-

  what do i want you cursed crook you
i want you first

  with that and while sinnetts look of
annoyance changed to one of surprize at the
sound of a familiar voice the skipper again
wielded his deadly belaying pin

  sinnett jerked his head aside so there was
a bit of his ear left on his fat head as the
iron pin caromed to his shoulder he
staggered then bellowing vengeance made
for the cabin entrance

  but the skipper beat him in the sprint to
the companionway-and his gun sinnett

backed handsomely till he fetched up
against the weather rail quivering like a
jellyfish as the skipper followed him with
deadly pertinacity

  sinnett was cornered his retreat cut off
except by the way of the main ship chan-
nel-overboard like the cornered rat he
was he squealed-

  help youmea grab this crazy man

  the men appealed to were the second
mate and his watch who were on the poop
deck setting sail on the mizzen they had
stopped their work to gaze spellbound at
this exhibition of cyclonic wrath from one
of their own shipmates-a dago at that-
whom none of them knew

  at sinnetts cry for help they came out
of their daze to obey his order but halted as
the second mate reeled back among them
from a blow of the captains fist halted and
gazed with increasing excitement at one of
their watch in the mizzen rigging just over
the captains head the man had been
aloft loosing sails and now was descending
stealthily as a cat making signs for them to
stand back

  then the man in the rigging directly over
the captains head swung inboard hanging
by his hands and let go

  the skipper following sinnetts exultant
glance aloft had barely time to spring aside
as the man came hurtling down

  the foolish look on the sailors face when
he missed his quarry changed to chagrin as
the starboard watch hooted him for his
clumsiness he was reaching for his sheath
knife when the captain rapped him with his
iron pin down he went and the ship
taking a weather roll carried him to the
ashen-faced sinnetts feet

  sinnett jumped over the unconscious man
and bolted narrowly missing another blow
from the swift-working belaying pin he
found refuge with the port watch that
headed by the boatswain was swarming on
the poop to see the fun as he ran he yelled
lustily to the second mate and boatswain to
grab the crazy man

  grab him yourself advised the second
mate who was nursing a rapidly closing eye

  but the boatswain long accustomed to
the slogan obey orders if you break
owners did the best he could

  nab him bullies he roared in stento-
rian tones to the port watch nab the
guinea before he massacrees the new cap-
tain

  so saying and followed by the port
watch he started to round up what was to
him a hostile greek sailor on the war path

  at that moment the fat mr sinnett came
through the companionway to the poop
like a porpoise broaching and breathing
like one close behind him was yu duck
the ancient cook

  sinnett after mingling with the men of
the port watch had rushed into the cabin
by way of the main deck for his revolver
he met yu duck coming out yu duck
had a gun an old long-barreled  caliber
peacemaker revolver he waved sinnett
up the companionway sinnett climbed the
stairs the gun muzzle poking him in the back

  the ships a madhouse he yelled
heres the bloomin cook gone off his
head too take that gun away from him

  yu duck grinned glanced at the men who
were about to rush the captain and hurried
to the latters side to give him the gun
then he extracted from under his shirt a
razor-edged hatchet and balanced it with
affectionate precision

        the fresh breeze played with
a yu ducks baggy clothing it
fjayy streamed the stray gray hairs on
 his brow and his long queue to
leeward and as he shook the keen-bladed
weapon at the crew with the light of battle
in his snapping black eyes he seemed the
personification of a hatchet man out for a
rival tong

  the skipper took the proffered revolver
and to yu ducks whispered words him
no catchee bullet laughed joyously

 now you men who think i am not
master of this ship step up and prove your
arguments he said looking at sinnett
the cook has more sense than all the rest of
you put together

  him belong clapta now quoth the cook
as he balanced his hatchet

  wot do you know about it cookie
asked the boatswain with an evident desire
to parley pay out your cable lets
hear from you	

  him book in galley good joss shrieked
yu duck him book plenty savvy me
look see

  book is it came back the boatswain
with fine scorn shiver me timbers he
knows the old man be the book its the
bell book and candle he means blow me

  haw haw haw roared the boat-
swain slapping his leg and looking
at the other men who were also laugh-
ing thats a horse on our bucko
mate he croaked when he recovered
his breath

  the spell of ill feeling was broken even
the second mate forgot his bruised eye for a
moment and joined in the laugh

  three cheers for captain carlin the
skipper wot came back yelled the boat-
swain throwing his cap in the air

  an to yu duck the pagan priest of the

pegasus cut in sails the sailmaker above

  belay that noise you toggle-join ted

himself heard

  he looked around for sinnett but the
erstwhile mate had sneaked off to his room

skipper shouted again let go that tow
line bosun dont you hear the tow
boat whistling

  keep her souwest mr second mate
he said to that officer get the kites on
her and the anchors on the focastle head
and call me before we leave the light ship
he stalked to the companionway leading
to the cabin-and to mr sinnett

  yu ducks old heelless slippers went
flap-jiap along the deck as he hastened to
his galley to bum a punk of praise in front
of his beloved joss his calendar

i-s will remember it all all the
whole forty and more years of
it-every day that we can and
w-j every night-and be glad it was
me billy that was with me-you and me
billy were a whole lot ourselves all wrapped
up in one another one thing was to teach
one of me something and another thing was
to teach another of me something-you
cant learn all of lifes lessons just in one
way or just in one day-youve got to be
patient some day youll develop into just
one bill and thatll be at the end when
the road grows shadowy then billy well
not be afraid of the shadows or the branch
glooms overhead well just plug along a little
way farther till the end of the road comes-
and go round the bend with a laugh

 remember the tusitala-the ship that
morley bought well i hope that some-
times at night-time theyll all go fast to
sleep and leave her alone under the stars
with only her mate look-out and man at
the wheel-as she was in the good old days
when her sisters were so many for therell
be times when shell be wanting to remem-
ber her sisters and the days that once were
i do hope that the people who own her will
remember that maybe shes got a bit of a

spirit all to herself it sounds crazy maybe
yet i think often that things that are so
lovely have spirits ive met her at sea
years and years ago

  in the middle of the street where i live
there stands an old old oak-tree that was
here long long before the city grew to be
even a village birds have nested in it
have courted in its leafy branches chil-
dren have woven poppy garlands under it
teamsters and mules have rested under it
at noon its an old-timer it was here
when ships came to and went from frisco
in great fleets bearing awav when they
sailed the cargoes of grain from this one-
time wheat plain

  now now that the old days are over that
the ships no longer come that the grain is
no more grown that the town is growing
fast theyre chopping the old tree down-
because they say it will be in the way of the
pavement

  they prefer concrete to a tree-an old
oak-tree whose every windy murmur is
romance it will be dead by tonight i
tried to save it but that wasnt any good
the women of the town tried to save it-
but that was all in vain it is dead-by
tonight

author of rockets at daybreak a sergeant of cavalry etc
the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

tt was in june  that we routed thefrench
at dettingen in bavaria we had been without
food or fodder for many a day and as soon as the
french broke leaving open the road to hanau the
army forgot the enemy in its eagerness to reach its
base of supplies

  my nag was in such a plight that i was left be-
hind and in the night came upon a french officer
and killed him after a long-drawn fight i relieved
him of a fine sword rings gold buttons and other
booty then austrian marauders our allies set
upon me badly wounded i lay out in the marshes
until a party of our own men found me and carted
me to hanau

  a physician named gulf took me into his house
and cared for me in exchange for one of the rings i
had taken from the frenchman when the army
marched out of hanau i was left behind for i was
still very weak some days later i was discharged
although i was in no state to travel and the doctor
would have robbed me of my last gold button had i
given him the chance

  at a near-by tavern i met a youth viscount barnet

       hen it was broad day and we
had stopped a moment at an
inn or rather a pot-house to
have a mouthful to warm our
bones the viscount began to swear after
a time he stopped and appeared to be cheer-
ful once more there was a choking fire
there a mean tiny blaze that would
scarce light a pipe and before this we stood
to attempt to dry our garments

  there were no guests at this time of the
day except a drunken grenadier that lay
in a corner so we had the place to ourselves
this country had all been laid waste the
winter before by the austrian irregulars

who had deserted his post because he wished to
reach england in a great hurry an estate awaited
him there but he was without funds and in debt
he suggested that i let him exchange my booty for
money lend half the sum to him and that we travel
together to the coast this i agreed to do although
gulf cursed me for a fool and went so far as to offer
me a commission in the army of the pretender
charles stuart but i cursed him back and left his
house

  we started the viscount and i in the frankfort
diligence but were held up by a scouting party
which tried to slaughter us for the officer knew that
barnet was a deserter we were almost beaten
when a party of horsemen that i had seen at gulfs
house came to our rescue they cut down the
scouting party and rode away no sign could i find
of barnet until i reentered the diligence and found
him hiding beneath a bale of goods

  do you owe those men money i asked

  well not money but something of the sort
said he and then would speak no more but held his
peace chewing upon his fingers

the inns were poor the farmers had but
little stock and there was hardly any travel

  i am sore perplexed said the viscount
i fear we have begun an ill-starred jour-
ney the army can not be very far ahead
of us since there are patrols and drunken
soldiers so thick and i am running my head
into a hempen gorget i think i will aban-
don this project entirely the weather is
too wet and the country rough

  you would be a fool to throw away an
estate for a little rain be thankful we
have this journey to make in summer and
not in midwinter

  umm he muttered and when the

adventure

bodies of that patrol are found there will
be as fine a hue and cry raised as ever was
heard by fox on an autumn morning and
if our fine diligence drivers peach upon

  he tugged at his neck and dropped his
head upon one side with goggling eyes and
lolling tongue to imitate a man who had
been hanged

  if you had been watching what was go-
ing on instead of cowering under your hides
like a child under a coverlet in a storm of
thunder you would have seen one of those
strange horsemen dropping a french cap
one of those things they wear about the
camp near the body of the officer so then
who finds the bodies immediately cries out
that french raiders have done it

  now was that so he cried clapping
his hands was it so indeed that
was a clever thought that man had discre-
tion by the teeth of paul and i did
cower indeed for i warrant you that those
three men had more swordsmanship in the
back of their necks than most men have in
their ten fingers

  here the drivers called to us and we
went out to the diligence once more we
had no further discussion but sat dripping
in our wet clothes until we came into
frankfort it was plain that we were
catching up with the army for we kept
passing bodies of horse and now and then
saw them spurring across the fields after
some of the many stragglers that peeped
at us from every bush and covert as we
went by

  we came upon many broken wagons and
dead horses left behind as the army ad-
vanced as we came into the city the dili-
gence was halted the goods inspected and
all the rolls and bundles prodded with bayo-
nets to be sure there was no one concealed
therein the viscount and i showed our
papers and were allowed to pass without
hindrance

  the viscount was apprehensive and kept
his eyes going from right to left and his
sword ever ready to hand until we came
to the inn where we got down and went
into the common room here there was
so much smoke and such a concourse of
people soldiers of all armies citizens
thieves camp followers sutlers and i
know not what else that the viscount felt
secure and indeed none would have recog-
nized him except by a searching look

perhaps for a man looks very differennt in
civil attire than he does in uniform

  let us have some meat and something
to drink and get ourselves good and warm
and dry began the viscount and then
let us see what we can do to make further
plans i fear we must go horseback after
all for the northern reaches of the rhine
are too wild for us i have had enough of
fighting i promise you and harky keep
your eye peeled for a sight of any of our
six friends if theysee us we are as good
as dead

  we ate and listened to the talk it was
all of the army having crossed above ma-
yence and the probabilities of its going to
worms and of the french spies that were
reported loose in the army and that patrols
had been searching for since the day pre-
vious and of how poor the forage was and
that the duke was very likely to be made
lieutenant general for his work at dettin-
gen though if truth were told i think it was
my lord stair that did the disposing of the
troops

  after we had eaten we went about seeing
what we could do for a boat to take us down
to the rhine and then the rest of the way
to the sea wandering about the muddy
streets and in peril of our lives either from
the horsemen galloping about or the rum-
bling carts that crowded one to the wall and
then showered him with mud

  no one knew of a boat that could be had
nor of any one who did boating for it was
low water and the most of the boating and
rafting of timber was done in the spring
moreover the viscount was averse to spend-
ing the great amount of time that would be
necessary

  neither of us had much idea of how long
it was to go by water to the sea but we
knew that the netherlands were the next
country to flanders which was not far off
and so it could not be at a great distance
but it seemed from our talk with these
people that we would be lucky to reach the
coast before the setting in of winter

  that settles that matter said the vis-
count that settles it properly there
is nothing for it but to go by horse for your
diligence is too slow and they are forever
getting mired also we on horseback will
have more chance against any one that has
evil intent toward us i have no stomach
for doing any fighting from a cart nor from
the ground
the bold dragoon



  no thats true enough i agreed once
at that is enough

  so we applied to the host of the inn get-
ting a seller of cattle to speak for us and tell
us what the landlord said for we had no ger-
man we found that horses were for hire
they being rented for the stage that is to the
next town or so whence they would be re-
turned and we could get others thereupon
we went to bed in very deep feathers and
were sore bitten by fleas so that we were glad
enough to be up in the dawn and to horse

we rode for the next fort-
night making easy stages on
account of the burning heat and
because i was unable to stand
the longer ones and so got well into flan-
ders we were intending to make for
ostend where we would have the best
chance of getting into england there
were few travelers for pleasure because
of the troubled times but there were great
numbers of soldiers either messengers or
convoys for supplies or officers going on fur-
lough trotting by with a servant or two at
their backs we passed from time to time
drafts of green raw open-mouthed recruits
their ill-fitting uniforms still creased so new
were they from the magazines and the mens
faces still white from the shopor healthily
browned from working in the fields and too
clear eyed for soldiers

  we kept from the routes that led toward
the army when we could lest the viscount
meet with some one that knew him but
we could not always avoid the soldiery
since there were not many passable roads
and it took all of these to keep the army
supplied

  we had come at the end of a baking day
to a small town near brussels which city
we hoped to make the following day we
turned our horses into the yard had them
watered and went into the inn to see about
lodging and supper and the hire of horses
for the morrow

  there was a great sound of singing and
shouting from the common room and we
should have known enough to stay out but
we did not and went in and found the place
filled with officers young men for the most
part who had just had commissions bought
for them and were going out to join their
regiments they were little more than boys
though there were some older men among
them probably returning from furlough or

army business at home the viscount and
i looked at each other and came to a stand

   we had best go in now said i for they
have seen us and if we duck out it will look
more suspicious than if we go in

  well lets stay in a corner then and
take no part in the drinking for as sure as
i shall burn in- some one of these ban-
tams will know me and our journey is at
an end

  your journey i reminded him

  aye said he sourly enough i said

my journey be-to you

  with that we went in and sat down in the
darkest corner

  for all it was summer and the heat of the
day terrible the nights were chill and so a
good fire was built up and these men sat
about it smoothing their new lace and wag-
ging their shoulders to let the light glance
on their epaulets and swearing and drink-
ing prodigiously to show their manliness
and acquaintanceship with the world

  they were singing songs in turn and con-
tinued to do so while the viscount and i
broke our fast miserably on tough mutton
kidney and watery wine some of the
officers sang sentimental songs and others
songs that were not sentimental but which
were applauded to the echo nevertheless
and then one got up and waving his mug
sang a new one written about our battle
that i thought was well done enough

   then up rode billy the bold

   and made his horse to prance

   he showed that he came of a mold

   that could fight as well as dance

   ten thousand of france he slew
   while he fought by his fathers side

   when his leg with a ball was pierced through
   smart money my boys he cried

the roar after that ended shook down the
dust from the rafters and such was the gust
from the cheering that the chimney smoked

  there was one young man that sat near
us and his round chubby face was as inno-
cent as that of a babe he could not have
been above fifteen if he was that old but
he howled with the rest and waved his mug
in air and discreetly poured its contents
into the sand of the floor when he was un-
observed

  how long have you been with the
army i asked him

  a matter of a month or more replied
chubby-face noting my citizens cloth with
disdain and putting up his nose at me


adventure

  so you are all for beating the french
said the viscount and full of eagerness to
meet the monseers

  eager i am said chubby-face and
when i have met the enemy i shall beat
him and i can

  do you know what the war is about
i asked

  faith that i do not said he save
that it is about some -- queen or other

  here the viscount and i laughed so
hearily at this young mans innocence that
we were quite breathless when we were
finished we found that we were like to
laugh from the other side of our mouths
before the evening was done an officer
had been singing a very heartbreaking song
about the maiden fair that he had left be-
hind and he would see her no more alas for
his bed was on the cold moor and his knap-
sack his pillow though i have never seen an
ensign with a knapsack yet

  be that as it may we had laughed at the
very most heartbreaking part and the offi-
cer in question was regarding us very wrath-
fully as were the rest of the company we
were both sober enough then i promise you
however seeing from our looks and our con-
fused faces that it was not at the song that
we had laughed the young fellow would
have doubtless gone on but that a fire-eater
an officer of horse an older man who had
undoubtedly been telling them all ever
since they had left england what a blood
drinker he was got staggeringly to his feet
and vowed that he would sweat us

  now ever since our encounter with the
patrol between hanau and frankfort i
had been accustomed to taking the picinino
from my belt and hiding it in the hay or
under a hedge or somewhere outside the inn
and thus escaping a good deal of pointing
and peering and loose talk about it for it
was a french sword and there was no dis-
guising the fact so on this night i had
slipped the sword into the stable thatch
and gone in to supper without it and hence
when this brawl seemed to be breaking on
us i had no weapon and was like to be in
sorry case the blood drinker moved on
us a little staggeringly but very sternly
withal and came to our table

  ha said he thrusting his face into
mine our song makes you laugh does it
it is for such as you that we die and are
eaten by the ravens and you find something
to laugh at in our songs i see you wear no

sword what are you huckster sutler or
hedge priest that you follow the army
weaponless ha i would kick you out of
doors only i am over cautious of my boots

  i said nothing in reply but looked him
steadily in the face and he thinking to have
done me down turned to the viscount

  i had had little opinion of the viscounts
courage he was such a trembly finger
chewing sort of a man he was a gambler
a deserter doubtless a rogue when he could
muster the courage and his actions during
the fight with the patrol had not certainly
been those of a bold man he had indeed
killed one of the troopers but he had broken
off the fight afterward and run and hid
under the hides so then when the fire-
eater turned his burning gaze on the vis-
count i expected some signs of dismay
instead the viscount looked the other very
steadily in the face and curled his lip in a
sneer

  do you find something to laugh at in a
soldiers song roared the fire-eater

  are you a soldier asked the viscount
very innocently

  the fire-eater was quite upset by this
question and could only wag his jaw fi-
nally he found breath and opened his mouth
to roar at that instant the viscount swung
his mug and the wine that it contained shot
down the fire-eaters throat and near
strangled him he coughed and gasped
and choked and stamped about

  meanwhile the company of officers began
to murmur among themselves and began
to leave their tables and gather around us
i looked about me for a weapon and re-
solved that if i was so lucky as to escape
from this broil with my life i would
never so much as let the picinino out of my
hand again

  the fire-eater had cleared his throat and
dashed the tears and wine from his eyes the
while he bent a very fierce gaze upon the
viscount

  your life for this he roared and tugged
out his sword

yf	the viscounts bench clattered

x m against the table leg and fell
thudding into the sand while his
sword flashed into the firelight
like a tongue of lightning instead of put-
ting it in guard however he rested the
point on his toe and folded his hands the
fire-eater seemed no less thunderstruck by
the bold dragoon



such conduct than the rest of us for he
came to a dead halt and the most laughable
expression of surprize and wonder came
over his face his eyes wandered from the
viscounts face to the roof then about the
company and then fluttered a little

  then the fire-eater seemed to melt in-
side and went slumping down on the sand
like a candle before a hot fire there was a
shout of surprize or rage i could not tell
and every one pressed forward to help the
fire-eater to his feet

  i shoved with the rest to see what had
caused this strange occurrence but when i
had come near enough to see it needed no
second look to tell me that the officer of
horse would ruffle and bully and rant no
more he had been thrust through the
heart but so quickly and so dexterously
had the viscount done it and the room be-
ing a little murky from the smoke and in-
sufficient fight that none of us had seen the
stroke

  it was an awful thing a mysterious thing
to see this man die so quickly and suddenly
and i could see that many of the wide-eyed
smooth-faced youths were a little sick and
beginning to wish they had stayed at home
at this time some one shouted treach-
ery and the company blazed like a dry rick

  the first one that came to hand i knocked
out of the scene with as shrewd a blow as
ever the great broughton delivered i had
up a stool and swept some more from the
scene with it but they were all barking and
clamoring with more noise than a pack of
hounds at the kill and reaching over each
other to prick me with their swords

  i grabbed a brad-awl out of one young-
sters hand but it was a cheap blade such as
the costumers sell to these springalds and
it broke under my hand i beat down with
the stool again and it shivered into bits the
leg breaking and the rest of it flying off into
the crowd

  thereupon i mounted nimbly upon a
a table and unhooking a mug from the row
that hung on the beam broke it upon the
head of the first cherub that i saw as fast
as they came to the table to lay hold of me
i put my foot into their faces and unhooked
another mug or two and broke it as before
and even began to laugh and enjoy it for
it seemed that i was going to make the table
good against them all

  now the people of the inn who had taken
to their holes when the brawl had first

begun seeing that their store of mugs was
likely to be laid waste began to bestir
themselves first a large fat woman per-
haps the innkeepers wife began to cast
boiling water about and the cherubs on
the skirts of the crowd gave tongue im-
mediately and took to their heels clutch-
ing themselves

  the innkeeper and a maid or two set
themselves to drag away all they could lay
hand on but the press was so thick and
the room so dark by now with the dust that
was raised that they did not make much
headway i broke a jug on the head of the
innkeeper and he went out of sight with
little desire to return

  this was an act of folly on my part but i
was so shaken by the fight and the excite-
ment and the thought that i was beating
them all that i forgot all wisdom and so
hove the mug at him with a will where his
bald head shone against the dark his
wife perceiving this raised a howl that
rang above all the rest but i gave it
little heed

  the more fool i for just as i was stand-
ing on one leg with the other outstretched
to kick an enemy under the nose a flitch of
bacon sailed through the air like an ill-
omened bat and catching me where the neck
joins the head and unbalanced as i was
swept me from the table and into the crowd
then they had their revenge upon me i
promise you and the last i remember was
being cast bodily from the door into the
stable midden and glad enough i was to fie
there

  it seemed but a minute before i came to
myself but it was late in the night and the
moon up and the viscount pouring water
from his hat into my face

  you great simple ass said he as soon
as he saw my eyes open and knew that i had
my sense back what a goose you are
havent you brains enough to know that
the time to be going is when they are all
goggling at the slain man it is a wonder
you were not killed

  what became of you i gasped amid
my groans as i attempted to rise

  why when i had killed that ruffler so
so neatly that it took him some time to find
it out himself i just went out the door while
they were all looking at him and so i went
into the stable and having put saddles on
our horses prepared to go and then i heard
the play starting so i waited to see what
io

adventure

would come of it and sure enough a great
booby of a dragoon comes flying out the
door and after him all the fledglings well
they were put out of the inn and the door
shut so we have no more to fear from them
for they have taken themselves off and gone
elsewhere to do their howling come on
your fpet we must put ground between
us and this cursed inn up now stir your
pegs

  you rave said i i am in fifty parts 
by the feel and can not stir a foot to save
myself from the gallows

  that is just what we are fleeing urged
the viscount we have let steel into a
man and that is not a hght offense for a citi-
zen to do to a soldier outside of england

there are no civil courts here by the-s

tail up now here are the horses give
me your foot

  my head was spinning and i was exceed-
ing sick at the stomach but i managed to
get into the saddle where i lay down upon
the horses mane letting my hands fall on
either side the viscount took hold of the
rein and was for leading out the hores but i
remembered my sword

  hold i cried as loudly as i could
hold i have forgotten my sword

  be-to it said the viscount spur-
ring his horse

  i shall not stir a foot without it i

shouted ho you- halt by-

ill have the place by the ears halt i say

you runagate ho there you-white-

livered cadger

  oh - groaned the viscount this

cursed lubberly dragoon will be the hanging
of me yet stop that howling peace for
the love of andrew with his heels in air oh
-be the day i ever set out in your com-
pany dont get down or ill never be
able to hoist you up again where is your
sword ill get it for you where is it only
stop this roaring

  i directed him to the thatch where i had
thrust the sword and he found it easily
enough i belted it with trembling fingers
and away we went the viscount spurring
and cursing and looking over his shoulder
the inn was closed and dark and the people
probably within it under the bed for an
officer had been killed in their house and
they expected to find the roof afire over
their heads

  ride cried the viscount ride ride
we must get away

p we trotted as fast as our
tired horses would go and that
was too fast for me and we came
shortly to a crossroads one of
which so the viscount told me went to
brussels one to louvain and one north to
the low countries he dismounted and
walked about in the dark feeling in the
road with his hands and at last he came to
the side of my horse looking up at me
where i lay with my head hanging

  we cannot go farther to ostend said
he we can not take ship from the base
for it is running our heads into a noose we
must go north and cross from thence this

is a-of a mess we are in

  we i cried we you are the man
that slew the officer we if you had not
been so lively with your steel we had not
had all this trouble and i would not have
every bone in me broken

  he answered never a word but got to his
horse and away we went the pain of the
horses motion and the sickness i had and
the weakness that was still on me from my
wound wracked me most to death i
pleaded with the viscount to walk a while
and even tried to pull down my horse but
the viscount had him by the rein and so i
could make no headway in that manner

  after a time i began to curse and yell and
tax the viscount with torturing me pur-
posely i was in a sad condition because
these fledglings these chubby-faced boys
had all had big feet and they had marched
and countermarched up and down my bones
with the precision of a regiment of grena-
diers to say nothing of ringing all the hours
of the clock upon me with stools mugs and
trenchers

  finally i could stand the pace no longer
but simply let go and the motion of the
horse soon tumbled me into the road where
i lay and hoped that i would soon die

  the viscount rounded to without a word
and dismounted

  is this the end of you he asked

  i do not care the half of a clipped far-
thing said i this is a soft road and a
not overly cold night so leave me to die in
peace and not to be cloven on that cursed
beast i tell you i would rather ride the
wooden horse with a round dozen of muskets
tied to either ankle than spend another in-
stant on that one there leave me begone
now though he had half of my money i
had a wadset against his estate for five
the bold dragoon



times the sum so that i cared not the
slightest whether he stayed or went in-
deed i hoped he would go for he had
brought me nothing but ill luck and trouble
since we had left hanau

  the viscount straightened and looked all
around the country we were crossing one
of those great lonely moors that there are
in this country  all sand and desolation and
black night there was no house nor hay-
rick nor any place to cover a mans head
but i had little care regarding it the
ground was soft and i had my sword and a
man does no t die of exposure at that season
of the year

  listen said the viscount it is really i
that am in danger and not you oh curse
the day that ver i first girted on sword he
should not have tried to make sport of me

though for i am a fearsome man oh --

i should have but pinked him well lets
not waste time putting broken jugs to-
gether again listen we will go to rot-
terdam and from thence take ship i will
go ahead for i am the one they will seek it
was i that slew him

  i will wait in williamstadt for you go
to the sign of the gaper in kipstraat it is
found easily enough a turks head and in-
quire for me i will wait i promise you
we will find time and trouble enough get-
ting a ship sleep here you will be bet-
ter in the morning i warrant you you
will be much better in the morning

  this last he said as he was walking over
to his horse and then he mounted and was
gone i dragged myself across the road and
into the sand which was soft and even
warm then i put my sword out of the
way pillowed my head on my dragoons
valise and thought to sleep now having
my ear to the ground i could hear more
clearly than before if any one should ap-
proach on horseback so it was that i
heard the thumping of hoofs many of them
and i took hold of my sword though i had
scarce strength to draw it

  i thought then that these men if they
pursued us would press on after the vis-
count and not see me and so i decided
that i would not make any move to show
them where i was for i was a little weary of
bearing all the knocks while the viscount
got off with a whole skin therefore i
stayed where i was and in a short time a
party of horsemen went by black against
the black sky shuffling the dust in clouds

  it was quite dark but having them
against the sky as i did i could see that they
were not soldiers both from their headdress
and their cloaks they went clopping by
six of them three ahead and three following
riding hard and steadily though i could see
from the way their horses hung their heads
and from the sound of their spurring that
the beasts were tired

  so they went by and paid me no heed
which was not strange seeing that they
would have no way of knowing i was there
though plainly enough to be seen had they
thought to look and after they were gone
i tried to think what was remarkable about
them and where i had seen men like that
before

  this manner of thought took my mind
from my bruises and the soreness of them
so i followed it for some time and it was
not until i was very near asleep that i re-
membered where i had seen those horse-
men they were the six that had rescued
us from the patrol at hanau of this i was
as sure as i was of my own name i was
quite awake after that and could not get to
sleep for some time

  those men had said something about be-
ing eager to see my friend by which i knew
they meant the viscount and if they came
up on him they would get their chance
however i supposed that he would ride as
hard as they and having both horses now
could change from one to the other if
they came up on him let him look to his
neck for he would no longer have me to be
his shield

  when it was day and the sun shining in
my face i got up though i was so stiff that
i could barely stand however i must be
gone from this wild moor for there was no
shade from the sun nor any water which i
lacked sorely nor did i see anything in the
form of food i set forth hobbling but
after a time my bruises seemed to be less
painful and i could move with more dis-
patch

  i expected that when i had come to the
far end of the moor that i would come in
sight of houses ora town or at least a farm
but the far end receded and the more 
walked the farther away it seemed at
last it penetrated to my dull mind that the
edge of the moor did not recede but that
the farther i walked the more of the waste
i could see and that the dismal solitude
might be a days journey in extent
io

adventure

  with this sad thought in mind i sat
down and fanned myself with my hat for it
was coming on to be hot now sitting down
stiffened me so that when i started out
again i was in as sorry case as before and i
began to make up my mind that i was
going to die in the desolate waste and some-
thing in the back of my mind told me that
the viscount had known it when he had left
me there and taken my horse

  finally when i was indeed ready to give
up and to lay down and die i perceived a
high road in the distance and this cheering
me i pressed forward and at last came out
on it then i sat down by the roadside
until some conveyance should come along
that would take me to an inn there went
by very soon a great wain laden with hogs-
heads of spirits and upon this i climbed the
driver who walked at his horses heads
grinning at me the while after a time he
dropped back and tried to converse with
me but upon my shaking my head as a
sign that i had no understanding of his
language he grinned once more and said
nothing after that but whistled to his
horses and flung stones for his dog to chase

wmnim at sunset we came to the
walls of a city of considerable
jjjfpjk size i have since learned that
wil this was mechlin although i did
not know it at the time we went in and at
the first inn we went by i jumped down
waved my hand to the wagoner and went
in there was a very heiferish maiden with
her hands full of mugs that bounced at me
and i indicated by pointing my thumb down
my throat that i wanted something to
drink and by resting my cheek on my hands
that i wanted a bed she nodded her head
and very shortly the man of the house ap-
peared and looked very darkly at me

  whats the matter with you i de-
manded all that i wish is a bed and a
little supper and a mug of ale or beer or
what you have there is no need for this
glaring

  thereupon the man of the house ad-
dressed a few words to me that i understood
of course as well as he had understood
mine he perceived after a while that i did
not know what he said for he stopped and
looked helplessly about

  look said i and i went through the
motions of drinking eating and going to
sleep with my head on my hand

  the man of the house nodded with un-
derstanding then he took some copper coins
from his pocket and clinked them together
then he spun one on the table and putting
it in his eye winked at me with the other
from this i understood that he wished to
see the color of my money

  oh is that the trouble said i well
because a man is a little dusty and travel
worn and his clothes a bit torn is no sign
that he has no money here how much do
you want

  i put my hand into the pocket of my coat
where i carried my money in a leather
pouch the pocket was empty the other
pocket was also at this i took off my hat
and looked into it very foolishly the hat
was broken and bent where the cherubic
officers had beaten it about my ears but
there was no money in it after that i took
up my valise which i wore about my should-
ers by a strap and opened it my two
shirts and other things were there safe
enough but no money and i knew very well
there was none there when i undid the
buckles

  ha ha laughed the man of the house
and slapping his hand upon the board he
turned his back upon me and went away

  it is to be supposed that i walked out to
the street but i do not remember doing so
simply that one minute i sat in the inn and
the next i found myself on the pavement
wandering up the street here i was
lame and sore night coming on in a strange
city where i could not understand a word
of the language and knew not a single soul
and above and beyond and moreover
penniless

  i had no doubt that i had been robbed
the pockets of my coat buttoned with three
buttons and there was not the slightest
chance that the pouch had fallen out there
was no hole in the pocket so that it had not
fallen through no i had been robbed and
by some one who had had plenty of time
to do it for he had buttoned the pocket
again when had it been done the day
before i had paid for our noon meal so
that it must have been done between that
time and this either while  lay in the
midden or while i lay on the moor

  mmm thinks i my merry viscount
hath done this the doctor said he was a
thief and a liar and so he is i will wager
that he had my purse and trotted my horse
to make me ill and ready to fall off and stay
the bold dragoon



by the wayside while he went on with both
horse and money

  this was a disaster indeed for i knew not
how far i was from the coast and even if i
should win to it and be able to get passage
to england on the strength of my discharge
i would have no money when i landed and
would starve to death while i was finding a
means of livelihood

  some day thought i i will be upon
the track of this fine viscount and if the
men that passed me on the moor have left
anything of him worth killing i shall finish
him

  the first and most pressing need was for
me to find a place of refuge for the night i
came after a time to a narrow court with a
pile of casks under a shed and i turned into
it to he down under the little cover that the
shed gave however as i went in i per-
ceived an old woman regarding me very
angrily from a window in the building op-
posite so i went on for if i stayed in the
shed she might set the watch on me for an
idler and a loiterer

  this night i think was quite the saddest
one that i had spent for a long time for i
was all alone and sick and sore and very
bruised in spirit as well as body to think
that a man whom i had trusted should do
me such a scurvy trick

  after a time i found that my walking had
carried me into the central part of the city
to the great square off which were the
markets and in back of the markets a
great number of wains and carts the
carters were sitting about and though some
of them looked curiously at me the dark-
ness hid my tom and dusty clothes and i
kept my sword under the skirt of my coat
and so they saw nothing strange about me

  i would have lain down under any of the
carts but there was so much mud that i
could not so i climbed into one after awhile
and lay in the bottom and if the owner
objected then let him try his luck at throw-
ing me out

  thank heaven said i i can sleep
this night and then tomorrow will be an-
other day

  i breakfasted the next day on some tur-
nips that i managed to extract from a
basket and then i set out by inquiring
of passersby simply saying the word wil-
liamstadt which city was the one the vis-
count was to meet me at i finally discovered
a man who had the sense to know what i

wanted he pointed me out the road i was
to follow which i did and after crossing
the rest of the town i came to a gate and
set out upon the road that went north

chapter tv

of an uncertain voyage

i was seven days upon the road some
of the time i rode but most of the time
walked the heat was the most horrible
that i have ever known and at midday it
was so intense that a man must he down and
let its worst fury pass before he could go on
again the first part of me journey was over
the same wild desolate moorland that i had
crossed the day after i had been robbed
after a time however the country road
came into woods and then i made faster
progress both because it was cooler and
because my hurts were healing

  while i was upon the road i had much
leisure to think of my situation and i re-
membered that i had the viscounts wadset
in my valise and i made up my mind that
when i came to williamstadt i would sell it
as for meeting the viscount there i had as
much hope of that as a sutler of heaven

  i came within sight of the city at sun-
down one day but i had not the strength to
go on so i lay down under a tree and put off
going forward until the next day after i had
spent the night-and an unpleasant one it
was for it was coming on to be cold-i shaved
and freshened my clothing as much as i could
and cleaned a spot or two of rust from the
picinino in case i should have need of it

  then i set out very hopeful to see the sea
at last though i found out later that it was
yet some way off i was more than passing
thin for between what i could steal and
what i could beg and what i had been able
to buy with a few pieces of money that i
had found in my fobs i had had little
enough to eat

  i was sore bewildered by the great amount
of water they have in that country for the
latter part of the journey i had done noth-
ing but cross rivers or arms of the sea for
they smelled very salt and there was yet
another one to get over before i could come
to williamstadt however i passed it
over giving my last coin to the ferryman
who bit upon it and turned up his nose
but finally took it and so at last i was come
to williamstadt and at the end as i hoped
of my journey by land
no

adventure

    j i had devised while i was
slalnfei trudging across the moors that i
would go down to the docks when
i had come to williamstadt and
find out some british skipper and from him
get directions where the kipstraat was and
where i might find a money-changer that
would buy the wadset to this skipper
when he should be found i also meant to
apply for passage to england offering to
work my way and help in the handling of
the ship if it were necessary though i knew
rather less of ships business than a cow of
musketry however let him find it out
when we were at sea and i doubted not that
i could learn anyway

  there were a great many boats and ships
and all manner of sailing craft tied to the
wharfs and lying in the river i could tell
fairly well what country they were from by
their names those that bore saints names
i knew were not english and others had
jumbles of letters that were unintelligible
to me i saw one named martha and john
but there was no one aboard her save a boy
who replied with ribaldry when i asked
when the master would return

  i came to the end of that part of the
wharfs and turned back again toward the
city up what i thought was a way along a
river bank i found however that this was
another arm of the harbor and that it
shortly turned again and there was a very
quiet basin quite large and reaching as far
as i could see

  i halted to look about and saw just below
me a fat strong looking craft a fishing boat
perhaps for there was a great tangle of
nets in the bottom of her the middle was
all open but in the back part was a deck
and the roof of a cabin where the company
lived there was a red-faced hearty look-
ing man sitting on the cabin roof smoking
a pipe and looking up at the sky

  he had every look to me of an english-
man and i was about to cry out to him when
my eye lighted on the boats name painted
on the bow she was called the wd tev-
reden i was singularly disappointed by
this although i did not know why and i
was turning away with a very heavy heart
when the ruddy-faced man cried out to me

  halloa he cried this be ship youm
lookin for

  is it though said i astonished to hear
this man cry out in good old english tones

  aye said he nodding his head violently

i knowed un as soon as i see un with bun-
dle and great sword peter lad heres one
come a reddy

  a shock head came out of a hole behind
the roof and a great flat face like a moon
looked at me

  i am looking for a passage to england
said i doubtfully do you think i could
get one on your ship

  aye they said both laughing heartily
come aboard

  i thereupon jumped down onto the deck
and shook the red-faced man by the hand
it appeared that his name was giles and
that he owned the ship and that he had been
awaiting me for some time

  that can hardly be said i how do
you know i am the one you have been wait-
ing for

  at this question there was great grinning
and guffawing and when the red-faced man
was able he straightened up and then
touched the hilt of the picinino thereat
he leered at me very wisely well if he
felt that way it was no business of mine
and since he seemed to know what he was
about i did not show him my discharge
but inquired where there might be some one
who would give me some money for good
security

  i know un said captain giles peter
lad show gentleman to master reddle-
fields house

  master reddlefield lived hard by for his
business was mostly among the seamen i
judged and when we were come into his
house which was all one place half bed and
half counting chamber he appeared in per-
son and asked me my pleasure

  i have here a note of hand secured by a
wadset said i upon a scottish estate
now i would like to know if some money
might be raised upon it

  let me see said mr reddlefield

  i thereupon tendered him the wadset

  i perceive said he after a great deal of
squinting and pursing his lips that this is a
wadset upon the castle and lands of drum-
cleaugh for the sum of five hundred pound
scots how did ye come by this

  i loaned some money to a man and this
was his security

  i doubt if ye can raise a penny on it this
side channel said the man pursing his
lips no i know ye canna do ye know

    the pound scots was only worth a shilling of english
money
the bold dragoon

hi

anything of this gentlemans family or
name or his whereabouts now

  no said i that i dont his name is
the viscount of barnet and he told me that
he would meet me at the sign of the gaper
in the kipstrasse of williamstadt but i do
not know where it is

  here the man jem roared aloud and
even the sour-faced reddlefield cracked a
smile

  man yer two feet stand in the middle of
the place ye are looking for said he and
taking me to the street he showed me a
great turks head aver the door

  do you know anything of this man
something said he going in again
he sailed for england this day week

after that i began to curse and to swear
and finally the sour-faced man called a halt
hoots toots said he yell ha the

-amongst us if ye do not leave off such

awfu talk what gars ye curse like that
because i have been fooled and cheated
and have walked all these weary miles and
have not a penny to my name

  how is that asked he putting his head
on one side

  why you said the wadset was worth-
less

  on this side of the water on this side
of the water but now if ye wad like to
part with one of those bit jewels on your
finger i might be your man

  but jewels on my finger ah what a
fool here i had the two rings and had for-
gotten them entirely well i had them off
and after a deal of haggling got ten pounds
for the two of them and a little enough it
was then the sour-faced man overjoyed
at his good fortune i suppose at getting
my rings so cheaply sent a boy out for water
and fire and brewed us some tea

  when i exclaimed at that mr reddlefield
informed me that fire that is to say red-
hot turf and water are sold in shops for
tea brewing and that they can be bought
cheaper than keeping a great red fire
blazing a through the hot weather

  when the tea was drunk mr reddle-
field began to rub his hands and mutter
about its being his busy day so we took our
leave and went back again to the boat i
ate a dinner of fish and then feeling secure
and happy for the first time since i had dis-
covered my loss that i had been robbed
and having upon me a most delicious lan-
guor i asked giles where i might lodge

  why here on deck or on nets said he
and when i exclaimed he informed me
that there were no cabins aboard the
voyage being so short and that any passen-
ger who felt the need of sleep might he on
the nets which were soft enough so i
clambered down into the mid part of the ship
and lay down and putting my old broken
hat over my face went to sleep

i must have been more weary
than i thought for when i
awakened the boat was heaving
under me and the fresh cold wind
from the sea blowing down into the boat
on opening my eyes i perceived that the
great sail had been set and the wind blowing
against it was deflected into the bottom
part of the boat where i lay and so strongly
as to near tear the hair from my head i
got up and with some difficulty clambered
up to the deck

   it was quite dark but there was a kind of
light from the sea and upon looking about
i could see that we were sailing out of the
river mouth and the shores were stretching
away on either hand

  i turned from watching the low shce and
perceived that there were three men seated
on the roof of the cabin i had thought
them to be giles and his son when i had
come up but seeing three of them and
closer at hand i made out that they were
different persons one of them rose and
came over to me

   good evening sir said he very civilly
a pleasant night though a little chill
it is indeed said i for this season of
the year

  there are some of us will be colder than
this before this business is dispatched
aye i muttered not knowing in the
least what he meant

  but that is a small enough sacrifice
went on the other man if we can only
bring the wronged into their own again
now as he talked something of this mans
tone struck a familiar note in my ear and i
was so diligently searching my brain to think
where i had heard it before that i lost lrack
of what he was saying and could cnly
mutter that is true

  he must have perceived this for he came
very close to me and looking me intently in
the face said-

  you understand me of course

  no sir said i i do not-not a word


adventure

  and at that moment i remembered him
it was he who had spoken to me in the
doctors house and had been the leader of
the band that had fought with the patrol
before frankfort it seemed to me that he
recognized me also for he fell back a step

  ha the dragoon said he william-
stadt hath become as popular a port of de-
parture as ostend first the viscount and
now the dragoon

  the other two men now came and ranged
behind him and i noticing them making
slight motions of their hands bucked
forward my picinino so that it clanked very
loudly on the deck at once their swords
whistled and i warrant you that mine was
out as soon as any

  i perceived though that i was at a dis-
advantage for i had nothing to my back
but the open well of the mid part of the
ship which protected it well enough for
they could not come at me by that way but
if i so much as set back a foot to balance
myself or to draw beyond reach of an eager
thrust i would be overset and fall off the
deck and so come to my end with a broken
neck nevertheless i would let the blood
of one or two of them at least unfortu-
nately at this moment the man who had
been speaking stepped between us his sword
still undrawn and his hands held palm
upward

  gentleman said he very sternly let
no one forget his position here it is i who
commands that swords be drawn and when
they shall be put away there is no cause
for quarrel here put up i say

  what was she doing ratthng steel here
for muttered one of the men hersel
would rattle a few

  now this man was a highlander i knew
by his speech and immediately i guessed
that these three were jacobites and i was
considerably cast down for the best i could
see out of it was a cut throat

  my good man began the leader put
up your sword we are all friends here i
trust and there is not the slightest occasion
for naked steel we are as you perceive
three and i assure you we are not poor
swordsmen your name is hugh bancroft
is it not of ligoniers

  i answered that it was

that i believe is the seventh and i
understand that that regiment belongs to
the scottish establishment is that not so
i do not know said i if there was

any such thing it must have been before i
was born

  umph said he well i was leading
up to ask you if you were not scotch by
birth

  well and what then i asked

  simply this that having been tossed out
of the army hke an old sack and still being
young and full of life and doubtless thirst-
ing for a career of arms and being scotch
after all dye see i know of an occupation
that would fit a man of your kidney

  then he put his head upon one side like
a bird and though it was too dark for me
to be sure i was certain that he smiled
upon me

  come said he why not

  well i will tell you i replied first
off i have been tossed out like an old sack
as you have said and having gotten well
out of one army i am not like to get into
another one easily i have seen that in my
short life that would sicken me of armies
all the rest of it though i lived to be me-
thuselahs grandsire cursed and-and

maltreated at home by the very people we
protect and robbed and starved abroad and
our own officers stealing the clothes from our
back and the pay from our pockets

  so for a career of arms i have had my
fill of it and as for being scotch i was
born in chillingham and have little enough
of liking for anything scotch they are
rick burners and cattle lifters all for all their
high sounding names so i went on for
my blood was up and the other two grind-
ing their teeth and i will have none of
them and as for this career that you
would tempt me with i am a true subject of
king george and were i not i would
rather be the slave of a man that leads his
troops in battle and fights by his sons side
in the van than be the friend and com-
panion of one that hath not the heart of a
hare but that skulks in italy like a dog
under a shed

  there was a space of silence then in which
i could hear breath whistling then for-
ward steps a man

  my name said he very painfully and
panting as if he tore out each word by the
roots from his very heart is macdonald of
clanranald i give you the he in your
teeth

thereupon the highlander stepped up
her name he began very calmly is
dugald vich- something or other what
the bold dragoon



it was i did not know but something out-
landish and sounding like a smith rasping a
hoof-called dugald of the axe her
blood for the red-soldiers

  you are spies and listeners and creepers
about said i and three to one but i have

the right on my side be-to you and

all your beggarly kind

the highlander made such a
sweep at me then that he near
knocked my sword from my
hand and as i parried a thrust
from the macdonald man tried to run
under my sword and dirk me so that i was
obliged to kick him in the face here the
third man began beating down our swords
and crying on us to stop and giles and his
son appearing with lanthorns and great
horse pistols i began to despair of a suc-
cessful outcome of the fight

  put up cried the third man said i
not that there would be no fighting with this
man put up are ye all gone mad
you dugald a chief would you peril your
cause on the chancy outcome of a brawl
with a common soldier macdonald have
you no sight of the value of your hfe that
you throw it away on such a cast and
you my loyal booby of a dragoon you
should have a better sense than to be insult-
ing the men that are taking you to england
and that have more than once saved the hfe
of you put away your swords i say you
will have your belly full of fighting ere ever
we see corry arrack again now will ye
put up or must i have giles pistol the lot
of you

  they fell back sullenly enough their
swords resting on the deck and the high-
lander muttering in his own tongue

  i have had enough of englishmen said
macdonald sourly the viscount that
we thought would join us hath stolen our
papers and this dragoon will probably be
the death of us if his throat is not cut
that we will see about said the leader
very bitterly do you and dugald axe
go apart a way a word with you sir
and he led me to the opposite side of the
deck giles and his son seeing us peace-
able went off being busy with the ship
and the leader of the three men began to
whisper in my ear

  before i say any more he began tell
me where you left your companion

  outside brussels said i and i have

   

not seen him since though i would like
passing well to get my hands about his
throat

  ah said the other rubbing his hands
and looking at me very close and why
should that be

  because he hath robbed me as i have
good reason to believe

  robbed you say you tell us about it
how did he do it by stealth ill promise
you for your viscount is a stealthy
creature

  well i am not sure that he did it but
things point that way

  i then told him of the fight in the inn and
of how i had discovered that i had been
robbed and of the weary way i had dragged
myself across the dunes with money enough
in the jewel on my finger to have brought
me in a coach and six

  i doubt it said he there was no place
inland where you could have sold those
things but your viscount have you no
notion of where he went

  no said i except that he took ship a
week ago and mr reddlefield is the man
that speeded him

  i knew that said the other man

reddlefield would sell the-passage to

england if he were paid enough

  does he own this vessel

  no this boat is owned by honest or
dishonest giles who doth business by
carrying the friends of the right party from
shore to shore along with a bit of tobacco
and lace and a pipe or two of wine that
never sees the kings gagers and master
reddlefield hath a hand in that too you
may be certain he hath a good scots
tongue and can speak french and flemish
and draws many a fat fish into his net
when i came aboard said i the man
giles said that he had been expecting me
do you know anything of that

  none he replied except that giles
had knowledge of us and saw you with a
highland sword on your hip and looking
very like the chief of a powerful clan or the
head of an ancient house so ragged were you
and forlorn and fatigued withal there
is many a poor man wanders about that
might have been sitting in his own hall but
for that he danced a dance with the earl of
mar in the fifteen

  but we coming upon the scene giles
perceived his error and pointing you out to
us was for throwing you overboard all
ii

adventure

sleeping as you were but i objected for i
recognized you at once both by your frame
and by your sword he is the man will
lead us to the viscount thought i and if
not then a lusty recruit for the good cause
a happy acquisition for your fame has
been widespread in the army

  now here the good man stubbed his toe
for my fame had gone no farther than the
provosts officers with whom i have had
glory enough neither had he recognized
me before as i well knew however he
could not see me laugh in the darkness

  how do you know said i that i will
not denounce you to the first kings officer
we see after we land

  mark me said he laying his head on
one side again it were peril of your
neck for then i should feel it my duty
to point out the man who slew an officer of
his majestys horse in bavaria and another
one in flanders aha i pricked you
there did i and if i pointed out that the
man you did to death in the inn before
brussels was cousin to my lord stair what
would you give for your chances before a
court

  it was not i that slew him it was the
viscount i cried desperately

  thereat the jacobite gave a dry chuckle
who is to know that said he can
it be proven

  my silence said that it could not and i
must own i was considerably cast down
more so than i like to think upon for i saw
that this sorry thing would overshadow me
all my life that the officer of the patrol had
been slain and after him the captain of
horse in the inn in flanders and though i
had not struck a blow at either i had been
present and who was to know that i had
not done the killing

  come said the man referring again
to the matter of a military career i must
tell you that i am for england to go about
amongst men of some standing and see how
they lean toward a rising in favor of the old
party what with the kings espousing the
hanoverian cause so roundly and the
cursed troops being quartered on every hon-
est man and press gangs going about like
ravening wolves i think we can get up a
little feeling

 now i have here a wild highland
cateran fit more for the driving of cattle
than the accompaniment of a gentleman on
a delicate errand and a hot-headed officer

of the scots brigade who has not a thing in
his head but military terms and fighting
and a reeking scotch burr to his speech
we have left our servants behind and you
and i who speak good english of either
king could go about together and these
other two be our servants and so have no
need of opening their mouths in public

  i will have none of it said i i am
done with soldiering and as for your king
i would not spit on him

  the jacobite leaped halfway across the
deck and then leaped back again to my side

  i am a man of few words my buck he
hissed you join us or you hang i am
out two pound ten for your passage to en-
gland and i promise you that i will see you
lain by the heels or else a jacobite this time
tomorrow night

  then with no further word he turned his
back on me and went to where his com-
panions sat on the cabin roof

now here was a sorry coil un-
less i threw in my lot with these
jacobites they would have me
arrested and i might find myself
put to it to come free again true i
could come back at them by denouncing
them as spies but that would be little help
for there were many jacobite sympathizers
in england then and much more open about
it and brazen too than they were a year or
two later after their cause had been lost

  by this time we were coming out into the
open sea where the strength of the waves
began to be felt and the boat beginning to
heave and roll and wallow in the waves like
a sow i fell ill and went down and lay on
the nets and was soon weary of my life

  i comforted myself with the thought that
the voyage would not be long and that my
sufferings would not endure after the morn-
ing but in this i was wrong there was
considerable force of wind blowing against
the boat so that it was necessary to sail
now this way and now that in order to beat
against it the moon-faced man and giles
sweated at the great sail and a third man
of the crew that i had not seen before called
out to them from the rear part of the boat
where he held the rudder and between
times they ran back and forth across the
nets and trampled me grievously

  day came in a squall of rain sweeping
across the hills of water like pikemen at a
charge with their pikes held straight up
the bold dragoon



the ocean came into the boat over the sides
and giles set us all to bailing throwing it
out again with pails and piggins but we
were of little help for the jacobites high-
land chief and all were as sick as i was and
could but lean against the boats side and
groan and sometimes throw over a bucket
of water

  i thought to see the boats company ap-
prehensive and afraid of the raging sea but
they seemed to take it calmly enough and
smoked horrid stinking pipes and swung
their legs from the deck when they were not
setting or taking in the sail

  giles cried the leader of the jacobites
at last will we ever come to land isthere
much danger tell me for i am for taking
to my prayers if there is i have much to
answer for and it will take me a little time

  giles however being at sea and master
of the ship only laughed uproariously in
the mans face and informed him finally
that there was a slight head wind a mere
breeze that would delay them only a little
while and that they would come under the
land at sunset

  so we spent a weary day wet to the hide
with rain and salt water and at last as it
was falling dark we perceived the coast
close at hand and in a short time drew into
a bay or inlet where the sail was let go
and the boat allowed to drift the rain
had stopped some time before but it was
very dark by the time we came into the bay

  giles went into the forward part of the
boat bearing with him a lantern in a cloak
and this he uncovered twice in the direc-
tion of the shore as i could see by the light
falling on the water and then disappearing
at length when he had done this several
times far up the beach another light blinked
twice then the light went down along the
water side like a falling star only much
slower as the man that carried it walked
down a path

  when the light had gotten to the waters
edge it went out but in a little while we
heard the beat of oars and there were two
boats under the side there was some de-
bate between the leader of the jacobites
and giles as to whether the cargo should be
landed first or the passengers and there
was great argument in the midst of this
jem the moon-faced man who was in the
after part of the boat on the cabin roof
gave a great cry

  the bay ran up under the shore to a

river mouth and we could see some way
inland a great fire new kindled that
blazed and leaped and swelled brighter and
brighter giles gave a cry and ran to the
other side of the boat ere he had reached
it a second fire twinkled farther up the
coast thereat jem and giles and the third
man at once began to hoist up the sail and
the men in the boat were shoving off but
the leader of the spies called to them

  hold he roared put us ashore
we have paid for a safe landing and ashore
we shall go though all the beacons between
here and the forth were ablaze

  jump down then cried those in the
boat and this we did and each seized an oar

  i was encumbered with my sword but i
would not leave it behind and though it
cracked my shins as i got into the boat i
hung to it stoutly all four of us were in
one boat and the other being lighter drew
ahead of us and got in to the shore first
they ran in and the wind being toward us
we heard them leap out to lighten the boat
and splash ashore and then without sound
or cry at once came a great clashing of
steel and the crash of firearms

  sitting with our backs to the shore we
could not see what was going forward but
the men in our boat began to row the harder
and it turned slightly as i saw by the mo-
tion of the man who steered so as to come at
some other part of the beach we bent to
it with a will the oarsmen making no sound
but saving their breath for the work

  now a little of that labor went a long way
with me for i was still weak from my
wound and the wanderings in flanders on
an empty stomach had not helped me any
so that the sweat stood out on me and i for-
got my wet clothes in the pain of my arms
and back and when i was ready to give in
and could not even sit upright the boat
seemed to leap in air and go forward with
tremendous speed

  the man at the stern worked madly and
to my surprize the rowers backed water
with their oars as if to check the speed
again the boat shot forward there was a
great cry from ashore and a musket crack
very close at hand the man who stood in
the stern fell down among all the rowers the
boat leaped again but this time the stern
having no steering oar to hold it true swung
about and the great sea that was carrying us
turned the boat around there was a shout
and we were all tumbled into the water
ii

adventure

  i went down once drinking more water
than a fish would in a fortnight and getting
a sad rap from an oar in the meantime as
i floundered among oars and cloaks and bits
of gear and tangled with my sword and my
valise near to choking me my hand fell upon
hard ground and i found that i was only in
knee-deep water i got to my feet and had
scarce done so when a great wave rushed in
and knocked me down again but when it
had passed and i had drunk my fill again i
found that i could stagger ashore beyond
reach of the water

  there was a great hullabaloo up the
beach of steel and shots and men shouting
and as i lay panting i could hear men run-
ning through the water and pounding up
the beach toward the fight when i had
got my breath i got to my feet and put my
sword where i could get at it

  this is none of my fight thinks i
but a snarl of gagers and coast guards and
smugglers but here i am in england
again and my troubles at an end

  the fight was working away from me and
it did not appear to me that i should engage
in it i remembered that there was a path
through the marsh here where the man
with the lanthorn had come down and i set
out to find it the water squelching in my
boots and running from me in streams i
would never have found the path but that
some men ran by me and i heard their feet
over the stones and then going farther and
farther away from me so i turned about
and going over that way found the path
and followed it very carefully through a
marsh to dry land

when i had come out upon the
moor i was astonished to see
beacons blazing all along the sky
four or five of them and more
that could not be seen though their light
burned against the clouds the wind
brought to me a clamor of bells ringing and
ringing such as would hardly be if the
french had invaded us

  i began to be afraid at this for if the
country were up at our landing it was only a
matter of time before we should be laid by
the heels but i comforted myself with the
thought that i was an honest soldier that i
had my discharge in my pocket if it were
not ruined with sea water and that my con-
science was clear

  while i was thinking this i came to a

crossroad and as i thought which to follow
a crowd of people came around a turn and
seeing me standing there seized my arm
and dragged me along with them they
were armed with guns and swords and
scythes and hedge bills and a kind of pike
made of a sickle on a long pole and as they
hurried along they brandished these in air
and the bells clamored and the fire from the
distant beacons glinted on the gun barrels
and showed me their set faces

  come with us cried those who held
me well show e the way peter stiles
has been pressed got un in justice daw-

leys house well show they-lobster-

backs peter stiles that keeps the danes-
head and draws better ale than any man in
norfolk well show un

  we hurried along and coming down a little
slope saw below us a dense mass of black-
ness that wiggled and moved and showed
itself to be a crowd of men

  soldiers cried a man with us and the
men below us raised a deep shout and
opened fire

  if those be soldiers thinks i they

are - poorly drilled for their fire was

as ragged as my coat

  the party that i was with fell back into
the fields again and were at a loss what to
do some cried to go around the other
way by the newmarket road and others
shouted to go across the fields and cross the
stream lower down by which i gathered
that the soldiers held a bridge there
came up at this moment a man and plucked
me by the sleeve

  are you a citizen of these parts asked
he

  no i am not i answered i was go-
ing by about my business and these good
people prevailed upon me to accompany
them in this folly though i have not the
slightest idea of what it is about

  i thought by your look that you were
perhaps a stranger and by your wet clothes
i perceive you have been lately upon the
beach have no fear i am a man that
minds his own affairs but a word in your
ear these yokels these chaw-bacons these
apple-shakers are like to put themselves in
a fair way to be all hanged

  how so

  why marry in this manner an officer
and a corporal in the town being sorely
tried that they could find no recruits and
wishing themselves well away proceeded
the bold dragoon



to get good peter stiles who keeps the
danes-head inn most very high gravel
well-deep drunk and on his own ale
thereat he was taken before justice
dawley and enlisted as a private his
wife wailing and crying rushed about the
town and squawled that her man had been
stolen and in a short time people having
run out to the farms and outlying villages
the beacons were kindled and half the
county up to rescue peter

  well this is no chestnut for me to burn
myself dragging out of the fire said i
and at the first opportunity i must take
french leave of them and be on my own way
as fast as may be

  softly said the other man softly i
am the squire and hold some measure of
authority under the king here it becomes
my duty to put down this mob now if i
were to address them here it would prob-
ably result in a cut throat for me and the
riot go on just the same but if i had a man
to assist me though he were a deserter from
the army a french spy or a jacobite rogue
and newly landed i would give him such
a safe conduct as would take him into the
very court of the king without let or hin-
drance

  and if he did not- said i

  ah england is a small country and i
promise you that the soldiers will be here
shortly from languard fort only too eager
to hang a man such as i have described in-
deed i have sent for them this hour agone
do you have any idea what regiment the
recruiters are from

  none save that they are dragoons and
lately from germany

  well if they are dragoons said i i am
with you heart and hand to give these boys
a chance out of their predicament how-
ever there doth not seem to be much need
of us if there are soldiers at the bridge be-
low us

  they are not said the man contemptu-
ously they are another party of drunken
yokels like these about us

  here some hothead cried out that we
should charge the men about the bridge who
having fired at us again would have their
pieces empty and at that the whole crowd
of them rush down the hill the squire and
i well behind them you may be sure the
two parties met on the bridge and there was
a wild howl and a brave rapping of skulls
and very soon howls of a different note

  the party on the bridge seemed to flee
and ours was pushed ahead after a few exult-
ant cries and crossed the bridge they
climbed up the other side and my com-
panion and i were on the bridge when
there was another shout and a view halloo
and cries of hark away and back rushed
upon us the men who had crossed the bridge
pursued by the hostile party

  the railing of the bridge gave way such
was the press upon it and i being caught
on the bridge and having my arm around
the neck of a man who had been trying to
reap my head from my shoulders with a
hedge bill went over into the water where
he let go soon enough

  the water was shallow being only a
brook but so many fell in and pawed about
in the blackness and splashed and shouted
and got up and fell down that they were
soon all as wet as i by this time the bacon-
chawers had begun to discover their mis-
take and that they were fighting not sol-
diers but each other this seemed to spur
them to redoubled efforts i be as good a
man as you joe cobbles panted one near
me that wrestled and fell from brook to
shore and back again

  you be too brash for a yarmouth man
cried another and smote his antagonist in
the midst of his face i got out of the brook
and back on the road again and looked
about for the squire or justice or whatever
he was but saw no sign of him so i pro-
ceeded up the hill and across the next field
toward the cluster of houses that were out-
lines against a fire and from whence came a
clamor of bells and much shouting

in the village there was a shift-
ing mob drawn up about a fire
kindled in the street men kept
coming in continually from the
country armed in the same fashion as those
i had met earlier in the evening women
were standing on the outskirts or tugging
at some mans arm and the small boys of
the place swarmed about shrieking

  i gathered from the talk that the officers
had defended themselves in a house that
was a little apart and that the people were
waiting for reinforcements from the sur-
rounding towns ere they made their attack
i went down the street a short distance to a
corner where eight or ten men all armed
with guns stood guard and was shown the
house
n

adventure

  it was a little larger than the rest and the
windows all shuttered there was adark
lump in the road before it that looked like a
mans body and from the looks and speech
of the men on guard i could see that they
had little stomach for making the attack
as for me i wondered who was making the
house good and if they were soldiers that i
knew and what regiment they were from
it was ill that former comrades of mine
should be run to earth by such poor things
as these countrymen but unless more
troops arrived or help came from some
other quarter i could not see how they
would come free

  as i went sadly back i perceived my
squire standing just outside the first light
and so i went over to him

  this is worse than ever said he per-
ceiving me they have gotten the mans
wife out and she is to harangue the crowd
and broach a cask of ale and when they
have all gotten drunk they will attack the
house what folly is it that made these
soldiers do such a thing do they set a
recruit above their lives

  no i replied but the cost of raising
these recruits is so high and they run away
so fast after they are raised that many a
man has been ruined by being sent on re-
cruiting duty he must pay the parish
officer for the recruits feeding although the
parish is given money for that purpose by
the state and he must get him to his regi-
ment and what with this and that a re-
cruit is sometimes worth nine or ten pounds
by the time he joins

  supposing that an officer has gotten
three or four recruits and paid their sub-
sistence money and given them their shill-
ing and dragged them about with him and
they have run away in the end he is very
like to be desperate and driven to any end
to get others even to getting the landlord
of the inn where he lodges drunk and en-
listing him

  he is like to pay dearer for that re-
cruit than for any other observed the
squire look there

  some men had rolled out a cask into the
square and unheaded it with a mattock
thereat the company eagerly pressed for-
ward so that each might have a drink at
the expense of the man they were going to
save a woman who i judged was his
wife handed it out in jack and can and
harangued them bitterly the while they

jostled and shoved and spilled the ale on
each other and i began to see that this was
like to fall into a drunken carouse

  yell and shout and get drunk i sup-
pose said i and when they have got
their courage up attack the house there
is always some thirsty soul at times like this
that suggests liquor be brought out

  it was my thought said the squire i
was the man who suggested it

  you

  indeed me for when they get drunk
they will attack and if a friend of the officers
has already been in and told them of the
plan they may then escape and mingle
with the crowd and so get safely away
the country people will be drunk and the
night dark and the fight they began at the
bridge will be continued here there is
already considerable bad blood on account
of it and each side accuses the other of hav-
ing begun it look now here comes the
picket they posted at the street end now
is the time

  the men who had been watching the
house hurried by they had left one of
their number on watch but he kept casting
longing looks at the crowd about the cask
and paid little heed to the house so then
by going a roundabout way through the
fields i was able to come into the yard
where i fell over some hen-bawks and so to
the door of the house where a very stern
voice ordered me to halt

  friend said i a dragoon of ligo-
niers

  come in said the man cheerily enough
and i heard him unchaining the door i
went in into a house as dark as a pocket
and had a pistol shoved into my face while
i was questioned on the army a bit when
i was done answering the other man gave
a great laugh and clapped me on the shoul-
der

   tis hugh bancroft he cried ha-ha
i heard you were dead and gone and so
you will help us make the house good against
the mob hark to their howling

  he peered out of the back window and
then returned to me

  come in to the citadel he exclaimed
and going to the fireplace took a candle out
from under a bucket and led me into the
front part of the house

  then he turned and i recognized my old
comrade dashbaugh

  enough cried some one slay no
the bold dragoon



fatted calves here there is sober work
to your post corporal

  my old comrade hugh bancroft the
hero of dettingen lieutenant napier
said dashbaugh have a pistol hugh
i must to my watch again

  he pointed to the table where were laid
out a sword a fowling piece and a brace of
dueling pistols both he and the lieuten-
ant had a brace of horse pistols and there
was a little store of powder and bullets at
hand then dashbaugh was gone

  when my eyes became yet more accus-
tomed to the darkness i saw a man sitting
by the table his head in his hands at first i
thought this was the landlord but i per-
ceived another man on the floor smelling
most outrageously of strong waters and
breathing heavily and i changed my mind
the man at the table was probably the
owner of the house in a great fright

  lieutenant i began i was sent in by
the squire here and he hath done his best to
get the mob drunk so that when they at-
tack they will most likely make a sorry
mess of it and in the confusion you and
dashbaugh may get safely away

  i would rather stay and make the house
good said he

  i think it doubtful if it can be done i
perceive that the ammunition is low here
and there are a great many outside and
more coming in all the time troops have
been sent for and they may possibly get here
before the mob attacks

  i doubt it much said he they must
come from either the languard fort or
from yarmouth both of which places are
somewhat far distant moreover we have
this recruit who is more than stiff drunk and
i like not to have to carry him hark

- they come on look to the window

  the faint hurly-burly of cries about the
keg had ceased and instead was a low angry
muttering unpleasant to hear and worse to
think upon light began to glimmer
through the shutters and on peering out i
could see the crowd turning the corner
bearing torches and crying to each other to
come on

  my friend the squire must have mis-
judged the temper of the mob for they had
not waited very long by the keg i caught
up a pistol from the table and took my stand
at the window we heard no word from
dashbaugh and so decided that his part of
the house was unassailed the mob came

on a man in front with a gun cheering them
and as they came up to the door without
preliminary the lieutenant discharged his
pistol and the man in front fell down into
the dust those in front halted in con-
fusion but were pushed along by their
friends in rear so turned very nimbly in
among the houses on the opposite side of
the street

        at that minute up blazed up
a very great light and we heard
the crash of dashbaughs pistols
  i skipped out to the back and
found that a hay rick in the yard had been
fired and that we were taken in rear by a
party who had come across the fields and
who were firing very heavily by the light of
the rick the shutters were not overstrong
and balls came through them so that it was
very dangerous to be there in that part of
the house

  there came now another howl from the
men in front of the house which we paid no
attention to unless the lieutenant should
call for aid but continued to fire at any
that showed themselves on our side the
attackers now began to howl in good earnest
and their fowling pieces and muskets banged
away in grand style

  hold a minute shouted dashbaugh in
my ear there is some one trying to pry
the shutter on the dark side of the house

  we stepped that way and sure enough
there was a rapping and a prying at the
shutter

  dup said dashbaugh meaning open
it while i stave in his brains

  i cautiously undid the fastenings and of
a sudden threw open the shutter there
was a man there and i was just in time to
prevent dashbaugh from putting steel into
him

  here the man is a friend i cried for
i could tell that it was my squire what

now

 unhand me bellowed dashbaugh
let me split him unhand me or else get
to the window yourself

  let me in pleaded the squire so i gave
him a hand and he vaulted over the low sill

adventure

come down in two parties one to take you
in the rear and the other in front

  we know that already said i hear
the shooting we are neither deaf nor
blind

  ha-ha he cried this is the richest yet
the fools that came first fired mightily and
those coming up in the rear of the house per-
force received some of the bullets then
certain of them remembering the fight at
the bridge and having but ill will toward
those who live up yarmouth way returned
the fire calling out treachery so that they
now fight each other across the house do
your companions take off their uniforms and
wait until the rick dies out and then run and
all will yet be well

  i say corporal cried the lieutenant
coming out from the front part of the house
they are fighting amongst themselves here
is a chance for a sally

  that is just what the squire has said
i told them there is a press there and
if you can find coats to cover your uniforms
then now is the time to be gone for the
rick will burn out and all will be dark in a
minute or two and no one know who is
friend or foe

  but our recruit is drunk as davids
sow said the officer and without a re-
cruit i will not stir a foot

  this was a sad state of affairs and we
could think of no way out dashbaugh
peeked from his window again and reported
the enemy still out of sight across the yard
the officer went to the front part of the
house and then returned

  now is the time surely said he the
fire is dying out if only we had not got
the good landlord so drunk

  at this the squire stepped forward and
whispered in the officers ear

  good cried the lieutenant good
a candle here corporal

  a candle was brought and by its light the
two explored the press that stood against
the wall they had out of it two great-
coats and i who was very wet and also
cold despite the excitement helped myself
to a dry coat and a hat that would replace
the one i had lost in coming ashore and
both fitted me tolerably well

the officer and dashbaugh calling out to
me to have an eye to the window went into
the front part where i could hear them con-
versing with the man who sat by the table
i would ask you to remember said the

squire softly to me and looking over his
shoulder that when you come among your
friends of the right party that you will re-
member that it was i who sent off the coast
guard to get the troops and so your land-
ing was not opposed by more than a handful
they have been awaiting it this last week
and the traitor that betrayed the time and
the place and the fact of your coming was a
beggarly scotch viscount i should not say
beggarly for he had money enough but he
gave the information barnet is his name
and i would ask you to give news of the mat-
ter wherever you go we are not as strong
in these parts as i would wish else i would
have had his throat cut

  so he has been here has he i would
like to get hands on him i have a word or
two to say to that viscount myself where
did he go have you any idea

  none whatever he went away very
secretly by night

  crash the house shook

  they are at the door gasped the squire
the fire had died down quicker than we
thought and i had been so interested in
what the squire was saying that i had paid
no heed to the window another crash
dashbaugh and the officer began to fire
again the front of the house was being
attacked too then every shutter was as-
sailed there was a tremendous lot of noise
and seeing the door giving way i drew my
sword and upsetting the table across the
way that they would come prepared to give
them some real hospitality the two from
the front of the house ceased firing and there
was great scuttling about a hand seized
my sword arm

  put up that thing cried the squire
fooll into the press do you think you
are horatius into the press

  now his words having some sense-in
truth i was not very eager to have those
misguided people make chaff of me-i
turned and nipped into the press where we
had no sooner got and shut the door than
the door of the house broke in with a great
clatter and the shouting mob poured in

  they dashed through the room and run-
ning to the front of the house found the
landlord upon the floor and lifted him up
and made great noise and more coming in
through both door and window the press
was nearly crushed in by the throng the
other party entering by the front door
which had been unbarred they all began to
the bold dragoon



shout and crowd to the front part of the
house and the squire pinching my arm we
made shift to quietly open the door and go
out

  the crowd flowing back into the rear part
of the house a cry was raised to find out the
lobsters the bloody-minded soldiery and
worse so that they might be killed out of
hand tables and chairs were overset the
press cast down and men shouted them-
selves hoarse but the soldiers were not to be
found i was carried apart from the squire
and did not see him for a minute or two
when i beheld by the light of a smoking
torch four men in a group by the window
and the next instant gone so i believed
them all to have got safe away

  to the garret i called thinking to
raise a diversion we have not looked in
the garret

  to the garret they all roared and
straightway leaped upon the ladder but
there were so many and the weight so great
that the ladder broke and cast them all to
earth again then some of the wilder
spirits raised a cry to smoke them out and
going out into the street began to throw
torches on the roof

  thereupon we all poured into the street
again and this being a good time for me to
depart i did so and was not hindered by
any one save a man on the ouskirts of the
crowd who reached to stop me but i smote
him among his teeth and while he made
moan was gone

          i was forced to walk in the fields
and to skulk under the hedgerows
from time to time for people were
mmmmau hurrying in the direction of the
tumult and the fire but they did not see me
so careful was i and thinking that i could
do no better than to put as much distance
between myself and that ill-omened place as
i could i walked the greater part of the night
at a good round pace and when the morning
began to appear graying along the moors
and the birds to twitter and the cocks crow
lustily i crept under a rick and putting my
valise under my head proceeded to sleep
which i did until late in the day

  when i awakened it was well into the
afternoon i thought best then to call a
council of war with myself and to see what
should be done now that i was in england
firstly i drew the picinino and scrubbed
it well with sand and a bit of stone and so

cleaned the rust from the blade my
breeches were in a sad condition but they
must do and at least covered me the coat
and hat that i had come by out of the press
were not new but they were better than
those i had left and if i were not hunted for
the theft of them i might do very well with
them

  the fight on the beach had given me the
chance to get away from the spies and to
need have little apprehension at coming
upon them again the riot had been a
means of aid to us for the coast guard being
sent after troops had not responded to the
firing of the beacon and perhaps that had
been the saving of all our lives for the vis-
count having given news of our coming
they had probably mustered in force

  well then having arrived safely and hav-
ing my small store of money yet untouched
what should i do go home to my own
country in the north or go down to lon-
don and see what fortune awaited me there

  after a great deal of thought i decided
that i would go to london i had no trade
but a great willingness to learn one and if
worse came to worse then i might take ship
for the colonies in america i had thought
of going up toward the north country and
seeing what i might do by way of selling
the wadset but i found upon examination
that it was quite destroyed

  my discharge and a letter or two i had
in my valise wrapped in my extra shirts and
the whole bound securely to my shoulder by
the straps that had suspended it from my
saddle but the wadset i had put in my
pocket after leaving mr reddlefields and
so the sea water had utterly ruined it this
was not a great loss for i had begun to have
little faith in its value

  so then i would go to london and there-
upon i set out and walking sturdily came
at last to a town and an inn where i lodged
for the night the talk in the common
room was all of the mob and of the ill feeling
that had arisen between the two counties
of norfolk and suffolk on account of the riot
each county claiming that the other had
taken sides against it

  they also talked of the great amount of
shooting done by the besieged officers by
which i understood that perhaps after all
the mob did not know that when it had its
two parties attack the front and rear of
the house that each party had been firing
on the other


adventure

  i set out again the next day sometimes
walking sometimes riding in a farmers cart
and passing the time of day with every one
they were all very eager for news talking
with the good old suffolk whine but not of
the riot that rumor not having reached this
far but of french agents that had been
landed a day or two before that had escaped
into the broads beyond yarmouth and that
expresses had been through the country
warning the people about it

  i was much alarmed at this if the three
jacobites had gotten away scotfree it boded
no good luck for me and if it were found
that i had come to england in their com-
pany i might have a hard time to pass such
a thing off

  on the afternoon of the fourth day ashore
when i had been by way of tivetshall
haughley and bury st edmunds i came
out upon the highroad to london and as i
sat down to breathe the coach from the
north country came toiling along it being
up-hill at that point on the back of this
coach was a great shelf with a sail cloth over
it filled with bales and barrels and called
from the sound it made on the way the
 rumble-tumble  

  a man might ride on this for a small price
and so as the coach passed i went out and
climbed in thinking to make my peace with
the coachman at the next stage it was a
cool day the weather drawing on into the
autumn but the back of the coach was hot
being in the sun as it was and i something
fatigued with my hard walking having done
upward of seventy miles since i had come
ashore so pillowing my head upon a bale
of woolens going down to some london
merchant i fell asleep

chapter v

of a highwayman and his victims

i was awakened by the stopping of the
coach the jar of the halt and the ex-
cited stamping of the horses put an end
to what little sleep there was about me and
i prepared to get down and shake the stiff-
ness from my legs when i descended i
found not the hurry and bustle of the inn-
yard rushing stable boys the glare of links
and a cheery fight from the hospitably
opened door but the quiet of a forbidding
dingle already dark from which the road
squirmed out across the heath like a snake
from its hole reddened by the setting sun

  in astonishment i turned my face the
other way toward the front end of the
coach and there beheld the cause of our
stoppage just visible in the gloom and
crosswise of the leaders heads was a silent
horseman so placed across the road that it
was impossible to pass him

  ha thinks i here is no place for me
so i nipped into the ditch and sat me
down in the brush where i could see all
that took place and yet not discover myself
to my disgust i had left my sword in the
rumble-tumble having unhung it when i
essayed to sleep but i still had a pistol
which i had taken from the house about me
in case of need

  there was a long moment of silence dur-
ing which the horses shied and stamped and
the harness clanked and the coachman
cried-

  wo-ho dang e wo-ho

  the silent horseman sat unmoved nor
did he say aught even after the coach horses
were quiet mayhap he waited to bolster
up his courage a bit

  weel cried the coachman at last
well replied the horseman you
know what i am after well enough and
what i shall have too

  aye replied the coachman i know
a rope aboot thy dirty neck

  this spurred the horseman both to action
and speech for he began to curse and swear
but it was easy to see that he was not accus-
tomed to the art for his words tripped on
themselves and he repeated them overmuch

  light down light down he cried
waving a great dragoons pistol at those on
the coach roof and then he tried to make his
horse come up to the coach

  the coachman pounded lustily with his
feet upon the boot

  cam oot cam oot he bawled  eres
summun to speak to e

  there was a deal of sleepy stirring from
the interior then a head popped from a
window directly into the face of the horse-
mans nervous steed

  robbers cried the head with a lung-
top voice the horse shied violently and the
riders pistol was discharged in air with a
tremendous bang

  at him roared a voice from the in-
terior of the coach at him while his
pistol is empty

  at the same time the coach door flew open
and a man leaped out and flung himself at
the bold dragoon



the horseman too late the horseman
had gotten his steed in hand again and
shouting blasphemy at the height of his
lungs he smote down with his pistol barrel
on his attackers head and struck him to
earth then he plucked another pistol
from his saddle pocket dismounted thrust
his arm through the reins and threatened
the next that waggled eyebrow with in-
stant death

  now then he cried deliver purse or
life i care not which and then he had
another peg of lewd oaths to steady his
nerves

  here was no knight of the road no dick
turpin or jack sheppard but some poor
wretch seeking to retrieve his losses in
trade or at the gaming table by robbing
travelers and a very sorry job he was
making of it

 j there were lined against the
coach body two poor countrymen
who had ridden on the roof a
man who looked to be a merchant
and who was the man who had shrieked
through the window this last and the
man who had been felled by the highway-
man had ridden inside

  a slim enough bag indeed but these
were parlous times in england the roads
were poor coaches were slow and the roads
infested with thieves and robbers more-
over i had begun to hear that the high-
lands were up again on behalf of the young
stuart and there was talk on every hand
of an invasion by the french who since the
battle of dettingen had borne us no good
will consequently few stirred from their
homes except in dire necessity and then
they went with their lives in their hands
and their hearts at their teeth

  the two countrymen being on the end
of the line had first attention

  horn snuff boxes cried the highway-
man and a few farthings come -

boots you have more than this about you

-your eyes crush me for a worm but

ill have your-heart out of you what

was to pay the nights shot out with it

  the poor farmer produced at this out-
burst the little store that he had brought to
defray the expenses of the journey hardly
more than a crown or two and the highway-
man pouched it with more empty swearing
the second man had none being a depen-
dent of the other countryman the third

man was the merchant and i could hear his
panting breath as the horseman stood be-
fore him

  take heed what you do cried the mer-
chant for i would have you know that i
am a magistrate and can give you in ward
ho there he panted i call upon all
loyal subjects of king george god bless
him to gather and give aid that this male-
factor may be apprehended

  here the merchant stopped for want of
breath and the robber who had been rant-
ing and raging all this time was silent for
the same reason none of the loyal sub-
jects within hearing seemed inclined to
give aid and the robber proceeded to jerk
the merchants watch from his fob the pin
from his ruffle and the wig from his head

  where is thy gold old hides and wool
he demanded nudging the merchant in the
ribs with his pistol

  indeed i am a poor man gasped the
merchant i have no money upon me
i was to meet an express at the next inn-
you have all that i own ho all loyal

subjects-

  here the highwayman thrust forth his
foot and very dexterously swept his victims
feet from under him and so laid him upon
the flat of his back

  a hand here said the robber motioning
to the two bumpkins have off the worthy
magistrates boots i doubt me not that
they are full ofi gold blast them and con-
demn them and-his lights and liver

  the two nothing loath probably to
assist in plucking a rich man and to see one
of their betters brought low stepped for-
ward and dragged off the merchantss
boots the while he cried aloud in a most
awful maimer like a pig being stuck

  aha cried the robber i thought so
why that trick is as old as adam and
i heard the soft chink of gold now
then he continued be off pack move
remember lots wife and look not back
blast your limbs

  the countrymen scrambled hastily upon
the roof and the merchant as rapidly got
himself up the steps and into the coach
where his boots were cast about his ears by
the robber

  be off coachie cried the horseman
dy hear be off

  aye cried the coachman i hear e
lets know when youm goa to be hanged
and well ahl coom an gie e a hond


adventure

  then he shouted to his horses and the
coach creaked off into the gathering night

  a fine job indeed one that a child with a
wooden gun could have done better no
attention to what the interior of the coach
or the fore or hind boot contained just
a hurried search of the three passengers
amid a stream of curses and the thing
was over

  the man that had been felled by the robber
at the beginning of the affair still lay un-
noticed in the road and apparently the
robber had forgotten him this was cer-
tainly a piece of folly for he was probably
the fattest bird of the lot

  several times i was on the point of rising
from where i crouched in the ditch and
putting an end to all but the robber still
had a pistol and was without doubt very
nervous upon the trigger thereof so i
deemed it best to bide my time the man
was beside himself with fear and a frightened
roan is not one to trifle with

  when the coach had disappeared but
could still be heard groaning and creaking
down the road the highwayman drew what
appeared to be a small sack from his pocket
and began putting away his booty there
was a clash as the watch and seals went in
and then the chink chink chink of dropping
gold and the mans whispering as he told the
pieces

  still holding the bag he drew up on his
reins and brought his horse near so that he
might mount again he thrust his pistol
into the saddle pocket seized a lock of the
mane and was about to mount when i
arose silently from my place and stepping
into the road dragged the muzzle of my
pistol up and down his ribs

  how now said i in his ear how
now

  he fell very sickly against his horse and i
thought the man would swoon but he re-
covered himself and asked me chatteringly
what i wanted

  a watch said i to know the hour by
and a piece or two of gold to drink the
kings health

  at that he had heart again for he thought
i had but newly come upon the scene

  i am a poor man he replied but here
is all i have about me and he drew out
a horn snuff box - one of the farmers no
doubt-and two crown pieces

  when i bellowed with laughter in his
face he fell back against the horse again

  ass i roared i saw all give over
now or better still i will take it

  then i reached into his pocket and drew
out the bag here the jelly-backed robber
began to clamor and whine and tell me that
he was but a poor shopkeeper ruined by the
new taxes and that he had a wife and chil-
dren to keep

  curse a bit i advised  twill cheer you
mightily

  i prodded him a few more times with the
pistol barrel while i thought what i should
do and finally i ordered him to mount

  up said i helping him into the saddle
with the toe of my boot and in future
think not to mend your fortune by taking
to the road a man that knows no words

but-and-and -- and must needs

repeat them over and over like a child
saying his rote has no place on the heath
after nightfall with robbery in his heart
air is a poor thing to dance upon

  i slapped his horse with my open palm
and the beast leaped so that the rider was
near unseated and then tore off up the road
where the sound of his hoofbeats was soon
lost

to be continued
author of the honor of the sioux the quest of red elk etc

  i w  jhe great ponca camp on the
i niobrara was in sore distress
children wailed for food and
the stomachs of the warriors
clung to their back bones for want of fill-
ing not a buffalo had been seen on the
prairie within a radius of four days travel
on horseback for many months and the
seed corn stored in the caches under the
platforms that encircled the inner walls of
the earth lodges for next years planting
had nearly all been pounded up to make
mush or soup to fill hungry little mouths

  shunga-sabe the black horse sat on
the roof of his earth lodge smoking his
long-stemmed pipe with the red stone
bowl and watching the door of the teepee
where the soldiers lodge composed of the
chief and his braves was in council it
must be nearly time he thought for the
council to end and for their decision as to
what was to be done announced to the
people even as he gazed an elderly man
came out alone mounted his horse and be-
gan to ride about the village stopping here
and there before the various lodges to make
an announcement in a sing-song voice
presently the old herald halted before the
home of black horse

  o shunga-sabe he cried the people
are in great distress they say famine is
in the midst of us they say four brave
men four men distinguished in battle are
to go out and search for the buffalo in the
light of their experiencee they say you
are to be one of them they say

  haul ejaculated black horse hur-
riedly descending from his perch and making
for the door of his lodge to lay away his
pipe while the messenger his task com-
pleted kicked his ponys sides with his
moccasined heels and returned to the sol-
diers lodge

	the way into the earth house occupied
by shunga-sabe led through a long covered
passageway into a dimly lighted interior
within a few rays of the afternoon sun dis-
persed the gloom sufficiently to make clear
the platform that ran round the interior
wall of the building cut off here and there
by curtained bunks before the smolder-
ing logs of a dying fire lay a litter of earthen
pots and among them sleeping fitfully
was sprawled a huge wolf-like dog as
black horse brushed by to stow the pipe in
his bedding in the rear of the lodge the dog
got up shook himself stretched and ran
forward to nuzzle his master then as the
indian turned to go out he fell to heel and
trotted after him out into the village and
over to the soldiers lodge

  once outside in the clear lighta strange
thing could be noticed to the grizzled
tail of the animal was tied a single eagle
feather painted red and standing upright
it told the world at large that its wearer
was no ordinary animal for its color and
position meant two things-its owner had
been wounded in battle and had counted
first coup on an enemy

  yes gray hawk the dog was a per-
sonage of note in his community his




adventure

masters inseparable companion at home or
on the war-path he had stood over black
horses body on the field of battle and
though pierced through with a dakota ar-
row he had pulled down and killed a rash
warrior who had ventured forward to scalp
the wounded ponca therefore he was
welcome to enter even the soldiers lodge
and no cur in all the ponca nation that did
not slink away as he approached

  before the soldiers lodge black horse
and his dog halted and here they were
presently joined by three other men of ex-
perience while the people at large formed
a great circle about them wondering why
these braves had been called presently
the chief and his attendant came out bear-
ing a lighted pipe which was handed to the
four warriors in turn and as they smoked
the chief addressed them

  o warriors you who have achieved
renown both in battle and in council our
people are in danger of starvation because
of your reputation it has been decided to
elect you as scouts for the buffalo hunt go
forth each to a different point of the com-
pass and return not until you bring us tid-
ings that will make our hearts strong
again

  in one voice the four men cried assent
and with a ceremonial offering of the pipe
to the four directions to the sky and the
earth our mother they quickly left the
soldiers lodge and returned to their own
homes tarrying only long enough to catch
their ponies and picket them close to their
houses that they might be ready to start
before dawn on the following morning

  it was bitter cold and the chilly sky
was no more than pale the next day when
black horse emerged from his lodge with
gray hawk at his heels as soon as he
had crossed the threshold of his abode
black horse turned to the east and facing
where the sun would presently arise he
held up his hands in silent prayer then
he released his horse sprang on its back
and turned to the westward the direction
upon which the scouts had agreed the night
before as his quarter in which to search

  gray hawk whose stomach like his
masters was empty ran ahead alert to
every sound and smell he sensed his
own dignity and importance and did not
leap and bark like some common dog to
his keen nose the morning breezes brought
a bulletin of the occurences of the night be-

fore here a kit-fox had passed and there
a coyote a jack rabbit squatting be-
hind a ball of tumbleweed saw the dog
and the horseman go by and was conceited
enough to think that he had escaped detec-
tion because he had mastered the art of
freezing so supremely well as a matter
of fact gray hawk the veteran knew both
by smell and sight exactly where the rab-
bit lay but what was a jack rabbit to a
warrior who had slain a sioux had he
been alone no doubt gray hawk would
have stalked and pounced on the rabbit
and made a morning meal but he was ac-
companying his master on important busi-
ness and meals could wait

  as they crossed a swell of the prairie
gray hawk bristled from nose to tail tip
his nose told him that enemies had passed
but a moment before in the darkness
that still clung to the ground he could not
see the shadowy forms flit away but the
scent told him as plainly as sight that a
pair of wolves had crossed the trail

  with the rising of the sun and the flood-
ing of the open plains with light the wild
peoples sought their lairs and the scents be-
came less distinct traveling ever west-
ward man and dog passed over undulation
after undulation of the prairie now yellow
from the fall frosts and dry and barren as
any desert when the sun was mid-sky
high they halted and the pony browsed
on the sere grasses while the man smoked
gray hawk unfed and weary lolled at his
masters feet

  alas my brother gray hawk said
black horse it makes my heart sad that

i	have no food to offer you had i ever
so little the half of it should be yours it
is a pity that you can not smoke how-
ever you too are of the nature of a warrior
you do not wear an eagle feather for nothing
courage my brother if we can only find
the buffalo i shall have my woman cook
ribs and back fat for you and serve them to
you in your own wooden bowl and they
will proclaim your name as a successful
scout with mine from the soldiers teepee

  gray hawk lying there raised his head
and thumped his heavy tail until the eagle
feather danced he understood the word
for buffalo and sensed that his master spoke
of hunting them and he knew that after a
buffalo hunt there were many marrow
bones moreover his master spoke kindly
and in a tone that gave him courage so
a mans dog



he had faith and slept content until black
horse roused him and they took up their
journey once more

at night they rested in a hol-
low both sharing the same robe
the indian being exhausted slept
heavily but both pony and dog
were restless again and again the wind
brought the odor of wolves to their nostrils
-sometimes a lone dog-wolf passing along
the ridge sometimes a small pack all go-
ing westward toward morning the wind
shifted and with it came not only the smell
of wolves but a heavy scent the smell of
dense bodies of animals and a distant roll-
ing noise like far-off thunder

  gray hawk was alert and fully awake on
the instant barking and pulling at his mas-
ters hand

  hey brother what is it have the
enemy found us cried black horse throw-
ing back his coverings and sitting up

  the pony was still cropping the dried
grass stalks to the full length of his picket
rope and the half light of the dawn lit up
the hills still gray hawk barked and
pulled and black horse aware that the
dog had something to show him sprang up
and followed the animal who now satisfied
that his master was doing the right thing
trotted on ahead

  they topped the first rise and gazed out
over a vast expanse of prairie that sloped
away from them

  it was still too dark to see the objects at
any great distance but black hawk knew
the sounds that floated to him the bawl-
ing of calves the bellowing of bulls the
howl of the white buffalo wolves some-
where in the thickness before him there
were buffalol

  slowly the round red sun peeped over
the horizon behind him and with the com-
ing of the dawn a dense black mass loomed
up to the westward as it grew lighter he
saw plainly and it seemed as if all the whole
buffalo nation were gathered there old
bulls with curved and battered horns two-
year-olds with straight black spikes fat
cows and reddish calves a great herd
blackening the prairie as far as his eyes
could see

  hau brother gray hawk you have
again achieved honor cried black horse
now let us return and report to the chiefs

  in the ponca village the scouts who had

gone to the south the east and the north
had returned dejected and without tidings

  the sun was already low on the second
day when keen eyes discovered the western
scout black horse returning head erect
at full gallop with gray hawk dashing in
the lead

  in front of the soldiers lodge attendants
gathered hastily a pile of dry buffalo chips
for by the manner of the scouts return it
was plain that buffalo had been sighted and
the scout who has tidings of buffalo takes
oath as to the truth of what he is about to
tell by kicking over a pile of buffalo chips
and seizing a lance thrust upright in the
ground behind with both hands

  flinging himself from his horse black
horse sent the chips flying and with gray
hawk at his heels ran up to the spear and
catching hold of it stooped and whispered
into the ear of the old herald who was in the
act of lighting a pipe for him

  gray hawk and i have seen many buf-
falo it was morning and they were com-
mencing to graze

  hauit is very good cried the elder offer-
ing the pipe to gray hawk and then handing
it to his master black horse smoked a mo-
ment making the usual ceremonial offering
and then at a nod from the herald man and
dog followed the old warrior into the sol-
diers lodge while a great crowd of people
closed in on the teepee eager to hear the pub-
lic announcement of the find made by the
scouts a moment later when the news had
been communicated to the chief and his
councilors the old man reappeared and ad-
dressed the multitude

  o people gray hawk and his master
black horse have seen many buffalo it is
the order of the chief that we strike camp
in the morning and start for the herd all
of you remember to be as silent as possible
hunters must not go out ahead if any one
disobeys the orders of the chief while on the
hunt the soldiers will come out of their
lodge at night and beat him kill his horses
and dogs and tear his tent to ribbons

         the sun had not travelled far
on daily journey next morn-
ing before the ponca were on
x i  their way of all the people only
the aged the sick or the very young with
a small guard of warriors remained at the
village of earth lodges

  women bestrode ponies with all their


adventure

household goods and often the babies too
dragged behind on netted platforms at-
tached to poles families that were too
poor to own horses harnessed dogs in the
same manner naturally their progress
was slow and a full days journey found
them still twenty miles away from the herd
when they went into camp

  the next day the warriors gathered on
horseback fully equipped with bows and
arrows the chief divided them into two
groups of equal numbers and held in check
by the soldiers or indian police the two
parties approached until close to the herd
then they spread out and at a given signal
each band charged down on the buffalo
striking on opposite sides of the herd at the
same time

  as the men dashed in among the bison
they beat on their taut bow-strings with
their arrows and the drumming noise
frightened the buffalo who spread out so
that the trained horses might pass among
them had the herd been smaller the
ponca would have endeavored to make them
mill about in a circle but it was too great a
body of animals to handle in this manner
it required a running hunt

  pell-mell over the prairie dashed pursued
and pursuers little the indians recked for
prairie dog or badger burrows a man
must risk his neck for food always and now
there was no time for caution soon the
prairie was covered with huddled heaps
each marking a fallen bison how long the
chase might have lasted no man may say for
suddenly the sun was obscured by dull
clouds and from the north came the first
cutting blasts filled with icy particles that
herald a prairie blizzard one by one the
hunters gave over the chase hastily cut out
tongues and hump meat and raced back to
their waiting camp

  but there was no retreat for black horse
and gray hawk the indians favorite
pony had met with a mishap in a badger
hole his forefoot had sunk knee deep
throwing both horse and rider and the
indian rising shaken but unhurt found the
ponys leg was broken and mercifully drew
his hunting knife across the animals throat

  with the coming of the unexpected storm
black horse on foot and alone was too far
in advance to catch up with the retreating
riders and the thickening snow found him
and his dog deserted on the prairie

  eh brother gray hawk again do we

find ourselves in trouble but we be men
you and i exclaimed black horse and
not at all unused to the ways of the prairie
yonder lies a great bull a chief among buf-
falos let us go to him for protection

  with these words black horse ap-
proached the huge carcass yet warm and
unfrozen with a few deft slashes of his
knife he opened up the great belly of the
animal and pulled out the offal again
with his knife he hastily hacked off great
bunches of grass with which he lined the
cavity and then calling gray hawk to fol-
low he crawled into the dark interior of the
animal and there the two dog and master
curled up together safe from freezing to
await the end of the storm

  by the end of the second day the snow
had ceased falling the winds had died down
and the sun was out smiling once more the
ponca camp was again moved to bring the
lodges nearer the slain buffalo in order that
the women who had the task of butchering
the great animals might not have so far to
carry their packs of meat

  black horse and gray hawk the dog
were missing and the chief himself with his
attendant warriors were among the many
who made up the searching party

  half the day had passed without a sign
of the missing ones when the advance guard
of the warriors noticed a commotion in the
snow ahead of them pressing forward
they saw a circle of half a hundred white
wolves moving warily about some object
at the approach of the indians the wolves
slunk off some limping and as they left the
the scene the approaching ponca saw a
sight which is still spoken of around the
camp fires of an evening

  gray hawk the dog covered with blood
from a score of wounds still snarled defi-
ance beside a huge buffalo carcass while
before him lay six dead and dying wolves
slain by his terrible jaws

  as the ponca ran forward towards him
through the knee deep snow he barked a
little and managed to raise himself on his
tottering lacerated legs and wave the eagle
feather on his drooping tail but as they
stretched out their hands to him the end
came with a quiver and a sigh the great
dog collapsed and his breath passed
whistling from his body

  eager warriors hacked with their knives
and in a moment black horse stiff numb
and scarcely alive was dragged from his
adventure



refuge in the bisons belly a fire was
made and rubbed by friendly hands un-
til circulation had returned he could
speak with a broken voice choking from
time to time black horse addressed his
rescuers

  warriors of ray people the ponca na-
tion gray hawk and i were overtaken
alone by the storm and we cut open a buf-
falo and crawled into his belly to escape
freezing as has often been done by hunters
before but i fool that i was forgot to
take in my knife the carcass froze so
that i could not escape gray hawk man-
aged to gnaw his way out and would have
made the hole larger for me to crawl out by
but his ancient enemies the enemies of his
nation the wolves attacked him to get at

the carcass he gave his life for mine he
who had often risked it for me before
yes gray hawk even saved me from the
sioux in battle and thus earned the right
to wear an eagle feather and sit in the sol-
diers lodge now he is dead it is in my
heart that we bury him like a man with a
warriors honors

  so it happened that a few days later a
new scaffold was erected in the burial
ground near the ponca village on the nio-
brara and on it wrapped in the finest
blankets and buffalo robes with a buffalo
hide shield bearing two eagle feathers was
laid the body of gray hawk the warrior
dog whose passing left so great a hole in
the heart of his master that all other sor-
rows passed through unheeded

 by harold willard gleason

his desk is by a window just a streaky patch of sky
that frames the smoke of ferry-boats and squat tugs drudging by
but now and then his dim eyes glimpse a gray gull poised on high

forgotten then the ledgers dull the cobwebbed desk the strain
of deathly daily drudgery and through his eager brain
sweep images of whitecapped blue free breezes wild refrain

the magic of a deck a-slant the sting of salty spray

the witchery of moonlights gleam across a palm-fringed bay

the tinkle of a temple bell in languorous mandalay

the flash of knives in narrow streets the buzz of thronged bazaars

the rhythmic swing of chanteys roared by bronzed and carefree tars
and then-the creaking office-door restores his dungeon bars

all day he chips malignant rust from anchor-fluke and chain

obeys the will of hazing mates nerves dulled with drink and pain

and ever-luring visions pass across his aching brain

a cottage with a rose-framed door a buxom red-cheeked wife

a patch of ground to putter with a sheltered job for life

a haven from dread sun chill rain from tryant oceans strife

a corner in a quiet inn cool drink old friends to stare
wide-eyed at tales of brawl or storm clean sheets grain-scented air
the glamour of a citys streets the market-place the fair

the lowing herds at evensong the twittering lark at dawn-

and then a coarse voice hurls him back and bids him labor on   

and thus adventure calls to man-fates puppet and lifes pawn

         there

  u a voice checked the gait of

  ii	several men shuffling forth in

         the early morning

  no - drop out

  yes sir a chunky bow-legged flat-
faced man nodded answering as he slipped
from the rambling group

  youre going back today yknow
  yes sir

  the numbered man stood with his back to
a cluster of weatherbeaten tents along a new
roadway looking across at a precipice oppo-
site against the face of which was a miles-
long descending line like a scratch the
mark was a cutbank highway which led into
the enormous notch the canon entrance
miles distant and some four thousand feet
below beyond which was a wide placid
breadth of sunny green sageland of wide
rolling knolls

  the side-mountain tents were on either
hand of a comparatively shallow gulch
exit up which grew quaking aspens amid
broken stone a galvanized two-inch pipe
on x-top plank frames brought a jet of
limpid water gurgling and thrusting into a
concrete tank a wheel catching the stream
threw a pleasant fountain which rainbowed
the air with its mist a pulley and grind-
stone indicating the service of the surpriz-
ing power which it had amused and en-
grossed some handy man to construct

  apparently ignored for the time the man
stood twisting his old hat in his stubby
fretted hands his gaze following the course
of the dugway from the far-away canon foot
curving around points and turning back
into the ravines always climbing against
the enormous slope until around the head of
the canon it crept up past the camp where
he stood his steel blue eyes squinting
five hundred feet higher up it swung to the
right into top pass

  the boys were going out this morning to
clean things put some finishing touches
here and there and make it look pretty a
few had been working there ever since
spring no - had started work on
that road away back around the cape down
in the valley years before when the peni-
tentiary warden sent a few men out to
patch the old double rut climb he had
laid his pick or shovel into every foot of that
miles on miles of terrific stone that was
his road because one day some ten years
before he had fifteen cents

  exactly that in those days he was
libra cruvan and quite a man in his way
he could ride anything from a bicycle to a
wild blue roan it just happened that he
walked into cloudburst valley carrying
his saddle and other equipment he was
footsore for his horse had died under him
suffering from thirst hunger and over-exer-
cise cruvans eyes were bloodshot his

gait stumbling his hat drawn down over
one of the hardest faces west of the mis-
souri which is giving a man a considerable
of an eminence at that

  he could see some horses down ahead of
him if they were right wild his case was
apparently hopeless however he wouldnt
admit that he stooped dodged crept and
hunted among the juniper cedars among
the frost-shattered and water-rounded
stones and found a blessed trickle of sweet
water to prove he had crossed some three
desert ranges and three salt playas since
this last time he started

  he drank dozed drank again slept and
awakened at last astonishingly recuperated
considering how long he had scuffled along
on his nerve the sun of some day or other
was setting he sat up looked around and
then held out his rope a good one for a fact
soft yet little worn

  he went down into the mouth of the
gulch where he found the alluvial fan well
grown to aspens and below them junipers
he worked rapidly along with astonishing
quiet considering the boots he wore and the
shape of his legs their stubbiness and size
he was fairly creeping at the side of the
oozing water in its course passing the limpid
pools his eyes squinting his brows drawn
bushily over the hungry sunken pits he
froze suddenly for on his left he heard a
stone a small cobble rattling and bumping
on a slope

   on the instant there was a wild rush of a
dozen horses through the scattering cedars
he had been working into the breeze and
the animals had caught his scent they
were baffled by the eddying of the zephyrs
however and came dashing by him in the
part-gloom of first star-light cruvan
bounded rope in hand to a flat-topped rock

  in a moment a ghost of a horse cut past
him at top speed but scratching gravel
running low like a clawing cat with a
twitch of his wrists he drove his noose with
one hand and tossed the coil of his rope with
the other setting himself a hundred and
eighty pounds against eleven hundred
weight

  the rope came taught like a banjo string
humming and the short legs of the man
plowed two furrows on the gravel slope
the snared horse plunged and pitched
turned and dashed like a furious black bass
in green waters sport of game fish landing
cruvan had more activity in seven minutes

than a trout catcher would endure in seven
years

  when he was through he had a cali-
fornia sorrel hog-tied and gasping for breath
while he went back to find and shake the
sand out of his hat he went up after his
saddle blanket and bridle bringing them
down the valley drinking at about every
pool and finding juniper nuts in the pale
night eating them with some impatience
sometimes shucks and all

  by morning he had quite a full stomach
a saddle horse and quite a job before him
true he considered himself lucky picking
up a maverick like that having prepared
to his notion he released his captive rose
with it and was glad the animal chose to
travel as well as to buck he made more
miles in the general direction he wanted to
go during the next three or four hours than
he had during the previous week

  so he arrived in curtain a disturbance
on the sweep of the alkali beside the rail-
road curtain consisted of some seven-
teen newly painted houses a yellow red-
trimmed station and the other features of
a contract-built company-owned picked-
employe town

  libra cruvan rode along the street he
could see the mountains out on the horizon
forty miles distant and no house along the
railroad or the transcontinental highway
beside it he wouldnt have come to cur-
tain in the first place if he had known ex-
actly where he was not that he was lost
he was merely sixty miles farther west than
he had figured not having seen any reliable
landmark to judge by

   hungry thirsty dusty dead tired he saw
a pretty building with large glass windows
on a sign was the word cafe so he headed
toward it the place had six tables five
occupied for the hour was noon he took
his seat among strangers he was par-
ticipating in the function of a number of
white-collared people and probably three
fair ladies who kept the books and con-
ducted the mechanical details of corres-
pondence for the mine now being worked on
an eastern capital basis

  cruvan dashed put his hands into his
pocket and found all told two nickles and
five pennies a terrible erect young lady
in black dress as if she was mourning some-
thing and white collar and cuffs for orna-
ment came to glare at him

  lady cruvan sighed spreading the


adventure

coins from his palm and finger tips on that
polished surface lady bring the best
the most grub yo got for these here seven
coins of the realms

  our cheapest dish she snipped is
twenty cents sixty cents for regular din-
ner

  cruvan was blue-lipped pale-cheeked
and kindly eyes would have noticed he was
emaciated that his flanks were caved in
despite the significant odor of cedar which
the tiny seeds of juniper had given him

  nothing for fifteen cents he inquired
looking at the coins

  he glanced up and around embarrassed
his chin quivering he saw on all sides the
quiet smiles of culture and importance the
fat girl behind the cash register crinkled her
cheeks her eyes bright blue and com-
placent

  cruvans joints creaked as he lifted him-
self out of the chair turning to the door
had one rancher one fellow rider a gambler
or a desert rat been among the spectators
the man would have been yelled at as an old
friend or at least the friend of somebody
known to this more fortunate person as
it was they allowed cruvan to take his de-
parture he rode the buckskin down the
street to the tunnel road corner where the
trucks went up to the mine ran into the
bank and robbed it on the indignant im-
pulse of the moment

he just walked in and found a
smirking fellow waiting for the
next higher up to come and spell
him for dinner or rather for the
business mens lunch instead of a meal
release he looked into the awful muzzle of a
famous model of revolver the young man
did as ordered filling a stout pair of money
bags with wads of certificates and some
coins then curvan tied the young gentle-
man up swiftly gagged him went out to the
street and as he could ride anything select-
ed a nice bright red roadster to roll away at
fifty miles an hour

 nobody stopped him he was even
sorry he hadnt gone back after that regu-
lar dinner in the whole town of curtain
he figured there wasnt a decent man or
charitable woman he enjoyed thinking
what this town of white collars would do
with his california buckskin now that they
had him if he could have had his say he
would have hung around a while waiting to

see how they would handle the animal or
rather the animal handle them as a mat-
ter of fact they scared it and two days
later a cowboy on the pipebrand ranch
caught the horse still properly saddled
where it had come to drink at the waterhole
forty miles from curtain

  cruvan found some nice clothes in suit-
cases in the car he found quite a fine lot
of canned goods a self-cooling hamper and
other interesting things an hour later
forty miles distant he ate at his leisure and
wished hed thought to bring his saddle with
him anyhow he had lots of money but
nowhere to spend it

  he left the railroad at the first left-hand
turn he left the car with an empty tank a
hundred and eighty miles distant that night
he dined at his leisure in ely having
changed his clothes from boots to hat and
then pulled on a one-piece mechanics suit
so no one would see what he had on under it

  the ely paper said that a desperado with
terrible features and awful demeanor had
terrorized curtain held it up devastated
the nervous system of the men of the town
and rode away in mr debeaus automo-
bile cruvan grinned he wasnt much
for looks his face was hard but only hunger
had made him desperate hunger and fifteen
cents

  he picked out and bought a pair of
pants then a nice shirt with the collar
hitched to it and in the quiet of the ameri-
can hotel changed into reasonable clothes
he shifted into his pockets and two horse-
hide money belts the cash he had acquired
he took a train from those parts and in
los angeles settled down to the opportuni-
ties there to be had

  oh he was bad all right he had done
considerable mischief in a careless sort of
way at the same time what made him
mad was having fifteen cents and being un-
able to buy anything to eat with it in the
hectic days eating on central main street
gambling upstairs here and there running
down to tia juana and circling around
cruvan was still sore to think he had been
obliged to rob a bank when he hadnt in-
tended to do such a thing really he
hadnt been in a bank-robbing mood but
merely hungry

  one day when he put his hands into his
pockets and drew forth only some two
and four bit pieces and two or three crinkly
silver certificates he knew his months of
a fifteen-cent meal



ease had reached an end he had been
pretty lucky playing cards otherwise
long since he must have come to empty
pockets he walked doubtfully along the
street he eyed a number of banks and
their branches with speculative interest

  hello libra a voice remarked in his
ear while he felt a familiar grasp on his
shoulder and found his gun taking its de-
parture from under his coat over his right
hip been lookin for you

  the buckskin had been noticed and re-
membered nobody knew that particular
horse of course but the saddle on it
meant something lots of people knew that
saddle cowmen riders liverymen and so on
the descriptions given of cruvan by the citi-
zens of curtain were of no use at all they
might just as well have said he was nine feet
tall as what they did say about him but
the saddle betrayed the fact that libra
cruvan had had it made to order over in
denver in a flush and extravagant pride
some time previous that was foolish of
course but every human has a foolish streak
in him the saddler put his mark on the
leather and even on the tree and stirrups
that mark was famous naturally after
the capture of the saddled horse it was only
a question of time when they would pick up
libra cruvan asking explanations

  so they took cruvan back and con-
fronted him with the bank teller the fat
girl from behind the cafe cash register the
thin spindly waitress two of the mine com-
pany stenographers and lots of others
then they put on the stand a cowboy who
had picked up the horse with the saddle and
they mentioned the roadster which was
found outside of ely with proof that cur-
van had come there abandoning some short
pants and long nightshirts which had be-
longed in the automobile the proof was a
bit absent here and there but libra cru-
vans attorney let this go for he had hopes
of being the mine companys attorney and
the banks legal adviser at that substan-
tial justice was done according to the law

  now in the mountain canon libra cruvan
had expiated his hunger and his thirst his
recklessness and his fifteen cents his seven
months jubilee in los angeles and tia
juana he stood looking at the road his
work had built more than any other mans
the cut-bank was his contribution to auto-
mobile tourists they would ascend it
stop at the summit and stare at the sign

exclaiming to think that they had actually
climbed more than two and a half miles
above the level of the sea some of them
would appreciate the fifteen cent origin of
this contribution to their safety

  the road opened too a beautiful back
country to the coming of trucks and set-
tlers families and ranchers all kinds of
occupiers of the land libra cruvan had
plugged steadily he had hooked out some
thousands of tons of sparkling granite
porphyry sandstone and loose stuff if
that road belonged to any man under
heaven it did to him

  now and again he had glanced up to
where the peaks were silhouetted against
the sky sometimes he had glanced over
his left into the depths down the slope of
which the angular chunks of broken stone
sometimes bumped and clattered smoking
where they scraped or struck exploding
where they hit fairly

  he had seen the brilliance of morning
whiten into the glare of crystaline midday
and toward the late afternoon had felt the
sting of foreboding wind while heretofore in-
visible clouds appeared as pale rose crystal
deepening to pigeon-blood ruby speckled
with stars of many gem hues blue yellow
red green and the like he had fed by the
thousand meals in the mess tents he
knew the names of each spring where they
had pitched the tents of the convict crews
bide-a-wee dont hurry hang fast pink
posies cling fast and so on up to the
were here the water bursting down
into the tanks tinkled loudly like bird notes

  now and again one of the boys couldnt
stand the music and would go daffy but
deaf hank would cup his hands over his
ears and sit awhile each evening close up
and listening to the sweet sound that was
funny too for deaf was the blow em
boy handling the explosives with a reck-
less efficiency that seemed to show he hoped
an accident would happen seeing that he
was a lifer

  all this experience and show for fifteen
cents no matter what else no x -
thought about noticed did or lived
through he would never forget the two
nickels and five copper cents how come
he had saved the pennies he couldnt recall
the nickels were bad enough probably as
his money got slack his grip tightened
the memory of the fat girl behind the cafe
cash regi ter was dimmed to a lumpy mess


adventure

with a pink and white puff on the top he
would probably recognize the bank cashier
if he happened to see him the waitress in
her gaunt thinness remained a black widow
with white collar and cuffs and a crinkly
yellowish rawhidy neck ascending into an
indistinct face

- but even with his eyed open he could
remember exactly how those coins looked
sliding down from his finger tips three pen-
nies with their faces up the nickels showing
their buffaloes and the reflections of the
edges shining on the polished table surface
fifteen cents-

     he never did know just how
y much he carried away from the
concrete and plate glass bank
lr with its new paint smell and
shiny brass cage marble counter and floor
he just hadnt counted the loot come to
think about it he had enjoyed the money
while it lasted they couldnt take away
the good time he had had with it he lived
right well on it the sons of guns never
did get a cent back that was some satis-
faction considering the fifteen cents scoun-
drels whod have a town where theyd let a
man go away hungry because he had fifteen
cents huh

  nothing to eat for fifteen cents no
- was now going down to check out
good time among other things had favored
him obediently he clambered into the big
supply truck and went with it up to the
summit where the captain had a word to
leave with the road gang then they
started back down the cut-bank road the
prisoner thrilled as he rolled down over his
work that miles on miles of seven per cent
grade as specified surveyed and now an
accomplished dugway he saw thrilling
to every inch of the whole distance

  all for fifteen cents the convict said to
himself all for fifteen cents i was
hungry all i wanted was a snack to eat
there want no place to pay fifteen cents for
grub huh twant right

  he knew though while he was digging
the rocks out leveling off the dugway pick-
ing shoveling rolling and scraping his work
was making it right he was there to
straighten it all out that matter of fifteen
cents the idea had been growing on him
for years at first a resentful helplessness as
they told him the first time to take a pick
and go to it and then more and more

wonderingly and puzzling till now he knew
he hadnt quite finished the job oh the
dugway was done the big part of it his
own task was finished and the others were
smoothing it up prettying it and yet
there was that plaguey fifteen cents with
the cheapest thing to eat at twenty cents

  he was thinking so much about this mat-
ter that when they checked him out took
away his no - and restored his libra
cruvan name he hardly noticed the proc-
ess at all he went along the concreted
way saw the gates of heavy bars opening
before him just so they had opened to let
him in the trusty who threw the lever
to clang them shut separating him from the
open roads and the freedom of spirit now
let them swing softly to behind him far
behind him echoed for the last time the re-
verberations of that first banging and slam-
ming of ringing metal which celebrated his
conversion from libra cruvan into no
xi- he whispered his name libra
cruvan a personal possession again

  he was alone he was responsible for
himself no honor code no state criminal
statutes no sheriff or detective agency or
anybody was his boss now except himself
he had nothing else to think about but the
fifteen cents fifteen cents two nickels and
five pennies which now was his sole incen-
tive it had become an ambition a hope
and a necessity with him around it he
had built up an odd edifice an imaginary
castle so strange that had he mentioned it
any listener must have laughed aloud

  what he needed was the center of the uni-
verse casting back through his memories
which ranged from milk river montana to
alma new mexico and from los angeles
to st louis he reckoned the heart of the
world was red desert he headed for that
town on the backbone of the united states

  a beautiful place to a free mans eye
some scores of business places houses
cabins shacks and bungalows rested in a
saucer-like basin with ridges and ranges
fretworking the horizon on every side cor-
rals for beef and sheep horses and auto-
mobile tourists were there highways came
meandering down out of the mountains to
this common center a railroad led straight
through out of the due east into the due
west its telegraph poles standing black
somehow against the skyline as one ap-
proached from north or south since it fol-
lowed a kind of natural fill
a fifteen-cent meal



  libra cruvan entered red desert he
had a bag with some duffle in it he wore a
hat which had been rolled up more than ten
years he was in clothes difficult to
classify he followed sage brush street up
from the railroad to the corner of concrete
boulevard and cut across to the big bank on
the corner

  as he entered the man in the cage on the
lopped off corner glanced at him blinked
and wet his lips nervously

  wheres packy cruvan asked ignor-
ing the evidences of recognition

  in there the teller jerked his head
toward the presidents office

  cruvan found the door ajar and walked
in three men were sitting in discussion
they all glanced at the intruder and one
sprang back throwing up his hands ex-
claiming-

  my god

  why howdy cruvan another cried
springing up darn glad to see you
hows things

  all right cruvan replied rolling his
eyes at the excited man

  old friend of mine the bank president
introduced darbing of the curtain state
bank

  yuh i know cruvan grunted one
corner of his lip lifting at sight of a man so
afraid

  thats right you do packy chuckled
well old boy what you going to do now
what can i do to help want a job on my
ranch

  i want to open a caf cruvan replied
right here in red desert

  yes good idea weve a swell restau-
rant no lunch room though we need one
around the corner behind the banks a good

tight building you can have that-

  why mr delvane hes just out of-
darbing interrupted

  look here packy turned on him angrily
ive known libra cruvan twenty-five
years rode range with him

  but he held up our bank

  what made you do it cruvan packy
turned to the grim visitor

  hungry

  i thought so come on out and ill
introduce you to mr cresker

  cresker was the man behind the wicker
fence who knew cruvan well enough but
not in the way he now was made acquainted
with him

  make out a book for one thousand dol-
lars for him packy ordered drawing a
counter check on his own account to cover
the loan to ex-no - alias libra
cruvan

  cruvan for a while stood silent blinking
at the floor he reached his hand then to
shake the hand of his friend turning and
plunging out into the street immediately
afterwards he walked five miles into the
open sage returning after a time to ransack
red desert for things he needed hardware
drygoods grocery and junk dealers

for years he had listed and re-
vised his estimates and ideas
he knew what he must have
he sought nothing else he
worked all that night the following
morning but one a sign in black red and
white thrust out over the sidewalk on sage
brush street just behind the bank

good cafe grub

  three small tables a high lunch counter
with chairs and stools to match set off cop-
per boilers a fine range shelves full of
dishes and sundries as table ware and a large
refrigerator

  a burly white-aproned hard-faced man
gave a look around as he stood with his big
stubby-fingered hands on the counter he
sniffed the aroma of coffee ready and the
stove hot then he went to the front door
unlocked it and unhooked the copper screen
door beyond he backed away as his eyes
turned to one side toward the floor high
hopes were in this enterprise libra cru-
van had not always realized his most modest
anticipations now he wondered with sink-
ing heart

  but the next instant a cowboy drifted
around the corner came in and ordered a
cup of coffee with a piece of apple pie a
minute later another man a taxi chauffeur
came in then two strangers sat at a table
and the face of libra cruvan began to glow
and sweat

  a two-handed worker able to pick and
shovel right or left he was a bit awkward
he had the knack though in his day he
had cooked waited and done many camp-
fire and kitchen range kinds of professional
things besides his heart was in it
steaks beans roasts sandwiches hamburg-
ers and sausages were called for he

handled them all he did not know when
packy came sauntering in that the banker
had sent an edict up and down concrete
boulevard that he expected his friends to
do their duty by the new enterprise around
the corner until the business was estab-
lished then having seen the cook well
engaged he himself sauntered in after the
casual manner of a preoccupied man

  the bill of fare was simple at the head
was printed-

            beef soup c
ill start with the soup packy ordered
absently

  cruvan dropped his hands on the counter
staring it happened the banker was the
first man to order this most conspicuous
dish for only a moment the cafe keeper
lost the thread of his occupation and then
he reached under the counter and drew out
a new sixteen inch tray he pulled a loaf of
dry vienna bread out of a large basket
he put a two-quart bowl on the tray beside
the loaf and turned to a sizzling kettle at
the back of the range by the pipe with a
ladle he nearly filled the bowl with cut-up
vegetables two-inch cubes of meat and
thick broth he carried the tray around to
the table with a glass of water soup spoon
knife and fork and thus he served the
visitor with no sign of recognition

  the banker leaned back the better to
survey the size of this outlay he glanced
at the instantly retreating shoulders of the
man he was backing made as if to say some-
thing but didnt instead he ate a
large hungry large-capacity man packy
delvan was just able to find the bottom of
the bowl though he left over some of the
crusty bread

  he paid the fifteen cents remarking

  i believe i said id begin on the soup
cruvan

  reckon thats so cruvan replied
  well i ended on it too

  cruvan blinked grinned and then jerked
about to-well tend to something

  in a way this ended the matter in an-
other aspect the new era of libra cruvan
had begun one day the soup was beef
another mutton and again it was a mulli-
gan an irish or a fill up stew or the like
yet every day the head of cruvans good

cafe grub menu read to the music of that
old refrain a fifteen cent meal

  even though down the list of entrees
after a time one found lamb chops t-bones
porterhouse and tenderloins of sundry meat
animals and when the cafe was serving all
the fancy relishes fruits and sundries its
fame carried east and west by tourists
when the little old store was replaced by a
regular full-size restaurant with music and
even saturday night dances up and down
the wide aisles the first dish if one called
for it would also be ones last unless he
specifically demanded a plate course

  one other thing about this particular bid
for the patronage of a customer some-
times a dusty youth would come slinking in
even through the back door appealing to the
help or a cowman would seek a secluded
place and places out of sight were always
ready even in the big noon hour for the en-
tertainment of these nervous diffident
patrons if they had fifteen cents that was
all right but if as occasionally happened
some one came and asked a whispering
shamed question what have you for seven
or leven cents these inquirers found the
menu price list deceiving the fifteen-cent
soup on bid of a nickel and two pennies
came just the same and the slim young
woman behind the cash register would push
back the two cents as change she even
did that one day for packy himself when he
found he didnt have his pocketbook in the
clothes he was wearing

   notice though the cash register girl was
slim cruvan could stand a lot for he
came of an enduring school only he could
never forget that lumpy dumpling girl who
had laughed at him at curtain those years
before he tried not to have too thin
waitresses either they never were dressed
in mourning

  also only one dish on the list sold for
fifteen cents cruvan had to print it there
once true it hurt him as a memory
nothing else was bitter like that figure not
but what he was glad to have the wonderful
privilege of giving a full to overflowing meal
thus to whoever came only he could never
forget-was in a measure proud to re-
member-he had built a dug-way road for
fifteen cents

fchapter i

what allah shall send-

a

full year had passed since
mohamed ah had been forced
to exchange the dignified exis-

 tence of a moroccan basha for

the adventurous life of an outlaw with
prices upon his head since he had fled from
the city of tangier of which he had been
governor to seek safety for himself and his
family and his followers among the wild
foothills of the atlas the turn of the
same political wheel which had raised him
to the bashaship had in due course torn
him from it even as it had made a fugitive
of his venerable friend and sponsor the
vizier baghdadi

  it had been an active year for mohamed
ali allah had been kind and had sent him
many opportunities to annoy his enemies
and to defeat their attempts to place his
head above the fez gate he had tricked
the new basha of tangier and tied his
hands against any further real activity
against him he had brought ridicule upon
the leaders of the sultans troops which had
been sent against him had played two
enemies against each other with the result
that their heads both graced the city gates

  and having been captured through a foul
trick by the basha of the insignificant village
of ain dalia had escaped his prison locked
the basha up in his stead and summoned
the sultans officials with the result that the
tricky basha abruptly ceased to breathe

george e holt

  there had been various other breaks in
the monotony of outlaw life such as the
rescue of the british envoys daughter and
the securing of much arms and ammuni-
tion through the unwitting services of an
enemy so that mohamed ali should have
found no reason for complaint yet now
for more than a month he had lain idle in a
little village in the foothills of the atlas
with nothing to do but play with the
children listen to the troubles of the adults
and wonder dismally if anything would
ever happen again almost always things
began to happen when he felt this way

  now he lay upon a native carpet beneath
a great gnarled fig tree and while habiba
the little daughter of his host mustapha
played with his jeweled kumiah frowned
thoughtfully towards the west where lay
that tangier of which he had been basha
a year ago and he had ridden forth from
his house clad in the flowing white ksa
of dignity mounted upon a horse capari-
soned in silk and velvet with four great
guards to clear the way for him with shouts
of balak balakl make way for the
master then the hurried flight by night
the battle between the sultans troops and
the followers of himself and his friend the
vizier the rescue of the vizier and his own
retreat into the secure riff

  allah kerim he exploded a year
that is time enough for a dozen revolutions
of the wheel yet the sultan sits beneath
the white umbrella and offers another re-
ward for my head whenever he thinks of it
the basha of tangier is still sid omar ibn




adventure

malek the british government again presses
both the sultan and the basha towards
my capture and the french and germans
plan how the country shall be divided be-
fore they have yet seized it

  he felt a tug at the silken shoulder-cord
of the kumiah and his moody eyes fell upon
habiba a smile softened his bearded face

  ah little one he said what would
you do if you were mohamed ali and were
restless would you go forth and seek
action or would you sit quiet and repeat
the verses of the book and wait for what
allah shall send

  the little girl looked into his face with a
smile she was yet too young to under-
stand his words but with the quick sym-
pathy of childhood she touched his big
brown hand and repeated solemnly-
allah shall send

  oh-ho mohamed ali laughed our
little habiba-child becomes a prophet
he seized her by her arms and raised her
high in the air and as allah is great i
believe in such prophets another once
said a little child shall lead them and i
have observed ere this that the wisdom of
childhood is the greatest of all wisdom

therefore-

  he set down the child who ran away
laughing

  therefore o little prophetess mo-
hamed ali will have faith and will await
what allah shall send

  he stretched out pulled the hood of his
sulham over his face and shortly was sound
asleep

  an hour later he was awakened an
elegantly clothed man of middle age whose
dark face wrinkled with fun tickled the
soles of the sleeping outlaws feet until
mohamed alis great voice bade habiba
to cease lest he eat her up in one mouthful

  oh-ho valiant eater of children-and
girl children at that

  so jibed the newcomer and mohamed
ali sat up with a jerk flinging the covering
from his face and squinting at the light
another movement brought him to his feet
to grasp the hands of his laughing visitor in
the triple hand-clasp of islam

  kaid dukali by the name of the
prophet why what are you about among
these hills your place offspring of idle-
ness and luxury is in the perfumed court
at fez among the tinkling fountains and
peaceful gardens and odorous intrigue

  true enough agreed sid dukali
no doubt i would acquire more merit
did i spend my days sleeping under fig
trees my sulham- he fingered mo-
hamed alis garment-is of less costly
material than yours and as for smelling
intrigue i think i now sit at the feet poeti-
cally speaking of course of the master of
intrigue at any rate if there were more
than one mohamed ali my royal master
the sultan would assuredly abdicate in
favor of his brother whom he does not
like

  and how knew you where to find me

  kaid dukali chuckled

  oh when it became necessary to find
you the matter was somewhat simple after
all you have friends who are also my
friends but it is true that in order to be
no deceiver of my master i have been care-
ful for a long time not to ask where mo-
hamed ah was to be found or to permit
one to tell me

  he selected with care for his sheer spot-
less sulham a seat upon the carpet cross-
legged mohamed ali flung himself down
beside him it was good for good friends
to come together thus and his ears were
open for the news of the outside world which
he knew would soon be poured into them
and not dryly

  kaid dukali was known for wit clever-
ness and sophistication perhaps no one
was more intimate than he with the moroc-
can sultan the commander of the faith-
ful one of the few absolute monarchs left
upon the face of the earth wherefore wit
and cleverness and sophistication were a
mantle of protection which he wrapped
about him few men knew what kaid
dukali thought none knew what he be-
lieved except perhaps this big brown out-
law who now lay at his feet one vital
hour years before when their two lives
were not worth a grain of sand had made
a bond between them which nothing yet
had broken

  i wonder- began mohamed ali but
from a little distance came the voice of
habiba

  allah shall send she called and laughed
at her own memory of the new phrase
whereat kaid dukali asked a question and
mohamed ali explained

  kaid dukali was silent for a space and
his face grew serious then

  it is somewhat strange mohamed ali
the treasure of mulai el-hassan



he said because i think that her proph-
ecy has come true that allah has sent

  i listen replied mohamed ah shortly
and a little tingle crept along the back of
his neck

  kaid dukali reflected a moment before
speaking again

   then he smiled briefly reminiscently and
said-

  you remember the affair of kaids aisa
and brahim

        mohamed ali grinned

         does one forget the occasions
       when one has touched hands with
       death he asked

  well the matter in hand begins there

i was among those who stood near his
majesty when brahim took from his sack
the head of mohamed ah

  i heard and saw his majesty rock with
un-royal mirth

  we have here a letter from mohamed
ah said his majesty mohamed ah will
never write another said brahim but
fool said the sultan how could mo-
hamed ah write us a letter if his head is
in that sack

   allah only knows that answered bra-
him at which-yes laugh mohamed ali
that is just as my master laugh d also
but-and here comes a thing of impor-
tance-but when his majesty had some-
what ceased laughing allah kerim he
cried and if i could only catch mohamed
ah i vow by mulai hassan my father i
should make him a vizier 

  the sultan was merry rephed mo-
hamed ah and the vizier who is chosen
because he makes the sultan laugh ceases
to bevizierwhen the sultan stops laughing
true so far as it goes but the sultan
has said much the same thing to me pri-
vately since then

  but offered mohamed ah he has no
doubt said it in this form-if mohamed ah
were not mohamed ali he could be of as-
sistance to me if i were to make him a
vizier 

  kaid dukali grinned

  you are something of a sage mohamed
he said there was indeed a time when
he put it that way but later as i was able
to drop a word here and a word there he
began to think that perhaps mohamed ali
as vizier would be preferable to mohamed
ah as outlaw

  but again objected mohamed ali
that he could not possibly accomphsh
england demands my punishment many
others demand my punishment the sul-
tan needs my punishment it is a question
of the sultans prestige but come to the
meat of the matter let us have all the
facts before us

  good agreed kaid dukali in short
then leaving out of the case the various
steps leading to the present situation his
majesty beheves that you even as an out-
law can render him a service a very great
service

  if you succeed he will make you a
vizier he can then do so because your
success will eliminate those reasons which
you perceive now prevent him from doing
so

   and the nature of this service

another matter first with
france and germany almost at
war with each other for control
of morocco with france and
germany and england all intriguing and
plotting and maneuvering for more mo-
roccan interests and the agents of a dozen
other nations sticking their fingers into the
pie what my master needs is a political
intelligence service with mohamed ali at
its head and that i think is a compli-
ment to mohamed ali i think it is
a very great compliment to mohamed
ah

  hmph grunted the potential vizier
and again pimph but after a little
while

   that is not a foolish thought he ob-
served nor did it ever come from the
head of mulai abd-el-aziz

   he thinks it did

   naturally but it has too much merit
and yet-i have no especial love for
his majesty nor he for me i suspect
and for the nasrene the foreigner
has mohamed ali love for them

   no by the name of allah no growled
mohamed

  and could he prevent it mohamed ali
would see his country become a colony of
france or germany

as soon as i myself would become a
christian answered the outlaw you
argue well dukali but what can i do
this returned kaid dukali swiftly
this and it may make you the saviour of


adventure

morocco as well as of the throne of mulai-
abd-el-aziz the sultan needs money
much money france on one hand ger-
many on the other with england encourag-
ing whichever best suits her own
selfish purposes has put my master into a
corner from which there is apparently no
escape except by the making of a loan from
either france or germany such a loan
would terminate moroccan independence
if it were made from france she would
control our finances and through our finan-
ces all our affairs we would become a
french colony in a year or two germany
would be no better our lord and master
would become only a puppet in the hands of
the country which made the loan a beggar

upon a throne and we-

  he paused to light a cigaret

  we would be french or german sub-
jects concluded mohamed ali for him
and much i like the thought but why
make the loan what is the need

  his majesty obligated himself long ago
to do certain things if he fails to do them
france will interfere will use his failure as
an excuse to secure from europe a mandate
to manage our affairs for us you and
many others have looked with scowls upon
my young masters extravagance for the
past few years failing to see that it was all
a plot and a successful one on the part of
europe to bankrupt him and thereby-
he leaned forward and laid a stressing hand
upon mohamed alis knee-and thereby
to prevent him from carrying out his agree-
ments mulai abd-el-aziz is young and
not very wise and the political agents of
france and germany and england have
deceived him and blinded him and taken
advantage of his youth and power and pas-
sions and it has not been well for us but
it was a plot now having made it im-
possible for him to keep his agreements
they prepare to insist upon it or upon the
control of morocco and that -

  means sunset the final sunset in sunset
land offered mohamed ali allah kerim
but what is then to be done except to
fight i myself will guarantee to take care
of all the foreigners in the gharb and as
many more as may come

  it is not to be done that way friend of
my heart said kaid dukali it would
be like the story of your ancient kinsman
sid hercules who found that for every head
of the dragon he cut off two new ones grew

no we are too weak to fight and europe
knows it having weakened us there is
but one way out the sultan must keep
his agreements and that will take a mil-
lion pounds sterling

  a million hmph and when did the
sultan ever have a million pounds in his
treasury not in my day at least

  true agreed kaid dukali but it
must be secured

  i know a certain black magician in
tangier said mohamed ali ironically
who calls himself master of the djinnoon
perhaps-perhaps his djinnoon could find
a million sterling in the air

  no it is mohamed ali who shall supply
the money

chapter ii
trust not the sea the sultan nor the

future

mohamed ali blinked blankly in
kaid dukalis face

  i  he exclaimed i mohamed ali
secure a million pounds for the sultan
you joke if it were a thousand or maybe
even ten thousand i might find it but a
hundred times that you amuse yourself
with me

  you are wrong corrected kaid dukali
seriously as you shall see now here is
a thing which is not talked about in the
market-places nor along the highways
it is known to the sultan and to me and to
one other-and to no one else until i tell
it to mohamed ah trusting him whether
he serves us or no the sultan mulai el-
hassan father of our present lord and
master died suddenly at rabat as you
know upon his return from a long journey
through the south to punish certain rebel-
lious tribes to collect tribute from them
and further to secure what was due him
from certain great kaids who had not made
an accounting to him for several years

  mulai hassans sudden death made the
boy abd-el-aziz sultan and it also made
bou hamed regent but here is the meat
of the matter not one real of the treasure
that mulai hassan collected in sus was ever
seen again memoranda found after his
death showed it to be nearer two millions
of pounds than one million it was in gold
and jewels and that gold and those jewels
disappeared but it was not stolen mulai
hassan placed it in a safe place and died
the treasure of mulai el-hassan



  hmph grunted mohamed ali an
interesting tale but it appears that in
order to ascertain where mulai hassan hid
the gold one would needs die and go to
paradise to ask him

  almost but not quite there is a cer-
tain note among the memoranda of mulai
hassan which we think is a clue to the
hiding place

  why then do you not go and seek

   it is not a matter to be published to the
world his majesty can not go upon the
search that should be clear and i i am
no warrior and i fear death and so i
have come to mohamed ah

  mohamed ah smiled grimly

   it is true he agreed that i enjoy bat-
tle and that i am no more afraid of death
than is kaid dukali but i am interested
now why does warfare and death he
between his majesty and the treasure
because i have said that one other per-
son knows this secret yes more knows
where the treasure is hidden which we
do not know and that man is your old
enemy abd-es-selam

  abd-es-selam echoed mohamed ah
and again more gently-

  abd-es-selam

  and after a moment

  the matter becomes more plain he
was vizier of the treasury for mulai has-
san i remember and opposed both the
naming of the boy abd-el-aziz as mulai
hassans successor and the appointing by
the ulema of bou hamed as regent

  such was the case agreed kaid dukali
and being shorn of power therefore he
kept the secret of the dead sultans
treasure

  and now he plots against the sultan
and his country added mohamed ah and
his companion nodded

  but went on mohamed why do you
think that abd-es-selam has not secured
the treasure long ago for his own use
there are two reasons one is that we
have watched abd-es-selam and we know
he is not rich the other the treasure must
have been hidden in or near rabat and no
treasure has ever been taken from there
for the good reason that upon the death
of mulai hassan the people of that dis-
trict who had been punished by him became
unfriendly with the new sultan and as you
know have guarded their land jealously
against visitors who might be spies only

within a month have they again become
friends and still another reason is that
we beheve abd-es-selam is even now pre-
paring to seek the treasure we know his
movements and they point to this where-
fore it is time for us to act also

  allah yes growled mohamed ali
i should have acted before this had i
been sultan i should have had abd-es-
selam stretched out between four ropes in
the palace courtyard with a slow fire burn-
ing beneath him then i suspect he would
have told me what he knew

  no doubt no doubt fire-eater agreed
kaid dukali and the following day a
french warship would have been in tan-
gier harbor demanding that such a cruel
tyrant be deposed and at once

  but the matter could be done secretly
objected mohamed ah

  there are few secrets in the court in
these days if my master blows his royal
nose the matter is reported in detail to the
french and german and english foreign
offices-even as to the number of blasts
blown and the sort of handkerchief used
no this thing must be accomphshed in
another way and that way mohamed ah
will no doubt discover in due season

  and of course mohamed ah must re-
main outlaw in name at least offered
mohamed ah that i can see

  of course but for only the time it will
require for you to perform this task you
will have more strength in that way the
sultan will not be responsible- he grinned
cheerfully-for your actions nor will
you be impeded in any way the means
you use do not concern us nor will you
have to account for them one thing only
is desired that you find the hidden
gold bring that to his majesty and a
new career opens to you such a career
as i think will appeal strongly to mo-
hamed ali and power such as few men
have had

  as to the viziership and the political
intelligence work yes agreed the outlaw
but the matter of this task requires
thought

  but i must return to fez tonight
what word shall i carry to my royal

master

  teh his majesty that mohamed ah
will consider the matter

  and your decision

  i will communicate it to the sultan as


adventure

soon as i have decided that will be
quickly tomorrow perhaps

  kaid dukali rose and mohamed ali
with him the former tightened his belt
and offered his hand in farewell

  at that moment there entered the head
of mohamed ali an idea-hazy vague but
the possible seed of a future action

  it may be he said still holding kaid
dukalis hand that i shall desire to send
an emissary to-to you or even to the
sultan

  he shall be accorded courteous treat-
ment kaid dukali assured him quickly

  he could deal as my representative
directly with his majesty that you
could arrange

  assuredly

  for a moment mohamed ali reflected
his eyes watching habiba chasing an elusive
but friendly dog

  in that case it may be that i shall send
one whom i think you know a distant
cousin of mine who is blind of one eye and
a beggar to boot aisa the one-eyed he
is called

  i recall him because of his resemblance
to you-except for the inevitable bandage
over the blind eye

  that resemblance said mohamed ali
with a smile used to get him into difficul-
ties before he became blind and i think
that he now affects the bandage in order that
he may not be mistaken for his cousin
he has reason i grant so then it is he
whom i shall send and furthermore he
will wear upon the first finger of his right
hand the ring which i now wear the one
which was a gift from kaid dukali upon
a certain occasion

  he twisted the hand that held the kaids
so that a broad silver ring deeply chased
with the conventionalized wild roses which
mark marraksli workmanship was re-
vealed

  it is well agreed dukali thus may
we be doubly certain that nothing goes
wrong good-by then-selaama and may
allah guide your decision

  it is he who shall decide made answer
mohamed ali simply and sped his guest
upon the road

  as kaid dukalis horse stirred up a trail
of yellow dust down the hillside mohamed
ali walked slowly toward his house habi-
ba dashed from behind a giant cactus and
grasped his hand running beside him

  allah shall send she repeated but
mohamed ali what shall he send

 aha laughed mohamed ali you
have asked your father the meaning of the

new words what shall he send well
now-i think perhaps he shall send mo-
hamed ali into strange places run back
now little one and perhaps later we shall
play again

ggjl now mohamed ali was far from
fpll being a fool he trusted kaid
dukali farther than he trusted any
other man but he trusted no man
wholly who can know the heart of a man
what man is today the same as he was
yesterday what man will be the same to-
morrow as today mohamed ali knew that
the mohamed ali of yesterday was not the
mohamed ali of today and that another day
-every day-would see a new man in the
other form of mohamed ali

  this being true other men must be the
same and as it was beyond his ability
to know what changes would take place
overnight in the inner person of mohamed
ali was it not still more impossible to antici-
pate what changes would take place be-
tween sunrise and sunset in another person
wherefore mohamed ali trusted almost
wholly but not quite only as wholly as
he trusted himself which sometimes was a
great deal and sometimes not at all which
is wisdom

  now kaid dukali he trusted more than
most men but the matter needed consider-
ation nevertheless even if kaid dukali
were trustworthy even not excepting that
hairs breadth of doubt which wisdom keeps
in mind was there not the chance that he
was being deceived that dukali knowing-
ly would lead him into a trap was incon-
ceivable that dukali might be the un-
suspecting bait in a trap which others had
built there was a possibility

  it has been wisely said he reflected
 trust not the sea the sultan nor the
future we must have proper-safeguards
now in the past i have always found it the
course of wisdom to risk my head in order
to protect it if one only waits long enough
in the same place in due course the execu-
tioner will arrive with his sword it is
much better to risk it knowingly than un-
knowingly wherefore i think that mo-
hamed ali must most quickly ascertain the
truth of present matters and so bind the
the treasure of mulai el-hassan



 future that there may be no undue tricks
 played with mohamed ahs head and
 that unquestionably involves that i subject
 it to a very real risk without further delay

chapter iii

what my eyes see my head believes

 the quarters of kaid dukali were in
 the sultans own palace in fez as
 befitted one who was his majestys most
 intimate friend but each domicile in the
 royal home-and there were many-was
 independent of all the others more so in
 fact than in an american apartment house
 for while there were common avenues of
 ingress and egress each domicile had its
 own private and secret modes of entry and
 exit and as family life is much more pri-
 vate in the orient than in the occident there
 did not exist the usual opportunities to ob-
 serve what was taking place in the homes of
 ones neighbors which has both advan-
 tages and disadvantages as has the more
 pubhc manner of living to which a less
 sensitive people is accustomed

   kaid dukali was taking his ease in a
 crimson velvet house-gown lying upon
 great silken cushions and inhaling the
 pungent persian tobacco smoke from a
 silver-mounted hookah when his serving
 man mustapha announced to him that he
 who was known as aisa the one-eyed
 waited upon him

   there was that in mustaphas voice
 which clearly advised his master to let
 aisa the one-eyed wait until he should
 become tired of waiting and should go away
 and patent disapproval when kaid dukali
 ordered that aisa be brought into his pres-
 ence he leaned forward and moved the
 two tall brass candlesticks which stood on
 either side of him before the couch

    but he did not also tell me to say that
 he is a beggar and not an overly clean one
 at that which he manifestly is if my
 master desires to send him a few reales i
 will carry them to him and send him upon
 his way

    keeping of course half of the alms for
 yourself

   the shot went home and mustapha
 shuffled uneasily

   no bring him here as i have ordered
 and let us not be interrupted he is a
 sanussiyah as you probably do not know

    and i would discuss with him a question of
 a sum i wish to give to the brotherhood
 now as beggars are of an honorable pro-
 fession throughout the orient frequently
 being accredited representatives of great
 religious brotherhoods such as the sanus-
 siyah there was nothing extraordinary in
 the fact that the sultans friend should re-
 ceive one of them in his own house

   very well sidi said mustapha with
the privilege of ah old servants but
nevertheless even a sanussiyah beggar
need not smell like a fandak but i shall
bring him at once and he withdrew to
return in a moment with the beggar

   there was no doubt that aisa the one-
eyed smelled hke a fandak even as musta-
pha had said from his patched and an-
cient brown djellaba emanated the odor
of the caravanserai--that medley of smells
of horses and camels and mules of kerosene
and bad tobacco and burning dung it
hung about him preceded him into the
room fought for a moment with the power-
ful persian tobacco and overcame it quite
the nose of kaid dukali attuned to the
dehcate perfumes of the court wrinkled in
derision but his eyes were friendly as he
bravely motioned the beggar to the cushion
beside him

   your pardon sidi answered the beg-
gar but if you permit i will sit here
at a httle distance i have been ill of a
cold- he touched his breast-and for
two days have lain in the fandak of achmed
el-larbi near the north gate i fear my
clothing- an almost imperceptible smile
brushed the corners of his mouth-might
contaminate the sweet perfumes of your
own

   he squatted down upon the floor per-
haps four paces from the kaid

  hmph grunted mustapha waiting
out of curiosity near the door it would
contaminate a corpse i think

   kaid dukalis curt voice sent him mut-
tering away to close the door irritably
behind him and to gibe with his fellow
servants at the habits and customs of
sanussiyah beggars

   and besides continued aisa when the
door had closed it is quite true that i
have a cold- he coughed harshly and
went on in a hoarser voice-and i have
heard that colds are contagious

   and i have heard said kaid dukali
that one called aisa the one-eyed once


adventure

graduated from the madrissah at fez and
therefore is qualified to speak with wisdom
concerning colds and many other matters
such for example as-

  he paused and dragged at the amber
mouthpiece of his hookah

  such as matters connected with our
cousin mohamed ah the beggar com-
pleted his sentence yes assuredly i
did not come at this time of night to ask
alms wherefore-

  he stretched out a dirty hand upon the
first finger of which gleamed the ring of
mohamed ah

  that was to be the guarantee i was
told

  all is in order agreed the kaid
you bring a message from mohamed ah

  aisa the one-eyed adjusted shghtly the
filthy bandage which concealed one eye
scratched a little in the brown beard which
covered his face

  it was told to me that an arrangement
would be made whereby i should speak
directly to the sultan

  now it was kaid dukalis turn to scratch
his head to promise mohamed ah that
his emissary should be respected and
granted an audience with the commander
of the faithful was one thing to find that
emissary to be a ragged beggar smelhng
unto heaven left him in some embarrass-
ment it occurred to him that he might
array the mendicant in some of his own
clothes after giving him a bath or two but
immediately thereafter it occurred to him
that with this particular beggar he could
do nothing of the sort he looked up from
his short reverie to catch a mocking smile
upon the face of the one-eyed being a
man of wit he returned it without em-
barrassment

  your difficulty is understood said
aisa but have you not forgotten that
the sidna- he used the native term for
his majesty-has proclaimed that all
men of learning are welcome to audience
with him and being a fkee of the
madrissah of fez can not i justly account
myself a man of learning that in case
any one should see us and be inchned to
wonder

  yes that story will do for those who
may be inquisitive as to the matter as for
the sidna well he will know you for what
you are

  at least in part agreed the one-eyed

and as for the rest i am the representa-
tive of mohamed ah

  that is what i meant

  but to speak plainly with you said
aisa now more seriously mohamed ah
has told me all that he knows about this
matter of course and i do not like it i
have not mohamed ahs head nor heart
but i am afraid of this business not only
must he risk his hfe a dozen times if he
undertakes this task but after it is done
he must then risk his head upon the sultans
approval he has but one head-and sul-
tans are sultans as you no doubt know
i know well agreed kaid dukali
but also i know well this particular sidna
and who better beheve me when i say
to you that he is sincere in this that he
needs what only mohamed ali can ac-
complish he will reward as i have said
as for the risk that mohamed ali takes in
the doing of this thing mohamed ah said
naught to you of the dangers he would run
true true nevertheless i have thought
of them somewhat but the greatest dan-
ger as i see it is that once the work is
done his majesty may be forgetful and
his loss of memory will mean the loss of
mohamed ahs head

  i will place my own as hostage an-
swered kaid dukali and rose to walk
swiftly up and down the room allah
keriml he exploded striding up to the
figure squatting upon the floor you
talk as if i were trying to trick mohamed
ali while i love him more than a brother
mohamed ali has but to ask me for my hfe
and it is his does he not know this
does he think i trick him that i lead
him into a trap that i-that i-allah
no answered the beggar he does not
think as you have said that i know but
let us talk with the sidna if the time is ripe
yes let us talk with the sidna an-
swered kaid dukali picking up a white
sulham and donning it let us see
whether you fkee of the university think
that mulai abd-el-aziz boy as he is needs
aid or is trying to trick your cousin and
my friend come

  he threw back a heavy curtain revealing
a small doorway through which they
passed into a long dim corridor at the
far end kaid dukali held up a detaining
hand

  these are the sidnas apartments he
explained wait here until i return
the treasure of mulai el-hassan



the one-eyed squatted obedi-
ently upon the tessellated floor
in the posture of the beggar the
world over he had not long to
wait the door was opened discreetly and
kaid dukali beckoned him to enter he
followed his guide through another short
corridor shuffled past a heavy velvet cur-
tain which dukali held back for him and
realized that he was in a small room un-
furnished save for a splendid rug and a
divan realized rather than observed be-
cause upon the divan sat a figure swathed in
white sat with legs folded beneath him like
the buddha his hands folded in his lap
his roundish pale face was shadowed by
the sparse short black beard of adolescence
and his eyes were either deep-set or sunken
as of one who bears burdens of state or low
vitality

  the beggar observed these things in the
time it required for the four paces which
took him to the divan there to kneel swiftly
and to kiss the effeminate white hand which
his majesty mulai-el-aziz prince of islam
commander of the faithful and sultan of
morocco extended in the supreme earthly
blessing of islam

  a boy in truth thought the beggar
even as his lips felt the contact of the
royal skin and in no wise qualified to
be absolute monarch over such a people
as we are now his father mulai el-has-

  he rose at the sultans command and
again at the royal word squatted upon
the carpet before the divan and kaid
dukali at a motion from his master seated
himself upon the carpet but at the very
edge of the divan thus he was placed
between the sultan and mohamed alis
emissary

  what reply does our cousin send us
asked the sultan of dukali instead of the
beggar

  his acknowledgment of relationship was
not a mere courtesy mohamed ali came
in as direct a hne from the prophet was as
pute-blooded a shareef as his majesty him-
self and consequently cousin to ah other
descendants of the prophet

  dukali shook his head

  his emissary has not told me but re-
quested that mohamed alis decision be
given directly to your majesty but i
fear that mohamed ah is not fully assured

of our sincerity in this matter

   

  the heavy white eyelids of mulai abd-el-
aziz fell wearily over the dark eyes

  we can not find it in our heart to blame
him said the young prince in ah the
empire yes and in all europe there is
nothing but doubt or distrust of us and
there is reason there is reason

  his voice held the bitterness of disil-
lusioned youth

  but in the name of allah the merciful
from whom we plead for mercy where can
we find those we can trust disappoint-
ment after disappointment betrayal upon
betrayal treason upon treason with the
result- he drew a hand across his eyes
as if to rub away a mist-with the re-
sult that all expect trickery and deceit from
one whom they have endlessly tricked and
deceived surely allah has not set our
feet in a good road as for our cousin
mohamed ah he has aided our enemies
by making trouble in our empire never-
theless he is a man in a country where
men have become few and he is no traitor
to his own land of that we are well assured
wherefore-wherefore we had it in mind
that he might aid us

he paused wearily gazing at the carpet
your majesty began the beggar with-
out the permission he should have sought
arc tliere not still men of wit in ai mogh-

reb is the empire so poor in minds-

  there are men of wit serving the in-
terests of europe there are good minds
filled with treason there are able men
plotting against us but we stand alone
except for our good and wise friend duk-
ali- he laid a hand upon the kaids shoul-
der-and needing a man of strength of
cleverness and daring but above all one
who would not sell our empire and his coun-
try for a tarboosh full of silver-yes and
because also our friend dukali has love
for mohamed ah as well as a vast belief
in his ability which- he smiled wryly as
remembrance of some of mohamed alis
exploits passed through his mind-which
we also believe to be considerable but
now inform us of our cousins decision
your majesty believes that mohamed
ali can do this thing that you desire and
that in the doing of it he will not become
as the others

  there was no hesitation in the young
sultans reply and that small fact kept him
upon his throne

  were mohamed ah hke the others he


adventure

would not have defied us openly as he
has but would have sought our smiles
while his mind plotted against us no
our cousin is not only daring and able
but i am assured that he also loves his
country if not his sultan wherefore
we would trust him with our throne
then your majesty said the beggar
rising suddenly and straight and tearing
the bandage from a perfectly healthy and
glowing eye mohamed ali will serve you

chapter iv

truth-and what is truth

f i he bent back was gone the face was
no longer the face of the professional
beggar the mouth was parted in a smile
and it was the clear voice of mohamed all
which boomed the words and then before
the amazed eyes of the sultan and kaid
dukali had contracted to normal mohamed
ali knelt swiftly again at the divan of mulai
abd-el-aziz

  upon the sultans face amusement and
something else slowly replaced surprize
his eyes sought dukalis and found them
glowing dukali nodded his head as a man
nods who thinks that he should have known
his master nodded likewise and extended
his hand to the man who for a year had
defied him and his troops

  rise cousin he said

  and with a flash of insight as mohamed
ali obeyed the command-

  you are now satisfied of our sincerity
  i am satisfied your majesty

  and you have no fear that now-now
that mohamed ah outlaw is within our

palace walls-

  there was no need for him to complete
the question mohamed alis laugh filled
the little room

  had i feared oh sidna i would still
be aisa the beggar

  you are a man such as our father mulai
el-hassan was may allah bestow blessings
upon him

  i served him replied mohamed ali
swiftly and loved him now i shall
serve his son as best i may

  and the son of mulai el-hassan will
serve mohamed ali also to the extent of

granting full pardon for his--his-

  the royal tongue stumbled in search for
the proper word

  indiscretions suggested mohamed ah
smiling

  it will do indiscretions although that
does not seem to be precisely the word
the sultans expressive lips twitched

  but that your majesty mohamed ali
can not accept

  can not accept you do not wish
pardon for your crimes

  this time the word came forth

  no answered mohamed ah his bold
eyes held those of the young shareef no
not until my mission is accomplished
ah-h breathed the sultan his face
clearing again

  such was the offer continued mo-
hamed ah was it not so dukali that
pardon was to depend upon my success

  it was so mohamed agreed dukali
and such being the bargain went on
mohamed ali it is best that it remain so
i ask no favors your majesty even from
the sultan i think your majesty under-
stands

  the commander of the faithful nodded
we understand mohamed ah and we
do not think we would have had you do
otherwise but you have daring

  independence might be a better word
your majesty

  we accept that word also replied the
sultan so be it and thus you remain
outlaw for a space somehow-somehow
we feel the need of you mohamed ali

  it were better so sidna for reasons
which do not concern me as well as for
reasons which do outlaw still the throne
will not be responsible for my acts but
of still greater importance is the fact that
thus wih dust be thrown in the eyes of your
enemies and mine

  it is a point well made agreed his
majesty

  there is nothing further to be known by
me concerning this treasure asked mo-
hamed ali

  i have told him explained dukali all
that we know

  there is nothing else then said the
sultan we know that somewhere in
rabat the treasure is hidden that abd-es-
selam knows where it lies and is planning
to get it to use in his efforts to wreck our
empire he is a traitor he is a traitor
but as yet we can not prove it all we
could do was to bring him to the palace
as a chamberlain where we could watch
the treasure of mulai el-hassan



him somewhat but that is no protection
he plots with both french and german
hoping to become governor when the empire
shau die no we can teu you nothing more
but we are assured that abd-es-selam is
now endeavoring to secure the treasure
the matter is in our hands assented
mohamed ali it may be-it may be that
in the course of this business certain ones
will have to be removed for that i should
like the approval of your majesty in ad-
vance of the need

  it is granted leave us safe- he
smiled tiredly- leave us safe our friend
dukali and you may remove without much
danger of working injustice or in bringing
regret to our heart

  that is good commended mohamed
ali when the security of thrones and
nations is concerned one can not be squeam-
ish not to mention my own head

  and so- he rose-and so i begin
my work there is need of haste i think
great need acquiesced the sultan
there is but a month left in which to cut
the rope which europe has placed about our
neck

  the rope shall be cut sidna or mo-
hamed ah will not be here to see it drawn
taut with your permission i go but wait
i have just remembered as i waited at the
door a certain kaid andus whom i tricked
once by this same blind beggars costume
saw me and i think-i think he remem-
bered in fact i am quite sure he remem-
bered but dukali opened the door just
then and bade me enter perhaps-and
your majesty desires-it would be well to
inquire if he has-hm--done anything
inquire dukali requested the sultan
dukali parted the wall hangings and
clapped his hands the captain of the
palace guards appeared almost instantly
dukah standing so as to conceal those with-
in the room asked if there were news con-
nected with kaid andus the captain
grunted

  he is a fool sidi half an hour ago he
had the palace in a turmoil looking for a
certain blind beggar whom he vowed was
mohamed ah the outlaw as if mohamed
ali would dare come here as a blind beggar

or otherwise moreover-moreover-

  the captain hesitated dukah voiced his
thought

  moreover he told that he saw this beg-
gar with me is it not true

  yes sidi that is what he said how-
ever he found his beggar sitting at the
entrance to your quarters sidi haled him
up and investigated most thoroughly an
indecently filthy eye-bandage and a ragged
djellaba and allah remembers what else
with the sole result that he found the beggar
to be one aisa the one-eyed and not mo-
hamed ali at all after which the beggar
disappeared i know not where

  dukah dismissed him and turned a puz-
zled face upon mohamed ah who was
chuckling and thence upon the sultan
whose bewilderment was manifest

  oh explained mohamed ah that
was just a little precaution of mine it was
aisa the one-eyed you see i had him
come and wait quietly at your door my
thought being that if anything should arise
he might be useful i hope it teaches kaid
andus a lesson he should not form the
habit of seizing innocent beggars under the
behef that they are outlaws

  allah what a man exploded the
sultan

  but dukali only shook his head as one
who should never be surprized and both he
and mohamed ah bowed low as his majes-
ty lifted a hand in blessing and farewell and
dropped the curtains behind him

  on their way back to the apartments of
dukali kaid andus with two companions
approached at sight of the beggar the
kaids companions turned upon him faces
of mirth and voiced words that stung but
mohamed ah the bandage again in place
glared at him with one eye as he passed and
called down a generous curse upon him
to which kaid andus made no reply save
a black scowl and half-mouthed epithet
which brought from mohamed alis hps a
cracked laugh of mirth

  thus it is with all this little world
dukali he said we hold error and think
it is truth and when truth faces us we think
it falsehood

chapter v

allah gives me my father but i may
choose my own master

ow up to the moment that mohamed
ah came face to face with kaid andus
in the corridor leading to the sultans quar-
ters his mind was vacant of plans he had
left his feet to the direction of allah but


adventure

the incident of the seizure of the real aisa
the one-eyed by kaid andus and the
meeting between the kaid and the pseudo-
aisa gave mohamed ah a plan which he
thought would serve him for the present at
least as aisa the beggar whose identity
had been established to the full satisfaction
and chagrin of kaid andus and others he
mohamed ah would remain about the pal-
ace for a few day seeing and hearing what
he might see and hear

  alms-giving plays an important part in
the practical religion of islam be con-
stant in prayer and give alms was one of
the commands of the prophet wherefore
there is much purchasing of merit by alms-
giving and the feeding and care of beggars

  mohamed ah knew that his begging bowl
would bring him sustenance wherever he
might be and that no man in the palace
great or humble would turn away the poor
and the stranger as represented by the sup-
posed mendicant thus he would be at the
very core of things to observe and to be
guided by his observations and moreover
he would be in immediate touch with kaid
dukali should emergencies arise

  the kaid balked at the plan when mo-
hamed ali submitted it to him but after a
little reflection was mastered by the child-
like simplicity and impudence of it where-
fore

  if allah has you not in his keeping he
said he assuredly has no sense of humor

  and watched his shuffle from the room
to seek food and a place to sleep

  the royal palace is a big structure each
part connected with the others by corridors
mohamed ah chose one at random and
started down it carrying in one hand a worn
black begging bowl it mattered little to
him at the moment whither he went he
desired to think and for that purpose one
corridor was as good as another

  now the burden of mohamed alis
thoughts rested upon abd-es-selam the
chamberlain abd-es-selam and apparent-
ly no one else knew where the treasure was
hidden he reviewed in his mind the events
connected with the sudden death of mulai
el-hassan such as were known

  that active sultan had died as dukali
had said outside the high walls of rabat
city bou hamed his chief vizier desiring
to make the boy abd-el-aziz sultan instead
of permitting one of el-hassans brothers to
seize the throne had concealed the fact of

the death except from some of his own
slaves had cut a hole through the fifty feet
thickness of the city wall and in dead of
night carried the body of el-hassan to a
hiding-place in the city the next day he
had summoned the ulema or city fathers
into the mosque had then placed his own
troops at the door and had given the fathers
their choice of proclaiming abd-el-aziz sul-
tan of morocco or of being shot down as
they went out

  abd-es-selam had been with mulai el-
hassan on this last expedition and had pos-
session of the treasure collected by the
monarch from friends and enemies

  what pondered mohamed ah could be
guessed from these facts only it seemed
that abd-es-selam had known of the sul-
tans death at once despite bou hameds
efforts to keep it a state secret wherefore
at the time bou hamed was forcing the
naming of a new sultan abd-es-selam was
secreting the treasure of which he was cus-
todian mohamed ali wondered why bou
hamed as regent had not wrung the truth
from abd-es-selam not knowing that the
attempt had been made and had failed
abd-es-selam had wit but from the known
facts-

  suddenly there flashed through mohamed
alis head the recollection that the great
city wall of rabat-seventy feet high and
fifty thick-was honey-combed with rooms
and passages most of them long ago sealed
up and forgotten

  hmphi observed mohamed ali to him-
self if bou hamed cut a hole through
the wall abd-se-selam probably followed
that hole till he found a place to hide the
treasure but that is only saying that the
gold is in the city wall as there must be
five miles of walls the treasure is not yet
found and now it grows late let us seek
a patron who will give us a httle food and
a spot in which to sleep which way shall
i go down this way very good he
shuffled along yes also we must net a
few plotters along the road notably abd-
es-selam abd-es-selam abd-es- allah
keriml

  he beat his forehead impatiently with his
knuckles

  my head grows fit for nothing save to
put over a city gate or to eat with abd-
es-selam of course it is he who shah give
me food and a place to sleep for a few days

  and feeling better he strode ahead in
the treasure of mulai el-hassan



search of the lodgings of the man he was
pitted against

  thus it came about that abd-se-selam
returning somewhat late to his apartment
found squatting at his door a beggar who
at once began a husky petition for food and
permission to sleep in the hall abd-es-
selam ignored his pleas but a little later
one of the servants more charitable than
the master led him off to the servants
quarters fed him abundantly and granted
permission for him to spend the night wher-
ever he wished mohamed ah invoked the
blessing of allah upon him disposed of the
food sought a corner of the room and wrap-
ping himself in his djellaba apparently com-
posed himself to sleep

  but although his bones were at rest his
brain was not this suddenly conceived
plan to walk in the very shadow of abd-se-
selam and its success thus far at least gave
him food for thought he had gained a cer-
tain advantage and the situation amused
him but while one might pick the lock to
the tigers cage and enter it was not well
to overlook the fact that it might be ex-
tremely difficult to get out

  and that it  was a tigers cage he was
in mohamed ah had no doubt he knew
abd-es-selam and abd-es-selams reputa-
tion quite well enough to realize acutely that
if his present host had the slightest suspi-
cion that the body of mohamed ah lay be-
neath the patched djellaba of the beggar
mohamed ahs life was not worth a grain
of dust and mohamed ah rarely if ever
made that mistake which has been fatal to
so many brilhant minds he never under-
estimated the ability or strength of his ene-
my to a striking degree he possessed the
power to judge that ability and that strength
and this power was both his shield and
sword

  time passed and sleep pressed lightly
upon the eyes of mohamed ah his ego
sank slowly into the dark sea of uncon-
sciousness and then rose again swiftly as
a diver who sees danger two black slaves
had entered the room and oblivious to the
figure which lay in the shadows beyond the
light of the solitary candle-lantern began
to talk in hushed voices

  ---and if you were not my brother
i should not tell you these things

  mohamed ah caught the incomplete sen-
tence

  as it is your life is as my own and by

allah i know that shortly neither of them
may be worth a copper coin i at least
prefer to seek safety in flight and immediate
flight at that

  there is no doubt in your mind-

  the voice was slow as of a man think-
ing deeply

  doubt how can there be doubt when
as i told you i chanced to overhear a cer-
tain thing and so crept up behind the cur-
tains so that i might hear all aye and see
too there were our master and that ger-
man medico whose name i do not remem-
ber-

  langmann

  his brothers voice held scorn for herr
langmann was known for his services in
securing european virgins for the young
sultans harem

  langmann yes the name comes badly
to my tongue and so i overheard the plot
to poison the sidna and to elevate in his
place that half-brother of his who loves the
germans now the plot may succeed al-
though i for one do not desire it so to do
in that case we are safe but if it fails
and if our master be detected he and all
his household including ourselves will

quickly cease to be wherefore-

  wherefore i am of your opinion let
us seek safety we can go whence we came
and none can find us and how will they
try to take the life of the sidna

  that i do not know lan the german
spoke of a certain machine with which to
make pictures i was forced to go away
before i heard but what i know is suf-
ficient let us go and make ready

  yes let us go speedily and the journey
that our master planned-to rabat-is that
abandoned

  no we are making ready-

  the words ceased to reach the ears of
mohamed ah as the two slaves left the
room but he had heard enough to cause
him to forget that he had had no sleep
here was news for him to chew on allah
had rewarded his temerity abundantly in
truth

  and he muttered if my head was
worth little more than nothing before what
by the beard of the prophet is it worth
now this thing of getting the money for
abd-el-aziz begins to take on another color
now let us try to think what mohamed ah
can do in the present matter

  the djellabaed figure stirred restlessly
adventure

rolled over and suddenly sat upright staring
round-eyed at the distant candle light

  now said mohamed ali to himself
audibly a while ago i said that my head
grows fit only to nail over a city gate
again i say it for a quarter of an hour
i have been only thinking that i thought

  he rose quietly and slipped out of the
room then through the corridors deserted
save for sleepy guards who had no interest
in a restless beggar so long as he kept to the
passage-ways he found his way to the palace
yard and to the stables of kaid dukali

   filial

  he whispered the name into the darkness
and waited

   filial

   a little leuder this time

  the servant sleeps while the master
labors he grumbled

  then from the blackness came a cough
the sound of straw disturbed and another
voice whispered the name aisa as the
unseen speaker approached

  now when they were in the court-
yard these are the things you are to do
and the precise manner in which you are to
do them

  he spoke slowly for a httle space while
filial the negro nodded his head or grunted
in token of understanding

  good said mohamed ah at last now
go and remember that your life answers to
me for your failure

  i have never failed mohamed ah

  there was pride and a httle childish
resentment in the voice

  that is true agreed mohamed ali
but go speedily

  and he returned to the lodgings of abd-
es-selam to sleep a little and to think much
before the early sun called the palace folk
to another day

chapter vi

he who uses my name plays with my
destiny

mohamed ali found little welcome
from dukalis servant mustapha
but by reminding him with some force of
his masters words on the previous day at
last succeeded in sending word to the kaid
again the beggar entered the luxurious quar-
ters of the sultans intimate and found him
disposing lazily of breakfast

  although i might as well declare my
true self as to be seen in the house of kaid
dukah said mohamed ah the matter
is of sufficient importance to take the risk
and he told in a few words the story of
the preceding night dukalis laziness fled

  a machine for making pictures a
camera hmph they take advantage of
my masters interest in photography that
same interest which has set hah the religious
fanatics of the country to charging him with
breaking the laws of islam

  he referred to that prohibition of the
prophet against the making of an image of
any hving thing which accounts for there
being none of the graphic form of art among
the moslems

  and this machine is designed to commit
murder very well i shall see that it does
not reach the sultan abd-es-selam grows
brave and the germans desperate no i
am wrong abd-es-selam will see to it that
his skirts are clear the blame will fall on

langmann that is assured but-

  i have thought the same agreed mo-
hamed ah and the manner seems clear
he will present the machine in his capacity
of chamberlain

  you are right dukali interrupted him
and if it fails in its purpose or if that
purpose is thwarted rather abd-es-selam
will be only an innocent chamberlain who
has been tricked by herr langmann
precisely agreed mohamed ali

  but abd-es-selams slaves the one
who overheard

  gone said mohamed ali could i
stop him i am only aisa the beggar

  true again and that seems to be the
end of that string now let us see even
though we can not catch abd-es-selam in
this case there is the german to be thought
of assuredly we should be able to cause
this matter to dispose of at least one
plotter

  so i had thought

  no doubt i cannot imagine your fail-
ing to do so and your plan

  as allah is my witness i have none
protested mohamed ah such things are
not for me clean open intrigue is one
thing but this business of plotting and mur-
der and allah knows what else finds me
unprepared it is your meat dukah and
you must eat it as for me i have business
to attend to elsewhere

  he arose
the treasure of mulai el-hassan	

  allah go with thee said dukali and
as for this other matter i think i can
manage it

  no doubt no doubt as a rider manages
his favorite horse replied mohamed ah
dryly and shuffled out leaving the kaid
to his problem

 now mohamed ah had noted what
seemed to him an unusual stirring about in
the house of abd-es-selam and suspected
that it was due to preparations for the de-
parture of the master to rabat wherefore
be returned to the house and took up a posi-
tion near the kitchen where he could ob-
serve what was going on he had sat but
a little while when abd-es-selam followed
by several servants entered catching
sight of the beggar abd-es-selam ap-
proached him

  who are you and what do you here
he asked

  the beggar fingered his begging bowl
nervously looking timidly at his questioner

  i-i-manifestly the sidi has forgotten
that-that last night he found me at his
door and generously instructed one of his
slaves to give me food and shelter

  this was an untruth but the beggar knew
his man

  it is good to give food and shelter to the
poor and to the stranger so says the book

and it also says-

  perhaps- abd-es-selams voice chopped
off his words bluntly- perhaps the book
is as well known to me as to you i asked
who you are

  now did the heart of mohamed ali turn
sick for a swift moment but he mastered
his alarm

  i-i am he they call aisa the one-eyed
a sanussiyah pilgrim master making pil-
grimage to the shrine of mulai idrees at
meknez yes yes aisa the one-eyed
yesterday or was it longer ago they mis-
took me for mohamed ah ha-ha his
laugh was hke a hens cackle mistook
me aisa the beggar who has but one eye
only one eye sidi do you wish to see
where the other was

  one filthy paw touched the bandage

  no in the name of allah let it be
i have just breakfasted mohamed ah-
he broke into laughter long and loud-
mohamed ah he would feel compli-
mented could he but know ha-ha-ha
yes it is very amusing agreed the
beggar and cackled again because i re-

member seeing mohamed ali once and i do
not think he is so very handsome

  allah keriml abd-es-selam stared at
the beggar it is in all men as i suspected
but eat well then today for tomorrow my
house will be closed i go upon a jour-
ney

  perhaps - perhaps the sidi would let
me accompany his caravan as far as
meknez

  impossible replied abd-es-selam short-
ly i travel speedily so eat and go -else-
where

  he proceeded on his way leaving the
beggar throwing blessings and quotations
from the book after him but as soon as
he was out of sight mohamed ah rose and
shuffled swiftly away abd-es-selam was
to take the road for rabat in the morning
wherefore it was time that mohamed ah
arranged certain matters he had in mind
these occupied him till late in the after-
noon-his contact with those whom he had
summoned from various places had to be
most discreet-and having finished them
he was shuffling along a little street near the
meknez gate as he reached a little green
iron-studded door set in the blank white
wall the door opened a hands breadth and
a whisper came forth

  a whisper but it beat upon mohamed
alis ears hke a clap of thunder for it formed
his name his start of alarm and surprize
caused his begging bowl to clatter upon the
cobbles and in stooping to regain it he had
time to think and to cast a quick look at the
door it told him nothing but from behind
it again came the whisper louder this time-

  mohamed ah

  at the same instant the door opened a
hands breadth farther and a black pudgy
hand reached out

  enter beggar now said a voice i
wish to give alms

  this is far from good thought mo-
hamed ah but if i do not go in i shall
not know who this is that summons beggars
in the name of mohamed ah and if i do
not know i am helpless against it

  aloud he began the recitation of a verse
from the koran and haltingly approached
the door it swung open at his touch but
no one was to be seen only a voice that
urged him to enter and be not afraid

  mohamed ah entered-his hand upon the
knife concealed in his belt-and closed the
door behind him then dark curtains which


adventure

apparently divided one large room into two
smaller ones were drawn back and a big
negro dressed in voluminous garments of
black satin held the curtains in either hand
and exposed white teeth in a grin of amuse-
ment

  but mohamed ah had now completely
recovered from his shock and again was
aisa the beggar

  you summoned me to give alms he
whined and held forth the begging bowl
the negro let loose of the curtains and
strode forward his satin djellaba whispering
like a thousand spirits

  you play the part well he said and the
smile still flickered in his full round face
quite well enough to-to deceive abd-es-
selamor even your friend dukah but not
well enough to deceive the master of the
djinnoon

  mohamed ah suppressed a curse and a
httle wave of panic swept through him
this man talked of hidden matters and
what then he was no stranger to mo-
hamed ah he had visited him once in
tangier this negro who called himself mas-
ter of the djinnoon and who was also known
as the black magician and had witnessed
some extraordinary things yet afterwards
he had found more or less reasonable ex-
planations for them but now he decided
to cling to his impersonation as long as he
could

  did i not tell you in tangier that when
i desired to see you again i would send my
spirits to bring you to me i desired to see
you i sent them and here you are now
in order that we may give proper attention
to matters of some importance in order
that you may lay aside the burden of deceit
for a moment let me tell you that i not only
know you to be mohamed ali but that you
have been staying in the house of abd-es-
selam that abd-es-selam goes on the
morrow to rabat that his purpose is to
secure that which you wish to secure for
his maj-

  enough name of allah enough the
words were wrenched from the beggars lips
and in a changed voice

  then i am mohamed ali and there are
many things to be adjusted before you or
i leave this room alive

  his hand sought the knife handle and he
took a step toward the black magician
put that strange person held out a hand of
friendship

chapter vii

  the wise man avoids the unknown

that is better mohamed ali the
- master of the djinnoon was still
smihng excellent as you are as a beggar
i much prefer you as mohamed ali lately
outlaw now servant of the sultan and
vizier-to-be

  you play with death habib there
was no fear in mohamed ahs voice but a
tone of great amazement these things
are not matters talked of in the streets and
market-places how came you by them
then by allah there is treason some-
where rank treason and it lies be-
tween the sultan kaid dukah and my-
self

  you wrong ah three have you for-
gotten that i may learn all things through
my djinnoon has the matter of hadj
hosein and a certain letter which mohamed
ali desired-and which i secured for him-
passed so quickly from your memory
hmph grunted mohamed ah you
rendered me a service and for that i thank
you but i am not to be fooled by this talk
of djinnoon and magic everything has a
cause and i have spent much of my hfe
ascertaining the causes of things

  good enough said habib wi prefer
to deal with a sage than with a fool but
be seated and let us talk more at ease
mohamed ah reluctantly squatted upon
the cushions

  how do you know these things he
asked bluntly and if it is agreeable to
you i should like a direct answer

  for a long moment the black magician
gazed thoughtfully into the unabashed eyes
of mohamed ah then his own eyes closed
slowly and he began to speak but his lips
were almost motionless the voice seemed
to come from deep within him

  in the chambers of kaid dukah there sit
at the present moment four men there is
dukali there is abd-es-selam there is the
french consul and the german who calls
himself langmann

  mohamed ah shivered he felt little
chills along his back as of a cold finger
drawn upon the skin

  kaid dukali holds in his hands a little
machine i have never seen one it is for
the making of pictures upon paper kaid
dukali speaks

   my master the sultan as you know
the treasure of mulai el-hassan



is much interested in the art of making pic-
tures he says and friends who know this
often send him gifts such as this he pats
the machine this one came today through
the office of his majestys chamberlain
abd-es-selam abd-es-selam at the mo-
ment does not know the name of the giver
but my master being otherwise occupied
has permitted me to use it and so to dis-
cover accurately the manner of its opera-
tion but alas i am inexperienced with
such things can you- he addresses the
frenchman- can you operate it per-
chance so that you could take our photo-
graph the frenchman shakes his head

    i have never used one he says but
herr langmann as i know is very pro-
ficient in their use

    good cried dukali and passes the
machine to the german whose hands trem-
ble as he receives it will you then herr
langmann explain how it operates dukali
requests

  now herr langmann grows very white
and his words tremble and abd-es-selams
eyes are hah closed the german touches
the machine opens and closes it and opens
it again and swallows frequently

  this-this kind of machine i do not
know he at last manages to say

    nevertheless says dukali the princi-
ple is the same in all of them is it not i
observe readily how the plates are carried
and how the camera opens but how is the
lens uncovered to make the picture there
is that little golden tube at the end of a
rubber one with what seems to be a plunger
in it is that by any chance the arrange-
ment which makes the picture

    you-you have not tried asked the
german

    oh no answers dukali i waited for
you and now you say you press the
plunger

   yes-no-yes the german is sweat-
ing

   so was mohamed ah but he was not now
afraid only tense as a fiddle-string the
monotone of the master of the djinnoon
continued inflectionless

    do so then and take my portrait
commands dukali or better still let us
take that of the french consul he moves
to the side of the german and points at the
consul the machine in the germans hands

    now let us see you put your finger
upon the httle plunger and--

   no-no-no cries the german all
look at him but only the french consul
with amazement

  now dukah laughs and seizes the hand
of the german and forces one finger to-
wards the machine the german struggles
dukah still laughs he presses the ger-
mans finger upon the plunger langmann
cries loudly jerks his hand away runs from
the room

  allah exclaimed mohamed ah be-
neath his breath and i thought dukali
had grown soft

   the voice of the magician droned on

   what-what is all this asks the
french consul herr langmann has he
suddenly lost his reason

   no but he has lost something even
greater i fear replies dukah looking keen-
ly at abd-es-selam who returns his look
without a tremor look you at this i
invited you to come here that you might
see something that would interest you
also i desired a witness of your standing
he carries the machine to the french
consul and carefully presses the plunger
touching only the very edge a httle needle
comes out

    now observe also says dukali and
twists the top of the plunger it comes off
and shows a httle inner tube in which the
needle hes it is filled with a dark liquid
which smells like almonds

   mon dieul exclaims the frenchman
his eyes wide that-that is prussic acid
and the needle you say that camera was
sent to his majesty

  yes rephes dukah by-

he pauses a httle and looks through half
closed eyes at abd-es-selam by herr
langmann himself is that not manifest
 sufficiently so it would assuredly
have killed the sultan says the frenchman

    precisely as it will shortly kill herr
langmann assents dukah

  he is dead already growled mohamed
ah but the black clairvoyant did not hear
him

   i had forgotten that you forced the
needle into his finger he will surely die
and the german government will it not
make inquiries thus asks the frenchman

    not so long as the affair was witnessed
by the french consul answers dukali he
laughs i think you will know how to
make use of the incident-and i am sure
that abd-es-selam will be able to prevent


adventure

any unpleasant inquiries for that matter
i doubt whether any but us three will know
what killed herr langmann and it is good
that he dies he was a man utterly without
virtue is it not so-abd-es-selam

  and abd-es-selam rephes i know little
of him but i believe you speak the truth 
a deep exhalation came from the lungs
of the black magician he straightened
out of the sunken position his great hulk of
flesh had taken he opened his eyes as though
pulling the eyelids apart with a physical
effort and his dull eyes with their pupils
narrowed to the size of pinheads sought
those of mohamed ah

  clairvoyance mohamed ah answered
the question in the eyes it is marvellous
but not new i have seen it done before
and i have some learning but it was well
done and i do not doubt the truth of your
sayings however it may or it may not
explain other matters of greater importance
to me we will let those matters pass for
the present

  the head of mohamed ah had been work-
ing swiftly if this master of the djinnoon
was only a distractingly efficient practicioner
of the occult or if he was something that he
pretended not to be the results were about
the same whether his djinnoon told him
state secrets or whether he was in the confi-
dence of those in high places the sultan
dukah abd-es-selam

 mohamed ah rejected the djinnoon
theory which left him the impossibility
of choice between friends and enemies ob-
viously habib was going to stick to his
spirits and obviously he mohamed ah
could not kill him out of hand without run-
ning a very grave risk of destroying one who
was on the right side but-but there were
other things to be thought of as well

  it would have been much more to the
point he said could you have told me
something of the thing i seek

  he watched the black man closely

  the treasure of mulai hassan said
habib with a voice as matter-of-fact and
tremorless as if he spoke of commonly
known matters

  allah keriml mohamed ah shouted
noiselessly to himself

  and aloud

  yes the treasure of mulai el-hassan
where does it he

  that i do not know can not know
what men do and say i may learn but my

djinnoon do not tell me that any besides
abd-es-selam knows that which you ask
as he has told no one if my djinnoon could
tell me of hidden gold-the world is full of
it-i should own the world

  this seemed reasonable to mohamed ah
although just why he could not say how-
ever this was not the time for discussions
of the occult a matter he had been re-
solving in his head came out now better
to know what side this master of the
djinnoon stood upon

  do you know abd-es-selam

  i know him he-he comes sometimes
to consult my djinnoon

  hmph and can you send your djinnoon
for him as you say you did for me
assuredly

  then- mohamed ah paused a little
before casting his dice- then send for
him as you are friendly to me and tell him
anything which will cause him to take a
certain one-eyed beggar with his caravan
to rabat

  the black magician pondered a moment
then

  it is a simple matter and i shah do as
you ask i shall tell him yes that if he can
take a one-eyed beggar with him he will
bring him good fortune

  which will be lies

  which will be lies echoed habib but
he will do it nevertheless assuredly he
will do it for he believes greatly in luck
and in my djinnoon

 good then mohamed ah rose
now i shall go and ascertain the truth
of your vision

  go with allah said habib to his back
and added you will encounter the body
of herr langmann being carried to the
german consulate

  that mumbled mohamed ah to him-
self is quite probable if the rest of it is
true and ah the rest of it is very probable
yes knowing one single fact many things
may be judged

chapter viii

  he who has one eye is not blind

ohamed ali the beggar went
forth from the house of the black
magician with many things to think about
wherefore he did not at once take up the
road which led to the palace but instead
the treasure of mulai el-hassan



squatted in a shady spot beside an archway
composed the folds of his old djettaba about
him put his well-worn begging bowl in his
lap and proceeded to chew upon the facts
which faced him also he proceeded to
try to ascertain just what he mohamed
ah thought of himself his abilities his
judgment and his wisdom which at the
moment was not a vast amount

  hmph

  he addressed his begging bowl and such
few travelers as passed him by no doubt
supposed him to be acquiring merit by rep-
etition of the koranic blessing

  very like i am a fool i have traded
the safety of my hills and the comparative
security of open direct warfare which is
ah that is fit for a man for the dangers of
the city and its unguessed undercurrents
every step i take shows me not only that
i am in another trap but that i have just
escaped from one which i did not recognize
as a trap this is not well even though
allah-praise be to his name-has thus
far in my life smiled upon me it is manifest
that if one man demands so much of his at-
tentions that it interferes with his care of
others that man shall presently find him-
self in deep trouble and i-but who
comes here abd-es-selam abd-es-selam
of a certainty

  he held out his begging bowl a httle way
and set up the wail

  allarbii allarbil alms in the name of
allah

  abd-es-selam clad in a flowing white
sidham and riding a sleek white mule
glanced at the source of the cries and his
eyes showed recognition of the beggar his
hand sought his shakarah and tossed a small
silver coin into the air although the dis-
tance between them was a dozen feet the
coin struck fairly against the bottom of the
bowl the well-to-do moor unless he is a
miser confers many alms in such manner
each time he rides forth

  your bowl will be better filled here than
in my house said abd-es-selam here
it is best you remain

  the beggar unlike those of occidental
races paid no attention to the coin did not
even glance at it but mumbled what the
alms-giver if he heard at ah would have
supposed to be the usual blessing which it
was not

  hmph growled the beggar as the
white mule whisked around a corner i

am not so sure that such is the case how-
ever i wonder whither the mule carries
abd-es-selam is it not perfectly possible
that the black magician knew that abd-es-
selam was coming to see him asssuredly

assuredly but that in no way explains-

  he rose and shuffled along in the direction
taken by abd-es-selam until a turn in the
road brought the magicians door into view
the white mule was tied to the door knocker

  but that in no way explains a very con-
siderable number of other things he com-
mented as he returned to his former seat
one thing is certain and the certain
thing is that the master or king or sultan
of the djinnoon is a devil and one to be
watched with both eyes and both ears and
with ah the intelligence that allah has be-
stowed upon me when next i see kaid
dukah i shah assuredly make some direct
inquiries

  now the immediate question is do i or
do i not trust my head to the word of the
black magician it seems to me that for
the last few days i have done little but de-
cide who should be the next to hold my hfe
in his hands go to rabat i must pref-
erably in the caravan of abd-es-selam
where information assuredly is to be gained
but if the magician reveals me to abd-es-
selam i shah shortly be dead and covered
by a httle pile of stones beside the road
however the magician knew me and could
have denounced me anyhow therefore
having to take the chance willy-nilly it
were best that i play for the highest pos-
sible stakes if abd-es-selam-

  the white mule turned the corner the
beggar after one quick glance turned his
gaze in the other direction the white mule
clattered up and stopped

  yesterday said abd-es-selam you
desired to accompany my caravan to
meknez do you still so desire

  yes sidi yes i go to the shrine of
mulai idrees at meknez inshallah

  very well then if you wish to go with
the caravan you will have food and a
mule to ride but you must go with us be-
yond meknez-to rabat on your return
you may stop in meknez

  slowly the averted eyes of the beggar
came around to look upon the rider

  to meknez sidi whined the beggar
to meknez to the shrine of mulai
idrees and i shah ride

  you shall ride as i have said


adventure

  but-but why does the sidi wish-

  it is a whim of mine replied abd-es-
selam perhaps i desire to acquire merit
but the reason is of no importance

  the beggar shook his head slowly

  the sidi has said it is best i remain
here that here my begging bowl will be
better filled than in his house

  but that-that was before i saw that i
had a chance to perform a good deed now
i say it is not true

  there are alms to be gained here the
beggar pointed out only this morning

there have been many-

  i will put money in your bowl
  abd-es-selam grew impatient

  much money sidi whined the beggar
allah yes much money here he
took a handful of silver coins from his sha-
karah and leaning over dropped them into
the bowl the one eye of the beggar looked
at them without expression for a moment
then expectantly at the hand from which
they had come

 for another handful o generous
one-

  again abd-es-selam dipped into his sha-
karah and drew forth a handful of silver
but then he paused and returned the coins
to the bag

  come to my house at sunset he com-
manded there i will give you the other
handful and-and if i have good fortune
upon my journey there will be yet another
handful for you

  i will come sidi i will come prom-
ised the wailing voice of the beggar and for
luck threw a blessing after the rider as he
spurred his mule

  thus it came about that in the early
morning the one-eyed beggar with two
handfuls of silver in the greasy shakarah
under his ancient djellaba rode a flea-bitten
steel-jawed mule in the caravan of abd-es-
selam en route to rabat the red

  and although as he rode the one-eyed
tried to think upon pleasant matters he felt
very profoundly that both the activities of
a certain mohamed ah and the proposed
coup detat of his majesty the sultan per-
haps the fate of the shareefian empire it-
self depended upon one very small matter
did abd-es-selam know the beggar was not
blind in one eye had the black magician
betrayed him

  mohamed ah would have given his black
beard to know

chapter ix

he who rides through a gate at least
finds himself on the other side the
wall

detween fez among the hills and
rabat upon the coast lies a hundred
miles or more of wild and rough country
a score of miles west of fez is meknez the
old capital of the empire and then are no
more cities no more towns few villages un-
til the mouth of the bu regreg river the
trail leads to the twin towns of rabat-sallee

  the road-and it can scarcely be called
that most of the time-runs almost entirely
in the great province of zemmur and this is
a restless province running up almost to
the city gates of fez more than one sultan
has found it a harsh task to control its tur-
bulent independent people and more than
one monarch too has found it impossible
rabat and sallee have always excluded the
foreigner knowing that inevitably trouble
followed in the footsteps of the christian

  sallee the home and last defense of the
far-famed sallee pirates has never been
more antagonistic to the nasrene than has
rabat its sister city lying upon the south
bank of the bu regreg and both have
fought incessantly the modern ideas and
modern methods knowing that all things
modern come from other lands and quoting
eternally to themselves what is is best
as a consequence there was to be found
in rabat a moroccan life unveneered by
foreign thought-and customs untarnished
by contact with such infidel cities as tan-
gier and fez where the people bore most
lightly the yoke of voluntary allegiance to
the sultan not because he was their king
but because he was their religious head
ready to throw it off in a moment of resent-
ment and close their provinces and their city
gates to the whole world even as they had
closed them after mulai el-hassan had died

  the caravan of abd-es-selam did not take
the road until long after sunrise and dark-
ness found it established for the night in a
fandak at meknez from the rate of prog-
ress thus established it was manifest that
at least four days would pass ere abd-es-
selam slept in rabat

  the caravan was not a big one abd-es-
selam rode at its head near to him two
of his personal servants then the chief mule-
teer followed by half a dozen pack ani-
mals lightly laden and serving as mounts
the treasure of mulai el-hassan



for the servants of abd-es-selam and
last of all squatting hke all the others in a
big red-cloth saddle upon a mule abd-es-
selams invited guest the one-eyed beggar

  now came four days of disappointment to
mohamed ah for four days he kept his
eyes and ears open and saw and heard
nothing of importance for three nights
he squatted with the servants about their
camp fires and hstened to interminable talk
but heard no word which might aid him
as a result of which he rode through the
fez gate of rabat knowing no more than
he had known when he left the capital
except perhaps that abd-es-selam did not
suspect him to be aught save the one-eyed
mendicant who was to bring him luck

  so mohamed ah rode into rabat in the
golden glow of a summer sunset knowing
just what he had known four days before
and highly dissatisfied with that knowledge

  but he consoled himself with a prov-
erb he who rides through a gate at least
finds himself on the other side the wall
and added for good measure the one which
runs expect not the results of a journey
until the journey is ended

  and as it was ordained various equations
in the scheme of things were awaiting mo-
hamed alis arrival in rabat

  but for the next hour he squatted in a
corner of the big fandak watching the camp-
fires spring into life following with his eyes
the passage of candle-lanterns hither and
thither listening to the innumerable noises
of the caravanserai and sniffing with the
real criticism of hunger the odors which
arose from the bubbling cooking pots

  eventually he rose and took a position
near one of the camp-fires and to him
shortly came a servant bearing a big bowl
of kesksoo and baked chicken into which
he plunged his hand with the universal
grace of islam

  bismillah in the name of allah

  after a little while having cleaned the
bowl and hcked each finger in the order pre-
scribed by moslem convention he arose
adjusted the bandage over his eye a trifle
and shuffled through the fandak gate and
into a star-studded velvet darkness

  he had gone but a dozen paces beyond
the gate when a dark shadow detached it-
self from the darker shadow of the fandak
wall and followed him silently the faint
hght of the stars revealed that the figure
wore a dirty white bandage over one eye

precisely the same as that worn by mo-
hamed ah and the glint upon a shiny
begging bowl marked him also as a mendi-
cant

  to him mohamed ah paid no attention
for a space seemed not to hear him but
having gotten well away from the fandak
lights he stopped and whirled suddenly an
automatic pistol in his hand but he put it
away quickly and somewhat sheepishly
when he saw the bandaged head of his
pursuer

  aisa he said softly

  go on go on commanded aisa the
one-eyed i follow we are yet too
near

  mohamed ah led on around a corner and
came to a row of closed dark stores on an
almost deserted street there he stopped
and squatted down against a wall and placed
his begging bowl in his lap aisa coming
up a moment later did likewise

  and now said mohamed ali let us
talk or rather as i have nothing to say
let me listen to what you can tell me
what i know is not much but it may
have a value nevertheless

  aisa hitched his djellaba closer about him
the night air grew chilly

  i followed your instructions of course
there are now here in rabat the twelve good
men you desired should be prepared they
are ah from your own villages in anjerah
and mustapha is in command of them
that is well observed mohamed ah
there may be need for them although so
far the game has been played with wits in-
stead of guns and they he where
mustapha may always be found in the
coffee-house of achmed larbi opposite the
great mosque now this i have learned
and this only abd-es-selam has recently
within a month begun a business here that
of buying and selling dates figs nuts grain
and other products of the south his two
brothers are in charge of this business and
they are said to be not only brave men but
loyal to abd-es-selam which is a strange
thing for brothers

  now i come to the meat of the matter
i think abd-es-selam and his brothers
have caused to be built against the city wall
and perhaps two hundred paces south of the
fassi gate a big storehouse a storehouse
twice as big as any other in rabat to
this have been coming for some weeks
many caravans with grain and dates and


adventure

other things the story is abroad that they
send a great caravan of goods to some north-
ern port for shipment to europe the bar
at the river mouth here as you are aware
makes it always dangerous and expensive
and most times impossible to ship by sea
from here and that is ah i know he con-
cluded simply

j mohamed ali was silent for
       a space then

          that storehouse against the city
wall is a matter of interest to
me as is also the great caravan going
north to say nothing of the two loyal
brothers hmph you have done well
aisa i think i begin to see the plan if
as may be the case abd-es-selam would
follow somewhat the hnes which i would
follow in similar circumstances and have
you ascertained where the hole was cut
through the wall by bou hamed

  ah yes that i had fogotten it was
near the southeastern corner of the wall
near abd-es-selams new building
no mohamed not near perhaps two
hundred yards away

  near enough near enough if the
wall is hollow yes i begin to see and
now there is one other with whom i would
talk know you of a maker of sacks of the
sort that grain is carried in

  there is one not far away the only one
in rabat it is said and i beheve he works
tonight at least he was still working by
candle-light as i came toward the fandak
he leaned forward and wrinkled up his face
in a squint yes you can see the light in
his shop i think at the far end of this same
street i think that must be his light

  i go said mohamed ah but stop
there is one other thing there must not
be two one-eyed beggars in rabat just now
at least not two who resemble each other in
several ways therefore do you bandage
both your eyes it will not interfere with
your sight the trick is bent with age
swiftly aisa pulled the bandage around
his head so that both eyes seemed to be
covered

  good approved mohamed ah and
now watch my comings and goings as best
you may and be as often near the storehouse
of abd-es-selam as you can arrange do
that which is the obvious thing to do in
case i can not give an order selaama
he shuffled swiftly toward the light in

the distance and soon came to a tiny shop
wherein sat a gray-beard busily engaged in
sewing sacks beside him stood a steaming
pot of tea at the sound of slippers the
worker looked up and saw the beggar look-
ing with his unbandaged eye at the tea-pot

  the grace of allah upon you invoked
the beggar

  and upon you also rephed the bag-
maker and being a man of generous heart
he added

  sit you down here upon my doorway and
drink a cup of tea it is lonely here but i
have work which must be done

  mohamed ah sat down in the doorway
and sipped slowly at the tea

  ah-h he breathed that is good tea
it is good for a beggars heart may allah
bless thee again but why is it necessary to
work two days in one

  there is work to do and i need the
money the khalifa has increased the tax
on this httle shop until the sun no longer
gives light enough to pay it with and so
as sid abd-es-selam- drink your tea
quickly it will warm you and your hands
will not shake- as sid abd-es-selam the
merchant desired two hundred bags by

daybreak-

  a shrug completed the sentence

  two hundred that is a great many is
it not

  yes to be made in a day and a night
especially as they are not to be ah of the
same size one hundred and fifty of them
are grain sacks of the usual size the
others are to be of canvas for dried dates
now as ah the world knows- the gray-
beard grew loquacious and sipped his tea
slowly despite the piles of material awaiting
the cutting and sewing- now as all the
world knows dates are always transported
in sacks of a certain size

  i had a hundred such sacks already
made but they would not serve no
the sacks had to be four inches longer than
the usual size wealth i think makes
people queer abd-es-selam could have
saved a handful of silver if he had bought
the bags which were already made but
no four inches longer they must be and
in that four inches he can get not more than
a kilo of dates it is foolishness

  no doubt no doubt agreed mohamed
ah but there is no accounting for the
madness of the rich as you say

  see here
the treasure of mulai el-hassan



  the bag-maker hipped a canvas sack upon
the ground at his feet and stretched another
beside it four inches only one could
never tell the difference

  that is true responded mohamed ah
slowly that is very true one could
never tell the difference

  he drained his cup smacked his lips
belched generously in the oriental- mode of
expressing appreciation of food and drink
and leaving graybeard sewing and grum-
bling shuffled back to the fandak to sleep

chapter x
though the ups are silent the head

may labor

aylight brought the fandak to its
feet to make loud and multitudinous
noises in the business of breaking fast of
man and beast the beggar who slept in a
corner of the wall was awake with the fore-
most but continued to he quiet in the hope
of overhearing something which might give
him a clue to abd-es-selams plans al-
though in truth he believed that he
already knew enough of them to act
upon

  this behef was strengthened when he
caught snatches of a talk between the chief
muleteer and one of his men

  abd-es-selam desires only the swiftest
animals remember the muleteer was say-
ing and of those we brought there are
not more than half a dozen which are good
enough

  he pointed out a number of the animals
and moved off to inspect them

  now this speech had considerable sig-
nificance beasts of burden were not ordi-
narily selected for their speed therefore
some one was going somewhere in haste
the beasts laden somewhat more
lightly than usual and the meat of this
was that inasmuch as one does not rush
madly with a cargo of grain or dates or
other such stuff these swift mules must be
going somewhere with a burden which might
well bear investigation

  wherefore having warmed his belly with
alassful of very black and very thick and
ery powerful coffee the beggar went shuf-
fling forth from the fandak to seek the store-
house of abd-es-selam and his brothers
near the storehouse he saw a beggar squat-
ting in the morning sun a bandage con-

cealing both eyes mohamed ah passed
him with a greeting

  and upon you be the peace of allah
also replied the sightless one there is
much activity over yonder alms in the
name of allah the compassionate

  watch well today the one-eyed
threw this over his shoulder and remain
near by

  at the storehouse there was great action
even as aisa had said all about were
horses and mules and even a dozen hulking
camels lying in military formation grum-
bling and baring their teeth and biting at
bare brown legs in expression of their dis-
satisfaction with the business of being laden

  camels growled mohamed ah to him-
self swift mules and camels they do not
hang together hmph obviously some one
goes slowly with the camels while some one
else goes speedily with swift mules hmph
the clouds begin to lift somewhat alms
alms in the name of the compassionate
one he thrust his begging bowl into the
belly of a hastening muleteer

  is the day so short you must beg before
dawn the man growled as he thrust the
bowl aside

  no retorted the beggar the day is
long enough it is the stinginess of man
which causes me to begin early

  beg from those who have more time
than i

  the muleteer strode off and the beggar
shuffled slowly about among the noisy ac-
tivities lifting his voice occasionally in the
wail for alms some beasts he found al-
ready laden and beside them he paused
long enough to examine the bags of mer-
chandise grain apparently but these bags
were not what he sought

  now mohamed ali knew that these
early morning activities did not mean an
early morning start no moroccan cara-
van can get under way without a full day
almost of talk and argument and quarrels
and fights of bickerings which begin with
the loading of the first beast and continue
until the caravan has reached its destina-
tion for this reason the first lap of a
journey is invariably short and mohamed
ah knew that the caravan would bivouac
that night not many miles from rabat
also that the next morning would see it on
the road at sunrise

  a gray-bearded ancient paused near him
to wipe the sweat from his face and to curse
io

adventure

all camels ever created by allah mo-
hamed ah condoled with him and asked a
question

  you load for where

  fez responded the sweating one brief-
ly with a hundred beasts and if
t hey were my camels i should assuredly cut
the throat of that big gray brute at the
end

  he pointed with a grimy gnarled finger
and went back to his work

  fez thought mohamed ali the big
slow caravan goes to fez hmph and the
swift one i wonder

  he continued his wanderings slowly
speaking to some one now and then but
learning nothing further noontide came
and with it a little time for rest and food
mohamed ah seeing that the storehouse
was almost deserted entered begging bowl
in hand but with silent lips the two or
three laborers in the big building were
smoking or eating and paid no attention to
the beggar

  now mohamed alis feet were led by a
purpose somewhere in that storehouse he
thought were certain bags which were not
of standard size he wished to see them
and so he made his way quietly to the rear
of the building his one eye alert he was
about to give up his quest when in one cor-
ner he saw a big bulk covered closely by a
canvas going to it he lifted one corner a
pile of canvas bags he stretched his thumb
and httle finger to measure them and a
hand fell heavily upon his shoulder he
turned to look into the face of abd-es-selam
who stared at him with narrowed eyes

 alms sidi in the name-

  he got no further abd-es-selam with
a disconcertingly swift motion jerked the
bandage from the beggars head then
with a cry flung himself upon the mendi-
cant

  mohamed ah he cried

  and again as if even as he fought the
surprize crowded to the surface

  mohamed ah was his equal in strength
and more but two others came swiftly to
the aid of abd-es-selam and very shortly
the outlaw lay trussed with a corner of his
sulham filling his mouth but no word did
abd-es-selam say in revelation of the iden-
tity of his captive in fact he recovered one
of mohmead alis eyes with the bandage

  now this situation was highly unpleasant
to mohamed ah and abd-es-selam added

to his disgust when he taunted him with his

helplessness

  i shall take you to fez with me mo-
hamed ah he jibed sitting on a pile of
sacks near the bound outlaw yes to
fez to the sultan it is inconvenient that
is true or rather i mean it would be
much easier to take your head in one of
these bags in which you were so interested
but as his majesty has changed his offer
making it for mohamed ah ahve- this
was news to mohamed ah but was far from
disagreeable-i shall have to take you to
him complete

  i suppose he himself desires the pleasure
of witnessing your death so that there may
be no mistake as in the case of kaids aisa
and brahim besides-

  he broke off to laugh most unpleas-
antly in mohamed alis opinion

  besides i suspect that his majesty will
be most embarrassed when i do take you
to him

  a note of anger crept into his voice and
he included the two others in his speech
so that mohamed ah knew them for his
brothers

  i begin to see why he changed the form
of payment for you and your head but do
not think that it will be in his power to
release you he would not dare i shall
demand punishment for you which will also
be punishment for the young fool who sits
upon the throne and i shah get it even
though i must appeal to the people of fez
if i do so appeal not only do you die but
abd-el-aziz assuredly will cease to be sul-
tan truly habib the black magician told
truth when he said a one-eyed beggar should
bring me good fortune oh-ho i have both
you and your master safely in my hands
now

  mohamed ah was inclined to agree with
him did abd-es-selam take him to the
sultan and demand punishment no power
on earth could save him his head or the sul-
tan his throne the city would rise and
demand punishment mohamed ah had
no misconceptions concerning popular judg-
ment the people would first have him ex-
ecuted and then would make of him a
national hero and the young sultan hen
his throne too insecurely to aid him truly
abd-es-selam held all the winning cards
wherefore mohamed ah grew philosophic
closed his eyes and pretended to sleep so
that eventually abd-es-selam rose to go
the treasure of mulai el-hassan



away but he left one parting thought
with his captive

  and also mohamed ali he said grin-
ning i shall not take you to the sultan as
mohamed ah no no you will go as the
one-eyed as the filthy-beggar with the
bandage over one eye so that the people may
laugh at you and also so that his majesty
may be further embarrassed his majesty
bah his fool who tried to trick abd-
es-selam

  he called two guards to watch and went
away

  for an hour mohamed ali lay uncom-
fortably and then abd-es-selam returned
with his two brothers they paid no fur-
ther attention to him but ordered the can-
vas sacks of dates carried out as the last
one went-and mohamed ali knew that as
he lay there like a trussed fowl the treasure
of mulai-el-hassan was being carried off
before his eyes-abd-es-selam spoke to his
brothers

  you can get away within the hour it
grows late and i shall ride at once re-
member my instructions now go and
brothers though we are your lives are for-
feit to me if you fail send me two men
here

  we shall not fail the matter is a
simple one after all replied one of the
brothers and they went out almost im-
mediately two husky servants of abd-es-
selam appeared

  tie that man upon a mule he ordered
and tie him well if you value your breath
if any ask why you do so say that he has
stolen from me and that i take him to fez
for punishment

  with grunts of understanding the ser-
vants hauled mohamed ali to his feet
five minutes later he was securely tied upon
a flea-bitten mule while many people un-
known to him commented openly concern-
ing his appearance and his morals

  and in five minutes more the great cara-
van started to move two men rode close
to the bound beggar they valued their
breath and mohamed ali saw another
smaller caravan made up of swift mules
preparing also for departure

  hmph there goes the treasure of
mulai hassan he reflected and here
go i surely allah makes a jest of me

  but at the city gate there was a pause
and confusion resulting from certain cam-
els disputing as to which should be first

   

through the gate and here a brother beggar
with both eyes bandaged blindly became
entangled in the caravan and was nearly
knocked down by the mule upon which mo-
hamed ali was tied there was opportunity
for five words mohamed ali said them

chapter xi

that which is truth today tomorrow

is falsehood

	i he big caravan traveled slowly but not
so slowly as time to mohamed ah
those who had bound him had done their
work well with no thought of the physi-
cal comfort of the captive wherefore his
ankles hurt from the rope which tied them
together beneath the mules belly and his
wrists were raw from the thongs that held
them crossed before him and to add to
his discomfort the mule he rode was a little
lame and jolted every other step so that
the prisoners backbone began to hurt in
many places

  but his physical pain and discomfort
were as nothing in comparison with his
mental distress in fact he tried to keep
his thoughts upon his bodily hurts even
though that must necessarily double them
in order to escape from the pains of mind
not for himself these distressing thoughts
except as he was a factor in the great prob-
lem so far as he himself mohamed ali
the individual was concerned he was not
at all worried he was not afraid of ad-
verse fortune nor of death itself if it came to
that but as the man entrusted by the
sultan to save his throne and country he
was very grieved for mohamed ah

  he was not at all assured that his dis-
covery by abd-es-selam was an accident
it seemed equally plausible that the master
of the djinnoon had spoken a word to abd-
es-selam who thereafter had played with
him letting him believe himself unrecog-
nized and safe until the moment of depart-
ure of the caravans and yet the surprize
of abd-es-selam had not seemed to be pre-
tense when he had snatched the bandage
from the head of the beggar however
one may simulate many emotions well
with proper warning

  but although the manner of his downfall
could not be determined at the moment the
important thing was that he had fallen and
with him the hopes and plans of his majesty
adventure

and dukali as well as his own future ac-
tivities as head of the sultans secret intelli-
gence service he could see no way out of
it no way to recover the ground he had lost
while the caravan of abd-es-selam made
its slow way eastward towards fez ex-
pecting desiring to be seized by the sultans
forces and searched for possible treasure the
treasure on the backs of picked mules was
going swiftly northward even could he
manage to escape the treasure would be
beyond pursuit and in this country were no
means of electric communication whereby
word might be sent ahead to tangier to
seize the caravan by the time he reached
fez abd-es-selams brothers and the things
they carried would be entirely safe

  but at last mohamed ah forced his men-
tal stream into new channels

  between darkness and dawn he quoted
from the book allah may put an end to
many trials

  he began to count the paces of the beast
he rode but the miles had gone by al-
though doubly long and the sun feh low
before the caravan came to a noisy halt near
a fandak or more accurately a great corral
where once a week a cattle market was
held his two guards untied the ropes
from one ankle pushed him inside the cor-
ral re-tied the shin and joined in the busi-
ness of preparing for the night shortly
abd-es-selam came to examine his bonds
and to repeat his warning to the two
guards before going away he stopped to
grin down upon mohamed ah and to taunt
him a little

  ho beggar know you where the trea-
sure of mulai-el-hassan is now he gibed
in the hands of traitors and dogs

  the answer was not to the liking of abd-
es-selam and he kicked the prostrate man
with a slippered foot the blow hurt not at
ah the insult did

  perhaps perhaps growled abd-es-
selam nevertheless it is now without
doubt nearing the fandak of achmed zawi
a good twenty-five miles northward to-
morrow at this hour it will be- but no
doubt you have estimated it yourself sleep
well the treasure is safe

  your head will pay some day ob-
served mohamed ah

  that day when you shall tell his maj-
esty of the things you have seen no doubt
and when he wih dare take the word of
mohamed ah outlaw against that of abd-

es-selam his chamberlain and also there
is the small matter of proof ho ho
you dream-beggar

  and he strode off satisfied

  now the cooking pots were on the fires
and the stews were bubbling and the smell
of meat and vegetables and coffee and
pungent wood smoke were in the air dark-
ness had fallen hke a dropped curtain
and with it had come a cold wind from off
the sea which made the fires a comfort to
man and beast shortly one of the guards
went away to return with food for himself
and his fellow guard and mohamed ah as
well

  he was not a brute and although it was
manifest that he intended to take no
chances on the escape of his charge he
seemed to consider that even a thieving
one-eyed and ancient beggar has a belly
which needs be filled occasionally where-
fore he set beside the captive a generous
bowl of kesksoo several slabs of bread like
pieces of huge pancake and a glass of coffee

  quickly ah the bowls were emptied and
fingers licked despite the captives roped
wrists then one guard brought forth a
package of algerian cigarets made of
black strong tobacco treated with salt-
peter to insure combustion one he offered
to mohammed ah who smoked it and then
stretched out drew the hood of his djellaba
over his face and bade them good night
for an hour they smoked and talked of the
incidents of the day then they too lay
down to sleep and in another hour there-
after the fandak was quiet save for certain
snorings the fires died to great heaps of
glowing coals and only shadows moved a
little now and then time passed and even
the most restless sank deep into the oblivion
of sleep

  suddenly the crash of rifle shots shattered
the silence another volley and a con-
tinued crashing and wild shouts bedlam
broke loose the fandak sought lights and
in so doing feh over each other and each
thought the other to be an enemy the red
spurt of guns whipped the air and these
guns were in the fandak not outside a
bullet struck a heap of embers and the heap
exploded hke a volcano

  mules and horses snorted and broke loose
trailing their picket ropes to trip those
who frantically sought lights here and
there a match flared in unsteady hands and
a lantern glowed a bullet struck one
the treasure of mulai el-hassan

and the scattered oil ignited for a httle
space the fandak was lighted but nothing
was to be seen save a maelstrom of fright-
ened or bewildered men and beasts

  and as suddenly as it had begun the
firing and the shouting ceased there was
the sound of horses hoofs pounding away
in the distance and abd-es-selam lantern
in one hand and pistol in the other shouted
savage commands while he made his way to
the spot where the beggar had lain

  his sigh of relief was audible even in the
hubbub when he saw a bound figure squat-
ting upon the ground between the two
guards who looked about dazedly and
squinted at the light the storm had
arisen raged and passed so swiftly that
they like most of their slow-witted fellows
were scarcely fully awake

  for a httle while abd-es-salem gazed at
the bound beggar who returned the stare
and raised his hands awkwardly to adjust
the hood of his djellaba and to scratch be-
neath the bandage about his head then
his attention was demanded by one of the
guards

  what-what was it asked the fellow

  ask some one who knows growled abd-
es-selam and bestowed another kick upon
the captive i thought-but never mind
what i thought continue to guard this
fellow well or misfortune will descend upon
you swiftly

  he turned back to the middle of the
fandak and began throwing commands here
and there

  abd-es-selam grows to be like an old
woman growled one of the guards a
man does not run away whose feet are tied
i should like to know what all this business
meant but i am still sleepy and it is abd-
es-selams caravan after all

  he composed himself again following the
example already set by the captive and was
soon imitated by his fellow guard and
eventually silence came once more to the
fandak to be broken this time only by
dawn and the shouts of the caravan master
announcing another day within an hour
the caravan had broken fast and was upon
the road

  allah complained one of the guards
who rode beside the one-eyed beggar upon
a lame and flea-infested mule allah i am
still sleepy and i do not know yet what it
was all about

  perhaps we shall find out later offered

the beggar it is not always possible to
know the true meaning of a thing until a
certain time has passed

chaptep xii

rags or silk-and what is beneath

a bd-es-selam pushed his caravan
along as one hurries who knows that
at the end of the journey waits reward or
love or revenge but he who can hurry
camels can hurry time itself and so it was
ten oclock of the fourth day before the
gates of fez were reached

  small attention had abd-es-selam paid
to the beggar on the way nothing more
than to assure himself each night that the
captives bonds were well tied to repeat his
commands to the guards and each morning
to satisfy his own eyes that the beggar was
still there but each time his eyes met the
single orb of the mendicant they glowed
with hatred and victory once only when
they chanced to be out of hearing of others
did abd-es-selam taunt his prisoner

  it seems to me that the formidable mo-
hamed ali has been greatly overrated he
said and that i always suspected now
he rides like a beaten child in silence and
obedience why does he not proclaim him-
self to my men perhaps there is one
among them who might aid himto
escape

  one does not seek lions in a kennel
answered the captive

  nor mohamed ali in beggars rags
abd-es-selams retort was quick

  that also is true the mendicant smiled
a httle yet who can tell what is beneath
a garment or a face a patched djellaba
may cover a beggar or mohamed ah a
white sulham may cover an honest man-or
abd-es-selam

  the man so taunted raised his whip as if
to strike but lowered it slowly

  i can afford to wait he growled and
with a curse rode off

  but with entrance into the crowded
streets of the capital abd-es-selam in-
creased his watchfulness upon the great
plains there was httle chance for the escape
of a fugitive mounted upon a lame mule
in the throngs of the city it were best to be
on guard wherefore as they passed
through the gate he took position beside
the beggar just inside the gate was a


adventure

small garrison of city guards upon their
captain abd-es-selam called

  i his majestys chamberlain desire
two soldiers to ride with me to the palace
at once

  the captain gave a guttural order and
two red-coated yellow-trousered crimson-
fezzed guards stepped forth and saluted
abd-es-selam

  walk you one on each side of this beg-
gar ordered the chamberlain he is a
thief whom i take to the sultan

  the guards fell into place and abd-es-
selam turned to his caravan-master

  i ride to the palace take you the cara-
van to my fandak and await my orders
there

  then with a guard hanging to each stir-
rup of the captives mule the chamberlain
rode swiftly toward the palace and his
triumph a quarter of an hour was suf-
ficient to see him in his own quarters the
beggar bound and now gagged again lay
upon the cushion whither the servants of
abd-es-selam had carried and thrown him

  the chamberlain removed the dust of
travel donned clean clothing and made his
way to the captain of the sultans body-
guard

  tell his majesty that i desire audience
with him he said and followed the cap-
tain to the threshold of the sultans house

  the captain opened a great door and
swung it behind him abd-es-selam waited
impatiently but even a chamberlain must
be announced before entering the presence
he heard the faint sound of a phonograph
and smiled grimly the boy amuses him-
self he thought presently he shah
have a new sort of entertainment

  it was a short wait however the music
stopped abruptly and the captain again
swung open the door and stood aside for
abd-es-selam to pass the chamberlain
with hatred and victory thrilling like an
electric current in his blood threw his
sulham back over both shoulders as they
must who enter the presence he entered
took a dozen steps into the great room and
bowed low to mulai abd-el-aziz and again
to kaid dukah who sat beside him upon
the cushions he looked smilingly but
keenly into each face in that of the sultan
he found a puzzled chagrin disappointment
in that of kaid dukah he fancied he saw
fear in which he may have seen truly for
dukah a quick reader of faces himself had

noted the triumph in abd-es-selams eyes
and feared for mohamed ali

  approach commanded the sultan
and make your business known

  the chamberlain strode forward knelt
swiftly in obeisance and then straightened

  i bring a gift for your majesty he said
will you order me to have the captain of
the guards bring it hither

  the eyes of the young monarch sought
those of dukah but found there no sug-
gestion

  it is an order he said then

  and-and your majesty i would es-
teem it a boon could i be permitted to have
the vizier saidi present it is a matter
which concerns him somewhat

  now the vizier saidi was suspected of
being a friend to abd-es-selam and of not
being one of the sultans most ardent sup-
porters but he was a man of considerable
wealth and power and perhaps the foremost
authority in the country upon mohamme-
dan law the anxiety in dukahs heart
deepened

  it is an unusual request said the
sultan

  and an unusual gift sidna replied
abd-es-selam quickly wherefore as a

favor-

  granted his majestys tone was
short let us hope the gift is unusual
enough to warrant the preparation made to
present it you have our leave to retire
swiftly-once out of the room where con-
vention ruled that he must make his exist
backing and bowing-abd-es-selam found
the captain of the guards and had him send
for the vizier saidi then he himself went
to his own quarters and returned propelling
the one-eyed beggar by the arm at the en-
trance he found saidi awaiting him to
him he whispered two words a name which
brought a grunt of surprize and a swift look
of question at the bandaged face

  again the doors were opened by the cap-
tain again abd-es-selam stood before
his majesty the beggar at his right the
vizier saidi at his left and made obeisance
but there was no humbleness in the glance
which he threw at the now pale dukah nor
in the hah sneer with which he noted the
trembling hands of the sultan the cap-
tain of the guards took up a position behind
them

  your majesty abd-es-selam spoke
slowly it has ever been my aim to serve
the treasure of mulai el-hassan

your majesty to the best of my ability
but i have not always been convinced that
your majesty has felt in me the confidence
and for me the friendliness which it has been
my wish to inspire

  the sultan moved a hand restlessly
there was insult in the motion slight as it
was a repudiation of abd-es-selam and all
his works but the monarchs eyes like
those of dukah were fixed upon the beggar
who stood with bent head before them
mohamed ali beyond a doubt was caught
by the one he had set a trap for the dirt of
the fandaks clung to face and beard and the
bandage had shpped down a httle so that it
almost concealed both eyes dukali seek-
ing another evidence leaned over until he
could see the bound hands of the prisoner
who turned slightly as if consciously to help
him upon a finger of the right hand was
mohamed alis ring and dukalis heart fell

  assuredly he grieved there can be
no mistake this time abd-es-selam has
had him captive and therefore has made
certain

  as if in answer to his unvoiced words the
chamberlain spoke

  there is no doubt no doubt at all your
majesty- his eyes flickered with malice
and his lips curled in a httle grin-that
your majesty is aware that i am a faithful
servant for a long time i have desired to
prove it to your majesty by some signal
service at last fortune smiled upon me
allah thrust into my hands the person
of-

  he paused poised on the pinnacle of his
triumph

  kaid dukali had been thinking swiftly
he perceived the things abd-es-selam had
in mind the vizier saidi had been desired
as a witness because he was no friend of the
sultan and because he was the countrys
chief exponent of the koranic law truly
abd-es-selam had won the game once
the bandage was torn from the head of
mohamed ali the sultan could not save
him

  the vizier knew the law-and would teu
it to the city and the law was above even
the sultan his failure to punish the out-
law for whom he had so long offered rewards
this in the hands of those who knew how to
use it to the utmost would be more than
enough excuse for the city to rise and de-
throne him to set the country in that last
flame which demands the fall of its ruler

the kaid forgot the mission of mohamed
ali forgot that loss of the treasure meant
national ruin forgot all save that now two
words hung between his friend and death
and as abd-es-selam paused and raised his
hand toward the beggars head dukali
spoke

  a moment the upraised hand halted
the action of the chamberlain i kaid
dukali formally charge the chamberlain
abd-es-selam with conspiring against the
life of the sultan my own head- he
turned toward the sultan and his eyes
flashed- my own head answers for the
charge your majesty

  but we do not--

  i have not told you my master but
it is true i repeat the charge

  it is an empty one as allah is my wit-
ness answered abd-es-selam nay
more it is a trick only this-there is a
certain man who is friend great friend to
kaid dukali it is for his sake that he lies
the hand of dukali flashed to the dagger
at his belt as the word left the lips of the
chamberlain

  your majesty my master- he be-
gan but the sultan gave the signal for
silence

  and from you abd-es-selam silence
for the moment also he commanded

  he closed his eyes as though weary
then suddenly he opened them rose swiftly
and with one hand stretched menacingly
towards his chamberlain spoke with a voice
which kaid dukah had never heard before
which brought him to his feet with a new
hope

  abd-es-selam the monarch sud-
denly strong formed his words carefully
we think you make a jest of us you
spoke of your desire to serve you have
never served us you spoke of your loyalty
you have never been loyal you spoke of
your desire to share our confidence but our
confidence is not for our enemies and at
last you say you bring us a gift to be
presented with much formality and in the
presence of-of your friend saidi

  the vizier winced at the sultans little
hesitation and at the slight emphasis he put
upon the last three words

  now-now- the voice deepened
menaced you bring us our gift a filthy
beggar think you that such a jest may be
borne by us have we become so common
so low so httle to be respected that a dog
adventure

whom we have raised to our household may
insult us with such a jest

  abd-es-selam attacked from an unex-
pected quarter was startled but his
thoughts were swift dukah seeing the
manner in which this royal youth had risen
to a seemingly hopeless situation under-
standing the royal bluff his master was play-
ing trembled with admiration and hope

  go ordered the sultan and the word
boomed through the room go before
i send you with my captain

  the captain of the guards stepped for-
ward to the side of the chamberlain but
abd-es-selams quick brain had reassured
him he saw that the sultan was bluffing
but he saw also that unless he had temerity
to face the potentates anger his own head
would pay the price he bowed low

  very well your majesty i hear and

obey but first-

  with a motion so quick that the eyes
could scarcely follow he whipped the ban-
dage from the beggars head and stepped
back his face distorted with anger and
mahce

  observe my gift your majesty he
bowed again mohamed ah

  again he looked at the sultan and then
swiftly at the beggar

  allah he shouted allah

  a white vacant eye-socket stared at him
out of a face which grinned cheerfully

chapter xiii

no path of evil without its quick-
sands

nphe effect of the beggars face upon
those who stared at it was ludicrous
even though the situation bulged with
tragedy

  now perhaps i may ask why i am tied
up like a sack of meal by this man and
carried here always insisting that i am
mohamed ah and not aisa the one-
eyed

  it was the voice of the beggar and it cut
the cord of formahty as he spoke he re-
stored the bandage to its place human
nature asserted itself the relief of the
sultan and dukah was so huge the bewil-
derment of vizier saidi so evident that
even the amazement and terror of the
chamberlain could not command gravity
mohamed ah

  the sultans voice cracked and reseating
himself he rocked with mirth

  mohamed ah echoed dukali his eyes
seeking his masters ho ho ho a
royal gift your majesty royal indeed
a one-eyed beggar a ragged djellaba and
allah alone knows how many lice ho
ho ho abd-es-selam sets a new style
in gifts from a chamberlain

  allah is my witness cried abd-es-
selam whom anger now consumed allah
is my witness your majesty that this man
was mohamed ah

  and a miracle no doubt changed him
the sultan said dryly his eyes gleamed
but not with friendship for his chamberlain

  i meant-i mean that in rabat i laid
hands upon mohamed ah knowing that
his capture was a thing dear to your majes-
tys heart i bound him securely and started
at once for fez

  hoping to serve us offered the sultan
hoping to serve your majesty but-
but there was no opportunity allah
perhaps i am not in my right mind i
myself watched there was no chance of
escape

  but if mohamed ah escaped what is the
purpose of bringing this poor beggar in his
stead

  he could not have escaped and whence
came this poor fool i know not allah
and i have been guarding this beggar while

mohamed ah-

  he stopped and panic entered his heart
what had mohamed ali been doing while
he abd-es-selam had been carrying the
beggar to fez and how in the name of
allah had mohamed ah tricked him thus

  at any rate your majesty he con-
tinued after a moment at any rate you
observe that my intentions were to serve
you even though something has occurred
which i can not explain and which has taken
my gift from us both assuredly your
majesty will not punish one of his followers
for-for such a misfortune

  the sultan his face composed and
thoughtful again looked at kaid dukah
and dukali looked at him the minds of
both were busy with the same question
that abd-es-selam had held the person of
mohamed ah neither doubted nor that
mohamed ah by a clever stroke had freed
himself and sent out in his place a hostage
which should confound the plans of the
chamberlain but where was mohamed
the treasure of mulai el-hassan

ali now where was the treasure if he had
discovered it why had abd-es-selam re-
turned so quickly to fez

  the hangings which covered one side of
the room parted shghtly and a court officer
looked towards the group catching du-
kalis eye he made a signal which caused the
kaid to go to him after a few words had
been exchanged dukah again sought the
sultans side and murmured a sentence
his majesty nodded his head and looked
into his friends eyes with a question but
dukalis face showed nothing then nor
when he shortly commanded the beggar to
follow him they disappeared through the
curtains but a moment later reappeared
dukali to take his place at the sultans
side the beggar to stand meekly by

  we can not punish you for that it is
true said the sultan but there is an-
other side to the matter which apparently
you have not thought of we mean this
that you say you had the person of our
enemy mohamed ah but that he escaped
from you now to our mind you are to
blame for that escape assuredly no one
else is wherefore- he turned suddenly
to the vizier saidi-wherefore is it not
justice that for that he should be pun-
ished

  abd-es-selam also turned upon the vi-
zier his lips formed a word but his teeth
held it back

  i-i- it would seem so sidna ex-
cept that-

  very good the sultan cut him off
very good you know the law

  he smiled a httle abd-es-selam could
at least be justly isolated for a few days and
in a few days many things may happen
but here dukah asked permission to speak

  and what about the caravan abd-es-
selam he asked

   it-it is in my fandak of course

  hm one is i suppose and the
other

   the face of the chamberlain paled a httle
what other i know of but one that
which i brought with me from rabat
carrying grain for the most part

  for the most part repeated dukali
the other part was not by chance anything
which-which belongs to his majesty
which belongs to his majesty i know
not what you mean abd-es-selam spoke
boldly enough but the voice of danger
shouted in his heart all that i have the

caravan included of course is at his majes-
tys service

  he means the treasure of mulai el-

hassan

   it was the beggar who spoke and to each
his words brought a different emotion the
sultan stared the vizier shook a bewil-
dered head dukah smiled as a man smiles
who knows of hidden matters and abd-es-
selams eyes narrowed as he looked at the
one who spoke he swallowed with an
effort

  the man is insane he said at last
what is this treasure of mulai el-hassan of
which he speaks

   that which your brothers carried north-
ward from rabat answered the beggar

   allah he dreams cried abd-es-selam
but his palms were sweating and his words
had claws which tore his throat the
sultan stared alternately at the beggar and
at abd-es-selam

  no dream replied the beggar or
else perchance the canvas sacks of dates a
hands breadth longer than the usual size
at sight of the spasm which twisted the
face of his chamberlain the sultan started
and for a space his eyes bored into those of
abd-es-selam then

   so so you have tried to rob us of that
which is ours even as i suspected

  this is madness your majesty this
beggar he either dreams or lies

   and yet he dreams or lies with a strange
semblance to the truth the sultan mo-
tioned to the beggar have you still other
dreams beggar

   the beggar nodded slowly

  yes your majesty these things i
know to be truth first the treasure of
mulai el-hassan your father upon whom
be peace was taken from the city wall of
rabat where this man abd-es-selam hid
it it was divided the gold and jewels
hidden in sacks especially made of a httle
greater length and surrounded by dried
dates which as you know are heavy two
caravans were formed one that which
came hither with abd-es-selam large and
slow-traveling bearing grain for the most
part the other bearing the treasure bags
was composed of swift mules which went
northward the two brothers of abd-es-

selam-

   lies lies

   silence

   the sultans voice thundered in anger at
adventure

abd-es-selam and the captain of the guards
laid a warning hand upon his shoulder

  the two brothers of abd-es-selam were
in charge of the caravan which went north-
ward they were to carry the treasure to
tangier where no doubt a boat would be
in waiting to take it to france but the
two brothers died upon the way before going
very far mohamed ali killed them
mohamed ah exclaimed the sultan in
surprize and a swift flash of relief swept his
face

  he looked at dukah and smiled that
smile meant praise for mohamed ah and
was answered in kind but abd-es-selam
though fear now pinched his features was
no coward

  do not believe it your majesty he
cried this is another trick

  proceed ordered the sultan to the
beggar eyeing his chamberlain coldly

  yes mohamed ah killed them both
while his men were overpowering the others
you see your majesty mohamed ali had
a dozen of his own men in rabat for an
emergency

  but mohamed ah was my prisoner in
rabat cried abd-es-selam as allah is
my -witness

  he speaks truth there agreed the beg-
gar he discovered mohamed ali and
bound him and told him unwisely many
things desiring to taunt him things
which were useful when mohamed ali re-
gained his liberty

  and that was accomphshed in what
manner

  the sultan leaned forward eagerly

  very simply mohamed alis men came
upon abd-es-selams caravan on the first
night turned the fandak into an uproar and
replaced mohamed ali by his double

  allah kerim the exclamation came
from dukah mohamed ali escapes and
with the same motion snares his captor in a
pretty trap

  the sultan nodded his eyes shining
and then continued the beggar mo-
hamed ah rode northward with his men
who had rescued him and overtook the
other caravan of abd-es-selam by night of
the following day horses are swifter even
than swift mules and having overcome
the caravan mohamed ali put the heads
of abd-es-selams brothers in a sack and
led the caravan back to fez it hes now in
one of your majestys fandaks but the

bags of dates and what is secreted within
them are elsewhere

  he ceased and the sultan turned his eyes
upon his chamberlain

  what has abd-es-selam to say to this
he asked sternly

  now was the chamberlain convinced that
through some jest of allah his plans had
been wrecked and revealed and his head
brought close to the executioners sword
but summoning ah his strength of will he
played the only card he had left turning
to the vizier saidi he asked

  it is the law i think that there must be
proof more proof than the mere word of a
beggar such as this one against me

  that is the law agreed the vizier
then i must demand proof your
majesty this beggar- he cast a look
of insult at the man-this beggar has
come by idle gossip and dreamed dreams
unless he is a tool of my enemies how
knows he these things it is impossible by
his own admissions he says i brought
him in my own caravan bound to fez
assuredly he has not heard these wild tales
here speak miserable one

  that i did not say replied the beggar
not that you brought me bound to fez
see your majesty already he contra-
dicts himself

  the chamberlain regained courage per-
haps after all this was only a trick to catch
him a trick carefully planned by the sultan
and dukali

  he admits having lied to your majesty
he told you first that i brought him here
now he denies having said it now-
he turned upon the beggar-now explain
if you can explain

  as you wish answered the beggar
you are confused abd-es-selam it was
aisa the one-eyed who told you that
i am- a quick hand tore aside the
bandage-mohamed ah

chapter xiv

if allah is to judge you be sure of
your case

abd-es-selam facing mohamed ah
closed his eyes as one in pain and
swayed a httle but not by weakness had
he fought plotted and suffered his way from
poverty and obscurity to wealth and posi-
tion knowing now that he looked into
the treasure of mulai el-hassan

the eyes of that destiny which an inscrut-
able fate had traced upon his forehead at
birth he regained control of himself with a
mighty effort an effort which drew his face
into deep-cut lines and which tore at the
eye-balls and with an exertion as that of
a man lifting a great burden he turned his
head until he met the eyes of the sultan

  i have no further defense to make your
majesty his voice was harsh on this
charge he added that your father
mulai el-hassan entrusted me with his
treasure is true that upon his death and
the seizure of power by that upstart bou
hamed i concealed the treasure is also
true even though mulai el-hassan named
your majesty as his successor i did not be-
lieve it was his wish that bou hamed should
become the actual sovereign wherefore-
wherefore i acted in accord with my opin-
ion had i revealed the secret to bou
hamed-and allah knows that he stopped
only at torture to wring it from me-where
would it have gone with all else that the
sultan el-hassan left behind him into the
hands of those who ever since have preyed
upon your majesty and upon our country

  now these were bold words and for a
moment all who heard them were startled
and for a space also were the waters of
truth made muddy but only for a little

  and that growled mohamed ali is
the reason you attempt to send these treas-
ures to france where i suspect you were
about to go yourself if your plans failed
here

  and who are you abd-es-salem de-
manded the sultan flushing to decide
what is good and what is evil for our em-
pire am i sultan or no

  abd-es-selam bowed silent affirmative

  and therefore continued his majesty
it appears to us that your words are noth-
ing more than hes and that you have tried
to rob us of that which is ours and have
failed

  again abd-es-selam bowed and said
nothing

  but your majesty- it was dukah
who spoke now there is still a more
serious charge against this man a httle
while ago i made the charge and offered my
own head as hostage

  and that charge i denied abd-es-
selam turned viciously upon dukah
think you not that i understood the pur-
pose of your accusation that i failed to

see it was to protect this the beggar whom
you also thought to be mohamed ali your
tool

  let us see what mohamed ah can tell
us of the matter replied dukah calmly

  speak mohamed requested the sul-
tan

  it came about in this wise your majes-
ty in a beggars garments i lay in the
kitchens of abd-es-selam there at mid-
night came two slaves brothers who were
much afraid i know not who they were
one of them had overheard spied upon a
meeting between abd-es-selam and the
german langmann it concerned the life
of your majesty which was to be taken by
means of a machine for the making of por-
traits the slaves were much afraid as i
have said and decided to seek safety at
once by flight to their native village i
being only a beggar could not detain them
myself but i informed dukah of the
affair and-and he took the necessary steps
i believe

  the first we have heard of it said the
sultan looking questioningly at dukah
we knew that herr langmann was found
dead upon the street but the physicians
said that his heart had been weak

  that could not have been the cause of
death said dukah with cynical lips for
your majesty well knows that herr lang-
mann had no heart but one should not
jest concerning the dead may he roast in
el hotamal the matters that happened
were thus i received the camera which
had a poisoned needle and invited lang-
mann and abd-es-selam and the french
consul to tea with me then-i showed
the german how to operate the machine
with his own finger thereupon he ran
away and died after which i explained
the poison device to the french consul
he i thought would be a good witness
should one be needed

   a smile flashed across the face of the sul-
tan and was gone

  and this man abd-es-selam

   oh naturally he asserted that it was all
the work of the german not having the
slaves in our hands we waited

  this your majesty broke in abd-es-
selam is another lie the two slaves
who ran away i had beaten besides run-
ning away they stole from me a consider-
able amount of money which they took
with them these lies they no doubt
adventure

devised to protect themselves or for revenge
upon me

  and consequently whispered them with
fear and trembhng with hps touching ear at
midnight in a rogm they supposed to be
deserted

  mohamed alis voice had a rough edge

  or so far as i know the he was born in
the head of mohamed ah himself abd-es-
selam offered

  allah thought mohamed ah this
man is no coward at any rate almost-
almost i could be merciful to him were i
the sidna

  at any rate your majesty continued
abd-es-selam this tale is not evidence
where are the slaves it is not the law that
what one claims to have overheard may be
admitted as evidence is that not true
saidi where are the slaves

  yes by allah thought mohamed ah
further were i the sultan i should pardon
and use this man he plays his only card
as though it were unbeatable where are
the slaves hmph he has us there

  and aloud

  they will be brought hither in a short
time

  abd-es-selam flashed an edged look at
mohamed ali and shrugged his shoulders

  then we must wait until they are
found

  his hesitation before the last word as
well as a httle tightening of the hps showed
that he saw through the reason for the
delay

  and in the meantime i can but deny
this charge and i do deny it allah be my
judge

  let allah be his judge said mohamed
ah quickly that is well

  he drew nearer the sultan and spoke
swiftly in lowered voice the sultan re-
flected a moment smiled and nodded

  and in the meantime concluded mo-
hamed ah let him be watched most care-
fully your majesty he is a clever man
and a brave one and we do not desire to
lose him

  so be it ordered the sultan with a
motion to the captain of the guards bind
him

  the captain snapped a pair of handcuffs
upon the chamberlains wrists

  now take him into the next room
never leave him if he escapes you it were
better you should die by your own hand

  he shah not escape your majesty an-
swered the captain and led away his captive

  and you vizier saidi embodiment of
the law- the sultans voice was hard
and tired-await you in your own quarters
until we shall send for you be sure you
understand in your own quarters and
let your hps be sealed with the seal of
silence unless you wish to die

  the vizier bowed low and departed
and i am weary i must rest said the
sultan no doubt you two- his smile
embraced mohamed ah and dukah-have
matters to discuss you are our friends
and we love you both concerning recent
matters we shall speak to you a httle later
he withdrew into a private room of which
the doorway was concealed by curtains

  and now said dukah when the cur-
tains fell again into place what about
these slaves naturally i myself have
sought them but in vain

  hmph grunted mohamed ah he
had us there and whether they shall be
forthcoming or not i am far from certain
to you i admit that i feel most foolish
those slaves as i said i could not myself
detain nevertheless i had secreted at
the time in your stables a trustworthy and
intelligent black filial who has often been
of aid to me him i found in the darkness
and bade him secure aid and follow and cap-
ture the slaves he did so and took them
to a place he knows of but-and through
no fault of his for he was almost killed-
they escaped

  and you of course know not whither
naturally but now this is why i say
i feel most foohsh upon my arrival in fez
this morning and as i passed through the
city gate a hand was laid upon my shoulder
do you know one called the master of the
djinnoon

  mohamed ah shot his question and
watched dukah with keen eyes but
aside from a smile which might have been
caused merely by the naming of such a one
he observed nothing

  of him i have heard

  hmph do you know him

  i have met him

  now by allah between you and me
there must be no curtains henceforth

listen-

  and mohamed ah told of the episode in
the house of the black magician at the very
beginning of his task
the treasure of mulai el-hassan



  and now he concluded what i desire
to know is did you tell this dabbler in the
occult anything concerning my mission is
he in the confidence of his majesty or your-
self

  kaid dukah shook his head slowly
habib the magician is a strange man
he has served me once and my master
once also no more i think things
which are hidden from others are seen by
him sometimes but not always i sus-
pect suspect only mark you that he is the
head in this country of the sanyssiyah

secret service and if that be the case-

  allah if that be the case broke in
mohamed ali he has a secret service which
i can never hope to equal

  assuredly few things occur of which he
does not learn quickly but i think also
nay i am certain that he has clairvoyant
power to a high degree that he showed
you

  now are many things made clearer
relief was in mohamed alis voice man-
ifestly the black magician and i must come
to know each other better in order that we
may watch each other more closely but i
am relieved perhaps he will keep his
promise but i have not told you at the
city gate a hand was laid upon my shoulder
i looked into the magicians face he knew
me beyond a doubt he knew me despite
my rags and bandage and begging

bowl-

  what would abd-es-selam not have
given for that perception commented
dukali

  and he whispered the missing slaves
of abd-es-selam shall be brought to you to-
day in midafternoon only that and he
was gone

  it was afternoon now observed dukali
but i feel that the slaves will be here he
is a strange man and a marvellously wise
one

  you beheve at all in his djinnoon

  i believe in everything replied dukah
smiling somewhat he added and
laughed aloud at mohamed alis look of
scorn but now you must be weary let
us go to my quarters there you may
rest while i discover what dates is within the
bags of abd-es-selam i hope greatly that
the treasure is there and that it will
satisfy europe until we can turn around

  i think it will answered mohamed
ali it is there assuredly judging from

the weight of the bags although i had no
time to examine it

  you have saved the sultan his throne
hmph and a dozen times nearly lost
him the head of a faithful servant

chapter xv

neither shall ye weaken the power

of allah so as to escape it-al koran

vtohamed ali was summoned from
lva slumber even as he had been a few
days previously among the anjerah hills by
kaid dukali whose face now as then was a
friendly lamp lighted by smiles mo-
hamed ali sat up yawning stretching his
great shoulders and blinking his eyes

  the slaves are here said dukali

  all remnants of drowsiness left his friend
who sprang to his feet and stared into the
eyes of the kaid

  then-then the master of the djin-
noon-

  precisely dukah nodded his head
toward a doorway the black magician
and the two slaves they wait in there
allah i think now that i did not much
trust his word when he said he would bring
them to me it sounded much like an idle
boast his djinnoon i suppose

  dukah laughed

  of course to some extent but when
you told me that he had made such a prom-
ise i recalled that i had heard that these
two slaves had once belonged to him who
calls himself the master of the djinnoon
consequently i argued that it would be
highly probable that he knew of their hur-
ried flight and equally probable that he
knew the name of the village which had
mothered them

  and you told him this

  oh in a fashion but i gave his djin-
noon credit also there is no need friend
of mine to disprove a tale which injures
no one there is much to be gained by ap-
pearing to beheve even when one knows
that a thing is false thereby one makes
friends and opens many mouths which
otherwise would be closed and i do not
think that all of the black magicians works
can be so easily explained

  hmph perhaps not no doubt i
shah have plenty of occasion to find out
in the future then without doubt the
slaves were in his hands even when he told


adventure

me at the city gate that he would bring
them why couldnt he have said so
that i believe to be true neverthe-
less every man has the right to govern his
own actions up to a certain variable point
if habit desired to make somewhat of a
mystery of the matter that was his right i

think and as he was serving us-

  i am not complaining interrupted
mohamed ah allah i am pleased i
should still be pleased if his majesty the
master of the djinnoon should bring the
slaves to us painted in all the colors of the
rainbow and calling them princes of abys-
sinia what i want is the slaves and i care
not how why nor where but as for the
when the sooner the better i desire to see
an end of abd-es-selams works

  allah permitting offered dukah
now let us go i have told his majesty
how things stand he will come in a httle
while- he glanced at the watch upon his
wrist-to sit in judgment upon abd-es-
selam to hear the slaves and to view the
treasure which as you have slept i have
prepared for his sight come you may
look upon it before he arrives

  even a beggar such as i- his hands
brushed over the tattered djellaba which he
still wore- may enjoy sight of treasure
they went swiftly toward the sultans
audience chamber which by dukalis or-
ders was now guarded by half a dozen war-
riors stalwart and grim they came to
salute as the kaid approached and stared
with curiosity at dukalis companion

  two great treasure chests of massive oak
bound with hand-wide iron bands their hds
thrown back gaped hungrily at one end
of the room they were empty but upon
the floor ah about them were piles of gold
coin jewels in little baskets and two score
bars of yellow gold built up hke a minia-
ture mosque tower

  i think that his majesty has his million
pounds sterling said mohamed ah

  more than that or i am no judge an-
swered dukah see here and here

  he lifted a hand toward mohamed ah
two necklaces one of diamonds and the
other of great rubies hung from his fingers
and flashed hke chains of flame

  there will be reward in this for you he
said and opportunity you shall be
the haroun-el-raschid of morocco and the
power behind the throne

  hmph and in due course shah die no

doubt as haroun the great died by poison
allah forbid and you shall be a vizier

with horsemen always to precede you-

  shouting behold the head of the sul-
tans secret service  offered mohamed
ah dryly that would be most excellent
no if his majesty desires to create a let
us say pohtical intelligence service i am
ready to serve him but if he desires only
a new vizier some one to wear a title grace-
fully and fill an office without labor he had
better name one dukah for the post for
ill have none of it lifes too short and im
too old dukah to play monkey-on-a-

string now you-

  his big laugh cut off his words dukah
took the gibe in good spirit but seized at
once upon what had been said with an air
of well-considered decision

  nevertheless mohamed he said the
matter is important be not hasty wait
until his majesty shah take the matter up
with you

  and there is another thing dukah i
think that if i accept the task it will be nec-
essary for me to talk with his majesty as
if he were only mohamed ahs brother in-
stead of sultan of morocco his unwise
friendships his thoughtless extravagance

his misplaced trusts-

  are things which he will thank mo-
hamed ali to correct said a calm voice in
which there was just a hint of laughter

  both men swung about to face the sultan
both sank to knee but abd-el-aziz bade
them rise

  yesterday i was not what i am today
he said no even this afternoon i am
not what i was this morning and i be-
lieve i hope-

  his voice faltered and his head bent
but quickly he straightened held a hand
out to each of his companions and with the
strength of sudden purpose of a new man-
hood said while he looked into their eyes
oh i am sultan i know commander
of the faithful prince of islam but i am
also young and i need-i need true friends
be them to me now for once if never
again i may say that i have been foohsh
thoughtless headstrong and worse

  nay be not embarrassed mohamed
ah and let truth be always upon your lips
for me at least i speak in all sincerity i
need your friendship i need your service
and if you give me both friendship and
service- a whimsical smile caressed his
the treasure of mulai el-hassan



lips-part of your reward will be the
privilege of telling the truth as you see it
to your ruler

  that is high reward your majesty re-
plied mohamed ah i think- mo-
hamed ah could be as whimsical as the
young sultan-but i think perhaps the
novelty of such a thing will be worth it to
your majesty

  it is a bargain then asked the sultan
  it is a bargain assented mohamed ah
  the sovereign turned to dukali

  still he said here is one who tells
me the truth although perhaps not all of it
but he is my friend and loves me as i love
him

  which is the reason offered mohamed
ah that he does not tell you all the truth
the eyebrows of the sultan lifted but he
laughed

  and therefore mohamed ah will not
love me so that he may always tell me the
entire truth

  love is blindness and bhndness is
death answered mohamed ali gravely
whereupon i shall assuredly try to keep
from being blind

  and this- the sultan moved toward
the treasure strewn upon the floor-the
treasure of mulai el-hassan my father he
cried

  quick glances encompassed it estimated
its worth

  more than is needed your majesty
said dukah

  you have save our throne mohamed
ali and i think the country our grati-
tude is yours and your reward that which
you may desire

  i ask no reward your majesty mo-
hamed ahs tone was blunt i served
you-because-because i desired somewhat
to serve my country

  and that is the sort of service which
deserves reward the other sort is bought
and paid for here your hand

  mohamed ah held out his right hand
from his own fingers the sultan drew a gold
band carved with the roses of marraksh
but without a jewel and slipped it upon
that of mohamed ah

  this mohamed ah has no value except
that it belonged to my father mulai el-
hassan will you accept it

  mohamed ah nodded gravely

  it shall bind me to your majestys
service he answered

  the sultan drew two papers from his belt
one he handed to mohamed ah the other
to dukah to the former he said

  this is the formal pardon for mohamed
ah with good and sufficient reasons given
namely that he has frustrated a plot against
our life and prevented the robbing of us
by abd-es-selam that paper which you
have dukah is a copy of the proclamation
duly signed see that it is posted today
mohamed ah you are outlaw no longer
mohamed ali dropped to one knee then
arose

  i thank your majesty he said

  your viziership awaits you

  that can not be your majesty de-
murred mohamed ah and explained why
as he spoke the sultan began to nod his
head thoughtfully

  you are right mohamed ah he said
when he had finished we see that the
honor is an empty one to you at least
but and more important is the work to
be done so be it from this moment
you are the head of our political intelligence
service he smile grimly you shah
be a busy man mohamed ah i assure you
if your task is to defend our country against
foes within and without

  no doubt no doubt your majesty
yet it is better to work than to pray in such
a situation as now confronts us and i may
find time for an occasional prayer at that
there remains the matter of abd-es-
selam your majesty said dukah now
it grows late the slaves as i informed
your majesty have been found and are
now here they substantiate ah that mo-
hamed ah has said concerning them
send for the vizier saidi then com-
manded the sultan so that that light of
the law may see what he may see

  dukah sped upon the errand

  and i your majesty must wait out-
side said mohamed ah

  you have our leave to retire said the
sultan and mohamed ali withdrew

  dukah quickly returned followed by
saidi who had obeyed to the letter his
majestys instructions to remain silent in
his own quarters he had not even thought
of leaving them had not even wished to
speak he was thoroughly cowed upon
his heels entered the master of the djin-
noon swathed from head to foot in volu-
minous black satin garments followed by
the two black slaves they prostrated


adventure

themselves before the sultan and then at
his command rose and waited in silence

  bring abd-es-selam now ordered the
sultan seating himself upon a divan near
the piles of treasure

  duakli called and in a moment the cap-
tain of the guards entered with the cham-
berlain

  abd-es-selam immediately upon enter-
ing caught sight of the two slaves his
footsteps faltered and his face grew pale
but paler still when he saw the treasure
scattered about in such profusion this
was the end except for a moment when he
should hear the whistle of the executioners
sword above his head the end unless
allah should inexphcably will it otherwise
with a bow which was scarcely obeisance he
stood before the sultan

  abd-es-selam said the monarch you
see your fate in the two slaves who stand
there there have told their stories do
you wish to deny them

  abd-es-selam shook his head

  there is no use your majesty

  you are guilty then with herr lang-
mann in the attempt upon our hfe

  guilty

  the word came through dry hps

  the penalty you know and you saidi
also

  abd-es-selam and the vizier nodded as-
sent

  still- the sultan paused a moment
as though debating you yourself re-
quested that allah be your judge is that
not true	

  abd-es-selam nodded disinterestedly

  therefore and at the request of our
friend mohamed ah who discovered your
plot and who saved our treasure from your
hands allah shall be your judge

  at these words the head of abd-es-selam
jerked upward and bewilderment doubt
suspicion each painted its imprint upon
his face his glance searched the room

  he mohamed ah is not here said the
sultan nevertheless it is as we said

  abd-es-selam looked incredulous now
and a tired and cynical smile twitched his
hps the sultan clapped his hands thrice
the dark curtains at one side of the room
were drawn back by unseen hands and
there standing side by side were two
bandaged beggars dressed in patched
djellabas bowls in hand so alike that each
seemed the reflection of the other

  the judgment of allah awaits you
said the sultan one of these beggars is
mohamed ali one you must choose if
allah guides your choice if the one whom
you select proves to be mohamed ah and
you shall remove the bandage yourself your
life is saved otherwise you die at sunset
now choose

  for a moment only abd-es-selam hesi-
tated looking at the sultan in his sov-
ereigns face he saw nothing but severe
honesty there was no trick here then
he looked again upon the beggars and smiled
grimly at the situation assuredly mo-
hamed ali and not the sultan had con-
ceived this form of trial it had in it all
the sardonic humor in the face of death for
which mohamed ali was known

  he drew nearer and nearer to the twin
beggars who looked at him out of two
unwinking eyes which were so mated they
seemed to belong in one head instead of two

  he looked at the bandages and they told
him nothing at the hands which held the
begging bowl and he knew not which was
mohamed alis and which was not at the
matted beards and full hps and patched
djellabas and realized that he might as well
choose with eyes closed assuredly here
was mohamed alis vengeance in full a
greater vengeance than death itself

  then something within his head snapped
he uttered a cry of allah akbar and
reaching with shackled hands tore the ban-
dage from the head of the beggar nearest his
right hand

  the white socket of a dead eye stared at
him

  allah has judged boomed the deep
voice of the other beggar and mohamed
ali wrenched the bandage from his own
head allah has judged as i had faith in
him

  a great silence filled the room abd-es-
selam slowly tore his gaze from the white
eye-socket looked upon mohamed ali
standing bandage in hand turned to face
the sultan who had risen and now stood like
a figure of white justice

  a llah akbar abd-es-selams voice tore
its way through a throat tight with fear and
anger and horrible pain allah-

  in that signal invented by his father
mulai el-hassan mulai abd-el-aziz shot
his underjaw forward the captain of the
guards obeyed the death sign and led his
prisoner from the presence
   our camp-fire came into being may   with our june issue and since then
its fire has never died down many have gathered about it and they are of all classes
and degrees high and low rich and poor adventurers and stay-at-homes and from all
parts of the earth some whose voices we used to know have talien the long trail
and are heard no more but they are still memories among us and new voices are
heard and welcomed

   we are drawn together by a common liking for the strong clean things of out-of-
doors for word from the earths far places for man in action instead of caged by cir-
cumstance the spirit of adventure lives in all men the rest is chance

   but something besides a common interest holds us together somehow a real com-
radeship has grown up among us men can not thus meet and talk together without
growing into friendlier relations many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts
and guidance many a close personal friendship has our camp-fire built up between
two men who had never met often has it proved an open sesame between strangers
in a far laud

    perhaps our camp-fire is even a little more perhaps it is a bit of leaven working
gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand-
ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood
he seeks few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing so many
and such great extremes as here and we are numbered by the hundred thousand now

    if you are come to our camp-fire for the first time and find you like the things we
like join us and find yourself very welcome there is no obligation except ordinary
manliness no forms or ceremonies no dues no officers no anything except men and
women gathered for interest and friendliness your desire to join makes you a member

if you want to know about
something that happened some-
where some time ask camp-
fire particularly if it happened
in some out-of-the-way corner of the
world quite possibly one of our com-
rades happened to be there or as in this
case several of them

          u s s savannah at sea enroute from
                    balboa c z to san diego

  will you allow me to say a few words to a comrade
of the camp-fire through these columns the let-
ter appeared in the february   issue sent
from empalme sonora mexico and signed a b c
and from what i know of that country i dont blame
him for not giving his name but if he was-there in
july and august  ill bet i know his name i
knew most every american then working in the s p
shops in empalme

  it may interest him to know that yesterday we
passed cape san lucas and at this minute we are
off turtle bay not far from him

vhat a b c says in regard to the bi-
plane attempting to bomb the guerrero is
true how well i knowi i was not over 
yards good torpedo range from the guerrero at the
line the rebels who were up in the hills back of

empalme were using field artillery to fire over the
shops and town trying to do their part to sink the
gunboat needless to say their range was rather
bum and it kept the ship i was in the good old u s
south dakota busy to keep out of the way of their
shells the captain of the guerrero who happened
to be a nervy englishman was one wise guy
every time we would shift anchorage he would too
to keep himself in between us and the shell fire of
the rebels i saw the four flights the biplane made
and the forced landing he had to make on the tide
flats between guaymas and empalme later on i got
ashore and took pictures of the plane and pilot
which i now have

  perhaps a b c will recall the time the
ball team from the s d played the workers
of the shops september i think this was
the writer played shortstop can you remem-
ber me also the time you lined up alongside
the bar in the corner saloon on the waterfront
in guaymas with a bunch of sailors from a boat
laying at the landing also the time of the
wholesale execution of  rebels lined up in front
of the albin hotel in guaymas yes i was
there for seven long months

  i am sorry i can not tell him what became of the
pilot and mechanic of the plane that was the last
time i heard of them

  hoping a b c gets this letter either through the
mail or the columns of camp-fire i remain-p l

adventure

seldom do i bring to camp-
fire any praise of our magazine
but here is one of our ask ad-
venture experts a member of
our writers brigade and good comrade at
our camp-fire who has done something
that brings credit not only to himself but
to ask adventure and here is another
man also qualified on ah three of the above
counts who in the real camp-fire spirit is
so pleased over the other comrades ac-
complishment that he takes time to tell us
all about it incidentally it was our first
news of it the man himself never letting out
a peep about it to us

  i pass it on because it makes me very
proud of our ask adventure depart-
ment through both mr harriman and mr
spears and through its other experts ani-
mated by the same spirit and because in
various ways it illustrates our camp-fire
spirit and feeling-which the world needs
very badly these days

  the enclosure was two full pages from
the los angeles sunday times naming e
e harriman as winner of its thousand dol-
lar prize for the best friendly letter in its
friendship contest a contest whose pur-
pose was to make friends for cahfornia
over  letters were written

 here is the letter from raymond s
spears

inglewood california

  my dear hoffman  cast your eyes upon the en-
closed clipping depicting big jim harriman as the
friendliest letter writer in california

  ive preached you these many years you could
not quite know the good ask adventure is doing
see me pat my own back and here the big fellow
comes rambling down the line to show what writing
ask adventure letters with kindly spirit and sin-
cere desire has done for one of your ask adven-
ture company

  probably none of us quite so thoroughly realize
the responsibility that lies in each letter answered
as big jim i doubt not at all that he has written
even more thoroughly from the heart-not knowing
he was doing so well of course-to some boy or man
some family who came through adventure to his
desk seeking to know

  this proves i think many things harriman
did his letters every one the best he knew drudg-
ery pot-boiling odd jobbing in literature
ephemeral and so-many cents the letter well he
put the same effort into the letter as into his best
of stories he plodded along never knowing what
he was doing to himself thinking only of those
people out yonder who were putting into his hands
part of all their future

  even as life rewards the doers of the least things
well and who knows what is great harriman lets
go the accumulated inspirations and ideas data
of the years gathering and look what he got

imagine what it means-the friendliest letter
writer of california takes something to top a
grade of more than  letters and they
didnt know him here for years he has been
plodding along unadvertised plugging patient
and sincere and what he has given the hundreds
of ask adventure inquirers proves to be the real
thing adventure gives the best california has to offer
what do you think of that yours-spears

the following was originally the
first chapter of george e holts
complete novelette in this issue
but his suggestion that it be used
instead at camp-fire seemed a good one
since it is occupied altogether with what
might be called facts antecedent to the story
itself so here it is

ensenada b c mexico

  in beginning this story i should much like to set
aside for a little space restrictions as to probabil-
ities and boldly set down what i feel to be the truth
in the matter but as this course would demand
the reincarnation of two once-prominent men after
they had died rather thoroughly some four or five
thousand years ago prudence counsels that my
opinions be kept to myself this however does
not preclude me i think from setting forth certain
facts nor you from drawing your own conclusions
therefrom

     ow certain of these facts are very very old
and as the memory of them has been preserved
through forty or fifty centuries by the minds and
tongues of man they must also be very very true
and it is with these venerable and truthful matters
that this twentieth-century story really begins

  in any volume of mythology--which of course is
only a modern record of the oldest half-remembered
events of importance in the worlds youth-you will
assuredly find some pages devoted to the exploits
of a certain man and most probably a wood-cut
showing an astonishingly muscled gentleman lean-
ing gracefully upon a war-club of imposing propor-
tions that will be hercules and the book will tell
you that he was son of alcmena wife of amphyt-
ryon his father the book will also go on to tell
you regarless of the fair name of the inconstant
alcmena was not mr amphytryon however but
jupiter himself king of all the gods the city of
thebes was his birthplace and between his birth and
his death in the flaming shirt of nessus hercules no
doubt packed more adventure than any other char-
acter known to man wherefore he became almost
a god

tith most of these adventures we have no
concern but one or two of them have a bear-
ing upon our story hercules reached manhood and
became the father of three children but one day
juno spouse of jupiter and consequently jealous of
the illegitimate offspring of the king of the gods
made hercules insane and in his fit of madness he
threw his children into the fire and so destroyed them
regaining his senses then hercules journeyed to
delphi to consult the famous oracle concerning
atonement for his crime the oracle ordained that
the camp-fire



he should go to a place called tiryno in the pele-
ponnesus and there serve king eurystheus for a
space of twelve years accomplishing therein twelve
tasks which the king should impose upon him
obeying the oracle hercules became the servant of
king eurystheus and his twelve tasks became
famous enough to rank among students of the
present day with the seven wise men the ten
commandments and the fourteen points and
two of them quite directly through a course of
four or five thousand years made possible or in-
evitable certain other matters

t n performing his tenth task-that of bring-
ing from the isle of erythea the purple oxen of
geryon hercules according to the record was
come to the extremities of europe and africa and
here he set up two pillars one on each side of the
strait we call one pillar gibraltar which the
moors named djibel tarik and that other peak on
the moroccan coast djibel musa or hill of moses

  back to this same region did hercules eleventh
task take him he was to fetch to eurystheus the
apples of hesperides which grew in the country of
the hyperboreans there they were guarded by an
enormous serpent and by the hesperides western
maids who were the daughters of atlas there
apples were of gold and they had been given by
earth to juno on her wedding day

  now the book will not tell you what is also
true that this country of the hyperboreans was
morocco wherein the mountains of atlas uphold
the heavens nor that the native name of morocco is
moghreb-al-acksa which means land of the
west and that thus the hesperides or western
maids came by their name nor that the golden
apples still grow in profusion in the orange groves
round about el arache-sixty miles down the west
moroccan coast where the great serpent or as it
is sometimes written foaming-mouthed dragon
still guards them or did when i followed in the
tracks of hercules this same serpent is the kus
river which after snaking its way through great
stretches of flat country visible from the hills like a
gigantic silver-scaled thing froths viciously at the
bar which the sea has thrown in its teeth

tj aving reached the land wherein the golden
apples grew many obstacles rose in the road
of our adventurer he found-and this fact con-
cerns us intimately-he found according to the
book that the land was governed by a king named
antaeus son of neptune and earth being chal-
lenged by antaeus to a wrestling match hercules
threw him several times but each time antaeus rose
with a vigor renewed through contact with his
mother earth discovering this hercules held
him in his arms and squeezed him to death

  but again the book omits facts of interest the
city in which king antaeus reigned is that we now
know as tangier and hercules so named it-tan-
jerah to be exact-after he became successor to
antaeus and although the book is silent on this
point also hercules left descendants among the
people of antaeus they live today among those
purple brown hills east of tangier in a territory
which is called by them anjerah-the t having f
been dropped-and they call themselves sons of
hercules mohamed ali who became known as
the eagle of the anjerahs was and is the great-
est of them i who lived among them for a while

and by a quip of fate became one of their lesser
chiefs know them for a brave people a bold people
an independent people as becomes the descendants
of such a one as hercules

  thus i think the line is drawn clear connecting
the master adventurer of earths childhood and
mohamed ali anjerah chieftain-and as you may
know politician governor and outlaw

jn the same manner-but it is unnecessary-
could i show how through fifty centuries the line
ran from king eurystheus to a modern monarch
abd-el-aziz sultan of morocco at the time of which
i write for hercules secured the golden apples
and carried them to eurystheus and they fell into
the hands of one of the kings sons who seeking
more of them fell in love with one of the western
maids and thus left blood which came down
through the centuries to the veins of the moorish
sultan

  here i must stop lest i reach my prohibited con-
clusion still i think it a strange coincidence in-
deed that five thousand years ago hercules per-
formed twelve tasks for king eurystheus and that
in our own day a lineal descendant of his should be
called upon for another-the thirteenth-task by a
king descended from eurystheus

  but such a thing happened-and the manner of it
you shall see-george e holt

something from l paul con-

rr cerning his story in the last issue
plgpllh im glad corporal hawkins got
i	his chance in fiction and heres

hoping he got it in real hfe and fared
equally well there are many of him if
only we look about a bit

  the central figure of corporal hawkins is from
hfe i met him while taking the guards infantry
course at chelsea barracks london-a smartening
up affair where they drilled us a hundred and eighty
paces to the minute he was a man with the heart
of a pioneer though so far as i am aware his life had
been passed in england until the war when we
colonials would tell our little yarns of our respective
homelands he would listen wide-eyed and you could
tell he was longing to be in canada or australia as
the case might be longing till it hurt

co i have taken such a man and mixed him up
with an old trapper in northern canada and i
hope the story suits i have tried as much as pos-
sible to keep away from the hair-raising events so
often grafted on these stories i feel that where two
men are cooped up together for a winter there is
enough humor-yes and sometimes enough trag-
edy-found in minutiae without going outside of fact
into fiction of course the moose incident is not
included in this category

  with regard to the stunt of putting cocoa into a
cake after the careless constructor has dropped pipe
ashes therein it too is from hfe some such base
slander being chalked against me when four of us
batched it in ottawa one winter

  for the rest i have tried to stick to fact and true
description i hope i have succeeded-l paul

adventure

as a christmas greeting the
northern railway issued a very
effectively ihustrated little book-
let entitled the oriental and
captain palmer comrade chet g
wood ran across it and was good enough to
send me a copy i liked it so well that i
wrote at once for two copies one to send to
bill adams because i knew hed hke it and
one to be printed in camp-fire our
thanks are due the great northern for their
courtesy

  acknowledgement in the brochure is
made to mrs richard fanning loper of
stonington conn captain palmers niece
and to major-general a w greely edwin
s balch william brown meloney arthur
hamilton clark and john r spears as
sources of the information in the booklet

por centuries the rich trade goods of india-
gold ivory and rubies spices perfumes ilks
light as gossamer linen and finespun cotton cloths
the wools of cashmere-have been sought by the
eager markets of the world long caravans of
camels plodded across the plains and deserts and
through the mountain passes of asia minor to the
peoples of the mediterranean and we see three
mounted wise men carrying the rich tribute of the
orient to a manager in bethlehem as the cities
f southern europe grew the trade with the east
waxed larger and larger it was carried on by ship
and caravan through the gulf of persia thence over-
land by bagdad damascus and constantinople

   while christopher columbus was a little boy in
genoa something happened that led to revolution-
ary changes in the world although at the time 
it seemed a great disaster this was the closing by
the turks of these immemorial highways of com-
merce across asia minor the mariners of italy
portugal and spain were called upon to find other
routes to india they followed around the east
coast of africa but their ships were very small the
sea was unexplored and reputed to be filled with
horrid monsters and strange lands where evil
spirits lurked so it was long before they touched the
cape of good hope  and ten years later when
they reached india by that route

   columbus having little idea of the earths size
but knowing it was round reasoned that by sailing
directly west he would find a shorter and perhaps a
more favorable course he died without learning
that he had discovered a continent which blocked
the way for the next three hundred years the
dream of navigators was to find a passage north of
america through the arctic sea to the orient

as the outlines of the continents took form on
the marine maps of the world it was seen that
to go from the atlantic to the pacific ships must
round cape horn or the cape of good hope the
length of the journey and the growth of commerce in
the new world as well as the old led to the building
of larger and faster vessels the santa maria
largest of columbuss three ships was of about 
tons and some  feet long from that time until

the revolutionary war the size and standard of
ships was not much improved following the war
the abundance of timber superior for shipbuilding
and the opportunities afforded by virtue of their
new born independence combined to encourage the
native genius of american shipbuilders they
bought out models with new lines and fitted them
with more and better sails

qur maritime prowess won for us the war of
 and that victory in turn gave further
stimulus to advancing skill in naval architecture
from these influences came the clipper ships-so
named because they clipped it down the wind
fast like a bird in flight the first true clippers
were the hoitqua and the rainbow launched in new
york harbor in  and  hundreds of
american ships following their lines were built to
meet the demand for their unrivaled service

  improvements followed and in  in new
york a clipper ship was built which embodied the
perfection of her type she was christened oriental
and was built to bear the precious trade of asia the
oldest traffic known to commerce her first voy-
ages were between new york and hongkong but in
 the east india trade with great britain was
opened to the ships of other nations and as this
trade was the most desirable it went to the finest
and fleetest ships so in december  the
oriental brought to london the first cargo ever
carried there from china in an american ship
perhaps she had in her hold many gifts for the ap-
proaching christmas season the oriental already
had made new york from hongkong in  days and
returned to hongkong in like time now she made
london from hongkong in  days notwithstand-
ing adverse weather her arrival was a sensation
crowds thronged to the docks to see the long slender
hull of this earliest of ocean grayhounds her lofty
masts that towered like spires above the dwarfed
shipping of the yard the wealth of furled white
canvas that had carried her down the winds with
such unheard of speed to the editorial writers of
the day she was a wonder a menace and a chal-
lenge we must run a race with our gigantic and
unshackled rival a fell necessity constrains us
and we must not be beat london times the
london illustrated news published a picture of the
oriental and an article part of which reads as fol-
lows although many british ships have arrived
at new york and boston from china since the
alteration in the navigation laws the first american
ship the oriental arrived in the west india docks
on the rd instant and has made the fastest voyage
on record from china by a sailing vessel we
should add that the oriental brings about  tons
of tea at  per ton whilst all the ships loading at
whampoa cantons seaport at the same time
only got  s correspondents availed them-
selves of the opportunity even at such a high rate of
freight the oriental being known for her fast sailing
qualities which she fully verified she was of
average size although the later tendency was to
build larger vessels her length was  feet
breadth  feet and depth  feet william brown
meloney in the heritage of tyre says she was
the first out and out clipper london ever saw
the british admiralty copied her lines while she lay
in dry dock afterward the lines of other yankee
flyers were taken off similarly but the oriental was
the first inspiration of british builders
the camp-fire



qhe not only received formal acclaim from the

  generous and sportsmanlike english but was
welcomed also by a group of americans with the
most precious of all greetings that of genuine af-
fection heading this group was her own designer
the celebrated captain nathaniel brown palmer
leader in the american shipping world

  captain palmer was born in stonington con-
necticut in  it is needless to speculate upon
the relative importance of inheritance and environ-
ment in molding his character for he enjoyed the
greatest favor in both his boyhood was spent
playing about his fathers shipyard and listening
to tales of sailors whose very presence for repairs to
battered hulls proved the adventure of the trips
they made ship models were his only toys the
ambitions and dreams of seafaring men took the
place of the usual fairy-tales withal the atmos-
phere of home was one of culture for his parents
came from the best new england stock and his
father was established in a shipyard of highest repu-
tation to distinguish him from his father for
whom he was named he was called nat in his boy-
hood a name which clung to him throughout his
career while nat was growing up the young re-
public was developing and expanding on sea as well
as on land young nat could hardly wait to an-
swer the call of the sea which promised so much of
adventure fame and fortune he did not long re-
sist it for at fifteen years of age we find him on a
blockade runner dodging the british navy in the
fogs of long island and new england at the close
of the war he continued in the coastwise trade
the experience thus gained in all conditions of
weather with no landmarks to guide him and his
proved seamanship won him a place in  as
mate of a picked crew for a sealing expedition to the
south shetland islands his resourcefulness and
sound judgment together with downright hard
work were rewarded in  by his being made cap-
tain of the hero a fifty-foot sloop used as a cruiser
with a sealing fleet in the antarctic

yhile thus engaged in  the intrepidity of
captain nat took him beyond the limits of
charted waters among gale-driven ice floes and
treacherous shoals and led to his discovery of part of
the antarctic continent the nonchalance with
which unusual feats constantly were performed by
crews of these small sailing ships characterized cap-
tain palmers conduct when to the surprise of the
famous russian explorer bellingshausen the hero
was encountered along these shores captain nat
extended the hospitality of the region to the russian
and offered to show him about commander bel-
lingshausen was most generous with the young
american although he declared himself abashed at
having spent two years searching for the continent
only to find that a boy in a sloop but httle larger
than the launch of the russian frigate had not only
beaten him to the place but was able to guide him
safely among the islands he thereupon gave to
this shore the name palmer land which it bears
to this day

  the power of captain palmers presence is
forcefully shown in a critical experience on the
island of juan fernandez in  as he went
ashore for fresh provisions he was ambushed by
some of the chilean convicts who had overpowered
the prison guard and taken possession of the island
they decided to seize his ship the annawan and

proposed first to kill him as they were blind-fold-
ing him for execution he persuaded them to spare
him so that he might convey them to the chilean
mainland once aboard ship with this cut-throat
mob he asserted his dominance and held them at
bay during ten days of extended calm which pre-
vented an earlier landing

  captain nat was now  years old and in the full
flower of manhood his reputation for daring sea-
manship and diplomacy won him command of an
atlantic packet he shortly demonstrated his out-
standing qualities and until  was commodore of
the dramatic line fleet plying between new york
and liverpool now in the ripeness of his experi-
ence he came into his own as designer of these fine
packets he gained a high reputation it was his
practise to make the initial journey on each of the
ships when it was launched and thus he put into
service the garrick sheridan siddons and roscius
in october  he sailed the siddons between
liverpool and new york in fifteen days the shortest
known westbound record for sailing vessels between
those ports

jdut merchant-sailing vessels had not been per-
fected the need of larger and faster ships
led to the development of the clippers which differed
from former models in that they were longer in pro-
portion to their breadth and carried greater spread
of canvas the opening of four chinese ports in
 spurred the building captain nats answer
to the call was the launching of the houqua in 
earliest of all the clipper ships the perfection of
the clipper type was attained in the oriental then
followed other notable examples of captain palmers
skill the n b palmer samuel russel golden state
david brown and contest as the combination of
capacity with speed resulted in most efficient trans-
portation and as the possibilities of speed seemed to
have been well nigh exhausted captain palmer
dreamed of larger ships his dream was realized
in the rebuilding of the great republic  feet long
with capacity of six thousand tons the largest sail-
ing vessel ever built of wood this ship originally
built by donald mckay in  burned in new
york harbor without making a voyage she was
purchased and rebuilt by captain palmer but
commerce was not ready for so large a ship and she
was sold to the french government for a transport
in the crimean war this ended the most active
period in captain palmers life slowly but surely
the steamship was replacing the sailing vessel

  captain palmer in his later years designed and
sailed many of new yorks most beautiful yachts
his interest in shipping was kept alive in his associ-
ation with the new york yacht club of which he
was one of the founders

  he died in -one of americas great men of
action the list is long and its names are the mile-
posts of our progress they are men whose imagi-
nation encompasses the present and foresees the
future need and whose vigor of mind creates the
means to fill that need

  james j hill was such a man nathaniel brown
palmer devised the fastest ships to go around the
continent and james j hill built the shortest route
across it but back of captain palmers ships and
mr hills locomotives was the unerring intuition
that pointed to rapid and effectual transportation as
the very keystone in the great modern arch of
human advancement

       from ralph r perry a few
words concerning the actual facts
back of his story in this issue it
always adds to our interest in a
story i think to have a ghmpse of the
real materials from which it is made i
wish our writers gave it oftener but theres
a fear among them that they may seem to
talk too often at camp-fire yes but how
about the rest of us why not give us a
chance to decide about that

hempstead new york

  it was a real ship the british steamer nigaristan
that made the voyage related in five pounds per
ton bonus the american public was clamoring
for dates and this tremendous bonus was actually
paid after the ships arrival in the bush terminal
about the th of last october to earn it she had
to steam from basra at a knot and a half average
over her standard speed and there was another com-
pany moving heaven and earth to get the charter

  the events in the engineroom are of course fic-
titious though i am indebted to a mr symthe
third officer of the nigaristan for telling me what a
disloyal engineer would actually do under the con-
ditions outlined-ralph r perry

you may remember my having
presented to camp-fire a modern
bowyer and fletcher because of
the novelty and picturesqueness
of such a trade in these ultra modern days
which are the modemest weve had up to
date to avoid any seeming favoritism in
thus giving free advertisement i offered
to do as much for any other bowyers and
fletchers who might be among us two
more have already apphed and been men-
tioned and here comes a third-h h
mcchesney  portland avenue min-
neapolis minn

  but of the four mr stemmier is the only
one to blazen forth those arresting words
bowyer and fletcher all of them
however make bows and arrows and pre-
sent pictures of bears deer etc brought
down by same

tts just as well to note these names
carefully if the fanatics and their
various calculating allies with irons of their
own in the fire succeed in their present anti-
weapon campaign bows and arrows canes
and such will be the only means of self-
defense left to us free-born and liberty lov-
ing americans with all the modern weapons
in possession of other nations and of the
crooks and thugs in our midst of course
theyd soon legislate bows and arrows and
canes and such away from us and proba-

bly if they follow a logical course our
right and left hands as well but wed
enjoy having ah these things as long as we
were permitted

  one reason im against the anti-weapon
people is that theyre not consistent or logi-
cal or thorough their fundamental prin-
cipal is that the proper way to prevent
crime is to legislate against the weapons
or tools of crime weh that principle is
either sound or not sound if not sound
its no good if sound it certainly merits
full logical development and application
why legislate at firearms only why make
petty laws against only one kind of weapon
used for hold-ups and killings

hpo stop there is shp-shod amateurish
careless illogical and reprehensible
generally knives of ah kinds from butch-
er to pen must go all clubs of all kinds
including table and chair legs and all other
detachable parts of furniture or anything
else ah trees of course must be legislated
out of existence-forbidden destroyed
a stones and bricks should be collected
from the surface of the united states from
all walls not in a-i condition and from at
least six feet below the surface of the ground
and then placed in the custody of the police
for safe keeping or to be reduced and de-
stroyed by said police

  murderous tools like axes hatchets picks
shovels hoes rakes chisels screw-drivers
scissors table forks large nails etc must
of course be legislated beyond the use or
possession of good citizens though cer-
tain highly certificated workmen could
be granted special police permits to
use said tools on payment of generous
fees and upon bonded agreement to de-
posit said tools each night in custody
of said pohce paying more fees for
privilege of doing same

  the use of metal for any purpose what-
ever should be similarly safe-guarded by
pohce supervision and control why legis-
late against weapons and leave free to ah
the material from which to make weapons

t ut even ah these legislative precautions
can not be sufficient to carry to its
logical development and full application
the principle of preventing crime by legislat-
ing against the weapons and tools of crime
of what avail to legislate against the weap-
ons and tools or even against the materials
the camp-fire	

from which they can be easily made if we fail
to legislate against the bands that wield the
tools where pray can you draw a logical
line for stopping legislation short of includ-
ing the hands as well as what they handle

  nor will it be enough to cut off and de-
posit with the police on payment of fee
for same the right hands of right-handed
people and the left hands of left-handed
people both hands must be removed
and deposited where they can no longer
endanger the public safety

  the foot having often proved a lethal weap-
on all feet of all americans must be removed
not later than the twelfth birthday in the
case of males sixteenth in case of females

t ut even then the principle would not be
fully developed or applied with the
logical thoroughness that alone can attain
really practical results there remain the
brains that inspire and move the hands that
fashion the material into weapons and
wield said weapons to the furtherance of
crime and the endangerment of public
safety and security unrestricted and un-
removed by proper legislative action the
human brain remains a danger and a menace
in our midst so long as it so remains our
preliminary legislation against weapons
materials hands and feet gets us really
nowhere-merely compels a change in the
ways and means of taking hfe and leaves
still at large and unrestrained the very source
and inspiration of ah crimes of violence

  nor is the brain left without its weapons
how easy despite the lack of hands and feet
to roll into a footless victim standing on the
edge of a precipice or house-top or at the edge
of traffic and bump him to his death

	i here must be no half-way measures

     the human brain must be legislated
into harmlessness no american must be
ahowed to have a brain without having
first obtained from the pohce a permit to
possess same on payment of a fee preferably
large enough to discourage indiscriminate
having of brains and to limit in effect
but unobtrusively the privilege of having
brains to only the richer part of our popula-
tion in addition to a permit to possess a
brain the present new york law might well
be emulated and a second permit required
with payment of a second fee to the pohce
for the privilege of carrying said brain when
entitled to possession of same with a third

permit this time from the fire department
on payment of a third fee permitting you
not only to possess and carry but to shoot
off said brain within the city limits

vt or has public safety even yet been
assured by legislation knowing the
corruptness of our officialdom we can not
blink the fact that brain-permits might
in some cases be issued to wrong parties
provided the fee were duly paid the real
essence of the fundamental principle of
preventing crime by legislation against the
means of committing crime is removal of
said means removal means removal
in this campaign for safety against the
means of crime there can be no logical
stopping-place short of removal of ah
brains the only practical method where
so great a population is involved is to re-
move the head at the neck the only
logical final and safe conclusion of the anti-
weapon campaign therefore is the guillo-
tine for all americans with brains of any
kind by it most americans will be re-
moved and the land of the free be left en-
tirely in possession of the anti-weaponers
none of the beheaded since they have
brains will object to being beheaded in-
stead of being left to hve in a country popu-
lated by anti-weaponers with the legislative
complex everybody will be happy and
safe its a fine plan logically developed
from a noble and highly practical principle
and im for it what i object to in the
anti-weapon campaign is that it stops
short of this entirely logical conclusion
and is therefore unscientific careless in-
efficient and half-baked the principle
its founded on is fine-a s h

our camp-fire stations are spreading
steadily over the map help make
them grow any qualified person can start
a station

a station may be in any shop home or
other reputable place the only require-
ments are that a station shall display the
regular station sign provide a box or drawer
for mail to be called for and preserve the
register book

   no responsibility for mail is assumed by anybody the
station merely uses ordinary care entries in register to be
confined to name or serial number route destination
permanent address and such other brief notes or remarks as
desired each station can impose its own limit on space to
be used registers become permanent property of station
signs remain property of this magazine so that if there is
due cause of complaint from members a station can be
discontinued by withdrawing sign

   a station bulletin-board is strongly to be recommended
as almost necessary on it travelers can leave tips as to
conditions of trails etc resident members can post their
adventure

names and addresses such hospitality as they care to offer
calls for any travelers who are familiar with countries these
residents once knew calls for particular men if they happen
that way etc notices or tips about local facilities and con-
ditions letters to resident members can be posted on this
bulletin board

any one who wishes is a member of camp-fire and
therefore entitled to the above station privileges subject to
the keepers discretion those offering hospitality of any
kind do so on their own responsibility and at their own risk
and can therefore make any discriminations they see fit
traveling members will naturally be expected to remember
that they are merely guests and act accordingly

keepers answer letters only if they wish forjocal
information write ask adventure

      a station may offer only the required register and mail
facilities or enlarge its scope to any degree it pleases its
possibilities as headquarters for a local club of resident
camp-fire members are excellent

      the only connection between a station and this magazine
is that stated above and a keeper is in no other way re-
sponsible to this magazine nor representative of it

  	would you consider the country safe at the
present time for a young woman to travel alone
am keeping in mind the possibility of some internal
troubles arising as is often the case in the balkans

  i have relatives scattered about slavonia and
would naturally stay with them thereby cutting
down somewhat my expenses any other informa-
tion will be appreciated-louise coykich
youngstown o

  reply by lieut jenna- i believe that 
would be sufficient to cover your expenses from your
present home to agram and back and keep you quite
comfortably while there

  	you will encounter a certain amount of diffi-
culty in going from one small town to another but
you will have practically none in going between
large towns

  	upon your arrival in agram zagreb it would
be advisable to report to the american consul there
and register he would give you lots of good advice
concerning your passport and could also give you
lots of information concerning travel conditions and


adventure

i am sure that you would find him very willing to
assist you in any way that he could

  	as far as traveling is concerned i believe that
you would be perfectly safe going anywhere in jugo-
slavia you will find i believe no internal troubles
of such an extent that they would make traveling
at all precarious

  now that i have specifically answered your ques-
tions i shall add a few informal remarks concerning
the trip i believe that there are u s shipping
board boats plying between the united states and
europe on which it is possible to travel at a much
reduced rate i believe that the st class rate be-
tween new york and england is something like
 dont you think it would be a good idea for
you to write to the chairman of the u s ship-
ping board in new york and get some information
relative to travel rates on their steamships

  also have you decided what route you will take
if you go through france landing at some french
port you have before you an expensive train trip
to agram have you thought of going to some
adriatic port if you went to trieste you would
have but a short trip to agram and i believe you
will find boats plying directly between new york
and trieste you could probably save a fair amount
of money that way once you get there i believe
that you will find that the living expenses are really
very reasonable zagreb which i believe is the
after-war name for agram is quite a railroad center
and you could go anywhere in the jugo-slav king-
dom from there without any material difficulty

  by the way i neglected to state definitely that
there is an american consul in zagreb when i was
over there the consul was a mr thompson i con-
sidered him a very nice man and like him im-
mensely

  when i left jugo-slavia in  the country was
very quiet and peaceful there were no internal
troubles at all and the country was getting on a more
solid footing all the time i think that you will find
the conditions there now even better than in 
the only thing that i have noticed recently is a
small argument between jugo-slavia and bulgaria
and i believe you will find that that will finally
die a natural death the serbs dont want war
they want peace and they are you will find a very
peaceful and calm people whom i admire greatly

  i dont know that there is so much more that i
can tell you which would be of any great value to
you as far as planning your trip is concerned if
there is anything else however which i can tell you
do not hesitate to ask i shall be very glad to help
in any way at all

death valley

     the hottest place on the continent
in summer and cold as blazes in
winter

  request-would you please tell me where i can
obtain some information about death valley
what is the nearest railroad point to it and has it
been explored-ivan j dill stockton calif

  reply by mr harriman-i can give you pointers
on death valley it lies between the amargosa
and panamint mountains along the eastern line of
california it is  feet below sea level and about

seventy-five miles long

  it is the hottest place on this continent in summer
having a record of  degrees above zero in win-
ter the rawest cold winds imaginable blow through
it many people have lost their lives in this valley

  in summer the air is so dry that a blanket soaked
in water and hung on a line will be totally dry in half
an hour a man must drink as often as every half
hour to keep alive at furnace creek ranch the
hens wade in the irrigating ditch and squat in the
water the corral containing cows mules and
horses has sheet iron nailed on its fence to protect
the animals from hot winds only one man has
been able to endure the heat more than three sum-
mers and he did it by sleeping in water at night

  shoshone on the tidewater  tonopah ry is the
nearest station

  death valley has been explored by hundreds of
prospectors who went there in cool weather in the
fall or early spring

  one of my personal friends built an ore mill there
and had to tie his shack to two heavy motor trucks
to keep it from being wrecked by a high wind he

says it is-at any season and only fools go there

he declares he ought to know having gone there
himself many times which proves his contention
he declares he has never doubted his own folly since
his first trip into the valley

  two women went there in cool weather driving a
big automobile and wrote a book about the trip
a young acquaintance of mine flew there in an air-
plane to photograph the valley for the national
geographic magazine

  i know not less than five men right now who have
been there of late and they all damn the valley to
the limit

  it is full of chemical salts

samoans

well set up athletic and religious

  question-i would like to ask you a few ques-
tions about the south sea islands i am a united
states navy man serving on board the u s s
oklahoma i would like you to give me all the
general information you can on the samoan islands
marquesas islands and all islands either owned or
under the control of the united states what
chances are there for a white man to make money
honestly in the islands

  how do the natives live and dress how do the
americans live and dress

  i understand the men of these islands are very
much physically fit is that so

  are they fond of sports of all kinds what is
their favorite sport are they good boxers
wrestlers

  what kind of dwellings do the natives live in

  are there any minerals and oil in these islands

  what are the customs of the natives

  what different kinds of agriculture crops are raised
in these islands

  are there many american farmers

  i will appreciate very much any other informa-
tion you can give me on these islands especially
those either owned or under control of the united
ask adventure



states-frank powell care of postmaster san
francisco calif

  answer by mr mills-hats off and hands across
the sea to the gob you have issued a large order
but thanks be it is not so large as you imagine it
to be for outside of hawaii the samoas are the
only islands in the south sea that concern my an-
swer to you as america has some of the samoan
group new zealand having the mandate over the
rest which we took from the germans you can
get far more and better information than i can give
you regarding american samoa by writing to the
superintendent of public documents washington
d c or to the department of commerce same
city-with a request for its publications on samoa

  now for your questions a white man can make
money in the islands just according to the way he
goes about it and on the understanding that money
plus energy and industry makes money the
samoans dress much more simply than do the white
folks who dress in whites-silk duck or linen

  the samoans are the finest set-up men physically
on this footstool and they keep fit with the open
air and life on the sea probably in your group of
the islands the samoans are baseballers in our
group they became so devoted to cricket that they
knocked off work to play the game matches be-
tween villages lasting weeks at a time playing six
out of the seven days-for the samoans are deeply
religious christian at that so obsessed ware they
with cricket that ordinances had to be passed to
limit the time of playing it they do not box but
they wrestle some-catch as catch can

  the dwellings of the natives are thatch wheres
r huts of the whites lumber there are neither
minerals nor oil in samoa wild pigs are abundant

  what do you mean by customs they are of
clean habits mentally and physically and idolatry
has gone out they have superstitions of course
even americans in nebraska have those-and they
have native dances

  the principal crops for export are cocoa copra-
the dried kernel of the cocoanut-and a little rubber
if you follow this up by writing to the commerce
department in washington you will get right on to
the ground floor in the way of island information

             kia ora native for good luck

big game in the arctic

      good hunting off the coast of
      siberia

  request-i am interested in arctic life and
nunting in the north and if you will answer the
questions below you can help me a lot

  i am most interested in seals and polar bears
so will limit my questions to these two species

  are there any seals and polar bears in northern
siberia if so where

  are there any laws prohibiting the hunting of said
animals

  what would you include in your pack for an
expedition lasting four or five months

  any other information would be appreciated-
byron ogle desoto mo

  reply by mr oliver-there are hair seals all
along the north coast of siberia skins can be pur-
chased for about twenty-five cents in trade they

are rather hard to kill all you have for a target is
the seals head above water polar bears are always
found on the ice floes and are hard to kill because
they are so wary the islands north of siberia
between chaun bay and the kolyma are reputed to
be so thick with polar bears that it is dangerous for
a man to go there

  a four or five months trip into the arctic would
mean in the summer and you would need nothing
outside of ordinary clothes because the sun shines
twenty-four hours a day so you will be plenty warm

  why dont you take a trip from nome along the
north coast you could also include walrus they
are lots of sport and their tusks would help pay
expenses it takes a big game rifle to kill them

  the only law i know against killing any of the
above animals is that you must not kill walrus on
the beach it is one of the native superstitions but
is respected and enforced by the authorities

the opossums diet

a marsupial with a taste for
young chicken

  request-right here is where i learn something
-or rather unlearn something that i thought i had
learned a good many years ago

  in the december th number of adventure there
is a copy of a letter from you to mr jas a hale of
el paso in which you refer to the opossum as a
meat-eating animal

  a good many years ago my brother and i were as
all kids are prone to make a pet of every kind of
animal we could lay hands on among these un-
fortunate victims was a young possum and that
fellow all the time we had him would eat any kind
of vegetable cooked or raw also any kind of fruit
but he wouldnt touch meat either cooked or raw

  my brittanica refers to this particular species-
as nearly as i can figure it-as didelphys marsupialis
and says that they eat insects maybe they do we
never tried our possum on insects

  now then what was the matter with our victim
i have hunted a good deal in various parts of texas
and have seen a number of possums and they seem
to be the same kind we had in our country as kids
that is in eastern kansas

  and here is an extra stamp or so to make up for
those some other people fail to enclose-h r
laudermilk

  reply by mr whiteaker-if you had had as
many hen nests young chickens and hens also de-
stroyed by opossums as i have had you would not
deny the fact that opossums eat flesh something
must be left out of your brittanica about the
opossum look again or consult some book of
natural history youll find a great deal more
about the opossum than you mentioned in your
letter to me the opossum was the first marsupial
animal known

  these animals abound in the warmer parts of
north america its form is robust its head very
large its color dull white its fur long fine and
wooly thickly interspersed with longer coarse white
hairs except on the head and some of the upper
parts where the hair is short and close the tail
is not quite so long as the body it lives much in
forests and among branches of trees to which it
usually retreats to devour its prey twining its tail
around a branch for security
adventure

  many a time have we gone possum hunting in the
late fall about the first frost they are very fond
of persimmons and you can usually find one or more
in one of these trees after a frost the frost ripens
the persimmons and cause them to fall to the ground
with a good possum dog one can bag as many as
three or four in a night possum and sweet pota-
toes make a fine dish for some but i am not par-
ticularly fond of it myself

  its food consists of small quadrupeds and reptiles
birds eggs and insects also fruits and the juicy
parts of plants it is easily tamed but its odor
makes it an unpleasant pet it often visits poultry
yards and is cunning in its quest of prey it feigns
death under very trying circumstances often being
kicked and beaten or shook by a dog without a sign
of life the true state of the affair can be ascertained
though by throwing it into water

  the female sometimes produce as many as six-
teen at a birth the young when born are blind
naked and shapeless weighing about a grain each
they do not leave the pouch until they are about the
size of a mouse indian women often weave the
hair of the opossum into garters and girdles and sell
them to tourists

  thanks for the extra stamp it will come in
handy for quite a number of my correspondents
forget to enclose postage glad that you wrote and
come again sometime always glad to get letters
from readers of adventure if there is anything else
that you wish to know about the territory that i
am covering for adventure do not hesitate to write

 automobiling in colombia

it cant be done but the scenerys
grand

  request-if i may presume it seems to me that
we are brothers under our skins knew a fellow
named john parr extra gang-foreman and all round
track man on the construction of the united verde
extension road and smelter in arizona who knew
you on the s p construction in mexico

  my old man had a contract on the same con-
struction from orendain to tequila that is a por-
tion from this side of amatitan to the other side
ive been in guatemala for some three years and
heard of you there but cant recollect just who it was

  i was with the international railways of central
america until a few months after the death of mr
a clark of mexican national railways fame my
father came out of mexico with the revolution was
on the northwestern of mexico construction in 
since  he has been superintendent of the -c
railway at cananea sonora mexico and for three
years prior to the war i was trainmaster there

  both of us are t t ts i guess im an irre-
concilable the boss is taking a long rest and we
have talked each other into making an extended
tour of south america hes a veteran automobile
tourist and camper having made yearly trips to
california and the northwest and if it is at all
practicable well take a machine-a dodge special
which is the burro of automotive transportation
so after having tried to get on your good side in
true latin fashion ill attempt to get something out
of you

  how about the following if consistent

roads in colombia and chile when does the
winter set in down there and is it severe enough to

hamper overland transportation somewhere i
have gathered the impression that the summer in
the u s is winter down there and that it gets pretty
cold up in the highlands i imagine there must
be a lot of snow you can set me right on this if
you please

  is there a transcontinental road from chile to
the argentine would there be much red tape in
getting a transient automobile in and out of the
countries between the u s and mexico you
simply drive across mexican or american license
is sufficient

  the roads proposition is what worries me and
i certainly would appreciate it if you would help us
decide whether the expense involved could be offset
by the trips we would be able to make naturally
we want to cover all points of interest and expecially
mining camps and it would be ridiculous to go to the
expense of taking a machine and having to pay rent
for storage somewhere and take to horses to get to
our destination

  thank you in advance for your courtssy in this
connection-jno v boyce houston texas

  reply by mr young-thanks for the compli-
ment i do seem to recognize the brotherhood exist-
ing between you and me we have quaffed of the
dreamers wine hit the pipe that makes romantic
thoughts bubble in the brain taken a shot in the
arm from the same needle that makes us see the
joke of existence land of the lotus land of
the burning sun land of lazy-eyed senoritas
cheap booze easy jobs non-energetic people to
stalk big among if it wasnt for the malaria the
pesky mosquitoes the dysentery the fleas and lice-
but why spoil the picture

  roads in colombia you ask me non-existent
no can do with an auto a hard trail is best man
the mud and grades are terrific when the trail is
any wider than a path and steep all same house
roof there is hardly enough level road in the whole
republic to burn a gallon of gas on

  in chili there are a couple of roads much dust-
half a foot deep-on the southern one the trans-
andean is very rough one fellow the buick agent
in buenos aires made it across after much hardship
they had to blast down rocks rebuild bridges and
sling the car down with ropes in places i imagine
it cost him considerable to make the trip but he was
of course repaid in the consequent advertising

  argentine has plenty of level going and that is
about the only country a man can get around a bit
with a car some of the other countries have them
but only for use in the large cities this is the case
with brazil

  it can be done from texas to mexico city pos-
sibly from there down to cordoba a thousand to
one shot of being able to fetch guatemala city and
thence to salvador it cant be done any farther
honduras has one good road but there is nothing
connecting with it from the north nicaragua
costa rica panama colombia ecuador all the
others in fact from there south to argentine are
absolutely impossible with a car

  winter down there in south america is on the
other side of the year they have some rather
cold augusts in southern chili the best way and
almost the only one is to arrive by steamer ride the
native railroads and travel by mule or on foot then
take another steamer you need have no fear of
having them kick when you drive over the border in
lost trails



the auto man there is no actual record of any
white man having walked across from panama into
colombia a few have made it on a hard trail from
colombia to ecuador two t t ts made it on
foot from ecuador to peru and what they saw almost
set up a war-peruvian rubber slavery inquiry was
started by them there is a hundred thousand
square miles of unknown country on the upper bra-
zilian border most of it covered with water for long
periods during the year no sir sorry but its
hopeless

      leper island
      good place to avoid

  request-where can i obtain information of the
government leprosy island

where does a person apply for a position as

guard

what is the term of enlistment also the salary
are guards held until examined for leprosy after
enlistment expires

what are the requirements or regulations to fill

 the position

i	have a friend who was a water-tender in the
navy during the war has an honorable discharge
and believes he wants the position would thank
you for any information-geo m fisher butte
mont

reply by mr halton-there are no guards em-
ployed at molokai leper island and you are one
of the many ex-service men who have been hoaxed
regarding the good jobs to be had there sorry
