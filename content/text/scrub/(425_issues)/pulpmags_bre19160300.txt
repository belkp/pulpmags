greater love than this

by louise winter

in april breezy stories

reater love has no man than this that he lay
down his life for his friend but what is the great-
est proof of love that a woman can offer

  this is the question that confronts sybil she has
clung fast to the traditions of her youth she has pinned
her faith to the honesty of the man she has married and
she has resolutely closed her eyes to his shortcomings
separation only deepens her tender feelings toward him
and then she is suddenly confronted with the opportunity
to prove the depth of her love is disillusion only the
natural outcome of marriage is it only absence that has
dulled loves bright image will the spark be lit again
when they are once more face to face or have they
grown apart each finding a new interest which could
easily develop into mature affection

  the question is brought home to sybil in which way
can she show the greater love for dan by holding him
fast or by giving him up

this struggle is one that confronts many women and
sybil ends it in the only way that appears right to her
the love-story of a human cog

by martin kcuar
i

there is so little ornamental
about me that pretty girls un-
less i step on their feet dont
ever trouble to look me over
as a mixer i was always a failure i
tear that in the direction of sociability
there is something radically wrong with
me and ive often wished that i pos-
sessed more spirit but until the day
before yesterday when i met miss
muriel ward the wish never disturbed
my peace of mind

  somehow i find myself urged to write
about that meeting  suppose my idea
is to draw a picture of myself as i appear
to others out of my proper element try
as i may to avoid caricature  have a feel-
ing that it is going to be a comic picture

  this is the way the annoyance began
it knocked on my door early in the eve-
ning two days ago and baldwin entered
baldwin is another cog of about my size
in the same wheel we work in the same
department our salaries as long as we
measure up to a certain standard of effi-
ciency is an even hundred dollars a
month but if a slight defect should be
discovered in us any two of a thousand
other small cogs temporarily held in re-
serve will automatically replace us and
will fit in the wheel as well as we did at
our best of course i realized that long
ago but it never troubled me to any ex-
tent i dont believe in brooding over
the future besides until day before
yesterday ive managed to steer clear of
spending money except for books and
necessities and ive a comfortable little
sum laid by for a rainy day

  you read a great deal said baldwin
after he had helped himself to one of my
cigars mwhat do you get out of it 

  i pass the time i replied

  thanks he said timell pass
somehow the question is do you get
any fun

  it gives me pleasure t returned

and as i only read good books it helps
to improve my mind

  thats a lot of bunk was his laconic
assertion ive worked alongside of you
for four years straight but you may call
me bismarck if i am able to notice any
improvement what do you do when you
dont read why dont you wake up
what he said sounded like an echo
from my conscience just before he en-
tered i had been reflecting that undoubt-
edly i was spending too much time in
my comfortable armchair reading books
i seemed to be out of touch with every-
thing except my work in the office al-
though i was positive that i possessed the
qualities essential for genuine friendship
i knew of no man whom i could call my
friend it would be my twenty-eighth
birthday the next day and i might shake
myself by the hand and offer congratula-
tions nobody else would that was cer-
tain

  say oliver baldwin went on hon-
est i like you and i believe id do you
a real favor if i took you in hand and
helped you to getting shaked up a bit
come put the weight on your feet lets
take a walk

  i knew his idea of taking a walk up
and down four blocks and then a halt in
a saloon for some beer up and down
four blocks once more and then another
halt for some more beer what pleasure
anybody can find in drinking a lot of beer
one doesnt need and doesnt care for
passes my understanding beer is an
abominable mixture it seems to me

   go with you i agreed but im
not going to have any beer

  no fear said baldwin nix on the
beer stuff to-night dont forget vour
hat

  oliver he said in a confidential un-
dertone after we had reached the street

breezy stories

you and i are going to the icarus with
a couple of lady friends of mine

  i halted ready to turn back that i
am anything but a ladies man seems to
have been generally recognized by every-
body who knows me baldwins proposi-
tion made me feel uneasy the idea of
me going to a cabaret show with two
girls i did not know

  what sort of two ladies i asked
  oh decent girls dont you worry
  what about their parents

  great scott f  said baldwin re-
garding me pityingly we dont want
their parents along their parents live
elsewhere i believe  the girls dont de-
pend on them for anything they are
telephone girls theyll be off at eight
we are to wait for them outside the
icarus

  we i exclaimed dont you think
you take a great deal for granted  how
do you know ill be there

  well they know somebody will be
there i promised to bring a friend
dont back out now old man between
the two of us it wont cost so very much
but itll be pretty expensive for one

  i should think it would cant you
get somebody else

  to tell you the truth- he replied
with his usual candor i tried to get
everybody else you were the last in
the line and i thought the experience
would do you good theres a good fel-
lawhe grasped me by the elbow and
led me along in spite of my protests
let me tell you right now he con-
tinued as if he already took my consent
for granted so we wont have to quar-
rel about it afterward the little one
is my girl you stick to the big one

  his words seemed to carry the infer-
ence that the girl i was to stick to
being tall was quite capable of taking
care of me so long as i footed the bill

  hoped she wouldnt be conspicuously
tall and much to my relief she wasnt
on her french heels she merely loomed
above me by an inch and a half i am a
trifle below medium height in almost
any conference i feel most at ease when
other fellow sits dovn and i stand
up and though i admire them very

much i always feel uncomfortable in
the company of tall women

  my first impressions of miss muriel
were a little confused her large brown
eyes sparkled with a sort of devilish mis-
chief that got on my nerves and she had
a way of tilting her head and looking
down on me that made me feel smaller
as compared to her than really was the
case  judged that she had left the pub-
lic school eight or ten years ago and i
was soon impressed that she had con-
siderable more experience in the greater
training school than i she was well and
nearly dressed and struck me as being
the kind of girl who could make a lit-
tle go a long way and she was dis-
concertingly pretty

  baldwin called the other girl gertie
-her surname i failed to catch at the
introduction she seemed of a pleas-
ant disposition but i didnt like her
laugh nor did i like miss muriels
laugh i had a feeling all the time that
besides the trirles that so amused them
they saw something extremely jolly in
the situation which i failed to see and
i was a little put out on that account

  it developed that the girls hadnt had
their dinner that in fact as a matter
of course they were looking to us to
buy their dinner i had come prepared
to spend a dollar loafing over a glass
of beer but i soon realized that it wasnt
going to be that way miss muriel looked
up from the wine card and said to the
waiter whom she seemed to know

  ill start with a martini cocktail

  port wine for mine said gertie who
also seemed to know the waiter

  from the way miss muriel studied
the menu i knew that she was deter-
mined to get my moneys worth she
examined the list of food as a discrimi-
nating person would examine a list of
books such a person ive noticed will
run his finger down the list of authors-
on the right-hand side-and when his
eye alights on the name of some literary
genius then he will look at the titles at
the left-hand side miss muriel had
a similar method of choosing her dinner
there were all kinds of prices from ten
cents up to two dollars but her finger
did not hesitate a fraction of a second
the lofe-story of a human cog



on any of the small figures it stopped
at the two-dollar figure then it made a
swift rectangular motion to the left and
instantly she knew what she was going
to have for dinner

  aint you going to have anything
she asked me after she had ordered
about three dollars worth of food

   i told her i had had my dinner

  have a sandwich anyway she in-
vited smiling generously for com-
panys sake

  sure take a sandwich said bald-
win who had ordered some kind of gou-
lash

  so t asked the waiter to bring me a
cheese sandwich and a pot of tea at
that they all lost control of themselves
i failed to see the humor in the situa-
tion and told them so- couldnt a man
order a cheese sandwich and a pot of
tea without being laughed at 

  pardon me said miss muriel after
she had recovered part of her breath
but you looked so funny ordering that
cheese sandwich and that-pot-of-
tea

  now i am mentally neither deaf nor
dumb i am as intelligent as the aver-
age person and i do believe i am slight-
ly more so than baldwin i knew what
made them laugh when a man is out
of his element he doesnt appear to his
advantage he may even act as a fool i
suppose i had behaved like some sort of
clown without intending it

  miss muriel was kind enough to
change the subject she told me she had
gone without lunch in anticipation of
this princely spread and t could well be-
lieve her for she seemed to be rein-
forcing herself against a lunchless to-
morrow i didnt mind that so much
hut i did object to the frequent cock-
tails ry looking at the wine list i found
that they cost forty cents apiece and
within an hour and a half she did away
with three of them it seemed to me
a reckless way of spending the money
of a man she had not known for two
hours it certainly wasnt polite

   i tried to make her see it

  they might go to your head i
warned her

   i like them she replied looking at

me mockingly why dont you try one
-theyre good

  i am glad you like them i lied but
think of to-morrow

  bother said she they dont hurt
me maybe you dont like this place so
very well

  oh i guess its all right i replied
evasively

  sure its all right or you wouldnt
find me here - i come here quite often
with a good friend of mine but he
backed out to-night i guess he had an
appointment with another girl

  she was quiet for a space gazing away
wistfully toward a gay crowd of ap-
parently wayward young people of the
upper class then she expressed a wish
for another of the same

  if you think it is right i said hesi-
tatingly

  its all right as long as you dont mix
them she instructed me dont ever
worry about me w ipe your chin and
pull down your vest-youre in a worse
state than i am she pushed the bell
for the waiter then leaned toward me
confidentially did you ever hear of
the poor babes that got themselves lost
in the woods she asked

  i didnt i answered

  well its a sad sad story ill tell
it to you some time

  i tried to think of some repartee but
as nothing appropriate occurred to me
i thought better of it and changed the
subject

  do your parents live in this city miss
ward i asked

  no she replied sobering a little i
left them home

  where is your home may i ask
where i hang my hat she answered
indifferently

  that was hardly witty i thought but
evidently she wished to avoid serious
conversation if there is anything i am
an absolute failure at it is in this jolly-
ing small talk that seems lo cost most
people no effort at all baldwin is an
expert at it between him and the
girls they kept it up all the evening
they must have uttered enough non-
sense to fill a good-sized hook

  we stayed in the icarus until about


breezy stories

closing time when it came to settling
it gave me quite a shock to learn that
the bill had crept up to fifteen dollars
and sixty cents baldwin asked me in

an undertone to pay the entire amount
-he would settle with me later it
looked piker-like he argued to split
it between us in the restaurant but i
know baldwin and i made him pay his
share right there

  outside the icarus we were assaulted
by a score or so of parasite taxidrivers
every one of whom seemed to be as sure
as he was of breakfast that we were
going for a midnight joyride and were
only undecided as to which taxi to em-
ploy miss muriel placed a meditative
finger on her underlip and looked them
over then she looked at me and smiled
bewitchingly

  wouldnt it be nicer she said

  right here ladies right here gentle-
men cried the most energetic of the
cabmen and took hold of me i tried to
shake him off but he wouldnt let go
he was looking respectfully at miss mu-
riel as though she were the mistress of
the whole show

  but just then fate stepped in or per-
haps it wasnt so much fate after all
i think that nellis knowing where to
find her must have been waiting out-
side for miss muriel nellis is a slight-
ly bigger and more important cog than
i am we have known each other for
several years but beyond an occasional
hello in the office where i see him
every day we are as good as strangers
to one another we dont mix he is
more like baldwin and he is a hand-
some fellow tall and graceful and more
distinguished looking than most cogs

  the moment miss muriel saw him she
forgot all about the taxi the coaxing
look went out of her brown eyes and
into them came a new expression which
somehow i wished had been for me she
tried to look angry but she didnt suc-
ceed

  youre a nice one she said to nel-
lis

  i know it nellis laughed hello
  oliver old top he hailed me

  had a good time

  miss muriel gave me no time to an-

swer in fact as far as she was con-
cerned i had ceased to exist she tugged
at his sleeve

  why couldnt you comer

  i told you i had an important en-
gagement said nellis carelessly

  you didnt want to by this time
she had her hand on his arm in a way
that showed plainly that she claimed him
for her escort and actually they were
beginning to walk away

  baldwin who was a little ahead with
gertie turned and beheld me standing
alone i am still wondering what i
looked like

  arent you coming oliver y he
asked

  i was going to blurt not as a fifth
wheel but the grins and stares of the
twenty taxidrivers checked me so i
simply said

   no not to-night

  hearing my voice miss muriel seemed
to recall me she turned

  oh arent you she cried affecting
great disappointment well thank you 
for to-night mr oliver by-by

  nellis came over to my desk the fol-
lowing afternoon he addressed me with
unusual cordiality

  that was a mean rotten treatment
muriel gave you last night but dont
blame me oliver you saw the way
she hung on to me and i couldnt very
well shake her off

  thats all right i said i am sorry
i butted in i had no idea that you and
she kept company

  oh-as for that he leaned leisure-
ly against my desk regardless of the
chief clerk yho was just passing nel-
lis can do a good man things with im-
punity that we other ordinary cogs
dare not dream cf doing muriel is
nothing to me he said

  she is a bit of a luxury isnt she

i ventured

  not when she is with me he as-
serted i got her out of the habit how
do you like her

  i think i should like her better if
she would be less expensive

  youve got her number and she is
stingy too
the love-story of a human cog	

   stingy 

    sure she is stingy

   im afraid i dont quite understand
youre thick as mud oliver he in-
formed me pleasantly i mean of
course that she wants everything she can
get out of you short of actual cash but
she wont give you anything in return
you mean she is decent 

  i mean she is wise said nellis
wise is the word oliver wanting
everything and giving nothing in return
isnt what i call decent shes too wise
for me to waste my time on you can
have the kid if you want her-im
through with her

  i	saw baldwin later he grinned
shamefacedly

  i suppose you are through with mu-
riel after what she did to you last night
he observed

  oh i dont know about that i an-
swered til admit that she made me
fed a bit foolish but that may be a way
she has

  i dont get your meaning said bald-
win but take my advice and hang on
to your little roll she is jolly good com-
pany but in the long run she is a pretty
poor investment

ii

  it is more than a week since some
fool impulse made me write down my
little excursion in a world where i evi-
dently did not belong i still agree with
baldwin that muriel is a poor invest-
ment though in the meantime some-
thing lias happened which has made me
think more kindly of her

  i dont often take my meals at alex-
anders restaurant the place is too far
away from my lodgings for daily pa-
tronage but on pleasant sunday morn-
ings t am in the habit of walking over
there the restaurant is spacious and
cheerful and i like to spend an hour or
so in it readine my paper over a sec-
ond cup of coffee they have an ex-
cellent cook their flapjacks are uncom-
monly good and yon get real maple
syrup with them all for fifteen cents
now it so happens that muriel and ger-

tie live within a block of alexanders
and they too have a weakness for the

flapjacks but of course until i unex-
pectedly faced them upon entering the
restaurant last sunday morning  had
no idea that they would be there

  well what could a man do they
caught sight of me before i saw them
or  should have turned and fled mu-
riel flashed a smile at me and indicated
the empty chair at her side now il
i had possessed a modicum of gump-
tion i should have ignored the invita-
tion-she deserved it-hut evidently she
knew it wasnt in me to decline

  however i tried to act as though tak-
ing breakfast with two attractive girls
was an experience in which i could see
no particular charm though i have mis-
givings that the tone of easy familiarity
i assumed impressed them as genuine
perhaps i overdid it it was one of my
few pleasures i told them to read my
sunday paper over a second cup of cof-
fee in this cheerful place now i sup-
posed i was expected to talk to them

  oh no not necessary said gertie

  go on read your old paper said mu-
riel

  well watch you do it said gertie

  itll be such fun said muriel

  i ruminated on that for a while then
i put the paper aside and remarked it
was a beautiful morning

  they had noticed it the sun had
chased them out of bed

  by bright daylight i had a better look
at muriel one thing i like about her
-she doesnt use powder or if she does
she certainly knows how to put it on i
believe she would have a fine complexion
if she spent a month or two in the moun-
tains and slept in a tent and i believe
also that her eyes would lose some of
their deviltry with the improvement of
her complexion i call it deviltry but
ive fouhd it isnt always so

  isnt it too bad she said we
have to work this afternoon wouldnt
it be nice to spend the day in the park
loafing under the trees

  when do you start to work  i asked

  at one sharp there should be a
law preventing people from using the
phone on sundays
s	breezy

  i looked at my watch it is only nine
oclock you have all forenoon why
dont you make use of it

  hardly worth spending carfare for

the sake of it said gertie

  it is foreign to my nature to thrust
my company on anybody and i dont
know what made me do it in this case

  ill take you out i offered

  muriel looked from me to gertie i
believe she winked an eye

  that would be real nice said ger-
tie

  of course if youll let me i added

  well let you said muriel there
was a calculating look in her eyes and
suddenly they flashed with the light of
a bright idea

  let us go in a taxi she cried

  i sipped my coffee slowly while gath-
ering courage to meet this insidious flank
attack on my pocket-book then meet-
ing her glance i smiled-or tried to
smile

  nothing doing i said

  piker flashed her brown eyes but
her lips said ingratiatingly  why not

  because miss ward going out in a
taxi as far as i am concerned would
be putting on airs i cant afford to
acquire any costly habits you know that
as well as i do what is the use of pre-
tending to be something that you really
arent-nobody will like you for it

  a good fellow would do it if i asked
him said muriel plainly unable to see
my argument but since you look at it
that way i guess a jitneyll do

  she looked so genuinely disappointed
that i almost gave in but i realized
i would feel sorry for it afterward so
asking them if they were ready i rose
and picked up my check the girls also
got to their feet and the waitress be-
ginning to clear the table handed their
checks to me paying for their break-
fast was something that had not oc-
curred to me when i accepted muriels
invitation to sit down at their table but
as the girls acted as though there was
no cash register in the place it seemed
that to pay for all of us was the proper
thing for me to do and i did it

  often before when spending a sun-
day in the park all by my lonesome my

stories

 heart had ached when i watched the so-
 ciable crowds all about me toward sun-
 set was the time i began to envy them

 in the early afternoon the book  in-
 variably had brought with me usually
 - held my attention and i was hardly ever
 moved by anything going on about me
 except the shifting shade of the tree i
 was leaning against when it left me ex-
 posed to the full glare of the sun but
 toward evening as i said when the dull
 print began to weary i would sense in
 the laughter and the light and buoyant
 footsteps an accusation that seemed to
 emanate from smiling nature herself
 and  would read upon the faces that
 seemed the happiest that although i had
 passed a tranquil and pleasant afternoon

 i had as usual missed the wine

   and i would curse myself for being
 a bookworm and timid and wish i were
 out there on the graveled path among
 the others who experienced the stuff that
 furnished material for books and read
 books when they had nothing better 
 to do

   well this morning i had my wish i
 looked about me in the hope of discover-
 ing some solitary pedestrian of my own
 species who might envy me but it seemed
 that muriel gertie and t had the park
 all to ourselves there have been oc-
 casions on rainy days or early in the
 morning when i have enjoyed a lonely
 stroll in this park and more than once
 during my silent wanderings did i have
 a sweet vision of some one stepping light-
 ly at my side some one sympathetic and
 understanding her hand in mine beneath
 the bowers of a long sequestered path
 and both of us wishing for no other com-
 panion

   muriel could never be such a com-
 panion  gertie far far less gertie fair-
 ly overflowed with nonsense she want-
 ed to know why there were so few peo-
 ple about she wondered every ten min-
 utes what time it could be she hoped the
 strenuous exercise of walking so fast
 wouldnt affect her health and finally
 she wanted to sit down

   stick on your stilts said muriel
 walk while you have a chance tt isnt
 every day you get a gentleman to take
 you out for a walk
the love-story

   it isnt every fellow  let take me
 genie came back

    hope youre enjoying yourself
 said muriel after we had walked about
 a mile and a half

   i am i replied heartily i do en-
  joy walking if you girls are enjoying
 yourself as thoroughly as i am  am per-
 fectly content

   i think that was very handsomely said
 and i believe muriel thought so too
 she looked at me a little curiously

   til bet i can beat you walking  she
 said well try a walking race some
 day when gertie isnt along eh how-
 ever as the staid old cat remarked tread-
 ing its way gingerly along a spiked fence
 let us take our time heres a bench
 and here we sit down

   ill say this much she admitted
 after we were seated there is more
 fun to this little hike of ours than i
 thought there would be it beats by a
 mile sitting in the room yawning over
 the funny papers that little two by
 four is getting my goat for sure

   but you dont stay home much do
 you i asked

   xot so much now said muriel
 but every half hour i spend in it out-
 side dressing and sleeping hours gives me
 the blues what is a girl to do on
 eight dollars a week i like to ask you
 -rent a furnished apartment every-
 thing goes to buy rags and shoes and
 gloves and things if you havent got
 good clothes to wear you may as well be
 in jail-nobody will take you any place
 i i guess i know how it feels to be
 in jail

   i had some inane stuff on my lips to
 the effect that a pretty girl like she
 could have all the companions she want-
 ed but happily i thought better of it in
 time

   i came to this city about two years
 ago she went on i sat by thewin-
 dow in the y y c a the first sunday
 i was here watching the people go out
 to the park-thousands of them-and i
 wondered where they all were going a
 kind old maid invited me to go out with
 her-none but a lonely kind old maid
 would for i didnt have anything fit
 to wear wasnt i lucky though to get

of a human cog	

 a job but will you believe me for
 four months straight  stuck to my little
 clothes closet every sunday because i
 didnt have anything to wear i had to
 send some money back to the folks you
 know and the glad rags had to wait
 but say it was tough talking about
 being in jail

  she sat silent for a while gazing up
in the crown of a fine beech

  and it was summer she then sighed
i had a feeling all the time of being
cheated youre young buf once and
time does fly so there i would keep
to my room hot as a bake-oven at times
all day long reading stories about the
upper half always swells or near-swells
painted in colors so contrasting to the
dishwater color of my own existence that
in the end it gave me the blues worse
than ever and i would have a good
cry tough oh no

  her voice vibrated when she looked
at me again all the mockery had gone
out of her eyes they were hard now
and regarded me resentfully as though
i was partly to blame for the barrenness
of the summer she had lost

  you could have married that well-to-
do venerable gink that was stuck on you
in them days gertie reminded her

  him she waved the suggestion
away as if it were too loathsome to
consider he was old enough to be
my grandfather and i knew he hit the
bottle regular i dont believe in shaking
hands with the devil before you meet
him

  but didnt you go to church and try
to get acquainted with some nice peo-
ple i asked it was just like me to
suggest something i had never tried my-
self

  i told you i had nothing to wear
she flashed at me as though impatient
with my stupidity

  the answer seemed final she had
had nothing to wear and that settled it
but just what she meant by having
nothing to wear continued to puzzle
me

  it was getting toward noon on mu-
riels suggestion we steered for a jitney
within sight i argued that there was
no need to hurry-the jitney would take


breezy stories

us downtown in ten minutes but mu-
riel insisted and she is a headstrong per-
son after we had left the car i discov-
ered why she had been so set upon re-
turning to the city a whole hour before
her duties called her to the telephone ex-
change she had the jitney stop outside
alexanders restaurant and after we had
alighted she said  well come on hoys
and girls its time for lunch but she
never meant that the treat should be
on her 

  muriel disappeared up the steps of
the telephone building an hour later but
she remained in my thoughts long after
i had planned the day before to spend
the sunday in the usual quiet way and
had provided myself with a copy of a
pocket edition of the light that
failed but kipling proved a lifeless
companion that afternoon i told my-
self that i was a fool to think of the
girl if she was too wise for nellis she
certainly would prove so in my case
as long as she suggested no other treats
than jitney rides and inexpensive walks
in the park there was no danger of her
bringing about my ruin but i certainly
drew the line at dinners at the icarus
and joyrides besides it is plain as day-
light that she is in love with nellis and
merely regards me as a sort of queer
mutt who cant possibly arouse the jeal-
ousy of any one and will come in handy
once in a while to foot the bill when
there is nobody else around to do it

  she had given me her telephone num-
ber and asked me to call her up and i
had given her mine and i had taken
her up on that walking race proposi-
tion

  we havent had it yet when she
called me up the other evening and asked
me what in the world i was doing any-
way i reminded her of our agreement
but she replied she had been joshing
of course a walking race the very
idea what would her mother think of
it- good-night she was very much
afraid i wanted to take her at a sixty-
mile clip along the smooth oily road
that led straight to perdition my pacc
was far too fast for her now if i had
suggested a little dinner party at that

delightful cabaret place i would have
suggested something within reason and
if i could talk mr baldwin over into
taking gertie the girls would have any
evening oil after eight i thought i had
her cornered right there

  and have nellis wait outside for you
to see you home

there was a brief pause then-
nellis wouldnt bother she paused
again then went on briskly hes a
cross between a fresh guy and a bad
egg i shant ever speak to him again
did-did he insult you

  insult me oh my no im just a
working girl you know nellis misun-
derstood me and i misunderstood him
-thats all

  well she demanded in the ensuing
pause while i was thinking of something
to say

  i dont like that icarus cabaret i
objected let us go to some other
place how about alexanders 

  after eight oclock theyll have noth-
ing to sell but pork and beans and my
doctor told me not to eat that stuff and
theyve no music cant you see my side
of it

  cant you see my side of it i asked
her in return

  sure i can you love your little pile
more than you do me but dont forget
laddie that the money you own to-mor-
row wont buy you the fun you could
have had yesterday

  thats a piece of sophistry i re-
marked

  its a piece of what

  it doesnt matter you cant talk
me over to take you to that place- it
wouldnt be right

  tell him he is a piker i heard a
voice-undoubtedly gerties-propose at
her end of the wire but muriel evi-
dent- was too much of a lady to follow
the council

  good-by she wound up the conver-
sation abruptly so sorry to have dis-
turbed you 

  disturbed me i should say she had
disturbed me just before she called me
up t had been abroad with washington
irving on his journey through fascinat-
ing spain but now try as i might i
the love-story of a human cog



found it impossible to rejoin him in the
spirit

  so i was almost glad to see baldwin
when he dropped in a half hour later

  heard from muriel lately he asked
with a grin gertie was after me only
half an hour ago in regard to blowing
them to another dinner at the icarus
 well blow them i said i sup-
pose it is all right with you

  rats he replied laughing cynically
what is there in it they always stick
together-its money thrown away for
next to nothing if they had their way
you could spencj your whole salary on
them and if you lost your job and found
yourself broke theyd cut you dead
they strike you as capable of almost
anything at first but after a while youll
find out that theyve set themselves a
certain limit its a game theyre play-
ing and in a way you cant blame them
much for trying to get your goat when
they know youre after theirs

  i am not trying to get anybodys
goat i replied a little hotly not in
the sense you mean

  eh  whats that oliver-you
arent  well you can almost make me
believe it but you can be pretty sure
that muriel sizes you up as being like
the rest of the bunch ive noticed how
she studies you youre a case of still
water

  even if a fellow was really in love
with any of them he went on after a
reflective pause i dont believe they
would get wise to begin with i was
stuck on gertie in what you might call
the right way but it wore off after i had
been out with her twice-cost me a
weeks pay now i am stuck on her in
what i suppose you call the wrong way
perhaps she didnt size you up right
in the beginning i said

  that may be that may be its just
as nellis says-theyre too wise
nellis used to go out with muriel a
good deal i said

  baldwin laughed again yes and
muriel thought he was intending to
marry her poor girl

  by poor girl  she is just as good
as nellis any time

  better i should say when it comes

to morals nellis is already married
he lives apart from his wife

  the information gave me quite a

shock

  does muriel know  i asked

  no i am quite sure she doesnt with
all her faults shed cut him dead the
minute she found out they are not on
speaking terms just now but that is
merely because nellis was a bit too fresh
with her that night when he saw her
home

  you mean he insulted her

  oh well call it that

  it occurred to me that i had never
liked nellis and it seemed i hated him
now

  you should have told muriel

  who-me  what business is that of
mine id only get in dutch with nel-
lis he has quite a pull with the chief
you know i suppose i am the only one
of the boys that knows he is married
he made me promise not to tell muriel
whatever you do dont let on i told
you

  you neednt worry i assured him
thoroughly disgusted with his smallness
i shant tell muriel unless nellis in-
sults her again she will feel better for
not knowing it perhaps

  careful old man baldwin warned
me winking an eye youll get hurt if
your interest in muriel lasts more than
a month

ill

  that conversation took place about
six weeks ago and in the interim a great
number of small occurrences with mu-
riel as the central figure cumulative in
regard to the complete ruin of my peace
of mind have made me come to the con-
clusion that i was a fool in not avoid-
ing them i wish i had never met mu-
riel i wish i had never heard of her
and even while i try to banish her from
my thoughts i yearn for her and sit with
my nerves on edge waiting for her sum-
mons over the telephone

  did anybody ever hear of a snowman
playing with fire

  she would have passed out of my life
-

breezy stories

long ago if her conduct throughout our
acquaintance had borne out my first un-
favorable impression of her and  should
have remembered her merely with a feel-
ing of regret that a perverted idea of
what constitutes amusement should
cause such a good-looking gir to travel
at a pace that inevitably must lead to
the bitterest of all disappointments but
that is just the trouble there are two
sides to muriel the side predominant
is that developed by the hollow sophisms
of bad companions and the veiled innu-
endoes of bad books strengthened 
doubt in the dreary summer months dur-
ing which she had nothing to wear
what went before i dont know- have
never asked her but often i think that
if fate had led us together two or three
years ago i should have known her
other side-her good side-as the
stronger

  it shines through once in a while i
catch a glimpse of it and then it is gone
but while it lasts i feel there is a bond
of sympathy between us and with each
such glimpse the bond strengthens its
hold upon me and in vain my reason
struggles to regain its liberty

  when i am capable of rational reason-
ing i know that this state of things
cant last long i see her quite frequent-
ly now baldwin and gertie are as a
rule along and the object of our meet-
ings is always a good time in some
form or other but i am out of tune
with their excessive vivacity and often i
find muriel looking at me with a specu-
lative frown as if wondering where my
thoughts are or if i have any at all

  as for taxi rides we have had quite
a few and we have dined a few times
at the icarus we would have dined
there every evening if muriel had had
her way since i met her t havent
saved a dollar and i used to add fifty at
least to my bank account every month
being with muriel means spending
money at a rale that often takes my
breath away

  as for instance we arrange over the
telephone to go to a movie except put-
ting into practice that long-deferred
walking race in the park there is noth-
ing i like better than to take muriel to

 a good photo play any rationally con-
 structed scene appealing to the gentler
 emotions never fails in its desired ef-
 fects upon muriel-her tears are not so
 very far away and she knows good hu-

 	mor from bad while looking at the
 pictures i have at least the satisfac-
 tion that we are feeling together and
 the price of admittance as compared to
 that pleasure is inconsiderable indeed
 but as baldwin says it you think
 shell let you off with twenty cents
 youve got another think coming-she
 will close the conversation over the tele-
 phone with something like this you
 and baldwin come over and have a lit-
 tle chat before we go to the show and
 say bring a box of chocolates then
 she tells me what kind to buy

    after the show it is taken for granted
 that we visit an ice-cream parlor then
 we may take an inexpensive stroll up and
 down the street for a half hour or so
 but all the time muriel seems to be on
 the lookout for some small souvenir of
 a character conformable with her pe-
 culiar notions of propriety to ask her
 escort to buy for her a block from their
 hotel she will usually stop at a fruit-
 stand and point out certain delicacies
 which she should dearly love to have
 on one occasion we passed a shooting
 gallery and there was no stopping her
 with a perseverance that i should have
 admired if each crack of the toy-rifle
 hadnt stung me to the quick with the
 realization of another nickel gone for-
 ever she shot away a dollar and a half
 and i believe she would have been quite
 capable of making it ten if i hadnt asked
 her to give somebody else a chance to
 spend his money then she actually had
 the nerve to call me a piker

   muriel t said i would sooner
 give you three dollars for something use-
 ful than have you spend a like amount
 of your own money in a shooting gal- 
 jery

   ill take you up on that said mu-
 riel without an instants hesitation ive
 got just three dollars in my pocket-
 book- and she started for the shoot-
 ing gallery again

   very curious to know what she would
 do next i handed her the three dollars
the love-story of a hi man cog	

  muriel look the coins turned each of
them over once

  dear little three dollars she said
as she passed the money back i felt a
light pressure of her fingers

   i take it all back laddie dear she
laughed you are not such a piker
after all

  and for the remainder of that even-
ing she was the sort of sweet companion
i had so often dreamed about

  if her gentle moods would only last

  the books lie neglected for muriel
is always always in my thoughts but
she doesnt care for me she lias a cer-
tain ideal and the ideal looks very like
nellis the day she meets that ideal
and he thinks her worth the devotion of
his leisure hours it is all up with me
and doubtless though my whole being
quivers at the thought it would be the
best thing that could ever happen to me

i should be able to recover

  i gave her a photograph of myself two 
weeks ago a few days later baldwin
and i called at their room to take them 
to a show and naturally i looked for
the picture but it was nowhere in sight
most prominent among the numerous
photographs pennants and souvenir pos-
tal cards that adorn their little room was
as usual the handsome smiling image of
nellis enclosed in an expensive frame
of sterling silver which muriel other-
wise so parsimonious with her own
money had bought herself when his
name is mentioned she speaks of him as
of some negligible person whom she used
to know but why then in the name of
sound reason doesnt she remove the pic-
ture from the place of honor on her
dresser 

  i am at a loss to understand baldwin
his morals need mending badly some-
times he is cynically frank as to his mo-
tives in making love to gertie and at
other times he hints that he may marry
her some day and seems quite sincere
about it he has adopted an i told
you so attitude toward me it is his
unshakable opinion that muriel is get-
ting my goat-hoofs beard horns and
all lie wonders what will be my size
by the time muriel gets through with
me and often i wonder myself

  we saw nellis on the street the other
day accompanying a smartly dressed
young lady he looked the other way

  i suppose said muriel with a laugh
that sounded pitifully unnatural that
i wasnt classy enough for the real
role

   have taken a strong dislike to nel-
lis since i found out that lie is married
doubtless  am a poor hand at conceal-
ing my feelings for they seem to be
reciprocated although he endeavors to
act as though he is unaware of mv silent
antagonism he has assumed a friendly
and condescending tone when address-
ing me and often jollies me with ap-
parent good nature in regard to muriel

  how is my old girl  he asked me
yesterday as he passed me on his way
to the chiefs office

  his lips smiled but i read insolence
in his cold eyes

  you mean miss ward

  oh call her muriel-she likes that
better is she beginning to reform

  in what way i countered trying to
up to his pleasant manner
e laughed carelessly as he moved
away i suppose youll be asking for
a raise in salary soon was his parting
sally

  nellis is a brother-in-law or cousin or
something to one of the principal stock-
holders it is considered good policy in
our department to be on good terms with
him not so very long ago his salary
was no larger than mine but due to a
lucky combination of his pull and real
ability he was recently promoted to a
position worth a hundred and fifty i
was one of the dozen over whose heads
he was advanced but i never bore him
any ill will on that account although i
felt certain that i could fill the position
as well as he unlike most of the boys
in our department whose work is con-
fined to their papers on their desks nel-
lis duties include daily conferences with
the sales manager and credit man and
once a day at least he spends ten or
fifteen minutes in the chiefs office his
is the sort of position which if filled by
the right man affords splendid opportu-
nities for further promotion and inci-
dentally for knocking

iv

  now i suppose he will be knocking me
on a little reflection i know that there
is very little supposing about it-i
am face to face with the certainty of it

  it is funny how things will happen
but i dont care-i am glad it happened

  muriel and gertie had a whole sun-
day off and we had arranged to spend
the day at minerva beach weather per-
mitting

the weather graciously permitted

  minerva beach nestles coyly among
wood-covered slopes with a magnificent
background of snow-capped mountains
about three hours boat ride from the
city the resort is composed of a small
hotel in a state of neglect a dozen sum-
mer cottages and a grocer- store it is a
very beautiful spot but on account of
its distance from the city it has fewer
visitors than it deserves i had been
there once before but with no other com-
panion than a book

  we agreed that the girls should fur-
nish the spoons knives and such things
and baldwin and i the tickets and the
lunch not that muriel permitted us to
cram the lunch basket with anything we
saw fit what could we possibly know
about getting up a lunch basket first
she made a list of everything we were
to buy but on second thought she de-
cided that she had better superintend the
buying a variety of things that we
hadnt thought of or hadnt dared to
think of soon taxed the rather limited
capacity of our little wicker basket and
we were compelled to get a second one
to hold the fat corpse of a fowl which
the delicatessen man assured us was a
chicken and which muriel said was
absolutely indispensable

  never had i known such a perfect day
in tune the small steamboat pitched a
little in the swell of the open sea and
there was nothing whatever in the sky
or upon the shores or in our minds to
mar the day and after passing through
a bit of the most perfect scenery in the
universe we landed at minerva beach
  e parted from the other excursion-
ists and carried our lunch along the
beach until we came to an ideal spot

to our left was the sun-kissed sea en-
closed in a horizon of majestic moun-
tains to our right the land sloped gently
upward into primitive wilderness behind
us was a twenty-foot high wall of solid
granite decorated with a million or so
of barnacles our floor was granite too
smoothed by the tides of past ages
aborigines might have squatted on it for
all we knew feeding on raw fish with
nothing to go with it we covered it
with the latest sunday edition of a mod-
ern newspaper and muriel and gertie
set the table

  aint i the little champion lunch rus-
tler demanded muriel how would
you like to have me get up your lunch
regular 

  dont mention it said baldwin
wed eat only once a week if you had
your way do you know that this little
lunch cost us ten bucks

  no more than that cried muriel
i must have forgotten something but
dont let the price worry you boys- -
look at the time we are having

  muriel was quite right i philosophized
contentedly ten dollars indeed one
could well afford to spend a mite of the
provider against a rainy day to impress
indelibly in the memory that at least once
he treated himself to a corking good
time what a lot of pleasant times i had
missed i sat dose to muriel thrilled
by the warm touch of her hand in her
eyes i read that at the moment she was
the muriel  loved and i wished that
the day with its benevolent influence
upon her would last forever

  after an energetic but futile attempt
to empty the two lunch baskets we spent
a delightful hour basking in the sun-
light then gertie announced that she
was oing to take a nap andwhile bald-
win improvised a pillow from the sun-
day newspapers we had brought with
us muriel and i slipped away among
the barnacled boulders alone with her

i felt a little tongue-tied and her re-
marks were mainly confined to excla-
mations such as look at this and
look at that there were many in-
teresting things to look at sea-shells and
sea-stars and seaweeds and something
that had the appearance of a petrified
the love-story of a human cog	

sack of cement and we would stand
with heads close together while i en-
deavored to lecture on the objects we
examined though precious little did i
know about them

  then the reckless girl began moun-
tain-climbing feats among the boulders
and as her high-heeled boots were not
adapted for quick motion on the irregu-
lar ground i feared that she might stum-
ble and hurt herself presently in leap-
ing from one rock to another she slipped
on the seaweed but happily no other
damage resulted than a broken french
heel

  good-night was her cry of dismay
got any glue about you mr oliver

  i seated myself beside her and after
a prolonged examination of the broken
heel diagnosed that if she did no fur-
ther cavortings it might stay on until
we got back to the city

  another expense she sighed-i
thought with a hint tlsat the bill for the
repair of the boot ought to be included
in the general excursion expenses

  then she made a new discovery how
it happened was a mystery to her but
she had broken her brooch it wasnt
much of a brooch she admitted but
she valued it highly because it had been
given to her by a very good friend a
couple of years ago she sure did ap-
preciate little things like that when they
came from a good friend

  there you go again i scolded her
gently why dont you come out
straight and ask me to buy you a new
one 

  one doesnt ask for keepsakes she
enlightened me they wouldnt be
much of a keepsake if one did

  you as good as asked

  wen maybe but you do need coax-
ing

  id sooner buy you a new pair of
shoes i blurted recalling what i had
thought a hint in her tone at the mishap
to the french heel then i would be
doing you a real favor you need them
worse than you need the brooch

   felt relieved but somehow i was
not mvich surprised when she ccclined
my offer

  little muriel always could buy her

own boots she replied if anybody
told you different dont you believe
them

  i moved closer to her and gave her
hand a light pressure

  i like to think the best of you i
said and then i felt like an idiot for
talking like that

  she laughed how jolly v

  the situation may have seemed jolly
to her to me it was becoming some-
thing infinitely more than just jolly
i felt it in my blood as i looked into
her laughing eyes that i was sipping
from the wine i liad always been miss-
ing and i wanted to drink deeply mu-
riel looked her best to-day her cheeks
glowed healthily from the exercise in
the clean fresh air and her brown eyes
challenged and dared

  you look a hundred per cent better
to-day than when i first met you i
said warmly

  my gracious nurse aint you the
kidder f

  talking about jewelry i went on
completely carried away by the warm
look in her eyes there is a certain
piece of jewelry-not a brooch or any-
thing like that-that i should like to buy
you

  oh said muriel without the slight-
est embarrassment what a jolt or
do i misunderstand you what kiqd of
jewelry-does it look like a doughnut

  muriel cant you be serious

  she gave me a look of commiseration

  well

  it would mean everything to you and
me muriel if i bought it

 she looked away over the water
toward the small steamboat which was
just bringing another load of excursion-
ists

  i wouldnt buy it if i were you  she
said seriously im not the kind of girl
you want

  muriel

  forget it laddie youre a good boy
sometimes i think i am not treating you
right and i feel sorry i wish you could
do something to make me love you

  you like me now-dont you mu-
riel

  i do-youre dear to me just now
breezy stories

 

but it isnt always a sunny sunday in
june

  i know what you mean i said bit-
terly i am not fast enough for you

  fast she repeated with a curious
tremble you never had my number
right seriously i wouldnt want you to
be fast i like you best when youre
natural what is there in it nothing
in the long run-i know that as well as
you its a matter of luck what sort
of fellows you are thrown in with-and i
never seemed to have the right kind of
luck theres a certain type of man i
have my heart set on-i suppose you
know what i mean-and ive met the
type several times but he was always
dishonest never really meant to buy the
little piece of jewelry i wanted so much
sooner a necklace a bracelet a sunburst
-anything anything almost but show-
ing that he really cared you-youre
the first man that ever offered to do the
square thing by me and-and i thank
you for that

  i squeezed her hand and gave her the
use of my handkerchief as she had left
her own in her handbag the sunlight
seemed to have gone out of the land-
scape as i looked toward the pier where
the latest arriving excursionists were
just landing

  then that happened which seemed to
envelop the whole magnificent scenery
in sinister gloom there could be no
mistake about it-i knew only too well
the well-built graceful and smartly-
dressed figure on the narrow trestle
above the tidelands along which the ex-
cursionists were walking toward the
shore i beheld the man who i knew
at the moment was in muriels thoughts
nellis had been on that boat and it was
quite likely that we would meet him
before we left minerva beach

  from appearances he had no other
companion than a lean pipe-smoking per-
son in whose company  had often seen
him-a chartered accountant i believe
he is i did not make my discovery
known and i hoped that his arrival had
escaped gertie and baldwin whose
voices i heard a short distance away
there was a possibility that nellis would
follow the beach in the opposite direc-

tion from the course we had taken and
if we left on an earlier boat a meeting
with him might be avoided

  muriels tears did not last long her
eyes still shimmered as she returned the
handkerchief

  well talk about that some other
time she said dont forget we are
out to have a good time

  i could follow her train of reasoning
perfectly well she hadnt exactly hand-
ed me what she herself would term the
cold turkey-she had me still on the
string unobtrusive oliver so unlike
the type of dashing young man of pleas-
ing address and charming manners that
was her ideal would do as a last refuge
being so quiet and unassertive it stood
to reason that he would never cut much
of a figure in the world but other hopes
gone he would do quite well as a per-
manent meal-ticket and relieve her mind
forever of the haunting fey of becom-
ing a lonely old maid

  gertie and baldwin could have done
nicely all the afternoon without us join-
ing them they were holding hands un-
der the funny paper pretending to be
deeply interested in the latest doings of
the katzenjammer kids

  you may go and play some more
children baldwin granted providing
you behave

  let us all play some game muriel
proposed as she seated herself at one
side of the rock that had screened our
lunch party from intrusive eyes

  i went to the other side of the boul-
der and had a look at the portion of
the newly arrived picnickers that were
coming our way it was turning out as
i had feared-nellis and his friend
were steering straight for us and as
if to make the meeting with them un-
avoidable baldwin and gertie decided
that it was their turn to play and be-
gan climbing to the top of the large block
of granite

  hello baldwin suddenly exclaimed
look who is coming

  who asked muriel

  nobody said baldwin catching my
eve but it was too late muriels curi-
osity had been aroused

  i could see how the sight of nellis
the love-story

agitated her she stood motionless for
a moment as if undecided whether to
step behind the boulder or remain where
she could not help being observed by
him even as she appeared to make up
her mind to stay out of sightnellis saw
her

  why hello muriel he hailed wav-
ing his hat then he and his friend
came up to us hello gertie hello
everybody wheres your chaperon
girls he bantered the idea of you
going picnicking without asking me
along

  he introduced his friend i was so
put out by the intrusion that although
t caught the name i wouldnt have
known it a minute later

  come on sit down and have some
lunch gertie invited you dont know
what you have been missing

  no nellis returned his eyes on
muriel with a peculiar intensity that
suggested that until this moment he had
never really valued the girl as she ought
to be valued it appears that ive
missed something

  that his remark had no reference to
the lunch was clear to all of us bald-
win scowled behind his back muriel
evidently failed to appreciate his veiled
flattery and it pleased me to notice
seemed to resent it when he seated him-
self beside her if she had bestowed
upon me a similar look of strong dis-
approval it would have tied my awk-
ward tongue altogether but it failed to
freeze nellis from appearances he took
for granted that he had a perfect right
to monopolize her and i must say he
did it with good effect it wasnt long
before the ice was melted and that ac-
complished the scornful expression in
her eyes soon gave way to a look that
made my heart ache with bitterness for
just so had i wished that she should look
at me

  in a little while the conversation was
no longer general nellis lowered his
voice to a soft purr when he spoke to
muriel and presently she responded
either in the same confidential murmur
or with laughing monosyllablebald-
win and gertie began airurmg them-
selves with tossing pebbles at an empty

of a human cog	

bottle and nellis friend tried to get me
to discuss the european war the ca-
daverous chap whatever his name was
seemed to be an insufferable bore and
all the time while he was talking he
was helping himself to the very best of
the leavings of our expensive lunch

  as i thought the situation over while
pretending to be listening to a pro-ger-
man opinion of the russians it came to
me that nellis was playing on a presump-
tion that his pull in the office would
prevent any demonstration on my part
capable of arousing his displeasure
now he was wrong in that-i never
gave much thought to his superior po-
sition other than i would like to have it
myself

  nellis stood up and helped muriel to
her feet he might have let go of her
after she stood upright but he kept sup-
porting her as though he was giving her
a walking-lesson it may be chivalrous
to act that way toward a young and
healthy woman i dont know i only
know that it would have given me im-
mense relief if i had shouted at him
hands off i am glad now i didnt

  well just take a little stroll along
the beach said muriel with an apolo-
getic look at me

  dont worry about us old man nel-
lis added patronizingly if we should
miss the boat you go on well take the
next one home

  even now in a cooler moment i am
sure that i had every excuse for acting
as i did muriel loved this man she
wanted him to marry her it was my
duty as a friend and as a gentleman if
for no other reason to disillusion her
before it was too late

  whatever you do nellis i replied
succeeding i think in speaking calmly
dont be out too late-your wife may
be waiting for you

  he started it seemed to me that his
eyes turned green

  wife ejaculated muriel pushing
away the arm he had around her waist
wife she repeated with a catch in
her throat

  i tried to act as though i had noticed
neither his discomfiture nor her con-
sternation


breezy stories

  what are you giving us spoke nel-
lis with an uneasy laugh

  the straight goods i hope i an-
swered returning his hostile glare with
interest but endeavoring to seem sur-
prised at his question you have a
wife havent you

  muriel looked from him to me with
big staring eyes

  where the deuce did you get your
information he asked seemingly re-
covering from the first shock and doubt-
less relying on baldwins lacking the
nerve to bear me out i shant deny that
i began to feel uncomfortable i only
had baldwins word for nellis being a
married man and i had promised him
never to let out who told me but i
must say this for baldwin-at bottom he
is far from being a bad fellow he came
to my rescue like a gentleman

  if you want to know nellis said
baldwin drawling a little i gave him
the information and between you and
me and tom dick and harry dont
you think its about time muriel knows 
straight cried muriel turning with
flashing eyes to nellis

  well what about it he answered
with a grin that made me wonder where
his good looks had gone ive got a
perfect right to be married havent i
you snake muriel flashed i pity
your wife

  gently gently he laughed as he
stooped and picked up his hat nice
way to treat your guests dont you
think he motioned to the lunch-de-
vouring numskull let us leave this
crater before theres a general eruption
if we stay much longer he added with
a contemptuous look at me this poor

little insignificant simp-

  i have a flash of recollection of mu-
riel regarding me curiously as if won-
dering what i would do but i did not
stop to think of the look nor of any-
thing i went straight for nellis step-
ping i believe on his lunching friend
and i drove straight from the shoulder
at his classic chin and closed his face
before he could finish what he had on
his mind once more i felt the impact
as my fist connected with some part of
his head then something hitme and

down we went together and with a sense
of surprise  found myself on top but
the next moment hands pulled us apart
and then first i realized with a feeling
of mortification that i had lost my tem-
per and yiy dignity and was emerging
from the first scrap i had been in since
my last inglorious battle as a boy at
school

  inadvertently i rubbed the shin of my
left leg which was beginning to hurt

  he kicked cried muriel in a tone
of crushing contempt the big jelly-
fish-he kicked

  although my mind was in a state of
confusion i was quite capable of appre-
ciating the sting in muriels epithet it
must have wounded nellis terribly for
he is anything but a jellyfish if he had
been at all prepared for my attack he
would have toppled me over before i
had reached his chin

  nellis was saying things too chiefly
directed at me but i scarcely heard them
and presently  was aware that he and his
friend had left us

  does it hurt bad muriel asked
bending over me as i continued auto-
matically to rub my shin

  oh no

  what are you rubbing it for then
she asked again this time in the half-
vexed half-solicitous tone of a mother
addressing her youngster lets have
a look at it

  i was interested myself strange as
it may seem it was with a sense of
satisfaction that having exposed the leg
i discovered a slight abrasion and a
tinge of blue on the skin i wished there
had been more abrasion

  the big brute muriel exclaimed
as she tied her own handkerchief around
the hurt im glad you licked him

  i caught baldwin grinning he told
me later that if he hadnt been handy to
pull us apart nellis would have finished
the fray by carrying me down to the
beach and giving me a ducking

  but i dont quite agree with baldwin
in that

v

  what do you intend to do after you
get the polite little slip in your pay-
the love-story of a human cog



envelope baldwin asked me two days
liter

   polite little slip

  regretting that owing to the neces-
sity of cutting down expenses or some
such bunk the company will hereafter
try to get along without your valuable
services youre in for it oliver nellis
is the champion knocker-you wont be
the first one he succeeded in getting
canned i suppose ill get mine next
for butting in as i did

  i am awfully sorry old man i said
if i should be the cause of it

  dont think for a moment i blame
you oliver i believe i would have act-
ed as you did if i had been in your
shoes if i should get fired id be most
concerned on account of gertie bald-
win paused bending to strike a match
 the sole of his shoe you know
he went on facing the floor gertie and
i are feeling different about everything
since last sunday

  different

  sure baldwin blushed yrou
chump do you want everything with a
spoon 

  then i saw they have it all settled
come what will gertie and baldwin
have made up their minds to fight it out
together it must be great to be one of
the parties to such an understanding

  i havent seen muriel since last sun-
day and i dont know just how i stand
with her for she had very little to say
on the way home she was quieter than
i ever thought it possible for her to be
i have an idea that she knows nellis po-
sition in the office and consequently has
her misgivings as regards my job mu-
riel wouldnt waste her time on a man
otft of a job-or would she i dont
know muriel is such a puzzle

  if she should say to me job or no
job money or no money it is you and
i together through thick and thin what
wouldnt i be capable of doing

vi

  poor nellis i almost wish i could
feel sorry for him

  it appears that to-day after he had

told his little story the chief who other-
wise is far too busy a man to trouble
about investigating such matters had a
few minutes to spare i divined the rea-
son when i was called into his office
and it puzzled me that i should be sent
for at all since it is well known that he
considers the polite little slip in ones
pay-envelope the easiest and most ex-
pedient procedure of discharging em-
ployees

  nellis was present he looked nerv-
ous and avoided my glance the chief
came straight to the point

  arent you hurting your reputation
oliver r he asked me with a frown

  no sir i answered as soon as he
paused not in any way whatever
i believe that some of the timidness
was knocked out of me last sunday
ordinarily the very shock of the impli-
cation would have made me stammer
and appear guilty

  eh the chief ejaculated with ap-
parent surprise no well i couldnt
bring myself to believe it of you thats
why i called you

  he paused again regarding me with
more interest than he had shown toward
me in all the years i have worked for
him

  thank you mr carman i said sim-
ply

  the chief turned to nellis let us
have it all from the beginning he sug-
gested just as you told it to me

  i cant see the use of it mr carman
nellis objected i have told you and
if you dont believe me-

  it isnt a matter of disbelieving you
at all the chief interrupted him calmly
i want to give oliver a fair chance of
vindicating himself if he can

  i had the firms interests at heart
nellis asserted heatedly checking up
my statements like this doesnt seem nec-
essary

  oh doesnt it said the chief coldly
well i dont quite agree with you
among other things he addressed me
evenly nellis tells me that you spend
a good deal of your time at cabaret shows
in the company of disreputable women
now you know very well i cant have
that kind of man working for me
-



breezy stories

  i had it on my lips to call nellis the
blackest kind of a liar but luckily  had
enough sense to realize that the chief
would be more favorably impressed if i
kept cool so i simply said

  if youll give me three minutes of
your time mr carman  tell you just
how much of it is true

  fire awav said the chief

  then paving no attention to the slan-
derer i looked the chief straight in the
eyes arjd told him not the whole story
but whatever i thought had direct bear-
ing on nellis charge it took longer
than three minutes i believe it took ten
but not once did the chief interrupt me
with words to the enect that the time
granted was up

  that doesnt sound a whit like your
story he said to nellis when finally i
was through

  nellis by this time had himself well
in hand

  no he said carelessly i never
thought it would it is for you to decide
whom to believe mr carman ill only
say this that mr thompson would never
have thought of doubting my word

  mr thompson is nellis powerful rel-
ative it required but little penetration
to perceive that he was reminding the
chief of his influence but right there he
committed an awful blunder-i was sur-
prised that he didnt know his man bet-
ter than that as i have sized up mr
carman he is by nature too much of a
real fighter to tolerate any attempts at
intimidation especially from a subordi-
nate and i felt certain that whatever
had been his position before he was now
against nellis though any one that didnt
know him would have thought that he
was rather pleased at being intorfned
of the touching intimacy with one of the
principal stockholders

  oh is that so he said pleasantly
but with an ominous glitter in his gray
eyes but in what way could mr
thompson possibly be concerned with
this case why mention his name at
all mr nellis why

  thank you thats all the chief dis-
missed me and so i missed nellis an-
swer as the door closed after me i
heard the chief repeat why

  a few minutes later nellis passed me

on the way to his desk where he began
packing together his personal effects i
bent over my work and when i looked
up again he had left the office

  half an hour later the chief called me
again

  finish whatever work you have on
hand he addressed me formally and
get up the necessary data for your suc-
cessor he paused i think to study
the puzzled look on my face nellis
resigned he added in his usual grouchy
tone i think that you might be a like-
ly man for his job anyhow im going
to give you a trvout you can take his
desk in the morning

vii

  i kept the good news to myself bald-
wins astonishment when he sees me at
nellis desk in the morning will be worth
the small effort of restraint besides
i didnt want baldwin to tell gertie who
of course would lose no time passing the
news to muriel

  early in the evening i called up mu-
riel

  when did you last see the sun go
down i asked her

   was just watching it slip down over
the housetops when you called up she
replied

  let us watch it set together i sug-
gested well get out in the park in
plenty of time to see it if we take a

taxi

  taxi cried muriel im surprised
at vou a jitneyll take us out just as

fast

  so we went out in a crowded jitney

and very little was said on the way

  there is a bench out in the combina-
tion park and wilderness that very few
people seem to know about it is situ-
ated a little way off the main road and
a narrow path through a thick under-
brush leads to it it is in a state of de-
cay sagging at one end and its back has
been defaced with a great number of in-
artistic incisions of mortally wounded
hearts initials and dates of twenty years
but it commands a view toward the west
the love-story of a human cog



of a great expanse of water and directly
below it the green waves dashing
against cliffs and boulders chant the un-
broken melody of eons that secluded
spot has been a favorite resort of mine
on tranquil evenings but more than
once have i experienced a sense of guilt
when the crunching of dry leaves behind
me announced the approach of two
would-be engravers of hearts and ar-
rows and i heard their vexed disap-
pointed oh pshaw  or words to that
effect

  clearly it was my lucky day-the
bench was unoccupied at first muriel
didnt like the looks of it she felt like
walking and reminded me of the walk-
ing race i still had coming to me but
as we had come out to see the sunset she
finally consented

  i never knew there was such a place
in the park she said how did you
come to know

  oh i spend a lot of time here dream-
ing how nice it would be to watch the
sunset from this bench together with a
girl like you

  you surprise me

  in what way muriel

  i never thought it possible that you
could use such language

  isnt it good language

  oh perfect

  a pause ensued during which the big
disc of liquid gold sank all too swiftly
into the sea a veritable maze of things
to say beautiful and sincere things mere
sentimental drivel suggested themselves
to me but at the moment they all seemed
a little irrelevant

  did you get the heel on your shoe
fixed i asked in order to keep the con-
versation going

  i bought a new pair she replied
with low heels

  that makes you only half an inch
taller than i am i am glad you got
low heels

  there it went said muriel alluding
to the last gleam of the disappearing sun
it seems funny to think that it keeps
right on going doesnt it i suppose if
you travel fast enough toward the west
youll see it setting all the time

  and it would never be night you
didnt get your brooch fixed muriel
stupid old brooch she muttered
would you smile if i got you an-
other

  she withdrew her hand from nine
and her tone sounded formal

  if you feel that way-

  but you know i went on again tak-
ing possession of her hand that id
sooner get you that little piece of jewelry
that looks like a doughnut

  her hand warm and limp in mine
clasped about my fingers

  would yott really take the chance
  why should i be afraid

you love your ease so much pretty
soon youll find it quite a bother to be
tied to a nervous live wire like i am
i need a live wire like you to stir
me up once in a while i confessed

  i believe you do said muriel
what you need is a monthly or weekly
scrap

  her lips smiled and her eyes took on a
dreamy expression i divined that she
already saw a vision of one of those
scraps and found it amusing

  oh laddie she went on with low-
ered voice returning the pressure of my
hand but still looking away i care for
you much more than i used to for i
know what you risked when you fell out
with nellis and you did it all for my
sake and i like you because he lacked
you as i despise him for doing it and
she added her voice trembling between
laughter and tears i cant help loving
you for the way you made a cannonball
out of yourself when he insulted you
then it is all settled i whispered
after i had kissed her but since you
know what nellis can do sweetheart-i
am sure to lose my job

  whatdowe care r said muriel caress-
ing my hand youll get another job
and if it takes time well be as saving as
we possibly can its all so different
now dear i never really cared for that
cheap imitation of a gay life it was
only nellis and his kind that made me
believe i did

  that makes it all the easier i said
striving very hard to speak composedly
you and i wont have to pinch muriel

 nellis lost his job through knocking
 me and ive succeeded him i am now

 muriel was dumfounded she wouldnt
 believe me at first

 how much money have you got in the
 bank  she asked me bluntly after i had
 told her of the interview with the chief

 it was just like her to ask such a ques-
 tion but she was entitled to know

 two thousand dollars i told her

 again she kissed me honest she
 laughed i love you twice as much

 the thought of all that money seemed
 to render her speechless with joy for the
 next minute

  by thomas j betts

it rained it was a real north china
rain for three days it had been
raining-three days of downpour
that had converted the roads to
sloughs dissolved all the painstakingly
erected boundary walls flooded the en-
tire wang mansion with the exception of
the kavg and finally brought down the
southeast corner of the wang roof with
a crash

  this last catastrophe was the cause of
hsing chis being sent out to obtain a
board to cover the aperture hsing chi
was sent because she was the strongest
girl and therefore best fitted for the er-
rand iccordingly she took the family
umbrella and sallied forth

  wang ma ssu had philosophically re-
sumed his pipe and was just commencing
his observations on the weather intend-
ing to incorporate therein sundry re-
marks on the slowness undutifulness
and general undesirability of female off-
spring when hsing chis voice was heard
to declare piercingly

   a dead outside-country man

  dead  ai verily this place and
house are cursed wailed mrs wang
already we have famine and flood and
now we shall be persecuted for the death
of this foreigner aii-i-

  silence woman ordered the patri-
arch then to hsing chi is he really
dead

  i cannot look came hesitatingly
from hsing chi

  the gods spare me from like female
spawn i shall see myself give me the
umbrella and ma ssu half stepped half
waded to the threshold

  he had no need to go farther almost
at the door lay half-submerged in the
yellow mud a form clad in what were
once white ducks even as he watched
it writhed and twisted hideously

  huo ian-the cholera remarked the
father sententiously



  ai-i- began his wife only to be

checked by his stern glance the old
man remained in an attitude of thought
for an inordinately long time his face
assumed the vacant look of the mongo-
lian immersed in contemplation mean-
while the bundle at his feet writhed and
twisted and bubbled in the mud at last
the master spoke

  take him inside

  but it will bring us bad luck disfavor
law suits-

  silence woman this man is at pres-
ent dying if he dies on our threshold
we shall be blamed if we take him in
and he lives we shall obtain great re-
ward if he dies we can bury him se-
cretly and no one will be the wiser be-
sides am i a man and a father to have
my will gainsaid by such as ye take
him in having delivered his pronun-
ciamento ma ssu returned to his dry
comer of the kang his pipe and his
philosophic content while the rest of
the family struggled in with the straining
white form and laid it on the driest damp
spot to be found

  thus came harry foster to the house
of wang

  swish-swish-swish

  foster stirred and slowly opened his
eyes how heavy they were the ex-
ertion seemed too much for him so he
let them drop down again it was an ex-
quisite feeling to lie there in a glorious
state of helplessness lie there-where 
his curiosity first sign of convalescence
began to assert itself where not in
the japanese district-he remembered
leaving it in the small hours and the glow
through his eyelids proclaimed day-how
many days later he did not then know
he was not at home he was conscious
of a different atmosphere from that of
his bachelor quarters where then 

  swish-swish-swish

  stop it  he tried to mutter peevishly
--------

breezy stories

only to find utterance impossible stop
what he thought he must find out it
might give him a clue to his whereabouts
his eyes must open there

  in a flash he caught the salient details
of his surroundings mocha-colored
walls of mud blackened toward the ceil-
ing with sable soot a few rude pieces of
furniture worn and polished by the
hands of a generation of users to the
same all-pervading hue rendered an as-
pect of hopeless monotony he lay on a
matting-covered kana-the north china
bed radiator and isie of safety-which
conveyed from the blackened fireplace
opposite through a flue in its interior to
the rude chimney by his side such of the
smoke and heat as did not escape into
the room the only cheerful note in the
squalor was a fugitive sunbeam that
gliding through the cofkn-length door
rested upon his face all this he saw in
a flash before his eyelids fell of their
own weight it was enough it showed
him where he was  and if he needed con-
firmation the atmosphere a mingling
of stuffiness steaming millet and just a
hint of fish afforded it he was in a
chinese house and the house of a low-
class chinaman at that

  swish-swish-swish

  what was the noise he must find
out a glance would do it carefully he
located the sound it was to the left by
the fireplace he must husband his
strength and make sure of the direction
now for the effort employing all his
strength he rolled back the heavy lids

  there crouched against the fireplace
was a girl a chinese girl and yet pretty
-pretty from the foreign standpoint
her huddled attitude as she scraped the
big pot her torn and dirty clothes her
disheveled hair all could not conceal the
fact that she was pretty sallow-skinned
she was and almond-eyed with high
cheek bones still she was pleasing to
the eye of a dissolute foreigner who
barely lived and that due in no measure
to himself all this in a glance then
the leaden lids would not be denied but
sank heavily over his eyes and he was
falling falling falling

  thus came hsing chi of the house of
wang into the life of harry foster

  what followed next was natural al-
most inevitable take a young ameri-
can college man place him in a treaty-
port where as in no other place not
even in clapham itself does smug brit-
ish middle-class conventionality reign so
supreme let him make a few false
steps call too infrequently upon his em-
ployers wife call too frequently upojj
some ones else and he attains social
ostracism take now this social outcast
and steep him injudiciously in alcohol
after a due season the effects may be ob-
served to consist in a fondness for more
alcohol a taste for the japanese quarter
social extinction in the wrorld of gentle-
men and a quasi-respectable position in
a quasi-respectable firm owned by a half-
caste of doubtful reputation after three
years this descent had finally brought
foster to the wang mansion here the
downward course paused only long
enough to take on hsing chi to whom it
seemed-and was-no decline but rather
a soaring flight higher than her hopes
had ever conceived then the descent
continued until together they ended in a
neat red-brick mud-roofed dwelling on
the outskirts of the foreign settlement
foster had reached bottom he kept a
canary

  whatever fosters moral degradation
might have been a physical improvement
was clearly shown he found his socks
carefully darned his ducks always
spotless and for he was not nat-
urally alcoholic his craving for drink
gradually abating he had already
dropped or had been dropped which it
was hard to say from the club he had
shunned or had been carefully excluded
from the society of the women of his
own race for over a year so he merely
continued to taste the accumulated dregs
of degradation with a compensatory bit
of sugar thrown in as for hsing chi
she was thoroughly happy reveling in
servants and clothes and food all of
which she had merely experienced never
enjoyed before her life was idyllic in
the extreme

  in fact it was too idyllic she began
to feel something rare in a chinaman 
supposedly unknown in the female of the
kind anj most injudicious in a chattel
the canary	

like hsing clii she began to feel an
interest in foster an interest which
grew into an ownership she began to
feel proud of him to exult in him and
one day she became aware of a fact a
great gripping momentous fact and she
was blissful in the thought that there
soon would le an indissoluble bond be-
tween them and that he would be hers
hers hers

  and then came miss allen tall blonde
and with a fascinating cool superiority
that was too evidently ingrained in her
nature to be thought of as a pose some
time previously miss allens father hav-
ing possessed himself of a generous por-
tion of the money then alloat in wall
street was allowing himself and the
street a period of mutual recuperation
to keep his mind away from all business
cares he sailed on a pleasure trip to eng-
land he returned much refreshed and
with most of the stock of brigglesworth
and jones-a fixture on the coast since
the day of the clippers accordingly
when his daughter granted him an inter-
view one morning and explained her in-
tention of going around the world via
london and siberia he had provided her
with a dependent and dependable chaper-
on ordered all the outposts of briggles-
worth and jones to see to her safety and
comfort tendered her a letter of credit
kissed her most successfully if some-
what unaccustomedly and clambering
into his limousine ordered office

  in due course miss allen reached tien
chou and the open arms of briggles-
worth and jones there she remem-
bered-she forgot only when necessary
-that harry foster who had amused
her at times was in the vicinity so
she demanded him after sundry hints
from her hostess as to what was the
thing had only evoked a counter hint
as to the eligibility of the chief assistant
of the branch for promotion thetaipans
wife asked foster to dinner very
formally he declined

  miss allen was puzzled but not in the
least angry her will was so seldom
thwarted that she was quite at a loss as
to what to do one evening after tennis
she met foster very decent he looked
thanks to hsing chi and the dependent

and dependable chaperon being dis-
missed they had a most pleasant talk of
the places and people they both knew
eventually foster never knew how he
had promised to come and see her wtiat
is more he came and came again miss
allens hostess was aghast the commu-
nity was shocked but what cared they
the infra-man and the super-woman

  he came again and yet again there
were walks and rides and billiards and
singles on the private court then of
course it happened and kisses were ex-
changed and the old heavy seal ring left
his little finger incidentally there were
confessions followed by swift forgive-
ness the injunction to never do ifi
again and his removal to the ports
apology for an hotel

  hsing chi was too much wrapped up
in her approaching triumph to notice any-
thing at first true that fa her lord
was out occasionally but that was only
his own good pleasure and as such to be
respected true also that certain of her
own sex and race made insinuations  they
were merely envious besides it was
manlike to lapse occasionally and there
was that which would bring him tjack
again

  then came the crash intensified by its
appalling suddenness an old harridan
yelled to her across the mud wall that
fa the outsider has left you shameless
one to go with the tall foreign woman

  loyal hsing chi did not believe it
fa her lord would return soon and give
that east-west the lie she would wait
and be reassured she waited one day
two days oh the agony of that wait-
ing  then the zealous neighbor in-
formed her that fa the outsider is at
the hotel go sell your goods and return
in your shame to the gutter whence you
came suddenly she felt that it was all
true

  she would go to foster she w-ent-
and was turned away distracted she
returned to the little red house what
could she do  slowly her meagre intelli-
gence revolved the possible courses of
action gradually a final hope was
evolved she would go to see this great
lady and plead with her for her own

  feverishly she donned her best a

weird exotic combination of pinks and
greens and reds hastily she arranged
her hair brushing it with oil until it
shone and glistened then she sped at
first though her gait was ever growing
slower to the taipans house

  miss allen was bored prettily bored
daintily bored but nonetheless undeni-
ably bored she consulted her little
watch pettishly three oclock and it
was beneath the dignity of a foreigner
to stir before four-thirty she permitted
herself the luxury of a yawn for the
first time in her life she wanted to pack
her own trunks anything to occupy the
next hour she longed ardently for the
land of the free-free to pack their own
trunks if they so desired she was glad
she was leaving the next day and yet
-these subtle bonds of the east she
languorously stretched her lithe limbs
reveling in the silky feel of her negligee

  catlike footsteps pulsed outside and
there came a scratching at her door

  come in lee

  the door softly opened and lee glided
in six feet of sallow noiseless deference

  missee outside have catchee one
piecee china girl wanchee talkee you
my have talkee you no can see she
say you mus see makee plenty bobbely
my tinkee you tellum go way she go
jus now plenty much lose face

  miss allens face assumed its custom-
ary hauteur what could a chinawoman
want with her it was preposterous
lee should have known better than to
interrupt her siesta she would have the
woman sent away at once the whole
thing was absurd and-it was an hour
and a half until tea after all this un-
known woman with her unknown mis-
sion might be interesting she was sure
to be more interesting than the collection
of new books the pride of her host
all of which she had read just two years
ago and it was an hour and a half
until tea

    let her come in lee you stav here
perhaps she doesnt speak english

  lee flitted out noiselessly efficiently
giving a sense of restful ease

  lt-le hsin chi sat in the shade of
the kitchen terrified lest she should fail
to gam entrance still more terrified lest

she should succeed lee reappeared
calm and majestic

  the presence desires your appear-
ance come

  she was to see the goddess might
she be given strength to plead the
gods help her and her love for fa i
trembling she followed through halls as
large as the whole little red house up
stairs that seemed li high she per-
ceived the color of hangings and em-
broideries the dull glint of ancient
bronzes the sheen of polished brass as
a blur of shimmering tones that only
enhanced the power and magnificence of
that one whom she had come to con-
front

  they reached a carved door at the end
of a hall lee scratched at it characteris-
tically a clear voice-her voice-rang
out in the foreign tongue and he swung
the barrier open motioning her to enter

 she got in-how she never knew-
and stood dazzled a little vari-colored
blot in a mass of soft tones everything
was in tawny brown harmonious yet
each brown individual and distinct the
pongee curtains differed from the tan
walls both curtains and walls struck a
different note from the tientsin rugs
the ningpo varnish of the woodwork
was yet another brown the covers of the
furniture were a delicate expression of
the same color while through the great
french windows the room was flooded
with the tawny northern sunshine
there standing in the suns rays its
light playing on the lustrous silk of her
negligee enhancing the whiteness of her
ivory skin and making an aureole of her
gldrious golden hair stood the presence
tall cool assured regal

 hsing chi looked and looked and
looked how could she dare

  gutter-bred do you forget your
manners 

  lees voice brought her to quickly
she made the correct salutation iier left
hand across her breast down on her
right knee until her limp right hand
touched the floor then she arose hum-
bly yet with a certain dignity trying to
conceal the love and hope and fear that
were swirling and eddying within her
she must speak now was her chance
the canary	

  hesitatingly punctuating her plea with
  rhythmic bobs she began 

    oh illustrious lady the small one
  knows that you are good sees that you
  are beautiful trusts to your pity and

i asks-

    what is she saying lee

    she talkee you blong plenty good
  look see

    oh miss allen who in spite of
  being inured to admiration was never
  displeased with it smiled tell her to
  go on

    hsing chi took heart the pleading
  in her voice was ably seconded by her
  tight-clenched hands and asks-and
  aks-you not to take away her-her
  man oh great lady you mighty self
  does not need him  to me he is the sun
  let him stay let him staj do not
  i take him from me

 plopcr my talkee she talkee what

    go on lee

    she talkee have got one piecee man
  bjong she you takee him away

   miss allen smiled it was a hard
 smile but still it showed gratification
 after all was she not being paid the
 supreme compliment that one woman can
 tender another this was doubtless one
 of those who had participated in the
 past which harry had abjured for her
 sake on the whole she thought the

rsituation was interesting to her it wras
new she would prolong it

what does she mean

 hhat man

    mighty presence i allunworthy that
  i am love and used to hold fa ho yie
  now you have looked upon him and he
  sees me no more you can have many
  men why take mine for he is mine

 mine mine-my all and now-ai-i-

  she began the long northern wail check-
  ing herself until the sobs died and then
  went on he is so much to me to you
  lie can never be the half she sank and
  half shuffled half crawled to the whfte
  womans feet you are great and i
  am small yet we be sisters thou and i
  we feel in the same way oh grant me
  my man-

  miss allen stirred uneasily she
needed no interpreter to understand

  show her out

  hsing chi understood the gesture
hastily she began again

  oh lady yield him to me i beg
i pray he is mine not yours mine by
right i carry that within me that makes
him mine give me back the father of
my child breathing convulsively her
arms folded against her breast hsing
chi paused

  miss allen raged this is too much
i will not stand it i refuse take her
away at once

  hsing chi rose tall she appeared in-
congruous no longer she seemed the
impersonation of the long-suffering east
risen at last dignified and defiant

  tell her she cried with outstretched
arms tell her that a womans curse
rests upon her that a mothers curse is
on her head  the attitude could not be
long maintained she grew shrill and
strident

  tell her tell her

even the wind seemed hungry as
it shrieked and buffeted about
the little cabin the snow
drifted in through the cracks to
lie in piles or slowly melt to sluggish
pools according to its proximity to the
stove

  allen herrick sat by the little square
cookstove in which a fire mutinously
spluttered he had on a great coat and
held his hands over the stove while he
gazed at the swirling snow out of the
one remaining pane in the half sash of
window his face was pale and his
hands looked thin and blue he rose
and walked to the box which did service
as a cupboard and searched its every
crevice he had done this repeatedly
during the morning and as before his
search did not reveal the smallest crumb
impatiently he threw the tin dishes on
the floor and kicked them out of his
way again he sat by the stove

  for a fortnight he had not eaten a
satisfying meal and now for three days
he had not tasted a morsel the state
of his hunger was becoming acute the
cold seemed unendurable in his famished
condition yet his only choice was to
shiver here in his own cabin or loaf
about the saloon farther up the strag-
gling camp there the evidence of a
few eatables aggravated his misery be-
sides the men gathered there more than
half suspected his plight and their sym-
pathy was not of a sort tending to alle-
viate his suffering some one might
offer him a drink but even liquor was
too scarce to be lavish of now he had
never formed a taste for intoxicants still
when a day or two before he had been
ottered a drink he had accepted it be-
cause he thought it might bring relief
to his gnawing appetite the nausea
which resulted had been so much
worse than his hunger that he had

square meal

f raker

  no inclination to repeat the experiment

    the storm had raged for three weeks
  and showed no sign of abating many
  among the motley inhabitants of the
  camp had hone too much and others
  than he were awaiting slow crawling
  starvation only two men had anything
  to spare and they made the hungry pay
  dearly for whatever they got only the
  day before herrick had offered old peter
  skelton his claim for board till the storm
  should break but that shrewd old game-
  ster replied that the claim was worthless
  and that grub was worth too much just
  then to take any chances on herrick
  had even reduced his request to a small
  quantity of provision still the old man
  refused this morning he had offered
  it for one square meal but skelton who
  in ordinary circumstances had been an
  ordinary man was now playing for a
  fortune out of the sufferings of his fel-
  lows and answered that he had not a
  bean save for the gold in his fist

    herricks brain seemed whirling with
  the eddying snowt he took a picture
  from his pocket and looked longingly at
  the smiling face the features wavered
  grew dim then slowdy mingled with the
  heavy features and dull countenance of
  an indian face when again he seemed
  to waken his hands lay on the cold stove
  -the fire had gone out outside the
  window was the same confusion of drift-
  ing white

    he began pacing rapidly about his
  cabin to warm himself and to endeavor
  to think clearly he could see but two
  ossibilities before him if he remained
  ere there was no doubt death was not
  far off and the alternative-he had been
  thinking of it for days always with dis-
  gust either way all was lost he must
  find some way to justify himself it wras
  an expedient which life necessitated
  buttoning his coat up tightly and pull-
  
the price of

ing his cap low over his eyes he went
out into the storm that seemed taunting
him as it shrieked and buffeted him
about he went to the saloon hoping to
find some way yet to escape his dilemma
all was as it had been for days the
same men playing the same game the
same men winning the same men drunk
or drinking they were all ruffians and
herrick knew them for what they were
though it was warm here the atmos-
phere reeked wtith tobacco smoke and
foul odors he felt better out in the
storm so soon went out again he strug-
gled about through the snow drifts till
completely weary he turned resolutely
toward the substantial log house of peter
skelton

  he was let in by the half-breed wife
who greeted him none too cordially and
watched him closely through her half-
closed eyes the smell of baking bread
of the pot of beans and hot coffee roused
his appetite almost beyond control
walking to where an awkward square-
built girl sat by the window he ad-
dressed he with a friendly greeting

  the girl grinned at him showing her
large even white teeth no coyness
shaded the gleam of pleasure in her dark
eyes he began some light conversation
about the storm which she answered
dully never taking her gaze from his
face his appetite was growing ram-
pant so though his very soul revolted
he plunged desperately to the purpose of
his visit

  you do not know how lonely it is
down at my cabin maggie he said
dejectedly ive been thinking of you
for days until to-day i could bear the
loneliness and the thinking no longer
and have come to tell you that every
word was intrinsically true he held as a
sop to his conscience you know ive
nothing and am a pretty worthless shift
all right but ive come to ask you if
you are willing to promise to become
my wife

  maggies wit had followed his words
slowly but she comprehended his final
meaning her face shone with emotion
as she threw her arms about him and if
his reception lacked warmth she did not
notice it in her own abandon

square meal	

  as soon as the mother had understood
the drift affairs were taking she busied
herself about her work and began set-
ting- dinner on the table

  i seem to have come just at dinner
time he said apologetically i guess

i	better run back for a bit

  maggie protested laying strong de-
taining hands on his arm and the old
woman spoke sullenly pointing to a
place at the table

  better set down and eat a bite the
men wont be up from the saloon fore
dark well eat and not wait on em

  for his own sake and to keep from
betraying his real condition herrick
struggled for self-control with every bite
maggie sat and watched him too satis-
fied to need food when she found op-
portunity she confided to him

  dads been trying to make me marry
old sandy because he has them big
mines but i wouldnt do it because of
you

  for the time herrick was glad he had
not lost his last chance for a dinner

  as the men returning passed the win-
dow old pete saw something which
saved the intruder from being kicked out
without any preliminary ceremony in
the firelight he saw maggie seated beside
herrick on the bench with her arms
about his neck

  herrick explained his presence in a
manly and straightforward manner
which made an impression on the greedy
old man and the girls evident delight
reached something in her fathers heart
she was his trump card but after all
he could doubtless use herrick to his
advantage however his suspicion was
not disarmed he had a good deal of
experience with the world and a shrewd
insight into human nature

  ill o k the proposition if you will
marry the girl right off he gruffly con-
sented

  herrick pleaded his lack of means and
the embarrassing position in which it
would place him trying to conceal his
own repugnance to the proposal and
how deeply he was disconcerted

  that dont figure at all i guess you
know ive got plenty the old man re-
plied maliciously  wont have you


breezy stories

bangin about and palaverin round my
girl you marry her to-morrow or old
sandy does

  he saw that reasons or objections
were useless and to seem to hesitate
would only make the situation worse
he had gone too far to retract that
would be to fall old petes victim he
felt too weak and ill to try to contend
with him his head was giddy he had
sprung a trap which was closing on him
and he was not able to try to escape

  you know we do not do so among
our people pete but i am willing to
meet your wishes what do you say
maggie 

  the girl replied rudelv without the
suspicion of a blush suits me all
right

  so it came about that herrick found
himself wanned at the great fireplace
eating his fill of sour-dough bread beans
and bacon with strong coffee earning
in the wood and making himself handy
about the house of peter skelton the
relief was so genuine that at first he was
almost content two days after his mar-
riage the storm broke the next week a
dog sled arrived with mail from dawson

  there was a long lega -looking en-
velope for alien herrick and he has-
tened to read its contents his uncles
lawyer wished to inform him that an
accident had at one stroke instantly re-
moved from earthly concerns both his
uncle and cousin and respectfully in-
formed him as the only surviving rela-
tive that he was sole heir of the estate
estimated to be worth nearly a million
dollars herrick looked at the postmark
the letter ltad been in dawson a week
at die time of his nuptials

  lie thrust the envelope in his pocket
and sat looking out across the sunlit
snow trying to find some philosophy in
the course of fate skelton had been
watching him closely and took the lib-
erty to make an inquin

  news eh he asked

  yes herrick answered frankly

 my uncle and his son have both been
instantly killed in an accident

  skelton had noted a lawyers address
on the envelope and his eyes narrowed
sigmiicntly

  not the worst news perhaps some-
thing coming maybe he queried

  herrick shrugged his shoulders i
hardly think so the old man had a
little i believe but he is not likely to
have thought of me

  as soon as he could do so without
observers herrick burned the letter for
he dared not trust peters inquiring
mind

  the following days passed by monot-
onously and a fever began to bum in
his heart he was moody and restless
inwardly he cursed the irish in maggie
wishing that she possessed the stolid
indian disposition of her mother but
she clung to him lavishing on him a sort
of dumb affection like an uncouth ani-
mal her caresses were almost unen-
durable and he daily loathed his posi-
tion more intensely

  he looked forward eagerly to the
opening of spring it was with real joy
therefore that he hailed a proposal from
skelton to make a trip to juneau some
business demanded his presence there
and he wished to bring back a supply of
provisions so he purposed taking her-
rick and a half-breed driver to help him
part of the way returning and if they
chose they might all go down to juneau
to be doing something to be out in the
open was unspeakable relief he had
not yet decided what to reply to the
lawyers communication nor had the
least thought of escape from his present
condition come to his mind he had re-
solved to strike out for himself in some
enterprise in the spring and not remain
the mere puppet of old peter but had
not decided what it should be he in-
tended to fulfill his nominal obligations
to maggie though in just what way he
had not determined

  he had spent his life among people
who observed the normal ideals of so-
ciety and had conformed to them simply
as a matter of course he had scarce
given them a thought or made a venture
into the philosophy of social relations
now he clung to the traditions of his peo-
ple as one sinking clings to a plank he
now recognized bis weakness in giving
way to his hunger for what it was but
he did not realize that his present chafing
the price of a square meal

was because of the same lack of endur-
ance

  a ship from san francisco rode at
anchor at the wharf of juneau as
herrick looked at her a mad desire to
run away seemed to overwhelm him at
night he could hear the soft lapping of
the waves they seemed to be enticing
him away to freedom he could not
fight with himself in his small room so
he dressed and went out to walk the
street at length he found himself at
the wharf whither he seemed to have
come without his own volition

  it was dark but he could see the gen-
tle rocking of the white ship a man
pscd near him and halted watching
him herrick addressed him civilly and
was soon in close conversation with the
captain of the ship the tide was in
they were making ready to put off as
the life convict leaps for the one chance
of possible escape herrick grasped this
opportunity without reflecting

  the captain was very moderate in his
demands and smuggled him on to the
boat when the captain considerately
died of an over-indubrence in his favor-
ite scotch the day before they put into
port herrick thought himself fortunate
indeed and had small change to tele-
graph for money for the remaining ex-
penses of his journey from seattle

ii

  once again in his ok place among his
own people the northland seemed only
an unpleasant dream and he could al-
mo- persuade himself that the ties that
bound him there were a mere nightmare

  during the summer the girl with the
fair face was away and he hoped she
would wed the other man and save him
from embarrassment but early in the
fail she returned he went to see her
to convince himself he argued with his
conscience that she was irrevocably lost
to him he found her frankly glad to
see him more charming and winsome
more wholly to be desired than ever
i he pain of being near her was too
kteat so pleading a business engagement
he soon took his leave



  he resolved that he would not seek
her company again and for weeks
bravely kept to his purpose one day
as lie rode toward the country fleeing
from his longing to see her he met her
by the wayside with her runabout dis-
abled he had no choice but to take her
home ard there he lingered throwing
his resolution away thereafter he
came frequently always moody and re-
served always resolving not to go again
and as often breaking his resohe for
he hungered for her presence and like
the hunger of his body in the alaskan
winter it mastered him

  one afternoon they walked down to
the little gate of the garden and stood
for a while to watch the sun setting far
across the water she had been silent
and preoccupied suddenly she raised
her lovely face to his and spoke slowly
and gently

 why do you always come and go
away thus alien you seem jd when
you are w ith me and not as you used to
be w ill you not tell me what has come
between us

  i have no right to the pleasure i have
filched no right to impose on you he
said bitterly

  but you do not tell me why must
this be all we may have

  if you love me it should not be-it
can not be if you wish it i am wholly
yours for i love you

  herrick wrestled long with his con-
science that night not for the sake of
the girl at the north not even for the
sake of the girl he loved but because he
felt the odium with which the thing he
was about to do was branded at length
he justified himself doubtless maggie
had married again and he was free save
in a technical sense besides he had
always felt that his alliance with her was
a bond for which he was hardly respon-
sible still he knew how the other girl
would regard the matter she might
forgive his marriage but she could
never forgive his desertion of the obliga-
tions he had assumed

  ten years go quickly and the north-
land had almost vanished from his
thought one afternoon he found him-
	breezy

self in a crush caused by some trifling
accident to an electric car as he edged
his way through some one lay hold of
his arm turning he looked into the
shrewd eyes of peter skelton one of
the strange chances of fortune had-
brought him thus in a throng elbow to
elbow with the one man he feared to
meet and had never expected to encoun-
ter having once found his man skel-
ton was not to be eluded and herrick
dared not try to escape him

  herrick tried vainly to buy him off
but the old man had always held a suspi-
cion that herrick had worked a trick on
him only to get something to eat and
guessed there were ways in which he
could pinch his reluctant son-in-law
tighter than by accepting any amount of
ransom money consequently he sud-
denly developed a fine standard of honor
and family pride maggie had remained
faithful in spite of all suitors and pater-
nal suasion besides there was a son so
the old man would hear of no terms that
did not include herricks immediate re-
turn to his deserted wife

  herrick knew he could expect no
mercy from the old man should the
existence of the woman and three bright
children down by beautiful monterey
become known to him he was able to
keep this knowledge from him and skel-
ton accepted a liberal sum of bills as the
price of his silence which was rein-
forced-or more correctly enforced-by
herricks declaring he would never go an
inch or pay him a cent if in any way
their relation was divulged

  when two days later the sitka
crossed the bar and turned her prow
northward herrick and peter skelton
were both on board herrick had de-
cided to comply with his father-in-laws
wishes as the only means by which he
could save those he loved from the
shame he had put upon them he could
better bear to pass out of their lives still
loved and sorrowed over than remain
and lose their esteem for them too he
felt it the easier way

  skelton realized that herrick was
more surely his prisoner than if he were
taking him in chains peter had no fear
of his attempting to escape him again

stories

yet he searched for the secret of his
return he knew well that herrick was
aware that his marriage with maggie
would not hold in court he shrewdly
guessed there wras some one from whom
herrick was keeping the knowledge of
his relation to her at this cost being
himself insusceptible to the influence of
refined honor he sought vainly for the
bond that held herrick

  meanwhile allen held himself aloof
and silent pale and worn he paced the
deck his manner and appearance awed
peter as no outburst could have done
resignation had imbued him with
strength

  they were nearing the end of the voy-
age when peter approached him as he
stood at the stem with his arms folded
looking away to the south

  think youll look up mines again
he asked i can show you some good
claims a little farther back than you
were herrick

  skelton did not understand the smile
with which his offer was greeted

  no was the reply i shall not un-
dertake mining nor invest in any opera-
tions

  skelton eyed him closely you have
maggie and the boys interest to con-
sider

  they shall be provided for herrick
answered dryly and skelton was com-
pelled to go on without satisfying his
curiosity

  a pack-train met them at skagway
herrick moved listlessly about among
the men busy loading their animals
watching their preparation without in-
terest suddenly an altercation arose
over the loading herrick heard the
course of abusive language interrupted
by a boys high-keyed young voice then
the ruffians rejoinder smote on his ear

   not have any squaws brat boss-
ing me

  allen faced about to see the tense
figure and flashing eyes of a slender boy
in the instant he knew him one
thought burned itself into his hearts
center-these words were spoken to his
son

  he stepped before the ruffian and
the price of

spoke in a quiet even tone i think
you are making a mistake

  the man started to make a foul re-
ply but cowed by the quiet voice and
steady eyes turned away grumbling his
curses the boy also ready to resent
the interference of a stranger held back
the hot words

  can i help you my boy herrick
asked

  no i can manage my own business
the boy replied roughly but a strange
feeling went tingling through his veins
the stranger had struck some till now
unknown chord and something like the
thrill of a glad song had come to him
in that brief encounter spirit had called
to spirit and each had answered back

in

  standing at the window maggie
watched herrick toiling up toward the
cabin little allens lithe figure came
close behind their forms showed dimly
among the darker shadows of the trees
in the heavy twilight she had been
waiting long for they were late to-day
her anxious ears had heard the cry of
the wolf and her keen eyes had caught
the occasional glimpse of some gray
form slipping among the shadows

  now she hastily opened the door and
the red firelight shone far out to welcome
them

  herrick came in stamping oft the
snow a glow on his face and a buoyant
light in his eyes which the crisp air and
tml had infused into the physical man
little allen greeted her gaily hallooing
as he came up the path he sniffed the
odors of the prepared meal with evident
delight maggie standing aside the
stoical coarse heavy figure of a rquaw
looked on and was happy

  herrick placed a round of fat deer on
a lench the boy threw his burden on
the floor and with a whoop of excite-
ment brought forth a shining skin
silken it shone m the firelight as he
stroked it maggie ran her fingers
over it

great luck to-day maggie herrick

 square meal	

said touched by the pleasure of his com-
panions

  you have had all good luck this win-
ter she replied you will be going out
of here in the spring it was half a
question a thought she wished answered
yet feared to ask

  no i shall not go farther than to
sell the furs and buy what provisions we
need

  maggie squatting in the firelight con-
tinued to stroke the beautiful fur but
she did not see it her mind was work-
ing dully with the pain of a disappointed
child she wanted to cry to him to take
her away from this dreary solitude to
the beautiful southland of sun and flow-
ers but she dared not speak her wish
and the stoical blood of her race held
her silent

  she was roused by herrick throwing
fuel on the fire

  you have been gathering bark to-day
youve no need to do such work he
spoke in gentle reproof

  she rose and spread her hands in a
gesture expressing weariness

  its so still here all day alone i like
to be outside she explained

  he started to chide her for the heavi-
ness of the work but looking at her
square figure he realized with sudden
revulsion of emotion that to her this
was not hard work

  full appreciation was meted to the
meal spread on the rough table the
physical man throve in the fresh air and
exercise which the long tramps hunting
and trapping required

  the table cleared herrick lighted a
lamp whose clear white light gave the
rude furnishings of the room sharp re-
lief books were brought and the boy
and man bent together over them for
the time absorbed in their contents

  maggie sat watching the look of affec-
tion soften the tense lines of the mans
face and the bright flashes of interest
and pleasure that lighted the boys dusky
eyes the strange figures and signs were
cabalistic to her but she was content to
sit thus and watch them their presence
and their pleasure filled her with a deep

  this was herricks hour of happiness
breezy stories



the close companionship of this un-
spoiled child the satisfaction of watch-
ing the work of the keen young mind
the absorption of the task made him for
the time forget all else

  after a while the dark eyes grew
drowsy the pencil slipped from the
fingers with a laugh that was low and
happv herrick pushed the books aside
the boy flung himself into his fathers
arms and snuggled his head on his shoul-
der herrick held him close with his
cheek on the boys crisp hair in his heart
holding with him three other fair chil-
dren

  come son go to bed before you
are asleep he said gently shaking him-
self free that was a long tramp to-
day and to-morrow we go up the north
trail

  the boy turned at the door and spoke
a merry good night mammy then
with the new love alight in his eyes he
said good night m dad

  herrick turned out the light drew his
great heavy chair before the fire and
dropping his head back sat looking at
the dancing flames

  he never thought of conversing with
maggie now he even forgot her pres-
ence

  she was seated on the other edge of
the hearth with her face turned from the
light her hands clasped about her knees
watching him with the same loving so-
licitude with which she had regarded
him since his return she had thought
possible financial needs had driven him
to come so far away in the solitary life
of a trapper he had been so fortunate
that she had looked forward to going at
least as far as the coast towns when the
winter was past his positive reply this
evening had deepened the wonder in her
mind

  when he had come back from his long
absence she had asked no question
time had brought her stoical indian na-
ture to dominate any emotional impulses
for the most part she was silent and
inexpressive perhaps also she was
mentally even duller than in her girl-
hood his return had been to her much
as the coming of the sun after the long
darkness that he was with her was

enough at first but by little an unrest a
question grew he was not happy he
was hiding why 

  there was always some barrier be-
tween them which she could not compre-
hend now it was like the clear cold ice
of the winter she quickly learned he
preferred she would not touch him and
never save to offer some aid did he ap-
proach her yet lie was kind even
tender in word and act never vexed
never impatient-she had never imag-
ined such a man the men she knew
were all abusive on occasion domineer-
ing demanding to be served perhaps
it was because he was more truly a demi-
god to her than a man and her love more
adoration than passion that she tolerated
his attitude toward her

  watching his sad drawn face as the
firelight played over it the feminine sud-
denly sensed the other woman for a
while she sat silent-watching then
in the stillness a wail broke from her
the wail of the wild like the notes of the
indian dirge

  herrick startled grasped the arms of
his chair and leaned quickly forward
speaking her name

 she is making you unhappy you
love her and she has driven you away to
grieve how could she hurt you  the
words burst from her for it was clear
to her now as a revelation

  at the first outbreak herrick was
too amazed to find his voice master-
ing himself he rose and taking her
hands firmly in his own he spoke sternly
to her

  maggie you do not know what you
are saying there is no one of whom
you speak no one has hurt me no one
has made me unhappy

  but you are sad you hurt and she
laid her hand on his breast

  if i am hurt i have hurt myself and
no one is to blame but me you are
alone too much i did not think of that
in the spring you shall go where you
please there is plenty of money you
must go to bed now

  she went meekly like a chidden child
herrick stood for a while before the
fire maggies outbreak had left him
disturbed at length he took off his
the price of a square meal



heavier garments and threw himself on
his couch

  he had slept long when he awoke with
a feeling akin to alarm without mov-
ing he opened his eyes maggie sat
crouched before the dying fire her chin
resting in her hand he closed his eyes
and lay quietly

  for a long time she sat there then
came and stood beside his bed he
opened his eyes she looked down qui-
etly at him no vestige of her emotional
outburst of the evening remained she
spoke in dull heavy tones

  i see she said its me keeping you
from her i am breaking your heart
but i didnt know you must go back

  he closed his eyes to the smarting
pain never in his noblest mood had he
considered her in the beginning he had
taken thought only for himself and later
all his care had been for the woman he
considered truly his wife maggie had
been an encumbrance

  her outburst bad startled him both
with the intensity of her passion and her
regard for him he realized he had al-
ways looked on her much as an uncouth
willing animal lgly stupid dull in
mind and expression this had been a
revelation of the unselfish devotion of
her heart and of what his love meant to
her

  his pity for her and his incrimination
of self made this the bitterest night he
had yet known

  he soon rose and built a blazing fire
glad to chase away the shadows of the
night with its cheering light maggie
came dull and stoical as ever to per-
form her homely tasks she cooked the
savory meat and prepared mush and hot
biscuit the steaming coffee was just to
his taste herrick found it difficult to
believe the experience of the night other
than a hallucination yet once when
he raised his eyes he found her looking
at him with the look of the suffering
dumb brute in her eyes the food
choked in his throat and he felt like
crawling to her on his knees

  little allen was anxious for the day
and talked eagerly of its prospect not
noting the silence of his companions

  were not going out to-day son

herrick said maggie looked up in sur-
prise ive been leaving you alone too
much maggie he continued and
youve gotten strange notions into your
head so were to have a day together
what would you like

  we could go with the sledges up the
river and shoot she said brightening
like a child

  all right you take the sledge and
dogs if you like maggie he consented
heartily i will go with you on the
skees

  they were turning homeward and
maggie aglow with the sport urged her
dogs down die slope making for the ice
of the river a crackling of crust the
sliding of a mass of snow and dogs and
driver went hurtling over the precipice
to the ice below

  herrick placed the poor crumpled
body on the sledge and hastened to the
cabin where he gave such first aid as
he could maggie was far beyond his
helping so they set out for the nearest
place where aid could be had

  when they reached the camp it was
evident that effort was useless old
peter was sent for

  as long as life remained herrick
fought to save it from going out he
dared not think he dared not face his
own heart a strange hush seemed to
lie on all his faculties and everything
but the present was void

  when the end had come he saw the
path lie clear before him without hesi-
tating he turned to what he had to do

  when the last care had been given he
approached skelton

 you know where the cabin is
skelton nodded ive had fine luck
if you care to go up you will find enough
to pay for the trouble you are welcome
to all there is

  and you skelton asked

  i am going to make my way south
as quickly as possible

  there will be no boats up yet skel-
ton reminded him

  no i shall probably have to make
my way overland as i can

  and the boy-
	breezy

  i take him with me herrick said
quietly

iv

  everywhere the flowers were in the
riotous profusion of late spring in the
dooryards on the lawns clambering the
walls of the meanest as well as the
richest of houses by the roadside
wherever a cranny could be found a
flower blossomed

  it was late afternoon as a friend and
confidant of the herrick family turned
up the steps to a terraced lawn passed
a cypress hedge and  to the wide
porch of a handsome cottage he asked
for mrs herrick

  she came to greet him in the sunny
parlor where allens favorite deep red
roses mingled with the pure white of
her choice she had made no change in
their way of living

  i have a special mission to you mrs
herrick her caller said when they were
seated

  it is word from allen she cried
impulsively she had been fighting to
be calm but the tension had become
beyond her endurance

  good word i sincerely hope he
said quickly he wished me to come
to you

  then he is returned she interrupt-
ed why did he not come himself 

  you must be calm the old doctor
replied i can not answer your ques-
tion but he sent me to tell you he is
here and will see you whenever you
wish

  he is here here where i can see
him do you mean then tell him to
come

  she had risen to her feet and stood
clinging to a chair he took her hands
and spoke sternly

  alicia i know nothing of the expla-
nation which allen wishes to make i
know nothing of his affairs beyond the
business he has put in my hands but i
have reason to believe that what is be-
fore you will be a severe test of vour
strength and courage you must con-
trol yourself

  i am quiet now i was startled but

stories

i am ready now and i thank you will
you send allen in

  she heard his step on the walk and its
firm unwavering tread quieted her
pulses she stood by one of the long
windows across the room from the door
he would enter she was yearning to
hasten to meet him yet poised ready to
flee from him

  the first glimpse of his face assured
her faith and destroyed her fear
stronger and finer of form he looked
than when he had gone away his face
deep-lined had a look of resolution
which bore evidence of suffering but not
of shame a little cry of pain rose to
her lips but did not escape

  neither spoke but with eyes looking
deep into hers he crossed the room and
halted a few feet from her his arms
folded on his breast

  i have come as quickly as i could
he said in a voice slightly husky to
place my love and the way of my life in
your hands i will tell you all whenever
you wish to hear

  why wait she cried i have
waited all these months why spend
another hour in this suspense oh tell
me what it is

  i fear it will not be easy for you
you have had one shock perhaps you
need rest to prepare you for a greater
trial

  i could not rest she smiled faintly
i should be distracted you will please
go on

  so beginning with the storm of the
alaskan winter he told her the story as
it concerned himself and the half-breed
girl he told it almost bluntly making
no plea for himself

  changing emotions played over her
white face only once a sound escaped
her when he told her of maggies re-
nunciation she gave a strange gasping
moan

  when it was over he continued i
decided to come back and tell you all
whatever relation shall exist between
us you are to decide only i want you
to know how i have loved you always
and you only strange as it may seem

t have done all t did because of my
love for you and i swear to you as
beyond the stars



god is my witness that i have kept un-
tarnished the bond which is between you
and me

  and the boy she asked faintly

  he is with me but he need not share
our home if you choose we shall have a
home but i can not give him up alto-
gether having him to love saved my
reason and my faith

  she moved to the door without a
word there she paused

  i will send for you when i have
thought it out she said you will not
go away oh i cant bear that you
should go away she faltered and was
almost swept back to him with the sud-
den rush of emotion she clasped the
door-frame to steady herself i must
take time and think she added really to
herself

  i will not leave until you bid me he
assured her

beyond the stars

   by ethel pomeroy

 until that strange gray dawn when we were parted
 our hopes were twinned and all our joys our tears

 were born as one how eager and child-hearted
 we wandered singing through the golden years

 but now you are where only dreams can find you
 and only memories our love renew

 while unforgotten days still serve to bind you
 close to a heart that hungers to pursue

 beyond the hills of god for which you left me
 beyond the stars whose voices now are mule

 do you regret the parting which bereft me

 or listen for the sobbing of my lute

 or is the heavenly music white with rapture
 unmixed with any strain of earth regret

 singing a song the sad world may not capture

 do you remember me do jou forget

  morning dawned with the dew on
grass and flower and the breath from
the ocean

  herrick stood out on the terrace he
had spent the night in the garden watch-
ing for the dawn now he was listening
to the awakening life around him he
heard a light step and turned his pulses
beating madly

  clad in a soft dress of dull blue which
wonderfully set off her pale face and
fair hair she came toward him there
was no need for words he opened his
arms and she clung to him holding
her there he looked down into eyes that
did not waver and held no trace of
pain

  then the lover triumphed he kissed
her brow her eyes her throat then her
lips in an abandon of long-restrained
passion

  at last she whispered and the boy
-he is to come to us
the wrong way

by hazel m

it has frequently been said of woman
that love constitutes her whole life
of man that love is just one of
several important factors in his ex-
istence however false this may be of
some women it was true of dolly ryan
as soon as she was able to reason about
such matters she decided that she be-
longed to the class of women to whom
love is practically everything or per-
haps it would be betterto say that she
belonged to the class of women who
admit that love is everything

  having made this important discovery
as early as her seventeenth year dolly
candidly proceeded to educate herself for
the responsible position which she ex-
pected to occupy in the future namely
that of wife to the man whom she loved
dolly went about this education in a
novel sort of way but there was novelty
in everything that she did it was a
part of her theory that a woman must
be different to hold a mans love sh
did not realize that to the man who loves
her every woman is different

  when discussing the subject dolly
would say wisely to her chum claire
dale most important of all is a wom-
ans physical attractiveness talk as you
will claire man is essentially physical
and an appeal to his senses is stronger
every time than an appeal to his mind
where women are concerned i mean
the trouble with most women is that
they win a man by their looks and after
they get him allow their looks to slip
away from them nearly always chil-
dren are the reason for this backsliding
unless a woman can make children a
secondary consideration she shouldnt
have them at all when she becomes a
mother she ceases to be a sweetheart
nine times out of ten for my part
with a glance in the mirror at her grace-
ful reflection dolly always managed to
be opposite a mirror when there was

rjorie smith

one in the room i hope i shall never
have any children because to me love is
the one big thing in life and my sole
ambition is to retain my husbands affec-
tion-when i get him

  but suppose you never find him the
man whom you could love queried
claire

  said dolly thats a foolish way to
talk there are dozens of men in the
world that a girl would love its just cir-
cumstances or chance perhaps that de-
cides which one it shall be

  so circumstances or chance perhaps
decided which one it should be for dolly
or it may have been the man himself
who decided for he made up his mind
to have dolly when he had known her
less than a month

  his name was jim barclay he had
been born in the town where dolly lived
but had spent the greater part of his life
away from home his father who
owned the largest bank in town and
was one of the leading citizens began
to fail in health and sent for jim to come
home and prepare to step into his place
in the future so jim came home

  dolly was just past twenty when he
returned there was an informal dance
at the country club a few days later and
dolly in a clinging green gown with
her cloudy gold-bronze hair low on her
forehead looked for all the world like a
sea-nymph at least so thought jim
barclay he had never seen a girl who
was so subtly feminine every move-
ment she made suggested round soft
curves and once when she paused near
him for a moment his pulse quickened
as he noted the satiny texture of her
neck and shoulders

  before the dance was half over jim
had some one introduce him to her and
he found her even more fascinating to
talk to than to look at she had a wide-
eyed candid way of gazing at a fellow
that was disconcerting and she was dif-
ferent from most girls she had none
of those silly advanced ideas that so
many womenhave these days jim was
glad of that

  i dont quite get this suffrage stuff
he confided to her i think a womans
sphere is in the home

  they were sitting out a dance on the
balcony

  dolly nodded acquiescence

 a home and a mans love if a
woman would only put all her heart and
soul and energy into making a success
of matrimony instead of wasting her
time on other matters there would be
more real happiness in the world

  she ceased speaking and gazed dream-
ily into space watching her jim bar-
clay told himself that there was more
to her than to any girl he had met here-
tofore they had four dances together
that evening and three of them were
spent in conversation on the balcony

  the seed of desire having been im-
planted in his mind he proceeded to fall
in love with her by degrees thrown to-
gether a great deal within the narrow
social limits of a small town they came
to know each other as thoroughly as is
possible for two people who do not ac-
tually live together within a month
jim barclay had fully decided to ask
her to marry him within a far shorter
space of time dolly had decided to ac-
cept him when he did ask her woman-
like she knew his mind long before he
knew it himself

  guided by an unfailing feminine in-
stinct she hesitated long before accept-
ing not thatshe had the slightest in-
tention of refusing she wanted to
marry she had reached the marriage-
able age and she felt that she would like
some one to lavish upon her all the love
and adoration of a strong passionate na-
ture that she must pay the price for
this as we pay for all that we get in life
did not enter her mind she only knew
that she wanted affection and a home of
her own jim barclay offered all these
things  he was fairly good looking and
clever enough and he had more to give
her in a material way than most young
men so when she was quite sure that he

cared for her she allowed herself to fall
in love with him

  the following december they were
married after a brief honeymoon they
came back and settled down in a charm-
ing bungalow on the outskirts of the
town not long after tims father died
and jim stepped into his position at the
bank

  so the first year passed by as it al-
ways does with astonishing revelations
of unsuspected twists and turns in the
characters of both and if their respec-
tive views on matrimony shifted about
more or less they continued to be as
much in love as ever

  certainly jim was not disappointed in
dolly she was as attractive physically
as she had ever been it was a sacred
rite with her to care religiously for her
body and keep herself beautiful always
xor did she neglect her mind when he
was worn out with a trying day at the
bank she was ever ready with diverting
chatter and charming little attentions
diligently reading up on various topics
she never failed to discuss intelligently
the affairs of the moment business did
not bore her and for a woman she
evinced a marvelous capacity for grasp-
ing an idea so jim fell into the habit of
talking over the days work with her
when they were comfortably settled in
the cozj living room after dinner dolly
had an adorable way of cuddling up in
his arms when they were alone ancf
listening to what he said with her whole
soul in her wide blue eyes

  dolly he declared one evening
when they had been discussing the tariff
question for over half an hour you
have more sense about business than
any woman i ever knew how the deuce
do you do it

  dolly just smiled mysteriously it
would have been poor policy to make him
understand that her sense consisted of
saying as little as possible and listen-
ing attentively

  because im married and have a
house to take care of is no reason why i
shouldnt think of anything else i try
not to be narrow jim

  but lots of girls imagine they arc
doing quite enough if the meals are al-
	breezy

ways cooked on time and the house-
cleaning done now you never have
any trouble with maids and the soup is
never burned or the dinner cold and
still you always manage to look neat and
dainty i guess i was pretty lucky to
get you and he squeezed her boyishly

  dolly laughed outright it is nice to
be hugged that way even if you have
been married over a year

  im glad you feel that way about it
jim said she demurely

  as indeed she was

  when a short time afterward she
made a startling discovery a horrible
feeling of impending calamity overcame
her it suddenly seemed to dolly that
the bottom had dropped clean out of her
world they had been so happy so
content and now just when they were
happiest this thing had to come some-
how the possibility had never occurred
to her to other women yes but to her
dolly

  oh its terrible she whispered to
herself jim and i were so happy to-
gether we didnt need any one else he
doesnt like children any more than i do
hes often said they were a nuisance
what shall i do oh what shall i do

  during the next few days the shadow
that threatened her happiness was so
black that in spite of her efforts to seem
her usual carefree self she could not
prevent jws noticing that something
was wrong

  he began to question her are you
in debt has the cook given warning
or are you worrying about your winter
clothes out with it sweetheart he
said assuming a bantering tone in order
to disguise his real anxiety

  dolly jumped at the excuse he sug-
gested its clothes really jim i
cant find anything fit to wear in this
town i think id like to go to new
york and shop this fall may i if
she could only get away until she could
come to a decision she might still find a
way out of her difficulty but she could
not think clearly while she was in con-
stant danger of jims clear eyes discov-
ering what really ailed her

  surely wait until next week and

stories

ill go with you a change will do us
both good he said cheerfully

  but that did not appeal to dolly she
wanted to go alone you dont know
what a serious shopping trip this is go-
ing to be jim ill be so tired out at
night that i wont feel like going about
vith you to the theatres and restaurants
we can go later for a good time ill
stay with madge shes been asking me
to visit her for years and shes lived
long enough in new york to be able to
take me to all the best shops please
let me go alone this time jimsey
madge an old school friend would be
the one to go to for advice if the hor-
rible possibility that threatened her were
really true

  jim good-naturedly gave in have it
your own way when do you want to
start 

  to-morrow as long as she was
going there was no sense in delaying the
trip

  seems youre mighty anxious to get
away from me sure youre not getting
tired of your old husband

  oh jim dollys arms about his
neck was the answer to that tired of
him when it was the dread of losing his
love that made her fear maternity

  he stepped into the hall for his over-
coat then came back to kiss her before
leaving for the bank she lifted her
smiling face to his every trace of
worry had vanished from her features
and her eyes had regained their custom-
ary sparkle

  good-by kiddie patting her affec-
tionately on one shoulder he was re-
lieved to have gotten to the bottom of
the trouble so easily pack your bag
and be ready to leave on the morning
train ill bring plenty of cash home
with me this evening

  as he slammed the door and walked
briskly down the steps he laughed aloud
to himself

  arent women the limit imagine
her worrying her entire system into a
state of nervous collapse over a winter
wardrobe i

  and he laughed again because the
idea amused him immensely

  dolly stayed almost a week in new
the wrong way	

  york she came home tired but content
  with a trunk filled with her purchases

   in a comparatively short time the
household was running as smoothly as
ever dollys laughter filled the rooms
with their customary cheerfulness her
childishly piquant face was wreathed in
constant smiles sometimes at night be-
fore dropping off to sleep she would
j breathe a fervent thanks that she had
 escaped an experience which might have
 wrecked her whole life

    now and then nature creates a woman
 in whom the maternal instinct is wholly
 lacking it may lie that dolly was just
 such a woman or it may be that the
 instinct was buried so deeply in her soul
 that the light had never found it

during the next three or four years
dolly made several trips to new york
but jim never raised any objection be-
i cause it seemed to do her good to get
f away

    so the years slipped by one by one
 with an unbelievable swiftness after
 a while they went about more in society

i spending less time together at home
 slowly but none the less surely their
 relations toward each other were under-
 going a subtle change jim found that
 it had become rather tiresome to sit
 about evenings it made him sleepy
 and disagreeable of late it seemed to

 him that there was something strangely
 quiet and unalive about their artistic lit-
 tle home but if dolly had come to feel
 the difference she gave no indication of
 it except that a restlessness had taken
 the place of her former calm by such
 slow degrees had the atmosphere of
 their home life changed tliat she had
 unconsciously drifted with it into a state
 of mind that was less healthy less
 normal

    thus after five or six years of matri-
  mony there crept gradually into jims
  thoughts the realization that something
  was lacking in his life just at first
  the feeling was uncertain and vague
  then it began to assume a more definite
  form when the bank closed in the
  afternoons he no longer hurried home
  a be had done in the early years of their
  married life sometimes he went to the
  club where he lounged around drinking

 moderately or perhaps got into a friend-
 ly game of cards sometimes he played
 golf but he never went home until the
 dinner hour drew near

   when she finally realized the change
 that was coming over him dolly was at
 a loss to understand it wherein had
 she failed a sickening dread that per-
 haps she was not going to be a success
 as a wife after all made her weak with
 the thought of the utter void that the loss
 of his love would make in her life be-
 cause she was completely wrapped up
 in loving him in holding his affection
 the roots of her being had twined them-
 selves so strongly about his existence
 that to tear them away now would mean
 that she must droop and wither like a
 plant deprived of sun and water

   feverishly she searched her brain for
 an explanation and remedy

   ive never gone to breakfast in curl
 papers or a wrapper she moaned help-
 lessly he cant find any fault with the
 way our house is run but he doesnt
 come home early like he used to and he
 seems to be thinking all the time hes
 here of an excuse to get away i might
 have known such happiness couldnt last
 men are all alike

   because she was dazed and worried
 to such an extent that she lacked the
 power to reason clearly dolly made a
 fatal mistake she began to nag if
 there is one thing in all the world that a
 man tries to avoid it is a nagging
 woman where he had previously
 stayed away from home for no apparent
 reason jim began now to stay away
 because it got on his nerves to have her
 continually reproaching him for his neg-
 lect

   couldnt you get here a little earlier
 jim dinner has been ready half an
 hour you never used to be late a
 sigh where do you spend all your
 time surely the bank doesnt keep you
 so long where have you been

   club

   oh the club you seem to be aw-
 fully fond of the club lately

   jim finished his soup and began to
 glance over the evening paper

   dolly toyed nervously with a spoon

   are you going out to-night
	breezy

  um-humph 

  biting her lip in vexation she tried
again

  theres a rather good show in town
id like to see it

  he lifted preoccupied eyes to her hurt

  oh nothing you never pay any at-
tention to what i say anyhow why do
you read the paper at the table jim
surely you can find time for it during
the day i never see you now except at
dinner and the least you can do is to try
to be agreeable

  groaning inwardly jim put down the
paper and tried to begin some sort of
conversation but dollys mind was oc-
cupied with other matters so she was
unable to converse with any great show
of intelligence instead she watched
him with a haunted suspicious expres-
sion in her eyes while he talked it
bothered jim to be watched that way so
with a muttered excuse he left the house
as soon as the meal was over

  their life went on like this indefinitely
had dolly been another sort of woman
by adjusting her views in accordance
with the situation the break in their
daily life might have been mended and
things would have gone on as smoothly
as before though on a different basis
it is impossible to drift easily through
existence on an equal mental plane
since ever-changing circumstances alter
the mental and moral ideas of our asso-
ciates we too must adjust our views
from time to time

  some women seeing their dream of
romance crumbling to the ground and
knowing how futile it is to try to rebuild
it carefully lay away the remains in the
most sacred recesses of their hearts and
relinquish it with a secret sigh of sor-
row forever adjusting themselves to
life as it is they centre their interests
upon something else sometimes they
lose their individuality completely in the
bearing and raising of children and they
are content sometimes they become ab-
sorbed in womens clubs or in charities
and again they are content but some-
times as with dolly they refuse to relin-
quish their hold upon the golden thread

stories

of romance and the thread cuts ever
deeper into their souls as the years pass
by and they never find peace

  one evening jim went home to din-
ner with john carter the cashier of the
bank of about jims age he had been
married a year or so before jim and
dolly his wife a plain comfortable
little person who was seemingly oblivi-
ous to the flesh she was putting on of
late bustled about her face flushed and
moist a straight wisp of hair straying
unheeded across her forehead as she
helped the one maid lo put the dinner
on the table a boy of five clung to her
skirts impeding her progress at every
step finally she stopped in despair

  johnny she said reprovingly why
cant you stay in your place when i put
you there

 she lifted him in her arms and
plumped him down in his chair his fist
in his eye johnny looked to be on the
verge of tears so she patted his close-
cropped head lovingly and gave him a
cake from the sideboard

  hes so bashful she explained as
very much out of breath she sat down
at the table he never lets go of my
skirt when we have company

  hes a fine-looking little fellow jim
told her

  she flushed and her eyes sparkled
with pleasure

  do you think so but wait till you
see the baby shes only two years old
you know shes asleep now but shell
be awake soon

  great kid the babys father assured
him both of them are i made helen
have johnnys hair cut last week and
it nearly broke her heart to part with
the curls but one girl in a familys
enough eh son

  looking up shyly johnny grinned at
his father with perfect understanding

  jim wondered why he had always con-
sidered children a nuisance

  when dinner was half over lusty cries
issued from above proclaiming the
baby to be very much awake her moth-
er excused herself and hurried from the
room returning almost immediately with
the baby who crowed with delight while
the wrong way



  being settled in her high chair and be-
  gan vigorously to hammer the polished
  wood with a spoon grasped tightly in
  her chubby hand

    dinner over they went into the sit-
  ting room carter and jim smoked and
  talked business mrs carter sat under
  the light and mended with johnny and
  the baby playing on the floor at her feet

     presently the baby went to sleep and
  was taken up to bed johnny followed
  and mrs carter resumed her mending

    it was with a decided shock of sur-
  prise that jim awoke to the fact that it
  was past eleven the evening had gone
  by more swiftly for him than any even-
  ing had for a long time past he could
  not help remarking it

     by jove it seems only an hour since
  dinner  have to be gwing carter
  but its so cozy here i hate to leave

    mrs carter smiled pleasantly when
  he left urging him to come again car-
  ter repeated his wifes invitation adding
  bring mrs barclay with you next
  time

    jim thanked him and said that he
  would but he could not quite imagine
  dolly at ease in such a homely atmos-
  phere it did not suit her at all

    then suddenly it came to him what
  was lacking in their life it was chil-

	dren

     its queer i never thought of that
  said he to himself on the way home i
  wonder if dolly has noticed it poor
  doll she isnt as much to blame as i am

ive been a cad staying away so much
  lately but things might turn out all right
  yet theres no denying it children do
  brighten a place up a lot and make it
  seem alke a fellow has something to
  go home for if theres a couple of kids
  waiting for him and a woman with that
  soft contented look in her eves that nell
  carter has

    which reminded him of the haunted
  expression in dollys eyes of late he
  made up his mind to speak to her of his
  discovery the subject would be a dif-
  ficult one to broach considering their
  present attitude toward each other but
  jim was determined in his resolve

    he found the task difficult indeed

dolly looked at him suspiciously when
he spoke of it

  children what an odd idea for you
to have we decided over six years ago
that we wouldnt be bothered with
them

  i know but i thought-

  you dont like children youve told
me time and again that you cant bear

them

of course i have told you that i
always thought them a nuisance but-
dolly shrugged her shoulders replying

coldly -

  then why bring up a subject that
was thoroughly discussed so long ago
its rather unusual isnt it

  well jim told her gently that was
when we were just married most
women have children and they bring
them so much pleasure i thought per-
haps-you wouldnt be so lonely-so-
he floundered completely at a loss to
express himself dazed at the look of
contempt which she gave him a glint
of hardness crept slowly into dollys
eyes as a light of understanding dawned
upon her she smiled and there was
bitterness as well as grim determination
in her smile so that was it he
wanted to see her occupied that he might
have more time to himself and he
thought to tie her down with children

  dont worry about me being lonely
so long as you are enjoying yourself i
shouldnt think you need care what be-
comes of me

  the cutting sarcasm stung him to re-
tort but he refused to give way to anger

  dolly he pleaded listen let
me explain we seem to be all mixed
up and-

  cutting him short with a gesture she
disdainfully advised

  dont try to explain explanations
are a useless waste of breath

  she walked out of the room and closed
the door

of course it was futile to say any
more about it realizing this jim did
his best to forget the incident and so
banished it from his mind not so
dolly at last she had something defi-
nite to brood over the more she
thought of it the firmer became her
breezy stories

u

conviction that he wanted her to have
children so that her time would be fully
occupied as the germ of jealousy ex-
panded in her heart she began to enter-
tain all sorts of groundless suspicions
perhaps there was another woman  she
felt sure there was another woman

  who could it be there is nobody
i know of but that is no proof of
course there is some one else and he
wants to keep me quiet and thinks that
maternity is the surest way

  a nagging woman is bad enough a
jealous woman is worse the two com-
bined are impossible

  spring came and jim fell into the
habit of driving to the country club
every afternoon for golf often he re-
mained for dinner sometimes he sent
the car back for dolly and they dined at
the club in company with other married
couples but he enjoyed himself more
when she was absent dolly and claire
dale had become inseparable again as
they had been before dollys marriage
so he did not feel that he was leaving
her alone to any great extent

  it was at this time that beth norris
came into jims life she was past
twenty-five unmarried brimming over
with energy and the pure joy of being
alive behind her back the women said
slurring things about her to her face
they were charming beths social posi-
tion was unquestioned but in a small
town a girl of her age cannot do the
things beth did and escape unscathed
she went on her way unheeding how-
ever

  she had been traveling abroad for
years and had just come home to spend
the summer months finding time heavy
on her hands and being athletic she
took up golf as a possible form of
amusement often she met jim barclay
on the links and they got to be very
well acquainted there was no coquetry
in beths manner toward him hers
was a friendly attitude pure and simple
the same as was his own but they
found one another agreeable at a time
when each was in need of diversion so
they formed an innocent friendship
sometimes in the late afternoon after
several strenuous hours on the links he

drove her home from the club what
could have been more natural when
neither went back to town for the even-
ing they frequently had dinner together
many pleasant days passed in this
manner

  one afternoon when dolly was loung-
ing in her bedroom reading a novel
claire came up unannounced she kissed
her friend with unusual warmth and
perhaps just a shade too much sympathy

  how pretty you are looking dear
said claire as indeed dolly was she
was a trifle thinner than of yore her
eyes had lost their youthful brilliance
there was even a tired droop to the cor-
ners of her mouth but her bronze hair
was arranged with becoming care and
the pink silk negligee was just the right
foil for he sort of beauty

  thanks claire

  dolly laid aside her book languidly
there was something on her mind she
had been worried the last few days be-
cause the doctor had told her that her
system had run dowm and that she must
be careful of her physical condition or
she might easily go into a decline per-
haps-she shivered every time she
thought of it-perhaps consumption

  claire threw off her hat and sat on the
edge of the bed

  you havent been going out enough
dear you look pale

  dolly said she was tired

  claire looked sympathetic it seemed
inexplicably sad to her that a sweet lov-
able woman like dolly must waste away
her life caring for a man who was un-
worthy to touch the hem of her skirt a
man who spent all of his time chasing
after another woman every one in
town knew of jims infatuation for beth
norris that is every one except dolly
it was with regret that claire realized
wherein her duty lay but as dollys best
friend-

  doll said she abruptly i dont
like to tell you this but i think you will
thank me for it in the end

  dollys brows contracted pulling
nervously at the lace on her negligee
she leaned forward

  what is it she demanded sharply

  oh nothing much evaded claire
the wrong way	

she wished suddenly that she had not
spoken dolly was calm but insistent

  there is something claire ive no-
ticed it in your manner for several days
 think youd better tell me

  so claire told her

  for a long time dolly lay back in her
chair with her eves cfosed

  finally she spoke thank you for
telling me claire i know you meant it
for the best and now well say no
more about it will you have tea 

  claire breathed a sigh of relief that
dolly had taken the news so calmly
yes she said and then she began
eagerly to talk of impersonal matters

  but after her guest had gone dolly
dropped her head on her arms and her
slender body shook with uncontrollable
sobs it was true what she was
dreading had come there was another
woman she knew now why jim had
seemed different of late he was try-
ing to keep her from any suspicion of
the truth and she had thought that he
still cared some after all

  one day she was caught in a severe
rain storm and before she could get a
taxi she was drenched to the skin and
her feet were soaking wet as soon as
she reached the house she took off her
wet things but it was too late to pre-
vent the cold from settling on her lungs
and in consequence she was ill for sev-
eral weeks when she was finally able
to go about again she suffered from a
deadly lassitude and no amount of doc-
toring seemed to do her any permanent
good

  inertia so dulled her senses that al-
though she realized the state of her
health she was unable to interest her-
self in taking the necessary measures to
overcome the danger that threatened her
she felt nothing but the bitterest hatred
and jealousy her horizon had narrowed
until it contained only beth norris and
jim there was not even room for her-
self m her thoughts

  jim barclay had given up seeing beth
when he realized the true state of affairs
he devoted more time to dolly than he
had for over a year trying to be as pa-
tient and gentle with her as possible

the doctor had told him frankly that
she was going into consumption and
that only immediate attention would save
her when fall came with its raw cut-
ting winds and rainy unpleasant days
he argued and begged and pleaded with
her to go to a sanitarium until the win-
ter months were over but dolly was
stubbornly obdurate there was noth-
ing the matter with her she had a cold
that was all it was ridiculous to insist
ujon shutting her up in a sanitarium for
a slight cold on her chest

  one day when she could stand it no
longer she completely lost control of
herself

  do you suppose i dont know why
you want to put me in a sanitarium
she laughed hysterically you must
believe i havent any eyes do you think
i dont know about beth norris i
know youre in love with her i know
youve been seeing her in public all sum-
mer and i havent the slightest doubt
but what you still see her on the sly but
if-you imagine im going to waste away
my time in a sanitarium so that youll
have a better chance to carry on your
disgusting flirtation you give me credit
for being more of a fool than i am

  jim glared angrily thats a damned
lie  he said

  his indignation was getting the better
of his good judgment havent you
any reason left at all im not in love
with beth norris use a little common
sense

  common sense thats what i am
using thats why i have at length
awakened to what every one else in town
knows that you are chasing around
night and day after that-she choked-
that low unprincipled-

  jim interrupted

  thats enough dont pass judgment
on some one you dont know beth
norris is an admirable big-hearted
woman and nobody has a right to slan-
der her

  admirable you call it admirable to
scheme and plot to get another womans
husband 

  dollys face was flushed and her
breath was coming in gasps and you
can stand there and defend another


breezy stories

woman a wicked brazen hussy to mef
you think more of that creature than
you do of your own wife my god
what have i done to deserve this punish-
ment i have lived for you all my life
before you came and since then i ve
never been unfaithful to you for a mo-
ment even in my thoughts and now
you-you-

  suddenly she broke down and fell
sobbing into a chair

  jims eyes were the color of steel and
there were tense lines about his mouth
with a barely perceptible shrug of his
shoulders he left the room silently clos-
ing the door on her pitiful hysterical
moaning

  after that day their life together was
almost unbearable for months the
storm had been threatening and when
the deluge actually came it left in its
wake irreparable damage it was m-
possible for their life ever to be the same
again

  the weeks that followed were an end-
less torture to both slowly but surely
his love for her had been dying until
there remained only pity and when a
love like that which he had felt for her
turns to pity it is terrible

  dolly realized this and her heart was
like lead in her breast she knew now
that she had taken the wrong way
she had brought her misery upon her-
self  she had tried to circumvent nature
and nature had taken her revenge she
had avoided maternity at a fearful cost

  and now to add to the bitterness of
her reflections she realized that she had
defeated her own ends that jim had
wanted the children she had refused to
bear that contrary to her earlier beliefs
children would have strengthened the
bond between husband and wife not
weakened it as the mother of his son
she might have kept jims love as his
wife only she had lost it

  she began to fail rapidly and by
spring her condition was such that she
no longer had the strength to resist her
doctors orders so they took her to a
sanitarium

  for a while they hoped that she might
recover temporarily but as the time
passed the futility of such a hope was all

too plainly evident perhaps if she had
cared enough she might have gotten bet-
ter in time but there was nothing for
which she wanted to live her strength
was all but gone

 realizing this they brought her home
 at the end of the following summer so
 she lingered on day by day week by
 week a pitiful transparent shadow of
 what she had been waiting wearily for
 the end perhaps then would come the
 ace which she had failed to find per-
 ps it would never come who can say

it was late november dusk had
fallen and elusive flakes of snow were
scurrying through the air fluttering like
moths about the newly-lighted street
lamps two women hurrying by met
underneath the lare of light one of
them was claire dale she was holding
a muff against her face and her eyes
looked red and swollen as she would
have gone by the other stopped her
wait a minute claire

 claire stopped

 oh its you mrs neilson i didnt
 see your face

 the woman nodded

 yes whats the matter you look
 as though something was wrong

 claire gazed at her dully

 havent you heard

 mrs neilson shook her head

 no what is it

 claire shivered and took a deep
 breath she said

 dolly barclays dead

 oh

 ive iust come from there she went
 on in a lifeless tone the tears started
 to her eyes

 mrs neilson looked away

 its too bad she murmured sympa-
 thetically

 the twilight quiet was unbroken the
 snow fell softly

 consumption wasnt it mrs neil-
 son resumed in a hushed voice

 yes consumption claire repeated 
 consumption

 her voice trembled a sob shook her 
 body

 oh mr neilson its terrible he j

 killed her thats what he did he neg-
the girl who trux me down



iected her and chased around after that
common beth norris until dolly wor-
ried herself into a decline then she
just naturally went into this he didnt
even care enough to send her away-
until it was too late poor dolly she
adored him and never had a thought
of any one else i remember years
ago her voice faltered before she met
him even how she used to say her great-
est desire was to make some man happy
with her love

  mrs neilson looked off into space
repeating

  its too bad she was so young and
pretty its too bad

  claires breath caught in her throat
with a gasp as she pressed her hand
wearily against her aching head

  its awful she whispered hoarsely
as though to herself awful

  there was a silence long and tense
then

  god but men are brutes claire
breathed bitterly

  and mrs neilson sadly agreed that
they were

  and in his desolate home jim sat and
mourned not for the wife he had lost
but for the happiness he had never
known

the girl who trun me down

an appreciation

  by a iv davies

     gee but her tastes were expensive

     diamonds rubies and pearls

     all of these were the playthings

     of that paragon of girls

      silk her stockings and silk her skirts

      silk of a kind to rustle

she was sure some queen when she hit the street

     and she certainly made me hustle

     beer no she couldnt drink it

     champagne was the only thing

     she wanted a set of mink-skins

     and another diamond ring

     she wanted a new hat every week

     according to fashions jump

     she was dolled up right was that girl of mine

     and she certainly made me hump

     she wanted more than i gave her

     and so she trun me down

     id have given my life for her favor

     but t had to meet her frown

     im facing a sad and lonesome fate

     a fate i fain would shirk

     but im grateful still to my former love

a veracious account

by ralph e mooney

it began on a street car according
to my saturday afternoon habit i
went to the town of kirkwood in-
tending to strike out from there for
a long walk-thinking that i might note
something worth recording among the
various clay and rock strata which
abound in the district well the person
of whom i wish to tell you sat back of
me and coughed it was a disagreeable
hacking cough that was ill bred and
annoyed me at each explosion he sent
a gust of air upon the back of my neck
-air that was redolent of onions and
tobacco consumed in a pipe i shifted
about to show my displeasure and he took
to coughing in his hand which saved
me to some extent

  on our arrival at kirkwood i left the
car and started out for the country to
my surprise the man whom i had ob-
served on the trolley suddenly appeared
at my side and addressed me

  im up against it doc he said with-
out preliminary greeting im stone
broke and because im broke im losing
a chance to make some money thats
tough aint it

  quite-ah-tough 

  its raw

  and excessively underdone i sup-
plemented adapting myself to his con-
versation i observed that he employed
a strange degenerate yet not ineffective
english it interested me

  heres the proposition doc im
kayo mccartny-and fer fear you aint
received my tuesday reception cards-
ril explain that im mccartny the cham-
pion middle-weight prizefighter-which
decree as you calls it is easy to get in
this here country but hard to hold ive
had a run of hard luck i lost three
fights and the public got sore on me and
the sport writers tied the can to me
now honest and on the level doc every
one of them fights was square i broke

me hand in one and slipped in another-
and lost both then in the third-i dont
know-but losing twice and living fast
and such-i lost it too well talk all
you please-after losing to three second-
raters-the paper boys began to holler i
was crooked and yellow me yellow
think of that doc

  its preposterous i i assured him
any one can see that you are white

  thanks-you got wonderful eyes
doc and you are some wise well
anyhow since a year ago ive been a
starvin ive got a wife and two kids
-and were living in tenements i
couldnt get a fight all my money-
that my manager hadnt stole-id blown
in and there i was

  ah-out of work and out of money
i asked

  yep and with a wife and two kids
its all right doc-take your hand out o
your pocket-this aint a panhandle
story last week glory be i gets a date
to fight-and with a good man now
doc ive cut out booze-ive been livin
straight-and ive had a rest i ought to
go in there and clean up that guy and if
i do my rep  come back-and  get
plenty of fights-and this time ill save
my money

  then why are you-ah-up against
it 

  because doc ive got the chance and
i cant take it up you see its this way
doc ive got that fight on a cut-throat
contract if i win i win enough to put
me in clover for a year if i lose i get
nothing but you cant win a fight with-
out training doc and theres where im
up against it you need a trainer to put
you in shape-especially as old as i am
-and you cant do it yourself-i ought
to have a sparring partner-and most of
all doc i ought to have food a man
cant win on the grub i been getting
lately i need thick steaks-and eggs-
a veracious account



and good bread-and god knows i can t
anord em at home we been havin-
well anyhow im beaf in that fight al-
ready-because i cant get the right

training

  he looked away from me so hopelessly
that i myself was on the verge of tears

  its my rep doe the i-iold-you-so
bunch will be there they called me the
cheese champion after golden city
whatll they say now and not one of
them dogs-and many of em was mv
own brother once to hear them tell it
then-not one of them will lend me so
much as a five spot v ought to under-
stand doc-maybe youve worked at one
thing ter years and given your time to it
-now suppose you got a raw deal and
was tin-canned itr it  thats me-thats
what im going to get

  i am over-impulsive when i saw his
expression and thought of my own strug-
gles to master geology so that i might-
well at any rate  asked him

  how much money will you need 
  this aint a graft ferget it

  ill lend you the money and you may
pay it back after you have won your
fight

go on why you dont know me-
and itll be near three hundred dollars
the amount shocked me-but some-
thing urged me not to withdraw the of-
fer

ill lend you the money i repeated
he looked at me-a big rather worn
man-hi eyes squinting his kps trem-
bling he called aloud and took my
hand in a fearful grip

  doe ill take you dont ever let
anybody call you a rag-chewer or a piker
youre a clean sport and im for you
doc im for you r

  i was taken aback at his fervor

  bless me i cried bless me
xo-i wont bles you-or kiss you
ehher but say doc you just trail
around with me-and  show you how
to knock a man clear out of the ring in
a couple of weeks

  i thought that prizefighting was no
longer allowed in the city i remarked

         this aint to be a real right doc
purely a contest of skill--with a prize for
the pugilist who shows the greater activ-

ity-with a wink doc with a wink
get the wink

  to shorten my story-we returned to
the city and i secured the money for him
he insisted upon my going about with
him and seeing how it was spent he es-
tablished training quarters xn a hotel in
kirkwood and hired two negroes to come
there and rub him after his various forms
of exercise were completed he next en-
gaged the sen ices of a man w hose name
was lefty joe this was a cross-eyed
person who boxed with him i conversed
with lefty for half an hour one day
after which lie drew mccartney to one
side and i heard him say in a loud whis-
that i was a most amaxin man
gratified mei they then spoke of
some private matter between then joe
asking mccartnv where did he get it
and mccartnv replying that he caught it
on a country road

  i assume it referred to a slight
strain in my proteges arm

  i spent considerable time with mccirt-
ny in the next few weeks and watched
him do a terrific amount of work he
ran quite as our football candidates ran
he boxed ever so much more rapidly
than our physical instructor does in the
gymnasium he danced about fighting
with his shadow he tossed a medicine
ball and took k rg walks with me- he
was not the least interested in clay strata
-but persisted in calling talus mud his
wife and the two children came to the
hotel to live with him and i found her a
pretty little woman who had once sold
certain necessary articles of mens ap-
parel in a department store she said
she had loved mccartnv at once because
he was the first man who blushed when
he asked her to wait on him mrs  i e
-that was her name-was fond of kirk-
wood and soon discovered a little house
in a big yard which she said was an ideal
home she would stand before it for
hours and sigh just like a child at a shop
window

  i hope yon win this time mac f she
exclaimed-  if you do theres where
we live

  sure it winf he tokl her and they
both looked at me in a way that caused
uneasiness to predominate among my
	breezy

emotions they were so extremely un-
necessarily grateful

  how mccartny changed he took off
weight at one place but it was an im-
provement-and his face filled out his
skin altered from a glassy pink and white
to a smooth evenly distributed ruddiness
-then to a weatherbeaten tan his lips
curled up where they had curled down
and the wrinkles and hollows about his
eyes disappeared lefty joe came to
the point where instead of being merely
knocked off his balance during the box-
ing he would crash down and lie still
for several minutes when he would
awaken he would yell with approval and
declare that he was going to quit his
job but he never did

  as my new friends became more and
more happy something occurred which
caused me considerable mental perturba-
tion occasioning a most natural depres-
sion of spirits one day when i was re-
turning to the university from kirkwood
mrs lillie came in on the car with me
when we reached the junction where one
changes from the country to the city car
we both descended i to walk to the uni-
versity she to continue to town i chatted
with her until her car arrived assisted
her in boarding it raised my hat while
calling a cheerful good-by to the brave
little woman-and turned to look square-
ly into the sarcastic eyes of miss nettie

  now my friendship for miss nettie
has endured through several years she
is in every way a superior woman her
management of the girls dormitory sup-
ports that statement we have attended
many of the university functions together
and at certain times-while calling at the
dormitory parlor-our relations have
been extremely cordial once or twice
when the parlor was empty of others i
have summoned my courage and made
certain leading remarks which while not
flirtatious were intended to be construed
as giving evidence of the real affection
which i entertain for her once i
fondled her hand for a very short time
while we were chaperoning a dance in the
gymnasium at all such times she has
been fretful changing from cheerfulness
to petulance and sharp remarks

  at the junction i at once detected

stories

something in her manner which caused
my heart to beat unaccountably i am
afraid i stammered

   good evening professor curtis she
smiled-with such a menacing sweetness
-and pushed past me to board the car
i proceeded to my room much cast down
for i perceived that she was incensed
with me

  the next day was saturday and i de-
bated whether for the sake of appear-
ances i had not best remain at the col-
lege however i learned that miss net-
tie had gone to a matinee with professor
harris of the mathematics chair who
is an elderly and if you will pardon the
remark over-educated fool so i went
to the car resolved to visit my cheerful
friend i had boarded it and was seated
at a window reading when i heard some
one walking upon the gravel of the plat-
form outside it was miss nettie and
professor harris-of course that parsi-
monious individual would never have
wasted money upon a matinee perform-
ance when the day was half warm enough
for walking we all smiled cheerfully
and waved to one another

  dating from this incident commenced
a period when i was at a loss to conduct
myself in a way which would please miss
nettie when i called upon her a maid
would constantly interrupt us to inform
her that professor harris wished to
speak to her upon the telephone i took
her to a theatre presenting a highly di-
verting farce which concerned a young
man in love with a most jealous woman
and she told me that she considered such
performances improper and of a low
moral level i chaperoned a dance with
her and when i gave way to the impor-
tunities of some of the co-eds and en-
gaged in a tango or foxtrot she declared
with a cutting distinctness that made the
co-eds giggle that i never used to be so
much of a social lion-nor had i ever
proposed dancing with her i promptly
suggested that she become my partner
for the next dance which appeared but
to increase her resentment

   	consulted my savings book thinking
that if there was a sufficient balance in
the bank i might end this unfortunate
state of affairs by asking her to marry
a veracious account	

	me to my disappointment i was forced

i	to acknowledge that even with the three
 hundred dollars returned i had far too
 little money for such a venture miss

ii	nettie continued unreasonable and the
j time came when i was most happy while
 smoking my pipe in mccartnys training
 quarters-or while cycling beside him as

he trotted over the roads consequently
 i went more often to kirkwood after
classes and would not return to the cam-
pus until late at night miss nettie-and

 jou would never think this of so intel-
ectual a woman-deliberately threw her-
i self at harris if i spoke to her she
i replied in a sharp way that made me un-
easy

a day or so before the fight mccartny
j relaxed and i could not be with him

it left me with two evenings on my
i hands the first i spent with miss net-
tie and it was most uncomfortable she
 had an accusing way of looking at me
 that was disconcerting when i thought
to make up for my seeming neglect of
her and became in my demeanor a trifle
i more-ah-i will say affectionate
though that is scarcely the proper term
she became very angry indeed and told
me not to make an example of myself
before the co-eds and their callers and
to please sit across the table from her

   harris was calling upon her the next
 night so i dropped in at the parlors to
 see miss gilfillan assistant in the histori-
 cal department whom i have ever found
 to be entertaining if rather light we
 got along famously and as miss gilfillan
 was popular with the co-eds i had a time
 indeed to entertain her and the little
 group that clung about her i succeeded
 rather well i flatter myself by repeating
 naive philosophy in the curious slang of
 mccartny and lefty joe harris who
 is lost without a piece of chalk and a
 theorem to demonstrate said nothing all
 evening so the other couple sat at the far
 end of the parlor and listened to our
 laughter throughout the entire time

   when it grew late miss nettie came
 over to us and she looked at our little
 group so sharply that  feared she had
 lost control of her temper

   its ten oclock she exclaimed the
 evening is over

  as i was going out she caught my
arm

  can you chaperon a dance with me to-
morrow night she asked sigma al-
pha phi-at the gymnasium 

  now the next night was the night of
the fight and mccartny had made me
promise on my heart and honor to be
resent and watch his victory i knew
e would feel it deeply if i failed to be
present yet the thought of refusing
startled me and i felt embarrassed as i
made my excuse to miss nettie

  ah really i told her i have an-
other engagement

  oh im sorry

  there was something cutting some-
thing ominous and something withal so
poignant in miss netties voice that tears
all but came to my eyes

  too bad i remarked another
time

  another time she questioned and
the question of it was i may say ex-
tremely evident in her tone

  next day she met me on the campus
after classes

  where are you going to-night she
demanded

  this ws what i had been trying to
avoid to tell her was to tell the wrhole
faculty and the students as well that i-
a professor in geology and thirty-five
years old-was going to a prizefight for
they could never distinguish between a
mere contest of skill and a prizefight
never

  really i hesitated

  really its none of my business she
affirmed bitterly

  ah perhaps so now i uttered
these words before i thought i would
have given a medal of the french acad-
emy to have called them back

  perhaps so it is so professor cur-
tis and let me tell yon that if you keep
your engagement to-night you can make
no more with me if you go ill never
speak to you again 

  she left me then dumfounded

  how i spent the afternoon concerns
only myselt but suffice it to say that
after supper i had regained a more cheer-
ful frame of mind and had told myself
that i too might be lucky perhaps some


breezy stories

day when i was buying a pair of-of-
unmentionables and should blush as i
always do some faithful friendly girl
might-but at any rate i was fairly
cheerful i discovered an old english
book on prizefighting and in it saw what
clothes were necessary for such a func-
tion full evening dress was shown in
all the pictures-not even dinner coats-
boxing evidently being a gala event in
sporting circles

  so i donned my evening clothes took
my silk hat and set out the night air
was bracing the stars were sparkling on
a clear-cut evening in early autumn so
i felt more good-natured than in a long
while i even hummed snatches of the
blue danube waltz as i made my way
from the faculty dormitory along the cin-
der path which led past the gymnasium
and on to the car line i received a
shock when some one near the gymna-
sium cried heartily

  so cheerful curtis

  for it was harris of course with
miss nettie

  the bustle at the coliseum revived my
spirits i went to mccartnys dressing
room and found him nervous and de-
pressed his wife was with him patting
him on the back and laughing in spite of
tears in her eyes he was cross and told
her to stop that baby-acting and to get
outside where she belonged

  what did he weigh r he asked joe
in a husky tone

  joes answer displeased him for he im-
mediately cried out

  five pounds more than me didnt
that contract say he was not to exceed
three

  the manager of the institution was
there

  aw whatre you kicking about fie
growled gettin scared already

  joe kept silent after that and his lips
curled up again he saw me

  whatre you all dressed up like a
pall-bearer for  he said nastily there
aint going to be no funeral

  i came to wish you well i returned
conceding much to his nervousness i
shook his hand and proceeded to the seat
he had reserved for me

  my clothes  found were out of place

t possessed none that would have been
in keeping for  would die rather than
own to such green vests diamond studs
flaming neckties and i would die under
torture rather than go about as some of
the spectators did without a collar and
with uncleanly linen i quickly decided
that i would keep my coat on and would
eschew the new white kid gloves i had
procured for the occasion my hat cre-
ated considerable excitement one per-
son a youth of about sixteen stole it
from under my seat and horrified me by
asking an official to take it out and fill
it with a dimes worth of beer luckily
the man refused to do so

  added to my discomfort was a feeling
of concern for my friend mccartny all
about me men were saying that mccart-
ny couldnt return to championship-no
one ever did-and they speculated freely
as to whether he would be beaten in the
third round or the fifth one man risked
money that the contest would not last
ten rounds another who smelled of
whisky and who loudly informed us that
he represented mcginnis three star
distillery offered to bet me twenty to one
upon memphis oneill who was to
fight mccartny i gathered that twenty
to one meant that if mccartny should ac-
complish his purpose i would be paid
twenty dollars for every one which i
risked i had twenty dollars with me
and catching the exciting atmosphere i
wagered it i was soon sorry that i had
done so for i gathered from others that
memphis had longer arms greater
weight and was younger than mccartny

  a man stepped into the square plat-
form where the contest was to take place
and made a short speech he told the
audience that the champion of hoboken
was about to encounter the new orleans
baby in a select three-round contest he
seemed to be joking for he winked at
us quite often and the audience received
his words with a roar of laughter fol-
lowing this a negro and a white boy got
in the ring and proceeded to batter each
other thp men about me howled with
laughter all the time and told the white 
man to kick the other in the shins as 
this would have been unfair under the 
rules the white man sportsman-like re- 
a veracious account

 framed from doing so he won the fight
anyhow according to a sort of umpire or
 judge who danced about the ring with
them

there were two more such encounters
and a pause then a big uproar began

 i saw a powerful stranger climbing into
 the ring it was memphis my heart
 sank as i realized that here was the op-
ponent of the nervous and irritable man
l i had just seen in the dressing room

never was a more confident square-
 jawed rough-looking engine of brute
 force i asked the man of the whisky
 breath if he would not retract the bet
whereat every one about me laughed
the man refused to do so

   some one brushed past me-for i sat
 on the aisle-and i saw mccartny but
 he was not dispirited as in the dressing
 room-he was smiling and when he
  had gained the floor amid a few faint
 cheers i saw that he did not compare
 unfavorably with memphis he
 glanced my way and i noted that his eyes
 were snapping-and his lips wrcre so
 lightly poised in their smile as to make
 his jawrs fully as square as those of the
 other man

   in a moment or so they were fighting
 i had become quite sick at times during
 the other contests but now i felt thrilled
 this was to be the compensation perhaps
 for my own lost happiness and as for
 fmccartny his whole future hung upon
 it and it was not so brutal as the
 others there was more technique more
 finish to this performance

   mccartny was shifty and steady the
 other man seemed more deft and speedy
 in his wav of boxmg memphis got
 a round of applause after a fast passage
 i saw mccartnys head flip back once
 but could not tell how it was done it
 caused another outbreak the man of
 the whisky breath began to pound my
 back

the evening passed rapidly i w-as
busy watching each period of fighting
but during the periods of rest i felt it
i necessary to defend my friend in the an-
 grv arguments which beat about me

memphis seemed from the first to have

	an advantage for he hurried about and
i struck viciously time after time mc-



cartny stood steadfast weathering each
storm of blows and only replying occa-
sionally i noticed that when he did so
his arm moved quickly as a snakes
tongue-and his fist struck with a re-
sounding impact

  after three periods mccartny was
quite battered his body had red spots
upon it his chin jaw and forehead wrere
badly contused to judge from the flushed
appearance blood ran from his nose
and mouth and he came to look like a
torn old cat which i once possessed

  in spite of it he kept on and for all
i could see was just as steady as ever in
his maneuvering his opponent was lit-
tle hurt only a few marks upon his
body showed where mccartnys blows
had gone home memphis face was
untouched pink and leering always he
was refreshed quite frequently from a
bottle

  in the fifth period of fighting mccart-
ny dropped quickly to the floor he
arose slowly and i sawr it was an effort
for him to do so but he got on his
feet and went on fighting steadily

  hes a beggar for punishment old
tcayo  shouted the man with whom i
had wagered

  is that so  i asked well he is not
a beggar-hes only a little embarrassed
and tf you really think he will be pun-
ished i will say that this affair is en-
tirely within the law

  the whisky man swore

  in the next period mccartny was
pushed over against the ropes and seemed
dazed and unable to save himself from a
fury of punches memphis was deliver-
ing

  knock him out memphis the
whisky man roared knock him out

  why i asked sarcastically do you
want that if he does they can not
fight any longer

  the whisky man groaned as though in-
jured and slid down in his seat

  i wish youd go home he told me
youre spoiling my whole evening

  my mind was called to the ring at this
time by a sudden yell of excitement from
lefty joe i saw that memphis
was staggering back across the ring and
mccartny was in pursuit mouth open

breezy stories

i watched them wondering what had
caused this sudden change in affairs i
jeamed later that mccartny had while
apparently dazed craftily lunged at his
opponent and placed a severe blow on his
stomach

  the next few periods were thrilling in
the extreme

  at the very opening of the ninth pe-
riod mccartny delivered one of those
fearfully heavy punches memphis
maneuvered coyly to avoid it but while
his head was jerked out of the way the
fist struck upon his neck and-actually
tore open the skin the blood spurted
out and i cheered wildly believing our
moment of victory had come

  it did come too in the next period
when after a furious passage memphis
reeled back from mccartny stood limp
for a moment and then slowly collapsed
to the rloor i learned this was the re-
sult of those stomach blows of mccart-
nys memphis arose painfully but
was immediately knocked down again
and this time stayed down after a
brief period the referee umpire or judge
took mccartnys right hand and held it
above his head and the crowd cheered
they told me i had seen history in the
making which was an error due i sup-
pose to unfamiliarity with standard
reference works for certainly none of
them give attention to this sport

  i was sitting smiling happily when the
cheering had died of a sudden an up-
roar broke out near me i looked about
half a dozen men held the whisky gen-
tleman and were dragging him toward
me

  here you are sport they yelled
he was trying to do a sneak from us

  he paid me four hundred dollars gave
smaller amounts to others and swore
hed have us all arrested

  we were not arrested however

  mccartny came up then and shook my
hand effusively he had tears in his
eyes-very peculiar they looked in the
black one-and he was absolutely un-
able to express himself

  damn it doc-damn it doc i dont
know how to--why doggone it you four-
eyed old fool-say if it hadnt been for

-well now say doc-if ever you-might

have a fight of your own some time and
want me to train you-that is-doc why
darn it-im much obliged

  and he later paid me an astounding
sum of money i may hint that it ran
into the thousands

  you see doc i bet my purse if i won
and three hundred dollars of that purss
is yours so i bet your three hundred
-at ten fifteen and twenty to one

  he insisted on my taking it i left
after mrs lillie had kissed me on the
way home i felt gloomy i carried
enough in my pockets to push my savings
bank balance far above what was needful
to-but then miss nettie had told me
never to speak to her again

  as i passed the young ladies dormi-
tory that night i saw a light in the par-
lor and knew she was sitting up until all
of the girls were home from the dance
it was her custom i glanced in the win-
dow and discovered her alone in the
parlor-and she was crying i thought
possibly harris had hurt her feelings in
some way-so i went in to see about it
when i spoke i was afraid of what
might happen but i hoped she might
have forgiven me she looked up her
eyes burning with anger i felt my whole
system groan there i was with the
necessary money but in getting the
money i had lost the young woman of my
choice i suddenly saw too that miss
nettie was the only young lady of my
choice-no matter how many of them
should see me blush while ordering un-
der-garments

  weak overpowered i turned to go
but she called me she was smiling
tearful but smiling then she sprang
to her feet i walked-ah that is-ran 
toward her

  it is quite true about that group of co- j
eds coming in half an hour later they
did find us-ah-well in a close embrace

  that is all there is to the story what
the curious psychological phenomenon j
which occurred in my own conscious- m
ness oh yes why-uh the fact is i
have discovered since that evening-
upon a careful reflection-that the thing
known as a prizefight has a real attraction
to a man i recall that it thrilled me it
actually gave me pleasure
 the beat

by harriet lummis smith

	tt was the noisiest hour of the noisy
      twenty-four within the throbbing

  i of the presses outside the shouting
i and whistling of waiting news boys

alicia seated at her typewriter tried vain-
 ly to recall what she had wished to say
she had been assigned to report a union
missionary meeting at one of the local
churches and was now in process of
compressing her painstaking notes into
five newspaper lines she had been ac-
customed all her life to country quiet
 sometimes she seemed to hersel f drown-
ing in an ocean of incongruous sounds
sinking in spite of her efforts to keep
afloat

   as she stared vacantly at the typewriter
keys the inevitable question came to add
to the confusion of her thoughts was
she on the right path or the wrong as
to her goal alicia never doubted all
her misgivings had to do with method
but when to a literary ambition is added
m necessity of earning a livelihood the
sum is journalism nine times out of ten
dully alicia wondered how her work of
the afternoon was to help her in the
realization of her dream wtiat was
there in this existence of turmoil and
haste of confused thought and trivial
work to serve as a training school for
embodying in words and phrases the pas-
sionate pulsing splendid thing she called
life she looked at her notes on the
missionary meeting with sudden loath-
ing

  miss byrd came into the room with a
ropy of the evening edition in her hand
o fresh from the press that the ink
smudged as she turned the sheet she
fya a thin middle-aged woman who
had left her ambitions so far behind that
she had almost forgotten them but as
the comfort of life is not in proportion
 to its ambition but rather the reverse
fl wiss byrd found the existence of a



newspaper hack far from intolerable
her superiors knew her value for at a
pinch she could take the place of the dra-
matic critic fill up the columns of the
book reviews pass judgment on the ex-
hibit of the local artists club or on the
womans page pose as an authority on
fashions and give advice to mothers on
the care of teething infants a useful
woman was miss bvrd and not the least
valuable of her activities was the assist-
ance she gave to bewildered beginners
struggling like alicia to find themselves

  for all her undeniable competency
miss byrd represented to alicia all she
most dreaded to become gray-haired
and always a little disheveled compla-
cently content increasingly narrow
shall i ever be like that was in
alicias thoughts as she looked up and
then she forgot the question in a surprise
that possessed an element of pleasure
for on the damp page of the paper just
off the press was a face she knew

  why thats sue kirby alicia
leaned forward for a closer inspection
miss byrd smiled the smile of untold
superiority

  guess again my child this lady is
mrs penrose pickering and one of the
most talked-of women in the city you
dont mean that you havent read-

  excitement betrayed alicia into the
impropriety of interrupting the oracle
mrs penrose pickering why of
course i remember now she married a
pickering but i never think of her as
anything but sue kirby she came
back with a start to miss byrds unfin-
ished question to be sure ive read
about her i just didnt realize she was
sue

  the face of the veteran changed oddly
she came nearer extending the sheet
from which the pictured face smiled un-


breezy stories

abashed on all the world you really
think-

  why certainly i know her before
she was married she was sue kirby
she was a neighbor of ours up in the
country shes a little older than i am
but ive known her all my life alidads
tone betrayed exasperation miss byrd
knew more than she did about newspa-
per reporting she was willing to admit
that but as far as sue kirby was con-
cerned she would not give an inch

  and are you two friendly

  the eagerness in miss byrds voice
meant something but the necessity of
replying gave alicia no time to solve the
puzzle

  why she was a great friend of my
older sister when they were children
and the last time sue was home-that
must be almost four years ago-she
begged me to make her a visit but i
never did and afterward we heard-
or anyway people said-

  i see i see the fingers of the older
woman closed tightly on alicias arm
do you think she would see you now 
sue kirby why of course

  my dear is it possible you dont get
on to the importance of this of course
you remember the circumstances of san-
fields suicide bernard sanfield you
know the big wheat speculator why
the papers were full of it

  yes i remember-at least i think i
do so many people kill themselves
miss byrd drew a long breath sug-
gestive of a prayer for patience

  this was an extraordinary case he
was only a little over forty and rich and
his wife didnt interfere with his enjoy-
ments shes a meek little thing i be-
lieve she didnt know about his acquaint-
ance with mrs pickering and refused to
believe there was any harm in it even
when the whole story came out after his
death she lived in the country and
brought up the children and he went up
to see her now and then there was no
earthly reason why he should kill him-
self as far as his wife and his friends
know-unless mrs pickering was in the
secret

  but hadnt he lost a son it seems
to me i remember-

  my dear child yes his son was
drowned about six months before the fa-
thers suicide but you cant suppose that
was the explanation men dont kill
themselves for that sort of thing and
besides there were other children and
as i said he ran up and spent sunday
with his family once in two weeks or so
and that was all he saw of them nr
there was another reason and the
chances are that mrs penrose pickering
knows it

  alicia made no comment but the
vagueness of her mood had passed she
listened breathlessly

  you know shes shut herself up in the
house since he died and lives like a nun
nobodys admitted newspaper people
least of all but if an old friend should
get access to her she might talk if you
could manage it it would be the making
of you a sudden harshness sounded
in her voice oh if id had such a
chance when i was your age

  you think its really a chance

  if youve got imagination and insight
and the other necessary things that story
will show it you cant use your imagi-
nation on stuff like that- she tapped
the notes of the missionary meeting with
contemptuous fingers and by the time
your chance comes youve lost what the
gods gave you and all thats left is to go
on grinding out copy to the end of your
days she looked into the girls eyes
an unwonted gleam in her own if you
believe in prayer pray that shell see you
and that shell talk if you make a fail-
ure after that you deserve to fail

  oh thank you breathed alicia with
less irrelevance than appears she was
in reality giving thanks for this glimpse
into the heart of her fellow worker and
for the implication all the more splendid
because of its vagueness that success
might be within reach her virile young
fingers pressed her advisers hand
when shall i try it

  to-morrow ill talk with mr hall 
and well decide on the best way of get- 
ting her to open up of course you may
never get inside the door but for two i
months she hasnt seen a soul and ive a
hunch that shell be glad of a glimpse of
a familiar face oh its fairly ridiculous
	the



j that such a piece of luck should have
 come to a kid like you

in spite of the frank envy of one who
hitherto had been rather unpleasantly su-
sperior alicias sensations the next after-
j noon were those of an impostor she
was not to inform mrs pickering that
 she was now a fellow townsman but was
to give her the impression that she had
come down from the country for a few
days of shopping and sight-seeing she
was to tell the news from home and talk

	about old times till her hostess gave signs
of waxing confidential and then she
j was to wait for the story

   you can have all the time you need
 miss byrd had said as she and hall had
 outlined the plan of campaign if you

	dont get it out of her before you have to
leave get an invitation to come again
 she may ask you to stay with her and if
i she does accept-unless you know it all
 already

   the house occupied by mrs penrose
pickering stood in a locality given over
to apartment buildings and the mere fact
of its occupying an individual lot gave it
an air of opulence its shuttered win-
dows were forbidding it looked unoc-
cupied alicia recognized the possibility
that the newspapers were wrong and
that mrs pickering was away and
turned sick with foreboding her very
dreams of the previous night had been
irradiated by dazzling possibilities the
dejection which had been growing on her
for weeks the almost certainty that she
had taken the wrong turning were dissi-
pated as by a miracle a start was all
she wanted and a start was what sue
kirby could give her from that she
saw the way straight to her goal

   the servant who opened mrs picker-
ings door was as forbidding as the shut-
tered windows in answer to her timid
question he replied in a tone of finality
that mrs pickering was seeing no one

i think she will see me her year of
newspaper work had developed alicias
effrontery to the extent of standing her
ground im an old friend a girlhood
friend tell mrs pickering that alicia

i	kent is here

her positiveness had its effect the
man admitted her though sulkily showed

beat	

her to the drawing-room and left her
alicia looked curiously upon the ele-
gance suggested rather than seen in the
dim light and remembered sue kirby
borrowing a piece of black court-plaster
to cover a hole in the toe of her shoej
and she had laughed too as she had
stuck it in place every tooth in her head
showing something in the incongruous
recollection brought the tears stinging to
alicias eyes

  the servant returned with an air of in-
creased respect which told her even be-
fore he spoke that she had won

  mrs pickering will see you upstairs
if youll come this way miss all his
insolence had vanished replaced by the
servile deference of the man who knows
on which side his bread is buttered

  the occupant of the luxurious boudoir
lifting heavy eyes at alicas approach
was strangely unlike the sue kirby she
had known and still less did she suggest
the insolent beauty who had swept san-
field off his feet two months of pas-
sionate grieving had left their trace
more significant than all else her hair
showed brown at the roots the hurt
was deep enough to have rendered her
indifferent to her appearance which with
a woman of her calibre is the final word
in wretchedness

  her dull gaze appraised her caller be-
fore a word was said then she spoke
wearily its little alicia i didnt
want to see you or anybody else but i
couldnt turn away a visitor from home
sit down alicia youve grown pretty
and youve got a sort of style about you
you dont look like a country girl and
then as alicias color flamed she added
indifferently except when you blush
im afraid youre not well sue
alicia said timidly there was some-
thing terrifying in the aspect of this sul-
len suffering creature she was like a
wounded tigress the girl thought and
found the comparison inadequate for
after all the brute could only know the
pang of physical pain

   me  xo im sick unto death the
dignified phrase was strange upon her
lips youve heard about it havent
you 

  heard about what 
	breezy

  to alicias own ears her tone was far
from convincing but mrs pickering
answered with a laugh a sound cu-
riously harsh and rasping

  of course you havent or you
wouldnt be here queer little burg

den falls you folks up there are sort
of fenced off from the world you
might as well live on-what dye call it
-mars for all you know about whats
happening how is everybody

  alicia began a detailed answer to the
question her letters from home and a
copy of the weekly newspaper kept her
weil posted occasionally her listener
interrupted

  what sandy mcneal living yet
lord i supposed the old man had
cashed in ages ago then after a min-
ute and so marie did get married at
last well they say if you try long
enough and hard enough youll win out
in the end she spoke unsmilingly a
sombre fire in the depths of her tragic
eyes

  alicia true to her role of girlish sim-
plicity was describing the rummage sale
given at the methodist church when sue
interrupted listen alicia cant you
stay to dinner with me 

  she made a pretense of reflection
why i suppose-if youre sure it
wouldnt be inconvenient

  hardly i havent spoken to a soul
but these infernal scared sneaking ser-
vants for two months now youre re-
freshing youre like spring water
wasnt there some guy in the bible who
wanted water from the well where he
used to drink when he was a boy 

  i suppose you mean david alicia
allowed a note of shocked reproof to
creep into her voice

  well i guess that was one thing that
ailed me sue took a cigarette from a
case on the table near her and lighted it
you dont mind do you she asked
between the pufts

  no-o but do you think its good for
you sue when youre so nervous
alicia felt that she was realizing the
histrionic possibilities of her role of
guileless country maid in a most gratify-
ing fashion

  it may not be good for me i should

stories

go mad without it but im not sure that
madness isnt the best way out

  oh sue

  youre only a kid alicia a country
kid at that and you dont know what
youre talking about the impulse to
confidence which the astute miss byrd
had foreseen had come upon her  lost
a friend two months ago my best friend
my only friend

  oh hesitated alicia you mean-
  he-he died

  oh sue your husband

  mrs pickering blew a ring of cigarettc
smoke toward the ceiling and watched it
break before she replied

  my husband is probably kicking
around the world somewhere i dont
know whether hes dead or alive and i
dont care

  oh sue alicias recoil was not
assumed again she felt that curious
irrational fear

  this was my friend look she i
drew from her bosom a locket suspended 
by a slender gold chain and pressing the 
spring held the miniature toward alicia
the girl was breathing fast as she leaned 
forward to examine the pictured face

  ties-oh hes very handsome sue 
but-

  she broke off her intended homily
sues face looking down on the minia-
ture changed beyond belief softened
miraculously took on the pitiful beauty
of a madonna dolorosa tears trembled
in her eyes she put the painted face
against her cheek and sat motionless for
a long moment while alicia looked away
her own eyes were brimming

  we were so happy we loved each
other so he was different from other
men-so different most of them are
half brute-when theyre not all brute
but bernard and i- she broke off
abruptly oh god she said and ris-
ing began to pace the floor alicia
watched with dilated eyes

  some minutes passed before sue spoke
again and then she whispered h
killed himself she said

  alicias start was not assumed the
details of the tragedy as miss byrd had
reviewed them for her benefit had passed
from her mind this bleeding quivering
the beat



anguish seemed infinitely removed from
the cheap notoriety of the newspaper ac-

	count

    -oh poor sue she sobbed and al-
 most liated herself for her tears

    yes he killed himself some people
thought he and i had quarreled fools
we never quarreled  would have torn
 my heart out ofmy body for him if hed
i said the word there was nothing i
 wouldnt have done of course he didnt
 love me like that-no man ever does he
j wouldnt even ask his wife to divorce
him though i begged for that he
i didnt want to hurt her but he was
heavenly kind always the very last
time he came-no i cant tell you about
that i cant she wept wringing her
hands and alicia wept too-and
waited

then he went home and saw his wife
and family he was married to a wee
 little house-cat of a woman she adored
i him in her way the tabby-cat way al-

	ways purred when he stroked her and
 then when he went away curled up in a
ball and went to sleep that kind but
 he was fond of her and he worshipped
his children
j alicia catching sight of her own intent
face in one of the numerous mirrors
saw it deadly pale the blended odors
of the cigarette smoke and of some heavy
perfume closed in upon her suffocatingly
the white face in the glass blurred gro-
tesquely

i mustnt faint thought the girl
 shes coming to it i mustnt faint
she steadied herself with a supreme ef-
fort sues voice reached her distinct
but seemingly distant

   then he went hunting as they
 thought and he was found in the lodge
 dead the second morning it was poi-

i	son people would hardly believe it at
 first the people who knew him i mean
 he loved life so nine-tenths of the men
 you see go to their business looking as if
 theyd just been sentenced to a term in
 sing sing bernard went as if it were a

 game always smiling and sure even
n when he lost he laughed and after he

ii	knew me- oh ctied the poor crea-
i ture her voice breaking we were so
f happy

  perhaps suggested alicia with dry
lips he took it by mistake

  mistake oh no it was deliber-
ate she put her hand to her forehead
a little confusedly i havent told you
yet about the boy

  alicia said nothing

  he was the oldest one you know
named for him we used to talk about
him a great deal he was as bright as a
dollar theyd always had tutovs for
him and at the rate he was forging ahead
hed have been ready for college at sev-
enteen he was only fourteen when he
-he died

  hand gripping hand till the fingers left
purple dents in the flesh alicia listened

  somehow he got on to the fact of his
fathers acquaintance with me bernard
thought afterward that perhaps he had
sent him to his desk for some papers
and hed come across a note from me
it doesnt seem as if anybody could have
told a child a thing like that he must
have found it out himself some way
she seemed to be asking alicias opin-
ion i-i suppose so the girl said in a
strained voice

  anyway he had the address all right
and he came here his father was with
me you understand wed finished
luncheon and come up to this room and
my man-i discharged him the next day
-brought up word that a boy was at
the door with a message for mr sanfield
we took it for granted that it was a
messenger boy they had to know
where to find him you see when the
market was up and down and bernard
said to send the boy upstairs i saw him
first and i knew him though id never
set eves on him before he was a hand-
some little fellow but he looked older
than fourteen because hed read so
much i suppose

  she was talking rapidly and monoto-
nously it was plain that the confidence
was proving an enormous relief it was
not necessary to bait the hook the fish
leaped at it bare

 he just stood there looking his eyes
big and round and his face white his
father had his back toward him and
after a minute he said rather sharp
well boy and then he turned around
breezy stories



my god i can see his face now he
got up trying to be angry what does
this mean sir  he said but t was all put
on he was frightened like a bad boy
in school called up to the masters desk
and that was what frightened me the
look of fear on his face

  she was silent a little as if she did in
truth see the face of her dead lover
transformed by fear and shame

  the boy spoke out at last he had a
little boys voice you know all treble it
didnt seem to fit with that dreadfully
wise look on his face youll have to
excuse me father he said i had to
come to see if it was really so and
with that he walked out of the room
bernard started to follow him and he
stopped he felt he couldnt face him
again he didnt tell me but i knew
that was it oh that look that look
do you suppose we go on remembering
millions and millions of years id hate
to think it she caught her breath in a
long sobbing sigh that was the last
time he ever saw the little fellow alive
alicia was by now oblivious to every-
thing but the development of the tragedy
oh no she whispered protestingly

  he was drowned three days later
said mrs pickering hardening her voice
it looked like an accident he went
swimming with a lot of boys and swam
on and on and went under finally in
water fifteen feet deep there wasnt a
thing to show he had planned it except
the letter he wrote to his father he
posted it on the way to the lake all it
said was i dont think i can bear to live
any longer the news of the drowning
came before the letter of course ber-
nard might have borne it if hed only
suspected but after the letter came he
knew and no man could live knowing
that he waited six months to get things
into shape he wanted to arrange every-
thing for me so id be provided for avith-
out any scandal but he couldnt live you
know not with that before him night and
day it was just what the boy had felt
only more so

  she had paced the floor during most of
the recital now she came and stood be-
side alicia looking down on her white
tear-wet face with sympathetic under-

  standing she herself had changed for
  the better since the girls entrance al-
  ready her confidences had eased the
  strain

    you poor kid i dont know what
  ive been thinking of and you fresh

-	from the country you want to go home
  and forget it alicia forget that such
  things happen her arm slipped about
  the girls tense body drawing her close
  but its been good to talk to somebody
  from home

     it was nine in the evening when alicia
  stepped into the limousine and gave the
  number of her boarding house to the
  driver she had dined amid unwonted
  magnificence she had told the latest
  news regarding the majority of the in-
  habitants of glen falls when she was
  ready to go mrs pickering followed her
  into the hall

     sure you havent time to come out to
  see me again

     im afraid not sue

    well its been good to have tins
  glimpse of you she put her white
  jeweled hands on alicias shoulder
  you dont mind she asked before she
  kissed her and then  its been good
  so good to talk to somebody from home
  at half-past nine the limousine de-
  posited alicia at her own door and
  glided away alicia who had made a
  pretense of fumbling for her latch-key
  only waited for it to turn the corner and
  then shot down the steps and to the near-
  est car line in strange revulsion from
  her earlier mood of sympathetic horror
  she was wildly exultant what a story
  she had throbbing with life the red
  blood pulsing through it from beginning
  to end she had solved the mystery that
  had puzzled the great city and had
  thwarted the bloodhounds of the press

  it was all luck but it meant the saving
  of years out of her life miss byrd was
  right in the mechanical monotonous
  work of the average reporter one with-
  ered and dried up thanks to generous j
  fortune she would make her mark at
  the very beginning of her career and
  henceforth would be trusted to under-
  take work needing a finer touch as she
  boarded the car she stifled a hysterical
  impulse to laugh aloud
blue ix the sky

c

  suddenly she seemed to feel sue kir-
bys hands on her shoulders and hear
sues voice saying its been good so
good to talk to somebody from home
to sue she would seem a judas the
woman had poured out her heart not
to alicia kent but to an abstraction that
stood for friendliness and old times and
home and alicia kent profiting there-
by had transformed that confidence
into coin something concerning thirty
pieces of silver came vaguely to her
thoughts

  look here said alicia to herself
ive got to be sensible she summoned
to her aid her store of worldly wisdom
chiefly accumulated during her few
months in the great city its not ex-
actly a nice thing to do but in this world
you cant be too particular i cant give
up my chances for the future in order to
spare the feelings of sue kirby

  fare please shouted the conductor
in the angry tone of one whose appeals
have been disregarded alicia gave him
a quarter and allowed him to force the
change into her passive hand

  sue kirby would look upon her as a
traitor no one else would know and
it was unlikely that she would ever see
sue kirby again it was fantastic to
contemplate such a thing a the possible
sacrifice of her lifes success for the sake

of a woman the self-confessed mistress
of a suicide she had no right to expect
anything from anybody such people
forfeit consideration alicia thought vir-
tuously

  its been good so good to talk to
somebody from home it was strange
how those words haunted her mrs
penrose pickering in spite of her mode
of life had some illusions left she
still believed in the home folks in their
honor and good faith after to-morrow
that would be in ruins along with the
rest-her dreams of love and happiness
her girlhood innocence

  why gasped alicia suddenly white
to the lips she never even asked me
not to tell

  she had passed the newspaper office
by a block she rang the bell alighted
and plodded back in the face of a sharp
wind the odor of printers ink met her
on the sidewalk within she heard the
familiar roar and clicking hurrying
men passed her some going some com-
ing some nodding greetings others
rushing past absorbed in their errand

  miss byrd seated at the typewriter
started to her feet as alicia entered
her bright eyes scanned the girls face
uncertainly well what did you get
out of her

  nothing said alicia

blue in the sky

 by o c a child

 blue in the sky i used to long for it

watch for it care for it scarce knowing why
ah days go by now ive no song for it

what does it matter now blue in the sky 

breeze from the sea how once i yearned for it
blowing so sweet from the waves oer the lea
cool to my soul once how i burned for it

what does it matter now breeze from the sea

blue in the sky-oil im too old for it

 c loud-cast or rain-swept is all one to me

 clear blows the breeze but im too cold for it
 what docs it matter now breeze from the sea
only a husband

by carrie louisa shaw


this tale points no moral unless it be hire a careful chauffeur

like innumerable beetles the
cars on fifth avenue crawled
along halted with maddening
frequency by the stop signs of
traffic policemen within a limousine
edward madigan rising power in things
theatrical sat in tense impatience

  at last he snapped through the tube
turn over to broadway frank and get
out of this- and in obeying these in-
structions the overly-eager frank round-
ing a corner abruptly grazed the gown
of a girl who was crossing the street with
absent eyes on the ground frightened
she jumped stumbled and fell madigan
pushed his way through the crowd that
had instantly collected and began apolo
gies but the girl already upon her feet
laughed nervously and brushed her shab-
by skirt

  oh its nothing im not hurt she
protested and started away

  but madigan detained her please
let me take you to wherever youre go-
ing he said and hesitating a moment
the girl followed him accepting the most
speedy means of leaving the curious
crowd behind

  as they glided away he looked at her
more closely though his practiced eye
had instantly appraised her as beautiful
now he decided that her loveliness was
chiefly in expression a look of sweet
and womanly tenderness just the sort
of girl he told himself who loved all
children and cried over abused animals

  i am edward madigan he quickly
recalled himself wondering if the name
would mean anything to her

  oh really  was the radiant re-
sponse  why ive been trying to see
your director all week about an en-
gagement she explained i want to go
on the stage and i heard you were put-
ting on a new musical piece

  im on my way to a rehearsal now
come with me and ill put you with the
show he offered impulsively

  the thank you of the girls soft eyes
was a reward

  for two months claire witchie the
girl danced with six chosen beauties in
the chorus of the pink stocking
then one morning at an understudy re-
hearsal she showed signs of dramatic
ability and madigan surprised everyone
by assigning her to one of the lesser
roles in the company he engaged a
famous director to work with her each
day to aid in smoothing off rough edges
and her progress was encouraging

  a few weeks later she attained a part
next in importance to the stars due to
an actress altercation with the manage-
ment they were patient with her first
nervous performances and soon she re-
warded them by making good in a far
greater degree than her predecessor
madigan began taking her out to restaur-
ants and broadway munched its latest
tidbit of scandal

  claire grew quite bold she called
him eddie and old dear at re-
hearsals and she joined the seventy
club and appeared in imported gowns
her professional associates accorded her
the respect that the tenderloin offers to
ladies who conduct their affairs in high
circles for the leading lady of the
pink stocking company would have or-
dered her removal instantly had claire -
remained in the chorus and flaunted a
vulgar flirtation with the property man

  however it proved more than a sky-
rocket love affair for one day the
morning telegraph printed in big type
the romance of their wedding later it
was announced that mrs madigan
would rest while a suitable vehicle was


only a husband



being found for her and claire lounged
in the sumptuous apartment of her man-
ager-husband while he searched dili-
gently for said vehicle claire was still
her sweet tender self and madigan grew
more enamored as time passed until his
smile as he regarded her seemed almost
fatuous and she apparently returned
his affection at night they read to-
ethcr any hopeful manuscripts but each
eld radically divergent ideas of what
constituted a desirable play

  madigan wanted a combination of
good show and fat stellar role but
claire was on the outlook for nothing
but situations in which she might
shine

  the final result was that she coaxed
her husband into launching a spectacular
musical piece that cost a fortune to pro-
duce but whose book was trite and
whose tunes were tuneless he downed
his fears and hoped for the best and the
show received commendation at its open-
ing in syracuse but at its broadway
ptcmibre the critics sat like solemn owls
throughout the comedy then next day
blazoned its deficiencies to the world
through their respective papers yet all
devoted paragaphs of laudation to the
star claire witchie there was no de-
nying the girls talent and madigan was
balanced between pleasure at his wifes
triumph and deiression because of the
crash for crash it was his own rise
had been meteoric his professional repu-
tation-and money-were gained by one
successful production so that he had
staked practically everything on the ruin-
ous play that made claire a star

  the show was rewritten in spots scenes
added and cut but it grew worse and it
was necessary to close it two weeks after
the opening but claire with a good
press agent was kept constantly in the
public eye and madigan found that as
time passed and her fame increased his
identity somehow became submerged in
hers he began to hear himself spoken
of as claire witchies husband

  there was enough left from the wreck
to make a front of course but his
wifes extravagance was becoming a se-
rious factor to reckon with lie steeled
himself to explain his financial status and

asked her cooperation in a half-ashamed
way she was astonished and a little
hurt

  why edward i had no idea you
were so poor she said in a sweet ag-
grieved way

  after all poverty is relative once a
very short time back he had looked
upon her little seventy-five-dollar savings
account as real wealth now she paid
that infinitesimal sum for a negligee

  offers from other managers came to
her but madigan too proud to acknowl-
edge final failure urged her to wait and
she had observ ed his wishes with martyr-
like grace he began pottering in smaller
things but a stubbornly malignant fate
turned everything to ashes in his hands
and soon he was identified with so many
small failures that his superstitious pro-
fession closed its doors to him he had
not been at the top long enough to have
obtained a real hold nor inspired staunch
followers

  his wife was very gentle very patient
with him secretly she wondered if he
had wasted herself in marrying him
he had given her the big chance of
course but who was it said that about
if you do anything better than your fel-
lowmen the world will beat a path to
your door even if it be in the wilder-
ness of course not taking into con-
sideration that the theatre is possibly the
one exception where opportunity is the
fairy godmother claire witchie might
have been a chorus girl till the end if
madigan had not hit her with his ma-
chine his absent eye might never have
singled her out from his other choristers
even had she been chosen by the stage
director who did the picking of girls
which is not at all likely claire in the
beginning was too raw too awkward to
appeal to a seasoned director no say
what you will crossing the street with
eyes to the ground had been her psycho-
logical moment

  when he could hold on no longer he
advised claire to accept an offer the
contract for which she had signed two
days before she was vastly relieved
that this made any awkward news-break-
ing unnecessary on her part

  perhaps i can get you in as the busi-


breezy stories

ness manager in fact fm sure i can
she told him kindly

  no thanks dont bother he had
returned with grim politeness

  there followed weeks of rehearsals
then a week out of town for claire
madlgan accompanied her and watched
and criticized her every performance
in the past she had always been eager
and grateful for his suggestions but
now she seemed resentful of anything
he said unless it was praise of her work
at the new york debut he sat far back
in the gallery unwilling to occupy the
box claire had reserved and so be a
cynosure for those who would point him
out as the stars husband before the
second act was over he knew that the
show had caught on he hurried back
stage after the final curtain he was
to take claire out to supper and for the
moment depression fled and he was pal-
pitating with joy at her success and an-
ticipation of the pleasure they would
find in talking of it

  but in her dressing room claire faced
him with a guilty little smile

  oh eddie bad news she said
ive got to go out with allison and some
of his tribe i dread it but i dont see
how i can escape very well do you
they didnt say anything about your
coming along and i hated to-

  of course lie cut her off hoping the
terrible hurt did not show in his eyes
it wouldnt be good policy to refuse
and anyway im tired to-night

  he went on to tell her something of his
pleasure in what seemed her assured suc-
cess but she appeared indifferent and
several times interrupted with instruc-
tions to the maid

  he left her and returned to the apart-
ment to wait for her things were
clearly figured out in his mind before
she entered three hours later

  claire he began scarcely givingher
time to remove her hat can you see that
weve reached a crisis

  she considered a minute

  yes t can was her frank answer

  im about down and oul he con-
tinued and youre soaring to the top

we dont make a congruous team do

we 

  i knew you would look at things like
that and i think youre a foolish boy
she scoffed but her tone was not con-
vincing

  i wont live on your salary he stated
bluntly

  i suppose theres no use arguing if
youre going to take that stand there
was genuine relief in her voice frank-
ly eddie i admire you for your pride
even while i want you to share with me
but i dont want to kill your self-re-
spect by urging you to stay on here

  madigan was a little startled in his
somewhat vague plans for independence
he had not thought of leaving the apart-
ment that had been his home for four
years

  dont you want the car too he in-
quired with dry humor

  why yes ill borrow it for a time
anyway at least until youre on your
feet she said seriously

  that will put me on my feet lie
punned then youre tired now so
well talk over everything in the morn-
ing

  but when morning came he tip-toed
about and packed very quietly and was
established in a cheap forty-seventh
street hotel three hours before she called
for her chocolate

  about noon he strolled up a cross
street in search of a reasonable res-
taurant reaching fifth avenue with no
success the swarming cars made cross-
ing look impossible but madigan not
waiting for an official halting of the line
dodged dexterously among them he
had nearly reached the other side in
safety when a long gray car bumped him
gently from behind

   lie turned wrath fully as it slid silently
by within and sweetly unconscious
of his ignominy sat claire witchie his
wife

  suddenly he began laughing so heart-
ily that people turned to stare at him
much lie had lost but out of the wreck
he had saved his sense of humor
beautiful bertie



any rate said mrs van camp and
i will provide you with carte blanche

  and she patted berties lily-white
fingers with her own diamond-incrusted
ones

  the motor stopped they were be-
fore a handsome residence on the ipper
west side the footman opened the
door of the car and bertie got out and
assisted queen victoria to alight she
took his arm and gave it a squeeze he
tingled all over and felt like screaming
aloud-for joy of course

  the footman had rung the door bell
and another footman had opened the
door bertie and mrs van camp en-
tered the house it was stuffy and
frumpy everything was very old-fash-
ioned and appropriately early victor-
ian but an atmosphere of affluence
pervaded the whole abode

  this is the drawing-room said mrs
van camp showing bertie the apart-
ment and this is the dining-room
and now let us go upstairs

  a maid relieved her of the ermine
cloak and the purple bonnet bertie was
afraid she would also be relieved of her
titian wig for it became entangled in
the hat

  mrs van camp led the way to the
upper floor

  this is the living-room said the old
lady and this is my boudoir as you
see the whole house needs going over
i have realized this for some time past
but have let things wait-till now some-
how as i passed the minty shop to-
day i finally made up my mind some-
thing impelled me i am very psychic
i have intuitions and they are never
wrong i have had an intuition about
you too and i am sure we are going
to be congenial and sympathetic

  i hope so said bertie i hope so
-with all my heart

  they talked for a while about intui-
tions and chairs premonitions and tables
personalities and bric-a-brac and at
last bertie tore himself away but the
next day he returned and the next
and the next

  in fact after that he paid daily visits
to irs van camp and then nightly
visits as well he took samples of bro-

cade and specimens of wood he was
heart and soul in the work of decorating
mrs van camps house and of making
a hit with the old lady herself

  there was to be a black and white
drawing-room to please mr mcgilli-
enddy and a green and blue dining-room
to please mr fitzhuskinson and a pale
pink boudoir to please mrs van camp
bertie confined his own preferences to
the guestroom which was to be gold and
purple

  slowly but surely the interior of the
old ladys dwelling changed its appear-
ance mr mcgillicuddy gushed over
the black and white drawing-room mr
fitzhuskinson gurgled over the green
and blue dining-room mrs van camp
gloated over the pale pink boudoir and
bertie clasped ins hands and rolled his
eyes over the gold and purple guest-
room

  oh to sit in those gold and purple
chairs piped bertie and oh to sleep
in that gold and purple bedstead 

  well said mrs van camp why
not

  dearest lady cried bertie what-
ever do you mean

  t have told you that i am lonely and
you have told me that you are lonely
said mrs van cam two negatives
make an affirmative why not come
here and live 

 my gawd cried bertie am i
awake or asleep

  awake-i hope said the old lady

	so bertie moved out of his hall bed-
room in a cheap boarding house and
moved into the gold and purple guest-
chamber in mrs van camps mansion on
the upper west side and at the same
time he resigned from his position at
the minty shop he had become
private secretary to mrs van camp

  and then one day he reappeared amid
the brass candlesticks and copper bowls
he wore a brown suit and a brown over-
coat a brown necktie and a brown hat
he was in fact a brown study

  girlssaid bertie i have come to
pay my bill

  your bill cried gertrude what

breezy stories

bookcase painted he had waited on a
woman who wanted a sofa upholstered
and he had waited on a woman who
wanted a bed canopied

  none of these customers and none of
these commissions had interested him
in the least indeed he had repeatedly
lifted his lily-white fingers to his rosy-
red lips in futile efforts to conceal ter-
rific yawns with one hand on his hip
and one hand on his chest he had mani-
fested every evidence of boredom

  but then all of a sudden a great
commotion occurred in the aesthetic sales-
room

  mercy piped mr mcgillicuddy a
motor has drawn up at the curb

  true breathed mr fitzhuskinson
and queen victoria is alighting

  and as a matter of fact the old lady
 who stepped out of the car and walked
 into the shop was not at all unlike king
 georges grandmother in personal ap-
 pearance if not in sartorial embellish-
 ment

  she was short and stout but over
her hair she had drawn a red wig and
around her portly figure she had draped
an ermine cloak in her ears were dia-
mond pendants and on her fingers were
diamond rings

  mr mcgillicuddy minced forward

  good day madam said gertrude

  the old lady ignored him entirely

  mr fitzhuskinson slid along

  what can i do for you madam
said eva

  the old lady looked straight through
him

  bertie willowed into view

  at your service madam said ber-
tie

  ah said the old lady i want you
to wait on me

  bertie smiled his sweetest but ger-
trude and eva frowned their deadliest
and with arched eyebrows and pursed
lips moved away leaving bertie to the
old lady and the old lady to bertie

  ts that ermine whispered gertrude
 or rabbit skin 

  and are those diamonds whispered
eva or cracked ice

  i want my whole house redecorated
said the old lady and i want you to

offer suggestions my automobile is
waiting outside can you come home
with me now and have a look around

  i have an appointment r half an
hour with the princess pompom said
bertie but perhaps it can be postponed

i will inquire and see

  he wriggled away and went over to
where the manager and the assistant
manager were dishing dirt and knock-
ing everybody

  she wants me to go home with her
gasped bertie i am to decorate her
house from cellar to garret can i go

  of course said jvir mcgillicuddy

  what luck said mr fitzhuskinson

  so bertie put on his soft gray hat and
his loose blue coat and his clean white
gloves and swept out of the minty
shop with queen victoria the foot-
man opened the door of the automobile
and the strange pair stepped inside

  my name is mrs van camp said
the old lady

  and mine is bertram le drag said
bertie

  how old are you said mrs van-
camp

  just twenty said bertie

  young enough to be my son said
mrs van camp

  oh i dont think so really said
bertie who had expected her to say
grandson instead

  i live a very lonely life said mrs
van camp

  so do i said bertie

  i have no family of my own said
mrs van camp

  my case exactly said bertie

  no one to love and to cherish said
mrs van camp no one to provide
for and leave my money to

  ah what a difference said bertie
i work so hard for a living matching
colors choosr stuffs basting hems
and hammerin acks i who love books
and pictures and music and life i
should have plenty of wealth at my
command because i adore beauty and
refinement culture and magnificence
but since t cannot possess these glorious
things myself it consoles me to put them
into the homes of others

  you must put them into my home at
beautiful bertie -

his start and his finish
by harold sustnan

bertie had been a beautiful
baby and a beautiful boy before
becoming a beautiful youth
his cheeks bad always been very
pink and his eyes had always been very
bine his hair had always been very yel-
low and his lips had always been very
red and he had always been a perfect
sissy

  as a child the other children had
thrown sticks and stones at him and as
a lad the other lads had hurled insulting
remarks at him he had been nicknamed
many things including gladys and beat-
rice but the name that stuck the stead-
iest was beautiful bertie

  when he was sixteen he left school
and got a job the girls told him that
he was too pretty to work and he
agreed with them entirely but he had
to be self-supporting he started in at
a soda fountain he learned how to
make egg phosphates and nut sundaes

  later on he worked for a milliner
he learned how to wire shapes and
stitch trimming and at last he got a
position as salesman with a firm of in-
terior decorators

  this final employment proved to be
the most congenial of all at the soda
fountain the other fellows had splashed
him with syrup and made fun of his
walk at the milliners the girls had
jabbed him with needles and mimicked
his talk but at the interior decorators
nobody annoyed him in any way at all

  people in glass houses shouldnt throw
stones and the manager mr mcgilli-
cuddv had long been known as ger-
trude while the assistant manager mr
fitzhuskinson had long been known as
eva the first-named used much face-
powder and the last-named used much
perfume

  it was as good as a show to enter the

minty shop it was filled with chairs
and tables and sofas and beds uphol-
stered in black and white or green and
blue black and white was mr mcgilli-
cuddys favorite scheme and green and
blue was mr fitzhuskinsons

  there were wicker cages containing
stuffed parrots and velvet cushions em-
broidered with spangles there were
silks and satins and brass candlesticks
and copper bowls there were mirrored
screens and tripod incense-burners and
last but not least there were gertrude
eva and beautiful bertie

  my dear mr mcgillicuddy would
lisp isnt this silk simply superb
without a doubt mr fitzhuskinson
would gasp but isnt this satin per-
fectly delicious 

  my gawd bertie would gurgle
isnt this velvet absolutely distracting
and while the manager would throw
the silken scarf over his arm and while
the assistant manager would drape the
satin strip over his shoulder the sales-
man would trail the velvet curtain along
the ground

  many people went into the minty
shop merely to make fun of the indi-
viduals in charge but many more went

     by barbara saw telle

no one was more surprised than
paul benton the banker and
art lover when he found him-
self motoring with his friend
darrow to faverly farms connecticut
to attend the wedding of a girl whom he
had never seen

  curiosity played a latent though im-
portant part in his decision to accompany
darrow also for his friend had made
the cryptic remark that it was pretty
white in thorley yenner to marry amy
collamore and benton had a desire to
see a woman that was black enough to
make thorley yenner look white by con-
trast

  arriving at the collamore house ben-
ton was quite relieved to find darrow
greeted as an old family friend while
his own base intrusion as he chose to call
it was lost in the welcome of mrs col-
krore herself

  benton found amy collamore charm-
ing not because she was a bride in be-
coming attire but because she towered
mentally so high above venner himself
in every act and word even in the short
conversation with her at the reception
he could not fail to admire her evenly-
pitched voice her select choice of words
the tender pleading brown eyes and sen-
sitive mouth

  mrs collamore beamed upon her child
serenely there was an unusual ex-
pression of satisfaction upon her face
which bespoke relief benton accounted
for this contentment when in passing
two ladies returning from the dining-
room he heard one whisper to the other
it will be three months before dick
balsh will get the news way out in in-
dia i wonder what he will say

  he will be very much relieved you
may depend upon it

  then benton wondered in a vague
sort of way just why dick balsh should

be relieved why he went to india who
he was anyway and if his name bore
any relation to yenners being termed
white

  while meditating thus it occurred to
him that darrow had also mentioned
that the girl was from one of the best
families in the state it seemed incredi-
ble that a fellow with yenners reputa-
tion evident lack of education as well as
family should be able to marry a girl
like that and he spoke of it to darrow

  oh thorleys all right remarked
darrow he is like the woman who
could not afford an orchid at the hot-
house so picked one from the gutter it
was an orchid after all and she didnt
care who had worn it before so long as
it became her

  benton frowned girl been married
before

  hardly darrow answered shrugged
his shoulders and smiling knowingly
lighted a cigarette

  the one and only reason why benton
had accepted darrows invitation to the
wedding was because he had said this
much and no more if there was one
thing benton deplored more than an-
other it was the unnecessary airing of
ones private affairs and there was evi-
dently some reason for the shrug the
smile and the silence in regard to yen-
ners lady

  after the wedding thorley yenner
took his wife to new york and after a
time darrow and benton followed

  in the course of a few months they
called at yenners request and benton
asked permission to look around

  the living-room of the yenners might
have been spoken of as mentally at
variance though the couch with its
deep red pillows the table with its maga-
zines and cigarettes spoke of ease and
comfort the straw standard work-


breezy stories



basket beside il spoke of thrift and in-
dustry though the languorous eyes of
a neapolitan girl gleamed from a can-
vas framed in rich bronze they did not
dim the earnestness of the photograph
of aunt annie ilallet as it reposed prim
and virtuous in an embroidered linen 
frame upon a white enameled table a
quaint shelf contained an array of rare
ivories and cloisonne above which hung
a water-color of apple blossoms against
an insipid blue sky

  benton later came to laugh at this
room it bore out amys moods so well
and he had remarked to darrow and
venner many times that he could not
hatter the room by calling it artistic but
he was compelled to admit that as far as
furnishings went it stood in a class that
might be called unique

 toward the end of the second year
darrow and benton arrived early one
evening for dinner to find amy in ex-
cellent spirits cooking the meal herself
as usual and singing at her work with
accustomed freedom darrow hung his
coat upon the rack and proceeded to fol-
low her into the kitchen kind of hap-
py to-night arent you whats new
amy reached for bentons coat and
hat and insisted upon hanging them up
herself oh the most delightful thing
happened to-day a girl from my own
home town my best friend edith teller
has married and settled down out at
carsdale she has been here a year now
and i met her to-day for the first time
when i was out shopping

  glad to see her werent you ben-
ton was listening to venners latch key

 i should say i was she invited
thorley and me to come out saturday
for a week-end she has some wonder-
ful friends she says-people i have
longed to meet too

  whos that amy venners voice
as he entered sounded strangely dis-
cordant cutting its way through amys
softer tones

  why edith teller i tjiet her to-day
she is married to a lawyer named mat-
terson they have a wonderful house
out in carsdale and she invited us out
for a week-end

  had on your new- furs didnt you

and that smart military hat venner

sneered

  why of course but how can that
matter laughed amy

  your name is amy venner now not
amy collamore you know in spite of
your having a-plenty of this worlds
goods before i married you there was a
year or so when she didnt speak to you
didnt come to your wedding even i
hope you havent forgotten that

  indeed i have thorley

  for some inexplicable reason benton
felt obliged to interrupt just a girls
quarrel i suppose they melt away like
dew

   enner sneered this was no girls
quarrel this was simon-pure mean-
ness on edith tellers part-snobbish-
ness you might call it

  she has some wonderful friends
thorley amy stood flushing and bit-
ing her lips her eyes cast down upon her
work

well havent i look at darrow
and benton arent they good enough 

  oh yes indeed but i meant women
edith says she knows scores of opera
singers authors artists and all of that
kind of people will be delightfully new
to me

  well we dont have to meet them
through edith teller matterson ven-
ner swung his dining-chair into place
come on boys he added sit down

  the same old subjects were discussed
during dinner the same old discontent
of venner and darrow rehearsed the
united states was overcrowded too
many foreigners everybody cutting in
and working for nothing just to get an-
others job away the only country
where a man might have a chance was
mexico what if there was rebellion
there wasnt it everywhere in some
form or another what those people
really needed was american pioneers to
come down and show them how to live
in peace so the talk ran on

  you cant go of course benton
your business keeps you here ex-
plained venner

  you seem to have decided upon go-
ing remarked benton coolly

not quite but why hang around here
her home town



for two hundred dollars when theres
two thousand waiting for a fellow
there 

  it will take some capital to start
ventured benton

  oh well thats easy yenner tossed
the matter aside with a wave of his hand
amys my capital and that makes me
think if we do go theres the solution
to the edith proposition paul you
can take amy out there as often as she
is forgiving enough to want to go per-
sonally he added striking a match i
resent the way she treated amy in
faverly farms for a while but you two
go in for art and artists so go on he
winked toward darrow when we have
gone to mexico

  but amy visited edith matterson long
before yenner visited mexico

  there was a musicale at the carsdale
home and yenner persuaded benton to
take amy promising to join them later
in the evening

  edith matterson had collected around
her just such a set as amy and benton
represented when announced as mrs
yenner and mr benton there was
signor patrici and mrs drake mr ful-
ton and madam ranoul john morvalle
and mrs holden never a mr and mrs
of the same name

  amy wondered at this and laughingly
spoke of h in private to edith

  there arent any mr and mrs
smiths or joneses in new york are
there shall you ever forget how in-
separable those married people were in
connecticut 

  i certainly hope to forget it replied
edith sharply and i also hope you do
not attempt to launch those old-fash-
ioned ideas upon my guests you were
far from a prude amy in our home
town amv face flushed i did not
mean that exactly marriage in new
york makes every connecticut custom
seem-quite different

  you mean suggested edith as she
led the way from the room that mar-
riage in new york makes everything
possible and plausible it has also a
gratifying fashion of obliterating the
past the fashion being regulated of

course by ones popularity and bank

account

  amy took the statement as if it had
been flung at her intentionally whether
in the form of advice or a challenge she
was unable to tell perhaps with
ediths following it would not be a bad
idea to copy her to swing herself by
means of her bank account into that
new york popularity that obliterated the
past the idea was inspiring and lent
brilliancy to her eyes she felt a keen
desire for conquest that in view of her
failure in connecticut was pitifully par-
donable

  there was no end of hilarity during
the evening daring bits of acting from
the love scenes of the operas secret
tete-a-tctes and moments stolen even
though publicly later there followed
the supper where there seemed an abun-
dance of wine a circle of cheeks flushed
lips moist eyes bright and waves of per-
fume surging up from scented bodies
warm from dancing while floating
through the scene like a veil was the
thin haze of cigarettes

  twice as she listened to the chime of
the hall clock she found bentons eyes
fixed upon her t think thorley should
be here dont your she looked puzzled
as her glance traveled from edith to
benton and still more puzzled at ediths
reply

  it is unconventional and unpopular
laughed edith to worry about ones
husband prav do not be so new eng-
land r

  that night as amy and benton drove
home alone in the machine a peculiar si-
lence for friends to maintain settled
upon them

  at length benton spoke you do not
fit into that crowd for a minute amy
you were honestly worried about thor-
ley and not one of them would have be-
lieved it

  it does not seem so new england to
me as natural for a wife to wonder why
her husband does not keep his word
the way edith took my anxiety made
me rather ashamed of having been
decent

benton laughed that is the shame
you will have to learn to cover up if you
	breezy

  try to keep up with people of that class 
  i may not keep up with them paul
  but i am going to cultivate them did
  you hear that rich mr morvabe say he
  would take the whole party down to
  faverly this summer that is where
  edith and i were bom you know-
  youve been there

    benton replied petulantly i do not
  see any especial need of introducing that
  noisy rather coarse crowd to the sim-
  ple easy-going new england natives
  people down there might misjudge you
  no more than they do at present i
  want them all coming back to me as
  edith matterson came back  confessed
  amy frankly the friendship of promi-
  nent people will make them o it when
  they see famous people clever people
  courting me she added childishly they
  will be only too glad to do the same
  benton compressed his lips you are
  verniers wife and so  can have nothing
  to say but if i were in your husbands
  place i would insist that you let the opin-
  ion of those faverly people remain as it
  is you are all right as you are-to-

-	day

    he tried to choke the last word but it

 escaped him why to-day amys
 hand lightly touched bentons arm you
 know then dont you 

    i know nothing except that yon are a
  good woman and i see no reason why
  you should be so anxious to enlarge
  your circle of friends at the expense of
  your reputation

     those friends of ediths are brilliant
  paul

     excuse me arav they are contemp-
  tible	

    the car grated upon the edge of the
  curb and came to a stop

   benton opened the door and took
  amys hand tell yenner that i said
  you needed a chaperon good-night
  amys good-night was hardly audible
  and her feet dragged a little wearily as
  she entered her own apartment

    she wondered if thorley were home
  and if he had worried about her and
  why he had not come for her why
  had she allowed her mother to marry
  her to this man and why had this man
  wanted her

stories

  for the hundredth time site felt the

sting of having been married by her
mother to one man to cover the scandal
caused by relations to another hot up-
on the heels of this humiliating alliance
came the realization that thorley ven-
ners people were stations innumerable
bow er own the yenners had never
associate- with such people as the colla-
mores of connecticut her family name
as well as her money had helped to place
thorley where he was to-day-in a
wholesale importing house she bit her
lips as she recalled that only that day
there had arrived a consignment of rugs
from india she wondered if dick balsh
had anything to do with her husbands
firm and if he ever had taken the trouble
to inquire how she had come out after
his sudden departure

  it had only jeen a case of fancied love
between them they had been thrown
together for a week at a gay house party
where excitement had gone to her head
like wine and iad blinded her to all but
a lovers passionate insistence a few
months later with pale lips and fright-
ened eyes she had told dick balsh her
fears reckless thoughtless and brutal
he had left town and gone to india

  a little later she too went away with
her mother for a six months stay and
then-

  in spite of her efforts the past con-
tinued to recur to her probably it was
the sight of edith teller again or the
suggestion that in her home town she
had been anything but a prude that
left a feeling of foreboding there was
nothing to conceal from her husband
thorley yenner had known all about her
mysterious absence from faverly farms
those fatal six months known of the
slights of her former friends edith tel-
ler among them and known why she
had been the orchid in the gutter which
he could not afford to purchase at the
greenhouse while he had been to her the
one escape from ostracism the one
refuge under a new name

  now more than ever before she
longed to go back to faverly in company
with a talented party who petted and ad-
mired her to do this she must be a
good fellow joke with these people
her home town	

   laugh dance sing even drink with them
   at faverly she dreamed she would give
   a concert in the town hall tor the benefit
   of the church she herself would act as
   accompanist she would he faverlys
   benefactor who had brought these artists
   to her home town

    the following morning vernier began
  closing up his business and holding long
  conversations with darrow about the
  agricultural financial and political pros-
  pects in mexico later they began the
  study of spanish and seeing that the call
  of conquest was upon them amy volun-
  teered the money rather than humiliate

	her husband by allowing him to ask for
  it how much will you need thorley
  she inquired as she drew her check book
  from the drawer

a couple of thousand to start dear
i know you wont kick youre no piker
amy wrote the check and passed it
to him i do not forget thorley she
ventured meekly

    well you can if you want to no-

ibody thinks of all that yam now amy
collamore is dead you are mrs thor-
ley venner edith has probably forgot-
ten it also even forgotten she ever
snubbed you give the devil his due

    i do not think edith forgets re-
  marked amy thoughtfully the ques-

stion is whether i can make myself of
such value to her friends that no skele-
ton can frighten them with tales of me
its my personality of to-day against my
reputation of yesterday

    the next party that edith matterson
  gave amy persuaded her husband to at-
  tend he seemed terribly ill at ease
  and clung to benton for protection for
  heavens sake paul what do you and
  amy sec in this crowd  the police raid
  places far more respectable than this
  that drake woman hasnt clothes enough
  on to make a pen-wiper and the husband
  of that woman with john morvalle
  doesnt make enough money to buy her
  hairpins gee its a riddle to me sup-
  pose they are happy

    no they are crazy unnatural re-
  plied benton thev are not fit to look
  at amy

    venner veered suddenly shes set
  on cultivating them though why i

dont know but if she wants to im
game i owe a good deal to amy

  you owe her protection more than
anything replied benton angrily

  whether the remark went home or
not benton never knew venner had
an exasperating way of believing that
he could do no wrong after having done
the magnificent thing of bestowing his
name upon a woman

  in disgust at him benton turned and
went in search of amy she was as
usual surrounded john morvalle and
his female satellites were arranging for
a theater party a luncheon and a tea
the following week as he passed them
he overheard their plans for the coming
summer in a place they joyfully agreed
where no one would know them and they
would not need to care what they did

  they were looking then for a land
of unrestrained liberty and had strange-
ly picked a little town in an old blue law
state for their stamping ground ben-
ton wondered as he watched them just
how much more liberty it would be pos-
sible for them to take than that in which
they reveled now

  the tiresome evening for venner was
at last over his mind had not been
with the guests but down in mexico
where as he termed it a man had a
chance

  all during the ride home venner ex-
patiated over the freedom of living in
the open where he quoted bromidically
there aint no ten commandments it
seemed to amy every one was longing
for just such a spot on earth she won-
dered if it were a sign that the world
was growing worse because of this desire
or better because the demands of decency
were growing more restraining

  the fact that venner too was cramped
in the land of restraint was proven
when early in february he started for
mexico in company with darrow at
his request benton came with amy to
the pier but he could not fail to notice
that venners anxiety about amys social
and moral welfare was far exceeded by
his anxiety over the tardiness of sailing

  at last the gang plank was pulled in
and he was waving good-by to his wife
and friend long before amy thought


breezy stories

of leaving the pier venner and darrow
had moved out of sight to the other side
of the boat

  it is going to be different now be-
gan benton as they retraced their steps
to the street i cannot run up as i used
to unless you keep a maid or companion
why you have persisted in doing your
own work i do not know

  to keep my mind occupied i guess
i do not like to think too much

  you ought to have an older woman
with you suggested benton i know
of one she would not only take the care
off your hands which will not be so
much with venner away but she will be
company for you

  i will be lonely wont i but then
mrs drake and mrs holden have
promised to run in often

  benton ignored that let me send
the woman up will you-a mrs gerry
she will be like a mother to you-some
one to go back to after you have been
out with your firefly friends

  all right send her up

  so it was decided and the following
evening mrs gerry appeared

  she was a motherly soul who never
seemed to be idle but rather always look-
ing for some new service to perform

  one evening at the close of mrs
gerrys first week she came hurrying in
to amys room a lady with a lovely
voice is calling you on the telephone
ive been wondering why some of your
girl friends havent been coming around
knowing as they do that you are alone
at the telephone mrs holdens voice
came cooing over the wire

  is that you amy dear well this
is blanche holden john morvalle and
i want to come up and see you for a
while we knew you would be lonely
and we are just tired to death of being
stared at by people who do not under-
stand us may we come

  here was sincere comradeship with
one whom society dare not scorn here
was one who not only appreciated her
loneliness but trusted her with her se-
crets of course they must come was
not this the beginning of her achieve-
ment this trust of blanche holden
would she not in case of any stalking

skeleton in her own life be in her debt
for this secret meeting and expect her
silence

  it was not more than a half hour after
their arrival however that amy found
herself being eliminated from the con-
versation and later her very presence be-
coming ignored in a semi-conscious
way she realized that her training must
have been narrow that a clandestine love
scene such as was being enacted in word
and tone before her eyes was the privi-
lege of the accepted in society

  suddenly the trio were startled by the
ringing of the telephone amy laid
down her book to answer the call a
faint feeling stole over her as she took
down the receiver a fear that some one
might call who would not could not
approve made the whole situation appear
ghastly and unhealthy the voice came
clear over the wire

  this is mr holden speaking is
blanche there amys hand quickly
covered the transmitter it is your hus-
band blanche what shall i say 

  tell him im not here goosie but
that you expect me later then if lie
chooses to call why johnnie will be
gone see

  amy removed her hand and weighed
the lie for the fraction of a second
mrs holden has not arrived yet she
promised to come up some time and i
am expecting her

  that is all right then came the re-
ply she was not home for dinner nor
at the mattersons i just wondered if
she could be with you good-night
nervously amy clicked the receiver
back upon the hook as she turned
morvalles arms were around blanche
holden

  i think mr holden wanted to be sure
that you were safe said amy coldly
he trusts you-he loves you

  poor tom sighed blanche holden
flippantly i suppose he does that is
the pity he loves and never under-
stands 

  there seemed to be a shade of excuse
if not propriety in the remark and amy
attempted to store it away upon the
shelves of her limited experience long
after her guests had left she sat and
her home town

 pondered over the difference between
f real and imaginary sin

   in the week that followed benton
j came but once and that time for dinner
j amy was strangely quiet at length

	she mentioned having read something to
the effect that one had better be forever
j on the outside of public approval than
to climb up to it by a muddy path and
asked benton what he thought of it

   what do you mean he asked are
j you beginning to be disgusted with your
 new friends

   oh no not at all blanche holden
 was here the other evening

   with morvalle i imagine

   why yes he did come with her

benton pushed his plate a trifle aside
 and leaned over the table of course
i know they asked to come but you will
never return the call with me i hardly
 think you expect to but i want you to
e remember i am playing fair with thor-
 ley yenner i should never come here
now unless mrs gerry were here you
know that dont you

   the question was unanswered because
 j of the entrance of mrs gerry bearing a
 letter excusing herself amy broke the
 seal it was from ada drake she read
 it through carefully then looked up with
 a flushed face from the monogrammed
 sheet

   it is from ada drake she began
 timidly and i am afraid i shall have
 to ask you to go i would not like her

to misunderstand-to think- amy
floundered i will read you the letter

    blanche has been telling me what a
 perfect little brick you were the other
 night i am so anxious to have signor
 patrici sing for me alone of course
 he cannot do this at my home with my
 husband and ten-year-old son to watch
 him so i am throwing myself upon your
 mercy this evening

    i would have given you more no-
 tice only this is patricis last night be-
 fore the opening when i found by
 telephone that you were out this mom-
 mg i simply had to send this by mes-
 j sengcr we will arrive around eight-
 thirty	 your unhappy

 ada drake 



  benton waited a moment after she
had finished reading before he could
control his voice to speak then he rose
and brought hishand firmly down upon
the back of amys chair  when will
you stop turning your home into a ren-
dezvous for disreputable women what
in heavens name do you hope to gain
i mean to gain those connecticut
friends of mine all bade ada is good-
hearted and-well anyway it is too late
to disappoint a friend amys head
drooped and her voice was scarcely audi-
ble i suppose edith has told her in a
casual way that she could trust her se-
crets with me that my lips were sealed
no womans lips are sealed who de-
mands decent people around her i sup-
pose you refer to that groundless little
scandal in your home town years ago
are you going to permit it to be a
spectre of perpetual blackmail

  for a moment a shadow crossed amys
face it wras like a cool restful shade in
the heat of a weary day a shade of the
confidence her one best friend reposed in
her but he was a friend who must not
be deceived lifting her eyes she spoke
quite fearlessly that was not a
groundless scandal paul that was the
truth that is my reason for demanding
that my friends of faverly shall come
back to me

  benton had never quite believed in
that horrible story that had come to him
in suggestive bits but now it flashed
truthfully even defiantly at him now
he understood what darrow meant when
he had stated that it was pretty white
in thorley vernier to marry her again
the remark long since forgotten sprang
into whispered sound

  what do you suppose dick balsh will
say when he hears the news

  surprise was followed instantly by de-
fense true or not amy whatever it
was you did not walk deliberately into
it such an act isnt in the blood of
descendants of such women as this

  he took up the photograph of aunt
annie hallet and looked at it admiringly
do not allow such women as this one
coming up to-night to influence any
part of your life

  he put the picture back upon the table


breezy stories

and with a short good-night took his hat
and coat and left the room

  when ada drake and patrici entered
the apartment they were astonished at
the pallor upon amys face why
honey child cried ada you look fright-
ened has any one been scolding you 
without a reply she stepped to the tele-
phone now give me that handsome
paul bentons number and we will have
him here right away he can make you
smile again i know

  as she passed the little white table so
out of harmony with the rest of the
unique room she paused and took up
the one photograph that reposed serene
in its embroidered linen frame

  merciful heaven amy  she ejacu-
lated as she gazed at the staunch sup-
porter of connecticuts blue laws do
you save all your patent medicine ad-
vertisements 

  that is no advertisement replied
amy a trifle indignantly that is a
picture of a darling old aunt of mine i
love her

  oh well of course ada drakes
tone was conciliatory one must love
ones relatives but let us call benton up
anyhow

  i do not want to see him

  oh very well ada laughed lightly
just as you like as for myself i have
an evening off rodney drake does not
expect to be home before two oclock
thank goodness gone to a club some-
where i can have tony singing all to
myself here until one-i hope they arent
fussy in these apartments she inter-
polated as for you i know you do
not mind edith said so

  the evening rapidly developed into
one strikingly similar to the one blanche
hojden had originated the week before

  soon amy again found herself elimi-
nated quite unconsciously relegated to
the little reading room adjoining her
parlor as she called it with new eng-
land dignity though deep in the mys-
teries of a book there floated now and
then to her the amorous tones of patrici
speaking to ada drake in song

  finally amys mind began a thought-
ful analysis of the situations as they
were teekly developing in her home

why had ada drake and blanche hol-
den singled her out from all their friend
and former acquaintances it gradually
became a fact as well as a fear that in
some way by some person she had been
spoken of as probably condoning these
visits

  the more she thought of the innocent
part she was playing in the secret meet-
ings of her friends the more she detested
herself for having permitted them
what if her own marriage had been one
of convenience once in it she had
played the game fairly and it gave her
a sense of delight when she realized that
the man who would see that she had done
so was none other than benton who was
undoubtedly alluded to as her lover

  the long evening came to a close and
she found herself being embraced by
ada drake while patrici was foolishly
kissing her hand and promising to send
her boxes for all the operas

  after the departure of her guests amy
began to contemplate the coming sum-
mer surely these people would not
carry their indiscretions to faverjy
farms her home town what she had
decided for them to take was their popu-
larity their talents their love and more
than all their approval of her

  it was during a luncheon at edith
mattersons the following day that amy
abruptly demanded why these new
friends used her house as a meeting
place leaning back against the cush-
ions of the couch in ediths drawing-
room she asked do ada drake or
blanche holden ever take their men
friends alone to the home of any one
else 

  gracious no they would not dare
edith sat bolt upright any one else
might talk

  then why might not i 

  edith flushed bit her lips and coughed
slightly you will pardon me dear if
i say you would not dare

  and why amy felt impelled to
demand a reply

  oh because of-of benton

  you are evading edith you know
paul benton and i are nothing tt one
another you refer to a time long be-
fore benton answer me 
her home town



  edith hesitated then rose and ex-
tended her hand come on dear come
on out to luncheon

  i want your answer

  very well then-yes

  one always pays a penalty then even
among strangers remarked amy sadly
discovered sin is like the proverbial
sword isnt it-suspended above ones
head by a hair some one is always
ready to cut it loose and let it fall

  edith shrugged her shoulders in de-
fense the sword usually does that
by its own weight but lets forget it
she added brightening we are going
to faverly all of us you will have a
wonderful array of clothes she declared
inquiringly you always do clothes in
a country town are so like charity they
cover such a multitude of sins

  ediths remarks had their effect but
they did not deter amy from her pur-
pose in forcing faverly to acknowledge
her as they must acknowledge her
friends the next few weeks were de-
voted to preparation a mass of soft
silks and muslins sent home at the last
moment from the dressmakers lay upon
the chairs and couches in every room

  amy surveyed them critically a la-
tent thought suggested that they would
do for mexico in the fall should thor-
ley send for her

  mexico would be new even though
thorley her husband would be old-old
in knowledge of her as amy collamore
and tactless in reminding her that his
name made an even balance for her
money if only education or good breed-
ing were back of that name some recom-
pense for having bought her reputation

  somewhere she had read of a man
who tried to crawl up to the light from
the depths of a forgotten well by means
of decayed roots and twigs that pro-
truded from the rocks and would have
sunk had he not gained a foothold in a
cleft she could not tell why the old
story came so vividly before her to-day
but at the sound of the bell it faded from
her mind

  benton was calling to say good-by be-
fore going to europe his call meant a
storm the kind that she feared yet
craved he would continue to denounce

her friends but his very denunciation
bore the delight of protection of her

  he came in with his usual greeting of
hows everybody and surveyed the
room what is this he asked as his
eyes rested upon numberless gowns and
hats wardrobe for the faverly pro-
duction 

  that is just it i am going the day
after to-morrow

  benton removed his hat and gloves
and drew a chair beside the little white
table expect to see aunt annie
amy faltered why yes i suppose
so she lives there

  stop and think amy bentons
face was determined are you going
to introduce your friends to that dear
sensible god-fearing woman he
reached for the photograph and looked
tenderly at it

  i suppose so

  do you expect her to like them
amy rose indignantly that is
neither your affair nor hers how am
i to know whether she will like them
or not  what does it matter anyway  i
am not anxious for aunt annies opin-
ion she is a dear of course but be-
hind the times

  then if you want to be beloved by
the people of your home town you want
to keep right where aunt annie is now
-behind the times the very worst
thing you can do to reinstate yourself is
through such people as the drake and
holden women

  they are my friends

  pardon me they are your enemies
they have not an atom of love for you
yourself you are merely an agreeable
landlady who presides without charge
over an establishment where crime may
have some semblance of respectability
up to this minute i believe you have
been ignorant of your offence but if you
go to faverly and carry out your inten-
tion of playing popular favorite you are
going to invite disgust not admiration
his argument was convincing but she
replied in calm defense

  but think paul think of the cause
that prompts it

  you are merely adding fuel to the
fire of years ago you cannot radiate
u	breezy

forgetfulness by flaunting wealthy
showy immorality i tell you amy i
am going to put my foot down in this
matter thorley is in mexico and
whether there is love between you or
not there is a certain amount of respect
due him and under the conditions as i-
know them he would forbid you to go
with this crowd and open your mothers
house for their private meetings more-
over he added compressing his lips
i am going to forbid it myself in thor-
ley s stead

  you do not dare supposing for one
moment edith has inadvertently let slip
any gossip of the past cant you see how
any act of mine that did not coincide
with theirs would blazon it

  at last you half imagine the duplicity
of mrs matterson then benton seized
her hands and drew her roughly to his
side you do dont you then why
are you running a race with it i tell
you you cannot demand the respect of
people-you must earn it

  amy wrested her hands from him i
wish you would go she said calmly
my mind is fully made up

  the bell rang sharply startling them
if that is any of mrs mattersons
friends began benton i am going to
settle with them myself and let them put
any estimate upon my authority they
wish- the worst they may imagine of
me is not as full of danger to you as
what is ahead

  mrs gerry was hurrying down the
hall to the door

  remember amy continued benton
if you are going to become a human
paradox and throw away your reputa-
tion for the purpose of regaining it the
time has come when i should take thor-
leys place

  a yellow envelope was thrust into
mrs gerrys hand and then passed to
amy with an inexplicable terror she
tore the end and drawing out the half
sheet read noting her pallor benton
signed the book and reached for the
message it seemed to jump into num-
berless lines instead of one

   enner killed in a street riot letter
following	darrow

stories

   benton lifted his eyes to see mrs
 gerry run to amy as she lay crumpl

  up in a chair the back of which was cov-
 ered with a profusion of summer finery

   he reached for a decanter of brandy
 and pouring some into a glass held it to
 her lips she swallowed it mechanically
 her eyes staring straight ahead h
 was a good man she murmured he
 gave me more than i gave him there
 are some things that money cannot buy

   mrs gerry wept as a mother might
 for a stricken child not comprehend-
 ing though she heard

   thorley had to save you amy per-
 haps this was the only way bentons
 voice choked as he recorded what seemed
 to him a miracle it gave him a little
 comfort to know that as conscienceless
 as her friends were they would be
 obliged to respect her period of mourn-
 ing ani difring that time amy would see
 their shallowness with careful instruc-
 tion to mrs gerry to care for amy ben-
 ton went out and telegraphed for mrs
 collamore amy would be safe undej
 the protection of her mother the fol-
 lowing day mrs collamore arrived and
 a week later darrow came from mex-
 ico with yenners body

   wtiether real or fancied amys grief
 made no difference to the friends who
 left as they had planned for faverly
 ada drake in a perfunctory manner be-
 wailed the loss but more especially the
 inability of amy to wear her summer
 finery edith matterson very logically
 and very naturally dropped into the ver-
 nacular of new england and stated it
 wasnt as though amy was left without
 money

   the real attitude of the party how-
 ever was voiced by blanche holden
 when she remarked after admiring the
 connecticut town

   isnt it a shame that all this had to
 happen to amy just at this particular
 time she made a perfect heaven of
 her new york home for us and every
 time i pass that collamore estate with
 its verandas nooks and vine-covered
 corners i have to repeat it-what a
 shame

   benton had gone to europe directly
 after venners burial his absence
her home toux

so

seemed only natural to amy he was
she reasoned merely a friend he rare-
ly wrote and even then guardedly the
loss of her opportunity to shine in faver-
ly surrounded by her new-found friends
sprang into the light of a blessing to
amy venner upon the receipt of each
separate letter from aunt annie hallet
at first the party that had descended
upon the quiet town had awed then
shocked and finally disgusted the natives
edith matterson has grown too broad
wrote aunt annie hallet she has ac-
quired a new religion valueless of
course because not orthodox-that por-
tended sin was unreal-in fact did not
exist hence the abandon of her friends
at length the summer season came to
an end and the party were returning
from faverly edith was the first to
call while amy was serving tea edith
found courage to remark i dont see
any reason why you should not begin
to go out a little now it isnt as if you
had really cared for mr venner you
know

  amy shivered it was all a terrible
mistake-an injustice to both of us we
should have waited and borne our sep-
arate difficulties alone not inflicted them
upon one another-without love

  edith laughed musically for good-
ness sake amy you do not believe in
those connecticut notions that marriages
should be made for love alone do you 
i do out of justice to thorley i
should have waited until i loved him be-
fore i married him

  and he i suppose should have wait-
ed until he had made money himself or
fallen heir to it absurd you were
quite right both of you it was an ex-
cellent opportunity for you and for him
ada drake thinks you were a clever lit-
tle sinner

 ada drake is heartless amys
voice trembled

  ada drake is worth a half million
dollars ventured edith calmly

  you speak as if dollars covered de-
ceit and lies were permissible to mil-
lionaires

 do not get so excited amy we
all deceive and lie a little now you-
you yourself for example

  amys eyes shone with a light edith
did not recognize in view of the fear
that had always before lurked within
them then if i lie i am going to stop
it from now on i am not going to turn
my house into a rendezvous for women
of her class and mrs holdens why
should i when had my own reputation
been clean they never would haveno-
ticed me why did they choose me and
my home for their clandestine meetings
what did i ever show them but the
strictest loyalty to thorley when he was
alive

  you forget two things dear edith
was exasperatinglv calm you forget
benton and you forget your past

  for a moment amy winced it was
a fight to the death now

  bentons name is quite out of the
question she argued we never had
a secret look word or meeting apart
from thorley as for my past sh
added bravely i wish to live away from
it not up to it you should have re-
alized that when you told them about
me

  edith was fastening her glove an
amused smile upon her face you can
never say amy that i did not give you
an opportunity to meet clever people
do i understand she said rising that
you do not care to visit me any more
visiting you edith brings me into
complications which i can only explain
by humiliation and lies and i will not lie
for such women as blanche holden and
ada drake

  or me please add remarked edith
coldly as she walked toward the door
you will pardon me she added irritat-
ingly if i say i fancy this attitude is as-
sumed for paul benton

  without the formality of a good-by
edith matterson left the room as amy
heard the door close she realized with
a certain degree of happiness that no
matter why she had taken this stand
benton would be pleased

  it was late in october when he re-
turned from europe it was the day fol-
lowing when he called and stood survey-
ing amy a moment before speaking it


breezy stories

isnt the gown that has changed you-

what is it

  amy smiled a trifle loneliness
maybe i do not see any one scarcely
these days

  somehow benton recognized an ex-
pression of submission rather than sor-
row upon amys face and he became
curious to know the cause

  i wish you knew he began had
always known how infinitely superior
you are to those women who call upon
you are you always going to cultivate
them-or worse may be receive them v
amy shook her head for some rea-
son now that the desired reply was
ready she found it difficult to give it

  has that drake woman been here
lately  benton reached across and took
amys hand i see by the papers that
her husband is suing for divorce
none of them come paul any more
inot once since last summer

  do you miss them

  not at all i requested them
through edith matterson to remain
away

  benton rose and crossed the room to
amys side you did that for me
didnt you dear

  partly although if i had never seen
you again i should have done it just
the same i had to do it for myself
bentons hand held amys closely i
knew you would do that finally he said
gratefully just as i knew when i left
europe that i should return there to live
permanently

  with an impulsive cry amy held her
free hand to her throat

  dont leave me paul-not yet

  raising her gently from the chair he
held her to him i have no intention
of doing so i am going to take you
with me-i want you to marry me i
want you to marry for love this time

  she smiled a wonderfully happy smile
and then lowered her eyes

  you want me to say something more
dear what is it he asked

  she did not speak and benton stood
thinking mutely asking himself one
question after another until finally the
words she desired came freely joyfully
to his lips

  i want you to marry me amy be-
cause i love you-because i know you
are a good woman

  her arms clung around his neck while
she sobbed as one acquitted of a crime
all the pent-up emotion and struggles
of the past giving way in the bliss of his
assurance and vindication

  we wont take a thing from here
he said as he led her around her unique
room we will sell it or give it to mrs
gerry

   they were standing in front of the lit-
tle white table when benton picked up
the photograph of aunt annie hallet
except this dearest it occupied the
smallest space in this funny old room
but he added as he looked admiringly
at it i have known from the first that
the old blue laws it stood for formed the
biggest part of you
at twilight

 by helen coale crew

tt oe adams was not overburdened
 with worldly goods save for his
i modest wardrobe the horse he rode
 tf and a tiny house back there on the

i	edge of civilization he had nothing he

	could call his own unless you will ex-
   cept such intangible possessions as youth
  and courage and a light heart and of
  these he seemed to have left the last be-
  hind him as he rode down over the pass
  into twilight one september afternoon
  for his forehead was wrinkled into a
  great frown and he rode slowly deep in
  thought and indeed he was out upon
  a momentous errand whereof he was al-
  ij ready questioning the wisdom

like the bachelor of mother goose
fame though he put his bread and cheese
upon the shelf he yet could not outwit
the rats and mice and must needs go to
it get himself a wife

    but hang it all he said to himself
  what on earth could i do with her be-
  tween meals  by which it becomes evi-
  dent that the little winged lad of bows
  and arrows had nothing to do with his
  faring forth on this particular afternoon
  a year ago he had been able to count
  on the fingers of one hand-barring the
  thumb-the girls whom he believed he
  had the courage to ask and at twilight
  was bess ashby the last on the list

    twilight is as well named as any town
  in colorado since it has beeii in its
  death throes so long that it has even
  forgotten its former glory were it not
  for mrs ashby who runs the postoffice-
  grocery combination it would have been
  dead and buried long since but mrs
  ashby is a capable woman managing not
  only uncle sams mail and the stove and
  her own household but also the town
  and its inhabitants most joyfully would
  she also have run the railroad which
  winds up from salida stops a brief mo-
  ment at twilight and then plunges into

the canyon beyond with reverberating
roars to climb heavenward over the
pass but even the greatest of dictators
has his limitations and mrs ashby is
wise enough to know hers

  when joe adams fastened his horse
to the hitching-post at the postoffice door
he felt that he was about to cast his last
die kate kennedy up at gunnison
where he had bossed a construction gang
the winter before had accepted him at
first and jilted him afterward greatly to
his relief ruth patterson over on the
cochetopa hills where a tunnel was be-
ing cut had refused him point blank
much to his bewilderment and down
at saguache where he spent some weeks
helping to turn what was left of the
saguache river into irrigation ditches-
so that now on the map it no longer
empties anywhere - pretty spanish
nita vasco had mourned openly because
she was already engaged when he pro-
posed to her and joe discovering that
her lover had a jealous eye and a long
knife had beat a hasty retreat now he
must cither win bess ashby or return a
disconsolate bachelor to his shack in the
hills at mears junction

  pa ashby lifted his rheumatic joints
out of a chair on the narrow porch and
moved forward to meet joe

  howdy joe howdy he quavered
reaching out a trembling hand before
joe could answer mrs ashby came out
tossed a mail-bag into a waiting cart
with muscular arm then turned to joe

  how do joe you havent honored
twilight for some time down on busi-
ness she glanced the young man
over noting the neat suit the white col-
lar and the purple bee-flower in his but-
tonhole

joe blushed prodigiously and kept an
uneasy silence pa ashby glanced up




breezy stories

and a thrill of recollection stirred his old
blood courtin joe he cackled

  let him alone pa said his daughter
but the old man had found a congenial
subject and could not drop it at once
takes a lot o nerve joe he went on
a powerful lot o nerve but youll land
her who be she but here mrs ash-
by interfered and followed by joe led
the way to the little parlor back of the
store

  sit down joe she said cordially
and settled her own big frame in a
creaking rocker how do you like run-
ning the station up there at the junc-
tion 

  first rate replied joe wiping his
hot forehead mears junctionll be a
town before you knowr it theres three
houses there now got a new house -my-
self

  got a new house have you

  yes shes a dandy three rooms
and right across from the station

  furnished asked mrs ashby

  joe slapped his breast pocket ill let
my wife do that he said i wouldnt
know how

  mrs ashby laughed a big warm laugh
 fess up joe she said is it my
bess

  yes said joe and wondered why
he didnt feel happier mrs ashby not-
ing the lack of enthusiasm in his voice
gazed at him keenly dont make a mis-
take joe she warned him

  no no i-i wont said joe and
really thought he meant it

  mrs ashby called bess from the
kitchen and the girl came in flushed
from her work about the stove a youth-
ful image of her mother rosy and alert

  mrs ashby stepped out into the store
in the pause that followed the first greet-
ing while bess rolled down the sleeves
over her sturdy young arms and toe
cleared his throat huskily they could
hear her mother speaking to the old man
and presently his voice floated in to
where they stood

  hell land her hell land her he
said shrilly with a knowing laugh i
landed the very fust gal i axed but it
takes nerve then the door slammed

  besss clear eyes softened and the rosy

color deepened in her cheeks as she
looked at the young man who stood be-
fore her during the half yea he had
been at mears junction she had met him
frequently enough to compare his abun-
dant energy favorably with the more or
less slouching attitude of the twilight
youths and to more than admire hi
straight figure sturdy strength and hon-
est eyes now she yearned for his love
yet she knew that it was not hers

  joe she said dout beat about the
bush you dont really want me you
just want a housekeeper isnt that so
she paled a little as she spoke

  bess said joe youve hit it but
honestly theres not another girl in the
world i like half as well as you and id
be an awfully proud man if youd marry
me

  bess nodded smiled and shook a tear
from her eye joe took her hands in his
and kissed her gently

  i can love enough for two-for a
while said bess but youll have to
take a turn at it joe

  i will i will he exclaimed and
then they sat down to talk over the
furnishing of the new house

  presently however he took his depar-
ture for he had to be back at the junc-
tion for the down train and relieve his
companion there a green hand at the
telegraph instrument leaving the town
behind he climbed the hill that led away
from the valley to the heights beyond
the sun was nearing its setting and the
broad green valley cut lengthwise by the
yellow waters of tle arkansas was
flooded by the level rays joe turned his
back upon the splendor and his face to
the sombre hills pine-clad silent terrible
in their remote serenity his horses
hoofs clattered over a little bridge and
slowed down to steady climbing

  well said joe and sighed thats
settled

  and just then at the turning of the
road where a crimson splash of sumach
glowed against the dark hemlocks fate
intervened down the road driving two
cows before her came a girl a slender
creature scarcely on the verge of woman-
hood the scant skirt of her faded blue
dress readied only to the tops of the
at twilight	

dusty little shoes her flower-like face
was purely pale in the shadow of her
dark hair she carried an armful of
goldenrod and as joe approached her
she raised great questioning eyes to his
as a child would her cheeks were tear-
stained

  god in heaven said joe below his
breath he reined in his horse sharply
and the girl terrified by the sudden
movement dropped her flowers joe
leaped down quickly and stooping gath-
ered up the stalks of goldenrod

  im sorry i frightened you he be-
gan and then gazing steadily into the
little timid face will you tell me your
name 

  my name is cynthia marsh

  do you live in twilight  i never saw
you there

  i live with old granny kelly down
yonder on the cedar trail a mile or
two

  i thought she had no kin

  she took me from the asylum to work
for her said the girl simply and i
come up every day to get mrs ashbys
cow and take it to pasture along with
ours

  a pause and then joe went oft gently
you have been crying

  a faint color crept into the pale
cheeks i was lonely she said

  isnt mrs kelly kind to you

  oh yes

  another pause the tinkle of the cow-
bells came faintly the horse pawed im-
patiently in the dusty road the dusk
deepened a cold wind blew and the
shadows grew alien menacing joe had
the girls gaze with his im joe
adams he said slowly and id give
the whole world if i had met you an hour
ago then before the girls astonished
eyes he mounted his horse and was gone

  it is uphill all the way to the junction
and had joes thoughts not been so
tumultuous he would have found time
for reflection for so clear-eyed a chap
he rode rather blindly overwhelmed by
what had so suddenly and unexpectedly
befallen him could he indeed be the
man who had ridden forth so nonchalant-
ly but a few hours ago in search of a
wife the red west over the roofs of

twilight caught his eye and he thought
of bess and groaned the silver moon
rising above the hills smote his heart
with its pale beauty cynthiaf he
murmured cynthia

  arrived at the station he called roughly
to little bob cresson to come out
double-quick and get his horse little
bob a six-foot giant came out upon the
platform grinning

  another turn-down joe

  no you fool

  joe kicked the mail-bag down over the
edge of the steps into unknown depths in
the canyon below id like to kick the
whole damned universe he growled
savagely

  nowhere does the year die so glo-
riously as in the uplifted hills for while
the lower reaches are aflame with red
and gold the heavenward peaks are al-
ready white with snow but for joe
adams the splendor of october passed
unnoticed twice a week leaving little
bob in charge of the junction he rode
down between trains to twilight osten-
sibly to see bess ashby in reality to
catch a glimpse at least of cynthia
marsh sitting in the little parlor mak-
ing plans for the future with rosy-
cheeked bess he was arranging to time
his departure so as to meet cynthia as
she drove home the cows from pasture
and while he was outwardly loyal to
bess planning the new home with her
and purchasing at salida the pieces of
furniture she expressed a desire for his
heart was yearning for the wistful face
and wide eyes that flashed so eagerly at
his approach he never had more than
a few words with cynthia and then rode
on up the hill angry with himself and
furious with all his world besides

  november came at last red at sunrise
and saffron at sunset but with the days
between sunless yet clear like pearls
upon a string

  joe had been sorely tried of late bess
had made a visit to the junction and
had gone over the little house trans-
forming its awkward arrangements with
deft touches and putting linens and
blankets into place why could he not
love bess he asked himself or at least


breezy stories

be satisfied with her love for him had
he not wanted a housekeeper would
she not make a good one warm-hearted
capable and entirely to be depended
upon what more could a fellow want
anyway ah cynthia cynthia

  one afternoon just at dusk fresh
from the irritation of a visit to poor
bess joe came upon cynthia on the little
bridge over twilight water beyond the
turn of the road she was wrapped in
a little red cloak and she leaned upon
the railing watching the swirling moun-
tain stream below her the air was full
of fine white flakes of snow which fell
lightly upon her head and shoulders
her figure drooped disconsolately and
she was so wrapped in her thoughts that
she did not hear him coming joe dis-
mounted and approached softly

  cynthia the girl turned tears
had fallen upon her cheeks before she
could brush them away joes arms were
about her

  dearest girl what is the matter

  i was afraid you didnt love me she
said simply

  who can stem a mountain torrent
who can stop the progress of a storm
not these two and for a space the steady
hills might have reeled about them for
all they knew or cared presently
cynthia spoke

  i have only you in all the world joe
her words broke the spell joes arms
dropped to his sides he wondered if
she knew cynthia i cant- he
paused abruptly the girl took his hand
in both of hers and held it against her
cheek

  i have no father and no mother she
went on i cant even remember them
i have wanted somebody to love all my
life bess has a lover too i think she
looks so happy but pm sure he cant
compare with mine

  joe took her face in his hands the
twilight had deepened and he could just
see her glad eyes uplifted to his
cynthia you must meet me here to-mor-
row at this time i shall have something
to tell you

  tell me now she suggested

  no-no not to-night to-night is

ours then a last passionate embrace
and he was gone

  cynthia wrapped her doak about her
and went swiftly toward twilight bess
was sp kind she would tell bess the
happy news at the house she found
mrs ashby sorting mail in the office and
pa reading the morning paper cynthia
went out into the kitchen carefully clos-
ing the two intervening doors behind her
bess was getting supper she paused in
her operations with the frying pan and
looked up instead of the pale face and
listless figure she had been accustomed
to see here before her stood a veritable
young goddess with glowing cheeks and
great eyes lit by an inner flame she
gazed in wonderment at the transfigured
girl

  what has happened to you cynthie
she asked kindly she turned the frying
meat with dexterous wrist

  cynthia took hold of the sleeve of
besss gown bess she said softly i
have a lover

  a lover some one here in twi-
light why cynthia who can it be 
besss mind ran rapidly over the few
young men in the little town who by
grace of youth or circumstances might
be eligible as lovers

  i have loved him ever since i have
been here wrent on cynthia but i
only knew to-night that he loved me he
lives up at the junction she held back
the name as a last sweet morsel

  at the junction oh its bob cres-
son then a nice boy cynthia

  no bess his name is joe adams

  the spoon fell from besss hand and
clattered upon the floor her warm
cheeks paled and her blue eves narrowed
she seized cynthias shoulders

  has joe adams told you that he loved
you she demanded

  cynthias voice came in a frightened
gasp yes she said yes why
shouldnt he

  because hes mine said bess you
have stolen him  you are a thief do
you hear a thief she shook the
slender shoulders fiercely her voice
rose shrilly

  cynthia moaned oh bess she
said oh bess 
at twilight



  the door opened and mrs ashby fol-
lowed by pa came hurriedly in bess
paid no heed she was panting and her
hands trembled but still she shook the
frightened younger girl you knew
she screamed you knew he was
mine

  then at last cynthia asserted herself
no she said i did not know i am
not a thief nor a liar but now that i do
know i shall never speak to him again
wrenching herself free from besss
grasp she stepped quickly to the back
door and opened it a soft swirl of
snow entered cynthia drew herself
erect

  keep your lover i dont want him
then she went out into the night

  pa rubbed his knotted hands together
couldnt keep your beau could ye
bess he chuckled let the little gal
steal him from ye didnt ye bess in
my day-

  a firm hand was laid across his mouth
pa said mrs ashby you be quiet
bess you go upstairs and cool down
bess looked at her mother the hot
angry eyes wavered before the cool and
steady ones the girl turned and went
upstairs pa made one more effort
couldnt keep-

  pa you jes shut right up

  upstairs bess upon her bed wept
long and bitterly below her mother sat
by the window looking out into the dark
and the fast-falling snow pa fell asleep
the kitchen fire died down and went out
slipper ws forgotten the little clock
on the shelf ticked out sixty minutes and
then another sixty and then there came
a knock at the office door mrs ashby
stiff with cold opened the door and joe
adams came in his face was haggard

  mrs ashby he said i want to see
bess

  i think said mrs ashby that you
had better see me first her eyes were
hard

  see you first

  and explain about cynthia

  joe brushed an arm across his eyes as
though to clear away a mist does
bess know he asked

  yes

  i came to ask bess if she would
marry me to-morrow

  mrs ashby loved her daughter but
she also loved fair play joe she said
you made a mistake once in spite of
my warning are you going to make an-
other now 

  im going to do my duty said joe
doggedly mistake or no mistake its
all a fellow can do please call bess
mrs ashby sighed one can be wiser
at fifty than at twenty-five but one can
never be quite so determined followed
by joe she went to the kitchen and
called up the stairway to her daughter
after a few minutes bess came down
her eyes were heavy with weeping but
she held her head high

  bess i want you to marry me to-
morrow

  bess looked at him steadily her
mother watching her recognized in her
child a kindred spirit

  it is now or never bess said the
young man

  it is never said bess

  at this point pa who had been sleep-
ing heavily in his chair roused up and
blinked sleepily he gazed at the three
intent figures then he blinked know-
ingly throwed ye over hasnt she
joe and cynthys gone guess yere
left high and dry joe high and dry
joe turned instantly to the old man
where has cynthia gone

  bess there turned her out youve
got yourself in trouble joe courtin two
gals to oncet he rose stiffly from his
chair and peered out the window kind
o bad night to be out in too

  joe flashed upon bess with angry eyes
how long has she been gone he de-
manded

  since supper time replied the girl
dully

  and you turning to mrs ashby
you let that child go out into a night
like this one and alone hours ago
they called the little gal a thief i
heard em insisted pa

  with a groan joe hurled himself out
the door and slammed it behind him

  lttter peace reigned without the
snow had ceased falling and lay in soft


breezy stories

swirls and eddies the heavens were
bright although a cloud-wrack hid the
moon in the dear spaces of the sky
hung the steady stars far away up
could be heard the roar of a train enter-
ing a rocky tunnel joe galloped his
horse down the narrow rocky pathway
of cedar trail and reaching mrs kel-
lys desolate shack beat loudly upon the
door

  she aint home said mrs kelly
querulously in response to his eager
question i guess youd maybe find her
up at ashbys though the lord knows
what i took her out of the sylum for
to be traipesin lord knows where when
i need her-

  joe waited to hear no more but with
sinking heart hastened back to twi-
light he inquired at each of the few
houses in the little town but cynthia
had been to none of them he paused
uncertainly then turned up the road to-
ward the junction a wild hope had
arisen in his heart that cynthia might be
searching for him at the bridge he
paused again looking darkly and with a
shudder at the turbulent water a clat-
ter of hoofs behind him and bess ashby
rode up

  i will search with you she said

  without a word they turned their
horses up the hill silently they rode
the snow had hid all traces which pass-
ing feet might have made an hour earlier
in the dim light the pines threw faint
shadows across the white road here
and there a branch creaked softly two
miles up they came upon a little red cape
which joe buttoned inside his coat
whether it had been there as he came
down he could not tell so intent had he
been upon the thing he had in hand to
do a few turns more and they found
the snow beaten down beneath a huge
tree at the roadside where she must have
seated herself to rest on and up be-
fore them wound the still white miles
they rode-slowly peering everywhere
just once joe spoke

  bess didnt you remember that she
had  father no mother-no one

  she had you said bess bitterly

  when they reached the last stretch
the lights of the junction gleamed out
from the little grove of aspens that in-
closed the clearing about the station
with a sudden impulse they reined in
their horses and from behind a dark
mass of cloud rose the moon pouring
down a white radiance bess strained
her eyes up to where joes house-her
house-stood across from the station but
joe with a sudden cry leaped to the
ground and knelt beside a little huddled
form by the road for a moment bess
reeled dizzily in her saddle but when joe
called go get little bob she drew
herself together and obeyed

  they carried cynthia to joes house
and laid her upon the blue-covered couch
which bess had selected in salida with
such loving care and such tender hopes
little bob built a roaring fire and bess
with strange cold heart and strange
numb fingers went into the bedroom
and drew the blankets-her blankets-
from the bed to wrap about the uncon-
scious girl when at last she opened
piteous eyes upon them joe and bob
softly withdrew outside the door bob
seized joe by the arm and shaking him
roughly dragged him into the station

  what kind of a fool are you anyway
joe adams

  im all kinds replied toe with con-
viction

  want to kick the universe

  no want to kick myself almighty
good and hard

  say the word and   help said
bob

  an hour later bess entered the station
cynthia wants you she said briefly to
joe when he had gone she turned
sharply to bob send a telegram to
salida for me right away she said
tell dr williams to get a marriage
license for joseph adams and cynthia
marsh and take the eleven-forty train
to-night to mears junction without fail
she stood quietly by while the little
instrument ticked off its knell to her
happiness little bob rose to his feet
admiration shining in his eyes

  miss ashby he said youre the fin-
est girl i ever met by jove you are
im proud to know you
     the gray dawn crept over the eastern
   hills and slipped down into twilight
   pa spread his hands out over the kitchen
   stove where the lire crackled cheerfully
   and the coffee pot simmered fragrantly
   there he said presently i hear the
   down train

     mrs ashby opened the draughts and
   pulled the coffee pot forward she had
   not slept there were more lines in her
   face than had been there yesterday
   when at last the door opened and bess
   came in she said nothing but quietly
   moved about preparing a meal bess
   took off her coat and sat down wearily
   leaning her head against the dresser
   shelves from beneath her closed lids
   the tears fell slowly it is so much easier
    to be heroic under the stars than in the
   kitchen it is so vastly easier to be
   heroic for a moment upon impulse than

of set purpose through the long slow
  ears the mother asked no questions
  ut finally the girl spoke

  joe and cynthia are married

  pa who had not dared to break the
silence but had waited for an opening
took immediate advantage

  got him away from you did she
little slip of a gal tuo not half o your
heft aint ye got no sperrit bess

  a warning nudge deprived him of his
breath and his balance and he sat back
suddenly and involuntarily upon the
wood-box where his wifes angry eye
held him then she turned to bess the
keen face softened the determined lips
trembled and the sharp eye grew misty
with mot he r-love

 my lamb she murmured my
lamb and gathered the weeping girl to
her bosom

              by louise winter

it was half an hour before the time
appointed to meet bob for lunch
when florence found herself
staring into the windows of the hat
shop attracted by the tempting display
set out to catch the feminine fancy she
lingered longing in her eyes envy in her
heart she could not afford a new hat at
present although she had been the only
woman on the train that morning in a
straw hat

  and bob was going away back to the
canal zone to finish his work there
and he was going without having spoken
the words that florence had passionately
longed to hear from him

  they had grown up together neigh-
bors in the suburban town in which their
respective parents had elected to settle
they had been unacknowledged sweet-
hearts before this last contract had taken
him to panama he had been away
three years and he had come home a
month ago for a brief vacation and
though apparently he had been very glad
to see her again florence had missed
the lover-like quality that she had se-
cretly expected to find in his manner
toward her she could not help feeling
that she had disappointed him he had
come up on the steamer with some new
york girls classy girls he had de-
scribed them and several times he had
declined invitations to affairs in the
suburban home town because he had
been asked to some party in new york

  florence knew that she could not com-
pete with classy new york girls her
people were in moderate circumstances
and at present owing to general busi-
ness depression her father had informed
her sadly that he would have to cut her
dress allowance in half until things took
a turn for the better under these cir-
cumstances a new hat was out of the
question she had indulged in new white
gloves she had had her suit pressed



and her pumps shined but all these
things were discounted by the straw hat
decidedly shabby after having done ex-
cellent service for four months

  it would not have mattered so much
if bob were not so observant of all the
little details that w ent to make up a well-
groomed womans toilet but he had a
keen eye for accessories and florence
almost wished that she had not accepted
the belated invitation to lunch at the
waldorf though he had flattered her by
insisting that he wanted a farewell party
with her she had hesitated and then
because he was the one man she had ever
cared for she had put her pride aside
and had told him that nothing would
give her greater pleasure than a tete-a--
tete meal with him

  now she stood and gazed and then
telling herself it was merely to pass
away the time she stepped boldly into
the hat shop it did not entail any
obligation to look at the tempting wares
displayed

  the shop was crowded there was a
sale in progress and women came in
from both the avenue entrance and the
one on the side street

  saleswomen flew from one customer
to another frequently attending to half
a dozen at one time

  a showy blonde approached florence
just look around and ill be with you
presently that woman in front of the
mirror has tried on every hat in the
place shes got to decide on something
soon she explained with a sigh as she
contemplated the fussy customer who
had the shelf before her piled with hats
of every description say heres a
nobby little thing that would just suit
you try it on and ill be back in two
minutes as she spoke the saleswoman
dangled in front of florences eyes a
small draped turban of black velvet
ornamented with one stiff wing
yielding to temptation



 how much is it there was no
harm in asking the price

  twenty dollars and cheap at that
its a copy of a french model chick
isnt it and then with a glance over
her shoulder oh my shes signalling
to me i got to go and she pressed
the hat into florences hands and rushed
over to where the fussy woman with
wrath in her eye was waiting for her

  florence had gasped at the price
twenty dollars if she had had her full
allowance and been ready to purchase a
winter hat she would never have dared
to pay more than ten and yet-

  she glanced at her watch twenty
minutes to one still twenty minutes be-
fore she was to meet bob at the hotel
near by it couldnt do any harm to see
how she would look in a twenty-dollar
hat

  she walked deliberately over to one
of the long mirrors in front of the show-
cases removed the despised straw and
set the velvet toque primly on top of her
glossy brown hair

  another saleswoman passing took one
look and stopped

  not that way dearie allow me
and with skilful hands she readjusted
the toque placing it at an angle that was
so undoubtedly becoming that florence
herself was amazed

  thats better isnt it get a hand-
glass and look at the back you couldnt
find anything more becoming if you
searched a week then she went off
and florence stared at herself two spots
of color creeping up into her pale
smooth cheeks

  she did not look like the same dis-
pirited creature who had entered the
hat shop ten minutes ago this was
a radiant girl sure of herself and of
her own attractions

  she went in search of a mirror and
presently found herself in another room
quite as crowded as the first she had en-
tered but after a time she discovered a
handglass and was able to secure a view
of the toque from the rear

 tears came to her eyes what a
change a smart hat made in ones ap-
pearance  but twenty dollars-it was out
of the question

  another saleswoman addressed her
this time quite respectfully not at all
in the patronizing manner employed by
the other two take a seat wont you
ill be at liberty soon thats a very
smart hat you have on you did not get
it here did you

  fortunately an impatient customer
claimed the saleswomans attention and
florence was spared the necessity of an
explanation but a daring thought crept
into her mind the woman had not
recognized the hat as belonging to the
stock and yet she had only passed from
one room in the shop to another per-
haps the stock in the two rooms was kept
separate she edged toward the door
suppose she walked out boldly wearing
the twenty-dollar hat would any one
attempt to stop her

  she glanced again at her watch three
minutes to one she was a block from
the waldorf and bob hated to be kept
waiting

  her hand was on the knob and still
she hesitated it would be stealing even
if she only wore it to lunch and re-
turned it afterward

  unconsciously she turned the knob
and the next moment she was in the
street bob should go away with a
memory of her looking quite as smart as
the girls he had been running around
with lately when he got back to
panama he should not remember her as
shabby in a last summers straw he
should recall her as she had sat opposite
to him at luncheon in a toque copied
from a french model

  as she reached the sidewalk her heart
was in her mouth suppose some one
had noticed her andshe was followed
she could say it was a mistake of
course-

  but no one followed her she gained
the avenue waited for the signal to
cross entered the revolving doors of the
hostelry from the thirty-fourth street
side and caught a glimpse of bob in the
distance

  his eyes brightened as they took her
in admiringly

  some class to you to-day flo how
stunning you look he said as he
breezy stories



slipped his band tinder her elbow and
g-tiided her toward the dining room

  not until they were seated at a small
table near a window did florences heart
resume its normal beats she was safe
now no one would create a disturb-
ance in the restaurant and she gave her-
self up to the enjoyment of the hour be-
fore her after it was over-if no one
were waiting for her outside-she would
go back to the hat shop make some ex-
cuse and reclaim her shabby headgear
but for one hour she would bask in the
admiration bob took no pains to con-
ceal

  he ordered carefully consulting her
from time to time but she was content
to leave everything in his hands she
could not prevent her conscience from
troubling her but her nervousness only
heightened the color in her cheeks and
added to the brilliancy of her eyes

  to cover her uneasiness she talked
more than usual and bob foundher a
most entertaining companion

  he suddenly began to regret that he
had missed several opportunities of en-
joying florences society and now he
was going away to be gone for another
year and other men would have time to
discover what an attractive girl she was
he had alwrays been fond of florence
her memory had always remained in the
background as something solid he could
return to but now he recalled that he
had been away for three years and he
had not seen so much of her during his
brief vacation his mind had been full
of one of the girls he had met on the
steamer she was some chickeif and
he had delighted in rushing her but of
course nothing cotld come of that he
was only a young engineer drawing a
modest salary and the new york girl
had told him frankly that she could not
afford to marry a poor man rob had
not been at all sure he wanted to marry
her she was good fun but as a wrife-
now he admitted to himself that a wife
must be more on the order of florence
a girl who managed wonderfully on a
small income he knew her fathers
position and yet she contrived to look
smart and well groomed he glanced
from the hat to her new gloves lying

 beside her purse on the table that was
 the kind of a wife a poor man wanted
 one who could put up a good appear-
 ance on very little

   to do florence justice she never
 dreamed that the hat would carry bob
 so far she had merely wanted him to

 	obtain a last impression of her which
 shoukl compare favorably with the im-
 pression he carried away of other girls
 she wanted him to remember her well-
 dressed and happy not a pathetic little
 figure wearing her heart upon her sleeve
 she never imagined that she wrould sud-
 denly become desirable and so she was
 unprepared wdien he began to attack her
 for flirting with other men while he was
 grinding his life out down in panama

   she was bewildered she did not
 know enough about masculine vagaries
 to realize how in the twinkling of an eye
 she had changed for him

   as they lingered over their coffee he
 fell into a sentimental mood he de-
 scribed his lonely life in the canal zone

   of course some of the fellows have
 their wives with them lucky dogs a v
 girl has to care a lot for a fellow to
 put up with conditions down there and
 yet after all it isnt really so bad he
 began to see how comfortable it would
 be to have some one there with him
 some one like florence capable clever
 attractive

   she suddenly feared what wras com-
 ing did bob mean it it must be in-
 teresting she ventured shyly

    it is at first until the novelty wears
 off and then it gets to be monotonous

 a fellow would have to be pretty nervy
 to ask a girl to go there on her honey-
 moon he was feeling his way cau-
 tiously

   hed have to be sure that he loved
 her florence was very grave that
 it wasnt a passing fancy

   tt couldnt be that if hed known the
 girl all his life

   and only just realized that he
 cared 

   he suddenly saw her in a new light

   florence awoke to the situation or
 in a new hat she said quietly

   bob reddened t confess it docs
 make you look different
yielding to temptation

  and if i had worn my old sailor
he brushed that aside nonsense
florence of course it isnt the hat
its because im going away and ive
awakened to the fact that old feelings
are the ones that count ive always
cared for you werent we boy and
girl sweethearts theres never been
any one else with me doyou think
you could get ready on such short no-
tice he leaned toward her eagerly
he was young and impetuous and it
seemed to him now that his love for her
could not be held in check much longer

  youve been away three years bob
and we havent seen much of each other
since you returned i know very little
about you and you know less about me
you dont know what bad habits i might
have developed in three years she
said it seriously but he laughed at her
he had confidence enough for both

  are you trying to tell me that you
smoke they say most of the girls do
nowadays and t suppose i could over-
come an old-fashioned prejudice

  its worse than that she told him
calmly

  he raised his brows you dont
drink you refused a cocktail to-day
suppose i told you that i wasnt
honest 

  i wouldnt believe you honest
why you were morbid on that subject
when we were kids that possibility
did not worry him

  and yet it is true bob i wanted to
look well to-day i knew that this would
probably be our last chance of being
alone together and when i came to town
tliis morning i was very unhappy i
was going to lunch with you in shabby
left-over-from-the-summer things you
might be ashamed of me-you surely
would be if we happened to run into any
of your smart friends you think a lot
about appearances bob even more than
you used to you judge by them and
you would have judged me had t ap-
peared in my old straw hat i needed a
new one terribly but even if things were
not so bad with father i couldnt have
aspired to anything as smart as this
she put up a finger and touched the brim
of the velvet toque

  bob had listened with growing amaze-
ment now as she paused apparently
expecting him to say something he
spoke do you mean to say you bor-
rowed the hat for the occasion well
its mighty becoming and i wish youd
get your friend to let you buy it i dont
suppose it cost a fortune and id like to
have you wear it when were married
im not an utter fool i dont judge you
by your hat that isnt the only thing
that opened my eyes to the true state of
my feelings butit did help and you
must care a little for me otherwise you
wouldnt have wanted to look well for
my sake i know how proud you are
and it must have hurt to borrow a hat
he was very tender toward her as it
came to him that she must love him
dearly to humiliate herself in order to
shine in his eyes

  you dont understand florence
went on steadily i didnt borrow the
hat from a friend

  it isnt paid for you had it
charged he could well imagine that
with florences sensitive nature running
into debt would seem like dishonesty to
her

  no i stole it

  florence the horror he felt
showed in his face

  her own grew ghastly but her voice
was still calm now you see how little
you know about me the desire to
make a good appearance was stronger
than my old notions of right and wrong
i put on the hat and walked out of the
shop with it there are two entrances
and no one saw me she was finding a
certain relief in confession though it
cut off all hope of any happiness for her
in the future

  he was full of concern for her but
my dear think of the risk you ran
manlike that was the most important
thing to him

  t think i intended to return it though
i dont know whether t should have
told the truth and i used to be truth-
ful as well as honest so you see how
ive changed the bitter note in her
voice was for herself not for him she
could not expect bob to overlook such a


breezy stories

heinous offence against conventions
she almost wished that she had not told
him that she had simply refused him
and let him go with a tender memory of
her in his heart now he would take
away the darkest kind of a recollection

  it took bob a whole minute to readjust 
his point of view florence he began
gently well go first to the shop and
straighten matters there and then well
go down to city hall and get our li-
cense

  she stared at him her breath coming
quickly from between her parted lips
you want to get me out of the scrape
that way oh no bob i couldnt marry
you now the words tripped over
themselves in their eagerness to be said

  you cared enough to do a thing like
this and you were honest enough to
confess it do you think id let a girl
as brave as you are get away from me
he was sure of himself now and a note
of mastery crept into his voice

  it wasnt bravery it was despera-
tion she confessed

  your love went as deep as that he
reminded her

  a love that would descend to theft
she scorned herself and yet she longed
for his vindication

  hush dont say it he put his
hand over hers and held it in a clasp
that was warm and possessive come
flo dear well drive down to the city
hall in a taxi and perhaps therell be a
chance when the chauffeur isnt looking
for me to tell you properly that i love
you

  you cant bob she protested tear-
fully

  oh but i do the hat may have
started it but the girl herself finished
it

  somehow his words carried convic-
tion and florence raised her eyes to
meet his and saw that they were full
of a deep love that silenced her doubts
forever

the bush-rats and the small
busy things that come out at
night had ceased their scam-
pering through the dead leaves
patched with moonlight the silent can-
yon became ghastly unreal terrifying
it was the hour before dawn and the
mystery and the loneliness and the un-
broken quiet oppressed me and affright-
ed me and yet thrilled me all night
i had lain awake among those sleep-
ing ones beside me-awake with no one
to hinder my thoughts my brain was
as clear as the lovely sky and all that
i have been and all that i might have
been passed before my wide-open eyes

  loosening the grip on the small au-
tomatic pistol i had held for hours i
stretched my cramped fingers and as
the muscles relaxed so the tension in
my breast gave for an instant

  i looked at my friends

  the ashy light streaming through the
oak tree which spread above us re-
vealed in a hideous manner the faces of
the sleepers beneath there was some-
thing repulsive in the placidity of their
expressions in the inertness of their
tired bodies and very carefully lest the
movement disturb them i drew myself
stiff and aching from lying on the
ground so long from under the robes
and sat hunched up my arms encircling
my knees watching the sleepers and
wondering how they could rest while so
tortured a soul cried out its pain

  and then most unwillingly i turned
to my lover and was startled at the pal-
lid horror the moonlight made of his
fat boyish face

  there were five of us-three men and
the woman and myself-lying on a piece
of tarpaulin staked to the ground we
had been on a hunting trip and had lost
our way so we were forced to spend
the night in the canyon we had taken

of the hand

 forrest

 the cushions from the automobile and
 used them for pillows it was very un-
 comfortable yet they slept like children
 drawing heavy breaths the woman
 whining a little because she had gone to
 sleep afraid

   and i who had mocked her fears
 scornfully laughingly had lain awake
 all night grasping my pistol while i lis-
 tened to the pad of animal feet in the
 undergrowth and often as the sound
 came near raised on my elbow peering
 into the brush ready to shoot though
 why i who wanted to die should have
 been afraid i do not know but i was
 afraid my heart thudded heavily
 every little rustle startled me every
 shadow became a living thing i ex-
 pected i knew not what and i writhed
 in the clutch of a palpitant unseen and
 terrifying force that gripped my soul
 and my heart and squeezed them dry of
 every thought save fear

    i glanced across my lover at the lame
 boy slumbering beside him his thin
 tragic face upturned topped by a knit-
 ted cap with a tassel he looked like
 a dead brownie and i thought he be-
 longed there-in the pale moonlight
 among the leaves

   there was a bond of sympathy be-
 tween us the boy with the twisted back
 and dragging leg and i with my distort-
 ed past and my uncertain future

   shuddering i turned to the woman
 huddled at my right she was stout
 with a good-natured face that was al-
 most childish in repose she lay on one
 side her back to me an arm thrown
 across the shoulders of her husband
 who lay beside her he was sleeping
 the deep sleep of physical exhaustion

    while i sat there a shadow fell over
 the canyon and glancing up t saw that
 a lot of strange leaden clouds were
 creeping toward the moon which was
	breezy stories

hanging low in the sky i got up very
cautiously and looked down the trail
a sound like a thin-toned elfin voice
running through the grass came to me
and i knew it was time for me to go
as i had planned during the night

  some twenty paces away on the edge
of a creek was an old water-trough
almost hidden by the branches of a
scrub oak there was a deep boarded
well beside it the boards were rotten
and evil-smelling the water was cov-
ered with skippers and leaves seepage
from this spring trickled into the creek
and oozed sluggishly down the canyon
ending in a stagnant pool

  backing slowly toward the trail and
holding the pistol with a painful grip

i kept my eyes on the face of my lover
-the half-grown man for whom i had
given up my dear little boy and my hus-
band and my home yet after all did
i give them up for him or to satisfy
my own selfish desires had i been
urged to go perhaps i might blame him

i had gone of my own free will in a
moment of utter weariness and hysteria
and i had known once the step was
taken there could be no turning back
the home meant nothing to me nor
my husband-but ah my baby my
tender-limbed sweet-voiced little boy
the day i left him he was sitting on
his rocking-horse on the sidewalk in
front of the bungalow through a mist
of tears i shall see him always his
pretty yellow hair lifted by the wind
and his black eyes sparkling like dia-
monds-riding away as hard as he could 
clutching the reins with his fat little
fists his face dimpling with smiles as
he called good-by to me and so i
let him ride out of my life brighter
than the sunshine the sweetest thing in
the world and i had plunged blindly
into the darkness that losing him meant

  as i crept down the trail i saw him
riding before me in a path of silver
light and i heard the gurgle of his
laughter as he turned and smiled over
his shoulder at me but when t thought
i had reached him and would have
clasped him in my arms i stooped to
find only a cluster of moon-flowers at
my feet

  again my heart was chilled with
fright starting at every shadow at
every sinister crackling in the brush i
rushed madly through the brambles and
shrubs scarcely daring to look where i
went lest i meet the eyes i felt all about
me gleaming like balls of fire until a
sharp turn brought me to the tarn lying
under a huge overhanging boulder and
darkened by trees a mist dripping
from the gray moss wavered over the
pool and the unholy silence of the reed-
shadowed waters thrilled my soul with
horror

  it was a lonely spot that unlovely
anti evil swamp with its melancholy drip
of tears its unseen eyes its words for-
ever unspoken

  stumbling across the slimy roots of
dead trees roots that groped like tired
work-gnarled hands among the reeds and
sunk with desperate clutch into the black
water i peered into the dismal pool and
in the light of the veiled moon saw my
white face gleaming there

  what a pitiful face

  surely that was not my face-that
pallid drawn and haunted thing it
was my sorrow-stricken lost soul which
i saw for the first time

  as i leaned there wondering shrink-
ing from what i saw leering back at
me out of the dew-wet moss-hung and
dead trees-like figures of despair in the
pale glow-a little hoot owl flitted over
the water and passed darkly across the
moon

  then i remembered why i had come

  raising the awful weight of my body
so that i knelt on the edge of the pool
i released the safety catch on the pistol
pressed the muzzle over my heart and
pulled the trigger

  the hammer fell with a click

  i pulled the trigger again

  once more the hammer fell with a
click

  vainly i tried to eject the cartridge
but only succeeded in jamming it the
pistol had notbeen fired or cleaned for
years and it was quite useless t had
failed to carry out my last act of cow-
ardice and i the thief who had stolen
from her own little son who had pan-
dered her soul and made herself a fugi-
the pilgrim to bohemia



tive from happiness knew i would never
try it again overcome with rage i
twisted the pistol in my trembling hands
then leaping to my feet flung it into the
pool the filthy water splashed into
my face from all about the frightened
birds fluttered in the trees the small
animals disturbed by the commotion
scurried wildly through the brush but
unheeding i walked slowly up the trail
and reaching the spring again found my
friends still sleeping as when i left
them

  sick at heart i fell against the oak
sheltering the well and as i pressed
close to the rough trunk a faint
rustling solmd filled the canyon as
though a mighty hand had grasped the
trees and shaken them gently and the
ground trembled undulated slightly then
rocked violently staring upward i
wondered if those huge overhanging
boulders would loosen and come hurtling
upon us but before i could move or call
out the trembling ceased the leaves
shivered a little and were motionless
their frightened whispering sounding far
down the canyon where perhaps the

hand was passing on and the cloud
which had hidden the moon for an in-
stant floated lazily up to join those other
leaden ones that had gathered thickly
there was no sound no stirring of the
wind no light save the ashy glow from
the half-veiled moon-just the dull
breathless pause that precedes and fol-
lows an earthquake

  overwhelmed by the mystery of that
earthquake at dawn in the far-away can-
yon cowed by that unseen presence with
which i had battled throughout the
night i too felt the weight of the hand
and knew that as its grasp is powerful
so is it also relentless

  while i stood there crushed by the
knowledge that i must travel on to the
end of the journey i had mapped out
for myself yet enthralled by the terror
and the beauty of the night the cloud
drifted away from the moon and the
canyon was drenched with a cold silver
light

  the lame boy stirred and lifted his
head we looked at each other and he
smiled a little wistfully

ii	a nd concluded the doctor as
 the climax to an already for-
  midable list of prohibitives
you are tuberculous you
must not marry

  but protested deering rather
blankly im engaged

  the doctor remained unmoved break
your engagement he said decisively

  deering fumbled with his hat a mo-
ment you see doctor he said im
not only engaged but-

  what volunteered the doctor
kindly

  in love

  particularly if you are in love an-
swered the older man

  deering was silent there seemed
nothing he could do or say the doc-
tor leaned over his desk and wrote pre-
scriptions when he was finished deer-
ing spoke again

  are you sure doctor  is this final 
do you mean that i wont ever be
able- dee rings voice trailed off and
the doctor ruminated

  of course he began slowly in time
you may outgrow this weakness but just
now it wouldnt do it wouldnt be fair
to the girl its pretty tough particu-
larly as it isnt your fault in any way
but there it is

  yes there it was deering put the
prescriptions in his pocket and left the
office on the street a hurtling decem-
ber wind caught him and left him shiv-
ering on the curbstone the air was
filled with snow flurrying in nasty vi-
cious little squalls it drove against him
maliciously as though it bore him a per-
sonal grudge deering decided not to
take a car but bent his head and walked
head-on against the storm-block after
block in his brain the doctors dictum

  x ou must not marry kept hashing in
a monotonous recurrence

  and then he began to think of her
strangely enough-or perhaps naturally
-up to now it was only of himself that
he had thought that he must lose her
that he must step aside and give her up
that his life would be lonesome very
unhappy his own sense of loss was all
of which he had been conscious and
now he began to wonder how she would
take it it would be a great shock to
her everything had been arranged she
had his ring cards had been sent out
but people recover from shocks she
would give him back his ring the cards
would be recalled and she would be
free-free-that started a new train
of thought opened a new vista of possi-
bilities helen was very pretty alto
gether desirable others would court
her of course and not immediately
but a few moments afterward it oc-
curred to deering that she might accept
one of these others before he could
check it came an overmastering impulse
not to tell her of his trouble to keep her
in spite of everything but it passed as
quickly as it came leaving behind it a
sense of shame

  finally he reached the drug-store as
he told the clerk to hurry the prescrip-
tions he felt the fatuity of his desire for
haste of his having the prescriptions
filled at all since the medicine held out
no hope either of health or happiness

  at the candy counter he bought her
favorite brand he never came now
without bringing her a half-pound box
to-night he bought a pound the sin-
gularity of the aberration struck him
but he did not attempt to justify or even
to explain it

  from the drug-store to her house was
only a short space but the streets were
so thickly covered with snow and the
wind blew so fiercely that he made but
slow progress besides he was not in
pals



a hurry he felt none of the customary
impatience to see her he was thinking
rapidly walking very slowly so lost
in thought was he that he was uncon-
scious of the fact that his left hand
which he could not get into his overcoat
pocket full with the candy-box was
freezing how shall i tell her he was
asking himself and then how will
she take it

  he rang the bell the regulation num-
ber of times instantaneously followed
the click-click of the opened door he
looked up as he entered and saw her
come out to wait for him on the third
landing-a slim crisp figure in a white
shirtwaist and dark skirt clearly outlined
against the streaming light from the
room behind her he climbed the stairs
slowly as a rule he rushed up three
steps at a time but to-night he climbed

  how slow you are she laughed as
she kissed him its so cold standing
here and i was so impatient

  he kissed her and hung his coat on
the rather decrepit hat-tree im warm
enough he said smiling at her ive
walked twenty blocks

  he took the box of candy from his
overcoat pocket and gave it to her

  my nightly tribute he said still
smiling

  she acknowledged it brightly your
k-n-i-g-h-t-l-y tribute she responded
pleased with her own cleverness

  im a sorry knight he said as he
seated himself wearily in the only arm-
chair where he always sat she busied
herself with the candy-box berating him
for his extravagance

  i cant allow these lavish favors
frank youll want to take me to the
opera next im going to make this last
so you wont have to bring me any to-
morrow night i wont allow you to
spend your income on candy particu-
larly as after a certain date it will be my
income

  but its your candy he rallied

  as between income and candy i vote
for income my business training hasnt
gone for nothing frank

  he looked at her as she stood there
taking a bon-bon from its bright tin-
foil wrapping she was very pretty

very dainty-her small nimble hands
her slender round throat her smooth
thickly-coiled hair and a quick longing
for her came over him with the poignant
consciousness that she was not for him
that he must not even now get up from
his chair to take her in his arms

  she saw him looking at her quietly
laid down the sweets and approached
him

   frank she said slowly whats the
matter

  it was a moment before he answered
her its all off helen he finally said
whats all off

   everything-the little flat the trip
to washington the quiet little dinner for
just a few friends-everything

   tell us about it friend frank she
said gently

   so he told her and she listened not
once did she interrupt he finished with
the words of the doctor that in the un-
certain future it might be possible for
them to marry but that just now it was
out of the question

   she grasped eagerly at the poor straw
did he say that frank did he em-
phasize it did he

   the mans voice was hopeless

  no he didnt it was only a bluff
i guess theres no way out of it
helen i cant have you ive got to
give you up-ive got to

  something in his face almost fright-
ened her and decided her-gave her
courage for what in that instant she
had made up her mind to do

but frank dear she said softly
supposing i wont let you give me up
he did not understand im hoping
it wont be so very hard for you that
youll forget-

   but if i dont want to forget

  he showed his bewilderment she
pushed a chair squarely in front of him
and talked in a prim voice

  let me explain a horrid doctor
tells you you must not marry you see
a loop-hole for escape but i refuse to
let you escape-

  but helen-

   its very simple i shall not deprive
noble and ltnderwood of my valuable
services as stenographer you will con-

tinue adding accounts for a contaminated
food-concern you will not marry me
nor shall i let you marry any one else
nor will i marry any one else-even as-
suming that there should be any one as
foolish as you to wish to-dont you
see do you think im going to let you
go away and forget all about me well
stick together just as a ijew weeks from
now i would have promised to-and
perhaps some day we ll get a little flat
of our own and the trip to washington
and-

  her head fell forward on his breast
he bent his over her hair and laid his
hands gently on her quivering shoulders

  finally she rose and looked at him
ashamedly through her tears

  im a cry-baby she confessed

  youre a darling he denied

  and so they talked through the even-
ing-making new plans breaking all the
old ones it was settled-she wras to go
on working as she had been doing the
order at the printers for wredding cards
was to be remanded-they were to be
pals living always in the hope that the
future might bring the realization of past
dreams

  when they had said good-night for
the last time they shook hands for
they were not to be as lovers now but
friends

  when i came here to-night he said
i shuddered to look ahead now im
happy more than happy because i
know you love me

  and  too she said

  are you happy dear

  wonderfully happy and seeing
the brightness of her smile he could not
doubt it

  he went downstairs she turned and
walked slowly back into the room for
a moment her hands mechanically fin-
gered the box of candy on the table
then she fell on her knees to the floor
sobbing bitterly

  they grew quite used to it during the
next year it was rather sweet their
friendship-their calm quiet little talks
their modulated laughter the unruffled
depth of their understanding it was as
though they were two old people helen

sometimes thought two old people who
had loved in their youth passionately
parted and then come back to each other
after many many years-subdued chas-
tened by life disenchanted but not em-
bittered it seemed to helen just like
that the time when they had loved as
young people love seemed to her far
away frank seemed to her a past lover
not a present one and the sobriety of
their meetings the new attitude they
took the mature way they talked now
about things led her to believe that she
was in truth much older than her years
that for her the love of youth was no
more not because she made a conscious
effort to suppress it but because the de-
sire for it was somehow gone-as though
time had taken it away

  yret she was delicate enough not to let
frank see the growth of this involun-
tary indifference to the physical side of
their relationship for she could tell
sometimes by the way he looked at her
by his manner of touching her that for
him she was the same as she had always
been-a girl to be desired this trou- 
bled her she wished him to feel as she
did-as old as settled as removed from
the tempestuous silly temptations
which young people are commonly lured
by for her part she fancied herself free
of them forever-this tempered creature
of twenty-four

  as for him after the first month or
two when his disappointment was still
new when the pain of renunciation was
yet fresh it was easy for him to regard
her as a sainted creature before whom
it wras only fitting to bow down to touch
reverently was she not scarificing her-
self for him-sacrificing everything
but after a time it began to seem to
him that it only could be so loving
him what else could helen do and he
began to think of her again as the crea-
ture of flesh whom he adored he began
to hope to look forward to the time
when she would be his as she had before

it was only by the exercise of great con-
trol that he met her  the plane they
had decided-pals friends who met
each other to talk to be as she put it
sensible and she discerning this
weakness in him feared increasingly the
pals

time when he would sweep aside the
fragile limitation they had ringed about
each other that she felt would spoil
everything for she herself sie felt
with a proud sadness was now beyond
temptation she thought desire had left
her when in truth it was only desire for
him that she was free of

  and then biuyr noble newly grad-
uated from the law-school came into his
fathers office to stay she had seen him
many times before-he would come in
during the holidays go into the room
marked private where his father sat
come out smiling into everybodys faces
and go away again once he had said
good morning to her it was a spring
day and he was sailing for europe-he
had been evidently in a jody mood a
tall chap he was with frank eyes a lot
of lint curly hair and an easy swing-
ing gait he had never seemed to her
a reality somehow-she thought of him
when she thought of him at all as a
half-mythical creature whom it would be
absurd to consider in a personal rela-
tion-as though he were a figure in a
plav or a character in a book

  and now he came into the office where
site aw him every day he dictated
most of his letters to her he would
bug at the droll things she said the
got on nicely	

   ne day when she had finished some
work for him he asked whether he
might take her to dinner she told him
she was engaged though she did not add
to he married he apologized after
that be seemed constrained in his man-
ner toward her and she saw a good deal
less of him that night though as she
and frank were sitting together in her
stuffy little parlor frank reading some-
thing elevating aloud to her the thought
crept into her head  i might be out with
billy noble to-night-  and in spite of
anything she could do the thought
stuck

  about five oclock one afternoon a few
months later she and noble were alone
in his office he was in the midst of
dictating a brief when he suddenly asked
with entire irrelevance miss leighton
when are you going to be married 



   i dor t know she answered looking
at him fairly

  you told me you were engaged-

   im not exactly engaged i was
but-

  its broken oft  he asked otrctlv

  no-it isnt

  you are engaged and youre not
youre talking in riddles

  so she told him that frank was ill
tha he might get well but it was doubt-
ful that he loved her that she meant
a great deal to him and there she
stopped

  billy noble got up and squeezed her
hand lying idly on the desk in front of
her

  youre a brick he said and casu-
ally be asked lier to go to dinner-in a
way that it would have seemed foolish

to refuse

  it was a very iolly dinner she found
herself laughing outright-something she
never did now when she was with frank
and billy was very interesting-hed
been to so many places and knew so
many things when dinner was over he
asked her to go to the theatre with him
her face darkened he wanted to know
why she couldnt come

  i must hurry home she said
frank is coming to see me

  and when may i comer

  she began pulling on her gloves rap-
idly he reached his hand across the
table and closed it over hers-glove and

an

  frank comes every evening she
said

  he looked into her eyes youre a
nice little girl he said but very fool-
ish

  that night when frank came shas
very unhappy she felt vaguely pity
-as though she had been faithless to
him and he irritated her slightly too-
he would touch her face and her shoul-
ders finally she had to ask him rather
sharply to be sensible but he looked
so hurt so unhappy that a qualm of re-
morse swept over her and she kissed him
swiftly-for the first time in months
he misunderstood and grasping her to
him pressed his lips to hers passionately
you darlingt he whispered you

darling-she had to struggle to free
herself-she was white with anger

 but- he mumbled brokenly i
dont understand-you-

  of course you dont she half
sobbed youve spoiled everything
apd she swept out of the room leaving
him miserable but on the way home
figured it out that she was probably ill
and he determined to act the next day as
though nothing had happened

  helen was very angry she felt al-
most outraged

  that was it-the very word that
frank should thus intrude into the beau-
tiful calm of their friendship with an
emotion crass and earthly it was dis-
illusioning why could he not be like
herself-purged of the weaknesses of the
flesh rarefied etherealized by this trou-
ble that had come to them-poor
helen

  the next night she told frank that he
must not met it happen again and
frank promised but the next night it
did helen was furious and did not let
him see her for over a week when she
did he was humble apologetic

  you promised- she began

  yes he admitted i promised
  well

you were close to me and i-forgot
you shouldnt forget she said a bit
mildly her aggressiveness softened by
the almost comic meekness of his expres-
sion

  after all she continued its hard
for me too-

  is it he asked eagerly

  of course

  you brave little girl and instead
of helping you i make it harder after
this youll find me strong too

  and there they dropped it nothing
helen could have said would have been
better calculated to keep their relation
just as she wished it her confession
that she too was a prey to temptation
was pleasing to franks vanity and bol-
stered his weakness but helen was
only partly pleased for when she ad-
mitted that it was hard for her she knew
that she deceived him that he imag-
ined she missed his demonstrations of

affection she began to fancy she had
done with that part of love

  but as to this she was soon disillu-
sioned being a clear-headed and ana-
lytical little person she became conscious

his showing unmistakably the tremen-
dous though unexpressed admiration he
had for her

  helen was not unschooled or uncon-
scious had she not been for nearly a
year engaged to a man but she chose
to ignore these manifestations of his in-
terest-loves antennae-on the principle
that to openly resent them would be em-
barrassing and in bad taste then it
came to her suddenly like a shock that
she didnt really mind them and merci-
lessly her concise business-like little
brain forced her to admit even more-
that she liked them that was danger-
ous helen was sober-minded and hon-
est with herself she decided not so
much that billy noble was dangerous
as that she was in danger and being
essentially discreet as well as honest not
belonging to that variety almost exclu-
sively feminine which emulates in mor-
als a standard analogous to that of the
marksman who measures his skill by the
surprising closeness with which he can
come to his target without actually hit-
ting it she decided that the best thing she
could do was to tell billy noble that she
wouldnt see him again outside the beaten
way of business but when she did tell
him so he laughed

  all right he had said where
shall we go to-night

  and when he saw that she meant it
really meant it he forced a compromise
pie must see her once more just once
a hail and farewell to their friendship

  she capitulated

  very well she said once more
but the last time-the very last-

  they went to dinner

  sitting opposite her in evening clothes
he was pleasant to look at frank had
been looking thin lately and seedy try
as she might she could not keep these

as she saw billy aoble more and more
that she took a pleasure in his presence
he  quite apart from the mere innocent de-
light of companionship perhaps this
realization came indirectly as a result of
pals



little comparisons from cropping up

  but after a moment the music the
good food the pleasant surroundings of
the restaurant and billys jolly talk
made her forget frank she gave her-
self up completely to the fun of the
moment was it not the last time

  he was in a rare humor like a college-
boy on a lark

  now he said that i know this is
the last time i am going to see you i may
say anything i like to you maynt i  i
may even make violent love to you tell
you how beautiful you are-all that sort
of thing-

  of course not for you zcill see me
again-in the office

  my dear child he said patronizingly
we are here solemnly and finally bury-
ing our friendship these ill have you
understand are funeral-baked meats
if you think for a moment that after to-
night i am going to continue being your
devoted slave you are much mistaken
in future you are to me an automaton a
fixture a creature who is paid to do my
bidding from eight in the morning till
five in the evening-in short my stenog-
rapher

  all right she said smiling thats
fine just what i want

  remember-no overtures no furtive
meaningful glances over your typewriter
not a vestige of familiarity for i warn
you-you will find me glacial unre-
sponsive

  some one might think that i had been
flirting with you

  you havent ive gallantly saved
you the trouble but in the future-
behold me the merciless employer of la-
bor the unfeeling taskmaster you he
emphasized are labor i proudly am
the taskmaster in the future i devote
my life to browbeating labor

  thank you for pointing out with
painful clearness my humiliating posi-
tion mr noble but what would the
taskmaster do if he found that labor had
asked mr underwood as a special fa-
vor to allow her to do his work and send
miss gaunet over to you a change
miss gaunet and mr underwood would
both appreciate

  what would the taskmaster do

  yes

  he would fire miss gaunet and her
successors till he got the labor he
wanted

  thank you

  dont mention it

  they laughed they were having a
very good time

  suddenly his face grew serious  tell
me he asked why wont you see me
again-just like to-night whats up
st helena it was his whim to call her
that

  but his question brought a troubled
look into her face and he reached out
his hand and took hers

  never mind-dont tell me-i dont
care to know because i know you uau
see me again-and then some

  i wont she said stoutly too
stoutly

  all right he said well talk it
over-after the show

  it was a very funny show about a
man who was going to divorce his wife
but ran away with her instead to a
certain way-side inn and fell in love
with her ali over again

  helen and billy enjoyed it immensely
when something very funny happened
they would clutch each others hands
with the joy of it all

  when the play was over they walked
down the cool bright street laughter
still clinging to their lips but by de-
gree they quieted and walked along
without talking her face quite serious
almost wan and he with a little rem-
nant of smile still playing about his
mouth

  he asked her whether she wanted to
go anywhere and she said she would
rather go right home-if he didnt mind
he didnt usually he would have
pressed her but to-night for some rea-
son he didnt seem to care

  she was thinking what a delightful
evening it had been and that it was the
last she wondered what he was think-
ing-

  what are vou smiling at she asked

  at you

 why

  you take things so seriously


breezy stories

 what for instance

 why me

 dont you want to be taken seri-
 ously 

 not if it means youre not going to
 let me take you out any more

 she was silent a moment supposing
 he knew-that the reason she wasnt go-
 ing to let him see her any more was be-
 cause she was afraid

 you dont understand was all she
 said

 youre a great little girl he an-
 swered irrelevantly

 that was all they said till they
 reached the house

 shall i walk upstairs with you he
 asked as they entered the hallway

 if you like she said

 perfunctory but we are thankful for
 small favors

 they climbed the dim stairs he two
 steps at a time so that he reached the
 top ahead of her he was like a little
 boy she thought half-wist fully

 im so tired she breathed as they
 reached her door

 of course im going he said cheer-
 fully

 the play was wonderful thank
 you

 im not the author he laughed

 she gave him her hand and he
 squeezed it

 thank you again mr noble for
 all the nice times youve given me
 good night

 good night he said good-naturedly
 and he continued to hold her hand

 or perhaps since i am not going to
 see you again in a-personal way we
 ought to say good-by

 good-by said billy leaning com-
 fortably against the door he was hold-
 ing her hand tightly in both his looking
 at her he thought she was the most
 feminine girl he had ever met

 well she finally said

 i think said he that i can see you
 to-morrow night after all

 billy-in her impatience she for-
 got to be formal-havent i told you
 once and for all-

 y ou see i did have an engagement
 he interrupted in firm but unruffled tones

but it occurs to me now that i can very
easily break it

  im not going to see you again ex-
cept in a business way-ever this with
a determined stamp of a slippered foot

  the question is ruminated mr no-
ble as though meditating aloud where
shall we go

  there was a pause billy-please-
you make it hard for me-

  he still held her hand and now he
drew jier close to him

  do you really mean that you dont
want to see me again-ever you know
i dont believe you do-really

  yes i do it isnt fair-to him
you refer i suppose to your friend
-the gentleman who has the habit of
being engaged to you

  you mustnt billy-

  hes a crum-

  she drew a wav from him

  billy-mr noble

  im sorry little saint but he is any
man wholl keep a girl tied to him just
because shes foolish enough to let him
is some crum believe me

  i wont listen-  she started for
the door but found him facing her

  yes you will he said firmly ive
started and im going to finish it seems
a rotten thing to do to knock a man to
a girl behind his back but its been on
my chest a long time and im going to
get it oft in a moment of sentimental
impulse you promised this chap youd
stick to him through thick and thin it
was a nice impulse and i appreciate the
spirit that prompted it only a little
saint like you would have had it but
it wont stand against a little cold think-
ing- come now-admit the absurdity of
the whole business like the sensible little
lady you are

  ill admit no such thing supposing
frank hadnt found out till-till after
we were married wouldnt it have
been my place then to stand by him no
matter what happened-wouldnt it
but luckily you werent married and
you werent under any such obligation
the contract wasnt signed

  a lawyers argument of course
frank had my word i loved him
oh you loved himv
two

p

 lo

r

     i do still

    he stood very close to her

   do you do you

    of course i do

   he took her face between his
   palms and made her look up at him

   why do you stick to him you
   know you dont love him you can t

 whatever it is that you feel for him it
    isnt love a girl like you cant love a
    man who is weak tell me helen  it
    means something to me too you know-
    a great deal-

   he needs me billy- was all she
   said there was a long pause

    all right little saint youre the
 boss

good-by billy

since this is good-by-let me kiss
ou once-will you ive wanted to-
ots-

no billy she said softly it
   wouldnt be right

   on the forehead-a sacramental
   kiss-

    he did so-and in a moment the dark-
    ness everything seemed to close in on
    them sending them into each others
    arms-

    late the next afternoon sitting miser-
    able and dry-eved alone in her room
    helen was still thinking of herself and
    her emotions of the night before she
    loved frank and yet under the other
    mans kiss she had forgotten every-
    thing    how was she to account for
    it for as she sat there she realized
    how madly billys kiss had stirred her

   then a messenger came with a note
   from the man who liad held her so ar-
   dently in his arms the night before

   i know now that you love me it
   ran i am glad-glad-because i love
   you youve got to give the other man
   up and marry me

    and that night jubilant frank came
    to see her the doctor had removed the
    ban against his marriage

    he could not understand her apathy
    helen he cried you dont seem
    to understand- its lifted-the terri-
    ble load are you ill helen you dont
    seem to understand

pals



  yes dear i understand and i am
-glad but i have something-to tell
you-

  he was dulled by her attitude

  i expected you to be so happy- he
complained

  for a moment it struck her that she
need not tell him why after all should
she dampen his happiness perhaps in-
deed spoil it why not wrap herself
 the shelter his love offered her had
she not earned the right to anything
he had to give by her devotion when
his future seemed hopeless if only she
could be more sure of herself

  he caught her swaying and rested
her in the big chair

  what is it dear youre ill helen
she brushed a hand over her eyes

  no frank-im not ill-sit down
frank with her foot she pushed a
chair in front of hers i have some-
thing to tell you

let it wait dear youre not well
no frank this cant wait if i
dont tell you now it might get to be
too strong for me-i might get so i
wouldnt tell you at all-

  all right he said gaily wliat of
it dear what difference does any-
thing make now cant you see how
happy i am i dont want to hear the
old thing

  yes you do frank she said slowly
well if you insist-fire ahead 
they sat facing each other a few mo-
ments-she leaning far back in the big
chair he bending forward eagerly his
hands clasping hers in her lap their
knees touching

  i hardly know how to begin she
said wearily its so terribly-funny
i cant realize it-myself

  he waited for her to continue some-
thing in the expression of her face kept
him silent

frank she began when you told
me of your illness i said it wouldnt
make any difference between us-that
id keep on-loving you-just the same
you dear-

  dont interrupt me-please-till im
through i was willing to stick to you
for good i meant to be faithful to you
till vou got better-and if you didnt-


breezy stories

if yoa didnt get better-to stick any-
way-always-

 darling-youre pale-you ought to
 be in bed-

 im going to finish frank i meant
 to stick squarely to you and i tried-
 honestly-

 and you did-bless you

 no-i didnt

 what do you mean helen

 some one has fallen in love with
 me frank she half smiled

 and you he asked quickly

 i told him i was engaged-to you
 well r

 he didnt believe it somehow i
 couldnt convince him that i was in love
 with you and not with him

 you encouraged him you let him
 see you  did you  sharply the ques-
 tions came like the interrogatory crackle
 of the cross-examiner

 you must be easy with me frank
 forgive me helen- he paused
 now tell me all about it and well drop
 it-the whole thing-perhaps it was too
 much to expect you to spend all your
 spare time with an invalid in spite of
 himself his voice stiffened with irony
 she did not seem to notice

 whats happened helen he asked
 tersely and as she did not answer
 are you in love with this man

 no i dont think so-i like him
 but-

 youve been seeing him

yes

 encouraged him

 no i tried not to i told him last
 night-

 you saw him last night

 it was to be the last time he asked
 me to let him see me once more and
 last night-

 you told him you wouldnt see him
 any more after last night

 yes

 then he said brusquely well con-
 sider the matter closed

 but frank she said looking
 straight at him last night-he kissed
 me i didnt love him and yet when he
 kissed me i forgot you-our engage-
 ment-everything-

  good god helen  the memory
of the year he had been denied her kisses
made him rage but you love me

  yes i thought i loved you-now i
am not so sure she was trying to
explain to herself not to him

  your love couldnt have been worth
much if it went to pieces under another
mans kiss frank was bitter

  frank dear dont condemn me i
shant see him again

  but youve shaken my faith in you-

i can never be sure of you again-

  helen looked up into his pain-twisted
face he seemed like a stranger to her
and she drew away from him

  i couldnt be sure of myself we
can never go on now frank its all at
end between us

  but he would not accept that he
pleaded with her in the name of their
old love but when he saw that it was
useless-he began to heap reproaches
upon her she had never cared-she
wasnt able to care to feel a deep senti-
ment-

  when he finally left her her heart
was very heavy and then suddenly billys
note gleamed white on top of her bureau

  in the gray twilight she read it-sev-
eral times

  and suddenly she understood it all
saw everything clcarly she had been
trifling with her real happiness her
affection for frank had been almost
sisterly that was why she had welcomed
the change from lover to pal but with
billy it was different her whole heart
had gone out to him

  billy how blind she had been

  billy why she loved him all this
time without knowing it she had loved
him and that was why his kiss had
thrilled her

  after a time she sat down and wrote
to him

billy dear

  you are right and i am glad-glad
-because i love you

helen

  and smiling joyously she brushed
away a tear

by robert p jule

as my rooming house was very
free and easy except in the
matter of rent in advance i
was not surprised when ger-
truda followed her knock and my invi-
tation into my bedroom

  i was very glad to see her since i had
been up for the last hour trying to make
up my mind to go out now of course
as gertruda and i were friends this
would be impossible

  i knew that something weighed upon
her mind by the heavy air with which
she lit a cigarette and sat down

  bill said she at last breaking the
silence that had grown so sombre that
it darkened the room in spite of the
eleven oclock sun

  yes gertruda

  do you know any honest work that
can be handled by a flapper of my figure
and magnetism  aint there no mani-
cure parlor that wants a dame that
knows when to hold hard to a mans
hand to keep it from going round her
waist 

  honest work gertruda

  i dont wonder youre scared bill
itd frighten any male to have a bear
with my innocent eyes look at him and
ask to be put hep to honest toil even
in a manicure parlor no t aint fixing
any game on you whats the use
but just now i got a yearn for my old
sheltered life when i was a telephone
girl i know about you and that mani-
cure dame if she is a true woman and
dont get a glimp of me shell put you
wise to some place where i could nestle
down an-

  but my dear its a hard life-even
with the tips

  im going said gertruda rising in
mysterious wrath tips

  but no woman ever went when she
said she was going so i waited for ger-
trudas next remark

  it came while she was trying to find
where her bag had gone

  gertruda enters a room in a shower
gloves one way bag another coat an-
other gertruda is a great trial to her
neat and orderly young husband slim
dick the well-known and much respect-
ed confidence man

  that there word makes me feel like
a female leopardess said gertruda as
she knelt to look under my bed damn
that bag now would you think a thing
like that could roll  but theres a hex
on me to-day i had to turn back for
my gloves and spoil the most withering
farewell and exit that i ever handed that
there husband of mine no bill come
to think of it its beneath my magnetism
to extract half a buck from some horny
hand that ive made to shine when the
same amount of personal charm chucked
at a real comeon has resulted in thou-
sands ive made up my mind to quit
being a crook but it dont follow that
i aint got pride enough not to care for
my former standing

  here she emerged panting dust on
the knees of her smart blue serge

  yes im hexed to-day its bad luck
to turn back once you get started espe-
cially if by doing so you give a man
a chance to edge in a word wed
scrapped for two hours before i could
feel sure i worked up an exit and still
left nothing unsaid then i had to go
back before the effect was even begun
to be wore off and that gave slim the
chance to hand me a remark that kept
me for an hour more yes im hexed
to-day but i dont care when men
have handed a dame of my tempera-

breezy stories

  brushing her knees times is aint you
  got a whisk broom bill when i wish
   was back in the womans stirr at oc-
  caquan	

    she sighed with memory of the prison
 that had once enclosed her graceful fig-
 ure and pretty face

    did i ever tellyou about the time
 i had the chaplain going there  he had
 to read slims letters to me say bill
 -her face rippled with smiles-he
 made the pardon board let me out quick
 on my indeterminate because he was
 afraid i was going to get him say a
 flapper has got a guy just where she
 wants him when the law makes him come
 to see her every time he has to give her
 a letter i will say that things is made
 easy for a lady when she gets into the
 stirr-that is in the personal magnetism
 line how many dames that can t sink a
 hook into a man without his cutting it
 right out but would take a two-spot for
 the right to lamp him with her sad beams
 through the bars of a cell you know
 at occaquan prisoners is allowed to re-
 ceive letters at all times slim wrote
 me most every day when i put him wise
 oh them was the happy times

    here she burst into tears and not be-
  ing able to remember what she had done
  with her handkerchief dried her eyes
  on the corner of the sheet

   what has happened gertruda i
 begged when her shoulders had ceased
to shake

    xothing except that the man i went
 to the trouble of marrying even when
 it was a risk for me to have my name
 wrote on a hotel register to say noth-
 ing of a certificate has went and played
 me traitor

   what has happened i repeated
 this time anxiously

    whats happened she cried bitterly
  oh nothing but what every married
  woman gets whether she expects it or
  not-the man i took the risk of going
  to court to have certified was my lawful
  husband and was gave a certificate that
  could be showed to any dame that gimme
  the top register laugh when i said so
  that man has-oh dont mind that tooth
  mug i had to break something heres
  a quarter

  gertruda picked up the fragments of
the wreck she had made of my cup and
put them carefully upon the washstand
 hen she said in a manner that would
have proved to any one that she had
once been on the stage

   im a ruined woman bill

  this appalling remark could only be
taken in one way-the worst

   gertruda i gasped you dont mean
to tell me youve lost your money
yes an worsern that bill
what

  ive lost my pride and ambition
that explains that remark that was
gave when i first came in the one about
wanting honest work

  would it do you any good to tell me
whats happened

   it wont do me no good nothing ever
can again except to see that there cer-
tified husband back in the class from
which i rose him-snatchin leathers
from working dames on a saturday
night-but oh bill bill to think that
the man that i lowered myself to go
and have stamped by the license bureau
as my property when the best he could
have expected would have been id have
let him come around when there wasnt
a chance of anybody high up in the pro-
fession droppin in to think of that
man-

   here she burst into tears and hid her
head in the pillow

   it struck me as a pity considering how
appealing and pretty she was in her grief
that i was not some old rich comeon
i am certain that gertruda at this mo-
ment could have extracted the gold fill-
ings from the teeth of mammon had she
wanted to

  there-there i soothed as i patted
her heaving shoulder tell me all about
it

well she sat up and dabbed her eyes
with the edge of the sheet it is some
relief for a dame to have a friendly
ear to hollar into it was this way-
wait till i give you a light

  oh bill a pill goes good with a
wrecked life why is it that only the
man a woman aint in love with is the
one who thinks of giving her them lit-
tle ladylike attentions which is so sooth-
the tip of temptation



ing when a woman has gave her heart
to a man all he does is ran for the meat
axe

  have a drink the bottle is in the
washstand

  no if i took to drink now there is
no telling what would happen and
though i have lost my husband i still got
my shape to consider you know about
that diamond necklace that i got with
the money that came from the game at
palm beach 

   yes

  well i banked it by hocking it and
raising a little on the ticket just enough
not to worry me if i wanted to get it
quick oh bill bill i really never wore
that necklace into society except just
once down to jakes and that at a hour
when any phony would have been took
for the goods say really they hadnt
until id yelled it all over the place
no more idea lhar  had eight thou-
sand around my neck than that im a
blonde by the gift of god thats what
comes of waiting too long to work up
an entrance the booze takes the centre
of the stage but say when a few of
them gents had had a chance to put
the glass on them sparklers youd
oughter have seen the success i was
before i left i had had my toes stepped
on under the table by frisco dan the
head of the profession and had had to
throw the newport kids arm from
round my waist three times-even that
didnt stop him until i put my arms
around his neck and bit a piece out of
his ear that made him yell till all the
bunch was really wise as to my feeling
for him youd cughter heard them give
him the laugh oh oh i only wore
them sparklers once-just once bill i
wish you had something more i could
break

  say how could i wear them lov-
ing my husband as i do and regard-
ing them as a bank account if id
kept them by me id have just been
wore out running to the jewelers to see
if slim had slipped in a phony on me
bill a husband and wife never had ought
to be in the same profession it leads
to jealousy jealousy professional jeal-
ousy is what has broke up our home

  you see it was all right when slim
looked up to me and was a learner but
no sooner had i got him really started
into a high-class crook than he begins
to have them feelings known to men
which same is that they are always to
lead the procession and a woman is to
follow carrying the water bucket in case
the sun should gel too hot

  we began to have mixes as to which
was the best crook now you know i
got a soft and shrinkin nature but there
is some things that i wont stand for
which same is holding back the hand
when ive done a good act and have a
right to my bows

  every time we done a trick we had a
mix him denying me my rights and
holding back on the hands that was due
me for my work then wed make up
oh bill aint women fools they let
men drag them round the loor and throw
them under the sink when all the time
what the act calls for is for them to
grab the nearest thing that a man can
understand when he gets it broke over
his dome i swear to gawd that two
people who weigh in about the same
figure should never get married theres
no peace in marriage until one or the
other has been gave a knockout other-
wise the fight goes to any number of
rounds and there cant be no decision

  she sighed

  well every time we pulled a game
instead of sitting down and being happy
we got up and hopped over the ropes he
handing me the blimin that hed thought
of it first or that it wouldnt have come
off but for his rushing in when i was
gumming the game and me the same
only backwards we had a dawgs life

  but in spite of that  was happy i
love a scrap besides i had got the habit
of slim ever since i first lamped him
buying drinks for a blooey blonde that
had oughter been grateful to slip her
leather into a mans pocket before she
ever left her front door slimmy was
paying think of it paying out real
money and him with them blue eyes of
his

  he knew i had the ticket for the
necklace but he knew too what instruc-
tions i had gave to the hock shop in case


breezy

stories

anybody came in with that ticket that
necklace worried him i admit id work
it on him sometimes not that if hed
needed it i wouldnt have gave it to
him-but it was our bank account slim-
my cant keep money no more than he
can keep his hands off it but i just
let him see that i was a woman with
her own money bill i sometimes think
it aint right for the wife to have the
money but if she dont have it neither
of them will you know men bill

  well as i said between the sparklers
and who was the best crook our flat
was just a place to come home and mix-
up in

  she turned to me and hit the pillow as
she demanded

  i ask you bill i ask you if there
aint more real art in a woman just using
her own face and shape and getting away
with every kind of a comeon from down
to whiskers than in a man who can
change his voice so you wont know it
and has got to use make-up to change
character i admtt that slims way of
shooting his voice around is clever-but
it aint art its slap-stick

  it certainly is

  well things went along as fierce as
ever until    bill why aint i got more
firmness had i have held back from
them eyes of slims when he just cant
make them behave after a row and
lamps the mad out of me with them blue
orbs and says lets forget it kid well
if id have put him on the pavement for
ten days to cool off hed have had more
respect for me

  but nobody can have no respect for
me now no wonder i am asking you
to put me wise to honest work   

  well all at once things quieted dow-n
slimmy dont come back at me when id
get into the ring to fight for my repu-
tation in fact he hands it to me with-
out ever weighing in quits at the ropes
id oughter have suspectcd

   bill why is it a woman cant never
be content she wants a man to keep
up the monologue once hes admitted
hes been wrong that was me gee
but i must have got on his nerves i
can see it all now too late

   here she used the corner of the sheet
again

  presently i quit making him admit
i was the star of the team because i
seen something about him i could not
make out i knew he had some game

   at first i thought it might be a dame
but he didnt manicure his nails enough
for that well i thought id just lay
low and see then bill he began to
read the papers

   hat  oh you mean the sporting
sheet i dont see anything in that
said i

  bill he was reading the war news
i don t mean the headlines sometimes
i look at them myself i mean the bat-
tles  and whether there was going to
be peace or not and if the kaiser was
about to croak thats what i mean
bill

  she meant a great deal if you knew
how absolutely the little world to which
slim and gertruda belong are absorbed
only in themselves you w-ould under-
stand

  naturally i got worried when
man takes to reading there is no telling
what will happen

  what did happen

  this one day he comes bounding
in and flashes a roll at me that would
croak a horse he hits the ceiling about
a million times before i could get a clinch
on him and hold him dowrn to know- if
i was to pack for a getaway

   bill you cant think how frightened
i was when he told me that hed made
that roll honest i thought he might
have hooked up with some millionaire
dame you know

  then he explains to me that what he
is showing me is only the edge of the
roll that hes getting rich by the min-
ute  that hes going to quit the crooked
game and live honest because he has
found a game that beats anything in the
con line-wall street

  well it took me five hours to get
what i can give you in three minutes
did you ever hear of them things they
call war babies i dont mean the kind
tliat would come anyway but that the
war is a grand excuse to account for i
mean the war stocks them things that
the tip of temptation



go up twenty-five points every time you
hear of em and aint in em

  ive heard of them i admitted
thinking of the riot of speculation then
smashing around wall street

  well he was in them-crunchable
steel

  my eyes widened crunchable steel

  well it seems he was getting rich
and i was getting nothing but the in-
formation it set me thinking espe-
cially as he shut up with a snap that
pinched my lingers every time i tried
to pry him open

  bill you cant think how i was wor-
ried id rather it had been a rich dame
than wall street-thered have been
some chance of gettin him back ive
had a lot to do with corneous that
were in the street and i know if he
had his own money what would be the
satisfaction to me i know the wives
of them wall street guys you know i
been on the stage  and i could make
a fine picture of me sitting in the wal-
dorf when slim had fixed things so i
could get in sitting there doing nothin
while some flapper was doin slim hon-
est i cried a quart

  it dont never soften a man to wet
him with tears bill though women can
never be got to think so any more
than you make em yearn for your so-
ciety by raising hell when you get em
alone but bill i was so worried here
was slim doing work he didnt need me
in and getting rolls that would come in
so fast hed have a new one before hed
lost the last bucking the wheel and never
needin to come broke to me in the morn-
ings for me to stake him    and how
did i know hed want to stay by me now
that he could afford his pick of natural
blondes 

  say i just yearned for that damned
crunchable steel to smash right then

  i had the faint hope that he was put-
ting some game on me to get at the neck-
lace until id put the roll under the glass
and seen that it didnt have no stake
mark on it

  let me explain that jake always has
in his safe a roll to supply when such
evidence is needed to prove to a come-
on that there is real money in the game

and that he has marked it so that if by
any chance it is lost he can trace every
dollar and exact vengeance jake is a
little suspicious though he should know
that with his connections no crook in
his wildest moments would dare spend
any of that money the dive keepers
would spot it if jake passed the tip
even as far as san francisco one of
jakes bills spent in a dive in chicago
resulted in the ending of the very prom-
ising life of fatty blanco no jakes
roll is safe

  but look here gertruda i said this
sounds queer to me still slim is too
noted a crook to be let go into wall
street or any of the brokerage offices
uptown as to the hotels he would not
dare show his face how did he work
it did you find out i may want to
take a little flier myself sometimes
where did he go to speculate did he tell
you 

  no but i found out for all that
the things a man wont tell his wife liell
tell a bartender next day i went to
jakes

  well jake wised me up to the fact
that it was texas ruby who had first
put slim onto the stock market texas
used to be a paying teller

  say i knew that if texas would wise
up my husband he would wise me twice
as fast honest bill i had been so
worried that not till then did it come to
me that there was no reason t shouldnt
get into the honest graft myself i was
a business woman even if my heart was
broke besides it was something to
have on slim

  it took just two cocktails for me to
get the whole game it seems that texas
had a friend that was kind to him for
the sake of old times he had a little
office where only the highest kind of a
crowd ever come-in fact they was so
high that they didnt come there hardly
at all just phoned him what to do he
was an operator the high old guy had
nfever seen a crook in his life didnt
suppose there was such things except in
prisons and such places oh texas said
he was way up

  and so he was about twenty floors

wen cant see nobody but by appoint-
ment

  you can imagine that got me me
setting there completely surrounded by
them trustful-looking books while texas
wrote a note to be sent in to the old guy
begging him to see me

  i was just faint with longin for him
to see me bill id wore my full crepe
mournin that had drawed to me more
than one cold calm heart because of the
wistful lines of my shape and my sweet
gentle pitiful face looking out so help-
less from the surroundings of my
widows veil i will say that crepe
brings out the natural tones of my hair
better than nothing i know

  but when at last i did get in to the
old guy i had the dreadful sinkin feeliu
that comes to a dame when her per-
sonality is throwed back onto her hard
he had unemotional whiskers and ter-
rible eyes the eyes of that man oh
them awful unhuman black eyes of that
there man  them rows of books oughter
gave me a sort of preparation for them
black orbs bill they was bad enough
as gawd had made em big and black
and borey but when is added them kind
of specks that makes eyes look three
times the size of nature it was just aw-
ful  bill even now them blade lamps
makes me shiver

  bill as i sat there tcllin him about
me bein left a widow with very little
money an how i didnt know what in

the world to do because id always had
a inan to depend on i had the most aw
fullest gone feeling about my magnetism
worse than that time i told you about
when i went up against the mormon an
got the shock of my life

  you never told me about that-

  it s one of them things in a womans
past that is best hid but speaking of
this guy with the orbs i had the feelin
that slim was right about not trustin
always to art and usin a little slapstick
to get an effect over i hada wish id
told jake to get me a baby to bring with
me but bill you know i do hate them
properties im known in the profession
as an artist an an artist has got to re-
spect her name

  yes indeed you are never crude
well the best i could draw outer
that guy after seven good tears had
rolled down my cheeks one after the
other i counted them that emotional
work always does bring the tears from
me i got such a temperament and id
turned my head so the light could glisten
on em the best i could get was the ad-
vice to hold hard to my money and not
trust to wall street

  bill that there cold throwoff just
got me goin i done the best emotional
work of my life right thft quiet but re-
fined you know but with a punch that
oughter have rung the bell on any mans
heart

  well i cant say as i was sure that
id rung the bell but i gathered that
i heard a faint tinkle when he told me
to go away and think matters over and
see if it wouldnt be better to keep out
of wall street

  i went away and thought matters
over and come to the conclusion that
as a con woman i had fell too hard for
them orbs a con woman always has
ways of finding out about a man so i
found out about mr marvin frewen

  i found he was all right absolutely
o k passed and stamped under the
pure heart act on lots of boards of
charities you see he took charge of the
private charities of people so rich that
they never took time to sign their own
checks-oh bill how i yearned for that
man when i found this out besides
the tip of temptation



  that he had all kinds of money of his
  own one of them ex-center-ick old guys
  that is around loose in holes and corners
  i in the big burg that if the crook pro-
  fession was organized proper wed have
  wrote up in a business guide he was
  next naturally to the big guys down in
  the street

     well bill if there is one thing i am
   im a business woman which same is
    proved by the fact that i got six thou
   outer jake on my necklace and coulder
   got more but that i had to have it quick
   so as to get into crunchable steel with-
   out losing thousands and thousands by
   j waiting

    did mr frewen put you into c s
  yes but not until i had worked on
  him for a hour and made the most aw-
  fulest scream of despair it was a win-
  ner that scream better than i ever done
  when slimmy breaks in on me when we
  are gettm a guy under the mann act
  she paused and gave a shiver

     bill stocks is a good name for them
  things because they get you by the neck
  and hands just like them stocks at dela-
  ware and all you can do is stay there
  till somebody or something comes to un-
  lock you loose first day i was in
  crunchable went down three points and
  i telephoned five times to mr marvin
  frewen to get me out then when i got
  the papers that night i seen it had gone
  up five points an i never slept a wink
  for fear i was out the worst of it
  was that slim had went to give his old
  town a look at him with honest graft in
  his clothes-first time hed ever went
  back there since he left it-just about
  the size of the water bucket he carried
  for the circus he run off with hed
  asked me to go with him imagine ask-
  ing a woman to go off with her husband
  when shes in the street

    t didnt tell slimmy i was in the
  street just let him think i was in for the
  bughouse

    did mr frewen get you out when
  you told him

    no i near died of delight when he
  phones me not to worry he knows when
  to do it so he did damn him 

    i saw her look toward my shaving

mug and i put it under my pillow while
i soothed her

  bill i was worse wore with the
week i was in crunchable than i ever
have been at any of my trials i just
couldnt keep away from near the ticker
though i was showed out of three ho-
tels where i was tipping the boys to run
into the cafe and bring me word from
the ticker i was always hollerin
through the phone no matter which way
crunchable went for mr frewen to do
something different than id told him to
do the last time i called him up finally
his clerk wouldnt let me talk to him no
more

  after id been showed out of them
hotels think of an artist like me going
into a hotel-with my standing and name
in the profession-thatll show you how
the game got me-after that i sat at
home never made a bed or dusted a
thing just sat there while messenger
boys was running back and forth from
the nearest pool room and all the time
losing pounds and pounds of my slender
flapper shape fierce fierce fierce

  but my dear gertruda why the
worry for the last week c s has
been bounding up without a break

  but how was i to know any minute
it wouldnt take to bounding down id
just set there and figure how much id
won and it got to seem like nothing
against what i might get if i stayed in
and then would come a boy with a slip
to tell me crunchable had went down a
point and id just scatter into a fit for
fear mr marvin frewen hadnt got me
out then come another slip to say it
was up two points and td sling my hat
off that i had put on with the intention
of going down and bustin in his door
and yellin till i got iny money they
wouldnt answer the phone at his place
no more when i called up and then i
just wouldnt know what to do

  i had two lines of messengers runnin
all the time one to bring me the news
about crunchable and the other to take
letters down to mr marvin frewen
you see his clerk had forbid me to come
to the office after id called four times
in one day

  i was glad slim wasnt home be-
 is

breezy stories

cause the flat was a sight with dust and
things that id broke to relieve my feel-
ings oh bill a lady crook that aint
able to get near a ficker is got a terrible
handicap when shes in stocks her own
home has to take what comes of her
feelings

  see here gertruda was marvin
frewen straight i was compelled to
demand

  absolutely said gertruda bitterly
no man who ever held my hands when
i had hysterics did it kinder

  so you had hysterics

  i did-right in the middle of all them
books with liim holding my hands and
the clerk watering my brow

  well so you went to his office after
all

  i should say i did-went aint the
word for the way i got there after a
strange voice had said over the phone
that mr frewen couldnt understand at
all and would i please come down

  i come down flat when i seen a
proper-looking old guy sitting at the desk
in the inner office a guy with natural
order orbs and seen a clerk that id
never lamped before yes mr marvin
frewen was all right-absolutely all
right except that he had went on a little
vacation and left his trusted clerk in
charge of his office his trusted clerk
that he had got out of a reformatory

  mr marvin frewen wasnt in wall
street at all he was one of them guys
that feels so sorry for the cons that
they just have to give them a chance to
work a new game and get away with it
better

  she stamped her foot with rage and
i feared for my looking glass

  how did you learn all this i hur-
riedly asked in order to save the furni-
ture

  i learnt from him between screams
hed went out of town for ten days
leaving his office in charge of he truest
char-acter that ever came out of the pen
he felt it was a perfectly right thing to
do because he said there was no temp-
tation in the way of money in the safe
as if an office like that and ten free
days wasnt temptation enough

  i broke away while he was calling

the bulls i seen then how it all was
texas had known the clerk and slim
had known texas and they had all
worked together to get me oh oh
oh i wouldnt have minded it if slim
had got the necklace working a lone
hand a husband cant be held account
able for what he does to his wife but
that he should have gone and got a crook
with glaring orbs to work me just as
if i was no more to him than any strange
woman that just busted up everything
as i told him when he came back this
morning with the clear blue eyes of his
plainly showing that he had been on a
bat with my money and some other
dame too ill bet he neednt think ill
ever fall for them eyes of his again
never again not if i have to spend the
rest of my life matchin that sweet blue
color which always has took me in a
mans lamps but bill bill my heart is
broke-my nerve is gone-im a ruined
woman and a wreck-thats why im
asking you to put me next to honest
work

  here gertruda gave way to a grief
so great that she almost dragged the
sheet off the bed

  i was much relieved by a knock at
m door

  come in i said

  there entered a figure all in gray
whiskers spats gloves scarf and hat
at sight of whom gertruda made a
scream

  its him she cried springing to her
feet and pointing bill its the crook
that got my money that passed himself
off as mr marvin frewen bill i dont
care if hes your life-long brother im
going to haul off his hay in bunches

  my dear madam said an aged dig-
nified voice before you go any further
allow me to tell you it is all a mistake
and i here the gray gloves brought
outa long wallet-having found you
were not at your home and being told
by your husband that you probably were
here since you had said you were com-
ing here i followed to give you this
extracting a huge roll of yellow bills of
staggering denomination this is your
profit on the stock that your money was
the tip of temptation



invested in your original investment
has grown to ten thousand dollars
lemme faint said gertruda in a
weak voice

  but instead of fainting she gave a
frightened scream bill rill his eyes
has turned blue her shaking finger
pointed at the eyes that the thick lenses
had magnified hideously

  the old man in gray straightened up
and took off his spectacles gee- said
a young brisk voice its good to get
them off i can no more see through
them than through a board

  off also came the whiskers and wig
and the handsome face of slim dick
grinned in triumph at us

  say bill he cried what do you
think of a crook and a lady confidence
woman at that that dont know a mao
can expand the pupils of his eyes till
they are so big they look black by using
belladonna say gert own up now
which is the better crook

  for a moment as i shuddered before
the expression in gertrudas face i
thought that the furniture slim and i
were all going down in one grand wreck
then i saw something in her face that
gave me a faint hope that we might still
be saved

  why didnt you tell me this at
home demanded gertruda

  because the instalments on the fur-
niture are all paid and besides i want-
ed bill here for a witness come on
which of us is the better crook
gertruda turned to me

  bill here will be my witness if i aint
always said you was cried gertruda
oh slimmy-slimmy how did you
dare risk them lamps of yours even for
me bill aint that devotion for you
aint that-

  but here slimmy gathered her unto
him and proudly addressed me above
her head

  its settled who is the champion-
now we are going to have a happy
home

  after this quavered gertruda as
she extracted slims pocket handkerchief
and dabbed her eyes the bouts will all
be strictly according to the rules-
scratching and biting barred i swear it
a day or two later slim called upon
me

   look here bill he confided in case
gertruda should ask you dont tell her
anything about how stocks are bought
on margin she thinks i used her money
to buy outright and so shes content with
a small profit-but if she knew how wed
worked it she might not be quite so calm
you know what a business woman she
is i never meant anyway to really
lift that necklace but texas and me
could only raise a thousand and that
was only enough to flash on her i know
her well and so i decided just not to
let her know i was using her money in
stocks but give her the profits after wed
got out and all was settled shes awful
nervous about her own money see how
comfortable it all worked out

  but it seems to me she did know
that somebody was using her money in
stocks at least i got that impression
from her

  i know but somebody aint a
womans husband somebody dont have
to listen to her like a husbands gotta
besides a woman aint got any real con-
fidence in a mans judgment after he has
let her marry him remember bill not
a word about buying on margin what
a mans wife dont know she cant worry
him about yet funny aint it that with
all the brokers gertruda has known she
never learned about buying on margins
gertrudas a natural genius ill admit
that but shes not got the kind of mind
thatll make her a great artist to be a
great artist you just gotta clamp your
mind on the dee-tails

  and slim went off perfectly satisfied
that he had proved his case he was
the better crook
her husband

   by william goode

some person who evidently be-
lieves himself an authority has
gravely asserted that women dif-
fer only in the color of their hair
he would have us believe that tempera-
mentally physically and morally they are
all alike offering no argument myself
i will mention one at least who to my
knowledge could not be made to believe
this ed stanton was absolutely con-
vinced that there was one woman on
earth so vastly different so superior to
all others as to offer no comparison
and ed handsome free-hearted and
winning fellow that he was had known
many of them in his day

  to his brother drummers on the road
he could talk of nothing but his cosy little
harlem flat and the wife and three-year-
old kiddie if you were to believe him
the happiest hours of his life were when
he could jump a week-end down to new
york and spend them in his home

  one saturday he dropped into syra-
cuse to see a customer the man was
out of town and would not be back till
monday it was important that ed
should see him so there was nothing
for it but to be on hand early monday
morning it was eds chance he could
easily get back to syracuse on a sunday
night train so he left his effects in the
hotel and started hot-foot for the depot
he just caught the new york flyer and
dropped into a seat beside jim hovey
a fellow commercial traveller

  now ed didnt care much for jim
for he didnt believe him on the level
in his travels he had heard stories of
his escapades with hotel waitresses and
he did not approve of that in fact jim
really stood in bad at a number of up
country hotels on this account hovey
had a wife and four children down in
new york city ed thought it a good

time to remonstrate with him but hovey
resented it

  oh say ed stanton ive seen a few
of your footprints in the mud dont
preach to me

  not since i married jim

  poof do you suppose my wife is
sitting at home like a sick kitten while
i am away you betcher not shes
having a good time as well as i what
do you know about what your own wife
is doing

  i do know what she is doing while
i am away and eds big fist showed up
under hoveys nose dont you speak
of her again in that connection or ill
smash your face

  well how does she know what 
youre doing

  hovey got up and changed his seat
then for ed was plainly in a dangerous
mood as jim lived in brooklyn he
stuck by the train to the grand central
but ed dropped off at one hundred and
twenty-fifth street

  twenty minutes later he was kissing
his wife esther dancing the kiddie on
his shoulders and having a great time
in his own home

  ed dear said the little wife i
do so wish youd give up traveling and
go into business now theres old man
hooper on the corner wants to sell his
store-

  the retail trade is on the bum
darling said ed lightly a salary is
a regular thing and better for a while
when that little bank account of ours
gets big enough we three are going up
into some pretty little country town to
spend the rest of our days its the life
all right business is awful

  the subject was dropped for ed al-
ways refused to talk business at home
so he rolled over on the floor with the
kiddie allowing him to think he had

her husband



the best of the tussle which caused the
little fellow great delight

  dont you fink you is licked enough
now papa v he cried gleefully strad-
dling eds broad chest why dont you
cwy for me to stop and let you up 

  ed pretended to beg for mercy and so
the frolic went on until the kiddies eyes
began to grow heavy and mamma took
him away to bed

  i came down on the train with that
skunk jim hovey he remarked to the
wife ive lost all respect for him

  esther knew the story of the hoveys

  im sorry for mrs hovey she
sighed it must be awful to live with a
man like that

  well many a woman does dearest

  i dont

  she looked straight at him as she
spoke ed shifted a little

  im a man with all a mans mean
ways esther he said candidly i was
no better than any other-before i met
you no one has stepped in between us
since though

  she read truth in his handsome face
and folded her arms about his neck

  i f you were to forsake me ed id
kill myself

  bosh that would be foolish i
wouldnt be worth it besides theres
the kiddie

  her face burned and her eyes soft-
ened that terminated the discussion

  ed had to get the four-thirty the next
afternoon and he lingered until he had
to run for the train he wasnt sure
when he would be home again but he
hoped soon he would write it was
some chance like this that would bring
him home

  for a while after ed had gone the lit-
tle wife had a bit of a cry it wras not
from unhappiness by any means only
a little feeling of loneliness and longing
seeking a natural outlet she loved ed
stanton and she tried to trust him with
all her heart and soul she felt that he
was so big and noble and open-hearted
as to be incapable of wrong he had
never concealed anything from her in
all things they had been as one every
penny of his money was banked every
month in her name and the account was

nearing the necessary figures to purchase
that little home in the country they had
so long planned for

  but she was a woman and lives there
a woman who is not a victim of doubt
he was away from her so much in the
great world with its temptations-that
-possibly-she tried to smother the ser-
pent of suspicion

  she went to bed a little later and it
was not until the next morning as she
was dusting the living room that she
made a discovery

  why ed left his raincoat she said
yanking it from the depths of a chair
thats too bad it looks like a rainy
spell and he will need it

  knowing there was no way to send it
to him she started with orderly instinct
to hang it in the closet she had closed
the door upon it when a characteristic
thought impelled her to go back

  i wonder if he left anything valuable
in the pockets she mused and felt a
little tug of fear in her breast quickly
her nimble fingers sought the depths of
each pocket a pair of gloves a couple
of buttons some matches and-she drew
forth a folded sheet of notepaper

  the bell rang

  she had to hustle to the door it was
only the butchers boy with the crum-
pled note in her hand she went back
little homer was playing with his toys
on the big rug she passed him and
went into the kitchen there - she
smoothed out the note and read with
dilated eyes and stifling heart

  well honey here i am in the sweet
little apartment you have provided for
your little caged bird its a dream and
i know i shall be happy here waiting for
your coming day and night i dream
of you and long for you of course
dear i know how life is its pretty
hard for you to have her on your hands
but you will find a way to dump her
when the right time comes then we
will be together always i shall expect
you on tuesday sure you can run
down in the afternoon and go back the
next morning darling that will be a
happy day when we arc together for
all time


breezy stories

  p s-dont forget the candy and
the cigarettes and dont forget the change
in number s one hundred and
twenty-ninth street with a hug and a
kiss

your own cablohta

  twice the staring eyesight of the lit-
tle wife followed these lines from start
to finish the floor reeled and she rank
into  chair dizzy and confused life
had become a sudden void the world
grown desolate and dark she clutched
her throat to get breath and so for a
time she sat there more dead than alive

  so the thing she had feared had come
to pass in one fell swoop the happiness
of her life had gone out in darkness it
would never come back all was ended
she tried to think what to do

  how long she battled with reason sit-
ting limply there in the chair she never
knew she was brought out of her
stupor by a sudden crash a little scream
and she sprang up and rushed into the
parlor

  little homer had pulled a pretty vase
from the table and it lay in fragments
he was whimpering and expecting a
scolding the revulsion came and she
impulsively caught him up in her arms
wildly kissing and fondling him

  poor little boy she wept inconti-
nently you didnt mean to do it darling
no its all right mamma wont scold
ive onlv you now-darling only you

  the little fellow was puzzled

  dont cwy mamma he patted her
wet cheek me didnt mean to bweak
it me sorry

  she overwhelmed him with kisses and
then found his toys and went to her
room to think to think-that was it-
what she should do

  for an hour she fought it out there
alone then calmness came to her at
last

  esther stanton came of a stnn that
in years past had furnished heroes in
the service of the nation her father
had fought and died at gettysburg
two brothers had died in the navy
she knew of only one living relative an
uncle somewhere in the upper part of

the state she would never think of
going to him

  she was alone

  perhaps it was just as well but this
woman who had come between them-
she clenched her hands and thought of
course even if ed was to discard the
woman she could never take him back
she could never trust him again

  ill give him up she said resolutely
it is better-but i want to see her i
want to impress upon her what a thing
she has done

  she smoothed and folded the fatal
letter if she hadnt found it she might
never have known she knew that hun-
dreds of men were practising this decep-
tion every day but mercifully their wives
never knew it

  her resolve was made mrs belden
her next-door neighbor would care for
homer for an hour or so

  dressed neatly and looking charming
in spite of her pallor she was soon rap-
idly making her way to the number in
one hundred and twenty-ninth street
it was not far she wondered how he
had dared to bring her so near to his
own home

  at last she found the number in a
narrow hallway she examined the let-
ter boxes there was a name which
convinced her

  carlotta st onge suite forty-two
in a few moments the elevator boy
landed her on the third floor and she
stood before the door of forty-two she
was a little faint but she called up her
nerve and pressed the bell

  the barking of dogs sounded within
then a diminutive colored maid stood
before her a couple of spaniels frisked
at her feet

  is-is miss st onge in

  are you expected

  it doesnt matter and esther
brushed past the maid and into the lav-
ishly furnished though unkempt room
beyond there was an odor of stale
cigarette smoke and a tall dark-haired
woman in a wonderful blue kimono rose
graceful as a panther from a lounge
she stared at esther half in amazement
and half in anger

  how is this she exclaimed haugh-
her husband



tily didnt i tell you to admit no one
sophy 

  i took the liberty said esther
calmly do not blame the maid it is
necessary for me to see you

  the woman regarded esther critically
and waved the maid from the room
then she sank back on the lounge and
indicated a chair

  well i admire your nerve how-
ever be seated and state your business
if its anything to sell-

  esther quickly extended the letter

  i found this in my husbands pocket
it explains itself

  the woman gave a start took the let-
ter glanced at it flushed hotly and re-
garded esther through half-closed lids

  righto lady  wrote that letter to
your husband so you are the wife eh
he and i are good friends

  so it would appear said esther
calmly though raging inside she had
self-possession enough to give the
woman before her careful mental ap-
praisement how could ed stanton love
a woman like that

  tin sorry with a drawl but you
see a mans heart will go where love
sends it she selected a cigarette and
extended the box will you smoke
you look all nerved up dear

  her words were soft solicitous and
her eyes held a slumbering light of sym-
pathy born of knowledge of conquest
esther returned her gaze without wa-
vering

  i have not the habit she said coldly
oh well im sorry replacing the
box nicotine is a wonderful bracer
of course you kncrw i am curious to
know why you have come i hope not
to shoot me

  it is hideous to shoot a reptile said
esther firmly i came here to gratify
my curiosity i wanted to look into the
eyes of one of my sex who could have
the heart to do what you are doing
carlottas eyes opened very wide and
she blew a ring of smoke

  dear me am i alone condemned is
he not also doing it

  knowing that he is pledged to pro-
tect and love another womah you can
hardly defend your position

  he swears he loves me he swears
he does not love his wife love will
go where the heart sends it am i wrong
in accepting it

  you are wrong because in doing that
you are destroying the sacred tics of a
home

  home her laughter was like a
bell what is that a song was writ-
ten about it i believe all the home i
ever knew was a small edition of the
inferno happy home eh husband
and wife scrapping and nagging eter-
nally  brother and sister fighting over
inheritances mothers dying broken-
hearted oh say all the hell there is
on this earth is to be found in the place
called home dont talk to me take
your own case as an example

  esther felt suffocated she recognized
that the woman was more virile more
powerful than she in every way a
great languid sensual philosophical fe-
male animal with a mind fed upon false
theories a social anarchist

  carlotta inhaled the cigarette smoke
you see she pursued the line be-
tween us is not so very well defined after
all youre a dear sweet little woman
but you dont know men its a shame
to fool you but dont blame your hus-
band altogether you have fooled your-
self you ought to have made a better
study of human nature if you had you
would never have married

  esthers eyes flashed

  such heresy as yours if commonly
accepted would destroy the world
without morality there would be no
life

  that word morality is a flexible one
said carlotta smilingly there is but
one standard to guide the human race
that is the instinct of love where there
is real love there is morality no laws
either of church or state no sense
falsely conceived of honor or duty can
change it love mocks at law and law
cannot control the dictates of love
you love my husband  asked esther
coldly

  i do and he loves me

  the room whirled about esther
when she came back her head was pil-
lowed on a soft breast and salts were


breezy stories

 at her nose perfumed lips gently
 touched her brow

  there little one you are all right
  now say but you are a sweet little
  creature any man ought to love you 
  esther put the other womans arms
  from her she whirled and gripped the
  edge of the table panting with fury
  dont dare touch me i hate you
  carlotta languidly dropped back on
  the lounge her half-shut dreamy eyes
  contemplated the wife silently

   you are a destroyer of homes of
 human lives you come into my life and
 steal from me the only treasure i have
 mv husbands love you make a widow
 of me and an orphan of my child there
 is no goodness in you with your blan-
 dishments you have stolen my husband
 you are a thief i loathe and despise
 you 

    esther put all her soul into her de-
 nunciation the two women gazed
 straight at each other carlotta had bit-
 ten her cigarette in two there was a
 dull sombre light in her half-shut eyes
 her wonderful shoulders moved at last
 in the faintest sort of a shrug

     capital my little tragedienne i never
  saw it done better however you came
  to see me with a purpose you came to
  ask something of me what is it

    i will accept nothing from you
    not even your husband

   no

  well scornfully you can have him
  -if you can get him we will let him

choose

    esther was breathing hard

    the choice is already made she said
  i have no will to interfere with his de-
  sires as betrayed in the letter i have i

	renounce all claim to him he is
 yours

    not yet said carlotta rising sud-
  denly you misunderstand me i want
  you to know that my sympathies are with
  you and that i am not as bad as you
  think i am i am going to be fair un-
  less he is willing to choose roe in your
  presence i renounce him forever if
  he has told voti he loves you and he has
  told me he loves me he has lied to one
  of us the fairest way to settle this mat-
  ter is to go before him

  it is not necessary-

  pardon me it is necessary-and pos-
sible carlotta pointed to an ormulu
clock in four minutes if he keeps his
word and he has never failed me yet he
will be here

 esther clutched at her heart ed com-
ing here so he had not gone to syra-
cuse after all he had lied to her he
was in new york and would be pres-
ently in this house-

  she started to leave her whole soul
rose in rebellion against the plan of fac-
ing him before this woman she felt a
horror and a repugnance beyond ex-
pression but carlotta stepped before
her she was big and powerful

  it is too late to get away dear she
said tensely listen

  the click of the outside door was
heard the low voice of the maid heavy
footsteps and a man s voice

  an insane frenzy seized esther
never would she face ed in that place
she wrenched herself free and darted
for a side door she was too qyick for
carlotta and sped through it there was
a narrow passage and she followed it
luckily to a side entrance dashing
down a flight of stairs she reached the
street

  how she got home she never remem-
bered finally faint and quivering she
burst into her own apartment and bolted
the door she paced the floor wildly
wringing her hands her married life
her dreams her hopes and joys had all
come to this ed her husband the man
she had so blindly worshipped was
false it was terrible

  for a long time she tried to fight it
out there alone by herself and to con-
quer the impulse to self-destruction
how desolate the world was how barren
was life in the midst of her hysteria
there came a gentle tap at the door

  mrs stanton

  it was the voice of her good neighbor
mrs belden with a great effort she
composed her self and staggered to the
door as she opened it little homer
came leaping into her arms

 i want my mamma my own
mamma

  she caught him up and kissed him
her husband

frantically lifting her tear-wet face fi-
nally to articulate

  so kind of you mrs beldcn i can-
not thankyou enough

  the little boy has done nothing but
call for you mrs stanton why my
dear are you ill are you in trouble
the kindly neighbor placed a motherly
arm about her waist esther controlled
herself long enough to say

  yes but i cannot explain it now
you are so kind mrs belden thank
you so much 

  all right my dear call me if you
need me

  esther closed the door and with ho-
mer in her arms staggered back into the
living room she sank into a chair the
little fellow was cooing with happiness

  homer loves oo mamma go is my
dear mamma i waited so long

  darling one we have only each other
now whispered the- stricken woman
then as the little fellow slid out of
her lap and played at her feet she tried
to think clearly what it was best to do

  of course it was all over between her
and ed the old life was buried she
must look to the future she must live
for little homer

  how could he have done it what
spell had that woman cast about him
she had believed him honest noble and
true bitterness raged in her heart a
terrible sense of wrong

  pease mamma dear ise awful hun-
gry pease can i have a pum

  bless your little heart sobbed the af-
flicted woman mamma is cruel to for-
get you yes you shall have a nice big
plum well go right now and-

  she caught sight of something in the
little fellows chubby fist it was a white
envelope tightly rolled

  what have you there homer give
it to me

  its a letter for oo mamma the
postman earned while you was away
mechanically she took the letter from
the tight little fist and unrolled and
smoothed it out as she glanced at the
superscription she gave a start it was
eds handwriting and addressed to her

  she saw also that the postmark was
syracuse and it was dated the previous

night puzzled she tremblingly tore the
envelope open numb with wonder she
read

my deak little wifie

   this is to let you know that i got
through all right i am writing to say
also that i met hovey on forty-second
street while i was running for the train
it seems that saturday night when we
came down on the same train from syra-
cuse we accidentally exchanged rain-
coats you will find his coat in the par-
lor in the chair where i left it if he
calls for it please let him have it also
i may be home tuesday night being
called back to the city-

  she read no more the room whirled
about her for a moment as a thrilling
realization of her great mistake burst
upon her

  the coat was not eds but hoveys
she had not announced her name when
she had called on carlotta and had of
course naturally been taken for the other
wife ed was in syracuse after all and
it was hovey from whom she had fled
the truth coming with a rush brought
vivid reaction with a wild scream of
joy she caught homer up in her arms
and fled to the kitchen

  the afternoon sun was flooding
through the western window seeming to
replace latent gloom with the brilliant
light of restored happiness a flock of
english sparrows chirped and fluttered
on the window ledge a hurdy-gurdy in
the street below burst into melody

  it was all in keeping the sudden
transition slightly weakened her but she
pulled little homers chair to the table
ensconced him in it and covered him with
kisses then she flew for the pans and
cooking dishes the words of a love song
trilling on her lips

  mamma is oo going to give homer
suffin to eat

  am i darling she cried from a
fullness of heart you shall have
everything you want and mamma is
going to cook some lovely things for lis-
ten pet papa is coming home to-morrow
night your papa and my husband-the
best truest man on earth-my husband
an eye for an eye

by william a mcgarry

an almost imperceptible zephyr
from the elm-shaded avenue ed-
died through the raised window
of claytons beautiful mansion
swaying the silken curtains ever so
slightly a little cloud of pungent pow-
der smoke lazily rose disintegrated and
was carried away

  clayton in evening dress stood stu-
pidly over the prone bodies of marsden
his lifelong chum and she who had been
his wife the revolver given him by
the dead man on their first trip after big
game was in his hand it was an auto-
matic needing but the slightest pressure
to let loose its messengers of death

  a pool of blood from the breast of
the woman stained the carpet a darker
hue she lay as she had fallen save her
right arm which thrown up in protec-
tion had limply relaxed and settled to
her side her heaving breast had grown
still and no sound but the breathing of
clayton broke the intense stillness

  marsden his features distorted in a
death-grin of fear had not moved his
body lay crumpled as though every bone
were broken a bell clanged somewhere
in the house but clayton took no heed
it was followed by a crash and a squad
of blue-coats led by the precinct cap-
tain entered with drawn revolvers the
automatic was taken from claytons un-
resisting hand and he was manacled
no questions were asked they were
unnecessary

  time passed unnoticed and clayton
sat mute and unseeing behind the nar-
row bars he slept and ate mechani-
cally the protestations of friendship
and offers of help which had plenteously
at first reached his cell passed without
answer and now he was left severely
alone

  only once did he speak-just before

the jury went out the unwritten law
was his defense he said but little-a
word picture of his life as it had been
before his one-time friend stepped in a
sketch of his ideals the feelings that
came to him when he saw his home had
been destroyed-that was all then
again he sank into the chair silent
morose

  presently a stir followed by a death-
like hush marked the return of the jury
a deep voice sounded unnecessarily loud
in the stifling stillness of the court room
not guilty it said

  as one in a dream gay ton walked
from the place he submitted passively
to congratulations dully without
thought he answered business questions
from his lawyer-whose face bore a
look of conscious pride at the victory
a taxicab called by a friend stopped
at the curb to receive him he was
sharply reminded that he had not paid
the fare as he left the vehicle before
the door of his home

  home the unspoken word jarred
on his nerves things were sadly out
of place why did this picture persist
in staring at him why this odd jap-
anese chair his last birthday gift to her
always bar his way all the house
seemed wrapped in an atmosphere of
gloom and despair voices called from
corners behind chairs but the suddenly
lighted electrics revealed no one

  petulantly he invaded the upper re-
gions of the house a drawer in his
bureau slid open creaking to his pull
a blued burnished automatic mate to
that other sparkled before his eyes
unthinkingly his fingers closed over it

  as in a dream he wandered back to
that room he had left months ago mana-
cled accused he gazed unseeing into
the chilly blued barrel of the weapon
mutual

in his hand his eyes strayed around
then fell on the dark stain on the rug
he forced himself to look away-then
he found the stain again before his eyes
it seemed to mock him and once he
thought he heard it chuckle his blood
froze in his veins as it dissolved took
shape and showed-her face

  for many minutes he gazed into her
eyes they were sad and reproachful
perhaps after all he had been wrong
hasty he could see her as she looked
the first day they met-then as she
looked on their wedding day and he
had killed her perhaps without cause
he forgot that a jury of his peers had
acquitted him-forgot everything ex-
cept that now fear of the death to wfiich
lie had sent her was on him

  summoning all his will he tore his
gaze from the dark ominous stain
again his eyes fastened on the blued
muzzle of the revolver nervously toy-
ing with the safetyr catch his fingers un-
loosed it the whir of an automobile
passing on the avenue grew less dis-
tinguishable then it took strength and
swelled into an eerie moan of anguish
it sounded to him like an accusation
again he called on his will and uncon-
sciously his muscles tightened answer-
ing the leaping surge of his heart

  the double grip of the automatic
released a spring hidden in its perfect
steel heart as quick as thought itself
the mechanism obeyed its law an empty
shell flew out with a snap there was a
dull thud-then silence

  outside a blue-coat idly swinging his
club and ruminating on the law which
allowed a rich man to go free suddenly
stiffened as the hound at bay all sign
of laziness left him and he bounded up
the steps of the mansion two at a time
a whistle sounded for the second time
the massive front door was forced open
for the second time a squad of police
entered the gorgeously furnished parlor
of claytons home an odor of powder
smoke met them strong and pungent
a rapidly enlarging pool of blood was
darkening the outlines of an already
dark ugly stain on the rug open-
mouthed the blue-coats stood tense and
silent

  a rattling of curtain rings boomed
almost deafening in their ears silently
the captain-he who had led that other
squad-turned and gestured and the men
filed out leaving one on guard again
all was silent save the whispering
breeze fanning the smoke and rustling
the silken curtains

mutual

 by henry g p spencer

 these lines i write to you
 you imp in womans guise
 youll say unjust-untrue
 but sweet i do not rue
 for looking in your eyes

 with plighted lips you swore
 j have kissed none but you
 and then you gave me more
 of loves delicious store

 and i-but i lied too
generous george

    by townsend cushman

were engaged maybe its
not just the manly thing for
a suffragist to do but george
is as strong on suffragism as
i am and as hes in the soup too he
can t call the kettle black-and-dont
give me away-such delicious bouillon
it is but anyhow george is too gen-
erous and broad to say unkind things
about slipping up

  weve known each other so long that
we could freely talk over everything
and hes going to allow me-i mean im
going to have perfect freedom when
were married he says he believes
thoroughly in a woman having the equal
right of a man to work and i mustnt
think of giving up my job pounding a
typewriter down at the monopoly trust
and hes so clear-headed that he sees
all possible contingencies and good
why he says my salary may help out
like everything at times for hes sell-
ing goods on commission and when busi-
ness is poor my fifteen per may be
mighty useful to us just think of little
me being able to lend a hand in dull
times and george says its nearly always
dull in july and august and no use in
his even going round to call on cus-
tomers so he will stay home and look
after the house and to keep from wor-
rying will take little runs down to coney
for a dip in the surf and get home
feeling fit and fine when i come up from
the office poor fellow he says he cant
do that now because when hes not mak-
ing anything he cant do these stunts
tsnt he good to let me help out like
that 

  and he says whenever im tired even-

ings he wont bother about my trying to
entertain him and i can just settle down
in my big arm-chair i-bought last year
as a christmas present to myself and
enjoy the evening paper when hes fin-
ished it and hell go round to his little
club so i can have a real quiet restful
evening think of the poor fellow go-
ing out to try and get a little amusement
just so i wont feel the need of any
effort to keep up

  then too he says if any time im
really sick and not able to be up and
around i can go to mothers until i
feel entirely well enough to attend to my
household duties in the mornings and
evenings before i go to the office and on
my return i just hate to think of the
dear lonely boy eating at restaurants
while im at mothers but he says i
mustnt worry about him and just hurry
and get well for fear those old mo-
nopoly people might fire me if i was
away too long isnt he thoughtful only
my welfare in mind and no matter about
himself

  and one rather delicate subject we
touched on too but you know i said we
knew each other so long and well and
in these modern broad times what does
anything matter anyhow wrell i
spoke of what i would like our children
to accomplish and become in life and
george - good generous george - he
said he did not want us to have any
as it would add a lot to my work and
care and that anyhow it was so effemi-
nate of course ive always claimed
to be a staunch suffragist and i suppose
i shouldnt do anything womanly if i
can help it-but
