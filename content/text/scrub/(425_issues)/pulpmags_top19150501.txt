boots for barton

large consignment of shoes
had just been delivered at
the emporium as long 
mckenzies general store in
burt city montana was
usually known and amos long the fat
little senior partner was standing in
the doorway watching one of his as-
sistants unpacking the case of goods

  as the boxes were carried into the
a 

store one of them considerably larger
than the usual shoe box dropped to the
ground and out fell a pair of heavy-
soled tan bluchers with eighteen-inch
tops that they were a special order
was certain

  long picked up the shoes and was
admiring them when arlo mckenzie
the other member of the firm came to
the door it was only recently that
mckenzie had bought a share in the
business and long began explaining to
him about these particular bluchers


top-notch magazine

  theyre for tom barton at dry
wash he said for the last six years
regular barton has sent to the em-
porium for a pair of them oak-sole
laced-knee contraptions funny how a
mans got to have the same thing right
along when he once gets stuck on it
bartons got a ranch down here in
charge of a foreman named hoover
but he stays mostly up at dry wash
himself him and his men are good
customers of ours arlo and we got to
treat him white say jerry and long
turned to his assistant put them tan
bluchers in a box wrap em secure and
send em by express prepaid to barton
sames usual

  maybe id better do that said mc-
kenzie things are sort of quiet in
the store and i can just as well attend
to that as not

  mckenzie was a tall meager-framed
man middle-aged and looking at least
ten years older than he really was dur-
ing the last week long had noticed that
he seemed absent-minded that his eyes
had grown dull and his face haggard
just as though something was worrying
him this bothered long a good deal
for his heart was kindly and he did not
want to see his partner get under the
weather and perhaps take to his bed

  all right mac maybe youd better
said long and that reminds me of
another thing business is quiet and if
youd like to go away for a couple o
weeks with lois-fishing or something
else-i guess the emporium wont suf-
fer youre lookin kind o peaked the
last few days go off somers and have
a good time why not

  mckenzie flashed a quick glance at
his partner im all right amos he
answered and he laughed lightly as he
took the boots from jerry but it was
a forced laugh and long knew mc-
kenzie was far from being all right
however he did not press the matter
further

  mckenzie went into the storeroom

with the boots perhaps half an hour
later he emerged with a package under
his arm and started for the express of-
fice dont forget to send em pre-
paid long called after him and by
express barton never uses parcel post
much

  i get you answered mckenzie

  at the express office a reeves the
driver had just got back with a load of
stuff from the station he took the
package handed over by mckenzie
looked at the address and turned to
the scales

  wheres summerfield al in-
quired mckenzie

  summerfield was the express agent
and for very good reasons which will
appear later an excellent friend of mc-
kenzies reeves was a freckle-faced
red-headed youngster and he grinned
widely as he answered he just saw
some one go by mr mckenzie and
went out to walk down the street with
her a ways

  ah mckenzie murmured and a
glow came into his dark eyes the
sparkle vanished suddenly and an ex-
pression of sorrow flashed into the thin
face

  this hugs six pounds mighty close
observed reeves and if you want to
prepay it will cost you two bits

  i want it to go prepaid said mc-
kenzie whats the method when you
send a package prepaid al  he in-
quired exhibiting a sudden interest in
the drivers work

  give you a receipt first was the
answer and the driver proceeded to
write one out with an indelible pencil
next he went on after exchanging
the receipt for a quarter which he
dropped into the till i put on this
yellow prepaid slip

  a pad of the slips lay on the coun-
ter and he picked one off drew it
across a wet sponge and slapped it on
the parcel whats the value mr mc-
kenzie  inquired reeves
the fluctuating package



   not enough to mention said the
other its way below fifty dollars
and the receipt calls for a valuation up
to that amount in case the package is
lost doesnt it

   right-o leme have the receipt a
minute

   he picked up a rubber stamp pressed
 it upon an ink pad and then brought it
 down hard on the piece of paper mc-
 kenzie had laid on the counter  value
 asked and not given  he remarked
 notice now ill just mark the pre-
 paid slip with the weight and the
 amount you paid he suited his action
 to the word marking a plain  in
 the space for the weight and  in
 that for the amount there you have
 it he finished nothin very compli-
 cated about that huh

   is that all there is to it queried
 mckenize

	well answered reeves joe sum-
merfield makes out the waybill

   is that complicated

   easy as failin off a log say said
 the driver obligingly ill make out the
 waybill for this just to help joe out
 and show you how its done

  he went back to a counter in the
rear of the office and returned with sev-
eral yellow slips probably two feet long
and three and one-half inches wide

   these are printed at both ends
see  he continued in the middle
theres a blank space i fold the two
printed ends over with a piece of car-
bon underneath timesavers thats
what heres the date-that goes on
with a stamp he used another stamp
and the ink pad then heres a stamp
with burt city montana on it and
our block number i use that too
now i fill in

  while reeves was writing mcken-
zie examined the last rubber stamp
tthe two printed ends are torn off
the driver continued thusly he
wrenched the slip into three pieces
this-and he held up one printed end

-is pasted on the package picking
up a brush he pushed it into the dex-
trin can and smeared the back of the
bit of paper and smoothed it down on
the package the middle piece we
keep he added and the other end
goes with the-bunch of waybills i hand
to the messenger on the train thats
the whole of it mr mckenzie

  the junior partner examined the
package carefully then laughed as he
turned away simple enough when you
know how al he remarked much
obliged for your trouble he then
went out of the office

  reeves took the package and laid it
 the floor by the stove with a num-
ber of other outgoing parcels after
that he went on unloading his wagon
and making ready for his afternoon de-
livery

  i ought tove told mckenzie mut-
tered reeves that his package got in
too late for seventeen and will have
to lay over until to-morrow at eleven
but i reckon it dont make much differ-
ence the package will be in dry wash
to-morrow afternoon long  mc-
kenzie are mighty good about givin
us stuff they could send by parcel post
our business aint fell off much with
that firm

  joe summerfield came in presently
with a smile you could have seen a
block away and walked into his cage
he was busy getting his office in shape
for the traveling agent this gentle-
man was supposed to drop in every
three months but he had a way of
showing up at any old time

  hows lois joe

  summerfield looked up to see the
grinning impish face of the driver
pressed against the cage wires oh
you go chase yourself he laughed
and threw a paper weight

  about three oclock that afternoon
while summerfield was alone in the of-
fice and busy at his desk he heard a
sound behind him and turned in his


top-notch magazine

swivel chair the next moment he was
on his feet his face beaming hello
lois  he cried say come in and sit
down cant you

  a young woman had walked in be-
hind the counter a very pretty young
woman she was too but her fair face
wore rather a serious expression at that
moment

  i can only stop a second joe she
answered so ill not come in and sit

down i want to ask you vf-

  youre not going away broke in
summerfield noting a satchel in the
girls hand

  oh no she said and smiled i
was just taking this to-the store for fa-
ther do you know any one named
lewis ruthven

  do i  said the express agent
coming out of his private quarters
well i should say so hes from the
east lois and a mighty fine chap
hes out on a ranch near herej-bar-
tons ranch the one hoover has charge
of- why are you acquainted with
him 

  no she returned i never saw mr
ruthven but i have a letter-it came
only a little while ago-from my friend
gwendolyn arnold of albany new
york she knows mr ruthven and
she writes that she has asked him to call
and see father and me

  your father must know him lois
ruthven is in town quite often and all
the ranch trading is done at the em-
porium

  then ill ask father about him she
said as she went through the gate at the
end of the counter going to work to-
night joe

  i think so

  will i bother you if i drop in for
a little while

  will you bother me he scoffed
well i should say not but why the
hurry

  i must be going on she said with

some constraint if mr ruthven calls
i wish you could come with him joe

  maybe i can fix it lois well see
and he walked with her to the door and
watched her fondly as she moved off
down the street regular princess
thats what she is he said to himself
as he returned to his work never was
another girl like her and never will be
wonder if it costs any more to keep
an establishment of your own than to
go on barely existing at a boarding
house i-well it takes two to make a
bargain wish this gwendolyn arnold
had kept stilt about ruthven if a girl
had to make a choice between him and

me- he did not finish that line of

thought but broke off with a frown

  half an hour later he began looking
over the packages by the stove when
he picked up the package for thomas
barton he remembered ruthven and
gave the package some attention

  al must have taken this in he said
to himself hes got it marked for six
pounds and ill eat my hat if he hasnt
made a mistake he weighed the par-
cel in his hands sure he has he de-
clared and took it over to the package
scales it tipped the beam at just eight
pounds one on al he said grin-
ning it wont go out until to-morrow
and ill just put it in the storeroom and
have some fun with that little runt

  two hours later reeves came in to
load the stuff for no  eastbound
summerfield immediately went for him
youve got an education al sum-
merfield inquired

  so-so said the driver a bit sur-
prised i can figger rings all around
you although i aint so cocky about it

  see things straight do you havent
got the blind staggers or anything like
that 

  not sost you can notice it you big
windjammer whats pestering your
mind huh thats something ill be
hanged if i can see through you must
have taken a funny powder
the fluctuating package



  go out and buy me a cigar or-
dered summerfield a fat perfecto
geigel has em two for a quarter
who says the cigars are on me

  i do you took in a package for
barton at dry wtash didnt you
yep if youd been attendin to busi-
ness instead of paradin around with a
skirt i wouldnt have had to take it
in

 you marked that package six
pounds

  thats what it weighs in at i re-
member it collected two bits from
your father-in-law elect arlo mcken-
zie why

  it weighs eight pounds son go into
the storeroom and get it and see for
ourself

  reeves looked startled then he
rushed for the storeroom and got the
barton package from a shelf by the
window summerfield leaned against
the counter with a complacent smile
while al laid the package on the scales
say joe the driver whooped what
you givin me 

  eight pounds eh queried sum-
merfield 

  no six come and look

  the smile vanished from summer-
fields face and his complacency dis-
appeared he went hurriedly to the
scales looked rubbed his eyes and
looked again the beam tilted at not
quite six pounds next he looked at the
package blew the dust off the scales
and weighed the shipment very care-
fully for himself he peered at the hi-
larious reeves in astonishment

  i weighed that package an hour or
two ago he declared and it weighed
eight pounds

  yes you did  cried reeves trou-
ble with you is joe lois mckenzie has
got you buffaloed you dont know
whether youre afoot or horseback right
side up or standin on your head who

buys from geigel huh who-

 the door opened and some one

walked in a cheery voice called
howdy summerfield

chapter ii

clearing the situation

duthven exclaimed the express
 agent glad of the diversion say
youre just the fellow i want to see

  oh no said reeves jeeringly
ruthvens not the fellow you want to
see joe you want to see a doctor
youre pickled-fifty-seven different
ways

  get out of here growled summer-
field or youll miss that train

  well im not missin any sleep be-
cause i cant see straight scored the
driver and he winked at ruthven as
he went out of the door with an armful
of bundles

  whats the trouble ruthven in-
quired

  funny mix-up in weights said the
agent but i guess its one on me it
only goes to prove that a fellow cant
be so wise all the time as he is just some
of the time what are you all dolled up
for he inquired taking note of ruth-
vens unusual appearance

  lewis ruthven was a big fellow and
yet there was not an ounce of super-
fluous flesh on him his shoulders were
broad his chest was deep and he meas-
ured six feet in height he had come
from the east two months before and
had gone straight into the cattle coun-
try to the barton ranch south of burt
city

  it was known that tom barton was
his mothers brother and that he had
come to montana because he had had a
disagreement with his father how that
got out no one knew ruthven him-
self was not saying a word he was
just cheerfully taking life as he found
it and doing his best to make good on
uncle toms lower ranch already he
had shown such an aptitude for bust-
ing bronchos and roping steers-and


top-notch magazine

incidentally cleaning up on the ranch
bully-that he had been promoted to be
second in command under hoover over
that particular bunch of cattle and cat-
tlemen

  as a general thing when he rode into
burt city he wore a demoralized broad-
brimmed hat a flannel shirt that showed
signs of hard usage and fringed leather
chaps but now as he stood in the
front of the express office he wore a
sack suit of excellent cut and quality
and a straw hat his was an appearance
to delight the eye so quiet and master-
ful and good looking was he

  i thought the boys would kill me
before i got away from the ranch said
ruthven they tried to pull me out
of the buckboard and muss me up and
we had a high old time generally but
he added happily i didnt lose so much
as a horn button

  whats the cause of it all inquired
summerfield

  somebody asked me to do this
somebody whose word is law come to
supper with me joe and ill tell you
all about it i want you to help
come in at six then and we  go
to ham-ands for a feed ive got to
work to-night though

 got to i was hoping-

  somebody will be around here to
check up the office before very long and
his word comes pretty near being law
too ive got to be ready for him ruth-
ven 

  oh well said the other i can talk
with you about this business of mine
anyhow if youve no objections ill
just sit here and read the paper until
youre ready

  summerfield gave him an easy-chair
back of the counter then he went to
take the barton package back to the
storeroom but changed his mind and
decided to leave it out in front for fur-
ther examination when he could find
leisure

  shortly before six reeves got back

from the railroad station with a small
truckload of stuff from the west he
would have taken the barton package to
the storeroom for the night but the
agent told him to leave it where it was

  all right agreed the driver cheer-
fully  but it wont get any heavier
there by the counter joe

  hamilton andrew leffingwell owned
and operated the best restaurant in burt
city his place was known far and
wide as ham-ands which proved
how harmony sometimes runs between
a mans name and his business to this
place ruthven and summerfield re-
paired for a raid upon the bill of fare
getting a corner table where they could
talk for their own benefit and not for
that of ham-ands other patrons

  its like this summerfield con-
fided ruthven as they ate youre
pretty well acquainted with miss lois
mckenzie and i want an introduction
summerfields heart grew faint what
chance would he have in the raice for the
hand of the fair lois with that big
handsome easterner pitted against him 
whats the idea he asked

 a friend of mine-a very good
friend of mine-and ruthvens gray
eyes glowed brightly as he said it-has
written and asked me to call on miss
mckenzie i know miss mckenzies
father in a way but i would rather
meet the young lady through you
who is the friend that suggested
this inquired summerfield

  ruthven drew a seal leather photo-
graph case from the left inside pocket
of his coat opened it reverently and
held a lovely pictured face before the
eyes of his friend the sweetest little
girl in the world he declared with fine
feeling and whenever she asks a favor
of me it is as good as done that is
miss gwendolyn arnold summerfield
as the express agent peered into the
beaming earnest face across the table
all his vague fears took instant flight
ruthven would not-could not-prove
the fluctuating package



a rival there could be no doubt that
his affections were already anchored

  miss arnold and miss mckenzie
were friends at vassar college ex-
plained ruthven and i have been re-
quested as a friend of miss arnold to
make the acquaintance of miss mcken-
ize miss arnold seems to have the
idea that the rugged life of the ranch
will make a barbarian out of me unless
i have therefining influences of femi-
nine society

  bless her heart summerfield he
continued  so long as i have such beau-
tiful memories of her to cheer my mor-
tal existence nothing else is necessary
to keep me in the straight and narrow
way but she has spoken and i obey
it-it will give me a chance to write
more frequently i wonder if you get
that 

  impulsive- summerfield reached
across the table and caught ruthvens
hand in a firm and understanding grip
it will give me the greatest pleasure
old man he answered we under-
stand each other i think

  glances crossed and smiles came to
each face i think so said ruthven
with emphasis if you cant go with
me to mckenzies to-night when can
you go 

  as i told you went on summer-
field i am working this evening but
lois said she would call on me at the
office she does that occasionally when
the grind keeps me rather late and then
i walk home with her she dropped in
to-day to tell me that she would see me
at the office this evening

  bull- exclaimed ruthven you
can do the formal thing and then later
on perhaps i can call with you at the
house

  thats the ticket exactly by the
way lois mentioned your name when
she saw me miss arnold has written
to her about you so youre expected

  that couldnt be better when do
you wrant me to show up at the office 

  make it nine oclock

  ill be there

  supper over ruthven went to the
hotel to write some letters and sum-
merfield returned to his office and got
busy with his books and papers at
eight-thirty lois came and sat near
while he finished his labors then
when he had put away his books he
went over to the drug store for two
dishes of ice cream they preferred
eating the ice cream comfortably by
themselves in the office summerfield
then told lois about ruthven

  youll like him he declared ev-
erybody does he has a way of taking
a person by storm you might say he
is a college man and his father is rich
and contracts for improvements of va-
rious kinds all over the world nobody
seems to know just why the son is put-
ting in his time in this out-of-the-way
corner of the country but hes surpris-
ing everybody by the way he does things
on bartons ranch no 

  he helped out an unfortunate friend
in the east said lois and got dis-
missed from a school of mines on ac-
count of it his father sent him to
montana-by way of punishment i
suppose also his father cut down his
usual allowance and mr ruthven then
refused to take any allowance at all
her eyes sparkled that is the sort of
man he is joe

 paragon eh returned joe
grumpily

  she laughed and leaned forward to
box his ears gently i can tell from
the way gwen writes just how the land
lies she went on lewis ruthven is
her knight without fear and without re-
proach we must do what we can to
make life pleasant for him out here
joe

  before summerfield could answer
ruthven came in and the formality of
an introduction wras gone through
summerfield left the two chatting in the
cage and went out to put away the bar-


top-notch magazine

ton package for the night as he picked
it up to take it to the storeroom he gave
an exclamation of astonishment turn-
ing on an electric light over the scales
he proceeded to weigh the package
then he yelled and the other two came
hurrying out

  whats the matter joe asked lois
alarmed

  look at this will you returned
the agent both of you look tell
me on your sacred honor what does
that package weigh

  nine pounds said ruthven study-
ing the scales

  exactly nine pounds seconded
lois

chapter iii

jest boots

oummerfield drew his hand
across his eyes i wonder if im
crazy he gasped or if this is just a
plain case of witchcraft that pack-
age weighed six pounds when it was
first brought in then it weighed eight
then six again and now you tell me its
nine whats the answer

  the answer is said ruthven that
you probably made a mistake in weigh-
ing the package when it was first
brought in

  al took it in and weighed it re-
turned summerfield

  then it was als error right at the
start

  i weighed it carefully while al was
out and it weighed eight pounds when
he came back we both weighed it and
it weighed six pounds theres no way
of getting around that als eyes and
mine couldnt be deceived at the same
time any more than three pairs of eyes
can be fooled right now

  hm mused ruthven thoughtfully
maybe theres another package in the
office similar to this one and youve been
getting them mixed up

  no there is only one package for

barton at dry wash and thats it
there on the scales thered have to be
three packages in order to get three dif-
ferent weights

  ruthven his interest suddenly inten-
sified took the parcel up in his hands
so this is for uncle tom eh he
remarked what is it

  blamed if i know consignors are
long  mckenzie barton often sends
here for stuff he cant get in dry
wash

  then ill tell you summerfield
asserted ruthven theres something
wrong with your scales scales go
wrong once in a while you know why
ive heard how crooked sports weigh-
ing a pugilist in at a prize fight would
stick a quarter to the under side of a
weight with a piece of gum making
a hundred-and-sixty-five-pound man
weigh in at one hundred and forty-five

though every-

  there could be no tampering of that
sort in this office interrupted summer-
field al reeves is as square as a
die and what would be the use of
monkeying with the weight of a parcel
like that anyhow and im sure of
these scales but just to make assur-
ance doubly sure ill look them over
this he did and he even went so far
as to use a feather duster the result
was not changed however the bar-
ton package still weighed nine pounds

  try it on the fairbanks over there
suggested ruthven indicating a large
platform scales on the other side of the
room the arm of the fairbanks hung
at a nice balance with the weight in the
nine-pound notch

  thats the weight all right de-
clared ruthven puzzled it has always
been the weight too a fellow has got
to use reason summerfield and thats
what reason tells us this six-pound
and eight-pound stuff must be all flap-
doodle

  summerfield grinned in his bewilder-
ment id like to hear you tell al that
the fluctuating package



six-pound stuff is flapdoodle said he
fur would begin to fly right off ill
lock the package in the storeroom and
let him weigh it for himself in the
morning

  the storeroom was partitioned off at
one corner of the express companys
quarters in the end it had one win-
dow crossed with longitudinal bars
overlooking the alley summerfield de-
posited the package in a vacant place
on the shelf and carefully locked the
door upon it then all but one electric
bulb was switched off in the big room
and the three left the place

  the agent was going to walk home
with lois mckenzie it was a case
ruthven thought where three was a
crowd so he excused himself when near
the hotel

  im going to be in town overnight
summerfield said he in order to
transact some business at the bank to-
morrow for jed hoover uncle toms
foreman at ranch two maybe ill
drop around and find out if that bar-
ton package continues to grow

  come in before ten-thirty then
said summerfield the package goes
west on seventeen and that pulls
through burt city at eleven a takes
outgoing stuff down half an hour be-
fore train time

  correct assented ruthven

  miss mckenzie of course asked him
to call at her home whenever he hap-
pened to be in town and could find time
to do so gwen has written me a good
deal about you mr ruthven she ob-
served and joe and i both would like
to do all we can to make your stay in
montana pleasant

  thats very kind of you said ruth-
ven gratefully i shall probably bother
you and joe a good deal he bade
both of them good night and made his
way across the street to the hotel

  next morning summerfield heard
that harrington the traveling agent
was in town that meant a checking

up of the office and the agent congrat-
ulated himself on having everything
shipshape and ready for inspection
summerfields mind was upon harring-
ton and the mystery surrounding the
barton package was temporarily dis-
missed from his thoughts at half past
nine however lewis ruthven wan-
dered in and the agents mind was sud-
denly prodded

  how much does it weigh now in-
quired ruthven quizzically

 well see the agent answered he
turned to the driver who was busy in
the back part of the room al he
called how tnuch did you say that bar-
ton package weighed 

  six pounds-s-i-x was the prompt
response half a dozen three times
two one two three four five six
summerfield turned blandly to ruth-
ven you see how positive that little
runt is he remarked hes mr
know-it-all in this shebang

  hes got a surprise coming chuc-
kled ruthven havent you weighed
the parcel this morning

  hadnt thought about it until now
you see harrington the traveling
agent is in town to check up the office
my mind has been on him

  right where it ought to be by jing
called reeves when harrington finds
out the boss of this office is off his trol-
ley the kibosh is liable to drop maybe
ill be agent you cant tell

  come out of that delirium al sug-
gested the agent and get the barton
package and put it on the scales it
weighs nine pounds

  youre spoofing me old chap re-
turned reeves youve had another
bad turn and i hate to think of whats
going to happen to you bughouse bug-
house 

  nine pounds al declared ruth-
ven i was here last night when sum-
merfield weighed the package

  now theres two of you moaned


top-notch magazine

reeves wonder where this things
goiu to stop

 when he had vanished into the
storeroom ruthven and summerfield
winked at each other and slyly smiled
heres where we land on that little up-
start said ttie agent hes got a sur-
prise coming

  surest thing you know the other
agreed

  they watched from the front of the
office while reeves emerged from the
storeroom and placed the package on
the scales he looked once at the tilted
beam then turned away to his work
with a grunt of disgust

  ah ha  jeered summerfield now
what do you think you loquacious false
alarm struck you dumb didnt it

  oh look go look snorted the
driver

  summerfield and ruthven walked to
the packing scales both bent down
smiling then started erect with as-
tounded eyes on each other the pack-
age weighed six pounds

  the agent staggered to the water
cooler and took a drink then he un-
buttoned his collar ive got to have
air he gasped

  i dont see why said al youre
fuller of hot air than a balloon say
you make me tired is this all for sev-
enteen  gime that he added hold-
ing out his hand for the barton pack-
age its goin west and i want to tote
it away from this hang-out before joe
gets any worsen he is

  ruthven was examining the package
his eyes wide with amazement look
here summerfield he called the
agent walked over to him see that 
and ruthven indicated a penciled cross
at one end of the package under the
cord

  what of it asked summerfield

  last evening while you werent
looking miss mckenzie and i put that
private mark on the package so we
could identify it later if we wanted to

 there it is that makes this mystery
 brain-staggering my wits are all scram-
 bled hanged if i can make head or
 tail of it

   same here but whats the use of
 bothering the package leaves this of-
 fice as per waybill load it up al he
 added

   wait a minute interposed ruth-
 ven phone the emporium and ask
 long or mckenzie to come down here
 well have one of the shippers open the
 package and show us what it is that
 shifts its weight from six to eight and

	nine pounds and then back to six again
 hanged if i can rest till we know
 more

   i can tell you what it is said the
 driver imagination thats whstt youll
 have to hurry-i dont want to miss
 seventeen

   youve got a whole hour even if
 seventeen is on time returned sum-
 merfield and went to the phone after
 a few minutes he hung up and turned
 away long and mckenzie are both
 coming he announced maybe they
 can shed a little light on this business
 good idea ruthven and im glad you
 suggested it

   in five minutes the two partners
 came into the express office whats
 to pay joe wheezed long wiping the
 perspiration from his fat face as he
 leaned over the counter think were
 shippin clockwork bombs by express
 same as that holdup man done a spell
 ago and blowed up acar and wrecked
 a train what ails that barton pack-
 age anyhow

   it has a way of getting heavy and
 then light explained the agent a little
 sheepishly for the matter seemed too
 absurd for serious consideration mind
 telling us whats in it mr long
 what do you mean gets heavy and
 then light queried the senior partner

  the agent explained and long
laughed till he almost choked youre
the fluctuating package



batty jest batty he said here ill
show you whats in it

  he reached for the package carefully
untied and removed the string and took
out a heavy pasteboard box removing
the cover of the box he held up the
tan bluchers with the eighteen-inch tops
jest boots he chuckled

  for your uncle thomas barton mr
ruthven put in mckenzie he al-
ways sends to our store for that sort
of footgear

  orders a pair every summer added
long

  anything inside those boots in-
quired ruthven

  see for yourself

  ruthven turned both boots upside
down and shook them in order to fur-
ther convince himself he ran a hand
into each of them nothing inside
he announced then he examined the
box it was perfectly empty and had
contained only the boots

  mckenzie wrapped up the package
again carefully adjusting wrapper and
string in the old creases so as not to
disturb the express companys marks
thereupon the partners went away
again long fairly strangling with
mirth

  jest boots whispered summerfield
to ruthven load em up al he
added vigorously to the driver see
how quick you can get em away from
here

chapter iv

another jolt

aa aybe them boots gather moisture
from the air suggested the driver
with mock gravity and then maybe
they dry out again thats the how of
it joe they took on three pounds o
dampness last night and then shed it
this morning

  if youd dry up a little yourself id
like it mighty well growled summer-
field

  maybe theyre seven-league boots
and full of hocus-pocus went on
reeves moving toward the front door
with the package

  therell be a massacre around here
if you dont quit yelled the agent
darkly

  there was somethin i wanted to tell
you went on the driver from the door
and i plumb forgot it till now lois
mckenzie went east on six at eight-
thirty i saw her gettin on the train
what exclaimed summerfield
reeves repeated his statement
didnt you know he added she
wasnt totin any luggage and like as
not she has skipped town to get rid of
the express agent with which un-
feeling comment the freckle-faced
driver took himself off climbed into his
wagon and drove away

  i cant understand this muttered
summerfield lois never said a word
last night about leaving town theres
something in the wind that i cant un-
derstand lois hasnt seemed at all like
herself for a week or more

  bosh exclaimed ruthven thats
only your imagination summerfield 
everything seems to be getting my
goat the last few days remarked the
agent even a pesky trifle like that
barton package gets me all up in the
air well im going to find out about
lois right now

  he turned to the telephone and called
for long  mckenzie long answered
and summerfield asked for mckenzie
ruthven leaning on the counter was so
close to the telephone that he could
hear what came over the wire

  mac aint here said long

  this is summerfield at the express
office can you tell me where i can find
mr mckenzie 

  he went down to the train to meet
his daughter shes cornin in on sev-
enteen

  i didnt know till just a moment ago
that lois was out of town

went over there on an errand shell
be back at eleven  i guess she thought
it wasnt necessary to mention such a
short trip do you think your uncle
could tell us anything about whats the
matter withthose boots ruthven

  i dont see how he could youre
rid of the boots now summerfield and
you shouldnt let them worry you any
longer

  plague take it all said the agent
im nervous ive got a feeling that
something is about to happen you see

i-

  he broke off abruptly a little man
in a derby hat and wearing side whis-
kers came briskly in at the door

  why hello mr harrington called 
summerfield

  hello was the reply with a short
nod hows everything summer-
field

  about as usual

  harrington made himself perfectly at
home walking around behind the
counter he removed his derby hat and
hung it on a nail then he drew from his
pocket a black silk skullcap and pulled
it carefully down over a head prema-
turely bald next he got out of his
coat hung it under his derby and
taking out his cuff buttons turned up
his shirt sleeves all the while he was

taking stock of ruthven for the com-
pany did not like to have outsiders
hanging around its offices

  summerfield noted the glances mr
harrington said he my friend mr
lewis ruthven

  no relation of emmet k ruthven
i suppose queried harrington

  emmet k happens to be his father
said the agent

  at once the traveling agent thawed
emmet k ruthven was a name to con-
jure with

  the dickens gasped harrington
holding out his hand this is a pleas-
ure believe me your father sir has
built more railroads in the west than
any other contractor in the country
ruthven shook the offered hand he
was not the one however to sound his
fathers praises not that he did not
admire emmet ks achievements for
he did tremendously but he preferred
to let others blow the trumpet

  harrington greatly mellowed by
meeting this son of a great man went
into the cage summerfield was about
to follow him and get the books and
documents out of the safe when the
telephone bell rang he halted to an-
swer the call as before ruthven iwas
able to hear what came over the wire

  whos this queried the agent
crisply

  al was the response im at the
depot say joe what dyou think
the driver had received a jolt of
some sort that was evident his voice
was jerky and hoarse with excitement

 what do you want demanded
summerfield sharply that was no time
for persiflage harrington was there
and he had eyes and ears for all that
was going on

  its about that barton package
when i picked it up to put it on the
truck it seemed heavier than it ought
to so i jest toted it into the baggage
room and weighed it

  how much did it weigh
the fluctuating package



  ten poundst

 whose imagination is working
now jeered summerfield he could
not help that comment harrington or
no harrington

  thats all right old man but what
shall i do

  let it go with the rest of the stuff
of course was the answer whatre
you bothering me for he banged the
receiver on the hook

  that barton shipment gained four
pounds between here and the depot
ruthven said summerfield al has
pulled in his horns i guess by golly
its getting him

  whats that whats that inquired
harrington a package gaining four
pounds in weight between this office
and the depot unheard of prepos-
terous  what do you mean 

  rather mysterious thing mr har-
rington returned summerfield as the
distant whistle of seventeen was heard
blowing for burt city you know
thomas barton up at dry wash

  of course everybody knows tom
barton he is emmet k ruthvens
brother-in-law and the traveling agent
shot a friendly glance at lewis whats
barton got to do with it

  he ordered a pair of boots from
long  mckenzie here in burt city
a certain kind of laced knee boots-gets
a pair every summer mr long says
reeves the driver took them in yester-
day too late for seventeen which car-
ries the local stuff the boots weighed
six pounds

  pretty good weight that for a pair
of boots but go on 

  i weighed em later and they
weighed eight pounds then reeves and
i weighed them together still later and
they were back to six pounds last
evening they went up to nine pounds
ruthven happened to be here at the
time and hell bear me out they
weighed nine pounds last evening
didnt they ruthven he appealed

  certainly they did was the em-
phatic reply

  this morning mr harrington they
were down to the original six pounds
again

  the effect of all this upon harrington
was peculiar to say the least he had
started up from his chair with horror
growing in his eyes his lips were dry
and he moistened them with his tongue
twice he tried to talk but the words
stuck in his throat in the dead dra-
matic silence no  was again heard
in the distance rolling westward

  finally the traveling agent found his
voice for heavens sake he gulped
what else summerfield what else 
speak quick man

  both the agent and ruthven were
surprised at the traveling agents show
of consternation why faltered

summerfield what is there about-

  tell me the rest of it shouted har-
rington bounding clear of the cage
go on

  theres not much else sir said
summerfield pulling his wits together
the package weighed six pounds when
it left here and reeves the driver just
phoned that the package seemed badly
overweight when he started to put it on
the truck so he carried it irto the bag-
gage room and put it on the scales he
said it weighed ten pounds but i told
him to let it go forward according to
waybill

  the devil cried harrington de-
spairingly hopping around like a co-
manche indian doing a war dance
phone the station for reeves to hold
out that barton package

  its already loaded and-

  then phone for the agent to stop
the train

  trains gone

  harrington hurdled the counter like
an accomplished athlete tore through
the door and was off through burt city
like a streak he was in such a hurry
that he never stopped to put on his


top-notch magazine

coat he had rushed away just as he
was in skullcap and shirt sleeves

  ruthven stepped to the door to watch
him without let or stay the traveling
agent was galloping for the railroad
station people in the street stopped to
watch him with -vfonder presently
harrington whisked around a corner
and was lost to sight

  ruthven came back into the office
what do you know about that he
cried

  summerfield was lying limply across
the counter his face white and his eyes
filled with foreboding he roused up
a little as he met ruthvens bewildered
gaze

  what have i done he inquired
wildly anything that i shouldnt
what was it hit harrington so hard 
boots for barton hanged if i can see

hqw-

  just at that moment reeves drove
up to the walk in front tumbled out
of his wagon and rushed in ten
pounds he cried by thunder thats
what it weighed ask the baggage
agent i made him look at the scales
to make sure wouldnt it rattle your
spurs joe whats harrington tearing
down the street jfor he passed me
goin like a comet is it anythin about
that barton package

  i should imagine so returned sum-
merfield wearily

  what about it dont be so blamed
close-mouthed

  youll have to ask harrington al
was the reply hes the only one who
knows whats in the wind

chapter v

overhauling seventeen

the baffling nature of the mystery
caused a sudden silence to fall over
the three in the express office the mo-
ment was a breathless one for al
reeves and seemingly painful as well

he pulled off his cap and ran his fin-
gers through his mop of fiery hair

  somebody wake me up he mur-
mured or pm goin to scream joe
smoked a double-x brand of dope in
this bloomin roost and i been ketchin
the fumes johnnie hocus-pocus is
givin us a run for our auburn chip and
thats wrhat when i weighed that bunch
o trouble at the baggage room and
found it had put on four pounds be-
tween here and the depot everythin got
black i felt like i wanted to run
around in circles and gibber then-
then- he broke off abruptly

  say he went on veering to an-
other tack lois mckenzie got in on
seventeen her father was at the sta-
tion to meet her and he gave a grip
to somebody on the train youd have
thought the girl had been gone a year
from the fuss mckenzie made over her
she-

  tingle-ingle-ingle the telephone
bell rattled summerfields hand on
the way to the receiver poised uncer-
tainly in the air

  im getting so i hate to answer the
phone said he never know whether
im due for a josh or a jolt what do
you think it is this time the bell
snapped another warning wild and im-
patient here goes  muttered sum-
merfield and took down the receiver
hello

  a rush of words came along the wire
on the jump sir said the agent and
hung up

  its harrington he announced hus-
tling into his cage and throwing books
and papers into the safe hes at the
division superintendents office the
agent talked as he worked wants me
to come down to the station and wait
on the platform says if ruthvens here
hes to come too if he will theres a
ruction of some kind afoot al youre
to take charge of the office till i get
back

                                                                  

  slam went the safe door and the
the fluctuating package



knob of the combination rattled as it
whirled then bang went the door of
the cage come on ruthven  by
then summerfield was out from behind
the counter and on his way to the side-
walk

  how long will you be gone joe
inquired reeves

  dont know--dont know anything
you just sit on the lid the agent ran
into the street with ruthven close be-
hind him

  the two laid a bee line for the rail-
road station havent you any idea
what were wanted for summerfield 
queried ruthven

  what is an idea returned the
other as he hurried along i couldnt
apprehend one with a search warrant
my mind is a blank harrington has
cracked the whip and thats my signal
to jump i suppose well know some-
thing about this some time but just now
weve got to surge ahead in the dark
harrington i take it went straight to
the division superintendent of the rail-
road between them theyve cooked up
some scheme or other in mighty short
order what it is is a conundrum and
vve havent any time for a guessing con-
test

  burt city was the headquarters of
the railroad division the station was
a big building with ticket office and
waiting rooms below and all upstairs
given over to durfee the division boss
dispatchers and rooms for other offi-
cials on durfees staff when ruthven
and summerfield reached the station
platform they encountered a headquar-
ters slave coming from the direction
of the roundhouse the mans name
was perkins he was in his shirt sleeves
and wore an eye shade

  hello summerfield said perkins
youre in on this hurry-up business
too eh i heard harrington telephon-
ing you as i left the office

  whats up perk queried the
agent

  a small-sized tornado just blew out
of the old mans private sanctum the
dispatcher was ordered to hold seven-
teen at bluffton first station west i
was told to go over to the yards and
pick up the first engine i could find
near as i can make out the super har-
rington and the rest of you are going
after seventeen the regular west-
bound has been laid out and particular
cain raised with the dispatchers train
sheet the light engine is to have the

right of way and- ah heres long

guess he must be in the party too

  the senior member of the firm of
long  mckenzie came puffing down
the platform at that moment he was
red and perspiring and tremendously
excited wheres durfee he asked
what am i here for mac hadnt got
back to the store so i couldnt bring
him along what in thunder has the
division superintendent been stirring
up 

  were in the dark long same as
you returned summerfield

  was you told to come here

  yes

  ruthven the same

  yes from what i can learn were
all to ride with durfee and harrington
on a light engine to bluffton seven-
teen is to be held there until we can
overhaul her

  long mopped his dripping astounded
face with a red bandanna handkerchief
well ill be ding-busted he ex-
claimed this comes mighty near bein
the limit huh he added heres
a locomotive backin up with a caboose
wonder if thats our special

  must be said perkins its the old
switch bumper sixty-seven the way
car will help to balance her and keep
her from running her nose into the
roadbed

  perkins said no more but plowed
along dutifully toward the stairs that
led to the second-story offices durfee
and harrington had just appeared red-


top-notch magazine

faced and excited and were running to-
ward the way car harrington had
found a linen duster somewhere and a
hat the linen duster was too big for
him and he had rolled back the sleeves
the hat was a soft felt and he had
pulled it down over his skullcap

  get on you fellows  harrington
yelled looking toward ruthven long
and summerfield we cant let any
grass grow under us-weve got to
hustle

  durfee had run forward for a word
with the engineer instructions took no
more than a minute and the extra west
got under  way the superintendent
swinging nimbly up on the steps as the
way car came along the others were
all inside the car and three of them
were palpitating with excitement and
curiosity ruthven had never met dur-
fee and in that crisis no one thought
of giving him an introduction in the
circumstances it was hardly necessary

  whats the row durfee demanded
long i ought to know why youre
taking me away from the store like
this

  well not keep you from your busi-
ness very long answered the superin-
tendent ten minutes at bluffton will
be enough and then well all come back
maybe well be gone an hour all told
providing qualified harrington
wildly nothing happens

  durfee nodded grimly thats right
harrington he agreed and well
hope for the best

  what the devil can happen in-
quired long in a puzzled voice as he
peered through a window about the
only thing im afeared of is that this
bobtailed train will turn a somersault
into the right of way whats the use
of goin so fast

the engineer was certainly hitting
it up the landscape was reeling past
the windows and the way car lurched
and jumped like an untamed broncho
were not telling you fellows every-

thing said the superintendent be-
cause harrington and i do not think
it wise but we need you with us and
the business is important if it wasnt
do you think id lay out the schedule
of seventeen like im doing by thun-
der ive never had anything throw such
a scare into me	

  durfee had his sea legs on and could
walk up and down the car with remark-
able stability this he proceeded to do
from time to time consulting his watch
the wheel flanges screeched on the
curves the way car shivered and rat-
tled and seemed every moment on the
point of going to pieces while black
soft-coal smoke floated back from the
switch bumper and buried the car ab
intervals

  long left the bench at the side of the
caboose and made his way to a chair
that was riveted to the floor there he
sat in front of a small desk hanging
onto the chair arms for dear life and
watching pictures of prize fighters and
actresses dance around the little bulk-
head to which the desk was secured
he was consumed with curiosity re-
garding the object of that wild ride and
yet he was so afraid the caboose would
leave the rails that he had no heart for
asking questions

  and anyhow durfee and harring-
ton were saying nothing about tlieir rea-
sons for overhauling seventeen as the
superintendent had said they were
keeping that to themselves there was
a tenseness in the air however that
hinted of great and awful possibilities
durfee continued to walk back and
forth and harrington evinced his dis-
ordered state of mind by pulling at his
side whiskers

  ruthven and summerfield braced
themselves side by side on a bench the
former reflected in a milder degree
the vague fears of trouble playing in the
express agents face

  the super and the traveling agent
have got us all guessing ruthven said
the fluctuating package



into summerfields ear but why the
deuce they want me along is the hardest
thing to understand

  well see later on the other re-
turned were close to bluffton now
and when were there the secret will
come out

  a half dozen houses a station about
the size of a bandbox and a water tank
comprised the settlement of bluffton
ruthven peering from the car as they
slowed to a halt could also see a num-
ber of stock pens the place was a cat-
tle-shipping point it seemed barely
had the extra stopped when durfee
made for the door all out he
called

  the five in the way car tumbled from
the forward platform seventeen was
waiting just ahead some of the pas-
sengers were stretching their legs in the
vicinity of the station and good-natur-
edly putting up with the delay others
who had close connections to make at
a point farther on were not so good-
natured the fireman of seventeens
engine was on the ground and calmly
using an oil cam the engineer leaned
against one of the big drivers and
watched curiously while the conductor
hurried to meet the division superin-
tendent

  whats all the trouble mr durfee
asked the conductor

  nothing that concerns you leason
durfee answered making his way to-
ward the express car the side door
of this car was open and the messenger
stood within it our business is here
added durfee and climbed up with a
helping hand from the messenger

  harrington followed and he turned
to beckon imperatively to long ruth-
ven and summerfield

  youve got a prepaid parcel for
thomas barton consignees long 
mckenzie burt city said the travel-
ing agent lets see it billings care-
ful with it  he cautioned

  billings was careful with the package
a

and careful to conceal his surprise
here it is said he and offered the
barton shipment

  with evident apprehension harring-
ton took the package in his hands al-
most instantly his face cleared of worry
i guess this is a case of all cry and no
wool durfee said he in evident relief
were hornswoggled if this weighs
more than six pounds ill eat it
pshaw  grunted durfee as he took
the package no ten pounds there
he drew a hand across his forehead
i reckon wrere safe he added

  a howl of wrath came from long
is this what you snatched me away
from the emporium for that gol-
binged package again say this joke
has gone far enough

chapter vi

changing his plans

i ongs angry remarks passed un-
heeded harrington turned to
summerfield is that the package that
passed through your office he asked
yes the agent answered

  you are absolutely positive are
you

  yes

  how about you mr ruthven tell
me would you declare under oath
that that package is the one which you
and summerfield found to weigh nine
pounds and then six

  ruthven took the package in his own
hands and found the penciled mark
he had placed on it for identification

  im positive it is the same package
he declared

  mr long what have you to say
this thing makes me mighty tired
was the disgusted response thats all
ive got to say nobody seems to have
any horse sense it was bad enough
to have summerfield go of the jump
but to have the foolishness spread the
way it has is enough to make a man
ashamed of the human race thats


top-notch magazine

the package we sent say look here
once

  he grabbed the parcel untied it un-
wrapped it removed the cover of the
heavy pasteboard box and held up the
tan bluchers with the eighteen-inch tops
jest boots he shouted waving the
footgear boots for tom barton at
dry wash hang it theyll be worn
out afore they ever git to barton at
this rate

  harrington took the boots replaced
them in the box carefully rewrapped
and retied the package and handed it
back to billings

  thats enough grunted durfee i
guess weve assassinated the time-table
sufficiently with this wild-goose chase
all out you men for the extra and
well let seventeen proceed

  harrington followed durfee out of
the express car and ruthven and long
and summerfield followed harrington
let her go said the superintendent
to the conductor and the latter yelled
all ab-o-o-ard got the passengers
back in the coaches and gave the signal
to the engineer

  durfee went into the little station
tosend a message to the dispatcher and
harrington trailed along ruthven
summerfield and long remained on the
platform and watched seventeen pull
out just then a face at one of the car
windows caught ruthvens attention
he gave an exclamation stood irreso-
lute for a moment and then ran to
board the rear platform of the last car

  summerfield he called telephone
hoover that ill be back to the ranch
to-morrow that was all he had time
to say

  his companions on the platform were
surprised at this unexpected move
whats the matter with him asked
long

  give it up answered summerfield
guess he saw somebody he knew on
seventeen and went along to have a
visit

  must have wanted a visit pretty tar-
nation badgrunted the other

  in truth ruthven had seen a man
whom he knew but he had not boarded
seventeen in order to visit him the
last time ruthven had seen that par-
ticular person had been in the catskill
mountains near the town of cairo and
a little nearer to the village of purling
in new york the fellow was a crook
and had stolen ten thousand dollars
from the country home of a broker
where ruthven had been staying for a
few days his name was morrison
and he had been nicknamed the
weasel he was a most accomplished
cracksman and was even then being
searched for by the new york authori-
ties

  ruthven was stunned with surprise
at the fleeting glimpse he obtained of
weasel morrisons face morrison was
far from his thoughts and the very
last man in the world he would have
dreamed of seeing destiny plays some
queer pranks however and perhaps it
was not so odd that morrison should
be in the west -since the east had be-
come too hot to hold him the strange
part of it was that morrison should
have been on seventeen that ruthven
should have happened to be with the
party that had overhauled the train
and that at the last moment he should
have seen morrisons face at the win-
dow of the moving coach

  ruthven was impulsive and he had
acted solely upon impulse at bluffton
as he walked into the coach and seated
himself his mind had already begun
to debate the advisability of the sud-
den move he had made

  in the first place the man might not
be weasel morrison at all ruthven
had a keen eye and a good memory
for faces but he had had only a quick
look at one face in a car whose win-
dows furnished a broadside of faces
it might easily prove that he was mis-
taken besides what was he to do even
the fluctuating package



if the man really turned out to be
weasel morrison

  on at least one account ruthven
would much have preferred that mor-
rison should keep his liberty his cap-
ture meant an airing in court of the
lawless work in the catskills and a
dragging in the mire of dishonor of
the name of a classmate that class-
mate was now recovering the ground
his false step had lost for him and it
might cost him dear to have his error
published by morrison but neverthe-
less ruthven felt that the law required
a duty of him

  i hope the fellow isnt morrison
he said to himself as he got up to go
into the coach ahead to carry his inves-
tigations further

  before he could reach the front plat-
form the conductor entered the car
jupiter exclaimed the trainman i
thought you were with the superintend-
ents party	

  i -as answered ruthven but i
thought i saw somebody i knew on the
train as it pulled by and i jumped on
the last car

  make a mistake

  i dont know yet just come this
way with me for a minute

  lie stepped out on the swaying plat-
lorrhs between the cars and peered
through the glass top of the door of
the second coach the conductor fol-
lowed him obligingly

  see that man in the gray cap sit-
ting on the left side about the middle
of the car ruthven asked

  oh that fellow yes i see him
he got aboard in dakota somewhere
and is traveling to dry wash

  you dont happen to know his name
i suppose

  hardly but- the conductor

paused evidently turning some matter
over in his mind come back into the
rear car a moment he added presently

  ruthven went with him and they sat
down together in a forward seat

  are you acquainted in burt city
the trainman went on

  a little

  do you know miss lois mckenzie
of that place

  ruthven was startled somewhat by
this question why had the conductor
dragged miss mckenzie into the dis-
cussion 

  yes he answered i am acquainted
with miss mckenzie

  then perhaps i can give you a line
on who that man in the gray cap is
miss mckenzie boarded this train at
williamsburg and rode to burt city
she sat with that man part of the way
and seemed to know him maybe if
hes a mutual friend you can now guess
who he is

  if lies a friend of miss mcken-
zies said ruthven then he isnt the
one i know at all ill pay my fare to
the next station and get off there takr
ing the first train back to burt city
i made a fool move when i boarded
seventeen

  well we all make fool moves occa-
sionally said the conductor in an at-
tempt to be soothing okaday is your
stop but you wont be able to get a
train back until late this afternoon
he took the bill ruthven handed him
and returned some change any idea
what durfee had up his sleeve back at
bluffton he queried

  not the least

  the conductor moved on looking
somewhat incredulous ruthven did
not notice the look for he was thinking
of his folly in losing a whole day when
he should have been attending to the
foremans business at the bank in burt
city

  when the train halted at okaday
which appeared to be a town of con-
siderable size a man with a truckload
of express matter was pounding on the
closed door of the express car whats
the matter in there the man with the
truck was asking of a brakeman


top-notch magazine

  something unusual seemed to have
happened and ruthven strolled forward
alongside of the train at the window
through which he had seen the man in
the gray hat he paused for a closer
scrutiny no passenger showed through
the glass the sinister face under the
grrv hat had disappeared

  moved to gome other seat i sup-
pose reflected ruthven well it
doesnt make much difference anyway
-now he proceeded on to the ex-
press car

  here there was a good deal of ex-
citement a brakeman had entered the
car by an end door finding it unlocked
he pushed open the side door and
thrust out his head excitedly some-
thing wrong in here he announced to
the conductor and another brakeman
who stood beside the rnan with the
truck billings the messenger is all
doubled up in a heap guess hes sick
or something

  the conductor climbed to the truck
and then into the car he was followed
by the other two men ruthven curi-
ous and impelled by a feeling that he
might somehow have a personal inter-
est in developments got upon the truck
and peered into the coach

  a brakeman had billings head on his
knee and the conductor was bringing
a cup of water from the tank the mes-
senger was reviving even before the
cold water was flung in his face

  what is the matter inquired ruth-
ven stepping off the truck and through
the wide doorway

  maybe billings hurt himself said
the conductor or maybe some one else
hurt him well know in a minute i
dont like the look of things the
brakeman says he found the end door
unlocked billings isnt usually care-
less

  the messenger at that moment lifted
his head from the brakemans knee and
sat up one hand went to the back
of his head some-somebody hit

me he remarked looking around daz-
edly

   when billings  asked the conduc-
 tor who was it

   not more than two or three miles
out of bluffton said the messenger
gathering his wits to deal with the
puzzling question who it was is more
than i know i was sitting in that
chair-he pointed to an armchair near
the middle of the car-and my back
was to the rear door the fellow who-
ever he was crept in on me and gave
me a crack from behind thats all i
remember till just now color flushed
his pallid face as he struggled to his
feet is anything gone he asked
wtildly

   the scoundrel didnt have time to
steal anything billings said the con-
ductor if you were only two miles
out of okaday when he bowled you
over

   he must have been a robber i in-
sisted billings

   then he miscalculated the distance
 to okaday and didnt have time to get
 hold of anything valuable can you
 take on the stuff here edson will
 help you and he nodded to one of
 the brakemen

   ruthven started to leave the car
when his eye lighted upon the barton
package and he picked it up a sharp
breath fluttered through his lips the
package weighed more than six pounds
-he knew it turning the package
end-up he looked for the pencil mark
it was there so durfee and harring-
ton had made a mistake after all the
barton parcel was overweight just as
when it had left burt city

chapter vii

a flash in the pan

after seventeen had left okaday
leason the conductor made his
tour of the coaches collecting tickets
and cash fares he was so startled
the fluctuating package



he almost dropped his nickel-plated
punch when his eyes fell on ruthven

  seems like you just cant tear your-
self away from this train said he

  changed my mind again remarked
ruthven how is the express mes-
senger 

  hes got a sore head but thats all
billings was mighty lucky the way that
matter turned out not a thing gone
hes checked over his stuff that rob-
ber made a slick move but it was only
a flash in the pan where have you
made up your mind to go

  dry wash

  leason collected the amount due the
railroad company and then passed on
to the end of the train

  presently he came back and dropped
into a vacant seat beside ruthven
youve got the straight of that ex-
press-car business havent you he
queried one of the passengers was
the holdup man between bluffton and
okaday he sneaked to the express car
and either he found the door open or he
picked the lock he worked quietly
and billings didnt hear him when
he got into the car he hit the messenger
over the head and that gave him a
chance to do as he pleased but he
didnt have time to monkey with the
safe where all the stuff worth while
was locked up you see we were al-
most within sight of okaday and the
robber had made a bad mistake in judg-
ing distances all he could do was to
drop off the car when we began to slow
up for the town and thats what he
did i told you that your friend had
bought a ticket to dry wash

  ruthven nodded dont call the fel-
low my friend though said he if
he had been the man i thought he was
he wouldnt have been that

  well that chap is missing from
among the passengers ive gone
through the train and he isnt aboard

ruthven started with surprise
that means then he returned that

he was the one who made the attempt
on the express car

  i dont see how else you can figure
it his ticket read to dry wash and
he disappeared between bluffton and
okaday why did he get off take
it from me he boarded seventeen with
the idea of rifling the messengers safe
billings had more than twenty thousand
dollars in cash in his iron box that
is why i declare that billings was
mighty lucky

  by george exclaimed ruthven
all this tallies with the character of
weasel morrison that is who the
fellow was and i was not mistaken
after all

  you know him eh

  i know of him he pulled off a
robbery in the catskill mountains some
time ago and that also turned out to
be a flash in the pan i was staying
at the country home of a broker named
ncyes and morrison made off with
ten thousand dollars from a safe in
noyes study i had a little to do with
getting the money back and while that
was going on i had an experience with
the weasel that fixed his face in my
mind at bluffton as seventeen was
pulling out i thought i saw morrison
at a coach window i was so sure it
was morrison that i boarded the train

then later when you told me-

  he paused greatly disturbed in mind
he was coming to the point where lois
mckenzie figured prominently in the
affair and he was sorry he had pur-
sued the question so far

  i believe i get you said leason
i told you that miss mckenzie rode
on seventeen from williamsburg to
burt city and that she sat with this
-er-morrison and talked with him
miss mckenzie is a fine girl and her
father is a member of the legislature
and it isnt possible she would be on
speaking terms with a crook that is
the way you reasoned when you finally


top-notch magazine

decided that you didnt know the man
is that right

  yes answered ruthven slowly and
a bit reluctantly of course there is
some mistake somewhere miss mc-
kenzie has no crooks on her list of ac-
quaintances she took the only unoc-
cupied seat and just happened to pick
out the one with morrison they
merely talked a little as chance ac-
quaintances sometimes will naturally
she had no idea what sort of a man
morrison was

  i guess thats the size of it leason
agreed that side of the question
and he shot a covert glance at the other
man had nothing to do with your
changing your mind and going on to
dry wash had it

  this manifestly was none of the con-
ductors business still in the circum-
stances he might be excused for put-
ting the question

  certainly not ruthven answered
shortly

  the mysterious barton package was
what had caused ruthven to change
his mind and continue the unexpected
journey to dry wash his curiosity
had been so profoundly stirred by that
last increase in the parcels weight that
he had suddenly decided to follow it
through to the other ranch he knew
that his absence would not inconveni-
ence hoover particularly and his fears
had been somewhat aroused by the
strange actions of durfee and harring-
ton he did not take the trouble to
explain all this to leason

  are you acquainted in dry wash
pursued the conductor

  never have been there thomas
barton who has a ranch near the town
is my uncle my name is ruthven
barton was well and favorably known
all over montana most of the people
too were aware that his brother-in-
law was the great emmet k ruth-
ven

  thunder mused leason then

you must be the lewis ruthven ive
been hearing about-the chap who had
a flare-up with emmet k and was
sent to montana as a- the con-
ductor paused his excitement was be-
traying him too far and he realized it
suddenly

  ruthven stiffened i dont know
what you heard nor whom you heard
it from said he but there was no
flare-up as you call it between my
father and me emmet k is one of
the finest fellows that ever lived there
may have been a slight misunderstand-
ing between us but when he gets back
to the home office from san francisco
he will know just where i stand

  beg your pardon mr ruthven
mumbled  leason i didnt mean to
blat out the rumors that are going
around emmet k is famous through-
out the west and whatever concerns
him is considered public property

  im standing on my own feet said
ruthven with a considerable show of
feeling i dont care to be famous
or infamous just because my father
happens to be well known what i
want to do is to make my own way and
not pose as the family pet at uncle
toms lower ranch im pulling down
fifty dollars a month and hoover the
foreman says i earn every cent of it
emmet k isnt the fellow to push a
man ahead just because the man hap-
pens to be his son and im glad of
it i wish youd tell anybody who gets
curious about me that so far as em-
met k -is concerned im just his
brothers hired man and no more to
him in a business way than the other
hired men in his employ will you do
that 

  i will glad to do it assured the
conductor vehemently youre the
right sort mr ruthven he added ap-
provingly and got up as the train
slowed for the next station

  seventeen was due in dry wash at
half past two but owing to the delays
the fluctuating package



it did not arrive until four oclock
ruthven when he stepped down from
the train found himself in a town not
much larger than bluffton he watched
while a few packages were thrown out
of the express car and gathered up by
a man in overalls among the parcels
was the one for barton the man car-
ried his load to a store building across
the street from the railroad station and
ruthven followed him

  a sign outside the store bore the
legend b grandy general mer-
chandise hanging to this sign were
two others one reading post office
and the other express office the
post office was partitioned off next one
of the front windows and the express
office was just back of it on the same
side of the store

  the man in overalls dumped his load
behind the express-office counter and a
youth of sixteen or seventeen came in
with a very slim mail bag and disap-
peared behind a barricade of letter
boxes a young woman in a calico
gown was waiting on a customer in the
rear of the establishment these three
the man the youth and the girl evi-
dently comprised the working force

  i wish youd put that package for
thomas barton on the scales mr
grandy said ruthven leaning over the
counter

  the man in overalls looked up and
his faded blue eyes filled with suspicion
what business is it o yours he in-
quired

  none at all but i think the package
is overweight and i am rather inter-
ested in seeing it weighed im from
ranch two andmr barton is my
uncle

  this statement did not impress
grandy he piled up the barton pack-
age with the rest of the incoming ex-
press matter and made no move to put
it on the scales

  when will that package go out to

the ranch  ruthven inquired taking
another tack

  it wont go out to-day was the
answer  cause nate wylie is down
with mountain fever he was shakin
like all get out when he made his trip
to town yesterday nate does the haul-
ing between dry wash and the ranch
somebody else i reckon will drive the
wagon to-morrow

  if youll let me receipt for the pack-
age ill get a horse and take it out to
uncle tom this afternoon

  not by a jugful returned grandy
mebby that package is vauyble and
mebby youre a confidence man never
seen you before somebody i know
from the ranch gits this piece o freight
and not any stranger

  all right said ruthveti cheerfully
is there a hotel i can stop at until
some one comes in from the ranch
i want to ride out there with the man
who does the freighting

  the hotel is right next to this store
was the reply theyll take care o
you for the night ruthven then wtent
out i dont like the way that feller
acts went on grandy to the girl who
had finished waiting on the customer
and had walked toward the front door

  youre foolish popt she answered
i havent ever seen a finer-looking
young man than he is what did he
say his name was

  he didnt say all he told me wras
that tom barton was his uncle any-
body could drop in here and say that
now ill put that package on the scales
jest to satisfy myself

  he did so gosh he exclaimed
its marked six pounds and weighs

ten i-

  weighs ten eh called a voice from
the platform in front of the open door

  grandy looked up to see the smiling
face of ruthven the latter still smil-
ing turned and vanished past the win-
dow talk about nerve grumbled


top-notch magazine

grandy now i knozv he aint
square

  at the hotel ruthven was given a
pleasant welcome he was shown to a
comfortable room and after a while
was supplied with a good supper that
night he slept like a top undisturbed
by any apprehensions or surmises about
either the barton package or weasel
morrison when he came down to
breakfast next morning the landlord
handed him a newspaper as he started
into the dining room

  its a dailyfrom helena the land-
lord explained and just got here

  ruthven seated himself at the table
ordered ham and eggs buckwheat cakes
and coffee and began reading while he
waited for his breakfast a moment
later his eye caught a headline big
scare at burt city and below that
line was this division superinten-
dent durfee holds up a train to look
for infernal machine and finds pair
of boots

  ruthven whistled in astonishment
then he began to read forgetting all
about his breakfast

chapter viii

a pair of six-guns

the article was not a long one but
some enterprising press associa-
tion had evidently got hold of the facts
and telegraphed them all over the state
very likely durfee and harrington in
view of the failure of their expedition
to make good their fears had released
the information they had been keeping
to themselves if so on reading that
press report they must have regretted
taking the public into their confidence
the paper treated the affair as a huge
j oke

  not often is it the lot of a pair of boots
to throw a scare into the division superin-
tendent of a railroad and the traveling agent
of an express company and yet that is pre-
cisely what a pair of tan bluchers with eight-

een-inch tops did to messrs durfee and har-
rington furthermore on account of those
boots a passenger train was held up for an
hour until it could be overtaken by a special
and one entire division of a railroad experi-
enced an attack of cold chills and was gen-
erally set by the ears messrs durfee and
harrington had an idea that the package con-
taining the boots contained a clockwork
bomb and it seemed necessary for the two
to overhaul the package in person before the
boots exploded 

  here followed a brief and more or
less serious account of the wild pur-
suit of seventeen by the party in the
way car and of the overpowering re-
lief experienced by durfee and har-
rington when they found the tan blu-
chers in the package instead of an in-
fernal machine and then came this
illuminating bit

  two weeks ago a package was received by
the express agent in monte carlo montana
it weighed three pounds when the agent took
it in and the weight had jumped to live
pounds when he sent it out in some way a
clock of peculiar construction had been smug-
gled into the package for the messenger
heard a ticking inside and the agent vows
there was no such ticking while the package
was being taken over the counter be this
as it may the innocent-appearing parcel let
go in the town of duane making kindling
of one perfectly good express car but for-
tunately and miraculously injuring no one
not even the messenger durfee and har-
rington had this matter in mind when they
started in pursuit of the boots in the cir-
cumstances they are excusable but sup-
pose the package had really contained a
bomb and that the bomb had exploded while
the passenger train was waiting at the bluff-
ton station to be overhauled in that event
durfee might have been sorry he had not
wired the messenger to throw the package
from the car with a pair of tongs while no
 proceeded on about its business

  jupiter murmured ruthven as he
laid aside his paper and started in on
his breakfast so that was the reason
for harringtons rush for the superin-
tendents office and the chase after sev-
enteen  the explanation of the cause
of that fiasco however doesnt shed a
ray of light upon the true mystery of
that barton package its weight be-
the fluctuating package



comes plus or minus at any old time
and without rhyme or reason the
package has never been investigated
so far as i know when it weighed
more than six pounds i wish i could
have persuaded grandy to turn it over
to me possibly i can get a chance at
it when the man comes in to take it
out to the ranch

  when he had finished his breakfast
ruthven went out on the hotel porch
and seated himself in a comfortable
chair weasel morrison was much in
his mind and likewise lois mckenzie
these two presented a baffling prob-
lem and the more his mind dwelt upon
their ride together from williamsburg
to burt city the more bewildered he
became

  he was still struggling in the mental
mire when a mountain wagon drawn
by tvo fiery half-tamed bronchos came
racing down the street there was only
one man in the wagon-a cowboy by
the look of him-and he had the lines
wrapped around his hands and was
sawing them back and forth

  one horse appeared to be trying des-
perately to leap over the other the
driver was shouting all the time and
what he said was very expressive of
the state of his feelings he managed
to guide the team to the hitching pole
in front of grandys establishment
there one broncho tried to go into the
store while its mate made an unsuccess-
ful attempt to climb a telegraph pole

  you ginger whooped the driver
say i got a blame good notion to
skin ye alive pete you mouse-colored
no-account son o the ole nick if i
had you to the ranch id stand you on
your bloomin head whoa now con-
sarn ye

  he fell out of the wagon gathered
himself up and finally managed to get
the team hitched then he got on the
platform pulled off his wide-brimmed
hat and mopped his brow with a hand-
kerchief

  those bronks are kind of festive
eh william remarked grandy ap-
pearing in the store door

  you might call it that grandy
was the aggrieved reply and you might
call it pure cussedness them two was
only broke to saddle last fall and to
harness this spring not before this
morning was they ever hitched to-
gether theyre real unsociable seems
like

  hows nate wylie 

  sick abed i had to come to town
in his place old mans feet are both-
erin him a heap and he says by now
you ort to have a pair o boots he or-
dered from burt city moren a month
ago he cant wear nothin but a cer-
tain kind o footgear and the last pair
he got from burt city would be all
right yet a while if some thievin four-
footed critter hadnt got away with one
of em i allow its sam haynes
coyote dog but we cant prove it on
the animile with only half the old
pair left bartons got to have the new
ones have they come

  theres a package here and i allow
its just about the size to hold a pair of
boots but its awful heavy william
light or heavy i got to put right
back with that package put a bag o
flour a side o bacon and a case o
termaters in the wagon ill get the
package and what mail there is and
hustle to run out the return trail
why dont you drive a team thats
got some respect for you william
well the old man wants ginger and
pete to git used to each other and so
he put it up to me to drive em to town
ill bet theyll know somebodys behind
em before we get back to the mussel-
shell  ive stood about all them didoes
im goin to

  william went into the store and
grandy followed him heres the man
im waiting for thought ruthven
and ill ride with him out to the
ranch


top-notch magazine

  he went into the hotel and paid his
bill then he walked over to grandys
to interview william the latter was
standing by the counter of the express
department tucking several letters and
papers into the pocket of his coat and
eying with some concern the package
that lay in front of him the store
assistant was carrying out the provi-
sions and putting them in the wagon

  just charge that extry express to
barton grandy william was saying
i aint got a red with me

  sure agreed grandy

  are you from tom bartons ranch
inquired ruthven stepping up to the
cowboy

  the latter looked around measured
the speaker with keen eyes and appar-
ently was favorably impressed i am
he answered

  my names ruthven -
the others eye brightened lewis
ruthven he asked

  yes i reached town last night and
want to get to the musselshell may
i ride with you

  well i guess william backed
away and continued to stare at ruth-
ven so youre the cimiroon that laid
out big eph huh that bully and i
come together oncet when i was down
at the lower ranch and i couldnt work
for all of a week arterward you back-
heeled him they say and tipped him
headfirst into a water trough then you
pulled him out o the trough and
pounded his head agin the side o the
cookhouse cleanin up on him complete
a lot of us didnt allow they was a
man in montana could do it youre
emmet ks son all right shake  my
names martin bill martin im sure
glad to meet up with the man that
trimmed big eph

  this was the first intimation ruthven
had had that his differences with big
eph had traveled so far but he was
glad if the reports had won him the
good will of martin

  hes right husky for an easterner
remarked grandy to martin i reck-
oned emmet ks son would be more
pampered like sort of run to seed with
luxury and the good things o life but
this man looks like the real goods
ruthven laughed going right back
to the ranch martin he queried

  right off i got some boots here
for the old man and hes frettin for
em i spose you got about three
trunks four grips and a foldin bath-
tub hey  git em loaded then and
well hike

  im traveling light this trip all
ive got with me is what i stand in
bully for you come on 

  martin picked up the package took
it out on the platform and tossed it
into the wagon as it slammed into
the wagon box the startled bronchos
made another attempt to get into the
store and to climb the telegraph pole

  aint it scandalous the way them
critters act asked martin in profound
disgust i reckon well have to ma-
neuver some in gittin em unhitched
and headed along the out trail you
climb in and take the lines while i cast
off

  ruthven obeyed martin got the
hitching straps loose and then the in-
stant they were freed and before he
could get into the wagon the team
jumped for the middle of the street
they did not go far however before
ruthven stopped them by main strength
he did it so well that martin com-
plimented him in glowing terms and
scrambled into the seat beside him

  youd nacherly think said martin
taking the reins that fifteen mile of
runnin from the ranch to town would
smooth the kinks out of them but no
theyre just beginnin to feel their oats
keep your eye on the stuff in the rear
and ill let the cusses flicker hike
you heathens he added with a yell
and away went the team on the jump
at least three miles of trail were
the fluctuating package



 covered before the bronchos showed
 any signs of lessening their speed
 after that by degrees they slowed to
 a more comfortable pace ruthven
 reached around and picked up the pack-
 age it was still at its top weight so
 far as he could judge

   id like to open this and take a look
 at the boots martin said ruthven

  that wouldnt be accordin to
 league rules would it the cowboy
 answered the package is bartons
 im just curious thats all this
 package formed my main reason for
 coming to dry wash and he briefly
 explained about the mysterious differ-
 ences in weight which the parcel ex-
 hibited from time to time

   oh shucks exclaimed martin
 that sounds like fool talk but you
 can see whats inside just as soon as
 we git to where were goin your
 uncles plumb anxious about them boots
 and hell open the package the minute
 he gets his hands on it it wouldnt
 be the proper caper for you and me
 to open it you dont really think that
 package gits heavier and lighter all by
 itself do you

   i dont know what to think ive
 been guessing about the matter good

and hard i-

   right there he broke off his remarks
 suddenly a man had jumped out from
 behind a clump of brush at the road-
 side and the horses had halted so ab-
  ruptly that the wagon almost ran over
 them the man had a cap pulled down
 over his eyes and his coat collar turned
 up about his ears and he was leveling
 two large and businesslike revolvers
 between the bronchos heads he had a
 clear and comprehensive view of the
 pair on the seat of the mountain wagon
 one weapon was trained upon martin
 and the other upon ruthven

   what dyou know about that ex-
 claimed the startled cowboy neigh-
 bor are you tryin to stick us up if

you are youll find poor pickin so far
as this hits me

  another man his face similarly cov-
ered emerged from the brush and
started toward the wagon

  you got a package there for tom
barton said the man with the guns
if you have toss it over i need a
pair of boots myself

  just at that moment ginger and pete
had some frenzied fancies and under-
took maneuvers both startling and un-
expected they jumped forward and
sideways and ruthvens heels went into
the air and he turned a back somer-
sault into the rear of the wagon what
martin was doing at the same time
he was in no position to determine

chapter ix

following up suspicions

ne event followed another so rap-
idly that ruthven could not keep
track of them he realized dimly that
the horses were running away and that
he was being bounced around in the
back part of the wagon in imminent
danger of going overboard he had
vague uncertain glimpses of a bag of
flour a case of tomatoes and a side
of bacon dancing in the air and then
after a few seconds of this demoraliz-
ing experience something like an earth-
quake took hold of the mountain wagon
and shook it as a terrier shakes a rat

  following this the storm gave way
to a fearsome calm ruthven was dizzy
and dazed the first thing he compre-
hended was that he was no longer in

                                 o

swift and violent motion he sat up
and by degrees took firmer hold of his
unsteady faculties under him was the
hard earth and all around lay frag-
ments of the mountain wagon a
wheel beautifully smashed was within
easy reach of his hand an axle stuck
out of the ground a few yards off with
another wheel fairly intact on its upper
end the boards that had formed the


top-notch magazine

box had been wrenched one from an-
other and were scattered hither and
yon a little way off at the side of
the tjail lay a large bowlder it was
the reef on which the wagon had been
wrecked

  ruthven after making sure that he
had escaped with only a few minor
bruises and contusions arose to his feet
and looked along the trail for the
horses they were not in sight fac-
ing the other way he tried to discover
some trace of the two holdup men
this was equally fruitless in the mid-
dle distance however something moved
which upon investigation proved to be
william martin he was on the ground
and struggling to get rid of the dash-
board through which he had run his
head to the shoulders

  are you hurt martin  ruthven
asked

  not a hull lot i reckon pull this
bloomin thing off o me will you 

  ruthven removed the dashboard i
guess the horses ran away he re-
marked uselessly

  oh no jeered the cowboy it aint
possible they just started for the
musselshell in a hurry and didnt stop
to consider i aint a-wonderin they
got skcered them road agents cer-
tainly threw a crimp into me what
can you expect o bronks when a rea-
sonin human cant put up with such
doins 

  he hoisted himself erect and gazed
northward i reckon ginger and pete
are halfway to the ranch by now he
went on and turned for a look the
other way highwaymen aint in sight
nuther we must be a plumb mile
from where they tried to stop us he
added quizzically which ud you
ruther be robbed or run away with

  hobsons choice martin said
ruthven with a laugh it was out of
the frying pan and into the fire seems
to me

  i was all right till the seat jounced

out resumed martin and when that
went i went along the ground
histed itself and hit me an awful crack
blamed if i know where or how i
picked up the dashboard there was
a kind of blank after i come down and
when i got back to earth i was laborin
to git clear of that front end o the
wagon i allow that vee-hick-le is be-
yond mendin this ort to convince
the old man that ginger and pete aint
got the right dispositions to drive
double or-

  he bit off his words abruptly say
he asked in trepidation i wonder
what-alls become o them boots

  wed better hunt around and find
out suggested ruthven the rob-
bers mentioned the boots if i remem-
ber

  they sure did wasnt that a funny
stunt holdin us up just for nothin
but to annex the old mans footgear
come on and lets hunt

  they went back to the bowlder that
had played such havoc with the wagon
but could not find the parcel in the
wreckage then following the route
taken by the runaway horses they pro-
ceeded on and on sharply scanning the
ground as they went the first thing
they found was the box that had held
the tomatoes it was broken and empty
the cans were scattered in all direc-
tions later they found the flour and
presently the bacon then just as they
were about to lose hope they happened
upon the package it was partly de-
molished the wrapper was torn the
cord was broken and the top of the
pasteboard box was off one of the
tan bluchers had kicked through and
only its laced top lay in the original
container the other boot was with it

  gosh im glad o that breathed
martin thankfully i dont care a
whoop about the wagon but if any-
thing had happened to them boots the
old man would never have forgiven
me
the fluctuating package



  ruthven picked up the tan bluchers
and looked them over curiously there
was nothing inside nor outside to arouse
the least suspicion he investigated the
smashed pasteboard box the torn wrap-
per and even the cord there was ab-
solutely no clew to the mystery that
had surrounded the package ever since
mckenzie had passed it over the coun-
ter of the burt city express office at
one side of the soiled and dusty wrap-
per ruthven found the penciled cross
which he had placed on the package for
purposes of identification

  whats on your mind asked mar-
tin

  oh nothing much answered ruth-
ven wearily ive had a look inside
the package when it weighed the heavi-
est and all ive found is the footgear
this is enough to give a man a brain
storm

  dont pester your mind with things
you cant understand advised the cow-
boy thats the shortest cut you can
take to the crazy house when ginger
and pete git to the ranch some un will
drive this way with another wagon to
pick us up i reckon we better collect
all the freight in one place and then
sit down on it and wait

  this was a good idea the cans of
tomatoes some of them badly dented
were gathered in and heaped in a pile
the flour was carried to the same spot
and then the bacon on top of the
plunder were placed tom bartons
boots while ruthven worked he was
thinking

  the man who had jumped into the
road in front of the bronchos and lev-
eled the six-guns was one whom ruth-
ven was confident he had never seen
before his voice had apparently not
been disguised in the least and it was
strange in ruthvens ears but the
other man the one who had stepped
out of the brush and walked toward
the rear of the wagon had somehow
a familiar aspect without having seen

his face his build and bearing sug-
gested weasel morrison there had
been no time to consider this point be-
fore for the excitement connected with
the bolting of the bronchos had left
ruthven a trifle bewildered and with
other things on his mind now the
matter fairly forced itself on his atten-
tion

  morrison jumping from seventeen
between stations could very easily have
reached dry wash during the previous
night by another passenger train or by
a freight but why was he there on
the trail to the ranch making an at-
tempt to hold up martin and relieve
him of that express package here
was a clew which if carefully followed
might solve the mystery of that barton
shipment

  perhaps an hour and a half after
the smash a man drove from the ranch
with a team and buckboard and halted
near the wreck and the two who were
lounging in the shade by the pile of
provisions

  dont you-all know how to drive
william the newcomer inquired

  dont try to rub it in hank double-
day growled martin i reckon ive
gone through a plenty without takin
any back talk from you a couple o
road agents tried to hold us up and
make ofif with the old mans boots

  go on

  and them long-legged trouble
makers at the pole just nacherly cut
loose and rambled across the landscape
like a pair of skeered coyotes thats
a fact this here and martin indi-
cated the man besid him is mr
lewis ruthven tom bartons nephew
from the lower ranch hes goin along
to the musselshell

  i dont believe ill go along mar-
tin spoke up ruthven

  what

  something ought to be done in the
matter of those two chaps who tried
to rob us i guess ill hoof it back to


top-notch magazine

dry wash and see if they cant be lo-
cated

  howll you locate em you dont
know who to look for better pass it
up and keep on to the ranch with hank
and me

  tell my uncle ill see him later
ruthven answered getting up and
starting southward maybe nothing
will come of this but i think we ought
to try to do something

  well if youve got the bit in your
teeth i wont try to head you off but
say ill wait here while hank drives
you back to town

  the walk will do me good after
being knocked around in the wreck ill
feel all the better for limbering up so
long

  he started on with a swift steady
stride and martin and doubleday
watched him until he was nearly out
of sight

 and thats the cimiroon who
trimmed big eph muttered double-
day too blamed bad he cant get
along with his daddy and is more or
less of a black sheep

  im not takin much stock in that
black-sheep talk said martin i
reckon ruthven is human and has his
failins sames the rest of us but hes
got nerve and build say hank
did you look at the build of him
howd you like to have him tackle you
in a football scrimmage eh  the old
man said he was picked for an all-
america eleven i dont think barton
is down on him much on account of the
fuss he had with his father

  while the two cowboys continued to
talk and to load the freight into the
buckboard ruthven proceeded in the
direction of town he had not many
miles to travel and was not a great
while in covering them but i-t was
nearly two oclock when he turned in
at grandys store

  grandy of course was surprised

didnt you start for the musselshell
he inquired

  yes replied ruthven but i came
back horses ran away and strung the
wagon along the road i waited until
another rig had come for martin and
then i headed this way

  got all vou wanted of ranch life so
           

quick said grandy with a knowing
grin

  ruthven paid no attention to the re-
mark have you seen any strangers
in town grandy he inquired

  one was his reply hes over to
the hotel now

  much obliged said the other and
left the store

  could it be possible that the stranger
was weasel morrison if so then the
fugitive crook was playing a bold hand
to come into dry -wash and stop openly
at the hotel but that was the charac-
ter of the man

  stranger putting up here atkins
he asked of the hotel proprietor who
was sitting on the porch

 yes-arthur robinson of bis-
marck north dakota hes in his room
now the room you had i thought you
had gone to bartons ranch to--

  ruthven did not linger to explain
why he had not continued on to the
ranch but hurried through the hotel
office and up the stairs to the room he
had occupied the night before he wras
ready to take morrison by surprise if
the stranger really proved to be the
crook masquerading under a fictitious
name he rapped on the door

  whats wranted  called a voice-not
morrisons voice but another even more
familiar

  ruthven stifled an exclamation of as-
tonishment and turned the knob the
door was unlocked and flew open a
hatchet-faced man sprang up from a
chair and stared in amaze

  ruthven by thunder he gasped
lewis ruthven of all men in the
wrorld
the fluctuating package



  hackett exclaimed ruthven
hackett the detective who has been
after weasel morrison for weeks and
weeks by george ill bet i know why
youre here

chapter x

getting action

all me robinson said the detec-
tive it is just as easy and wont
give the snap away when you
knocked ruthven i was expecting
some one else i remember now that
you came to montana from the cats-
kills got fired from the school of
mines because you stayed so long in the
east helping millyar your kindness
was a sort of boomerang eh never
mind-dont get hot queer that you
should run in on me like this how
did you know i was in this hotel

  i didnt know it answered ruth-
ven i cant say that i really ex-
pected to find weasel morrison in this
room but i rather hoped that is what
would happen

  why morrison 

  youre here looking for him arent
you havent you been chasing him
ever since he skipped out of the cats-
kills

  dont publish it anyhow said the
detective there are other things
weasel morrison has done that make
that job in the catskills look like the
work of a piker for weeks he has
known i was after him and yet he has
sown a trail of crime all over the west
ive come within an ace of landing on
him half a dozen times but he always
wriggles through hes the smoothest
cracksman at large in this country to-
day

  why continued the detective he
has invented a kit of tools that would
enable him single-handed to open the
vaults of the subtreasury other crooks
want tools made on the same pattern
and morrison bleeds them well for du-

plicate instruments the weasel with
these devilish inventions has helped
more of his kind into burglar-proof
safes than the police can count i
want to catch that gun and i want
to catch him with his patent kit to
capture morrison and not the tools
would be only half a job to get hold
of both would be the slickest clean-up
that was ever pulled off would mean
a lot for law and order and inciden-
tally would jump yours truly into the
king row

  now hackett went on changing
the subject briskly why did you think
weasel morrison might be in this
room 

  ruthven seated himself then he be-
gan telling of the ride from burt city
to bluffton with durfee to overtake
seventeen the detective smiled i
read about that he interjected ruth-
ven continued with the account of how
he had seen morrisons face at a car
window as seventeen was leaving
bluffton how he had boarded the train
and how an attempt had been made to
rob the express car between bluffton
and okaday

  knew about that too struck in the
detective the other proceeded with
his recital and briefly recounted the at-
tempted holdup on the trail to bar-
tons upper ranch and followed with
a statement of his suspicions concern-
ing one of the robbers

  that was why i returned to dry
wash instead of going on to the mus-
selshell he finished i heard when
i got back that there was a stranger
in town and that he was occupying this
particular room in the hotel so i came

     jj

up

  ruthven had done his talking with-
out the slightest reference to the mys-
terious barton package that was quite
apart from the detectives work he rea-
soned and it was not necessary to start
a bootless discussion

  hackett had bitten off the end of a


top-notch magazine

cigar and was lighting it as ruthven
ended his remarks surrounding him-
self with smoke the criminal hunter
drew into his shell of reflection and re-
mained there for several absorbing min-
utes

  finally he came out of it to say
i came to dry wash hot after mor-
rison he thought he had shaken me
in bismarck north dakota i guess
but i learned he had bought a ticket
for this place and was only a train or
two behind him of course i had my
doubts as to whether morrison had
really come to dry wash tickets are
sometimes bought for a blind i came
on though and went straight to the
deputy sheriff in this place there i
connected with surprise number one
the detective knocked the ash off his
cigar and then resumed  jenkins the
deputysheriff had an anonymous letter
from burt city telling him to warn
every dry wash man with money in
his safe to be on guard and that a
cracksman named weasel morrison was
loose in these parts with criminal in-
tent as a rule anonymous letters never
appeal to me but in the circumstances
this one did jenkins is prowling
around now looking for morrison the
weasel knows me so i am lying low
and waiting for the deputy to report
from this you will see that your in-
formation comes in mighty pat were
closing in on the crook and i believe
were going to get him do you want
to help 

  how will the capture of morrison
affect howard millyar queried ruth-
ven anxiously millyar is trying to
live down that catskills affair but if
the whole story was published broad-
cast-

  it wont be cut in the detective

  morrison will be brought to book for
a crime committed in montana hell
not go back east

  ruthvens face cleared of worry

then i want to help said he what
can i do 

  just tell me where youre going to
be so i can get you in a hurry if nec-
essary dont come near me any more
just flock by yourself and when i need
your assistance ill let you know

  all right agreed ruthven i shall
be right here in this hotel he got up
and started for the door

  youre living in burt city queried
the detective

  on a ranch near there

  have you any idea who it was sent
that anonymous letter to jenkins
no

  keep turning it over in your mind
and see if you can guess the informa-
tion might prove important

  ruthven thereupon left the room
having missed his dinner he was hun-
gry enough to do more than justice to
a good supper after the meal he went
to his room and stretched out on his
bed he was thinking of the anony-
mous letter and somehow coupling it
with the talk lois mckenzie had had
with weasel morrison between wil-
liamsburg and burt city was it pos-
sible that lois had written that un-
signed communication  he could not
believe it he was glad however that
he had not mentioned the girls name
in his talk with the detective

  about nine oclock he undressed
and got into his blankets it was morn-
ing just about dawn when he was
aroused by a soft tap on his door
whos there he called no voice
answered but the tapping continued
leaping out of bed he opened the door
and found the detective in the hall

  dress as quickly as you can said
the detective and come down weve
got our man trapped we may not need
you but theres a man with morrison
and i think its just as well to have
you along

  hackett paused for no further words
and ruthven in some excitement be-
the fluctuating package



gan hustling into his clothes when
he got downstairs he found the detec-
tive and another man on the porch wait-
ing

   jenkins this is mr ruthven said
 the detective we can depend on
 him

  jenkins nodded without speaking
he left the porch and started up the
walk the detective with a jerk of
the head indicated that ruthven was
to follow the deputy sheriff walked
briskly and led the way into a sparsely
built-up street where the houses faced
the railroad tracks he stopped before
a two-story frame structure which was
badly in need of paint

   well go in at the rear said he in
 a low tone to the detective ive ar-
 ranged for that door to be left open
 wed better leave ruthven outside to
 watch-the two of us will be needed
 inside

  correct answered hackett get
that ruthven 

  yes answered the one-time half
back but id like to be where theres
something going on i dont want to
pose as a figurehead

youre not prepared and things
might go hard with you at close quar-
i ters keep your eyes skinned so that
if one of the men tries to slip away
you can stop him

   jenkins had quietly opened a kitchen
 door and the detective trailed after
 him the door closed and for a few
 moments there was silence within the
 house then all at once a wild com-
 motion started a struggle was going
 on furniture crashed the whole house
 seemed to shiver and shake husky
 voices cried out angrily and above all
 arose the wild terrified scream of a
 woman

   ruthvens ears were keen and while
 the disorder was at its height there
 came to him a sharp scraping against
 clapboards around the corner of the
 house darting in that direction he

ca

 observed a man in shirt and trousers
 barefooted and bareheaded racing to-
 ward the railroad tracks it was weasel
 morrison and he was carrying a satchel
 as he ran he had dropped from an
 upper window and apparently had
 eluded successfully the two officers in
 the building

  stop shouted ruthven immedi-
ately taking up the pursuit

  morrison cast a quick glance over
his shoulder and his sinister face dark-
ened he must have recognized ruth-
ven and realized that he owed him an
old score he did not stop of course
on the contrary he gathered himself in
for a fresh burst of spged he was
aiming for the end of the little freight
depot and was dashing along the side
of a big stock pen

  ruthven in spite of his size was a
crack sprinter many a time he had
come down the field like a limited ex-
press train with the pigskin under his
arm crashing through the interference
and showing clean heels to all who
came behind his legs had not lost
much of their speed and now he was
gaining upon morrison at every jump
he was not more than ten yards in the
rear when the fleeing crook vanished
around the corner of the freight depot

  ive got him thought ruthven ex-
ultantly

  but he had to revise this opinion
when he in his turn whirled around
the corner of the freight building mor-
rison was just piling upon a velocipedc
car which stood on the rails opposite
the car stood a pole that held a target
a railroad employee was at the top
of the pole making repairs the little
car belonged to him and he was yell-
ing dire things at morrison

  the crook paid no attention throw-
ing ofif the supplies that lay on a small
platform back of the speeders seat
he placed his satchel where it would
be safe and bent to the foot pedals and
handlebars

  ruthven had traifled his mind to
quick action on many a hard-fought
field now his wits worked with light-
ning rapidity on foot he never could
overhaul morrison with the speeder
rushing along the clicking steel how
was he to follow with any hope of suc-
cess 

  he flashed a keen look around near
the depot was a small shanty in which
the section gang stored a hand car and
tools the shanty was open there
were no laborers about but the hand
car had been pushed out on the main
track

  in six jumps ruthven had reached
the car running with it for a few
yards he gave it a start and then leaped
upon it and caught the handlebars at
once he began to work with all his
might lifting and falling with the bars
and urging the car into a wild clip

  there was to be a race between the
hand car and the speeder ruthven
felt that he had never been in better
trim to put up a good fight and he
still felt sure that he was going to lay
hands on weasel morrison

chapter xi

the famous kit

 mile east of dry wash the single
track crossed a bridge it was a
long bridge and spanned a river that
ran between wide deep banks ruth-
ven had hoped he might overtake
weasel morrison before the chase
brought them to the bridge but he soon
saw that the hope was not to be realized
the hand car was gaining upon the
lighter speeder because of the superior
strength applied to the levers the
gain however was slow

  when morrison was close to the end
of the bridge ruthven who was lift-
ing and bending to his work with clock-
like regularity saw him hurl the satchel
from the speeder into the bushes on
the river bank this seemed a very

queer move for morrison to make and
it was only by a chance that the man
behind saw anything of it the next
moment the speeder was upon the
bridge and a little later the hand car
rumbled out upon it perhaps half a
minute afterward fate played a high
card and brought that flight and pur-
suit to an unexpected termination

  morrison in great excitement sud-
denly applied the brakes and brought
the speeder to a quick stop in the
utmost alarm he piled off the veloci-
pede and started to run back toward
the western bank of the river a view
of ruthven rushing down upon him
caused him to pause

  for a brief space ruthven marveled
at these weird actions of the crook
then as a roar and rattle dinned in
his ears above the rumble of the hand
car it flashed through his mind that a
train was coming from the east the
approach of the train was screened by
a bluff shoulder of rock beyond the
end of the bridge but that it was dan-
gerously close there could be no doubt

  morrison had been nearly two-thirds
of the way across when he had halted
the speeder and ruthven as he bore
down with all his weight on the foot
brake was nearly halfway over mor-
rison following an instant of indeci-
sion whirled to make for the eastern
bank of the river evidently he pre-
ferred taking chances with the oncom-
ing train than with ruthven he was
too late in executing this change of
plan however for he had barely started
his retreat when the nose of the engine
pushed into sight around the curtain
of rock

  consternation seized ruthven the
bridge wasscarcely more than a trestle
and beyond the ends of the ties on
either side there was nothing but space
and the waters below at intervals
beams jutted out from the bridge each
beam supporting a barrel of water for
emergency in case of fire to get out
the fluctuating package



on one of those beams while the train
rushed past would not have called for
any unusual amount of nerve but both
the men were trapped midway between
the beams which were some fifty feet
apart

  it was possible that ruthven could
have gained the nearest water barrel
yet if he had been able to make it he
feared that the hand car on being
tossed from the track might strike him
one expedient after another flashed
through his mind while deep wild blasts
of warning came from the whistle of
the locomotive

  morrison cool enough now that the
first shock of alarm had passed jumped
to the ends of the ties and lowered
himself so that he swung by his arms
beneath the bridge this was the only
course to take that promised safety
and ruthven had already decided upon
it he too gripped the end of a tie
and dangled above the wter

  the bridge was shaking under the
rushing weight of the train it was a
fast freight two crashes in quick suc-
cession could be heard as the pilot
struck the speeder and the hand car
hurling both clear of the bridge and far
out into the river the freight had
almost passed when morrison slipped
from his hold and shot downward

  ruthven could have held on and
drawn himself back to safety after the
caboose had gone by  if he did this
however he feared that morrison might
escape giving his body an outward
swing he let go the tie and fell

  he succeeded in turning himself in
mid-air so that he made a fairly good
dive into the water down and down
he went into the churning waters and
when he came to the surface and cleared
his eyes he could see morrison swim-
ming powerfully for the western bank
the other bank was so steep for a long
distance that a landing there was im-
possible ruthven struck out in the
wake of the crook

  the weasel held the advantage in
this that he was lightly clad ruthven
incumbered with all his clothes had
the harder fight but he was the better
swimmer and held his own in the race
for the bank morrison got ashore
first and dragged himself clear of the
slime and ooze at the rivers margin
his scanty apparel clung to his limbs
and his hair hung down over his face
and eyes he pushed back his drenched
locks gave one look over his shoulder
and began hurrying toward the railroad
track

  ruthven was nearly water-logged as
he came out of the river he had kept
all his clothes but his hat and the water
squirted from his soggy shoes as he
walked halt morrison he yelled
you cant get away

  the crook flung back a shout of de-
fiance and continued  toward the high
bank leading to the bridge approach
ruthven made after him trailing small
rivers of water as he went his clothes
may have been dampened but his ardor
for the chase was in nowise diminished

  at the bushes which covered the rail-
road embankment morrison paused
ruthven saw him drop to his knees and
draw into sight the satchel he had flung
from the speeder opening the satchel
morrison reached into it and jerked
forth a small revolver springing up
he whirled and lifted the weapon

  no more than a dozen feet separated
the two men you halt morrison
cried youve butted into my plans
once too often ruthven you are the
only one between me and liberty and
ive sworn i shall never see the inside
of the pen

  bang went the revolver ruthven
stood unscathed although the range was
well-night point-blank bang bang
bang four times morrison pressed
the trigger and still the big half back
remained erect himself wondering why
he sustained no mortal hurt

  morrison cursed and flung aside the


top-notch

magazine

useless weapon facing about he at-
tempted to claw his way up the brushy
bank but ruthven was upon him in
short order gripped in each others
hands the two rolled about and then
ruthven came uppermost and held his
man helpless in fingers of steel

  just then there was a sound of voices
accompanying a scramble of feet and
ruthven looked around to see four men
hastening toward them two of them
were the detective and the deputy
sheriff the other two evidently were
from the freight train

  hes got him cried hackett jubi-
lantly by thunder ruthven has got
him

  pretty nifty i call that exclaimed
jenkins

  they had a blamed close call said
one of the trainmen i wouldnt have
been in their boots a few minutes back
for a cool million they dropped into
the river and swam out eh but how
in blazes did they come to be on the
bridge with that hand car and speeder
its all right explained jenkins
the smaller chap is a notorious crook
and this other man here is after him
the man is weasel morrison and he
did that job at monte carlo we had
him and a pal bottled up at jennifers
boarding house in dry wash and mor-
rison slipped away from us ruthven
followed him

  good work approved the conduc-
tor of the freight if hes the tinhorn
that blew up the express car see that
hes put through for it thats all

  get up ruthven said the detec-
tive as he and the deputy halted be-
side the two on the ground hes ours
now and well take care of him jupi-
ter but youre as wet as a drowned
rat fine business though 

  ruthven released morrison and arose
to his feet hackett bent down and
pulled the prisoners wrists together
click click came a sharj staccato

double note and the crooks hands were
secured with steel bracelets

  there you are weasel morrison
chuckled jenkins gripping the pris-
oners arms and hoisting him erect by
main strength

  thank your old friend ruthvenfor
this put in the detective your pal
toby lane is a prisoner too you
might call this a clean sweep bolting
from jennifers didnt do you much
good after all eh

  morrison stood sullenly between the
twro officers a melancholy figure in his
wet garments ruthven picked up the
revolver and was examining it

  we heard the shots said jenkins
he did it i suppose none of the
bullets reached you 

  ruthven laughed there were no
bullets jenkins he answered if
there had been id not be here now
two cartridges are left in the cylinder
-and they are blanks

  blanks queried the detective in-
credulously in a canister belonging
to weasel morrison

  show em to me barked the pris-
oner in sudden wrath

  the detective took the weapon from
ruthvens hand broke it and re-
moved one of the two remaining car-
tridges these he showed to morri-
son watching his face curiously the
while the face twisted with demoni-
acal fury

  queered  he fumed queered by
that--- he broke off and his voice
died in a fierce muttering who tipped
me off hackett he demanded the
detective was silent i know the
prisoner went on and ill get even
it was ario mckenzie of burt city
mckenzie the respectable and highly
honored member of the montana leg-
islature the junior partner in the firm
of long  mckenzie ill nail his hide
to the barn you hear me i warned
him whatwould happen if he tried to
give me the dirty end of this and now
the fluctuating package



hell get whats coming it wasnt
ruthven who laid me by the heels it
was mckenzie

  he faced the detective take me
back to monte carlo hackett he went
on but take me by way of burt city
i want to stop there long enough to
face mckenzie i can tell you things
about mckenzie neither you nor any
one else in these parts ever dreamed
of youll want to hear it hackett
he swung around to get ruthven un-
der his venomous flaming eyes youll
get to burt city ahead of us go to
mckenzie and tell him im on his trail
thats all warn him to pull out-to
drop everything and pull out-before
i get there

  you cant hurt arlo mckenzie
said jenkins

  well see answered morrison
come on-get me away from here i
want to get into some dry clothes

  he moved away drawing jenkins
along with him the detective would
also have left the place had ruthven
not pointed to the bushes

  theres a satchel in there re-
marked ruthven morrison threw it
off the speeder as we neared the bridge
when he got out of the river he came
this way found the satchel and took
that gun out of it maybe theres
something else in the grip that youll
find important

  another one for you ruthven
grunted morrison

  hackett went to the brush picked up
the satchel found it was unlocked and
looked into it then he gave a shout
of delight

  its the famous kit he exclaimed
the patent burglar tools of course
morrison threw them off the speeder
when there was a possibility of his be-
ing captured  could you blame him
finding this kit makes our mornings
work complete not until now have
these things ever been found in the
weasels possession it means a lot

ruthven in the past morrison has
been mighty cl ever in dodging respon-
sibility for this criminal outfit but here
he is caugtyt zvith the goods now lets
get the train back were delaying
these men here

chapter xii

a visit of friendship

vne inconvenience about traveling
 light as ruthven had traveled
from burt city to dry wash wras this
that he had to go to bed at the hotel
while his wearing apparel was being
dried and put into shape ever since
hurrying to the burt city railroad sta-
tion with summerfield  the telephone
request of harrington ruthven had
been entirely the creature of chance

  again and again he had changed his
plans as one fresh development after
another presented itself now he had
made up his mind to defer calling at
bartons upper ranch and to return by
first train to burt city he was urged
to this by weasel morrisons dark
threats against mckenzie to guard
against any possibility of trouble ruth-
ven thought it better to acquaint the
junior partner with what had hap-
pened

  im blest if i know what the w easel
has at the back of his head said the
detective dropping into ruthvens room
while he was waiting for his clothes
he is crazy mad at this man mcken-
zie and liell do him dirt if he can
maybe morrisons hatching up some-
thing to put over on an innocent man
we cant tell about that im going
to take him to monte carlo for we
have him cinched for that job and on
the way i guess well stop off at burt
city there may be something im-
portant for me to know in this mcken-
zie matter its just as well to probe
it anyhow

  it morrison is hatching up any-
thing declared ruthven it is all a


top-notch magazine

tissue of lies why mckenzie is a
member of the legislature and a man of
high social standing respected by all
who know him morrison is of the
underworld and not in mckenzies
class at all i dont see why you should
stop off with morrison and call on
mckenzie just the looks of the thing
ought to keep you from making such
a move

  morrison says mckenzies daughter
met him on the train between williams-
burg and burt city do you know
anything about that 

  the conductor of seventeen lea-
son told me something about it an-
swered ruthven reluctantly

  that looks as though there might be
something between morrison and mc-
kenzie doesnt it im going to see
what sort of a game morrison is trying
to play anyhow well take the after-
noon train to-morrow that will suit
me best

  and im taking the first train in the
morning

  youll see mckenzie

  certainly his daughter is a fine
girl and a friend of some very good
friends of mine i wish youd recon-
sider hackett and not get off at burt
city with this rascally prisoner of
yours

  thats all right ruthven said the
detective its a good thing to let
weasel morrison say to mckenzies
face whatever hes got to say about
him lies can be nailed in that way
quicker than in any other if mcken-
zie sent that anonymous letter to jen-
kins tipping off the weasels game
then he must have had some secret
source of information im going to
find out what it is

  hacketts determination to get off the
eastbound train at burt city was in-
flexible and ruthven yielded the point
after all he would get to mckenzie
several hours before the detective and
morrison could reach him and he could

at least prepare the man for what was
to come

  in the afternoon ruthven bought a
new hat at grandys and in the gray
dawn of the following morning he went
down to the railroad station boarded
the train and started back toward burt
city the train was no  and was
due at burt city at eight-thirty it
was the same train lois had taken when
she went to williamsburg and rode
back on seventeen with weasel mor-
rison

  when he disembarked at his destina-
tion ruthven dropped into a restaurant
for a late breakfast avoiding the ex-
press office and a discussion with sum-
merfield that might consume too much
time he proceeded straight to the em-
porium the senior partner greeted
him with a wide and quizzical smile

  you didnt stay with our little party
tother day eh mr ruthven he said

  no was the reply id like to see
mr mckenzie

  hes stayin home to-day--hasnt
been feelin real prime for some sort
of a  while a little rest is what he
needs and im goin to see that he gets
it how big was that package of bar-
tons when you seen it last long
chuckled still growin 

  it was delivered-tom barton got
his boots and with this ruthven has-
tily departed and made for mckenzies
house

  lois answered his rap at the front
door her eyes were red as though
she had been weeping but she made a
brave attempt to appear like herself

  will you step in mr ruthven she
invited

  he entered the hall left his hat there
and was ushered into a pleasant sitting-
room and given a comfortable chair
the silence was broken by the monot-
onous ticking of a clock and the occa-
sional piping of a canary a big gray
cat arose from a cushion surveyed the
visitor with leisurely interest and then
the fluctuating package



lay down again the surroundings
were all very neat and homelike and
now that ruthven had come to the point
of his errand he was conscious of a
growing constraint

  i wanted to see your father miss
mckenzie said he

  she seemed to flinch although her
eyes regarded him steadily is it very
important she returned father is
not well and is lying down i hate to
disturb him if it is not necessary

  it may be important or it may not
you can be the best judge of that by
telling me if you know a man named
weasel morrison and whether your
fatlier sent an anonymous letter to a
deputy sheriff in dry wash warn-
ing- miss mckenzie forgive me

if i have startled you

  the girl had jumped forward in her
chair so shocked by his words that she
gasped and pressed a hand to her throat
a chill sped through ruthvens nerves
lois actions convinced him that she
knew the scoundrelly morrison or
knew of him but his sympathies were
aroused and he started to his feet anx-
ious and a bit dismayed with a flut-
tering hand the girl waved him back
to his scat

  why do you ask such questions
mr ruthven she queried in a voice
scarcely more than a whisper

  because he answered sympatheti-
cally it may be that i can do your fa-
ther a service i want to be your friend
and his if you will let me what i am
trying to do this morning-i feel sure
is what miss arnold would want me to
do if she were here to speak my mo-
tives are disinterested entirely so apart
from the one desire to render your fa-
ther a service

  there was a stir in a doorway lead-
ing to another room ruthven looked
around to see mckenzie clad in a dress-
ing gojvn and slippers and his gaunt
face like death itself standing there

his burning eyes were fixed upon the
caller

  father go back begged the girl
you are not fit to be on your feet
she turned appealingly to ruthven
you see she added

  her father however pushed reso-
lutely into the room and came slowly
toward a chair mr ruthven lois
said he in a tone which he strove hard
to command is a friend i can read
that in his face and i can see it in his
actions let me talk with him dear
i am no weakling-he smiled faintly
-and i guess i know how to face
trouble

  he turned to ruthven i know
weasel morrison he went on and
my daughter knows of him only
through me as for the rest i am
willing to acknowledge to you that i
sent an anonymous letter of warning
to the deputy sheriff in dry wash you
have something to say about morrison
mr ruthven what is it

  he has been captured

  a wfld exclamation broke from the
girls lips mckenzie dropped into the
chair as though felled by a blow a
moment later the girl was perched on
the arm of the chair one arm around
his neck and one hand stroking his gray-
ing hair

  never mind daddy she murmured
right is right and youll not be made
to suffer dont let this bother you any
more we both hoped that morrison
would be captured and we both did
what we could to have it happen if
necessary we can face the world to-
gether-and leave burt city if we have
to

  with an effort mckenzie secured
control of himself taking the girls
head in his hands he drew it toward
his and kissed her forehead

  what do i care for myself lois
he answered you are the one i
have built up an honored name as the
best heritage i could leave you and


top-notch magazine

now to have a scoundrel like weasel
morrison undo it all is hard-hard
but as you say right is right and we
may come out of this better than we
imagine or hope for i feel that the
crisis is at hand im glad for years
i have felt that it was coming and
there is a satisfaction in being rid of un-
certainties and knowing just where i
stand i am not a coward lois dear
and i know that you are not take
your seat and be calm it is necessary
for me to talk to mr ruthven

  the girl went back to her chair obe-
diently her face was white but reso-
lute ruthven felt out of place some
jealously guarded family secret had
been touched upon a secret that meant
much to father and daughter and he
was sorry to have been the one to bring
it partly into the light

  weasel morrison was captured in
dry wash  mckenzie asked calmly

  yes ruthven answered a detec-
tive named hackett has been trailing
morrison for weeks he followed him
to dry wash and called on jenkins
after the anonymous letter had been re-
ceived i had something to do with the
capture that followed

  had morrison committed any rob-
bery in dry wash the words came
tensely and both mckenzie -and the girl
hung breathlessly upon ruthvens an-
swer

  no he was captured before he had
committed any robbery there

thank heaven for that mur-
mured the man and lois sank back in
her chair in visible relief were the
burglar tools found mckenzie asked
yes the detective has them

  i wish-i am going to give you my
confidence mr ruthven and i hope
you will be as frank with me-i wish
you would tell us why you did not
come back with durfee harrington
and the others from bluffton you
went on with seventeen that carried

the package for barton had you a
particular reason 

  i saw morrisons face at a car win-
dow i knew the man and decided to
follow him

  knew him queried mckenzie in-
credulously

  ruthven told how he had encountered
the weasel in the catskills he went
into the robbery there at some length
but carefully guarded the name of his
former classmate howard millyar mc-
kenzie and lois read into this account
something that struck a responsive
c-hord in their own bosoms ruthven
could see that by the swift significant
glances they exchanged

  if you could do so much to protect
a friend who was almost guilty said
mckenzie i am sure you will befriend
me innocent as i am and entirely a vic-
tim of circumstances for you mr
ruthven i am going to tear in pieces
the veil of mystery surrounding that ex-
press package it goes deep but all
will come out and i want you to have
the right of it-for lois sake even
more than for my own he turned to
his daughter please get that letter
and the telegram lois he requested

  the girl arose and went into another
room ruthven fidgeted in his chair
he was uneasy and yet he was deeply
interested and curious in what wtay
was mckenzie concerned with the mys-
tery of that barton shipment and
how was weasel morrison involved
he was asking himself these questions
when lois returned with two sheets of
paper one white and the other yellow
with a steady hand mckenzie took
them from her

chapter xiii

the trail of the weasel

i suppose weasel morrison had
something to say about me mr
ruthven  said mckenzie

  he told me to tell you he was on
the fluctuating package



your trail answered ruthven and he
made threats as to what he would do
i wanted to warn you so you could
take measures to protect yourself the
officers will take morrison to monte
carlo to-day they will stop off here
with the prisoner hoping the crook will
make some important confession

  lois grew rigid in her chair her
father stared at ruthven keenly for a
moment then tossed his hands in help-
less resignation what time will they
get here  he asked

  late this afternoon

  at that time then my fortunes go
to smash  but i shall not be the first
man to sacrifice for a principle every-
thing that makes life worth while the
hardest thing for me to bear is the un-
happiness all this must bring to lois
he turned tenderly to his daughter
dont you think he asked that you
had better leave us while i talk frankly
with mr ruthven in so far as i
may i am going to discount the revela-
tions morrison intends to make what
i do will not help much and it will
not be pleasant for you to stay and hear
all the dreary story gone over again
lois

  i shall stay father returned the
girl firmly

  mckenzie made no further objection
mr ruthven said he folding and un-
folding the two papers in his hands
quite a number of years ago a man
whom we will call briggs lived in a
large city in the east he was a ma-
chinist and accounted a good one he
was married and had one child a daugh-
ter hard luck came to briggs but
through no fault of his own indus-
trial depression swept the country and
he was thrown out of employment he
was dead broke and there was no work
to be had pawning what little prop-
erty he had to keep his wife and daugh-
ter from starvation he made his way
to chicago in the hope of finding better
opportunities in the middle west in

this he was disappointed and his luck
went from bad to worse then one
night in the fifteen-cent lodging house
where he made his headquarters he met
weasel morrison

  mckenzie paused his eyes fixed re-
flectively on space presently he roused
himself with a start and continued
morrison had come to the lodging
house looking for a pal whom he wanted
to help in pulling off a job some-
thing about briggs attracted him and
he tried to get briggs to lend a hand
in the criminal work promising big re-
turns briggs indignantly refused and
threatened to call the police morrison
left him then and went away with a
snaky smile-a smile that was confident
and full of cunning two days later
briggs got a letter from his wife beg-
-ging for money and saying that she and
the girl were close to starvation

  mckenzie paused for a moment and
then resumed his story that night
morrison came again and renewed his
offers briggs resisted them as he had
done before then another letter ar-
rived from the east from briggs
daughter this time saying that her
mother was very ill and that there was
nothing with which to pay the doctor
or to buy food morrison presented
himself once more for he seemed to
have a devilish insight into briggs af-
fairs and was timely in his suggestions
of crime briggs was near to yield-
ing but a sudden horror rose up in him
and he spurned morrison and his fiend-
ish suggestions and fled from him and
from temptation next day in a crowd
on state street a mans pocket was
picked

  again mckenzie paused strmng to
keep calm then he continued as
fate would have it briggs in his tat-
tered clothes was in that crowd and
close to the man who had been robbed
the first thing he knew he was arrested
and-most damning evidence of all-
the stolen pocketbook was found in his
	top-notch

possession he was arraigned his char-
acter was impeached by plain-clothes
men who had seen him with weasel
morrison and briggs would not give
his real name because he wanted to save
his wife and child from disgrace he
was sent to the penitentiary for five
years-under the name of luther
briggs that innocent man mr ruth-
ven was arlo mckenzie

  it was a simple recital told in a voice
broken with emotion

 ruthven was astounded you-
were sent to prison he exclaimed
and for a crime you did not commit
that is the truth mr ruthven
declared mckcnzie earnestly solemnly
i was the victim of a fiendish plot
my wife died while i was in the peni-
tentiary and a brother-who believed
me guilty and chose to abandon me-
gave a home to lois provided for her
as for his own child and even sent her
to vassar college when i came out
of prison i was bitter against the world
it would have been easy for me then
to take the downward path but lois
-his voice was almost reverent--be-
came my mainstay i came to burt city
assumed my right name and went to
work at my trade later lois came on
and joined me fortune has been kind

i have prospered in business and been
honored politically and the name of
arlo mckenzie is one with integrity
and honor but after this evening i
shall be branded as an -ex-convict and
black disgrace will cover me and mine
his strong hands clenched spasmodi-
cally on the chair arm although a fire
of defiance burned in his eyes

  this will not be breathed lois
quiveringly you will not be made
to suifer for a wrong you never com-
mitted  father you have borne enough
--you will not be asked to bear more
i shall face what i must and hope
for the best

  and is that all morrison has against
you asked ruthven just because

magazine

                               

you refused to help him in his criminal
work has he-

  just a moment please mckenzie
interrupted a little more than a wreek
ago i received a box of oranges from
some unknown shipper inside the box
was a package and a letter the pack-
age contained tools this is the letter
i want you to read it he passed the
white sheet to ruthven and the latter
read

  youve turned straight i hear and so has
wily nate the flimflammer now i can use
you and if you breathe a whisper against me
i can pull down your honors and emolu-
ments like a house of cards abotjt your ears
i want to send the inclosed tools to dry
wash and i dare not keep them in my pos-
session as an officer is after me to be
caught with them will spell disaster and i
guess you wont care to have them around
either nate wylie is freighter for thomas
barton the cattle baron at dry wash he
travels between the ranch and town wylie
is no friend of mine and would do nothing
for me but you have done him a good turn
and he would do anything for you send
these tools on to him a week from tuesday
or wednesday by express and tell him to
keep them under cover until they are called
for warn him that if he doesnt do this i
will smoke him out and you too i dont
care how you arrange the matter just so it
covers the work i will be on seventeen
that passes through burt city at eleven a m
one week from wednesday be at the sta-
tion to get word to me as to what you have
done fail in this and all burt city shall
know you for what you are	v m

  here was a fiendish threat a double-
edged sword suspended by a thread
over mckenzie by the machinations of
morrison it was like the scheming
scoundrel as ruthven knew him

  what did you do asked ruthven
in a low voice

  i wras frantic answered mckenzie
what could i do morrison had found
me out and not only myself but poor
nate wiley as well wiley and i were
prison mates when wiley got out
after doing his time he wrote to me
declaring that he was going straight
and wanted an honest job i got it for
the fluctuating package



him from thomas barton do you
can you understand the position i was
in  asked mckenzie passionately

  it almost killed me he continued
but i had on hand a kit of burglar
tools the mere possession of which
was a crime  counseled with lois
we must get rid of them how all
we could think of that would in any
way spare wiley and myself was by
sending them along to dry wash later
we could warn the law officers and have
them guard against morrisons pros-
pective criminal operations it was a
heavy burden for us to bear but we
took the only course that promised pos-
sible safety for myself and wylie i
was afraid to send the tools to wylie
direct and while i was cudgeling my
wits for some way to get the tools to
dry wash along came those boots for
barton i saw a way out albeit a des-
perate way

  i packed those boots myself in an-
other package identically like the one
containing the boots i put the burglar
tools then i took the boots to the of-
fice prepaid the charges and took a
receipt i asked the driver reeves
what the method was for handling out-
going packages he showed me the
whole of it and i left him having taken
a blank waybill and a blank prepaid
slip and both were stamped by me in
the express office like the ones on the
original package in filling in the way-
bill i imitated reeves writing also i
stuck the slips to the package of tools
identically as reeves had pasted them
on the original package the idea was
to substitute the package of tools for
the package containing the boots - the
original package was left with reeves
after he had come from the westbound
train and i knew the package would not
be sent out until the following day
that would give me time for the substi-
tution ample time and only adroitness
would be needed to put one package in
place of the other

  but what was the idea queried
ruthven a bit puzzled

  the idea was to let morrison carry
the package containing the boots meet
wiley on his way from dry wash to
the ranch and exchange one package
for the other if morrison were caught
by the detective with a parcel containing
a pair of boots it would be infinitely
better for him than being caught with
the burglar kit as for wiley since the
package was addressed to barton-
whose integrity could not be questioned
-if he was taken with the package of
tools he had a chance to escape suspi-
cion i wrote wiley telling him in a
covert way what was expected of him
no one could read that letter and get
anything against wiley morrison or
me i am sure

  ruthvens mind was now plunged
into the mysteries of weight in the mat-
ter of the barton package and the
adroitness of the substitutions tem-
porarily he lost sight of the bearing of
all this on the fortunes of mckenzie
and drove straight at the mystery

  about half past three tuesday after-
noon said ruthven summerfield
weighed the barton package at eleven
according to reeves it had weighed six
pounds at three-thirty according to
summerfield it weighed eight pounds
how were the packages exchanged 

  i did that spoke up lois wearily
at three oclock i called at the ex-
press office and walked behind the
counter joe did not see me for a few
minutes as he was busy at his desk i
had a satchel which i was taking to fa-
ther at the store inside the satchel was
the package of-of burglar tools i took
out the eight-pound package and left it
in place of the six-pound package
which i put in the satchel and-and

then i-

  she dropped her face suddenly in her
hands stifling a sob her father gazed
at her with sadness not unmixed with
pride


top-notch magazine

  my girl did that for me he ex-
plained softly you can understand
her feelings i think jvhen duty to her
father ran so contrary to her own char-
acter and--and ideas of loyalty to sum-
merfield but we were planning only
temporary deception after the tools
were out of our hands and in morri-
sons again we had already made our
preparations to turn on the scheming
crook lois he admonished if you
would not break my heart be brave
she flung up her head tears sparkling
on her cheeks i will father she an-
swered go on

  in my haste to get rid of the bur-
glar kit proceeded mckenzie i had
left out a jimmy a special contrivance
of morrisons it was necessary to get
it into the counterfeit package how
was i to do that i knew the location
of the express storeroom and i also
knew that outgoing packages were
usually put there when kept overnight
about four in the afternoon with the
original package under my coat i
skulked down the alley and came up to
the rear of the express office i could
look through the window and see the
package containing the kit of tools-it
lay on a shelf within easy reach the
window was open it was barred with
cross rods but i slipped one package
through between the bars and removed
the other in the same way

  that commented ruthven excit-
edly left the six-pound package in the
storeroom and you had the eight-pound
package once more in your possession
that is how the package was at the
original weight when reeves returned
and at smnmerfields instigation placed
it on the scales but that night he
added i called at the office to meet
miss mckenzie and when the package
was weighed by all three of us it
weighed nine pounds

  the jimmy i had added accounts for
the further increase in weight

  how was that substitution made

  after i had placed in the package
the instrument i had left out in my
hurry i went back to the rear of the
express office i was alarmed and dis-
appointed when i saw that the original
package was not in the storeroom and
it was impossible to make the substitu-
tion there and then i was at mywits
end-but again lois helped me out

  i remember murmured ruthven
summerfield had left the package out
in the front office to investigate it fur-
ther after he had finished his evenings
work

  mr summerfield left me alone in
the office when he went for ice cream
explained lois her eyes lowered and
i handed the six-pound package out to
father who was on the sidewalk in
front and took from him the nine-
pound parcel placing it just where joe
had left the other

  oh it was hard hard she said
chokingly i was there with you and
joe when the package was weighed and
found to have increased to nine pounds
and i saw you place the penciled cross
on it for purposes of identification
you both trusted me and-and i was
not worthy of that trust but she fin-
ished resolutely it was all for father-
and his cause was a righteous one i
had to play the part i did

  lois told me later of the identifica-
tion mark proceeded mckenzie and
i placed it on the original package i
was alarmed of course to learn that
the barton shipment was causing so
much discussion in the office if i
could i would have given up the whole
thing then and there and have substi-
tuted the original six-pound parcel for
the last time and thrown the burglars
kit into a cistern or got rid of it in
some other way but i dared not i
had gone too far you understand and
there was a lingering hope that i might
save wylie and myself from the venge-
ance of morrison

  it was necessary to go on he said
the fluctuating package



despairingly absolutely necessary
truly we wreave a tangled web when
we start to deceive and i was not yet
through with my tinkering with the
carton shipment about ten oclock i
received a telegram-this and he
handed the yellow slip to ruthven the
latter read

  inclose full canister with goods m

  what does that mean  he asked

  for canister read revolver  said
mckenzie the term is used occa-
sionally by crooks in this instance of
course morrison used it to disguise
the other word he was sending the
message to a storekeeper hence to
others not informed it must have
seemed innocent enough this request
made it necessary for me to make an-
other substitution as i intended turn-
ing on morrison later by following all
his instructions to the letter i hoped to
escape some of the blame he would
throw on me if matters went wrong for
him also i saw a chance to diminish
his powers for evil

  the revolver i secured by a night
visit to the store i filled the canister
but with blank cartridges by way of
the alley i went to the rear of the ex-
press office at dead of night slipped
back the old-fashioned sash lock that
secured the window and took out the
overweight package and placed the six-
pound parcel in its place i went home
to unwrap the kit of tools and pack the
revolver with them  and when i wanted
to return and exchange the two pack-
ages a night watchman was roaming
through the alley and i was prevented
i gave up the attempt for the night

  next morning lois took the early
train for williamsburg and rode back
from there on seventeen she insisted
on going and her plan was to meet
morrison and explain the situation so
that he would know just what had been
going on and what was expected of
him i described morrison to her so

that she would recognize him and she
had little difficulty in doing so i was
to be at the train ostensibly to meet
lois and i was to have a satchel con-
taining the original package which i
was to give to morrison

  i wras at the station when reeves
drove up and unloaded the express mat-
ter for seventeen i had a chance-a
desperate one-to make the substitu-
tion and place the package with the
revolver on the station platform and get
the other one into the satchel i was all
unstrung and it is a wonder i was not
detected lois when she got off the
train threw herself into my arms i
have explained everything to him fa-
ther she whispered now give him the
satchel and the barton package and let
us be thankful we are at last rid of
those terrible burglars tools my re-
lief in getting rid of that kit was as
great as was lois all that remained
after that was to send the letter to
jenkins the deputy sheriff at dry
wrash i put it into the mail car on
seventeen

  while i was at the station waiting
for the train to come reeves had
weighed the package and found that it
now tipped the scales at ten pounds i
heard him excitedly telling summerfield
about it over the phone from the sta-
tion i went directly home with lois
for i was badly shaken and needed her
comfort and counsel all we could do
after that was to wait yes and worry
now you come and tell me that mor-
rison has been captured and that he is
to be here this afternoon and lay bare
my prison record

  mckenzie got up that means he
went on huskily that all my years of
work here in this new country have
been thrown away my friends and
neighbors will know i am an ex-con-
vict and that lois is the daughter of
a man who has done time he
swayed and his gaunt face was con-
vulsed writh sorrow and pain


top-notch magazine

  to-night he whispered i shall be
ruined and disgraced-ruined and dis-
graced  the petty conjuring i did with 
that express package was wasted ef-
fort it would have been better had i
taken the burglars kit to the burt city
sheriff told him all just as i have told
it now to you mr ruthven and thus
had the story come from my own lips
now morrison will tell it and-and

who knows whether-

  his voice  failed lois ran to his
side put an arm about him and gently
but firmly led him back toward the
other room ruthven had also risen to
his feet his brain bewildered by all he
had heard but deep in his heart he
was conscious of profound sympathy
for arlo mckenzie and his daughter

  lois emerged alone from the rear
room and went straight to ruthven
you believe my father she asked

  absolutely- answered and i
am sorry for him-and for you
when-when you write gwen
please make it easy for us she begged

  i shall not write gwen anything
about it said he and i shall not speak
to any one about it until morrison has
had his way then when i do talk
it will be as a friend of arlo mckenzie
and as a believer in him

  she caught bth his hands

  oh she murmured chokingly i
felt that the man who had befriended
howard millyar could not turn from
father and me will you come this
afternoon  will you please be with us
when weasel morrison faces father

i want you to know all that takes place
mr ruthven

  i will come he said and he went
away

chapter xiv

the clouds bright lining

in order to marshal the facts regard-
ing those two barton packages so
that the various substitutions might be
clear to him directly after dinner at

the hotel ruthven went to his room
with pencil and paper he jotted down
the following

  tuesda about eleven oclock mckenzie
learns how express matter is handled and
while sending package of boots to barton
takes from the office a prepaid yellow slip
and blank waybill also without the knowl-
edge of reeves he uses the rubber stamps
on the waybills

  tuesday three oclock lois enters express

back toward her is oblivious of her pres-
ence taking out the parcel with the bur-
glars tools she puts into the satchel the six-
pound package

  tuesday about three-thirty summerfield
looks over the packages by the stove weighs
barton package and finds it weighs eight
pounds he places it in the storeroom laying
it on shelf near open barred window mc-
kenzie finding an improved jimmy has been
left out in hurry and excitement of getting
substitute package ready creeps up through
alley back of express office and substitutes
original six-pound package for counterfeit
eight-pound parcel

  tuesday five p m reeves the driver
comes into express office package is
weighed by him and summerfield and tips
the scale at six pounds

  tuesday about six p m mckenzie comes

with knowledge of lois ruthven puts private
pencil mark on package

  tuesday evening after nine weasel mor-
risons telegram about the canister is re-
ceived by mckenzie that night mckenzie
opens window in rear of storeroom and re-
moves package to add still another article to
its contents when he comes to put back the
counterfeit package and take original he is
interfered with by night watchman and gives
up the attempt for the night lois has told
the fluctuating package



him of ruthvens private mark and mcken-
zie duplicates it on the other package

  wednesday nine-thirty a m package
weighed again six pounds

  wednesday ten-thirty a m reeves drives
to station with outgoing freight for seven-
teen mckenzie there with a satchel osten-
sibly to meet lois lois had gone east at

at williamsburg and ride back with weasel
morrison so as to explain the situation to
him while reeves is unloading wagon mc-
kenzie exchanges counterfeit parcel with
added revolver putting package containing
boots into satchel hands this satchel to
morrison when train halts and lois gets off
mails his letter on the train-the one for
jenkins the deputy sheriff at dry wash

  wednesday ten-fifty a m reeves tele-
phones from station that package weighs ten
pounds

  note mighty good thing for me that the
canister was loaded with blanks

  that ruthven remarked after he
had scribbled out this summary gets
this series of substitutions in black and
white so far as mckenzie and lois are
concerned now what happened after
that lets see

  picking up the pencil he reflected
for a few moments and went on with
his writing

  on seventeen train halts at bluffton by
order of division superintendent morrison
learns an extra is coming after seventeen
with durfee and harrington and others gets
worried about package in express car goes
forward mingling with other passengers who
have got off the train during the wait while
messenger is busy exchanges packages
through open door of car leaving six-pound
parccl in place of the one weighing ten
pounds when extra arrives package in ex-
press car is found to weigh six pounds and
to contain tan bluchers for barton morri-
son sees and recognizes ruthven from car
window watches while ruthven jumps on
the train jcnows he is after him and that
he must get rid of burglar tools goes for-
ward enters express car and bowls over
messenger from behind exchanges burglar
tools for six-pound package and jumps off
train just before it reaches okaday

  leaning back in his chair ruthven
studied this last effort it was one of
analysis pure and simple in the light
of what he had learned from mckenzie

he believed he had hit off the course of



events pretty accurately

 now he asked himself what
about the attempted holdup on the way
to the ranch ah i have it again
he seized the pencil and wrote

  thursday forenoon nate wylie sick with
mountain fever and unable to make the trip
to dry wash william martin acts as substi-
tute freighter morrisons plans all up in the
air only thing he can do is to pull off a
holdup in making exchange of package with
boots for package with burglars tools his
pal helps him horses run away package
spilled out with vest of freight in the moun-
tain wagon morrison picks up package with
tools and puts down package with boots-
breaking wrapper and box to make it appear
as though package had received rough treat-
ment in spill from wagon

  by jove ive got it exclaimed
ruthven in a glow over his work i
have followed those two packages in
all their changes and adventures from
the time the boots were handed over
the counter of the express office in burt
city how blamed simple it all is
when one puts it down in black and
white and yet what a brain twister
when one hasnt got the key to the mys-
tery i 

  he broke off his reflections as the
tragic side of the matter forced itself
on his attention his heart sank as he
thought of mckenzie and lois when
weasel morrison talked against mc-
kenzie the honorable arlo mckenzie
member of the legislature the junior
partner in the firm of long  mcken-
zie what would happen  ruthven
who had a big heart and was kindly
and considerate to all felt a clammy
hand gripping his brain how would
summerfield behave toward lois when
the dread truth came out 

  i think joe is a real man ruth-
ven reflected and im sure that hell
act like a man he wont give up the
girl no matter what weasel morrison
says what a scoundrel morrison is
anyhow mckenzie is caught in a web
similar to the one that entangled mill-


top-notch magazine

yar there was a silver lining to mill-
yars cloud but mckenzies troubles so
far as i can see have no bright side
toward six oclock ruthven made
his way back to the mckenzie home
mckenzie himself met him at the door
he was dressed with care freshly
shaved and wearing his best clothes
there was grim determination in his
gaunt face just from the look of him
ruthven knew that he had steeled him-
self to see that crisis through to a
finish

  lois was in the sitting room quietly
waiting this awful hour finds us
ready mr ruthven she said with a
wan smile then she whispered as her
father stepped out of the room for a
moment watch dad will you  he
seems so calm and self-possessed that
i am afraid some desperate purpose is
in his mind he-he might attack
morrison

  ruthven nodded reassuringly ill
watch he added dont worry
they heard the train roll up to the
station from the west it was several
minutes late mckenzie placed him-
self at a window from which he could
see the railroad station and watched the
arriving passengers ruthven got up
and stepped to his side out of the
crowd that moved around the station
one man could be seen making in the
direction of al reeves who was haul-
ing a truckload of incoming freight
the two talked together for a moment
then reeves turned and pointed in the
direction of mckenzies house

  thats hackett the detective said
ruthven

  the ticking of the clock sounded like
a knell the fitful piping of the ca-
nary only served to accentuate the
dreariness of the wait

hes coming this way alone re-
marked mckenzie colorlessly is
some one else bringing morrison
maybe morrison isnt going to come
at all returned ruthven a sudden

hope thrilling in his voice i told
hackett i didnt see the use of bother-
ing you with any of morrisons
schemes he insisted that it was neces-
sary but maybe he has changed his
mind

  i believe air ruthven said mc-
kenzie that you have been a much
better friend of mine all along than i
had any reason to think but the blowt
is going to fall and we may as well
wait patiently for it

  he sat down and cast a glance full
of vague anxiety toward lois she
smiled back at him sympathetically
and cheeringly presently there was a
knock at the door and lois went to
answer it

  mr mckenzies house came the
question in hacketts voice from the
front door

  yes

  is mr mckenzie here or will i
have to go to the store to see him
he is here please come in

  the detective was ushered into the
room hello ruthven  he called
glad to see you here this is mr
mckenzie 

ruthven introduced the two men
youve called to see me about
-about something weasel morrison
said queried mckenzie bracing him-
self

  thats it exactly

  i thought morrison wtas to be with
you

  so did i jenkins and i w-ere bring-
ing him and his pal along and i in-
tended to stop off at burt city with
morrison but-well that is impossible
now you see i had morrison hand-
cuffed to my right wrist and in some
way he managed to break the cuff
dashed down the aisle of the car and
jumped into the right of way

  here was startling information all
those in the room sat up very straight
as they listened

  and he escaped asked ruthven
the fluctuating package



  no said the detective slowly he
didnt escape the train was going
rapidly-we were midway between sta-
tions-and there was a deep rocky cut
beside the track morrison went into
that cut like a bag of meal and rolled
over and over when the train stopped
and backed up we carried him aboard
and brought him to the railroad com-
panys hospital at okaday  jenkins got
off with him there taking the other
prisoner along i came on here

  was-was morrison badly hurt
asked mckenzie

  there was a doctor on the train and
he examined morrison and didnt think
he had a chance morrison revived so
that he could talk and was made to
realize his situation he dictated a
statement which he wanted brought to
mr mckenzie i havent the slightest
idea what it means to you mckenzie
but here it is morrison could not use
his hand to write but he placed his fin-
ger on a pencil and some one else wrote
his name for him fi is statement was
witnessed by myself jenkins the doc-
tor and a nurse

  hackett passed a folded paper to mc-
kenzie the latter unfolded it and in
a shaking voice read aloud

  some years ago in chicago one luther
briggs was arrested as a pickpocket and sent
to the penitentiary for five years he served
his time left prison and made good in the

west desiring to undo a wrong and being
told that i am near the end of my mortal
career i wish to state that i was guilty of
the crime for which luther briggs was con-
victed the leather was lifted by me and
transferred to the pocket of briggs i
thought briggs would make an excellent side
partner and had approached him on the mat-
ter but he would not listen to me inasmuch
as this supposed offense was his first i
thought he would escape with a light sen-
tence and that i could handle him when he
came out of prison but the judge gave hini
the limit and my plan went wrong this is
the truth

signed	weasel morrison

  a dead silence reigned in the room
when mckenzie finished reading with
a long deep sigh he fell back in his
chair and the paper dropped from his
fingers

  father burst joyously from lois
and she ran to put her arms about him

  at last after all these years mur-
mured mckenzie brokenly

  ruthven took the detective by the
arm and drew him from the room and
from the house were only in the
way there now he cried happily say
id like to give three good cheers and
a tiger  oh this is fine and all the
finer because it was unexpected

  hanged if i know what ive done
thats so all-fired fine but sometimes its
just as well for a detective not to know
too much when can i get a train back
to okaday

the call of the open

by dorothea mackeliar

i am sick of the noise in the long gray street where the crowd floods up and
    down

    and i long for the touch of untainted winds in the little-trodden lands

i am tired of the frigid unchanging rules and the thousand eyes of town

    i would go to a place where the men are men and hold their lives in their
        hands

i would go to the life which is quite alive the world that is all around

    i must break myself free of this mincing dance where one may not step
        aside

out of fear of the million fools that yelp from their kennels custom bound-

    to the naked noon and the throbbing night and the life where the world is
        wide

 a
oon after the town called
break o day organized its
commercial club a committee
was appointed to visit tom
blakely publisher of the
weekly sunrise and explain what the
club expected of him in the great up-
lift movement just inaugurated tom
was seated at a long table in his dinky
office reading exchanges and charging
the atmosphere with tobacco smoke
from a corncob pipe he was a big
good-natured chap not long off the
farm but with a wild yearning to be
an editor and print pieces that would
make em sit up at the district
school where tom secured all the book
learnin he had he was editor in chief
of the owl creek news printed on a
hand-me-down typewriter and his suc-
cess with that provincial sheet had put
the editorial bug in his head

  we are looking to you tom said
colonel jim riley lawyer real-estate
man and notary public who was chair-
man of the committee to give us the
publicity we want break o day on
the map

  sure acquiesced the lank editor
as he knocked the ashes out of his
inspirational assistant and tossed it on
the table ill fill the paper up every
week-editorial and local boosts till
you cant rest

  the chairman gave a contemptuous
grunt the sunrise is all right here
at home tom he remarked but we
are after bigger game we want to
interest outside capital the purpose
is to let everybody in these united
states know theres a thriving town in
these parts by the name of break o
day

  the young editor stared how you
going to put em next-telephone em 
he inquired

  youre to get appointed as special
correspondent for a tiptop metropolitan
daily paper said riley and send in
stuff every so often under a break o
day date line see

  oh that ws something new to
editor blakely more it was intensely
fascinating why not  couldnt he
write as well as the next man and
why wouldnt it go in a great big paper
on the wire



as well as at home so long as it was
good reading then came a doubt

   reckon theyll print a lot of stuff
about boosting the town he asked
wont they call it advertising and turn
it down

  we dont care what sort of stuff
you send so long as it has the break o
day date line hitched to it somewhere
responded mr riley its to get the
town known-thats what were after
write anything you want sos you get
the line cast well tend to bringing in
the fish

  within a week tom blakely was the
duly accredited special correspondent
for the daily continental writh author-
ity to cover all the news that there
might be in the region of break o
day then there was a circular of
instructions which the correspondent
faithfully memorized the work was
entirely to his liking aside from help-
ing the town it might help tom
blakely who was born with a craze for
writing

  tom didnt proclaim from the house-
tops that he was now connected author-
itatively with the daily press but he
felt a burning desire to make that an-
nouncement ilis brief experience as
a country editor had taught him that
it was wiser to crow after results than
before he would get up a nice story
about something or other and when
the paper came out with it under a
break o day date line the people would
know without his telling who the
author was by good fortune he had
in mind a local incident worth narrat-
ing the instructions contained a rule
 for this

   stories not strictly news may be sent by
mail and will be paid for at regular space
rates

   the subject was in that classification
refilling and lighting his working part-
ner the young editor turned to his
table and went to work on his story
while some shiny-headed literary ex-

pert might have found enough gram-
matical blowholes everlastingly to con-
demn it he would have had to con-
fess that the incident was good and
the narration interesting the paper
printed it and break o day opened
its eyes colonel riley called around
and tendered a cigar and a clap on the
shoulder

iknew you could do it he said

ii

 tnder the encouragement of his
first story the correspondent went
to work on others it seemed easy to
find subjects and his fingers tingled
with the enthusiasm of heart and brain
the results were eminently satisfactory
to the writer and strong hope followed
the long envelopes marked special
correspondence-rush

  two days later tom with eager
hands picked up the paper that should
have contained his story but it wasnt
there then hope suggested it was be-
ing held for the sunday edition but
the day of rest brought another dis-
appointment later his matter was re-
turned with thanks he made several
more ventures and then the editor
kindly suggested that heavy spring ad-
vertising was responsible for lack of
space for material that was not overly
important

  not overly important

  the phrase rankled in his breast for
a week then he picked up his in-
structions and noted that telegraph
matter was given particular attention

  thats it thought tom they
want live news right off the wire ive
been a chump

  that week the mayors daughter was
married to the hotel man of break o
day it was a bang-up affair there
was an orchestra from the big city
flowers and presents galore the par-
lors of the hotel were decorated with
a sinful disregard of expense there


top-notch magazine

were a dozen bridesmaids and a world
of white-gjoved ushers in the center
of the main hall was a vine arrange-
ment for the ceremony wedding bells
and orange blossoms blazed every-
where there was no doubt that it
was the swellest affair ever pulled off
at break o day in his journalistic
capacity tom witnessed the whole per-
formance it was not far from mid-
night when the correspondent who had
waited conscientiously until every de-
tail of the wedding should unfold be-
fore his own eyes rushed to his office
to begin work on his big story be-
fore he picked up his pencil he reread
the instructions to be sure of his
ground

  should you have a story of high impor-
tance at an hour too late to query send it in
remember under the law of the daily con-
tinental the highest crime is getting scooped 

  it was clear as noonday nothing
could happen at break o day of higher
importance than the nuptials he had
just witnessed the whole town had
been talking about it for a week and
everybody would look for a big spread
in the papers the hired musicians
from the city connected the event with
that town and made it certain the con-
tinental would stand all it could get so
tom bribed the railroad operator with
a package of cigarettes and sailed in
he didnt leave out a thing that either
party to the marriage might have sug-
gested printing at the end he filed
a complete list of the wedding pres-
ents the story made three thousand
words and cost the paper about fifteen
dollars tom went to bed satisfied
theyd have to print that stuff because
the telegraph company would make em
pay for it whether they used it or not
he had taken the precaution to mail
pictures of the bride and groom in ad-
vance

  the local news dealer did a iand-
office business in continentals next day
-for a while purchasers hastily

turned the pages for the big story but
it seemed there was nothing doing

  it aint in exclaimed a disap-
pointed girl who had been one of the
bridesmaids

  and he said thered be a column
with pictures growled another dis-
consolate one

  if id a known he wasnt going
to print it i wouldnt a bothered about
giving him all that information com-
mented the mayor who had purchased
ten copies of the continental sights
unseen

  here it is said some one

  where read it came a score of
voices

  the discoverer did so

  break o day may -charles smith
and lizzie jones were married here to-night
at the palace hotel the bride is a daugh-
ter of timothy jones mayor of the town

  is that all they cried

  yes that was all the papers were
thrown down in disgust tom wasnt
in a very good humor when the mayor
called on him but as the grievance was
common to both of them they did not
fall out the editor promised to print
the whole story in his own paper and
the mayor agreed to take fifty copies
but this didnt end the correspondents
troubles the mail brought from st
louis a manifold copy of his telegram
with a letter informing him that he had
violated instruction no a and that
his account would be charged with the
telegraph toll there was also a copy
of the printed instructions with certain
lines heavily underscored

  from that miserable day tom went
into his shell his first idea had been
to write a scathing reply in which he
would hint at the journalistic incapacity
of the city editors to tell a good story
when they saw it he knew that the
mayor the hotel keeper and the unani-
mous population of break o day would
gladly sign as attesting witnesses next
he thought of resigning and throwing
on the wire



their insulting letter and their instruc-
tions in their teeth but that looked
a bit childish and tom was a man
whether he was much of a correspond-
ent or not anyhow this wasnt the

end of the world and then-

though the mills of god grind slowly
yet they grind exceeding small

  he had meant well and in the eter-
nal order of things there was bound
to be a chance so he laid aside his
instructions and the disturbing letter
and waited he hadnt been fired and
was still the duly accredited correspond-
ent for the continental at break o
day poor consolation but some

iii

time a month later scenc editorial
rooms the daily continental op-
erator takes message hurriedly over to
a thin man at a desk who reads this

  break o day june -ten-year feud in
bull run neighborhood culminates in anni-
hilation of two families serious wounding
of six men four murderers in prison-
sheriff-

  the man at the desk waited to read
no more he wired blakely to get
busy instanter and send everything the
operator at break o day could handle
artists were ordered to clear the decks
for action to illustrate the report
everything was cleaned out of the first
page and the scare-head man was ex-
perimenting with such full-page lines
as two whole families slaughtered
streams flow red in bull run
township reign of terror near
break o day 

  in the course of an hour this terse
message was laid  the anxious tele-
graph editors desk

  how about that letter	t b

  the telegraph editor frowned and
carried it to the old man who looked
thoughtful a moment then said
thats the fellow who sent us a three-
thousand-word wire about the wedding

  up his way i dont believe hes got
sense enough to handle the story he
has now better send mac up there
hes just got ten minutes to catch the
train tell him to scoot

  macconnell was one of the stars
he happened to be in the first tele-
gram from break o day was put in
his hands the boss came out with a
roll of bills and the telegraph editor
helped him on with his overcoat if
that yarn is anything near the situation
said the managing editor give the op-
erator there a twenty-dollar bonus and
make him stay with you dont spare
expenses

  this was merely a little formality as
if the old man had said good-by
pleasant journey

  the reporter knew what to do and
just how to weigh the story the edi-
tors breathed easier macconnell was
a veteran and was at home in a riot
or any sort of trouble it was cal-
culated that he would reach break o
day shortly after noon by two oclock
his stuff ought to be coming in when
that hour arrived without any word
the guiding heads in the office began
to get worried a message was sent
directing macconnell to report his ar-
rival at break o day it brought no
answer at three a telegram came
from blakely wanting to know if the
continental cared about the sanguinary
battle in bull run township

  whatll i say asked the telegraph
editor

  after a moments meditation the old
man suggested a message to the station
operator at break o day asking if mac-
connell had arrived the operator re-
plied that he had arrived and had made
a deposit of twenty dollars to insure
prompt service the telegrapher was
ready for work but macconnell had
not turned up with his copy blakely
however was sitting there in the office
with the story all written out waiting
to hear from the continental


top-notch

magazine

  tell blakely to file his stuff
growled the m e

  what will i tell him about that
letter asked the telegraph editor
he wont let it go till we fix up about
that

  what do you suppose the lunkhead
wants to know

  cant imagine replied the other
maybe he wants you to tell him you
didnt mean it

  well said the big editor impa-
tiently tell him well make it al right
with him if hell release the stuff quick
wonder what the deuce become of mac-
connell

  blakely was notified that all was for-
given and asked to be good and let his
horror story rumble along but the
enemy had other terms

  will you print the jones-smith wed-
ding just as it was sent in and the pic-
tures  blakely wanted to know over
the wire

  the telegraph editor could feel his
hair getting gray around the temples

  good heavens ejaculated the old
man when the latest condition reached
him do you suppose macconnell is
dead

iv

the minutes were sailing away like
mad artists copy readers and
others wrho were to work on the big
story stood idly around the young
women hurriedly donned their hats and
things so as to escape the direful lan-
guage it was too late to send another
man there was no other correspond-
ent within forty miles of break o day
but to print that fool wedding story
long after it had ceased to be news
would make the paper the subject for
jest in all the years to come blakely
must be crazy a man of such erratic
notions couldnt possibly have sense
enough to get a big story right

  the old man had almost decided to
let the whole business go to the dogs

  when he heard a newsboy yelling some-
thing or other about bull run the
evening paper was secured and the two
editors eagerly devoured it there
were tremendous headlines but not
much of a story the real news ex-
tended no further than what was con-
tained in blakelys first message to the
continental but around that had been
built an ingenious structure of sur-
mises with a sigh of relief the editor
dropped it and told the telegraph man
tc come to immediate terms with the
correspondent at break o day

  then the story came red-hot it
covered every detail of the tragedy
arranged in chronological order all told
in a calm dispassionate way and con-
cluding with a history of the feud dis-
trict from ten years back to date

  when the last page had been read
and approved with hardly a change the
telegraph editor walked in on the chief
blakely delivered the goods he said

  confound him wras the ungrateful
rejoinder

  its the best-written story weve
printed in twelve months pursued the
telegraph editor

  what exploded the other

  hes a diamond in the rough well
have to cultivate him was the tele-
graph editors advice

  half an hour later there came an-
other call from break o day to the
intense surprise of the editors it was
from macconnell the lost star
macconnell wired

  gang of riders from bull run here when
i arrived spotted me soon after i left
correspondent at depot said would not let
anything get out about that shooting till they
got the fellows they were after took me
out of town and held me in old cabin till
just a little while ago when i got loose
rushed to telegraph office and learned our
man blakely had sent good story as he
was leaving bull run crowd saw him
learned he serft the message and were
mad as tigers blakely held them of with
gun till they winged him citizens heard
firing and mixed in with shotguns two of
on the wire



gang killed two wounded and captured one
got away blakely now at mayors house
cared for like king he is trump his gun
was empty when he went down mac

  what the reporter did not mention-
for probably he did not realize its im-
portance-was the country editors cryp-
tic utterance when they helped him into
the hack

  say gasped blakely will this put
us on the map

a soft answer

a small boy came home one day in
    a rather disheveled state

  tommy exclaimed his mother
youve been fighting again

  well said tommy in self-defense
the boy next door was fresh

  that was no reason for fighting
you should have remembered that a
soft answer turneth away wrath and
you should have given him a soft an-
swer

  i did said tommy thats what
started the fight i threw a ripe tomato
at him

a wishbone proposal

they were dining in a restaurant
and he ordered as part of the meal
a roast chicken when the waiter
carved it up the young man asked for
the wishbone and after the waiter had
left them they settled down to the busi-
ness of breaking it

  you see the young man explained
showing her the wishbone you take
hold here and i hold the other end
then we must each make a wish and
pull and when it breaks the one who
gets the bigger part of it will have his
or her wish gratified

  the lady said she quite understood
but i dont know what to wish for
she protested shyly

  oh you can think of something he
urged

  i cant think of anything she re-
plied

  well ill wish for you he sug-
gested

  the young lady blushed will you
really she asked

  yes he said firmly i will

  well then she said smiling hap-
pily theres no use fooling about with
the old wishbone if you wish for me
you-you can have me

hard to satisfy

a rich money lender lost his pocket-
book at one of the paris railway
stations just as he was on the point of
starting on most important and press-
ing business it contained about one
thousand pounds in notes and gold

  on his return some six weeks after-
ward he learned that the pocketbook
had been found and was deposited at
the lost-property office

  he went there and the pocketbook
was handed to him with a trembling
hand and his heart beating with joy he
opened it and carefully examined the
contents

  pardon me he said when he had
finished counting theres something
missing

  i believe not replied the official
what is it

  what is it why wheres the in-
terest

easily answered

a tourist was being shown round
the village churchyard in england
by the aged sextom the old man was
telling him all sorts of fairy stories
about the famous people who had been
connected with the church

  ah yes sir he said this is a
famous cemetery here lies oliver
cromwell over there we have the re-
mains of julius caesar and here-he
hesitated his finger pointing to a third
grave-i-i forget who is lying here

  i could tell you who is lying here

sternly

option for the purchase of the dusk group
it is possible that we can arrive at terms
which will be to our mutual satisfaction and
advantage at any rate it will do no harm
to talk things over kindly come in to see
me at your earliest convenience

 the stationery on which this was
typed impressed sumner favorably
glancing at the engraved letterhead
he noted that blands seattle office was
in the henry building an exclusive
as the arrow to the bow



modern structure favored by rich cor-
porations and their representatives as
the missive set forth it would do no
harm to talk over the coal proposition
if further transactions seemed likely
there would be time for him to investi-
gate blands reliability and to safeguard
himself

  when he was shaved and brushed and
generally groomed in the best his lim-
ited wardrobe afforded the young man
strode off to the electric-car line that
led citywrard with the air of one who
sets out to conquer the car was com-
paratively empty and he had a cross
seat to himself so he again studied
the missive on which his new hope was
founded

  as they were leaving the university
station he realized that some one had
stopped in the aisle opposite his seat
and he looked up to find charlotte
crawford beaming upon him his plan
of self-effacement at least until she had
passed judgment on the promised tandy
disclosure was untenable for there was
no doubting her desire to sit and chat
with him on the half-hour run into the
heart of seattle arising he offered
her the seat by the window

  so im not the only studious soul
who occasionally answers the call of
the city she said taking the proffered
seat and making room for him beside
her

  im answering a sordid business
call he said with a laugh which she
remembered she had never heard on
the campus but which had attracted her
when they were together in the lifeboat
hope was ascendant and he borrowed
confidence from the missive in his
pocket indefinite as it was between
my flower ranch rowing and the
eighteen hours of college work im
dragging this year he added there
isnt much time left for pleasures met-
ropolitan or rural

  but you enjoy your work with the
flowers she reminded him

  so much that i cant claim any great
credit as a working student he
laughed again this time for the secret
hope that a coal-land option would bring
him out of the work-way class i
wonder if you will permit me to send
you a box of my hothouse roses for the
hop next friday they will be only
buds but appropriate and none of the
women will have finer

  sumner was just a bit amazed at the
temerity of this offer he had felt com-
pelled to make it by his desire to do
some little thing for the one coed
who had ever evidenced the slightest
interest in him and by the thought that
this might be his last opportunity

  it is surprising how rapidly some
people emerge from their chrysalis once
they start she thought beaming upon
him with frank approval i shall be
delighted with the flowers she re-
sponded particularly because you
forced them to bloom ahead of time
do you dance mr sumner

  thanks to his weathered complexion
the flush that mounted to his cheeks at
this very casual question was not ap-
parent her question brought to him
an acute realization of his social limita-
tions and he was ashamed to tell her
that the only steps he knew were those
which the straits natives danced at their
potlaches or give-away feasts

  you forget miss crawford that i
come from the very last frontier he
said we dont dance your sort of
dances in civilizations jumping-off
place

  but this evasion served only to
heighten her interest she chatted to
him of the prevailing craze for new
and weird dance steps of how enthu-
siastically people had taken up the fox
trot and the lame-duck waltz she was
certain that an indian dance from their
own west coast would be a sensation

  will you not teach me the steps
she asked

  this unexpected interest astonished

hiip can you imagine a city orchestra
reproducing the native music he said
dubiously but she expressed the belief
that indian music had been harmonized
for both piano and orchestra and added
a note to her shopping list

  til stop in at a music store to-day
and inquire she said if i can find
the music you may consider yourself
elected to teach me the steps well
give the u something to arise and take
notice of wont we

  after this unintended plunge into so-
cial hot water sumner grew cautious
and forced the burden of the conversa-
tion upon the girl though he doubted
that she noticed his intent she found
a dozen things to talk about and dis-
cussed them all with a rapidity of
thought and fertility of expression that
increased his admiration he was sorry
when the car swept into the regrade dis-
trict and reached the corner nearest the
henry building at fourth avenue and
union street

  as he made his way into the build-
ing his thoughts were not upon the
coal-land option which he had come to
investigate what a wonderful crea-
ture was she lie had just left her
beauty with its delicate coloring her
charm of manner her sprightly con-
versation all claimed his devotion
confound burton tandy anyway he
said to himself why hasnt fate been
willing to keep my secret im certain
i would know where to draw the line
and a year or two of friendship with
charlotte crawford would not harm her
and would help me mightily

  in something of a daze a prey to con-
flicting emotions he was elevated to the
floor which held the office he sought
only the sight of the gilt-lettered in-
scriptions upon the office door brought
him back to grim reality

  there was nothing startling about its
anouncement-r choate bland at-
torney at law-for he had expected
that but at the bottom of the ground

glass was this surprising addendum
office of the r b tandy estate
sumner started back at this unexpected
combination of his hopes and fears upon
the same door glass

  into his mind flashed the shrewd sus-
picion that in this same combination
might be found the reason for burton
tandys unexplained silence it was
evident that attorney bland and the es-
tate which represented his enemys for-
tune were closely connected suppose
the estate was the client of which the
lawyer spoke in his letter if the
tandy interests desired his coal land
the heir to them might well be willing
to take back his animosity until a deal
was assured by the taking of options

  for a moment robert thought of
turning away without entering the office
and ignoring the invitation to a con-
ference second thought however re-
minded him that this would not affect
the personal issue after all what did
it matter to him who bought his coal
so long as he got his price glad that
he had seen the sign of combination
which would serve to put him on guard
he stepped into a plainly furnished of-
fice the front quarter of which was
separated from the rest by a railing

  a man occupied at a filing cabinet
which ran along one wall looked up and
jerked his head toward a bench as
much as to say sit down and wait
until ive found what im searching
for from the bench sumner noticed
an open door through which he could
look into what was evidently blands
private office the floor of which wore
a velvety green rug the heavy furni-
ture was of rosewood the general effect
too ornate

  presently the little man slammed a
tin case back into the rack with nervous
haste and approached the rail well
he queried impatiently what is it
what is it

  i should like to see mr bland

  wheres that boy whos run off
as the arrow to the bow



with that flighty stenographer theyre
never around when one wants them
the nervous individual directed these
remarks to the empty chairs within the
rail then he returned to his visitor
youd like to see bland eh well
youre looking at him what is it

  i am robert sumner said the ju-
nior and there he stopped on the rea-
sonable expectation that further ex-
planation would be superfluous

  it seemed to him that the lawyer
started there was no doubting the
sharp look that he sent over the rail-
ing the narrowing of thinly lashed lids
or the compression of the corners of
his mouth with a letter requesting an
interview in his pocket sumner natu-
rally wondered at these indications of
surprise

  for once blands facial control
slightly failed him the appearance of
the student on the heels of what bur-
ton tandy had told him at the university
the previous day seemed uncanny a
sudden fear clutched him at the thought
that sumner already might be moved
to retaliation but in a moment he was
himself again cool calculating ready
to fence to the last thrust and to take
advantage of any opening

  what can i do for you mr sum-
ner

  in turn the young man was surprised
i had a letter from you yesterday ask-
ing me to call he replied no par-
ticular time was set but i happened to
be coming into town to-day and here i
am

  bland was puzzled only a moment
he recalled having tossed the letter to
tandy and that the latter had thrown
it down on his desk some one he de-
cided must have mailed it

  i recall now said the lawyer hold-
ing open the gate wont you come
in he led the way into the private
office and indicated a chair facing his
desk will you excuse me a moment
until i get off an important telegram

  sumner was glad of the delay when
his eyes fell upon a map which was
pinned upon the wall behind the lawyer
he recognized the familiar lines of the
region inside the cape where lay the
coal locations on which he set such
store there was a considerable area
blocked off in blue pencil on which he
made out tandy estate lettered in
white running out from this were
several red blotches marked option
a white strip in the center of these was
unmarked but he readily recognized
that this followed the general lines of
his own coal location-the dusk vein

  what particularly interested him
however was a profile sketch which had
been inserted on the water portion of
the enlarged map this comprised a
series of bunkerlike docks obviously
coal pockets his heart began a terrific
hammering of elation with the convic-
tion that they extended from his own
property into a small natural harbor
which was the only available shipping
point for miles along the precipitous
shore of the straits of fuca

  that this momentary inspection of
the map was worth many thousands
to him came to mind at once until
that moment he had not realized the
value of his almost exclusive frontage
on the only safe harbor in the district
according to the coloring the tandy
estate owned three acres to his one and
had options on as many more but he
held the key to the situation and they
would have to pay before he would
unlock the door particularly would
they have to pay since the estate that
would soon come to his enemy was so
vitally concerned

  as bland threw down his pen indi-
cating that the telegram was finally
worded to his satisfaction sumner dis-
creetly withdrew his gaze the law-
yer stepped into the outer office and
summoned a district messenger when
he returned the students gaze was in-
nocently directed out of a window that

commanded a view of elliot bay the
queen citys magnificent harbor

  fine view that was blands re-
mark

  sumner heard his step quicken and
without turning his head he knew that
bland had approached the wall wthere
hung the detail map

  its one advantage of having an of-
fice on an upper floor the lawyer con-
tinued but you can be sure they
make us pay for it and if the eleva-
tors ever went on strike-but theres
no danger of that

  when the junior again turned to
face the desk the map wras gone from
the wall its removal wras a most con-
vincing proof that it portrayed the real
plans of the interests that had acquisi-
tive eyes on flattery coal now he
was doubly forearmed

  youll pardon my absent-mindedness
outside apologized the lawyer i
wrote that letter day before yesterday
and a great deal has come up since
to make me forget the fact when i
wrote i was most interested in seeing
you i thought i was in a position to
make you an offer to buy your location
outright or at least to acquire an op-
tion covering the next few months
im open to propositions said sum-
ner hoping the other would mention
some figure on which he could base his
calculations in view of the information
that had just come to him

  but the deal is all off for the pres-
ent at least returned bland my
clients have called a halt just why i
dont know but orders are orders in
these corporation matters i was just
about to write you that you need not
take the trouble to come in

  this unexpected turn calling off
negotiations before they were begun
puzzled sumner but remembering the
covert concealment of the map he kept
the fact from showing in his face evi-
dently some game of bluff was under
way and he prepared to play it

  in that case ill not detain you any
longer mr bland he said with un-
feigned cheerfulness why should he
not be cheerful he asked himself in
view of what he had learned that
was worth a thousand trips to the city

  dont be in a hurry urged bland
im still interested in coal even if my
present clients have weakened from
what i hear youve got a big proposi-
tion out at the cape	

  it is a whale said sumner con-
fidently

  but it is going to take big capital
to put those black diamonds on the mar-
ket the little man temporized i
wouldnt worry about that though if i
were you men with the proper amount
of foresight will happen along one day
and youll be able to turn a pretty penny
arent you rather young to have ac-
quired such holdings the question
was casual and the tone of it most
friendly

  old enough to hold on until i get
my price i guess was sumners re-
turn he did not add as he might
have done with truth that he had dis-
covered the coal bed seven years be-
fore when on a hunting trip near
his home and had been forced to keep
it secret for three years until he became
of age and could locate it for himself
but he did ask a question that gave the
lawyer another uneasy moment i un-
derstand that the tandy estate owns
a large tract to the east of me might
i ask how the owner came to invest
there 

  blands eyes were fixed upon the
younger man but to his relief they sawr
nothing but curiosity behind the ques-
tion tandy was a pioneer and he
knew the state like a book his in-
vestments are scattered far and wide

  sumner was at a loss to explain the
lawyers praise of the dusk vein the
natural comments of a prospective pur-
chaser would have been disparaging
yet he refrained from further question-
as the arrow to the bow



ing fearing to show an eagerness to sell
and arose from his chair

  if you want a little gratuitous ad-
vice young man said bland walking
with him toward the door hold to your
coal property if you go hawking it
around the market youll never get a
price wait until some one comes along
who wants it

  the junior smiled his satisfaction as
the door of the outer office closed be-
hind him in his gratuitous advice-
bland had exposed his hand for some
reason he was not ready to negotiate
at the moment but the deal was by no
means abandoned and he desired to
keep sumner from seeking other mar-
kets

  thanks to his floral trade and the
remnant of his savings he could afford
to wait meanwhile he would inquire
further into the coincidence of the ap-
pearance of his one enemy as a factor
in the proposition

chapter vii

the call of the tribe

the tang in the air of the decem-
ber afternoon was sharp enough to
make strenuous muscular effort a de-
light robert sumner was quite ready
to agree with zach liddell that it was
impossible to find a more exhilarating
outdoor sport than acting as motive
power to a single shell as he bent his
powerful back dipped into the water
with his purple-bladed oars and pulled
with an exact expenditure of strength
his slender craft shot through the lake
like a thing alive

  an accurate balance gained from his
lifelong experience with canoes of the
natives had been his from the begin-
ning nor had he taken long to acquire
the knack of keeping the wheeled seat
on its narrow track minor faults such
as rushing his slide bending his arms
or letting his shoulders go out for
the reach he had corrected almost

as soon as the coach had pointed them
out he was now rowing with a finish
that repeatedly called forth liddells
praise so far as form went he might
have foregone the single shell but the
eights composed of advanced oarsmen
would not take to the lake for some
weeks yet and the coach advised that
he correct an overdevelopment of arms
and shoulder muscles by continuing
with the single

  with a woven skullcap on his head
and clad in a sweater coat he was bowl-
ing up the lake watching the play of the
rowing muscles in his bare legs when
a contralto shout from inshore attracted
his attention pausing at the end of a
finished stroke he looked up and saw
mrs sumner in a canoe she beckoned
him with her paddle and a few long-
swung strokes brought him alongside

  bold face fish and broad head
are at the cabin boy she said in an
expressionless sort of voice

  men from home he cried that
should cheer you up mother youll
fairly revel in gossip of the bay but
why are you not entertaining them until
i come

  they are too quiet she returned
worried nothing to say except they
must see you quick thats why i
came for you

  robert expressed his surprise that the
three most prominent men of the home
village should particularly want to see
him this was the first time any one
from neah bay had made any effort
to seek out his secluded habitation

  they could not - find you at the
school so they came to the cabin the
woman continued there is trouble

  trouble

  with the government they are
sad

  the concluding remark brought some
illumination for he knew that his peo-
ple had grave negotiations pending with
the authorities at washington still
he did not understand why they should


top-notch magazine

have sought him out as his clothes
were at the boathouse he explained that
he would have to row back there but
he promised to return home as rapidly
as he could travel the short-cut trail he
had blazed through the woods

  an hour later he stepped in upon the
silent somber-faced group in his own
living room three old men sat in stiff
discomfort in chairs before the fire
lucy sumner overcome by the dignity
of the unexpected guests from home
had drawn her inevitable rocking-chair
into a corner

  greetings and salutations old
friends cried robert cheerily this
is a most delightfuf surprise we are
honored

  with their wrinkled faces as un-
moved as if they had been graven
images the three visitors arose and
solemnly shook his hand

  it is well said bold face the
youngest of the three

  good  muttered fish who was dis-
tinguished by a head flattened into a
peak

  a guttural grunt was all that came
from broad head whose coarse hair
was as white as the crest of a wave

  bold face held the floor his back
to the fire as the others resumed their
chairs we have come- he began

  sumner checked him with a gesture
but first tell me that you will stay
for supper he interpreted the an-
swering chorus of grunts as affirma-
tive mother our friends will eat with
us when you are ready he said to her
is there anything i can do to help

  nothing she answered disappear-
ing into the lean-to that served them
as kitchen

  now chief what brings you ques-
tioned robert

  this titulary dignitary of the tribes
which dwell among the olympics lapsed
at once into his native chinook tongue
with which the junior was conversant
and poured out a stream of guttural

words that were rich in sibilant notes
it seemed that a group of capitalists had
turned their covetous eyes upon the ex-
tensive area of tribal lands which lay
between the straits and the mountains
these were rich in timber and mineral
deposits although not suitable for cul-
tivation through certain political con-
nections these capitalists had introduced
a bill in congress providing for a sale
of the lands in bulk at a ridiculous
price per acre the argument was that
the indians were not making use of
their property that the timber and min-
eral wealth would forever be beyond
their powers of development and that
it would be folly to throw the lands
open to settlement in the usual way
because of the nature of the country

  the chiefs it seemed had been ap-
prised of the bill through the watch-
fulness of one of the eastern societies
that have the welfare of the red man
at heart they had protested to the
commissioner of indian affairs at the
capital and had won his sympathy

  his last letter brings us to you
concluded bold face handing-over an
official-looking envelope

  sumner broke the silence he had
maintained throughout the chiefs out-
line of the case to the extent of one
word  thieves then he slipped the
letter from the envelope and read

  i am greatly distressed over this wicked
attempt to despoil your people of the olym-
pic lands your title to which was estab-
lished by solemn treaty and the pledged
word of the government the situation is
most grave for the clique that desires the
land is possessed of far-reaching influence
the congressman who should be most alert
to protect your interests seems to be hand
and glove with the interests the best that
i have been able to do for you through
friends in congress is to have the bill re-
ferred to an impartial committee and to ar-
range for a public hearing

  this committee will be in seattle on janu-
ary th next and will hear the indian side
of the controversy at a session held in the
auditorium of the university of washington
on that date it is my advice that you ap-
as the arrow to the bow



point as spokesman that tribesman best
fitted to set your arguments against this
despoliation before the congressmen it will
do no harm if as many of you as can do so
attend the session but leave the talking to
one or at most two tribesmen it would not
be wise for you to retain a paid attorney
whose influence could not be as great as that
of one of the tribe

  the young man was silent for a mo-
ment before he returned the missive to
bold face thank heaven theres
one official who is on the square he
cried whom have you decided on
for the argument

  robert sumner tilacum said the
chief accenting their word for friend

  the young mans surprise was genu-
ine that these venerable chiefs whom
he had known all his life had come to
enlist his aid in preparing their argu-
ment had occurred to him as soon as
he had heard of the commission how-
ever he had not dreamed that they had
decided on him as the one best equipped
as spokesman

  his initial protest was impelled by
modesty but chief fish at once chal-
lenged it you are best fitted for this
task robert sumner he said with ob-
vious pride as the stream runs to the
ocean so the ready speech passes your
lips as the arrow to the bow is so
is your argument to our salvation your
words will take the direct way to the
minds of these white chiefs remem-
ber that you are one of us do not de-
sert us in this moment of our great ex-
tremity we have but you to depend
on

  but-but the mixed blood pro-
tested the student the flush of excite-
ment staining the bronze of his face
would it not be better if a full mem-
ber of the tribe-

  there lies your chief advantage
continued fish who was noted among
his people for his shrewd mind from
us you have your keenness of observa-
tion your love of freedom and your
contempt for the insect things of life

with your white blood you inherit bold-
ness initiative the ability to turn the
hand and mind to whatever is before
you surely the best of two races is
better than the good and bad of one
we have watched you grow robert
sumner we have all been fathers to
you in the past but now we come to you
as brothers asking you to help us
who are weak to help us with your
strength

  the venerable broad head forgot his
taciturnity long enough to add his word
which took the form of a paternal com-
mand and the promise that if sumner
saved the tribal lands he would never be
without good medicine

  silence fell on them the tribesmen
watched with alternating doubt and
hope on their faces the evident mental
struggle of the young man was he
going to shirk the task they brought to
him would he turn his back upon
them when so much was at stake  they
followed his strong steps as he paced
about the room his head bent in deep
thought questioning his own fitness to
act as spokesman then suddenly their
expressions showed as much of radiance
as a siwash ever permits to appear

  robert sumner had thrown back his
head and stood facing them with agree-
ment in his first word

  all right he cried as you seem
agreed that this is my duty  will do
my best with it i am one of you and
i am not ashamed of the fact it seemed
wisest to say nothing about my indian
blood when first i came to the univer-
sity now it would be only weakness
to conceal the fact any longer let
every one know my only hope is that
i can live up to the part

chapter viii

a high resolve

the chiefs gathered about him with
expressions of pride and gratitude
sumner regretted his momentary reluc-

tance to undertake what they asked he
assured them that he would at once be-
gin a study of the treaties under which
their lands had been ceded he would
search the law library of the university
for precedents which woyld be appli-
cable in their favor the tribe should
have the best that was in him and he
would not count the cost of time or
effort

  after the chiefs had partaken of a
cheerful meal they stalked off in the
darkness toward the car line heading
for the steamer that had replaced the
puget belle on the run to ports along
the straits not until he was alone did
the full meaning of his decision strike
home to him the disclosure to the
world of the secret which he had
guarded so zealously during the first
years of his emergence from the nar-
row limits of the west-coast settle-
ment was to come after all from his
own lips it would not be possible to
wait for burton tandy to carry out the
threat that had evidently beenpostponed
through business policy the moment
he stepped forward as spokesman for
the olympic tribes every one would
know that he was a si wash a half-
breed

  realization of what he had promised
to face came over him as he consid-
ered the possibilities undoubtedly the
auditorium would be filled with fellow
students eager spectators of so unusual
a feature of public business the pro-
fessors of american history civics psy-
chology and oratory would doubtless
urge attendance upon their classes it
was incumbent upon him to strike heav-
ily for his people in his address to
the congressmen but at the same time
there was nothing to prevent his be-
speaking justice for himself he would
fling them the challenge he had voiced
to tandy that day when exposure was
first threatened he would measure
definitely and for all time the depth of
the prejudice which these white broth-

ers and sisters probably felt if they
withheld fellowship then he wanted no
further association with them and he
would do without an education rather
than take it from an alleged civilization
that considered him a pariah

  one regret tinged his meditations
upon the new situation it would be
necessary for him to give up his row-
ing practice the preparation of his
argument in behalf of his tribe would
require hours of patient study the
time for this added effort could be
taken neither from his university work
nor from the flower growing upon
which his livelihood depended he de-
cided to go to zach liddell with the
frank statement that an added respon-
sibility which could not be shirked
would prevent his further use of the
shell

  if tandys forecast of crew sentiment
had been correct he might better give
up the oars then than later when every
one knew who he was but if tandy
had been wrong and if the crew men 
were still willing to row with a si wash
there would still be time for him to
make the effort

  as the fire in the hearth died down
with the approach of bedtime a vivid
picture of charlotte crawford appeared
in the gray-blue smoke of his pipe it
seemed that she was not after all to
hear of his mixed origin from the lips
of his rival yet he-could imagine no
more propitious setting for his self-dis-
closure than that which the hearing
would afford when lie stepped from out
the group of his people to plead their
protection from the rapacious white cap-
italists he would see that she attended
the public hearing

  this crowded day was not to end
however without one more surprise it
was furnished by mrs sumner as he
started to close the cabin for the night

  wait robert she said coming into
the circle of light thrown by his stu-
dent lamp all evening she had rocked
as the arrow to the bow



in moody silence at the side of the
hearth no good can come of this
thing which they ask you to do it
means trouble for you the rich whites
you oppose will never forget they will
ruin your life and mine leave this
school before they drive you away let
us go to my cousins in british columbia
and start afresh you will become a
great man among white fathers who
keep their word and do not despise the
indian

  for a moment the young man stared
at her in amazement he had never
known her to show initiative until the
time a few weeks before when she
had begged him tp leave the university
and return home that she should so
far forget the self-effacement inborn
with indian women as to propose this
migration to the canadian province
across the straits was almost beyond be-
lief he recalled that the change in
her dated from a visit which tandy had
paid her in his absence and again he
wondered what the senior might have
said or threatened whatever had
passed between them she had steadfastly
refused to disclose and he did not fur-
ther question her now

  come with me my boy she urged

  no mother we will stay and fight
the tone of his response was firm al-
though it lacked nothing of filial re-
spect there is a mans work to be
done the chiefs have trusted it to me
they have returned home with my ac-
ceptance of the responsibility and come
what may i shall not turn my back
upon it

  this has been an evil day muttered
the indian woman resigning herself to
fate with  helpless gesture i have
done wrhat i could to spare us
now-

  now we will give them a battle to
remember cried sumner tossing back
the lock of black hair that in meditative
moments had a habit of falling over his

csa

forehead a battle they will remem-

the chosen spokesman

  robert sumner predicted the
whole university faculty and stu-
dents alike betrayed the liveliest interest
in the visit of the congressional com-
mittee that was to haar the indian pro-
test the arrival of six or seven war
canoes a day previous to that set for
the hearing intensified this interest and
gave a promise of standing room only
that would have delighted the heart of
a showman

  the chiefs giving heed to the official
suggestion that it would be advisable to
make a tribal showing had recruited a
considerable delegation as time was a
lesser object to them than the cash nec-
essary for steamer fares they had
loaded up their largest canoes with
camping paraphernalia hoisted sail and
essayed the long voyage although
male tribesmen predominated some had
brought their women and children and
even a stray dog or two of nondescript
breed the camp which they established
on the lake shore near the campus was
sufficiently picturesque to draw many
visitors

  at the hour of the hearing the great
assembly hall in the auditorium was
crowded the two foremost rows of
seats were reserved for the indian vis-
itors although only the men of the dele-
gation put in an appearance the squaws
being left in charge of the temporary
camp the showing which the siwashes
made was exceedingly creditable every
man of them was fully clad in store
clothes while flannel shirts predomi-
nated several of the chiefs attained the
dignity of starched collars the faces
of all were impressively serious

  the congressmen filed out upon the
stage and took seats about a table which
had been arranged for them at one side
they listened to a brief welcoming

speech from a faculty representative
after which their chairman announced
that they were ready to hear any argu-
ment which the indians cared to make
against the sale of their lands

  with a dignity of manner for which
the american native has ever been fa-
mous in official negotiations chief bold
face arose and gravely saluted the na-
tional lawmakers

  wont you take the platform sug-
gested the chairman

  no said the chief i speak only
a moment

  disappointment showed in the faces
of the mass of students who filled the
assembly room to the last chair no
hint of the realplan on which the in-
dians had decided had come to them
their appetites were whetted for out-
bursts of indian oratory and no per-
functory speech would satisfy them
even the congressman looked surprised

  my tongue is thick continued the
chief my words are too light to ex-
press the heaviness of our hearts in
our own chinook i might address you
but you would not understand upon
one of our young men must fall the task
of showing you the grevious wrrong that
threatens us he has the education of
you white brothers but his heart is
ours the truth and nothing but the
truth will spring from his lips to your
understanding

  his steady gaze passed from face to
face among the assembled students un-
til it rested upon sumners tense counte-
nance

  come my son he said gesturing
dramatically toward the stage

  a murmur of astonishment a whis-
per of incredulity ran through the stu-
dent body when the mystery student
arose from his seat at the end of the
row and stepped forward confidently
as he passed bold face the chief
clapped an encouraging hand upon his
shoulder and guttural exclamations of

approval came from the throats of other
tribesmen

  in her seat halfway back in the cen-
ter section sat charlotte crawford
scarce believing her senses striving val-
iantly to mask her surprise in case any
of the few intimates who knew of her
friendship for the junior should be
within visual range

  so this was the cloud which had hung
over her rescuer - here at last was the
reason for his studied aloofness his per-
sistent self-effacement his refusal to re-
spond to social overtures a half-breed
siwash her mind seethed with con-
flicting emotions she could not think
dimly she realized that she would
rather at that moment be anywhere else
than where she was

  she knew that he had reached the
stage by now had bowed to the con-
gressmen and was speaking she
forced herself to listen

  if you will bear with me one mo-
ment he said i shall make my own
position clear establish my privilege to
speak for the men and women and par-
ticularly for the little children of the
olympic tribes i am a siwash-a half-
breed indian  he threw back his head
as he spoke and from several quarters
charlotte heard the comment whispered
that he did not look the part this is
the third year of my residence in this
institution and the first time it has
seemed advisable to declare my racial
mixture my reasons for silence in the
past are varied a disinclination for
controversy was one a desire to gain
an education without the handicap of
possible prejudice was another shame
for my mothers race was at no time a
part of it such shame as i have is for
my white father whom i have never
seen with knowing eyes for be deserted
us before i had learned to walk gladly
do i now cast my lot with my red kins-
men my brothers before you i am a
siwash and as such i come to you with
our plea for justice
as the arrow to the bow



  although his eyes were upon the con-
gressmen none could doubt that this
opening was particularly directed to his
fellow students the unofficial majority
of his audience but his words were
not without effect upon the three law-
makers whom he particularly desired to
move no amount of preparation could
have worded a preface more sure of
capturing their sympathy his manly
stand for his own people his defiance of
any imputation of inequality for these
original americans of which he was
one could not fail to appeal

  in one of the back rows sat burton
tandy in sullen-faced amazement it
seemed that his one hold upon his rival
was slipping away the breed had
capitalized his disadvantage of birth
and seemed about to declare dividends
of popularity because of it never be-
fore had robert sumner loomed so om-
inously before him he recalled the
admonition of r choate bland that
there was danger to their plans in arous-
ing the young man from the straits
it seemed now that the junior had
aroused himself yet for that moment
at least the senior was powerless to do
aught but sit and listen

  on the stage the pleader for the in-
dians had plunged into a brief review
of the treaties with the government that
had led to the final settlement of the
tribes in the shadow of the coast range
they had given full value in the lands
they had formerly occupied along puget
sound for the new home to which they
had been removed the fee to the tract
which was now in jeopardy he declared
rested absolutely in them

  it is intolerable to believe he cried
that the highest legislative body in this
republic will ignore the essential feature
of an agreement entered into with the
utmost solemnity of form that con-
gress will force this sale upon us be-
cause we are too feeble toresist the
affront

  he took up the arguments which lob-

byists for interested corporations had
offered to congress as reason for the
sale it was true that the land was not
such as could profitably be thrown open
to settlement as had been so many other
reservations in different parts of the
west its formation did not lend itself
to cultivation and it would never be
valuable either for farming or grazing

  yet these mountainous acres did hold
a vast wealth of timber of coal of oil
and of precious metals to say nothing of
the water power that awaited develop-
ment there was no possible way of
estimating the value of this assorted
treasure but itwas preposterous he ar-
gued to sell the vast tract for a few
dollars an acre-dollars which would be
distributed to the indians in driblets
and do them more harm than good

  one of the congressmen interrupted
to ask whether the attitude of the indi-
ans against the sale was not analogous
to the dog-in-the-manger fable your
people cannot develop the lands for
themselves he suggested and do not
want to see others make use of them

  the junior had foreseen this objec-
tion and was ready with an answer that
seemed not less daring because it was
obviously practical

  my people would welcome develop-
ment if only their interests were con-
served he assured them why would
it not be wise to organize the allied
tribes into a joint stock company in
which every member should be an equal
shareholder  then the natural assets
of the reservation might be released for
development to capitalists among the
whites under such regulations as the
government thought advisable the re-
turns to be paid to the stockholders at
periodic intervals in the form of corpo-
rate dividends 

  sumner closed with a final plea that
they be given a chance to administer
this wealth under conditions that would
assure them something like a just por-
tion of its return presenting each mem-

ber of the committee with a copy of the
written brief which he had prepared
he left the platform and dropped into an
empty seat beside the three chiefs
among his own people

  the moment of silence which fol-
lowed his final appeal was broken by a
ripple of applause that started some-
where among the students and grew into
an uproar if the verdict had rested
with the undergraduates the indians
would have won hands down

                                                                  

  when quiet was restored the chair-
man of the committee smiling amiably
stepped forward if we were in con-
gress he said it would be necessary
for the sergeant-at-arms to clear the gal-
lery after such a demonstration under
existing circumstances however we
withhold our frowns without enter-
ing into the merits of the grave matter
before us i am impelled to congratu-
late the tribes from the olympic coun-
try on the possession of so logical an
advocate as the young man who has
just addressed us any university might
well be proud to have such a man among
its undergraduates and i am glad that
you have already signified your appro-
val of his stand in behalf of his people
all that he has said shall have our ear-
nest consideration

  when the congressmen had filed out
robert sumner signaled to his people
that the hearing was ended and started
with them down the center aisle at
one side an enthusiastic cheer leader
mounted a chair

  now then fellows he cried a
long one for bob sumner

  the yell of the college composed in
part of siwash words rang out with the
force of hundreds of throats and at
the end sumners name thrice repeated
was given with a will of the varied
notes none was more ringing with en-
thusiasm than that of charlotte craw-
ford whose mystery student no longer
existed but was replaced by one who

had proven himself so candid and
brave

   burton tandy did not tarry about the
campus that day but hurried into seat-
tle to consult attorney bland upon the
unexpected development

  of those who sought out robert
sumner after the indians had broken
camp none was more enthusiastic than
professor alex darrow under whom
he was specializing in biology

   if i were professor of oratory sum-
ner said the giant faculty member
heartily i should hand you all the
credits in the course for your perform-
ance this morning how is it that you
never happened to mention you are of
indian blood on one parental side

   when i first came to the university
there was no one here who knew of me
and until my people happened to need
-me it seemed wisest to say nothing
about my extraction answered the
junior i feared a prejudice which
from the way i was treated to-day
proves to have been groundless

   but dont you realize what a prom-
ising study in heredity you present
cried the enthusiastic experimenter
the mere fact of your having so few
indian characteristics that in more than
two years none suspected you marks a
unique case who was your father-
what sort of man i mean

  when i learned some years ago
that my father was a white man i had
a natural curiosity to learn who he was
and what had become of him replied
sumner it proved one of the few
subjects on which my mother has been
evasive with me on seeing how my
questions distressed her i ceased ask-
ing the men of the tribe to whom i
appealed were nearly as unsatisfactory
the subject is not a pleasing one to
them they declared that he had left
the straits when i was a baby and that
they had heard nothing further from
him

   but well have to know urged the
as the arrow to the bow



professor we must find out all about
him you owe it to yourself

  as he walked home through the tim-
ber that evening robert sumner found
that the question raised by professor
darrow remained uppermost in his
mind who was his father  that mys-
tery of his life which had been stilled
since the failure of his early efforts
demanded solution he felt anew a
poignant desire to know himself in no
other way could he realize his limita-
tions or take measures to combat them
a decision to renew his efforts was
solemnly declared to the wind that whis-
pered through the cedars

chapter x

no bar sinister

hphe days immediately following his
plea for the olympic tribes were
full of readjustment for robert sum-
ner in a hundred ways he was made to
feel that the student body approved of
his stand with one bound he had
sprung from obscurity into a promi-
nence that was trying to his naturally
retiring disposition in one day he had
transformed himself from the least-
known student into the one most promi-
nent he might have broken a track
record or carried over a winning touch-
down with far less notoriety

  the few with whom he had had a
speaking acquaintance through class or
laboratory work were kept busy intro-
ducing others who had never noticed
him in former days many of these he
knew were moved only by curiosity
others were of the follow-the-crowd
type who feared being themselves un-
known by not having met the new celeb-
rity but the number who seemed sin-
cere in seeking acquaintance was large
enough to warm his heart and to give
him a new interest in life

  he was moved to wonder where he
had ever gained the impression that his
indian ancestry would be a bar to social

life at the university one faculty mem-
ber after congratulating him on his ar-
gument pointed out that washington
was a university of pioneers and ex-
pressed regret that more indian youths
did not prepare themselves to take ad-
vantage of its educational offerings

  the president of the associated stu-
dents which office is the highest honor
at the gift of the undergraduates sought
him out and secured his promise to take
charge of the trail-blazing squad that
was to run lines for new campus paths
these the students would build on
campus day early in march when
every one turns out for an old-fashioned
out-of-doors house cleaning

  perhaps the most striking instance
that college democracy was real came
when a senior member of one of the
most powerful fraternities invited him
to dinner at the chapter house

  chance kept him on the anxious seat
for a time regarding the matter which
was nearest his heart-the attitude of
the girl he had saved from the wreck
he knew only that she had been one
of the throng in the auditorium that
eventful morning but he had been too
entirely wtrapped up in his plea to send
even a glance in the direction of her
seat his experience with femininity
was so limited that he had no basis for
supposition regarding the effect upon
her of his startling declaration as to his
race and he anxiously awaited their
first chance meeting on the campus
when a single glance would assure him
of her continued friendship or make
him miserable again

  this afternoon as he stood in the
classic portal of the chemistry building
he saw her coming up the roadway with
the swinging style characteristic of the
outdoor life to which she was devoted
satisfied that she had not yet noticed
him he was seized with a momentary
temptation to evade the issue by re-
treating into the building the results
of that first meeting were bound to be


top-notch magazine

momentous for him either for joy or
sorrow and he dreaded learning his
fate

  but at once he took a grip upon him-
self chiding his thought of retreat as
unworthy his new attitude toward him-
self timing his pace so that he would
reach the foot of the broad flight of
stone steps as she passed he started to-
ward her his heart was beating tu-
multuously but he held firm in his de-
termination that the question of her
friendship-whether or no it was broad
enough to include a half-breed-should
be definitely settled without further
delay

  when she was forty paces up the
road and he was on the last flight of
steps he felt rather than saw that she
had noticed him the moment for him
was cruel with suspense then her cor-
dial greeting banished all fears

  hello she called hello demos-
thenes sumner im going your way
if youll wait a moment

  the girl had not changed she knew
he was a siwash and she was still his
friend the flush that suffused his
bronze cheeks was one of shame that he
had ever questioned so fine a young
woman he did not try to keep the
note of glad relief out of his voice as
he returned her salutation

  first off she said on joining him
let me tell you that it was splendid i
heard every word of your plea and if
congress doesnt let your people keep

their lands- well ill think a lot

less of that august body than i do now
  you were surprised he asked

  i was surprised the first minute or
two every one was you might have
prepared me at least but i think i un-
derstand how you felt of course you
had misjudged us but you could not
have known that only made what you
did all the finer im glad youve found
out that were not snobs

  every one has been very kind a
sort of treatment we indians dont al-

ways get from our white brothers it
makes me want to do something big-
something for so real a university

  the call for candidates for the var-
sity crew will be posted to-morrow i
hear she said significantly

  a shadow crossed his face im not
sure that ill be welcome at the boat-
house liddell did not like the idea of
my breaking training you see i could
not go into detail regarding my rea-
sons

  but he knows the reasons now you
may be sure she continued urgently
of course with that argument to pre-
pare you had no time to spare for any-
thing else the coach will understand
and if i were you id go to him at once
im particularly and personally anxious
that you make the crew for mother has
promised to take me to poughkeepsie
next june to see our eight row-and
win

  sumner congratulated her at the
pleasant prospect of a trip across the
continent but he added that so far as
his rowing was concerned there were
other factors than the coachs displeas-
ure which might prevent his trying
there was for instance at least one
member of the crew squad who did not
care to row in the same boat with a
siwash

  i know the member you have in
mind cried charlotte her eyes flash-
ing and i dont mind telling you that
i am indignant with burton tandy he
had better leave his snobbery in seat-
tle or hell find himself out of the boat
why does he hate you so it cannot
be entirely because-

  he knew i was an indian long be-
fore i announced the fact said the
young man dispassionately unless i
followed a certain course which he laid
down he was going to expose me i
did not obey yet for some reason he
held his tongue anyway miss craw-
ford it mightbe best for the college if
i forget rowing i was thinking of try-
as the arrow to the bow



ing for the track team i can run a lit-
tle naturally since foot racing has al-
ways been one of our-

  dont you think of track she inter-
rupted you are built to order for
the crew so do make peace with lid-
dell

  the fact that his real interest was in
the aquatic sport as much as the girls
urging led him that very afternoon
to the boathouse but peacemaking
proved to have  place on the program
as he speedily learned to his sorrow

  well tilacum its about time you
were reporting to uncle zach that you
are ready to become a galley slave for
the honor of the purple and gold the
coachs use of the chinook word for
friend was his way of proving that
he recognized no lines of caste when it
came to picking crew material

  i was sorry i had to quit the single
shell said sumner but i had no
choice under the circumstances are
you sure that my indian origin
isnt--

  enough on that point sumner
liddell interposed there is only one
bar sinister in athletics in this fount of
learning and that is professionalism i
know youre o k on that score re-
port to-morrow at four and prove to
me that my eyes still know an oarsman
when they see one

  it seemed to sumner that nothing
was left to complete his happiness he
was known by all the university for
what he really was and accepted at par
by all except tandy and a few of his
satellites who did not count his fa-
vorite sport was open to him and a seat
in the poughkeepsie boat would be his
if he earned it he had faced his duty
toward his people and done his best
for them his flowers were blooming
as they never had before so he was cer-
tain of making his financial riffle
miss crawford the one woman of his
interest had again proven her friend-
ship and friendship was all he had ever

aspired for in her case  what more
could a human being ask

  yet there was something more as he
realized poignantly when he entered the
cabin and his eyes caught the hopeless
look upon mrs sumners face her
eyes were so reddened that he would
have believed she had been crying had
he not known her unemotional nature
that she was wretched was one flaw he
had overlooked the reason for her
state of mind mystified him the visit
of women friends from the home tribe
who had made the canoe voyage with
the chiefs had not served to cheer her
and her doleful state distressed him the
more now that his own affairs were
working out so nicely

  crossing the room he stood behind
her chair and for a moment stroked
her shining black hair which she wore
parted in the center and brushed back
severely into a knot upon her neck

  cant you tell me the trouble
mother he said drawing up a chair
and sitting down beside her if there
is anything i can do to bring back your
happiness tell me do you want to
return to the bay and open the little
house there 

  she looked up quickly will you
come with me

  you should not ask the impossible
mother he said gently you know
how hard i have worked to get an edu-
cation and there must be another whole
year of school before i can settle down
the hopeless expression returned
it is not well for you to stay here now
that every one knows there is danger
to you to me to all of us

  what danger he asked

  it was not the first time she had
spoken vaguely of danger and now as
on past occasions he failed to get any
idea of its form he was beginning to
believe that it was a figment of her
imagination and to that of course he
could not yield his lifes ambition
there was one other subject that had


top-notch magazine

lately occupied much of his thought on
which she was equally unsatisfactory
each time he had returned to the sub-
ject of his father she had shown great
agitation once when he had pressed
his questions more strongly she flashed
upon him the first angry look he had
ever received from her he knew that
the subject must be painful to her but
felt that he had the right to know what
she could tell him and he was growing
impatient

  this evening however he made no
effort to resume the examination go-
ing into the kitchen with the idea of
preparing the evening meal in view of
her seeming indisposition he had barely
lighted the fire when she appeared and
waved him from the lean-to from the
fact that she soon set two of his favorite
dishes before him he knew that she
regretted having troubled him

  later as he sat over his books at the
study table there flashed into his mind
a likely way of learning about his father
without troubling her further at once
he acted upon the inspiration to the
extent of writing a letter

chapter xi

troubled consciences

the dining room of the club in which
r choate bland held a highly val-
ued membership was quite deserted
when the lawyer ushered in his most
profitable client yielding to epicurean
vanity he ordered a carefully selected
repast then as the waiter disappeared
with noiseless tread he turned to his
guest

  now burton begin your tale of
woe though the dinner which i have
just ordered deserves a more pleasant
appetizer what has your siwash
friend been up to

  things couldnt be worse out at the
u said tandy his voice heavy with
gloom that speech for the tribe was
a ten strike and hes got brains enough

to make the most of it hes playing
the hero all over the campus and peo-
ple are beginning to ask whohis white
father was

  the devil they are  muttered
bland what does any one want to
know that for

  what is there those faculty bugs
dont want to know theyre cracked
on experimentation this morning i
heard professor darrow saying what a
wonderful study in heredity sumner
would present if they could only secure
data on the paternal side if they ask
enough questions theyll stumble on
something sooner or later and then

there will-

  then i know a pair of wise birds
wholl have to get out from under
well heres one bird that wont do
anything of the sort declared tandy
if you think im going to give in to
that upstart from the straits youve
sadly mistaken your best meal ticket
a little nerve just now will pull us
through with every ducat present and
accounted for

  planting his elbows on the table
bland made a forked rest for his head
with his hands and lapsed into medita-
tion the tandy estate was indeed
his best meal ticket as the younger
man put it and the attorney had no
idea of loosening his clutch upon it un-
less that became absolutely necessary to
assure his own safety indeed he had
gone so deeply into the daring scheme
which burton tandy had proposed on
his fathers death two years before
that he doubted his ability to get out
clean if the storm ever broke at the
time the possible complication of rob-
ert sumners appearance in any promi-
nent role had seemed outside the prob-
abilities certainly fate had been play-
ing them some sorry tricks of late

  if you could only find a way of get-
ting him back on the reservation where
he belongs suggested the attorney
after a considerable period of medita-
as the arrow to the bow



tion how about that girl hes inter-
ested in if shed insult him now
mightnt he take to the woods with a
broken heart

  forget the girl bland in the first
place shes not going to do any insult-
ing in that quarter i saw her yester-
day walking with him on the campus
she knows i hate him i didnt play
the game right in the first instance
shes told me i neednt mention him
and unless i lie low im in danger of
losing out with her altogether

  dont they sometimes expel young
men who are caught cheating in exam-
inations the attorney asked sugges-
tively

  sumner isnt that sort hes straight
-worse luck

  but you could plant-

  too dangerous vetoed the senior
hes got too much reputation for high
marks behind him theres a bare
chance of our doing something -with the
old woman i threw another scare into
her to-day he thinks a lot of her and
she may persuade him to go back with
her but--

  the return of the waiter forced a
temporary silence

  when they were again alone bland
spoke a word of caution friend
burton be mighty careful about going
to see the mother if he finds you
prowling around there hell come down
on you hard physically it may also set
him thinking

  tandy offered prompt assurance that
he was using all necessary caution add-
ing that he held so powerful a club over
the indian woman that she would not
dream of reporting his visits

  i dont like the look of it com-
plained bland

  no more do i returned the stu-
dent dont you think its about time
you destroyed the paper in the case
with two witnesses alive youre
mad burton

  the witnesses are far enough away

theyll never be heard from burn the
confounded thing up then if he ever
does stumble on the truth hell whistle
himself hoarse trying to prove any-
thing

  well have nothing of that sort bur-
ton said bland decisively if those
witnesses turn up i can make another
search and save myself by finding the
document but if its burned theyll
get me for more than carelessness no
sir thats my only life preserver and
ill hold to it to the death

  youve got no nerve declared
tandy with indignation

  for a time both gave their outward
attention to the food that had been
placed before them but neither had a
really appreciative appetite

  youd better find some way of get-
ting him back where he came from
said the attorney finally he seems to
be a sensitive customer couldnt you
make a monkey of him wound his van-
ity get the fellows laughing at him
heavens if i had as much at stake as
you have id find a way

  ive got one scheme up my sleeve
admitted tandy somebody told him
he was an oarsman and hes set his
heart on making the crew miss craw-
ford is egging him on i believe and
the coach has encouraged him now
ive got some influence in rowing cir-
cles pull a pretty strong oar myself
and helped then raise the money to
send the crew east last year i may be
able to put the kibosh on him a little
later quiet work you know a whis-
per here and there that an indian on the
eight wont help our standing any in
the east if i can get two or three
others to pull against him hell lose the
boat and the jar may break his nerve
his mother is anxious enough to join
some relatives over in british colum-
bia but i suppose that is too much to
hope for

  in part to ease an exceedingly guilty
conscience r choate bland arose and


top-notch magazine

began to pace the deserted dining room
with a jerky nervous step in his mind
he was revolving the probabilities of a
daring idea that had come to him while
tandy was speaking this he decided
involved a greater risk than he cared
to run except as an extreme measure
but there was the advantage that if it
worked the danger to burton tandys
heritage which now threatened would
be dissipated for all time

  it might be done he said aloud as
he completed one of his turns about the
room

  what might be done you thinking
pedestrian demanded tandy who was
familiar with blands mental processes

  i was thinking that if your plans fall
through and the troublesome one in-
sists on learning about his father we
might invent one for him

  the senior laughed youd better
try for a patent on that invention
bland we couldnt invent a father
we might hire an aged dodderer to
throw open his arms to his noble child
you say you have a hold on the squaw
would it carry that far she is the
only one competent to enter objection
tandys expressidn brightened as he
caught the scope of the attorneys sug-
gestion i declare you did have an
inspiration after all the woman will
do as i tell her for reasons best known
to the two of us have you any one
in mind for the parental role

  not so fast young man checked
bland resuming his chair at the table
as the coffee was brought in that-
scheme is a wild one at best and only
to be used if the case reaches the stage
of last resort it means giving at least
one other scoundrel a grip on us and its
bound to be expensive you go on with
your plan to shame the sivvash back into
the obscurity from which he should
never have been permitted to emerge
ill do it never fear returned
tandy keep your eye on me ill
work at it day and night if necessary

before i am through with robert sum-
ner hell not only give up the attempt to
finish his college course but in disgrace

advertised in cipher

ne rainy morning in april
luther trant sat -alone in
his office on his wrist as
he bent closely over a heap
of typewritten pages spread
before him on his desk a small instru-
ment in continual motion ticked like a
watch it was for him an hour of idle-
ness  he was reading fiction and with
his passion for making visible and re-
cording the workings of the mind he
was taking a permanent record of his
feelings as he read

 the instrument strapped on trants
arm was called a sphygmograph it car-
ried a small steel rod which pressed
tightly on his wrist artery this rod
rising and falling with each rush of the
blood wave through the artery trans-
mitted its motion to a system of small
levers these levers operated a pencil
point which touched the surface of a
revolving drum trant had adjusted
around this drum a strip of smoked pa-
per the pencil point traced on its sooty
surface and a continuous wavy line

which rose and fell with each beat of
the psychologists pulse

  as the interest of the story gripped
trant this wavy line grew flatter with
elevations farther apart when the in-
terest flagged his pulse returned to its
normal beat and the line became regular
in its undulations at an exciting in-
cident the elevations swelled to greater
height and the psychologist was
noting with satisfaction how the con-
tinual variations of the line gave
definite record of the storys sustained
power when he was interrupted by the
sharp ring of his telephone

  an excited choleric voice came over
the wire

 mr trant    this is
cuthbert edwards of cuthbert ed-
wards  co michigan avenue you
have received a communication from
my son winton this morning is he
there now    no then he
will reach your office in a very few
minutes i want nothing done in the
matter you understand i will reach
your office myself as soon as possible-
probably within fifteen minutes-and
explain


top-notch magazine

  the sentence ended with a bump as
cuthbert edwards slammed his re-
ceiver back upon its hook the psy-
chologist who would have recognized
the name-even if not forewarned by
the communication lie had received that
morning-as the conservative head of
one of the oldest and most exclusive
families of new england puritan ex-
traction detached the sphygmograph
from his wrist and drew toward him
and reread the fantastic advertisement
that had come to him inclosed in win-
ton edwards letter apparently it had
been cut from the classified columns
of one of the big dailies

  eva  the seventeenth of the tenth since
you and your own are safe do you become
insensible that others now again wait in your
place  and those that swing in the wind
have you forgot if you remember and are
true communicate and you can help save
them all n m        

 

  the letter to the first page of which
the advertisement had been pinned was
dated the same day he had received it
postmarked three oclock that morning
and written in the scrawling hand of a
young man under strong emotion

  dear sir before coming to consult you
i send for your consideration the advertise-
ment you will find inclosed this advertise-
ment is the one tangible piece of evidence of
the amazing and inexplicable influence pos-
sessed by the hammering man over my
fiancee miss eva silber this influence has
forced her to refuse to marry me to tell me
that i must think of her only as if she were
dead

  this advertisement appeared first on last
monday morning in the classified columns
of three chicago papers published in english

and in the german s- on tuesday it

appeared in the same morning papers and
in four evening papers and the german

a- it was submitted to each newspaper

by mail with no address or information
other than the text as here printed with
three dollars in currency inclosed in each
case to pay for its insertion for heavens
sake help me mr trant i will call on
you this morning as soon as i think you are
at your office	winton edwards

  the psychologist had hardly finished
this letter when rapid footsteps in the
corridor outside stopped at his office
door never had there been a more
striking entrance into trants office
than that of the young man who now
burst in-disheveled wet with the rain
his eyes red for want of sleep

  she has left me mr trant he
cried with no prelude she has gone

  as he sank dazedly into a chair he
pulled from his pocket a small leather
case and handed it to the psychologist
within was the photograph of a re-
markably handsome girl in her early
twenties-a girl sobered by some un-
usual experience as showed most
plainly in the poise of her little round
head wrapped with its braid of lustrous
hair and the shadow that lurked in the
steadfast eyes though they were smil-
ing and the full lips were smiling too

  you are i suppose mr winton
edwards said trant picking up the
letter on his desk now if you have
come to me for help mr edwards you
must first give me all the information
of the case that you have

  that is eva silber young edwards
replied miss silber had been em-
ployed by us a little over a year she
came to us in answer to an advertise-
ment she gave us no information in
regard to herself when she came and
she has given none since because of
her marked ability my father put her
in complete charge of the houses cor-
respondence with our foreign agents
for in addition to english she speaks
and writes fluently german french the
magyar dialect of hungary russian
and spanish

  i was in love with her almost from
the first he went on in spite of my
fathers objection to the attachment
the first edwards of our family mr
trant came to massachusetts in 
so my father has the idea that anybody
who came later cannot possibly be our
equal and miss silber who came to
decidedly odd



america to work-the women of our
family have stayed idly at home-did
not get here until a short time ago

  coming from where asked the
psychologist

  i dont know the young man an-
swered simply i think she is an
austrian for the magyar dialect she
speaks is the least likely of the lan-
guages she knows to have been learned
by choice i spoke of this to her once
and she did not contradict me he
paused to control his agitation and then
went on she had so far as i know
no friends so you see mr trant that
all that makes my fathers consent to
my marrying her only a greater proof
of her evident goodness and charm

  then he did consent to your marry-
ing her trant interjected

  yes two weeks ago i had begged
and begged her but she never had been
willing to give me her promise a week
ago last wednesday after she had
known for more than a week that
father had agreed to it she finally con-
sented-but only conditionally i was
going away for a short business trip
and eva told me that she wanted that
much time to think it over but that
when i came back she would tell me
all about herself and if i still wanted
to marry her after hearing it she would
marry me i never imagined that any
one could force her to change her
mind

  yet she did change lier mind you
think put in trant

  without question mr trant was
the emphatic reply and it seems to
have been wholly because of the visit
of the hammering man who came to
see her at the office the day after i left
chicago it sounds queer to call him
that but i do not know his name nor
anything about him except the fact of
his hammering

  but if the people in the office saw
him you have at least his description
said trant

  they say he was unusually large
gross almost bestial in appearance and
red-headed he was plainly dressed
he asked to see eva when she caught
sight of him she turned back and re-
fused to speak with him

  how did the man take her refusal
was the next question

  he seemed very angry for a mo-
ment and then went out into the
public corridor replied edwards
for a long time he walked back and
forth in the corridor muttering to him-
self the people in the office had prac-
tically forgotten him when they were
startled by a noise of hammering or
pounding in the corridor one wall of
the inner office where eva had her
desk is formed by the wall of the cor-
ridor and the man was beating upon it
with his fists

 hammering excitedly asked
trant

  no in a rather deliberate and meas-
ured manner my father who heard
the sound says it was so very dis-
tinctive as to be recognizable if heard
again

  odd said trant and what ef-
fect did this have on miss silber
that is the strangest part of it eva
had seemed worried and troubled ever
since she learned the man was there
but this hammering seemed to agitate
and disturb her out of all reason at
the end of the days business she went
to my father and abruptly resigned the
position of trust she held with us my
father surprised and angry at her re-
fusal to give a reason for this action
accepted her resignation

 you do not happen to know
whether before this visit miss silber
had received any letter which troubled
her said trant

  she may have received a message
at her house but not at the office ad-
mitted the young man however
there is something still more mysteri-
ous on sunday my father sorry that

he had accepted her resignation so
promptly in view of our relationship
ordered the motor and went out to see
her but-good heavens

chapter ii

the anniversary

the loud rat-tat-tat of a cane had
shaken trants door and cracked
its ground glass from corner to corner
and the door was flung open to admit a
determined little man whose carefully
groomed pink-and-whiteness was ac-
centuated by his anger

  winton go home the elder ed-
wards glared sternly at his son and
then about the office mr trant-you
are mr trant i suppose-i want you
to have nothing to do with this matter
i prefer to let the whole affair drop
where it ife

  i reserve the right mr edwards
the psychologist said rising to take up
or drop cases only as i myself see fit
i have heard nothing yet in your sons
story to explain why you do not want
the case investigated

  then you shall have it explained
cuthbert edwards answered i called
on miss silber last sunday and it is
because of what i learned there that
i want winton to have nothing more
to do with her i went to miss silber
on sunday mr trant feeling that i
had been too hasty on thursday i of-
fered her an apology and was reasoning
with her when i heard suddenly in an
upper room the same noises that had
so disturbed the quiet of my office on
thursday afternoon

  you mean the hammering asked
trant

  precisely mr trant the hammer-
ing if you had heard that sound your-
self you would know that it is a very
definite and distinctive blow given ac-
cording to some intentional arrange-
ment i no sooner heard it and saw
the uneasiness it again caused in miss

silber than i became certain that the
same disreputable man wrho had been
to see her at my office was then housed
in her very home i insisted as she was
my sons promised wife on searching
the house

  did you find him trant inquired
sharply 

  no i did not mr trant though i
went into every room and opened every
closet i found only what appeared to
be the usual inmates of the house-
miss silbers father and the woman
who keeps house for her

  miss silbers father has miss sil-
ber a father trant interrupted

  he is hardly worth mentioning mr
trant the younger edwards ex-
plained he must have suffered at
some time from a brain trouble that
has partly deprived him of his faculties
i believe neither he nor the house-
keeper who is not in evas confidence
is likely to be able to help us in this
matter

  the man may have slipped out of
the house unseen suggested trant

  quite impossible cuthbert ed-
wards asserted miss silber lived in
a little house west of ravenswood
there are very few houses none
within at least a quarter of a mile of
her the ground is flat and no one
could have got away without being seen
by me

  your story so far is certainly very
peculiar the psychologist commented
and it gains interest with every detail
are you certain it was not this second
interview with your father-he turned
again to the younger man-that made
jmiss silber refuse you 

  no it was not when i got back
yesterday and learned from father what
had happened i went out at once to
eva at her home she had changed ut-
terly  not in her feelings toward me
for i felt certain even then that she
loved me-but an influence-the influ-
ence of this man-had come between
decidedly odd



us she told me there was no longer
any chance of her marrying she re-
fused the explanation she had prom-
ised to make to me she told me to go
away and forget her or-as i wrote you
-to think of her as dead

  you can imagine my feelings he
went on i could not sleep last night
after i had left her as i was wander-
ing about the house i saw the evening
paper lying spread out on the library
table and my eye caught her name in
it it was in the advertisement that i
sent you mr trant late as it was i
called up the newspaper offices and
learned the facts regarding its inser-
tion at daybreak i motored out to see
eva the house was empty i went
round it in the mud and rain peering
in at the windows even the house-
keeper was no longer there and the
neighbors could tell me nothing of the
time or manner of their leaving nor
has any word come from her to the
office

  that is all then the psychologist
said thoughtfully  the seventeenth
of the tenth  he reread the beginning
of the advertisement that is of
course a date the seventeenth of the
tenth month and it is put there to re-
call to miss silber some event of which
it would be sure to remind her i sup-
pose you know of no private sig-
nificance this date might have for her
or you would have mentioned it

  none on the seventeenth no mr
trant young edwards replied if
it were only the thirtieth i might help
you for i know that on that date eva
celebrates some sort of anniversary at
home

  trant opened a bulky almanac lying
on his desk and as he glanced swiftly
down the page his eyes flashed sud-
denly with comprehension

  you are correct i think as to the
influence of the hammering man on
her movements the psychologist said
but as to her connection with the man

and her reasons that is another matter
but of that i cannot say till i have had
half an hour to myself at the crerar
library

  the library mr trant cried
young edwards in surprise

 yes and as speed is certainly es-
sential i hope you still have your mo-
tor below

  as young edwards nodded the
psychologist seized his hat and gloves
and his instrument case and preceded
the others from the office half an
hour later he descended from the li-
brary to rejoin the edwardses waiting
in the motor

  the man who inserted that adver-
tisement-the hammering man i be-
lieve of whom we are in search he
announced briefly is named n meyan
and he is lodging or at least can be ad-
dressed at no  coy court the case
has suddenly developed far darker and
more villainous aspects even than i
feared please order the chauffeur to
go there as rapidly as possible

   coy court at which twenty minutes
later he bade young edwards stop the
motor proved to be one of those short
intersecting streets that start from the
crowded thoroughfare of halstead
street run a squalid block or two east
or west and stop short against the
sooty wall of a foundry or machine
shop no  the third house on
the left-like many of its neighbors
whose windows bore greek jewish or
lithuanian signs-was given up in the
basement to a store but the upper floors
were plainly devoted to lodgings

   the door was opened by a little girl
of eight does n meyan live here
the psychologist asked and is he in
then as the child nodded to the first
inquiry and shook her head at the sec-
ond when will he be back

   he comes to-night again sure she
said perhaps sooner but to-night
or to-morrow he goes away for good
he have paid only till to-morrow

  i was right you see in saying we
had need for haste trant said to
young edwards but there is one
thing we can try even though he is not
here let me have the picture you
showed me this morning

  he took from wintons hand the pic-
ture of eva silber opened the leather
case and held it so the child could see
do you know that lady

  yes the child showed sudden in-
terest it is mr meyans wife

  his wife cried young edwards
so the psychologist said swiftly
to the little girl you have seen this
lady here

  she comes last night the child
had grown suddenly loquacious be-
cause she is coming mr meyan makes
trouble that we should get aroom ready
for her already she has sent her
things and we get ready the room
next to his but because she wants
still another room she goes away last
night again rooms come not so easy
here we have many people but now
we have another so to-night she is com-
ing again

  does it now seem necessary for us
to press this investigation further
cuthbert edwards asked caustically
as he spoke the sound of measured
heavy blows came to them down the
dark stair apparently from the second
floor of the building the elder ed-
wards cried excitedly and triumphantly
what is that listen that man-
meyan if it is meyan-must be here
for that is the same hammering

  this is even better luck than we
could have expected exclaimed the
psychologist and he slipped past the
child and sped swiftly up the stairs
with his companions closely following
at the head of the flight he passed a
stunted woman whose marked resem-
blance to the little girl below estab-
lished her at once as mother and land-
lady and a trembling old man with

the elder edwards trant tore open
door after door of the rooms upon
that floor and the floor above before
the woman could prevent him the
rooms were all empty

  meyan must have escaped said
cuthbert edwards as they returned
crestfallen to the second story but
we have proof at least that the child
spoke the truth in saying miss silber
had been here to see him for she
hardly would have allowed her father
to come here without her

  her father-so this is miss silbers
father trant swiftly turned to ex-
amine with the keenest interest the old
man who shrank back shivering and
shuddering in a corner even in that
darkened hall he conveyed to the psy-
chologist an impression of hoary white-
ness his hair and beard were snowy
white the dead pallor of his skin was
the unhealthy whiteness of potato
shoots that have sprouted in a cellar
and the iris pf his eyes had faded until
it was almost indistinguishable yet
there remained something in the mans
appearance which told trant that he
was not really old-that he still should
be moving daring self-confident a
leader among men instead of cringing
and shrinking thus at the slightest move
of these chance visitors

  meyan is it because you are look-
ing for meyan that you have made all
this disturbance the woman broke in
then why didnt you ask for now
he is at the saloon i think only across
the street

  then we will go there at once said
trant but i will ask you-he turned
to the elder edwards-to wait for us
at the motor for two of us will be
enough for my purpose and more than
two may defeat it by alarming meyan
trant descended the stairs took his
instrument case from the motor and
with young edwards crossed the street
quickly to the saloon
decidedly odd



chapter iii

the clever pencil

a dozen idlers leaned against the
bar or sat in chairs tilted against
the wall trant examined these idlers
one after another closely the only
man at whom he did not seem to look
was one who as the only red-headed
man in the place must plainly be
meyan red-headed was the only de-
scription they had of him but meager
as it was with the landladys statement
that he was in the saloon trant re-
solved to test him

  the psychologist took an envelope
from his pocket and wrote rapidly upon
the back of it i am going to try some-
thing he whispered a he flicked the
envelope along the bar to edwards
it may not succeed but if i am able
to get meyan into a test then go into
that back room and speak aloud what i
have written on the envelope as if you
had just come in with somebody
then as edwards nodded his com-
prehension the psychologist turned
easily to the man nearest him at the
bar-a pallid lithuanian sweatshop
worker

  i suppose you can stand a lot of
that trant nodded at the glass of
pungent whisky still-it has its ef-
fect on you sends your heart action
up-quickens your pulse

  what are you asked the man
grinning temperance lecturer
something like that the psychol-
ogist answered at least i can show
you the effect whisky has upon your
heart

  he picked up the instrument case
and opened it the loungers gathered
about him and trant saw with satisfac-
tion that they thought him an itinerant
temperance advocate they stared curi-
ously at the instrument he had taken
from its case

  it goes on the arm-he explained
the lithuanian with a grin toward his
a

companions began to turn up his sleeve
not you trant said you just had a
drink

  is there a drink in this i aint had
a drink since breakfast said another
who pushed up to the table and bared
his blue-veined forearm for trant to
fasten the instrument to it

  young winton edwards watching
as curiously as the others saw trant
fasten the sphygmograph on the me-
chanics arm and the pencil point com-
mence to trace on the sooty surface a
wavy line the normal record of the
mechanics pulse

  you see it trant pointed out to
the others the record as it unwound
slowly from the drum every thought
you have every feeling every sensa-
tion-taste touch smell-changes the
beating of your heart and shows upon
this little record i could show through
that whether you had a secret you were
trying to conceal as readily as i will
show the effect whisky has on you or
as i can learti whether this man likes
the smell of onion he took from
the free lunch on the bar a slice of
onion which he held under the mans
nose ah you dont like onion but
the whisky will make you forget its
smell i suspect

  as the odor of the whisky reached
the mans nostrils the record line-
which when he smelled the onion had
become suddenly flattened with eleva-
tions nearer together as the pulse beat
weakly but more quickly-began to re-
turn to the shape it had had at first
he tossed off the liquor rolling it upon
his tongue and all saw the record re-
gain its first appearance then as the
stimulant began to take effect the pen-
cil point lifted higher at each rise and
the elevations became farther apart
they stared and laughed

  whisky effects you about normally
i should say trant began to unfasten
the sphygmograph from the mans
wrist i have heard it said that black-


top-notch magazine

haired men like you feel its effect least
of all light-haired men more men with
red hair like mine feel the greatest ef-
fect its said we red-haired men have
to be careful with whisky

  hey theres a red-headed man
one of the crowd cried suddenly point-
ing try it on him

  two enthusiasts at once broke from
the group and rushed eagerly to meyan
he had continued inattentive through
all to read his newspaper but now he
laid it down trant and young ed-
wards as he rose and slouched half
curiously toward them could see plainly
for the first time his strongly boned
coarsely powerful face and heavy-
lidded eyes and the grossly muscular
strength of his big-framed body

  pai your watered whisky he
jeered in a strangely thick and heavy
voice when the test had been explained
to him i am used to stronger drinks
he grinned derisively at the sur-
rounding faces kicked a chair up to the
table and sat down trant glanced
toward edwards and edwards moved
silently back from the group and dis-
appeared unnoticed through the parti-
tion door then the psychologist
swiftly adjusted the sphygmograph
upon the outstretched arm and wdtched
intently an instant until the pencil point
had caught up the strong and even pulse
which set it rising and falling in perfect
rhythm

  as he turned to the bar for the
whisky the rear door slammed and the
voice trant was expecting spoke yes
it was at warsaw the police took him
he was taken without warning from
his friends house what next the
prisons are full but they keep on filling
them  the graveyards will be full next
look  look cried the lithuanian
beside trant at the table he bragged
about watered whisky but just the sight
of it makes his heart beat bigger and
stronger

  trant bent eagerly over the smoked

paper watching the stronger slower
pulse beat which the record showed

  yes before he takes the whisky
his pulse is strengthened trant an-
swered  for that is how the pulse acts
when a man is pleased and exults

  he waited now almost inattentively
while meyan drank the whisky and the
others grew silent in defeat as the
giants pulse true to his boast showed
almost no variation under the fiery
liquor

  pah such child foolishness
meyan with steady hand set the glass
back on the table then as trant un-
clasped the straps around his arm he
rose yawned in their faces and lounged
out of the place

  the psychologist turned to meet
young edwards as he hurried in and
together they went out to join the father
at the motor

  we can do nothing sooner than to-
night trant said shortly an ex-
pression of keen anxiety on his face
i must learn more about this man but
my inquiries must be conducted alone
if you will meet me here again at seven
oclock to-night say at the pawnbro-
kers shop we passed upon the corner i
hope to be able to solve the mystery of
the hammering man and the influence
he is undoubtedly exerting on miss sil-
ber i may say he added after a mo-
ment that i would not attach too much
weight to the childs statement that miss
silber is meyans wife it is under-
stood then that you will meet me here
to-night as i have suggested

  he nodded to his clients and ran to
catch a passing street car

chapter iv

with nerves op steel

dromptly at seven oclock in ac-
cordance with trants directions
young winton edwards and his father
entered the pawnshop and started nego-
tiations for a loan almost immediately
decidedly odd



after they arrived there trant joined
them still carrying in his hand his in-
strument case the boy and his father
closed their negotiations and went out
with trant into the street they saw
then to their surprise that the psy-
chologist was not alone two men
were awaiting them each of whom car-
ried a case like trants the elder of
the two a man between fifty and sixty
years old met young edwards stare
with a benignant glance of his pale
blue eyes through an immense pair of
gold spectacles the other was young
pale broad-browed with an intelligent
face and his gaze was fixed in a look
of dreamy contemplation they were
dressed as mechanics but their gen-
eral appearance was not that of work-
men

  the door of meyans lodging house
was opened to them by the landlady
she led the way to the second floor
but paused to show a room to trant

  that is meyans room trant ex-
plained we will wait for him over
here he followed the woman into a
small and stuffy bedroom on the other
side of the hall we had better not
speak while we are waiting and-we
had better wait in the dark

  in the strange stuffy darkened little
room the five sat in silence footsteps
passed often in the street outside and
twice some one went through the hall
a half hour they waited thus then a
heavier footstep warned them of
meyans coming a minute later the
front door opened again and admitted
-as trant felt from the effect of the
first tone which reached the man wait-
ing at his side-eva silber after sev-
eral minutes trant turned up the light
and motioned to the two strangers who
had come with him they immediately
rose and left the room

  i am going to submit you both to a
very trying ordeal trant said to his
clients in a tone so low it could not

reach the hallway and it will require
great self-control on your part within
five or i hope at most ten minutes
i am going to show you into meyans
room where you will find among other
persons meyan himself and miss sil-
ber i want you to promise that neither
of you will attempt to question or to
speak to miss silber until i give you
leave otherwise i cannot allow you
to go in there and i have my own rea-
sons for wanting you to be present

  if it is essential mr trant-

the elder edwards said

  trant looked at the young man who
nodded

  thank you said the psychologist
and he went out and closed the door
upon them

  fully a quarter of an hour had
passed in spite of trants promise to
summon them in ten minutes before the
psychologist again opened the door and
ushered them into the room they already
knew as meyans

  the long table in the center of the
room had been cleared and behind it
three men sat in a row two of these
were the strangers who had come with
trant and the cases they had carried
together with the one trant himself had
brought stood open under the table
the man who sat between these two
was meyan near the table stood miss
silber

  at sight of her winton- edwards
made one swift step forward before he
recollected the promise he had made
and checked himself eva silber had
grown pale as death she stood now
with small hands clenched tight against
her breast staring into the face of the
young american she loved trant
closed the door and locked it

  we can begin now i think he said

  he stooped at once over the instru-
ment cases and brought out from them
three folding screens about eighteen
inches square when extended which he

set on the table-one in front of each
of the three men at the bottom of
each screen was a circular hole just
large enough for a mans arm to go
through and at trants command the
men put their arms through them
stooping again swiftly over the instru-
ment cases trant took out three sphyg-
mographs

  he rapidly adjusted these on the
arms of the three men and set in mo-
tion the revolving drums against which
the pencil points traced their wavy
lnes on smoked paper his clients
leaning forward in their interest could
then understand the purpose of the
screens which were designed to hide
the pitilessly exact records from the
three men

  for several minutes trant allowed
the instruments to run quietly until the
men had recovered from the nervous-
ness caused by the beginning of the
test

  i am going to ask miss silber to
tell you now as briefly as she can he
said after a pause the circumstances
of her fathers connection with the rus-
sian revolution which brought him to
the state you have seen and the rea-
sons why she has left you to go with
this man to russia

  to russia broke from winton
edwards

  to russia yes the girls pale
cheeks glowed you have seen my
father what he is what they have made
of him and you did not know he was a
russian you have seen him as he is
let me tell you-you who wear
proudly the badge of your revolution
fought in seven short years by your
great-grandfathers-what my father
was

  before i was born-it was in the
year -my father was a student in
moscow he had married my mother
the year before the czar finding that
even the teachings he had been advised
to permit made people dangerous closed

the universities father and his fellow
students protested they were impris-
oned and they kept my father who
had led the protest so long that i was
three years old before he saw his home
again

  but suffering and prison could not
frighten him in zurich before he
went to moscow he had been trained
for a doctor and seeing how power-
less the protest of the students had
been he determined to go among the
people so he made himself a medical
missionary to the poorest the most op-
pressed the most miserable and
wherever he was called to carry a cure
for disease he carried too a word of
hope of courage of protest a cry for
freedom

  late one night in a terrible snow- 
storm she went on just twenty years
ago a peasant brought to our door a
note unsigned for the sake of safety it
seemed telling father that an escaped
political prisoner was dying of exposure
and starvation in a hut on a deserted
farm ten miles from the town my fa-
ther hurried to his horse and set out
with food and fagots and by morning
through the cold and deep snow he
reached the place

  there he found a man apparently
freezing to death and fed and warmed
him said the girl and when the fel-
low was able to tell his pitiful tale
father boldly encouraged him told him
of the organization of protest he was
forming and asked him to join little
by little father told him all he had done
and all his plans at nightfall father
said farewell and turned to the door
where he found himself facing a spy
who held a pistol at his head in the
fight that followed father was able
only to wound the other upon the chest
with the blunt knife they had used to
cut their food before the spy called a
second confederate down from the loft
and father was overcome

  on the information of these police
decidedly odd



spies without trial of any sort-fa-
thers friends could discover only that
the name of his betrayer was valerian
urth-father was sentenced to solitary
confinement in an underground cell for
life and my mother-because she sent
food and fagots to a supposed convict
-was exiled to siberia ten years
ago her sister who took me received
word that she died on the convict island
of sakhalin but my father-she
gasped for breath-lived at least

  she stopped as suddenly as she had
begun trant who had stooped to
watch his records more closely when
the name of the police spy was men-
tioned still kept his gaze steadfastly
upon his instruments suddenly he mo-
tioned to the girl to complete her nar-
rative

  some years ago she said when
i was eighteen i left my mothers sis-
ter and went back to my fathers
friends such of them as were still
free she continued many who had
worked with him for the organization
had been caught or betrayed but
others and more had come in their
places and they had work for me i
might move about with less suspicion
than a man so i helped prepare for
the strikes which at last so terrified the
czar that on the thirtieth of october he
issued his manifesto to free those in
prison i had helped to free my father
with the rest i took him to hungary
and left him with friends while i came
here now do you not understand why
i am going back  she turned in piti-
ful appeal to young edwards it is
because there is work again in russia
for me to do

  she checked herself again and turned
to trant to see if he would force her
still to proceed but he was facing in-
tently as if fascinated the strange ham-
mering man and his two stranger com-
panions  yet he was not watching their
faces or their figures at all his eyes
followed the little pencil points which

before each of the three continually
traced their lines of record then he
took quickly from his pocket a folded
paper yellow with age worn creased
and pierced with pin marks in the
sight of all he unfolded it swiftly- upon
the table before the three refolded it
and put it back into his pocket and
though at sight of it no face changed
among the three even trants clients
could see how one line now suddenly
grew flat with low elevations irregular
and far apart as the pencil point
seemed almost to stop its motion over
the smoked paper ofnthe man in the
middle meyan

  that is all said trant in a tone
of assured triumph as he unstrapped
the sphygmographs from their wrists
you can speak now mr edwards
eva cried winton edwards in
wrild appeal you are not marriefi to
this man 

  married no the girl exclaimed
in horror until last thursday when
he came to the office i never saw him
but he has come to call me for the
cause which must be to me higher and
holier than love i must leave my love
for the cause of russia i must go and
nurse our soldiers on the battlefield i
have been promised a full pardon if i
will do so

  meyan now with a heavy slouch of
his muscular body left his two com-
panions at the table and moved up be-
side the girl have any more of you
anything to say to her before she goes
back with me to russia 

  to her no trant replied but
to you-and to these gentlemen-he
motioned to the two who had sat at the
table with meyan-i have to announce
the result of my test for wfiich they
are waiting this elder gentleman is
ivan munikov who was forced to
leave russia eight years ago because
his pamphlet on inalienable rights had
incurred the displeasure of the police
this younger man is dmitri vasili who


top-notch magazine

was exiled to siberia for political of-
fenses at thirteen years of age but
escaped to america they both are
members of the russian revolutionary
organization in chicago

  but the test-the test cried vasili
the test-the psychologist turned
sternly to face meyan-has shown as
conclusively and irrefutably as i could
hope that this man is not the revolu-
tionist he claims to be but is as we
suspected might be the case an agent
of the russian secret police and not
only that it has shown just as truly
though this fact was at first wholly un-
suspected by me that he-this agent of
police who would have betrayed the
daughter now and taken her back to
russia to be punished for her share in
the previous agitation-is the same
agent who twenty years ago betrayed
the father herman silber into impris-
onment true name from false i do
not know but this man who calls him-
self meyan now called himself then
valerian urth

  valerian urth eva silber cried
staggering back into winton edwards
arms

  but meyan made a disdainful ges-
ture with his huge fat hands bah
you would try to prove such things by
your foolish test

  then you will not refuse of
course trant demanded sternly to
show us if there is a knife scar on your
chest

  even as meyan would have repeated
his denial vasili and munikov leaped
from the rear of the room and tore his
shirt from his breast the psychologist
rubbed and beat the skin and the blood
rose to the surface revealing the thin
line of an almost invisible and time-
effaced scar

  our case is proved i think the
psychologist turned from the two who
stared with hate at the cringing spy and
again faced his clients

  he unlocked the door and handed

the key to munikov then picking up
his instrument cases and record sheets
with miss silber and his clients he left
the room and entered the landladys sit-
ting room

chapter v

an intrusion of science

vvfhen i received mr edwards let-
ter this morning trant said in
answer to the questions that showered
upon him it was clear to me at once
that the advertisement he inclosed de-
pended for its appeal on reminding eva
silber of some event of prime im-
portance to herself but also from the
wording employed of popular or na-
tional significance as well you further
told me that october th was a spe-
cial holiday with miss silber that i
found to be the date of the czars
manifesto of freedom and declaration
of amnesty to political prisoners at
once it flashed upon me eva silber
was a russian the difference between
the seventeenth given in the advertise-
ments and the thirtieth-thirteen days-
is just the present difference between
the old-style calendar used in russia
and ours

  before going to the crerar library
then it was clear that we had to do
with a russian revolutionary intrigue
he went on at the library i obtained
the key to the cipher and translated the
advertisement obtaining the name of
meyan and his address and also the
name and address of dmitri vasili a
well-known revolutionary writer to
my surprise vasili knew nothing of any
revolutionist named meyan it was in-
conceivable that a revolutionary emis-
sary should come to chicago and he not
know of it it became necessary to
find meyan immediately

  my first direct clew was the ham-
mering that we heard in this house it
was too much to suppose that in two
separate instances this hammering
decidedly odd



should be heard and in each case evas
father be present and no other discov-
erable agent and that still he should
have nothing to do with it obviously
it must have been herman silber who
did the hammering at evas home and
here in this house it was obvious too
that herman silber was the your own
of the advertisement

  to test meyan whom we found in
the saloon was not difficult said
trant i arranged to have him over-
hear some one speaking of an arrest at
warsaw which would at once suggest
itself as a hotbed of russian revolu-
tionists to either a revolutionist orv a
police agent but the idea would cer-
tainly give positive and very opposite
reactions if the man were a true revolu-
tionist or if he were a spy meyans
pulse so strengthened and slowed-as
under a pleasurable stimulus-that i
felt i had received confirmation of my
suspicions though i had not then the in-
formation which would enable me to
expose the man to secure this i
sought out dmitri vasili he intro-
duced me to munikov who had been a
friend of silber before his imprison-
ment and between them i got the his-
tory of herman silber and his
daughter

  i explained to munikov and vasili
that the methods of the psychological
laboratory would be as efficacious in
picking out a spy among true men as 
have many times proved them to be in
convicting the criminal

  every emotion reacts upon the
pulse which strengthens in joy and
weakens in sorrow changes with anger
and with despair and as every slightest
variation it undergoes can be detected
and registered by the sphygmograph-i
felt certain that if i could test the three
men together by having miss silber tell
her fathers story aloud i could deter-
mine conclusively by comparison of the
records of the two true revolutionists
with that of meyan whether his sym-

pathies were really with the revolution-
ist party i arranged with munikov
and vasili to come here with me to-
night and after meyan had arrived
they left us here and went to him as
representatives of the revolutionary
movement to ask his credentials

  when he could furnish none
trant went on they proposed and in
fact forced him into this test it is a
dangerous thing to endeavor to pass
oneself off as a revolutionist and it
was safer for him to submit to a test
than to have his mission frustrated by
incurring not only suspicion but pos-
sibly death completely ignorant of the
pitiless powers of psychological meth-
ods and confiding in his steely nerves
which undoubtedly have carried him
through many less searching ordeals he
agreed you saw how perfectly he was
able to control his face and every move-
ment of his body while the test went
on but you can see here-trant
spread out his strips of smoked paper
-on these records which i shall pre-
serve by passing them through a bath
of varnish how useless that self-con-
tror was since the sphygmogragh re-
corded by its moving pencil the hidden
feelings of his heart

  as i lay these side by side you can
see how consistently at each point in
the story munikov and vasili experi-
enced the same feelings but meyan had
feelings which were different i did
not dream of course when i started the
test that i would discover in meyan the
same man who had betrayed herman
silber it was only when at her first
mention of valerian urth i obtained
from meyan this startling and remark-
able record he pointed to a place
where the line suddenly had grown al-
most straight and flat that i realized
that if the man before me was not him-
self urth he at least had some close
and under the circumstances op-
pressive connection with him

  eva silber still had the note that


top-notch magazine

had been sent to summon her father on
the errand of mercy which had caused
his imprisonment she gave it to me
before you entered the room i was
certain that of all men in the world
there was but one who could recognize
or feel any emotion at sight of that yel-
lowed and time-worn paper and that
man was valerian urth who had used
it to betray herman silber

  i showed it to meyan and obtained
this really amazing reaction which ends
his record the psychologist pointed
to the record it assured me that
meyan and urth were one

  this is amazing mr trant cuth-
bert edwards said but you have left
unexplained the most perplexing fea-
ture of all-the hammering

  to communicate with one another
from their solitary cells russian pris-
oners long ago devised a code of
spelling letters by knocking upon the
wall-a code widely spread and known
by every revolutionist it is extremely
simple the letters of the alphabet-
trant took from his pocket a slip of pa-
per-are arranged in this manner

  he set down rapidly the alphabet
omitting two letters arranged in four
lines thus

          a b c d e f
          g h i k  m
          n o p r s t
          u v w x y z

  a letter is made the psychologist
explained but giving first the proper
number of knocks for the line a short
pause then knocks for the number of
the letter in the line for instance e is
one knock and then five y is four
knocks and then five

  by means of this code i translated
the figures in the advertisement and ob-
tained meyans name and address i
suppose he used it not only in the ad-
vertisement but at the office because
his long experience had taught him
that herman silber as many another
man condemned to the horrors of a

russian prison for a term of years had
probably lost the power of speech and
continued to communicate in freedom
by the means he had used for so many
years in prison

  wonderful mr trant wonderful
exclaimed cuthbert edwards i only
regret that we can do nothing to
meyan for there is no law i think by
which he can be punished

  the psychologists face darkened
vengeance is not ours he answered
simply but i have given the key of
meyans room to munikov 

  the elder edwards clearing his
throat moved over to eva and put his
arm about her as though to protect her
since you must see that you cannot
go back to russia my dear he said
awkwardly will you not let me wel-
come you now into your place in my
home

  and as the son sprang swiftly for-
ward and caught his fathers hand
trant took up his instrument cases un-
der his arm and went out alone into
the warm april night

a man came into a dog show one day

    chapter i

a girl a dog and a man

a hen miss elizabeth wiggin
settled herself comfortably in
the shade of the spreading
oak in libbys pasture she
looked forward eagerly to a
pleasant and quiet hour with her book
wooed won and wedded as may
be surmised from the title of the book
miss wiggin was romantic she was
likewise just eighteen years of age and
the daughter of judge nathan p wrig-
gin of greenbush the village that could
be seen nestling in the valley something
like a mile distant from that hillside
oak

  miss wiggin lived in greenbush but
on pleasant afternoons she had a habit
of wandering away accompanied only
by an aged shepherd dog in search of
some spot where she could read with-
out fear of interruption for her grim
old father objected to trashy love sto-
ries and her ascetic spinster aunt who
had acted as the judges housekeeper

since the death of mrs wiggin held
all such fiction in abhorrence

  indeed the animus of aunt sally
wiggin against stories depicting the rav-
ages wrought by the little god of the
bow and arrow was so extreme that by
consigning such terrible tales to the
flames whenever she found them about
the house she conscientiously did her
best to prevent them from turning the
head of her niece she even forbade
the village news dealer to sell bessie any
more books of that type

  in these days however it is no easy
matter to deprive any one of the mental
pabulum that is desired and aunt sally
had set herself a task that she could not
accomplish lemuel dodd judge wig-
gins hostler and man of all work red-
headed freckled and homely as a slump
fence undeterred by the discouraging
fact that his persistent efforts to make
love to bessie seemed merely to arouse
her amusement became her secret and
faithful ally twice a week at least he
spent twenty-five cents of his wages for
a paper-covered novel to be smuggled


top-notch magazine

into her possession and invariably he
chose the ones whose titles seemed to
promise that their contents would come
up to elizabeths requirements

  there aint many single fellers left
round this town lemuel told himself
and mebbe if she reads enough of them
yarns shell git so desprit shell have
to grab whats handy and when she
gits the notion to grab im going to take
keer that im the handiest thing in
reach

  and so on this sunny september aft-
ernoon bessie wiggin was seeking the
shade of the oak in libbys pasture pre-
sumably afar from interruption and
prepared thoroughly to enjoy lemuels
latest contribution her face was al-
most hidden by one of aunt sallys
extremely old-fashioned sunbonnets
which she had hastily taken when she
slipped out of the house with the book
sliep the old dog stretched himself in
the short grass at her feet and prepared
to go to sleep comfortably

  the view from this spot at a consid-
erable distance from the brown road
that wound ribbonlike down into the
village was pleasant to the eye but the
judges daughter lost no time in admir-
ing the scenery she was soon absorbed
in the pages of her novel

  so absorbed did she become that she
failed to hear the approaching steps of
am somewhat dusty and soiled but de-
cidedly good-looking young man in a
brown norfolk suit knee-length leather
leggings and a motoring cap he was
within a few yards of her when he
saw her and stopped	

  i beg your pardon madam he said
looking dowu upon the obscuring sun-
bonnet

  she uttered a little startled scream
and looked up her blue eyes wide her
red lips parted a glimpse of the pretty
and youthful face which the sunbonnet
had concealed caused the stranger to
catch his breath

  reginald exclaimed miss wiggin

beholding before her the living incarna-
tion of the hero of her book just as her
fancy had pictured him

  daphne  said the young man think-
ing of the mythological wood nymph

  woof barked the old dog awak-
ing and springing up as quickly as age
and rheumatism would allow

  the stranger backed round to the op-
posite side of the tree keep that beast
away from me please he begged in
evident apprehension

  with a swift sweep of one slender
hand miss wiggin thrust back the sun-
bonnet which held by the loosely
knotted ribbons hung suspended on her
shoulders exposing a mass of wavy
golden-brown hair at the same mo-
ment with remarkable agility and grace
she half rose and half turned on her
knees her right hand clasping the book
the fingers of her left hand lightly
touching the ground her gaze followed
the shrinking young man who was now
fearfully watching the ominously growl-
ing dog surely this was unexpected
and disappointing behavior for regi-
nald the brave who-in her novel-
had unhesitatingly faced the most
frightful perils for his lady fair

  made suspicious by the actions of the
stranger shep advanced bristling and
snapping as if contemplating instant
flight the young man gave one hasty
look around the nearest fence was
some six or eight rods away and it
did not promise to stop a ferocious and
angry dog in pursuit of a fleeing fugi-
tive and there was no other refuge in
sight

  keep that creature away wont
you again entreated the agitated man
placing the trunk of the tree between
himself and the animal i detest
dogs

  oh reginald sighed bessie wig-
gin in bitter disappointment

  oh hang it exploded the stranger
with shocking violence if i had a
shaming the

  shep charged barking violently he
meant to stop out of reach of the mans
feet in case he showed a disposition to
kick but making a great leap the
stranger clutched a stout lower limb of
the tree and swung himself up out of
the reach of harm with the most amaz-
ing celerity the dog snapping at his
heels as they receded skyward

  perched astride the limb with his feet
drawn up the refugee shook his fist at
the raging animal which inflamed by
success made another great jump into
the air and fell back on the ground his
age-enfeebled legs collapsing beneath
him

  still kneeling the girl burst into a
peal of laughter

romance justified

rjo to it said the exasperated man
 in the tree get in your laugh
while the laughings good if your
confounded dog had succeeded in chew-
ing some chunks out of me i suppose
youd simply have collapsed with mer-
riment

  oh dear  gasped miss wiggin try-
ing to suppress her mirth if you only
realized how ridiculous it is old shep
couldnt hurt a sick kitten

  huh grunted the stranger skep-
tically perhaps not but he certainly
showed a strong desire to plant a few
teeth in any part of my person that he
could reach

  miss wiggin continued to laugh it
would have to be a fezv teeth as hes
lost almost all that he ever had and hes
so old that hes half deaf and getting
blind thats why he didnt warn me
that you were coming if you hadnt
shown that you were scared hed never
have made an offer to touch you

 how was i to know that de-
manded the man on the limb flushing
on such short notice i couldnt tell
whether he was a senile and harmless

old dog or a young and savage one bent
on making a meal off my person

  youre an awful coward arent
you asked the girl rising to her feet
and regarding him with open contempt

  she was slender willowy and grace-
ful he considered that she was the
prettiest girl he had ever seen and he
wondered how even with the sunbonnet
hiding her face he had made the blun-
der of mistaking her for a middle-aged
woman he felt his heart thumping
queerly he also felt his face burning
beneath her unmasked disdain

let me explain he pleaded hastily
it isnt necessary she cut him short
i dont suppose there are any regi-
nalds to be found outside the pages of
fiction

  the daphnes he returned are
myths

  she tossed her head besides being
a fraid cat she retorted youre just
about the most impolite person i ever
met what were you doing prowling
around in this field anyhow 

  being in haste to secure a convey-
ance to albion for two gentlemen whose
motor has broken down back yonder on
the road i was making a short cut to
town and avoiding the most of the hill
the gentlemen must catch the three-
forty train at albion it is now he
stated balancing himself on the limb
and taking out his watch seven min-
utes past two

  and twenty-three miles to albion
your gentlemen will have to hurry
they may make it if i can get an
automobile in town

  again she laughed automobiles
arent popular in greenbush peter
beedy is the only citizen who owns one
hes been arrested and fined four times
for exceeding the speed limit of eight
miles an hour the last time that hap-
pened he was so mad he swore hed
never start the machine again and he
had it towed to his barn and stored
away


top-notch magazine

  thanks for the information me
for peter beedy he glanced down-
ward sitting on his haunches and gaz-
ing upward with a wistful eye shep
was licking his old chops if you will
be good enough to call your dog away
and keep a firm restraining hand upon
him ill hit the high spots between here
and mr beedys domicile

  as long as youre so completely lack-
ing in sand said she ill collar shep
and hold him until you get a fair start
but let me warn you that if you succeed
in getting beedys auto youll certainly
be pinched and fined if youre caught
driving faster than eight miles an hour
anywhere within the town limits

  its always necessary was his re-
tort first to catch your hare if
beedys bubble has any speed at all
somebody will be handed a laugh when
you give the word ill come down

  now it chanced that neither of them
had noticed the approach of libbys
bull confined in that same pasture the
bull was ugly and resentful of intru-
sion on its domain and just as the
girl placed one hand on the dogs collar
the bull charged with a snort and a
bellow the man on the limb shouted a
warning the girl screamed and dodged
behind the tree the dog seeing the
charging beast by accident bounded
lamely to meet him and the bull with
one sweep of his horns tossed the dog
fifteen feet into the air

  the man in the tree was paralyzed
with horror the disastrous attempt of
the dog to protect his mistress seemed
to check the charging bull for barely a
fraction of a second with glaring eyes
the beast came on dashing straight at
the terrified girl

 the fence shouted the man
run

  even as he uttered the words he real-
ized what would happen if she at-
tempted to obey the infuriated beast
would overtake her toss her with its
horns even as the old dog had been

tossed gjore her trample the life out of
her delicate body for the briefest frac-
tion of time he was sickened by the
thought then he dropped from the
tree directly in the path of the mad
creature as he dropped he snatched
the cap from his head the instant his
toes touched the turf he sprang to one
side the bull missed him by a foot
and he struck the animal across the eyes
with his cap

  it seemed like a feeble thing to do
but he had time for nothing else and he
hoped desperately to turn the attention
of the beast from the girl hoped some-
how by diverting the creatures fury
to himself to give her an opportunity
to flee to safety beyond the fence

  the girl had circled round the tree
keeping it between herself and the bull
as the man struck the animal the latter
swerved and turned with amazing
speed surprised perhaps by the ap-
pearance of a second human being on
the scene the stranger waved his arms
and shouted challengingly the animal
accepted the challenge promptly and
charged at him

  oh gasped miss wiggin hell
be-killed

  but almost with the agility of a
capeador the young man again leaped
aside at precisely the right moment to
foil the beast again he struck with his
cap but this time it was impaled on one
of the bulls horns and torn from his
hand

  without glancing round at the girl
he cried sharply commandingly  run
for the fence ill keep him busy till
you are safe

  bessie wiggin ran just as she was
ordered to do although she did not real-
ize what she was doing until she had
almost reached the fence too terrified
to look back she actually sailed over the
barrier almost as a frightened deer
might have done scarcely touching the
top rail falling safe on the far side
amid some bowlders and bushes where
shaming the speed limit



for a moment she lay panting and help-
less

  she was aroused by shep the faith-
ful old dog had not been killed limp-
ing and whining he had followed her
in her flight and dragged himself
through the fence still whining plain-
tively he was licking her face

  with a sobbing cry she seized the
fence and pulled herself to her feet
still baiting the bull the young man
was dodging round and round the tree
the enraged beast making every effort
to reach him he had kept his word
he had held the attention of the animal
while she escaped the handsome stran-
ger she had called a coward had taken
this dreadful risk for her

  realizing the danger he was in she
called to him wildly oh look out-
look out jump-quick run do
something

  he certainly was doing something in
fact he was an extremely busy person
just then again and again he appeared
to avoid the rushes of the bull barely
by a hairs breadth each time this
happened the girls heart seemed ready
to burst with terror it could not last
long the snorting bellowing beast
would get him at last a slight miscal-
culation the slightest slip and it would
all be over

  bessie wiggin grasped a stake of the
fence and tried desperately to tear it
loose intending to return to the assist-
ance of the stranger with this weapon
she was the coward after all she
had run away and left him to be killed

  then she saw him put over a bit
of strategy on the bull the animal
had paused for a moment and turned
slowly upon him pawing the ground
instead of placing the tree between him-
self and danger the man planted his
back against it his eyes never leaving
the beast for an instant

  waving his hands in gestures of dis-
dain he taunted the creature come
on old lumberheels wake up and

show a little pep throw into high
gear and give us some speed dont
quit now the funs just begun wake
up come on 

  the bull leaped forward like a hurri-
cane and just as the pale and horri-
fied girl expected to see the man impaled
to the tree he slipped deftly behind it
the head of the bull crashed against
the oak and the animal staggered as if
struck by a butchers maul

  the stranger laughed that ought
to give you a slight headache he said

  run cried the girl this way-
quick nows the time 

  dazed the bull was backing oflf
slowly shaking his head evidently the
man agreed with bessie that the moment
was propitious for he turned and raced
toward the fence but the animal had
not been injured nearly as much as one
might have supposed and seeing his
mocking foe in flight he plunged in
pursuit

  the stranger was fleet-footed but the
bull was a trifle fleeter just as the
runner gathered himself to take the
fence with one clean leap the beast
overtook him through the air sailed
the man propelled by the head and
horns of the bull as well as by the
spring of his own legs over the fence
in a great curve he came crashing head
downward amid the rocks and bushes

  when the young man opened his eyes
again he discovered that his head was
resting in the lap of miss bessie wig-
gin who sobbing hysterically was wip-
ing his forehead with a bloodstained
handkerchief

  he looked up at her and smiled
daphne he whispered

  reginald she cried

it never ran smooth

youre not killed are you she
sobbed trying to stanch the flow
of blood that trickled from a gash at
the edge of his hair near his temple

  if i am he returned with a feeble
effort to jest i dont know it yet
but youre hurt you struck on
your head

  probably that saved my life solid
ivory you know i will admit that i
feel a trifle upset so to speak no dont
move-please dont the mere thought
of your moving gives me pain

  but i must go for help youre
wounded

  i am he admitted gazing up into
her blue eyes in a manner that gave her
a most peculiar sensation mortally
wounded i fear i never was hit so
hard in my life and i am afraid i cant
recover

  again she cried out in apprehension
and distress oh i was afraid you
were done for when that beast caught
you

  i am was his singularly cheerful
acknowledgment im done for ive
got mine the jig is up with me

  is it your arms your legs your
ribs-are they smashed where do
you feel it most

  here he answered putting his
hand to his heart but it isnt my ribs
its something deeper daphne

that isnt my name its bessie 
bessie mines george awfully
commonplace isnt it now if my folks

had only called me reginald-

  you mustnt try to talk im sure
its painful you must keep still

  i will if youll keep on talking your-
self the sound of your voice soothes
me like the murmuring of a brook
your eyes are like springtime violets
the touch of your little hand is as de-
licious as a draft of pure water to a
person dying of thirst now ill leave
it to you if a reginald could beat that
speech much

  she stiffened and drew back a bit
the color beginning to return to her
pale cheeks they looked at each other
steadily and the returning flush covered
her face

  beyond the fence the victorious bull
pawed the ground frorrra vantage of
safety the old dog glared through the
rails and regarded the bull with disap-
proval but the man and girl paid no
attention to either of them the girl
had turned her gaze toward the distant
road that wound down into the village

  i dont believe you are hurt much
she said in a low voice which how-
ever was made unsteady by a queer lit-
tle throbbing in her throat if you
were you couldnt talk like that

  its because i am that i can talk like
that he declared its the first time
i ever talked that way to any one
your friends who have to get to
albion she murmured im afraid
theyll lose their train

  by jove he cried sitting up sud-
denly id clean forgotten them
you were fooling me she ex-
claimed as she started to rise

  with a groan he fell back the crim-
son oozing from his wound ran down
across his temple and in another mo-
ment she was again checking the flow
with her handkerchief his eyes were
closed and she imagined he had fainted

  oh dear she seemed distraught
i dont know what to do ive got
to get help but if i leave you you may
bleed to death

  dont let me bleed to death he
begged faintly dont leave me-bes-
sie you mustnt leave me-as long as
i live

  it seemed a great effort for him to
lift his eyelids but he looked at her
again and the appeal in his eyes filled
her with a feeling of desperation

  you must have a doctor

  youre the only doctor i want
youre the only doctor who can cure
me if you throw up the case and turn
me over to a common pill slinger ill
never get over it

  but ive simply got to get help for
you somehow ill hurry
shaming the speed limit



  i cant let you go im an awful

coward you know and-

  youre nothing of the sort ive
never seen anybody as brave as you
are

  a tremor ran over his body at first
she thought it was a convulsive move-
ment of pain but when it continued she
was overcome by the astounding convic-
tion that he was laughing astonish-
ment gave place to outraged indignation
there was no mistaking the fact that he
was really shaking with laughter that he
sought in vain to suppress she leaped
up letting him drop back and stood
rigid filled with intense resentment

  you-youre making sport of me
she said in a low voice that suddenly
had in it something like icy brittleness
youve been playing on my sympathy
youre not really hurt-much it was
a very gentlemanly thing to do  i hope
you have enjoyed yourself

  he sat up without much effort i
give you my word of honor that i
didnt mean to laugh at you perhaps
my head is affected a little this crack
on the bean must be the cause it really
was some bump

  you-you wretch she cried
stamping her foot i hate you

  her little hands were tightly clenched
she turned away to hide the tears which
welled again into her eyes but now
they were tears of exasperation shame
and rage

  he got quickly to his feet please
bessie he said you dont under-
stand not for the world would i-

  he stopped short staring across at
the road down which a touring car con-
taining two men was speeding toward
the village

  great caesar he cried there
goes the governor hitchens must have
got the engine running somehow
theyll expect to find me in town
with all the strength of a good pair
of lungs he shouted waving his hands
above his head the automobile sped

on its occupants neither saw nor
heard him

  i guess im left for the time being
he said theyll go ripping straight
through to catch that train at albion

  they wont rip through very far
miss wiggin flung at him theres a
trap just outside the village watched
by a deputy sheriff and two constables
your old governor will be nabbed and
pulled up before my father who will
soak him with a fine and i hope dad
soaks him good she finished laughing
and doing so with a vindictiveness that
seemed to afford her untold relief and
satisfaction

the trappers

eremiah small constable of the
j town of greenbush sat on the top
rail of the roadside fence and wedged
a load of fine cut into the bowl of a
burned blackened odorous corncob
pipe packing it down with a decidedly
dirty thumb from his perch he could
look over the top of a cluster of low
sumacs and keep watch upon a point
on the hillside where the highway
wound into view he could also see
somewhat nearer a tall and lonely elm
tree past which the road ran in a
broadside curve

  weeping buzzell another con-
stable was sitting on the ground in the
shade of the sumacs leaning against the
fence and occasionally wiping his red-
rimmed and watery eyes with a faded
and mussed bandanna handkerchief
his jaws worked wearily at a quid of
tobacco the presence of which was
further advertised by the unmistakable
stains at the corners of his doleful and
flabby mouth he had chosen his lowly
position for comfort and because his
companion was far better adapted to
the task of outlook

  i tell you miah sniffed buzzell
this here job is jest about played out

a dollar-sixty a day aint no livin pay
for a hard-workin man and thats all
we git outside commissions on the fines
the jedge imposes and the deputty
sheruff gits the biggest whack at them
we have to be pacified with what comes
outer the little end o the horn yis-
tidday my share was thutty-two cents
and so fur to-day we aint nabbed
only one motor-cycle feller who come
through by accident havin got off the
road to darpascus im gittin discour-
aged

  constable small made a final poke at
the pipe bowl and glanced down at the
complaining individual never knowed
you to tackle any job that you didnt
git discouraged over in a short time
silas he averred contemptuously
gittin discouraged is your long suit
youve been discouraged all your life

  buzzell moved his slouching shoul-
ders resentfully mebbe thats so
miah but i aint never had no luck
like some folks when i was swore in
as constable and put on this job there
was an avrage of eighteen or twenty
merchines a day that went through town
regardless of speed regerlations busi-
ness was lively and i sorter guessed my
luck had turned but now them there
automobile fellers has got wise and sent
out warnins and posted notices in all
the garrages round about cautionin
folks to keep away from greenbush
and theyre goin round by the way of
damascus or cherryfield and leavin us
to twiddle our thumbs my opinion
its hurt the town too greenbush is
deadern a salted herrin

  small lifted a broganed foot and
struck a match on the leg of his trou-
sers after which he held it up until his
wheezing pipe was lit

  better not go makin that kind of
talk in the hearin of jedge wiggin he
warned pulling hard at the rebellious
corncob if you done so hed tell you
what in a hurry and youd lose your
badge so quick itd make your head

swim you know him silas he aint
got no use for automobiles nohow and
when he announced that he perposed
to enforce the speed regerlations with-
out fear or favor he sartainly meant it
hed slap a fine ojnter the president of
the united states if he was to go scoot-
in through town fastern the speed limit
allows

  mebbe he would said buzzell
hes so hard-headed and sot it would
be just like him jest because hes
alwus been a hoss owner and a hoss-
man hes down on automobiles in gen-
ral and evrybody that has anything to
do with em i reckon thats why he
wants to be representative to the iegis-
latoor he wants to go there to put
through some kind of a bill to restrict
the use of them merchines to certain
roads so that the drivers of hosses can
have the other roads to themselves
thats jest how old-fashioned the jedge
is

  lemme tell you somethin silas
said constable small taking his pipe
from between his teeth and striking an
impressive attitude with it they bet-
ter let him go if the jedge dont git
the nomination from this deestrict hell
upset their apple cart as sure as preach-
in therell be three candidates in the
primaries and the party dont want
rufe crockett for hes a windbag a
turncoat and a flopper and hed be
beat at the polls just as he was four
year ago on the ticket of tother party
but if jedge wiggin cant win ill bet
you a twenty-cent plug of war hoss
he turns his strength aginst ephraim
glover of palmyra and throws the
nomination to crockett this deestrict
is the keystone and if the party loses it
theyll most likely lose the whole county
i understand the governor himself is
ruther fretted over the situation with
the primaries cornin on next week

  i dont keer much about politics
nohow declared buzzell wiping his
eyes again one partys bad as tother
shaming the speed limit



and there aint neither of em done noth-
ing for me still i spose im expected
to vote for the jedge jest because i hap-
pened to be the most capable man they
could find for this job nobody else i
know of wanted it i took it because it
promised to be a purty good thing not
because im particler agin automobil-
ists im goin to tell you my private
idee i think nathan wiggins turned
greenbush into a graveyard by finin
evrybody ketched goin fastern eight
miles in the town limits hes give the
place a black eye and set people to
dodgin it he aint progressive thats
all i got to say

  and if youve got any sense left in
your noodle you wont go round kow-
wowing that kind of talk if you did

- hey by gowdy here comes

a bubble over the hill git up git
out your ticker and ketch him when he
passes the big elum hes hittin it up
like a streak of greased quicksilver
there was immediate action in the
shade of the sumacs with a sniffling
grunt which- held something both of
protest and eagerness weeping buzzell
heaved himself to his feet fishing for
his watch on the fence jeremiah
small already had his timepiece in hand
his snaggy teeth gripped the pipestem
his leathery face expressed the rapacity
of the still hunter who has sighted game

  ready now  he cried ketch him
when i give the word now

  down the winding road shot the au-
tomobile jtrailing a cloud of dust be-
hind it besides the driver a smooth-
faced bespectacled man of thirty it
contained only one person a stout
florid worried-looking individual in the
middle years of life

  careful hitchens warned the lat-
ter as the man at the wheel made a
turn that barely prevented them from
taking to the ditch you know youre
not used to driving dont pile us up
dont worry sir returned the
driver reassuringly you know youve
ca

got to catch that train if youre going
to get to your office for the conference
with the chairman of the state com-
mittee youll have to talk with old
wiggin over the phone no time to
stop in greenbush and chin with him
now

  weve got to pick up the boy in
town he must have got there twenty
minutes ago were liable to meet him
starting out after me with a hired car
keep your eyes peeled

  around another curve careened the
car and struck the straight gentle in-
cline running dowtn into the village out
from behind the sumacs dashed the con-
stables jeremiah small planting him-
self in the very center of the highway
one hand upflung authoritatively while
the other flipped back his coat and re-
vealed the badge pinned to his left sus-
pender silas buzzell backed him up
but with a shade more discretion about
blocking the path of the speeding motor
car

  stop shouted constable small
in the name of the law i command
you

  hold up wheezed constable buz-
zell stop right where ye be

  pinched exclaimed the driver in
disgust and consternation

  dont stop go on rasped the
florid-faced man at his side then he
lifted himself above the glass wind
shield flung up his gloved hands and
roared clear the road you idiots
out of the way  get out

  seeing the automobile whizzing
straight at him without slackening speed
to any perceptible degree jeremiah
small cast his dignity to the winds and
made a leap for safety weeping buz-
zell backed off the shoulder of the road
caught his heel and sat down amid the
dusty grass of the shallow ditch the
car swished past the stout man relaxing
on the seat and tore on its way

  thatll cost ye ten dollars more for
defyin the majesty of the law splut-

tered small shutting his eyes to prevent
them from being filled with the blinding
cloud of dust flung over both officers
the jedge ahvus tucks on an addi-
tional ten for that trick go it you gay
birds the faster you drive the higher
ygull bounce when yon hit the bumps
come on silas deputty newberryll
have that gay pair collared in two
shakes of a lambs tail

  if the defiant autoists fancied they
were to escape the clutches of the speed
regulators in that easy manner they
soon realized their error farther on
toward the village running the full
width of the road were a series of art-
fully arranged ridges and hollows cal-
culated to give a severe shaking up to
the passengers of any motor car pro-
ceeding at a speed exceeding four or
five miles an hour

  when this particular car struck those
speed-killers the two occupants were
shot into the air with great violence
coming down the car seemed to meet
them coming up and the second and
third bounces were worse than the first
indeed it was little short of remark-
able that the florid-faced passenger suc-
ceeded in staying in the car at all the
driver clinging desperately to the wheel
had a better chance although he found
it extremely difficult and ahead of
them the road undulated for a distance
of several rods like miniature waves of
the sea

 ugh woogh woosh splut-
tered the older man clutching wildly
at the bucking car what-in-hali-

  hitchens struggled to obey finally
succeeding in throwing the clutch and
jamming on the brake the wheels
locked slid with a grinding sound that
meant money in the pocket of some tire
manufacturer the car bobbed and hob-
bled over the ragged places and the
pursuing cloud of dust swooped down
over them when the dust settled a

little and they could catch their breath
again they beheld a formidable satis-
fied-looking man calmly mounting the
right-hand running board

had boarded them and you are took

the driver bristled with indignation

     its an outrage he cried we
must get to albion in time to catch the
three-forty train you cant stop us
ive stopped ye already said dep-
uty sheriff newberry serenely un-
der the circumstances it dont become
you to tell me what i cant do youll
be permitted to proceed on your way
to albion after jedge wiggin attends
to your case so you might as well
soople down and take it calm

  but you dont understand you dont
know who youre holding up in this
high-handed fashion you are inter-
fering with-

man giving a glance at his watch
never mind telling him who we are
 taint necessary stated new-
berry youll have to tell the jedge
anyhow

  how long asked the man with the
watch will it require to get through
with this business so that we may go
on it is most important that we should
get that train

  wull drawled the deputy if the
jedge is around handy and he dont
read you too long a lecture before he
slaps on the fine mebbe youll git
started agin in half or three-quarters
of an hour taint likely to be moren
an hour anyhow

  half an hour will make us miss the
train cant we fix it with you

  now take keer take keer dont
you go for to offer no bribes to an
officer of the law i couldnt take
them nohow he added as constable
small came hurrying up with constable
buzzell wheezing and sniffling at his
heels

  but protested hitchens if you
knew who-

  never mind that interrupted the
older man sharply the other busi-
ness will have to wait i have a curi-
osity to see just how judge wiggin
handles cases of this sort

  your curosity assured deputy
sheriff newberry swinging open the
tonneau door will be satisfied git
in boys

  when the three men had all piled into
the rear of the car the one in command
directed hitchens to drive straight down
the long main street of the town and
proceeded slowly

  their appearance in the village was
the signal for various inhabitants who
observed them to grin and wag their
heads making uncomplimentary and de-
risive remarks while a number of small
boys hooting and laughing assembled
and followed the car as far as turners
grocery over which in a bare and
sparsely furnished room judge wiggin
dispensed justice by mulcting the un-
fortunate speeders who were arraigned
before him a number of idle citi-
zens who had been gossiping and- swap-
ping stories on the store steps rose at
once and followed the prisoners con-
ducted by newberry and buzzell up
the narrow back stairs to the court-
room jeremiah small had been sent
to fetch the judge

  the automobilists were given chairs
facing a table which served as a desk
and an anaemic-looking young man in
horn-rimmed spectacles seated himself
at the table and began making out the
complaint having first questioned buz-
zell about the speed which the offenders

had been making when they ran into
the trap

  your name inquired the clerk
turning to the older man

  put down john doe said the lat-
ter and richard roe he added nod-
ding toward his companion i am the
owner of the car richard was driving
when we were held up

  the younger man gave him a queer
look and leaned closer whispering
something behind his hand the answer
was a grim smile and a shake of the
head after slight hesitation the clerk
wrote down the names as given

  the sound of heavy steps on the
stairs preceded the entrance of consta-
ble small who announced that the judge
 was out somewhere but that willie
baker and nubby snell had been sent
scouting to find him

   i never heard of such an outrage
exploded the intensely annoyed hitch-
ens somebody is going to regret this
imposition time is valuable to us
and-

   dont git flustered and fly off the
handle mister advised deputy new-
berry twisting off a quid of war horse
with his teeth and stowing it bulging
into his cheek with a tongue made dex-
terous by long practice it wont jog-
gle things along no faster and i callate
youll be the one to do the regrettin
if you go shootin off a lot of loose
talk if you git sassy before the jedge
i warn ye now that itll probly land ye
in the caboose go slow is a motter
its best to foller around here

  why dont you tell them some-
thing persisted hitchens again ap-
pealing to his companion

  what talking i decide to do will
be done to the judge himself said
the older man

   in the course of fifteen minutes judge
wtiggin appeared he was a lean and
wiry man with a somewhat grim jaw
and a steely blue eye there was dig-
nity in his manner he scarcely

glanced at the prisoners as he seated
himself at the table opposite the clerk
and adjusted his spectacles to read the
complaint

  hats off he ordered rapping with
his knuckles john doe and richard
roe by the complaint of a deputy
sheriff and two constables by the town
of greenbush duly and legally author-
ized you are hereby charged with cata-
wamping a hossless vehicle over a pub-
lic highway lying within the town
limits at a speed of forty miles an
hour thereby rupturing the law made
and provided and wantonly and will-
fully endangering the peace and safety
of other persons who might find it nec-
essary to locomote upon said highway

  according to the complaint the
judge continued the before-mentioned
richard roe was the driver and the
before-mentioned john doe the owner
of said hossless vehicle at the time of
the infraction of said law that being
the fact the penalty administered in
case the charge is admitted or proven
will be applied in full to the person
who was engaged in piloting the jugger-
naut when you was nabbed and let
me add that in this court with the ex-
ception of the judge presiding unnec-
essary talk is- a luxury and luxuries
add to the high cost of living a word
to the wise is a seed sown upon good
ground that springeth up and beareth
the fruit of economy richard roe
guilty or not guilty

  biting his lip with annoyance the
younger of the two prisoners started
to protest it was necessary-er-
your honor that we should catch the
westward-bound train at albion if you
were aware who we are who your petty
officers hiding like highwaymen in am-
bush had ventured to hold up-

  again judge wiggins knuckles smote
the desk apparently he said my
observation regarding the expense of
unnecessary talk in this court failed to
sink in or even to make a dent no

excuse of private necessity condones
infractions of the law your careless
remark as well as the suspicious na-
ture of the names you have given leads
me to believe that you are pirooting
around the country under false colors
and makes it rather probable that you
are old offenders trying in that way
to dodge the extreme penalty the court
might see fit to administer if your real
identities was known i shall bear this
in mind in passing sentence

  the grinning spectators tittered
guardedly the older man reached out
and placed a hand on his companions
knee

  you can see that you are simply
making matters worse he whispered
anything you may say will be used
against us plead guilty at once

  squirming and rebellions hitchens
complied however instead of passing
sentence without delay the judge
squared away on his chair locked the
fingers of his hands before him and
proceeded to read the culprits a lengthy
lecture anent the rights of the common
people upon the highways and the out-
rageous and criminal manner in which
these rights were disregarded by auto-
mobilists in general

  during this scathing harangue he
scarcely looked at either of the impa-
tient and suffering victims but kept his
gaze fixed for the most part on the
rafters above their heads he was the
possessor of a fluent flow of language
and a somewhat homely native wit that
was keen and stinging and certain it
was that his vituperation was in no
degree delicately barbed even the self-
restraint of the elder man was tested
to the limit

  and presently when the fine of
twenty-five dollars and costs-twenty-
eight dollars and thirty cents all told
-had been inflicted and paid over the
owner of- the motor car released the
safety valve

  judge wiggin he said im com-
shaming the speed limit



pelled to tell you that it has never
been my misfortune to witness a greater
farce or a more ridiculous travesty of
justice you made it absolutely evi-
dent that from the very beginning
your mind was made up and that you
would impose a fine regardless of ex-
tenuating circumstances you practi-
cally warned us that any attempt at de-
fense would merely increase the sum
of money you were determined to get
out of us such narrow-minded big-
otry stamps you as a man unfit to rep-
resent this district in the legislature

  nathan wiggin bent a grim and
steady eye upon him and them few
remarks he returned placidly con-
stitute a clear case of contempt for
which i shall have to tuck on another
twenty-five dollars to preservethe dig-
nity of the court however consider-
ing the fact that the last time i heard
you speak from the stump you shot
off a whole lot of balderdash for all
of which the so-called intelligent voters
of this state saw fit to elect you gov-
ernor ill remit the fine and dis-
cretion being the better part of valor
let me suggest that you bottle up fur-
ther seething criticism until we both
get outside where as man to man we
can tell each other jest what we think
without mincin words

chapter vi

    a demonstration postponed

a bombshell exploding in that

    room could hardly have created a
greater sensation the governor the
governor of the state arrested for
speeding in the little town of greenbush
had been fined by judge wiggin who
as a would-be candidate for the legisla-
ture required the support and votes in
his district of the governors own party

  further than that more extraordi-
nary more incomprehensible having
immediately recognized the governor as

one of the two offenders the judge had
dared to reprimand him precisely as if
he were an ordinary citizen possibly
with a trifle more caustic severity and
nat wiggin was altogether too shrewd
and long-headed not to realize that a
single word from the chief executive
of the state would be almost certain to
blast his political ambitions 

  nevertheless a little calm thought
would have led wiggins neighbors
there assembled to realize that his fear-
less action was precisely what they
might have expected of him never
in his life had he played the toady and
he was not a person to cringe in the
presence-of power and pomp with-
out fear or favor was his motto and
right or wrong he adhered to it hard-
headed and obstinate he might be but
he was not inconsistent

  the spectators crowded forward on
tiptoe gaping almost aghast frown-
ing and grim his face purple with
anger the governor stared at the judge
calrfi and unperturbed as a june morn-
ing the latter announced that court was
adjourned and rose from his seat
trembling with deepest indignation the
governors secretary pulled at his elbow

  come urged hitchens in a low
tone lets get out before i lose con-
trol of myself and twist that old luna-
tics nose

  i dont thitik youd better try that
here or elsewhere under any provoca-
tion returned the chief executive
ive a notion hed take as much pleas-
ure in fighting as in fining a speeder

  they turned toward the stairs the
spectators still staring wide-eyed clat-
tering back to open a lane through
which they could pass weeping buz-
zell was ahead of them galvanized into
unusual and amazing activity

  make way for the governor he
snuffled waving his arms

  down the stairs in advance he
stumped bursting with eagerness to
carry the news to those apathetic towns-


top-notch magazine

men who had not been drawn by curi-
osity to the courtroom marvelous and
incredible was the swiftness with which
that news spread small boys carried
it scurrying the governor had been
nabbed for breaking the speed limit
judge wiggin had reprimanded and
fined him villagers of both sexes and
all ages came hurrying toward turners
store anxious to get a glimpse of the
notable who had met such summary
and impartial treatment at the hands
of the jedge hitchens saw them
assembling

  lets get out of this hole he urged
all the jays in the town will be here
in less than ten minutes he made
for the automobile which stood in front
of the store headed down the street

  weve got to find george said the
governor following its odd he hasnt
shown up wonder whats become of
him

  as they paused irresolutely beside
the motor car the judge having issued
forth approached there was nothing
placating or apologetic in his manner
nor did he wear an offensive defiant
air

  governor he said if youd seen
fit to notify me by telefome that busi-
ness of importance made it necessary
for you to go skihooting through this
town id have had the speed limit
raised to fifty miles an hour for the
occasion and the officers keepin an
open and clear road for ye but when
you was ketched and hauled up before
me same as any other private person
and give a fictitious name i figgered
there was only one way to handle the
case which was the same as id handle
any other im agin these here high-
way locomotives on principle and id
fine the czar of roosia if he was tooik
up for speeding in one within the limits
of this town

  something like a faint smile began
to play around the corners of the gov-
ernors mouth how many timeshave

you ridden in an automobile judge
wiggin  he asked

  jest about as many times as youve
rid on the tail of a comet governor
a good fast-steppin hoss suits me
exactly and youve driven some
fast steppers in your time no doubt
youve driven them through the streets
of this town at a much greater speed
than eight miles an hour thus endan-
gering the lives of pedestrians and
others upon the highways

  endangerin fiddlesticks i know
how to handle hosses sir ive broke
and trained hundreds of em in my
day i know how to guide em and
how to stop em

  still you may not realize that an
expert driver of a motor car has far
more perfect control over his machine
than the driver of a spirited horse can
possibly have over the animal like-
wise an auto moving at the same rela-
tive speed as a horse attached to a
carriage may be stopped more quickly
than the horse therefore the machine
properly handled is a smaller menace
to human safety than a horse-drawn
carriage

  governor said nathan p wiggin
politeness forbids me to tell you jest
what i think of that statement be-
sides ive got my coat on

  if youre too prejudiced said the
governor get into this car with me
and you shall have a demonstration
just how this invitation would have
been received at that moment cannot
be said through the crowd came a
panting freckled red-headed young
man flinging people aside with his long
arms

  hey jedge wiggin he called
chokingly bessies gone crazy come
home quick

whuts that lem dodd cried the
judge snapping round and grabbing the
young man by the shoulder my dar-
ter-gone crazy what dye mean
jest whut i say insisted lem dodd
shaming the speed limit



chokingly she brung a strange young
feller inter the house and hes got a
crack on his cabeza and he keeled over
on the parlor sofy and he looked like
he was a goner with his eyes shet and
she hollered and flopped on her knees
beside him and called him reginal
and dear and called herself a mur-
derer and kissed him right slap on the
kisser he caught his breath with a
gulping sound of distress and when
miss sally asked her who he was she
said she didnt know and he dont
blong round these parts for i never
see him before and shes crazy as a
june bug or shed never do no such
thing

  this said the judge is a case for
immejiate investigation under the cir-
cumstances governor well have to
postpone that demonstration till some
future date

  then he set off for his home a short
distance up the street accompanied by
the agitated and urgent lemuel dodd

chapter vii

a novice at the wheel

tpre governor and hitchens made
inquiry of the crowd regarding
their missing driver but no one pres-
ent seemed to haye seen the man pres-
ently the governor turned to his sec-
retary

  you dont imagine he asked in a
low tone that the young man who is
injured in judge wiggins house can
be george 

  the girl called him reginald ac-
cording to that fellow who brought
word to the judge

  still ive got a queer notion that it
may be the boy lets investigate
when they reached wiggins front
door george a bandage tied round his
head was just coming out followed by
the judge who seemed to be highly dis-
turbed and indignant

  im all right now governor called
the young man reassuringly a dis-
agreeable bull helped me over a fence
and i sort of collapsed after walking
into town 

  governor said nathan wiggin
grimly as near as i can find out your
shuffer climbed a tree to git away from
a toothless half-blind old shepherd dog
and run like the devil when libbys bull
took after him then he follered my
darter home and walked right into the
house arter her whuther or not he
was shammin when he flopped on the
sofy with his eyes shet bessie was upsot
and made a touse over him shes a
ruther emotional girl my sisters
lookin after her now and ive told
her what i think of shuffers in genral
and young ijien that climb trees to get
away from dogs without teeth enough
to dent a biscuit

  the governor laughed there may
be an excuse for the young man he
said he was bitten by a vicious dog
when very young but i dont think bulls
could scare him much he put his
arm across the shoulders of the young
man are you sure youre not hurt
much george

  well not on the head was the re-
ply but that girl came pretty near
finishing me shes a perfect witch

and i-

  such a statement concerning my
darter is slanderous considering the
fuss she imade over him said judge
wiggin in deep resentment but i
dont spose its anything more than
could be expected of an ordinary
shuffer

  again the governor laughed in a
peculiar way perhaps not he ad-
mitted turning back to the judge id
like to convince you however that my
argument about automobiles wa right
and as long as you prevented me from
catching my train after i had spent
three hours persuading ephraim glover
of palmyra to withdraw and not con-


top-notch magazine

test you in the primaries i think it is
up to you to give me the chance

  first nathan wiggin looked aston-
ished and then slowly his face turned
red

  was that whut brought you inter
these parts he asked

  that was the principal business
glover was so hard to handle that i
was delayed until it was only possible
for me to get back by train in time
for an important meeting to-night
judge wiggins embarrassment was
painful governor he said circum-
stances alter cases im ruther sorry
circumstances interfered with that im-
portant appintment of yours but
whinin never stopped a blister from
smarting and its too late to dodge after
youve been jabbed by the business end
of a hornet although ive said id
never set foot in one of them gas-
wagon contraptions considering whos
invited me if youll agree to proceed
circumspect and decorous within the
town limits and promise to land me
back here safe and sound im going
to take you up

  done accepted governor bradley
come along judge

  back to turners grocery where the
bigger part of the curious crowds still
hovered around the touring car they
went the governor walking arm in arm
with nathan wiggin greatly to the
wonderment of the staring throng

  i want you to sit on the forward
seat so that you can watch the driver
operate the car judge said the gov-
ernor opening one of the forward
doors get in

  the incredulous and bewildered spec-
tators gasped when the judge complied
without a murmur to this invitation
lem dodd had said that bessie wiggin
had gone crazy and now it seemed that
bessies father was ready for a padded
cell

  wull what dye think o that
mumbled old abner nutter poking his

thumb into the ribs of joshua phil-
brook the jedge-goin bubble ridin
arter hes swore a hundred times that
there wasnt money enough in the
united states treasury to hire him to set
in one o them berjiggered things ive
heerd him say it with my own two
ears

  theyve hippynotized him was
philbrooks opinion nothin else ex-
plains it he aint in his right mind

  perhaps youd better let hitchens
drive george said the governor ad-
dressing the injured young man i de-
clare youre pale sure youre not
badly hurt

  somehow walking makes me dizzy
was the answer still im feeling bet-
ter i think -ill step into this store
and get a drink of water

  having become suddenly anxious the
chief executive followed him into the
store hitchens fretful and none too
well pleased with the governor for wast-
ing so much time on wiggin left the
latter sitting in the car and mounted
the store steps

  aware that the accusing eyes of his
fellow townsmen were upon him na-
than wiggin gave his attention to the
mechanism of the car as displayed be-
fore him he examined the levers and
pedals squinted at the clock and the
speedometer and the gasoline gauge
he wondered at the numerous contriv-
ances of push buttons and small levers
on the dash he even bent forward
and curiously moved one of the latter
from one side to the other about that
time a bold urchin who had climbed on
the running board released the emer-
gency brake

  it was a cry of warning from some-
body in the crowd that made judge
wiggin aware that the car was moving
it had been standing on a gentle in-
cline with its nose pointing down the
long main street and had started as
soon as the brake wras set free
shaming the speed limit



  hey shouted an excited voice
shes goin jump jedge 

  nathan wiggin did not jump he -
was not greatly alarmed at first the
thing had barely started it was not
running away he had broken and
trained vicious horses that other men
could do nothing with some of them
veritable man-killers and surely he
could stop an inanimate contrivance like
a motor car especially when it was not
under power possibly he was re-
strained also by a conviction that he
could not abandon the car with dig-
nity and by the knowledge that to
abandon it at all under such circum-
stances would possibly make him an
object of ridicule he knew with what
keen gusto the greenbushers harped
on a joke and nagged the victim
thereof

  whoa said the judge moving
quickly over into the drivers seat and
grasping the wheel whoa back

  the car moved on those persons who
had been in front of it hastily scram-
bling out of the way the judge braced
hard with one foot against the clutch
pedal but that did not seem to have
any effect he grabbed one of the
levers thinking it might be the brake
and gave it a yank it was the lever
that manipulated the gears at the same
time his foot slipped off the clutch
pedal

  thrown into gear the moving car
cranked itself and the engine leaped to
life with a sudden vibrating hum for
in shifting the tiny lever on the dash
judge wiggin had made connections
with the magneto the surprised man
gasped as the machine gave a sudden
forward lunge like a horse beneath the
stinging cut of a whip almost before
he could gasp twice the confounded
thing was running away

 whoa shouted the dismayed man
commandingly surging back on the
wheel with all his strength if the bit
holds ill break your jaw you-

  one foot was planted on the accelera-
tor jamming it down and opening the
throttle wide the engine roared be-
neath the quivering hood the car
made a jump that seemed to take all
four wheels off the ground judge
wiggins hat flew off his sparse gray
hair stood on end his eyes bulged but
between his parted drawn-back lips his
teeth were set behind him he heard
the horrified shouts of the crowd
through which hitchens had vainly tried
to plow a path in time to board the
machine before it could get beyond his
reach realizing he had failed hitch-
ens stopped and flung up his arms in
despair

  the old fool he groaned hell
smash the car hell be killed

worse than a wild horse

a nnoyed and amazed by the in-
explicable and cantankerous be-
havior of the automobile nathan wig-
gin avas at the same time aroused to
resentment  and wrath the con-
founded thing was acting exactly like
a wild viciously ugly unbroken colt
immediately the judges fighting blood
rose he was stirred by the tingling
joy of contest it throbbed in every
vein of his body still holding the
throttle wide open with one foot he
planted the other on the brake and
sawed at the wheel

  the things the automobile did then
made it seem more than ever like a
strong and furious young horse battling
against restraint and mastery it bucked
and plunged in jerky jumps it pitched
fence-cornered from side to side after
the style of a western broncho it
snorted and choked and snorted again

  whoa you dratted catamaran
snarled the judge youve gotter
whoa or ill take your jaw off

  only for the down grade he might
have stalled the engine before the rack-

ing of the car caused his foot to fly
off the brake pedal when that hap-
pened it continued on its way down the
hill toward the wooden bridge that
spanned the swampscott river sway-
ing from one side of the road to the
other at times it threatened to climb
trees or telephone poles or crash
through fences and plunge like a bat-
tering-ram into the fronts of houses or
stores but always the crazy machine
swerved in time to avoid disaster and
shot across to the other side of the
road

  when his right hand slipped from
the wheel the judge grabbed the side
of the car body and his clutching thumb
jammed down the button that operated
the electric siren the button stuck
and the siren howled like a doomed
demon of despair causing nathan wig-
gins hair to stand up stiff as the bristles
 a horse brush

  the fearsome sound of the wailing
whistle brought people running to win-
dows to behold a sight  one in green-
bush had ever expected to see-judge
wiggin driving an automobile to say
that he was driving it more than bor-
ders on hyperbole it would be far
closer to the truth to state that it was
driving him-frantic he was not
habitually a profane man but he pos-
sessed a broad vocabulary of vigorous
expletives of a more or less impious
nature and it must be admitted that
the language he addressed to that mo-
tor car would have shocked a parson
those who dashed to their windows in
time to see him shoot zigzagging past
beheld a man that was little short of
raving mad

  hens that had been scratching peace-
fully in the village street fled squawk-
ing barking furiously a yellow dog
charged out the car leaped at the
animal struck it with one forward
wheel and sent it spinning and howl-
ing into the gutter

 deaf as a doormat old betsy

tucker going to market with a hand
basket containing two dozen eggs
neither saw nor heard until the run-
away auto was perilously close upon
her and the judge was howling like a
maniac for her to clear the road
then she gave a yell and threw up
her arms flinging basket and eggs into
the air she was saved by sheer luck
for the judge plunging at the wheel
turned the machine so that it missed
her by less than a foot the basket
came down bottom up on nathan wig-
gins head and the eggs-well for
some moments thereafter the judge
could not have seen to drive had he
possessed the required skill from his
shoulders up he resembled the initial
preparation of an omelet

  holy sassafras he spluttered
its raining fish glue everything
happens at once

  as soon as he could blink a pair of
peepholes through that golden film-he
did not dare let go with his hands to
wipe his eyes-he saw that the foot
of the hill was almost reached and that
the bridge across the peacefully flowing
river lay just ahead it was not a very
wide bridge and tobias blaisdell
perched on a load of hay drawn by
two horses was just driving on to the
far end

  back up you blinkety-blank jay-
hawker yelled the judge make a
clear passage or ill bore a tunnel in
ye

  had he been less excited he would
have realized that it was much too late
for such a cumbersome obstruction to
get out of the way blaisdell had time
only to check his horses and stare in
horror at the shrieking engine of de-
struction that was charging upon him
he did not recognize nathan wiggin
in the egg-bespattered wild man who
seemed to be guiding the humming
mechanism of disaster but he knew
that in about four seconds unless a
miracle intervened horses motor car
shaming the speed limit



hay and human beings were going to
be mixed in a spectacular and tragic
smash

  then as the uncontrolled automo-
bile reached the middle span of the
bridge the miracle took place shoot-
ing suddenly to one side the machine
struck the wooden railing and went
through it as if it had been constructed
of clay pipestems into the deepest
part of the river it plunged flinging up
a great solash of spray and disappeared
from view nathan wiggin of green-
bush vanished with it

chapter ix

when the limit came off

the shouts of the startled crowd in
front of turners grocery had
brought those within the store rushing
out to learn the cause of alarm the
governor came with them followed a
second later by the young man who
had been tossed by libbys bull they
beheld the motor car well under way
and the judge struggling frantically and
ineffectually to restrain it

  great guns groaned the governor
turning pale wiggins started the
demonstration on his own hook hell
smash a four-thousand-dollar car and
his neck at the same time

  the young man with the bandaged
head stiffened if he felt weak or
dizzy at that moment he flung it off
instantly with a single bound he was
at the foot of the store steps against
which leaned a bicycle left there tem-
porarily by some one he grabbed the
bicycle uttering a ringing shout for
everybody to get out of the way

  through the scattered crowd he
dashed leaping to the saddle and catch-
ing the pedals with his nimble feet
bending over the handlebars he
started in pursuit of the automobile
which by this time was halfway down
the hill with the wailing siren in full
blast

  continuing to jabber and shout the
crowd followed stringing out in a strag-
gling line boys and younger men were
in the lead middle-aged bewhiskered
bald-headed men came next the rear
guard was made up of the aged and
decrepit the very last one of all bent
with rheumatism and hobbling with the
aid of two canes being zebediah tit-
comb the sage of greenbush

  never since its foundation had the
sleepy town of greenbush beheld such
a spectacle never in its history had
there been such tremendous excitement
within its boundaries the end of all
things terrestrial could scarcely have
created a greater hullabaloo in that tor-
pid community

  the young man on the bicycle was
not able to overtake the runaway mo-
tor car before it reached the bridge
but he was not far behind it when
the automobile smashed through the
railing and leaped into the river he
jumped from the bicycle and followed
it without the slightest hesitation

  he was an excellent swimmer and
rising from the plunge he saw the head
of nathan wiggin bob to the surface
within reach of his arm immediately
he fastened a hand on the mans collar

  keep still stop thrashing he
said and ill get you out

  the somewhat difficult task of res-
cuing judge wiggin from drowning was
accomplished while the panting throng
that had reached the bridge looked on
and cheered reaching shallow water
the young man assisted the judge to
his feet and both waded forth to dry-
land

  arriving on shore the older man im-
mediately sat down facing the river
beneath the sluggish surface of which
governor bradleys automobile lay im-
mersed after a few choking gulps he
began to speak in accents and words
of the utmost self-contempt

  nate wiggin he said addressing
himself youve lived to be fifty-four


top-notch magazine

year old and arrived at the conclusion
that there wasnt anything that traveled
on legs or wheels that you couldnt
handle which goes to show that when
a man thinks he knows all there is to
know about anything a shrinkage has
set in about half an inch beneath the
roots of his hair a wise fool is about
as safe to have round as a stick of dyna-
mite bakin in the oven of a red-hot
stove if he dont damage nobody else
hes pretty likely to blow up and bust
himself

  the governor and his secretary fol-
lowed by a few others came hurrying
to the spot seeing them approach the
judge got upon his feet dripping tiny
rivulets

  governor he observed theres no
great loss without some small gain
youll save the price of a wash for that
there automobile whatever damage or
expense may accrue i calate ill have
to sustain i guess we can find a way
to get her out

  im thankful said governor brad-
ley that you were not killed

  i dont see wrhy that should choke
you with joy in your place id probly
be so blazin mad id start in to murder
somebody

  his eyes streaming and his nose snuf-
fling weeping buzzell broke in  oba-
daiah cobb has come along with his
hoss and wagon hes right there at
the end of the bridge and hell take
ye home jedge you better git outer
them wet clothes if you dont want to
ketch your everlarsting

  im no wettern this young feller
who yanked me outer the drink said
the judge hes got to come along to
the house with me and get fixed up
and you too governor and tother
gentleman-you come i insist on it
youre going to stop with me the whole
caboodle of ye to supper hosspitality
deferred may be hosspitality soured but
ill guarantee to do my best to sweeten
it up on this occasion

  by this time it seemed that by far
the greater portion of the inhabitants
of the town were packed upon the
bridge or jamming the roadway and
when obadiah cobb took the governor
the judge and the other two men into
his double seater and started back up
the hill with them the crowd laughed
and cheered again

  governor said judge wiggin i
dunno whether thats meant for you
or for the young man who hauled me
out of the stream but either way its
proper well deserved if you hadnt
been dead game youd have kicked like
a steer over whats happened and if
he wasnt good grit to the xme hed
never have gone into the river arter me
which is admittin i made a mistake in
sizing him up when i found my darter
making a touse over him

  among the few villagers who re-
mained unaware of the recent lively
events were judge wiggins sister and
his daughter of course they were
thrown into a great flutter miss sally
said my stars  what miss bessie
said was whispered into the ear of the
water-soaked but smiling young man
who gave her a look and a sly squeeze
of the hand that brought a rosy flush
to her cheeks

  dry clothes were found also a little
nip of something to parry off chills
wtarming up the participants in the ad-
venture joked and laughed even though
the judge seemed to have something
on his mind that was giving him some
serious thought what this was ap-
peared later after they had partaken of
a genuine old-fashioned new england
supper topped off with doughnuts and
hot apple pie and steaming fragrant
coffee

  turning his eyes to the governor who
sat at the right of miss sally nathan
wiggin said governor putting aside
the question of damages i owe on ac-
count of what happened to your auto-
mobile  i calate its up to me to ex-
shaming the speed limit



press my appreciation of whut you done
to induce ephraim glover to take back
and give me a clear field with a clear
start i reckon i can carry this dees-
trict and help you to carry the county
anyhow im going to lay myself out
to do it

  that sounds good to me laughed
the governor

  furthermore pursued the host
ive decided to abolish the trapping
of automobile drivers in this here town
mebbe he admitted this may appear
a leetle dite selfish on my part as havin
got my dander up by the pranks played
on me by that there gas go-cart of
yourn governor im contemplating buy-
ing one myself and running the con-
sarned cantraption until i git it tamed
if there was traps hereabouts mebbe
id git took up and have to fine myself
for busting the speed limit therefore
henceforth there aint going to be no
speed limit in greenbush

  beneath the edge of the table old
shep attempting to lick bessies hand
with his tongue licked also the hand
of the young man who sat beside her
and before sitting down the young
people had found an opportunity quite
unobserved to exchange a few words
in private somehow neither of them
had evinced any great desire for food
but while george was still unnaturally
pale the roses continued to bloom in
bessies cheeks

  now george spoke up boldly as
long as you have abolished the speed
limit judge wiggin i am going to im-
prove the occasion to ask you for your
daughters hand in marriage doubt-
less it will seem rather hasty to you
but everything has moved with a rush
this afternoon i have put the question
to bessie and won her consent

  the governor stared miss nancy
nearly fainted bessie wiggin trembled
visibly nathan p wiggin gazed hard
at the young man for about thirty sec-

onds and then scratched his chin a
queer pucker screwing up his face

  wull i declare said the judge at
last that is going some never
quite reckoned on my darter hookin
up with a shuffer but having saved
me from drownding youve took me at
a disadvantage if bessie has said yes
and you kin furnish the proper cree-
denshuls ill have to take your propo-
sition under consideration i guess

  the governor looked bessie wiggin
over appraisingly and decided that he
had made no mistake in thinking her
an unusually pretty and charming young
lady

  it is sudden he said laughing
softly and it would not have happened
if george had not offered to drive for
me to-day my regular chauffeur being
ill in the way of credentials judge
let me state that he is my son

  the judges sister sat bolt upright
in a jiffy the judge coughed behind
his hand the pucker crinkling the cor-
ners of his eyes

  them creedenshuls governor he
stated are wholly satisfactory to me
his whole body seemed to shake oddly
im afraid im going to have a chill
after all he added i think the gov-
ernor and me had better take a little
walk in the moonlight

the visitor

is that clock right  asked the visitor
who had already oustayed his wel-
come

  his hostess yawned oh no she
said thats the clock we always call
the visitor 

the obdurate one sat down again

   the visitor  he remarked
what a curious name to give a clock
his hostess ventured to explain

  you see she cooed sweetly we
call it that because we can never make
it go

by arthur brooks baker

qphe jitney is a humble coin of nickel and alloy
     quite admirably fitted to the uses of a boy

it buys a sack of goobers from the gay sicilian gent

it gets a fellow past the chap who guards the movie tent

not very many years ago the jitney was so small
that men of dignity refused to notice it at all

and then there came an era of magicians who like yates
could hammer with the jitney on the tallest social gates

the little coin was gathered by our thrifty telephones
for twenty thousand jitneys constitute a thousand bones
and then the lowly thing achieved the sacred realm of art-
the great and thrilling photo-plays had won the public heart

to-day-let all the poets tune their celebrative chimes-
the holiest tradition of our mighty modern times
is broken by the jitney for the taxicabic cinch

whose cheerful transportation rate was thirty cents an inch
is humbled and is jumbled by the jolly jitney bus

while common folks throw up their hats and make a merry
     fuss

one chorus if no other then the jitney song repeats

young gray head

t would have puzzled a gov-
ernment expert to give a
plausible reason for the erec-
tion of the blockhouse bar-
racks and stockade beyond
the black hills that even the army
teamsters christened fort extra its
uselessness was so palpable that when
colonel brown had completed his first
tour of inspection of his district after
assuming command he decided that
fort extra was to be abandoned es-
pecially as the probable exigencies of
the service would require a concentra-
tion of the meager force at his dis-
posal for the protection of that fron-
tier

  a colonel was a great man in those
old days and his word was law-until
the secretary of war should be heard
from the brief importance of the
little post was therefore over and prep-
arations for leaving it went forward

  colonel brown had not only a wife
who was brave and charming but a
blooming daughter and both annie and
her mother had accompanied the gray-
haired commander on his tour of in-
spection they had enjoyed it very
much but by the time they had arrived
at fort extra the unwonted fatigue and
exposure had proved for the while a
little too much and it became neces-
sary for them to rest a-few days this
was all the more vexatious to the colo-
nel as his presence was imperatively
demanded at fort berry which was
forty miles and more southeast of the
black hills to attend a council of the
indian commissioners to arrange a
treaty with the pawnees and other
tribes he did not like to go without
his dear ones but duty was duty and
he could hardly have explained to him-
self the strange feeling of dread that
tugged at his heart as he kissed them
good-by and rode away

  annie said mrs brown as she
wiped the tears from her eyes we

must move just as quickly as we are
able

  so we must mother agreed annie
but since i am hardly sick at all i
must take care of you and make sure
that you do not start too soon

  your father said that he had left
orders for the supplies and heavier
materials to be moved to fort berry at
once there are no cannon except the
small howitzer and by the time we are
ready we can have the poor little fort
empty

  do you know mother said annie
i sometimes feel half sorry for the
poor little fort as you call it it seems
likea case of cruel desertion

  still annie replied the colonels
wife i shall be very glad when i feel
able to ride again and lieutenant dean
tells me he is ready

  so will i mother what a fine old
fellow lieutenant dean is with his
scarred face and his gray mustache
i am glad he is in command just now
yes said her mother there seems
to be something solid and reliable about
him so different from those young
sprigs they are sending out here from
west point

  meanwhile never dreaming that he
could be made a subject of conversation
for the ladies the lieutenant or as he
himself preferred to be called when
addressed unofficially plain john dean
was busy in another part of the forti-
fication superintending the departure of
the convoys of supplies and other mate-
rials in pursuance of colonel browns
orders in his inmost heart he was
hoping that the indisposition of the
ladies would not continue long for the
attitude of some of the more powerful
tribes was more than threatening and
he felt that every man he sent away
was an important subtraction from what
might at any moment become the means
of protecting his charges

  john dean was what in a day when
the officers of the army were almost

  an aristocratic caste by themselves
might have been called one of the acci-
dents of the service a gentleman no
doubt of it but seemingly entirely with-
out friends or influence and with some
inscrutable jealousy against him in the
bureaus at washington somehow
after years of faithful service he had
seen incompetence and worthlessness
again and again promoted over his head
until his heart was sore and faint within
him and he had begun to think that his
days would be spent with but one
bar on his shoulder straps no matter
how assiduously ably or brilliantly he
might perform his arduous and perilous
duties

  old dean his fellow officers some-
times called him and yet although his
strongly marked manly features were
crowned by a bushy head of iron-gray
hair dean was in the very prime of
early manhood-only thirty-six and
with a heart as fresh as a boys his
frontier service had taught him more
of the wiles of the red man than of
the dangerous characteristics of the bet-
ter half of his own race he was still
young

  great as was his anxiety about mrs
brown and her beautiful daughter
lieutenant dean would hardly have
dreamed of showing it otherwise than
by his professional care for their safety
no ladies man was he but no woman
could have asked for a truer knight or
a better defender than the young gray-
head as the indians called him with
his towering frame and his sinews of
steel

chapter ii

ragged hands signature

rphe colonel and his escort arrived
safely at fort berry to find the
expected array of commissioners and
traders waiting for them and for the
painted heroes of the plains to come
in and be palavered
fort extra



  the appointed day for the powwow
came and some of the expected sav-
ages were on hand and some were not
for there was discontent abroad among
the tribes and trouble was brewing
almost every hour brought in some
news or rumor that added to the anxi-
ety of colonel brown concerning the
treasures he had left so scantily guarded
behind the palisades of fort extra

  nevertheless there was the cus-
tomary routine of councils and smoker
and solemn foolery of handshaking for
the pawnee bands at least had agreed
to the conditions proposed to them and
were ready to have their treaty signed

  all this however had been work for
the civilians and the army men had
nothing to do but to look dangerous
and look on with an internal convic-
tion that for all this formality and
humbug there would be little less duty
to be done thereafter in their own
peculiar line at last however when
the very act of signing was in hand
colonel brown stood by the door of
the commissioners tent with his staff
about him in full uniform grimly con-
scious that he and they were but acting
parts in an exceedingly doubtful drama

  chief after chief stepped forward
grandly and scrawled his token or made
his mark upon the formal parchment
under direction of their interpreters
and the colonel had regarded their strut
and vaporing with ill-disguised con-
tempt and disgust and now a
tall scarred ferocious-looking warrior
younger in years than most of the
others but fully their peer in ugliness
strode up to the improvised table he
seemed to be acquainted with the use
of a pen for he motioned aside the in-
terpreter with a disdainful ugh and
took the quill in his own hand

  but such a hand it was more like
the claws of the grizzly bear that hung
from the warriors own collar and that
elsewhere adorned his gaudy fantastic
dress colonel brown looked keenly at

ca

him from under his stiff gray eye-
brows and a young officer at his elbowr
remarked in an undertone

  did you ever see a paw like that
the colonel made no reply for he
half thought he had and in a moment
he was sure for the totem or rather
in this case the sign manual which
the haughty savage drew with the pen
was a tolerably neat outline of the bony
claws that made it and as he drew
back to his full height he bared his
arm to the elbow and said with swell-
ing pride as he displayed an almost
fleshless mass of sinews and tendons
ugh ragged hand big chief
friend of white man  ugh 

  and with this he turned on his heel
and stalked stately away to the solemn
group of his fellow chiefs

  montrose geary almost excitedly
called out the colonel to the officer who
had spoken and a man in civilian attire
who stood near him i know that fel-
low and i want to see him manage to
bring him around as soon as you can
the sharp quick tone of command
brought something like a flush to the
cheek of the young man addressed as
geary but the colonel added

  none of that my dear boy this is
a family matter and i shall be likely
to need your help especially as you
talk indian

  a pleasant though still somewhat
haughty smile arose in gearys dark
and handsome features he followed
montrose without a word until they
were beyond colonel browns hearing
then he said

 my confounded pride and the
colonel rubs it the wrong way all the
while you see captain montrose my
father was an army scout and inter-
preter before he bought his mines so
luckily and half the old officers i meet
seem to think i was born to obey their
orders he was a splendid scout and
fighter though and they all respected


top-notch magazine

him even the colonel seems to make
a friend of me for his sake

  he does indeed replied montrose
with an almost manifest twinge of jeal-
ousy and ive half a notion i know
what he wants to see that torn-up red-
skin for

  it may be that montrose was right
but an hour later found their errand
accomplished and a group of four gath-
ered in the colonels tent ragged
hand himself had been speaking and
oddly enough geary had been acting as
interpreter

  well ragged hand now replied
the colonel i am glad you feel so
grateful i only did for you what i
would have done for any brave fellow
in such a fix but this is bad news
no wonder the blackfeet bands didnt
want to come in two trains destroyed
and theyre waiting for the remainder
 hardly know what to do for im ter-
ribly short of men and fort berry
must not be left weak-handed cap-
tain montrose my wife and daughter
will be with this last train from that
unlucky fort extra-think of that
the colonels face grew ashy under
its beard and bronze and the young
men looked gravely at him and at one
another it was a startling and terrible
fact to talk about to a husband and
father soldier though he was

  colonel brown said montrose
after a brief pause our garrison is not
so small but what i can be spared writh
a squad to ride on and reenforce the
train at all events dean should be
warned of his danger

  and i suddenly exclaimed geary
i can raise a score of good men among
these chaps that are loafing around the
fort and ragged hand will send a
party of braves with us

  the old officer reached out both his
hands to the young men but the paw-
nee chief sententiously remarked and
geary rapidly interpreted-for the chief

understood better than he could speak
as is common

  ragged hand go-not send white
chief save him once made great brave
of him pawnee never forget

  yes added geary and its high
time i made my own acquaintance with
you look at that

  the pawnee gravely unwrapped the
packet handed him but his whole face
changed as he did so for it disclosed
the forepaw of a grizzly bear with curi-
ous notches on the claws

  who are you he asked of geary
my father gave me that was the
reply and he told me it would make
a friend among the pawnees

 son of many tongues said
ragged hand as he took a long look
at the tall and handsome young white
man well very glad father good
friend go get men no time now for
great talk

  wrhat does he say eagerly asked
the colonel will he go geary rap-
idly explained

  he is right said the colonel
there is not an hour to lose i fear
you have a dangerotis scout before you
for the blackfeet are out in great force
montrose you take twenty men of your
own company and geary may enlist
as many volunteers as he can find they
will all be in government service for
the time the sooner you are off the
better

  the pawnee chief had disappeared
silently even while the colonel was
speaking and the two young men
quickly took their leave and hastened
away to their preparations as they
walked on for a moment side by side
montrose said to his companion

  if you only knew what a splendid
girl the colonels daughter annie is
youd be able to muster any amount of
enthusiasm at being sent out to save
her

  i met her in washington last win-
ter somewhat coldly responded geary
fort extra



i may say i know her very well i
shall be ready to start by nightfall i
think

  a quick flash sprang to the blue eyes
of the army captain and one as rapid
and even more dangerous looking met
it in those of geary there was silence
for a moment but the soldier had best
control of himself for he spoke first
so much the better as you are to
be under my command i desire you to
have your men provided with three
days rations

 under your command was the
quick and half-angry reply

  certainly and so will the pawnees
be it wont do to have two heads on
an expedition like this you would not
expect to command regular army men 
it was evidently all that geary could
do to command himself for the idea
of being a subordinate had not entered
his head before but he managed to an-
swer between his teeth

  of course not ill be ready

  as he walked away however he
mentally registered a vow that his un-
dertaking in behalf of the colonels
daughter should be on his own hook
nor was he far out of the way in his
imagination that captain montrose was
at the same time chuckling to himself
over the supposed fact that any merit
and success that might be won would
be credited to himself as the officer in
commafld still he was too good a
fighter not to be prompt and thorough
in getting his men ready for the under-
taking his wide acquaintance with the
scouts traders and mountain men who
had been brought to the fort by the oc-
casion and the word that he wanted
volunteers to rescue a train from the
blackfeet and that there were women
in danger brought the rough-and-
ready fellows around him in short or-
der in less than an hour he had nearly
forty men in the saddle with rations
for three days armed with their own
rifles

  all the while however gearys pride
and jealousy were waxing hot and
fierce within him and when he was
ready he waited for no orders from
montrose nor even from the colonel
but led his well-mounted band of dar-
ing spirits swiftly away from the length-
ening shadows of fort berry he had
plenty of men with him who knew every
inch of the road he was to travel

  great was the wrath and disappoint-
ment of captain montrose when he
heard of gearys departure but his dis-
gust was even deeper when word was
brought from the pawnee camp that
ragged hand and a round hundred of
his best warriors also had taken the
trail for the black hills

  there was no time now however for
even a complaint to colonel brown ajnd
before the september sun had sunk be-
low the horizon he and his blue-coated
cavalry were ready for the saddle

chapter iii

a word in time

oeveral days went by after the de-
parture of colonel brown from fort
extra and john dean had steadily
pressed forward his preparations for
abandoning the post first one train
and then another had been loaded up
and started off across the endless
prairie but the guard that could be
sent with either of them was but slen-
der considering that the blackfeet
bands were on the warpath

  mrs brown and annie were quickly
on their feet and anxious to be off and
kept as close to the lieutenant as if their
constant presence could aid and hasten
him in the discharge of his duties he
on bis part treated them with a sub-
dued and respectful courtesy that the
colonels wife found immensely agree-
able but annie more than once found
herself in the mental act of extending
a species of gentle commiseration to the
officer who wore so self-rebuked and


top-notch

magazine

yet so dignified and manly a demeanor
she respected him from the bottom of
her heart even while she half wished
that he would be more attentive and
companionable

  as they were strolling one afternoon
around the already half-deserted little
fort they came upon their protector
standing by the gateway of the block-
house talking with a man who evi-
dently had just dismounted from the
blown and reeking horse whose lariat
he was still holding

  mrs brown said the lieutenant in
a suppressed and all but husky voice
we have had bad news this man is
the only survivor of our last train and
i fear that the first one has shared the
same fate

  hardly a doubt of it exclaimed
the man himself i reckon their luck
was a good deal like ourn

  that is terrible indeed exclaimed
mrs brown do you suppose the
colonel can have heard of it

  i think not said the lieutenant
but it is necessary that he should
if we ourselves are ever to get in
jones you are too tired for another
ride send jose the vaquero here at
once

  the man touched his hat and was
gone and they three stood by the gate-
way talking until an undersized wiry
dark-looking man reined in his horse in
front of them as if waiting for orders

  jose said the lieutenant ride for
your life to fort berry take the up-
per pass through the black hills tell
colonel brown that i shall do the same
and shall start early to-morrow morn-
ing tell him also-that both the other
trains went by way of the lower pass
and that they have been destroyed by
the blackfeet hand him also this dis-
patch do you understand

  si senor replied the man as he
touched his cap and in a moment more
he was off and away on his perilous
errand

  why mr dean exclaimed mrs
brown i would so have liked to send
a message to the colonel

  pardon me replied the lieutenant 
but i was only thinking of your safety
and every minute is golden just now
the elder lady looked half offended
but annie thought within herself that
john deans want of politeness was
almost a merit she said nothing how-
ever and the remainder of the day wore
away gloomily enough at fort extra

  no other man can ride faster and
farther without rest than a california
vaquero and no other horse can gallop
under him more miles than the cali-
fornia-bred burro that jose was riding
some thirty hours thereafter the tire-
less vaquero spurred his spent and tot-
tering steed up the sloping roadway to
the gates of fort berry just as colo-
nel brown rode out to say a word to
captain montrose before his departure

  promptly almost mechanically jose
delivered his dispatch and his message
and then horse and man seemed to fail
and sink helplessly to the ground to-
gether there were strong hands ready
to help them but the colonel himself
seemed hardly to give them a thought

  this news is indeed opportune he
said to the captain you will now
strike for the upper pass i will send
word after the pawnees and that hot-
headed fool geary but you must not
wait for them	

  yes colonel good-by responded
captain montrose as he again rode for-
ward

  wait for them or for anything
else why his heart was bouncing
with the thought that his possible rival
was on the wrong trail and that to him
alone would belong the task of res-
cuing the colonels daughter instead
of being ahead of him geary could
only come up as a sort of reenforce-
ment and would be under his com-
mand after all

  the colonel was as good as his word
fort extra



however about the messengers and be-
fore geary and his men had been on
the road four hours they were over-
taken by the news which the vaquero
had ridden so hard to bring

  once more the hot blood rushedto
the cheeks of geary he wondered if
after all montrose and his bluecoats
would not beat him in the race at
this moment the thunder of pounding
hoofs and loud yells in their rear an-
nounced the approach of ragged hand
and his wild riders hardly had the
new posture of affairs been explained
to the chief however when he solved
the difficulty with the quick authorita-
tive wisdom of a commanding general

  they would not change their line of
march he said for it was too late to
go by way of the upper  pass the
blackfeet would not now be at the lower
one they never stayed so long at one
place they would go through the
lower pass as they had intended and
follow up the other side of the range
of hills they would be likely to reach
the train from fort extra before cap-
tain montrose did even then

  the advice of the red warrior was
clearly good and it chimed admirably
with gearys own thoughts and wishes
as well as with those of his men who
much preferred being independent of
the regular troops

  and so late into the night the sev-
eral bands of hardy fighters red and
white rode steadily onward toward
whatever termination their adventurous
expedition might have but hardly
doubting that it would be a fierce one

chapter iv

the crest of a warrior

i ittle sleep had john dean or any
other of the scanty garrison of
fort extra on the night after he had
sent away the vaquero whether jose
got in safely with his news or not there
was but one course for the lieutenant

to take as the post was no longer tena-
ble many things that might other-
wise have been carried away were bat-
tered and broken beyond any future
usefulness and thrown away in all di-
rections they would have been burned
but that the lieutenant did not care to
kindle so dangerous a signal fire to in-
dicate his movements to the eyes of red-
skin prowlers

  shortly after sunrise the slender cav-
alcade was under way mrs brown
and annie on horseback like the rest
only four wagons remained and these
not heavily laden a team of six mules
tugged lazily at the mountain howitzer
two would have been enough but it
was a way of saving the mules

  john dean shook his iron-gray head
as he turned and looked back at the
little fortification he was abandoning
and then at his short three dozen of
blue-coated veterans under other cir-
cumstances he might have deemed the
one strong enough and the other an
army but now-

  ah mr dean just then exclaimed
annie brown i think i understand
you it seems almost like a capitula-
tion to the blackfeet i dont wonder
you feel badly

  no miss brown its only a change
of base replied he but we have a
long and dangerous ride before i can
put you and your mother under the pro-
tection of even such poor wooden walls
as those

  there was something in the tone of
deans voice and the expression of his
weather-beaten face that made annie
brown silent for a moment although
she could hardly have told herself why

  hour after hour went by and the
bright autumnal sun rose higher and
higher and so far there had been no
visible sign of anything like peril side
by side rode annie brown and her
mother and the gray-headed young offi-
cer and again and again as they
glanced at his resolute thoughtful face

the women felt a certain satisfaction
and confidence in their protector that
was very pleasant and reassuring

  noon came and with it a brief halt
for rest and refreshment but they had
hardly gone three miles after they
started again before as they mounted
one of the long low rolls of the prairie
they saw before them at no great dis-
tance an encampment evidently of
white men yet of a kind and style
that they could hardly have expected
there were only a couple of wagons
and beside these were pitched white
tents from these there came forward
to meet the train three or four men
rigged in what might have passed-in
london for instance-as an out-and-
out prairie sporting costume loud and
hearty was the greeting the strangers
gave but short and ominous enough
were john deans responses

  been to dinner ah so said one
of the strangers with a florid face and
wonderful whiskers would have been
very glad you know hardly thought
of meeting ladies out here to be sure
do you know half interrupted an-
other were in the most uncomfort-
able kind of a fix came here to hunt
and all that sort of thing and hardly
got out here before these confounded
men of ours refuse to go any farther
we havent seen an aborigine upon
my honor and these fellows wont talk
of anything but scalps and blackfeet
spoils our hunt entirely

  you may thank your men heartily
then replied john dean the red-
skins are out in force and you must
not attempt to go any farther

  we must not how am i to un-
derstand you i beg pardon of the
ladies but you said we must not go on
with our hunt

  no i only said you must go no
farther into the blackfeet range i pre-
sume i know some of your men and
i shall order them to turn back at once
and not stop until they have put the

black hills a days journey behind
them

  do i understand you sir said the
englishman getting redder and redder
in the face youll order my own men
to go back after ive hired them

  certainly i shall returned dean
with a smile but i earnestly request
you to hitch up at once and take ad-
vantage of our escort

  no indeed i want no escort but
my own its a piece of confounded
tyranny couldnt do it in england
you know all this talk about the in-
dians is moonshine sir-only to spoil
our hunt if i go back at all sir ill
go alone not but that i hope the
ladies will soon be in a place of safety
and i wish them an agreeable ride

  some other talk there was but dean
was as good as his word and passed
on with his train feeling sure that his
confounded tyranny would prevent
his english friends from going any far-
ther even if they would not turn back

  john dean was too good and experi-
enced a campaigner to exhaust his cat-
tle or his men on the first day out but
he made a good push of it and when
he went into camp the bald and ragged
outlines of the black hills stood out in
sharp relief against the sky of ever-
deepening blue the scene was one of
deep solitude and as the curtain of-
night fell on the little camp both annie
and her mother could not help being
infected by the deep overpowering
anxiety that made itself felt through
all the iron self-control of their friend
and guardian he wras morally sure
that if the blackfeet were not already
on their trail they would be before the
next sun rose not a wink did he sleep
that night but seemed to be in all parts
of the camp at once with a nervous
watchfulness that would not and could
not be caught napping

  their breakfast was over early the
next day and the train once more in
motion all the forenoon they pressed
fort extra



steadily onward still without a sign
of danger and all the while the barrier
of the hills that stood between them and
safety grew steadily nearer and nearer
when at last they halted though on
high and rising ground the outlying
spurs of the range on either side of them
indicated that the pass could not be
far to sk

  mr dean said mrs brown as the
lieutenant looked long and earnestly
through his field glass back upon their
trail do you see anybody coming
for a minute he was silent and she
added perhaps our english friends
have made up their minds to follow
us

  not they mrs brown we are in-
deed followed but we shall never see
anything more of those englishmen

  what do you mean asked annie
quickly

  i mean just this-that i have seen
the crest of a redskin warrior and the
blackfeet are between the englishmen
and any hope i am afraid their ob-
stinacy has ruined them

chapter v

caught in a trap

irom above the little clump of trees
where the camp of the rash hunters
had been away back there beyond an-
nie browns sight or the range of john
deans glass a dull and eddying cloud
of black smoke was rising away from
that cloud a swarm of mounted red
men were riding and under it there lay
the wrecks of burning wagons broken
weapons and the charred and mangled
forms of human beings

  there were signs too of a hard and
desperate fight the englishmen had
been no cowards and their guides and
men had been of the right sort the
blackfeet had paid dearly for their vic-
tory and the stubborn resistance they
had met had delayed their main body
long enough to give john dean and his

friends time to reach the hills unmo-
lested of course the lieutenant did
not know this yet he more than half
guessed it and as he lowered his glass
from another long look his voice rang
out with orders to his men to make
all haste

  half an hour now will bring us to
the pass he said to annie and then
we shall be safe

  safe  even as he said it the chill
at his heart told him that there could
be no safety for her or any of them
until they were behind the guns of fort
berry

  the half hour passed only too rap-
idly and every inch of the way the
shouting teamsters goaded their strain-
ing teams to quicker action all the
while the walls of the sloping valley
they were climbing grew steeper and
more wildly rugged on either side until
at last they found themselves within
the frowning portals of the upper pass
of the black hills then too as they
turned to look back down the steep
and winding ascent it needed no field
glass to discern the swarm of dark fan-
tastic threatening figures of the black-
feet braves who yelled and whooped
and charged upon the trail of what they
doubtless deemed their sure and easy
prey

  mr dean said annie calmly do
you think we can escape them

  we shall see he replied

  another minute the little howitzer
had unlimbered and shell after shell
went whizzing down the valley while
the train still pressed on

  hold up boys for a moment
shouted the lieutenant limber up
and follow the wagon i think miss
brown we have checked them a little
but now i must take a look ahead for
it is long since i have been this way

  on rode the leader followed by a
squad of his men the pass was grow-
ing momentarily more narrow and diffi-
cult but that was in their favor for

it gave an opportunity for a few men
to check an army the higher the
rocks on either hand and the more
closely they drew together the lighter
grew the heart of john dean a few
minutes riding brought him out into a
wider and more open space where the
perpendicular side walls arose for hun-
dreds of feet around a couple of acres
of flat rock which seemed be at the
summit of the pass and from which the
gorge sloped downward on the eastern
side at the mouth of this however
the lieutenant paused and listened for a
moment a chorus of strange sounds
from below smote louder and clearer
upon his ears he called out to his
men

  they have seized the eastern end
of the pass we are caught in a trap
quick we must throw up a barri-
cade 

  when the foremost wagon was drawn
into the open space the lieutenant and
his men were already rolling huge frag-
ments of rock across the eastern out-
let to raise a breastwork against any
foeman from beyond

  quick he shouted again they
will be on us in five minutes

  but the wily savages felt too sure of
their prey and knew too well the danger-
ous character of the pass to be in too
great a hurry there was time enough
given for the whole train to pass in and
for the howitzer to take its position
like a watchdog looking back upon the
foes who were to follow a few cold
stern sentences even while the lips that
uttered them quivered with pity con-
veyed lieutenant deans explanations
of their new peril to mrs brown and
her daughter and while the blood in
their veins seemed curdling they could
not help admiring the unfaltering sol-
dier who gave them the news

  the very halt of the train told the
savages on either side all they wanted
to know of each others position and
their further dispositions for the attack

were speedily made they were in no
hurry and yet they had no time to lose
for the day was passing and fort berry
was not so far away

  after a brief breathing space of
which the white men made the best use
in their power the redskin braves no
longer on horseback came rushing up
the ascent toward the frail breastwork
of deans little company not charging
shoulder to shoulder like trained sol-
diers but a horde of yelling blood-
thirsty demons darting from rock to
rock and shelter to shelter stopping to
load and fire and neutralizing as far
as they could the advantages of the
white mens position

  hard-worked was the little howitzer
and the gorges of the hills echoed and
reechoed with the varied sounds of the
desperate struggle again and again
the blackfeet seemed to have all but
carried the frail defenses and as often
they wtere forced to fall back with
greater loss than the red men of the
plains will generally stand up under
but deans powder-blackened face grew
more and more gloomy even with his
success he had been in the front of
every danger and neither annie nor
her mother had received more than a
passing word of encouragement

  we cant stand much more of this
he muttered the ammunition for the
howitzer is almost gone and a good
half of us are either killed or wounded
even as he spoke however a new
phase of the singular combat was draw-
ing nearer and nearer

chapter vi

a fierce struggle

ward the eastern end of the pass
the cavalry squad under captain
montrose were riding swiftly already
made aware that they were needed by
the distant roar of the howitzer while
on the western side of the hills geary
and ragged hand already had the val-
fort extra



ley below the pass and were pressing
steadily upward not even yet were
the blackfeet outnumbered but their
desperate position their unexpected
tumble into their own trap drove them
almost mad with wrath and fear

  one rush was made down the valley
and terrible was their collision with
gearys veterans and the pawnees a
brief fierce struggle and then they
once more turned to the narrow pass
as their only hope their fellows on
the eastern side had only needed to
hear the music of the cavalry bugler
before a precisely similar thought and
purpose seized upon them and they
too in a desperate panic-stricken mass
came pouring forward upon what re-
mained of deans little garrison

  short was the struggle at the bar-
riers for the white men were too few
and the blackfeet charged with the
very recklessness of stampeded cattle

  back shouted the lieutenant
back to the wagons

  the wagons had been drawn up near
each other on one side of the open
space and between them as a place of
safety the women had been stationed
less than a dozen men were able to obey
their leader and in a jiffy the rocky
level swarmed with painted warriors
dean was puzzled for a moment for
the blackfeet at first made no attack
upon his last forlorn position but as
the two bands met and mingled they
shouted to one another with wild and
strange gesticulations that moment
was enough however and then with
the instinctive ferocity of cornered
wolves the red men turned upon their
nearest foes

  down went soldier after soldier
twice dean himself was down but as
often he sprang to his feet again bleed-
ing and half blind but resolute down
too were many of the red men but it
was well for annie brown and her
mother that geary and the pawnee
chief had followed so closely on the

heels of their first advantage annie
prepared to meet her fate bravely while
just in front of her dean was strug-
gling with a black foot brave one ter-
rible moment and then despite the din
of battle she heard her mothers voice
crying

  annie look we are saved

  still the rocky open swarmed with
yelling and struggling men white men
and red fought madly but they seemed
to have no thought of harming her or
her mother and then she saw them
all pouring out together through the
eastern outlet of the pass the few
white men left were saved but that
surging tide of flight and pursuit came
very near being the destruction of cap-
tain montrose and his gallant cavalry
the captain made as good a stand as
he could and took a heavy toll from
the diminished number of the blackfeet
they seemed to go through around over
his slender lines too badly panic-
stricken even to be afraid of them
montrose felt his horse totter and sink
under him from a lance thrust of a
passing brave and he came to the
ground

  all was over in a flash as it seemed
and then montrose pushed forward in
breathless haste to seek tmings of the
colonels daughter it was not long be-
fore he obtained even more than he
could have hoped for while the paw-
nees went on after scalps geary and
montrose as if with one purpose and
one hope met in front of the wagon
in the little rocky arena there be-
fore them was the colonels wife and
there was annie herself but both were
kneeling on the ground as if unmind-
ful of any other presence while upon
the lap of the latter there lay the blood-
stained head of a man in the uniform
of an army officer

  mother said annie her eyes alight
with joy he is alive

  thank heaven for that exclaimed
mrs brown

  and when one of the men who had
a surgeons trained eye had examined
the lieutenants wound he pronounced
it far from mortal it proved a sound
diagnosis for in due time dean him-
self was able to make a report of the
battle in the pass to colonel brown
he tried to give geary and captain
montrose most of the credit but they
would not have it that way and annie
joined him in praises of the splendid
work done by the rescuers not forget-
ting ragged hand

  that night over their pipes at mess
geary said to montrose captain he
gave us all the honors of war

  and thats all well get muttered
the other admirer of miss brown

  oh no returned geary with a re-
signed grin well get an invitation
to the wedding

got it literally

a n amusing incident took place the
other day in a large railway freight
yard a new man was sent to unload a
car and to check the list of contents
he did the work but forgot to fill in
the number of the car in its place on
the form

  go and get me the number of that
car shouted the boss angrily

  the man departed and returned
after an absence of half an hour when
he banged down the cast-iron number
wrenched from the side of the wagon
remarking

  sure the next time ye want the
number of a car ye can go for it yer-
self

slight misunderstanding

a story is being told of a couple
of tourists in spain who could not
speak the language and consequently
had some difficulty in making known
their wants

  one day they came to a wayside inn
and tried to obtain some meat-roast

beef for choice but nobody could un-
derstand them

  what are we to do asked one of
them despairingly

  i know said the other a ray of
hope appearing ill draw a picture of
a cow then theyll understand

  he made a rough sketch of a cow
put a  beneath it and handed it to
the waiter who instantly smiled to show
that he understood and went off to
execute their order

  a few minutes later he returned with
two tickets for a local bullfight

   no doubt about that
furing the course of a conversa-
tion between two gentlemen one
of them declared that he had been hav-
ing electric-light baths up to  de-
grees fahrenheit

  come come george the other
protested thats rather steep why
water boils at  degrees fahrenheit
but i tell you ive been lying in the
electric-light bath with a temperature
of  degrees repeated george

  well well replied his friend
have it your own way but at any
rate youre lying in broad daylight
now

just as ignorant

an admiral was visiting the navy yard
one day when a dispatch was
handed to him his eyes were giving
trouble just at that time and when he
fumbled for his eyeglasses he found
that he had mislaid them he held the
paper close up to his eyes and then
some distance away but he could not
read it either way

  he turned to a sailor of irish birth
who was standing near

read this for me my man he said

  the man shook his head oi cant
he replied oim as ignorant as yer-
self sorr

mystery with two ms

hen the five oclock train
groaned to a halt before the
red-and-white spick-and-span
station at cuttyville twelve
men stepped from the con-
fines of the cindery day coach and
gathered in a knot on the brick-paved
platform between them there fol-
lowed much whispering many askant
glances and a laugh or two then
after the train had pulled out and the
baggage truck had rattled past the
men moved silently and in close forma-
tion across the platform through the
station and out upon the green-bor-
dered walk that led up to the main
street

  take you right up to the american
house gentlemen sang out the alert
bus driver flipping open the door of
the cumbersome vehicle and smiling his
cuttyville best take you right to the
door for two bits a head gentlemen
the gentlemen addressed bestowed
indifferent glances upon the solicitor
turned their backs and continued on
their way

  the driver slammed shut the bus
door a cheap outfit he remarked
in a disgruntled tone

  looks like a jury out for supper
said one of the station loungers who
had witnessed the humiliating incident

  maybe theyre a show troupe an-
other man suggested

  naw the driver replied positively
climbing to his lofty seat and prepar-
ing to pilot his empty craft back to the
hotel  taint no show troupe
there aint no women with em

  questioning stares followed the
twelve men as they proceeded along
the main street in front of the hotel
theypaused as if by some preconcerted
signal then the leader of the crowd
swung abruptly on his heel and strode
into the lobby the other eleven follow-
ing him in single file

  the chair warmers in the lobby were
instantly galvanized into life the bell
boys jumped to attention the clerk
looked up through his glasses extended
an inked pen and reversed the reg-
ister

  one after another the men attached
their signatures to the ink-spattered
page then stepped silently aside and


top-notch magazine

looked to their leader to make the first
move

 how many rooms mr-vance
the clerk inquired glancing at the first
man on the list and taking it for
granted that the man addressed was
in charge of the party

  three large rooms please an-
swered mr vance with two double
beds in each

  the clerk nodded i can fix you
up comfortably front boy how
about your baggage he added

  everything is at the station here
are the checks kindly have it brought
up at once

 right away mr vance the
clerk turning toward his key rack was
visibly impressed by the prospective
guests voice and manner going to
be with us for some time

  vance flashed a quick and significant
glance toward his companions and
checked what might have been a smile
not if i can help it he declared

  the clerk laughed merely to be
agreeable oh i dont know cutty-
ville isnt so bad ive been here for
ten years

  the twelve men in charge of the two
bell boys who comprised the entire
staff ascended the broad carpeted stairs
and were lost to view of the interested
audience in the lobby at once there
was a rush to inspect the register the
names were hurriedly scanned re-
peated and speculated upon

  who are they kohler came from
several lips at once

  dont know the clerk returned
shortly but theyre smart-looking boys
and thems the kind we like to cater
to

  huh put in a hatchet-faced chap
youd better be sure theyve got
enough to pay for their keep if i

was you-

  well do all the worrying kohler
interrupted

  an hour later the baggage arrived

and was taken to the rooms follow-
ing that event the new guests came
down into the lobby singly and in pairs
they exchanged no words except among
themselves several of them hesitated
in front of the cigar counter and gazed
hungrily at the wares displayed then
passed on this unexpected behavior
brought a frown to the face of the
news-stand clerk

  what do you know about that he
muttered not even a picture post
card or a chicago paper wanted

  the editor of the cuttyville bugle
who always managed to be on the job
when anything of interest was break-
ing trailed vance persistently finally
he cornered his quarry

  i represent the bugle mr vance
he began pleasantly anything youd
like to say

vance broke away quickly his face
clouding nothing to say thank you
you and your associates intend to
remain in cuttyville here on busi-
ness are you what line

 vance continued to back away
nothing to say he repeated noth-
ing at all

  but surely mr vance-

  when i want to talk for publica-
tion ill let you know vance inter-
rupted

  queer duck muttered the editor
as his prey escaped him whats he
up to i wonder what can he and
eleven other chaps want in cuttyville
a bell rang loudly the head wait-
ress in freshly starched linen opened
the big doors of the dining room and
put out a bowl of toothpicks she was
nearly swept off her feet in the rush
that followed the twelve new arrivals
were not among the last to engage in
the assault

  the editor looked on and smiled
guess vance was too hungry to talk
he observed ill wait maybe after
supper hell loosen up

  herman wingfield proprietor of the
in the jitney class



hotel came in at that moment and
walked behind the desk his sharp
eyes alighted upon the register

  all in from the evening train
kohler he inquired

  the clerk nodded yes-the whole
twelve

  any baggage

  no trunks--only suit cases and
grips

  they cant be show people wing-
field said the opera house is closed
for the summer

  i didnt think so either kohler
returned until i saw the rush they
made for the dining room

  this comedy line was lost upon the
proprietor of the american house he
took down the pass-key and started
away ill go up and look things
over he said unable to restrain his
curiosity

  he came down the stairs a few min-
utes later still puzzled

  what did you find  asked kohler
theres not much else in their bag-
gage except a lot of baseball fixings
the proprietor announced

  baseball echoed the astonished
clerk well i want to know

  baseball echoed one other who
was leaning over the desk at the time
and who overheard well i guessed
as much 

  kohler turned to face the speaker-
scanlon scanlon had arrived at the
hotel the day before his business was
unknown he was a stocky square-
shouldered ruddy-faced individual who
wore a fancy waistcoat and a big dia-
mond in his shirt front

  know any of the men mr scan-
lon the proprietor inquired

  havent had a good look at them
yet scanlon replied but more than
likely i do i spotted them for base-
ball chaps the minute they came into
the lobby

  what do you suppose they are do-
ing here 

  cant say maybe on their way
east stopping off in cuttyville for a
rest

 but they havent much bag-
gage- began wingfield

  oh probably their trunks went
straight through scanlon said

  i guess thats just abovit what hap-
pened agreed the proprietor of the
american house

  scanlon waited until he could speak
with the proprietor alone he found
his opportunity half an hour later when
the clerk went in to supper

  you say you found a lot of base-
ball uniforms wingfield he in-
quired

  plenty of them

  what color

  a sort of dark red

  did you notice any lettering on
them

  yes big white letters-m m

  scanlon drew in a quick breath and
his eyes twinkled two ms eh by
jove

  wingfield looked up swiftly what
do you mean he inquired

  fll tell you later on said scanlon
and walked hurriedly away

  wingfield stared after him then
slowly shook his head and turned his
attention to his books

chapter ii

guesses and hints

iohler the clerk on his way from
the desk to the dining room let
fall the first hint by the time he had
taken up his usual position at the table
nearest the door every one in the lobby
and half the occupants of the dining
room heard the report

  the news traveled with miraculous
speed the magic word-baseball-
found an echo in almost every cutty-
ville heart for cuttyville it must be
known in proportion to its population


top-notch magazine

had new york lashed to the mast when
it came to baseball

  the local team picked from the rep-
resentative firms of the town played
every saturday afternoon-played and
invariably won not a team in all the
surrounding territory could hold a can-
dle to the cuttyville aggregation in
hitting base running and fielding for
three successive years they had won
the wayne county championship in
the loyal eyes of the local fans the
colts as they were affectionately
termed were on a par with any organi-
zation in the big leagues there was
but one regret-a regret long before
expressed by a mr alexander the
colts had no more worlds to conquer

  out of the hotel the rumor drifted
it winged a course up and down the
streets as swiftly and as surely as the
wireless an unknown ball team un-
doubtedly professionals had come in
on the five oclock train and was quar-
tered at the american house who
they were and what they were doing
or intended to do in cuttyville remained
a mystery yet it was just that one
touch of mystery that made the situa-
tion all the more interesting

  not one of the members would be
interviewed they smiled pleasantly
enough and were ready to talk upon
any subject-except one they were
willing to admit that the weather was
fine that cuttyville had a future that
the railroad station was attractive and
that the war in europe was a bad
thing but they refused to talk base-
ball

  the editor of the bugle remained
hopefully in the lobby trusting to hear
a word that would give his paper an
interesting paragraph but the word
he listened for did not materialize the
twelve attractive men might as well
have been deaf and dumb for all the
news they imparted the rumors per-
sisted but they were yet to be verified
like most editors-popular opinion to

the contrary-he wanted to be sure of
his ground before printing his story

  the clerk at the cigar stand among
the first to hear the report beckoned
to a friend and confided in him im
wise now he said sagely the boys
are in training-thats why they are
not smoking

  the friend nodded youre just
about right

  wonder if they are a big team
the names on the register arent
familiar to me the other returned
and ive heard of all the big-league
fellows

  the clerks right eyelid drooped
meaningly thats to be expected he
said these fellows have stopped off
here for a little rest and they dont
want to be annoyed they havent
signed their own names

  the friend nodded again theres
a whole lot in that too he admitted
i wish i knew for sure

  scanlon smoking his second cigar
his hands deep in his pockets and dis-
playing his fancy waistcoat to the best
advantage eyed the twelve men nar-
rowly as they strolled out of the dining
room then he singled out vance who
appeared to be in charge of the un-
knowns and tried to strike up a con-
versation

  your crowd looks mighty familiar
to me he began what brought you
to this burg

  vance gave the speaker a careful and
critical inspection i dont exactly un-
derstand you he said you mean-
weve met before now

  youve got the whole town guess-
ing scanlon remarked cuttyville is
crazy about baseball i suppose you
know that

  its a great game vance replied
with a smile

  scanlon chuckled say youre a
grand little kidder you are better be
careful or youll be telling me your real
in the jitney class



name what are you up to why all
the mystery

  vance gazed straight at the diamond
in the others shirt front the mys-
tery seems to be all on your part my
friend he said evasively

  oh come now protested scanlon
you can fool some of these cuttyville
sports but i hail from somewhere east
of ohio ive seen you before and all
your bunch as well whats in the
wind

  thats just what i would like to
find out vance returned quickly and
when youve found out let me know
will you

  vance walked away and scanlon did
not attempt to follow him he re-
mained in the center of the lobby rock-
ing up and down on his heels and toes
his forehead wrinkled suddenly his
frown cleared his teeth set grimly upon
his half-smoked cigar

  m m he repeated over to him-
self remembering the letters the hotel
proprietor had found upon the baseball
uniforms great guns why didnt
t think of it before

  an instant later he sidled up to the
cigar stand where the clerk was in
eager conversation with the editor of
the bugle theres something stir-
ring  in cuttyville all right he an-
nounced when murphys marauders
stop off

  whats that  exclaimed the editor
sharply whirling to face the speaker
murphys marauders that bunch
surest thing you know answered
scanlon ive just been talking to
murphy of course he didnt own up
in so many words-but i was on

  the astounded clerk gasped and his
eyes widened is that a fact he
asked are you sure

  i piped em off when they came up
the street to-day scanlon went on
easily knew em right away i saw
the bunch in action one day last month

in omaha theyre a scrappy crowd
all right

  the editor pushed back his hat and
mopped his forehead he was well ac-
quainted with the marvelous exploits
of the marauders-as was every one
who followed the baseball columns in
the middle west papers

  murphys team was an aggregation
of free-lance players many of them
contract jumpers from organized base-
ball they had been giving exhibitions
through the mississippi valley states
on their way to florida where a winter
schedule was booked their spectacu-
lar playing their phenomenal tricks and
their slashing winning stride were as
familiar-on paper-to the fans of
cuttyville as the signboards on main
street

  thats straight is it the editor in-
quired at last as the shock wore off
and he recovered his voice

  straight as a ruler scanlon de-
clared the dope will be out to-mor-
row wait and see i dont know why
murphy is keeping things under cover
-something unusual for him he has
always been a great publicity booster
you know thatswhat made his bunch
famous he loves printers ink every
week or two he digs into organized
baseball and tells a few of the big man-
agers where they can get off the
sporting editors are always willing to
give him a notice from a stickful to a
spread head i dont know whats
come over him all of a sudden hes
tighter than a clam when i mentioned
baseball just a minute ago he gave me
the baby stare

  looks as if he wanted to lay low
for some reason or other remarked
the clerk maybe some of his base-
ball enemies-

  murphy isnt afraid of his enemies
promptly declared scanlon hell give
them a fight anywhere and at any time
hes a clean steady chap murphy is
and as fair-minded as you make em


top-notch magazine

ill bet you any one of the big-league
managers would like to sign him he
pitched for the browns you know
three years ago then his arm went
lame and he took to umpiring with the
outlaws on the pacific coast of course
that queered him in the east

  i believe theyre booked to play a
game in bedford some time next week
said the editor bedford was two hun-
dred miles south of cuttyville some
of the boys intend to run down and
take in the fun

  thats right said scanlon id
forgotten all about it theyre booked
for bedford next tuesday

  i would like to be sure about these
chaps the editor said after a pause
it would make an interesting story
a crackajack scanlon exclaimed
mysterious ball players arrive in cut-
ty ville  refuse to be interviewed 
supposed to be murphys marauders
itll be a corker

  but theres nothing certain- be-
gan the editor

  take my word for it scanlon broke
in i know these twelve chaps are
murphys crowd thats as certain as
im standing here im giving it to you
straight

chapter iii 

a dozen reasons why

vn the following morning several
interesting things came to pass
the cuttyville ibugle on the streets at
seven oclock backed up all the rumors
that had been afloat the night before
and while the paragraph displayed
prominently on the first page next to
gordons pool room advertisment was
a trifle vague and noncommittal and
left the readers to form their own con-
clusions the questions advanced were
not difficult to solve

  scanlon down in the lobby before
eight oclock read the item through with
a chuckle that editor knows his
business all right he observed

 the paragraph headed sport
notes read

  among yesterdays arrivals at the ameri-
can house was a hunch of twelve stalwart
young men in charge of mr vance con-
siderable mystery surrounds them and ru-
mors are plentiful mr vance refused to
give the representative of the bugle any in-
formation one of the bell boys at the ho-
tel however discovered a number of base-
ball uniforms in the rooms occupied by the
strangers the uniforms were dark red and
bore the letters m m on the shirts what
these letters stand for in the realm of base-
ball is only too well known to sport fans

  the hotel lobby was thronged that
morning and so was the street in front
of the house the head waitress and
the smiling girls in her charge were
more than pleasant to the twelve hun-
gry strangers who came down to break-
fast at nine oclock the fact that they
left no tips did not condemn them

  when vance came out of the dining
room and looked about him he frowned
quickly and edged his way to the desk
whats all the excitement this morn-
ing he asked of kohler

  the clerk merely grinned

  something unusual going on in
town vance continued

  yes sir kohler admitted some-
thing very unusual anything i can
do for you sir

  vance was on the point of asking
another question when mr wingfield
proprietor of the hotel stepped into
view

  ah good morning mr vance he
cried extending his hand and smiling
cordially i hope you rested well
rooms o k are they if not ill
change them right away

  everythings all right thank you
vance replied i was just inquiring
of the clerk as to the nature of the ex-
citement he said-

  wingfield interrupted witli a laugh
you cant blame the boys he de-
clared cuttyville is a great baseball
town-for its size
in the jitney class



 vance turned away a crowd of
chattering inquisitive boys were lined
up before the lobby windows peering
through and making shrill comments
until forced to retreat by the hotel por-
ter armed with a hose

  scanlon who had not allowed vance
out of his sight pushed his way
through the crowd vance had just
turned toward the rear stairway intent
upon reaching his room

  just a minute mr vance scanlon
began tapping the others shoulder

  vance looked around to behold his
inquisitor of the previous night his
face clouded what do you want
he asked rather curtly

  you gave me to understand last
night that if i found out what was in
the wind-that was the exact expres-
sion i believe-i was to impart the in-
formation to you am i right

  i said something to that effect
vance replied slowly

  if youll give me five minutes of
your time ill explain scanlon said
im sure youll be interested

  go ahead im listening

  not here scanlon hurriedly pro-
tested i dont want to take the whole
lobby into my confidence suppose you
come up to my room its just at the
head of the stairs

  vance hesitated a minute is the
matter of such importance

  to you yes scanlon returned
and to your advantage as well
since you put it that way vance
answered im interested

  scanlon started up the stairs vance
following him once inside the room
scanlon motioned his guest to be
seated while he stepped over to the
window and pulled up the shade
vance sank into the chair nearest the
door and waited expectantly scanlon
thrust his hands deep into his trouser
pockets and faced the younger man
with a widening smile

ca

  vance he said at last i take it
that the minstrel business is on the de-
cline am i right

  vance was taken by surprise how
did you reach that conclusion he
asked

  well i told you last night that your
bunch looked mighty familiar to me
didnt i i couldnt place you just
then but the whole thing is perfectly
clear to me now last week-friday
to be exact-i saw you and your com-
pany parading up main street in bea-
con center dressed in long red coats
and white high hats get me

  vance nodded go on

  i also witnessed the little entertain-
ment you pulled oft in the opera house
that same night the mammoth metro-
politan minstrels  three special cars 
a hundred people six end men
scanlon laughed youll pardon me
vance but the show was pretty punk
that old gag about the chicken cross-
ing the street for instance-

  i didnt come here to listen to criti-
cism of past performances vance in-
terposed sharply the metropolitan
minstrels have met with hard luck its
members are now at liberty and the

one thing we are hoping for-

  is to get back to new york scan-
lon broke in thats it isnt it
vance

  vance nodded exactly

  where is your baggage and scen-
ery

  ask the proprietor of the opera
house in mason city he attached al-
most everything two nights ago we
managed to get away with our first-act
costumes and our street clothes

  scanlon smiled sympathetically i
understand i know just how you feel
too why i used to be in the business
myself-burlesque was my line thats
why im going to help you fellows
im going to put you on the soft
cushions and send you back to the white
lights whatll it cost


top-notch magazine

  the fare from here to new york
is eighteen  dollars vance said
multiply that by twelve and you have
the answer

  two hundred and sixteen dollars
announced scanlon doing a bit of men-
tal arithmetic not counting sleepers
or meals

  it was vance who smiled now a
day coach and a sandwich or two he
suggested thats plenty i wouldnt
know how to behave in a pullman
bad as all that well you must
have had a beautiful season

  some one told me that summer min-
strels would make a hit in this section
of the country said vance

  whoever it was deserves to be shot
at sunrise was scanlons rejoinder
about all the inhabitants in this sec-
tion care for at the present time is
baseball

  i suspected -as much confessed
vance thats why i used a grand-
stand drop in the first act and rigged
the company out in baseball togs
wanted to have a novelty then i tried
to work up some interest and adver-
tising by organizing a team and play-
ing the local boys in the towns we
showed in the people came to the
games all right enough but they didnt
come to the theater

  scanlon nodded you should have
reversed the order of things you
should have given your minstrel show
to advertise your ball games that
wrould get em do you know vance
he added seriously now whats hap-
pened in cuttyville since you and your
crowd registered at this hotel 

  i can imagine what will happen if
we cant arrange some kind of an en-
tertainment to square our hotel bill
vance replied gloomily

  so thats what you intended to do
is it

  i was about to break the news gently
to the proprietor this morning i was
too tired and hungry last night to take

a chance of being turned down i
warned all the men to keep mum until
i could get a line on the situation

  well the situation has made itself
vance scanlon declared and youve
tumbled into the finest sort of a wel-
come by this time next week youll
be back on broadway warming the
chairs in the booking offices just read
this and scanlon thrust a copy of
the bugle into the actor-managers
hands

  vance read the paragraph through
twice before he looked up then he
smiled but scanlon gave him no time
to speak

  its the luckiest thing that ever hap-
pened to you vance he cried your
bunch has been spotted for a baseball
outfit-and murphys team at that
now its up to you to take advantage
of the mistake and pick up enough coin
to take you out of town

  so that is why every one in the lobby
talked baseball to me is it i couldnt
understand at first

  well you do now scanlon re-
turned ive boosted things along
ive done the press-agent stuff to a
fare-you-well i tipped off the editor
of the bugle and helped matters along
with the proprietor of the hotel all
you and your crowd have to do now
is to look wise and say nothing the
more mysterious you act the better it
will go

  i suppose the finding of those base-
ball uniforms in our hand baggage
started the ball rolling said vance

  it certainly did scanlon replied
with a chuckle you see the letters
m m stand for murphys marauders
as well as metropolitan minstrels

  ive heard a great deal concerning
the marauders vance admitted after
a pause pretty good team arent
they

 good why theyre immense
the greatest bunch of outlaws in the
business
in the jitney class	

  then you suggest that we pose as
the marauders play the local team and
use our share of the gate receipts to
carry us back to new york thats
your proposition isnt it

  exactly said scanlon beaming

       chapter iv
       mums the word

wance shook his head dubiously

     i dont know about that he re-
marked without the enthusiasm the
other had expected the playing of
the ball game is all right but to rep-
resent ourselves as the marauders
when we are not isnt just the proposi-
tion to appeal to me

  oh forget the proprieties youre
after the coin this is no time to split
hairs

  we need the money vance said
quietly but we must raise it legiti-
mately i appreciate the spirit in which
the suggestion was made he went on
please remember that your plan
sounds attractive and feasible-until
one stops to analyze it

  wheres the flaw in it

  were not ball players to begin
with and the local players are when
it comes to baseball were in the jitney
class theyd show us up before the
game was half over

  show you up scoffed the other
say who do you think youre to play 
the athletics the boston braves
rubbish youre going up against the
cuttyville colts and theyre a typical
bunch of small-town bushers now
you fellows have been playing a few
games this summer havent you 
youre in fair trim you can put up
a decent scrap and it doesnt make
any difference whether you win or lose
or draw-half of the gate receipts are
yours just the same its a sure thing
any way you want to look at it

we did put up some scrappy ball
this summer said vance his eyes

kindling most of the boys are fair
players fact is they would rather
play ball than eat ive been twirling
for the crowd theres nothing phe-
nomenal in my delivery of course
but-

  thats the spirit scanlon broke in
show em what youve got youve
nothing to be afraid of vance you
wont come right out and say youre
murphy or that your bunch are the
marauders but every one in town will
take it for granted the rumor has
taken hold and it wont be downed
its up to you to look wise and let
the crowd form their own conclusions
you can play under some other name
call yourselves the reds if you want
the more mystery the better the gate
receipts ought to total a thousand dol-
lars at the very least-and five hundred
of it will be in your pocket an hour
after the game is over and say
vance he added lowering his voice
wont those lights in times square look
good to you

  vance drew in a quick breath for
three months he and his companions
had been wildcatting through the one-
night stands of the middle west fight-
ing for time parading giving concerts
hanging their own stuff sleeping in day
coaches when they slept at all and eat-
ing from lunch counters when they were
fortunate enough to have the where-
withal and as a reward for the hard-
ships and the hundred nights of ex-
pectation the sheriff had appeared upon
the scene-as sheriffs are in the habit
of doing

  vance himself by pawning a ring
had defrayed the expenses of the de-
funct minstrel company from mason
city to cuttyville in hope that the lat-
ter town would be more kindly dis-
posed toward a benefit performance
in view of that he had put up at the
hotel and intended to have a heart-
to-heart talk with the proprietor after
a nights rest and a square meal

  tm in sympathy with you chaps
scanlon went on earnestly i know
what it means to be stranded a thou-
sand miles from new york that is
the reason im ready to help you along
guess i forgot to introduce myself
didnt i youll pardon me my
names scanlon and i hail from some-
where north of thirty-fourth street
my names vance as you already
know the actor responded complet-
ing the delayed introduction from the
same district

  well what have you got to say
do you think the local boys would
play with us said vance absently his
mind still dwelling on the question of
whether he would lend himself to the
deception that scanlon had proposed

  would you accept thirty weeks on
broadway why say vance these
cuttyville colts will be delirious with
joy at the mere prospect of meeting
your crowd theyre a cocksure chesty
crowd and because theyve licked a few
of their bush-league rivals they think
they can clean up anything that wears
a uniform and as for the inhabitants
-take it from me vance theyll pawn
their shoes to get into the bleachers
forget the ifs ands and buts put the
proposition up to the other boys wont
you just see how they take it
vance allowed himself to be won
over on that point and within ten min-
utes after the word had been passed
around the eleven wondering members
of the late metropolitan minstrels gath-
ered in vances room there scanlon
explained his plan in very few words

  its the chance of a lifetime boys
he finished and im with you to the
last if the game goes on to-morrow
afternoon-saturday-you will have
the rest of to-day and to-morrow morn-
ing to limber up in thats time enough
isnt it

  plenty chorused several voices at
once the decision of the eleven men
was never in doubt from that time on

the mere thought of getting back to
new york blinded them to everything
else vance listened to their shouts in
silence

  what about our side props one
of the men broke in suddenly we
havent a glove or bat-

  the colts will be tickled to death
to accommodate you scanlon inter-
rupted smiling

  bayley who was the featured end
man of the company-when it was in
existence-and who formed the receiv-
ing end of the battery with vance
when the company was displaying its
baseball talents executed a jig taking
it for granted of course that the actor-
manager was in favor of the proposed
match

  bring on the colts he cried
well break them to harness vance
and i will have them eating out of our
hands before the third inning were
no good actors but were some bat-
tery

  aldred who had been the metropol-
itan minstrels leading tenor who
doubled in brass without a whimper
and who held down the initial sack on
the team broke in with a query
you fellows dont think youve a
chance to win this game do you 

  we should worry returned bay-
ley

  win or lose you all go back to
broadway chimed in scanlon thats
the thing that counts

  wonder if the old street is still
there 

  ill take a chance on finding it if i
get back said lynch

  im as well off here as in new
york gloomily declared keen once
billed as the most marvelous basso in
minstreldom

  well leave you here if you feel
like that said bayley

  oh see the pretty lights boys
lynch broke in cant you just see
in the jitney class



em twinkling cant you sniff the fra-
grance of the dear old subway

  the crowd laughed scanlon joined
in the levity nice soft pullman
cushions all the way to jersey city
boys are you for em 

  foolish question number nine hun-
dred aqd thirty cried conner soft-
shoe dancer comedian and second
basemfn

  all right scanlon returned well
start the ball a rolling weve no time
to lose you boys had better scatter
and keep mum your manager will do
all the talking necessary see you
later

  he hurried out of the room and down
the hall before vance who was stand-
ing thoughtfully at thewindow could
call to him

chapter v

tipping off cuttyville

earing the smile of a man to
whom all the world is rosy scan-
lon slipped down the rear stairs pushed
his way into the american house bar
treated himself to a liberal drink ex-
changed a word or two with the re-
freshment dispenser in regard to the
baseball situation-not forgetting to
ring in a reference to murphys ma-
rauders-stepped out again into the
lobby and made his way toward the
desk where wingfield was on duty

  quite lively around here this morn-
ing isnt it he began leaning back
against the desk and burying his hands
in his pockets looks like a real ho-
tel it surely does

  wingfield looked across the lobby
and smiled youve heard the news
havent you that crowd upstairs is
murphys team

  scanlon eyed him speculatively
how did you find it out he asked
with marked emphasis on the pronoun

  oh im not blind i knew all along
they were baseball chaps but i couldnt

understand why they were stopping off
here and why they didnt want to be
recognized im still guessing

  murphys a queer duck observed
scanlon theres no telling whats up
his sleeve

  well he might as well own up now
wingfield replied we know who he
is he couldnt fool the cuttyville
people

  scanlon grinned admiringly i
guess youre right youve got a pretty
wise bunch in this town nothing gets
past them eh i only hope murphy

doesnt blame me for-

  blame you wingfield interrupted
what do you mean by that

  scanlon looked chagrined and cleared
his throat embarrassedly it was a suc-
cessful bit of acting for an amateur
and it had the desired effect upon the
interested and unsuspecting hotel pro-
prietor

  i-i really didnt mean to let that
slip scanlon said confused but
im a poor hand at keeping secrets
dont give me away now wringfield
he hurried on if murphy knew this
he would throw a fit fact of the mat-
ter is i spotted him last night and
recognized him in a minute ive met
him before yovi know while he was
with the st louis browns he got
me to one side and swore me to secrecy
he and his crowd are stopping off here
for a fev days there seems to be
some sort of mix-up in their schedule
-i dont know exactly what it is-but
until the affair is adjusted he intends to
lie low in cuttyville

  the explanation vague and halting
as it was appeared to satisfy wing-
field he nodded i understand he
said of course murphy doesnt want
it generally known that he is stopping
here

  not on your life it might spell
trouble for him of course a few of
the localities are wise but murphy isnt
giving them any satisfaction

how long do you think hell stay
until monday i gathered that
much from his conversation last night
i suppose hell shoot right down to
bedford from here

  wingfield was silent a moment ap-
parently lost in thought then he sud-
denly leaned over and touched scan-
lons shoulder i wonder he broke
out if murphy would play a game
with the colts

  scanlons surprise was genuine he
had expected to lead up to this propo-
sition gradually never believing that
wingfield would make the first ad-
vance but now that the unexpected
had come to pass scanlon skipped the
preliminaries you mean play here
in cuttyville he asked

  yes to-morrow afternoon we can
draw at least fifteen hundred people
i could guarantee murphy five or six
hundred dollars

  scanlon pursed his lips and rubbed
iris chin i dont know about that
he replied slowly you see the ma-
rauders are to play in bedford on
tuesday and the principals down there
might kick theyre counting on a big
cuttyville delegation at the game you
know and if the team appears here it
would cut into the bedford receipts
i understand that the bedford crowd
has put up a guarantee of a thousand
dollars-so it would be mighty poor
policy for murphy to show hre for half
that amount

  i didnt think of that wingfield
said

  but look here scanlon went on
quickly the idea is too good to pass
by possibly you could arrange with
murphy to play you under some other
name understand instead of the
marauders it could be the reds it
would be all the same to you the
crowd is wise

do you think he would agree to
that plan wingfield asked hopefully
go up and tackle him urged scan-

lon he might be willing under
the circumstances to pick up five hun-
dred dollars baseball managers are
only human you know and so long
as it wouldnt get him in bad with the

bedford crowd- scanlon broke

off with a wink see what i mean
by george ill do that declared
wringfield

  for heavens sake dont let on that
ive tipped you ofif warned scanlon
im not to be mentioned in the deal
understand

  you leave that to me i wont get
you in dutch say the manager ran
on enthusiastically a game with that
bunch will be the talk of the town of
course it is likely to be one-sided and
we wont stand much of a chance-
against them but well show em the
best we have

  oh i dont know about that scan-
lon put in even the best of the
teams crack now and then the ma-
rauders have cleaned up everything in
this section of the country but theres
no telling when theyre due to hit the
toboggan

  five minutes after scanlon had de-
livered that remark and had moved
away wingfield hurried up to vances
room once he had been asked to en-
ter he quickly introduced himself and
proceeded to explain the nature of his
business by stating his proposition
clearly and briefly the local team of
which he was the business manager had
an open date for saturday afternoon
would vances nine care to fill in for
a guarantee of five hundred dollars

  vance listened respectfully my
nine he repeated frowning i dont
quite understand im afraid you are
mistaken mr wingfield im not man-
aging a ball team

  wingfield smiled-a very sly and
knowing smile oh thats all right
he protested quickly im not saying
you are a manager but i am under
the impression-and he glanced sig-
in the jitney class



nificantly at the red uniforms upon the
bed-that you and your companions
do play ball occasionally

  so we do-occasionally admitted
vance i cant very well deny that

the evidence is before you but-

  isnt the inducement liberal
enough

  oh it isnt the inducement vance
replied what puzzles me is that you
should name so large a sum were not
professionals you know do you think
our appearance is worth five hundred
dollars

  ill take the chance wingfield said
vance leaned forward in his chair
and the smile that had touched his lips
vanished i hate to spoil your illu-
sions mr wingfield he began quietly
and im not mean enough to take
advantage of your error there are
certain unfounded rumors afloat-you
know what they are-relative to the
identity of my companions and myself
there was also a paragraph in this
mornings paper which to say the least
was absolutely absurd im afraid
youve been impressed by all of this
and-

  the reports have not influenced me
in the slightest the manager protested
hurriedly

  in that case returned vance i
might agree to play i do not care to
make trouble for either of us i dont
want you to be placed in a false light
and i certainly do not want to enter a
contest-to put it literally-wearing an-
other mans colors

  once more wingfield smiled i un-
derstand exactly mr vance you can
be known as the reds is that agree-
able

  vance nodded and the guarantee
-well not consider that he said i
think it would be better to share equally
in the gate receipts whether they
amount to ten dollars or ten hundred
just as you say mr vance

  we have your permission to use the

grounds this afternoon vance went
on to ask we need a little warming
up

  the field is at your disposal

  thank you mr wingfield then
we will consider the matter settled it
is to be the reds against the colts

  the reds against the colts wing-
field repeated his eyes sparkling that
is it exactly mr vance

  when the manager of the cuttyville
colts had departed the door of the ad-
joining room was flung open and half
a dozen ex-members of the minstrel
troupe who had overheard most of the
conversation between vance and the
hotel proprietor raced in they joined
hands and executed a war dance upon
the dingy brussels carpet to them
broadway was just around the corner

  meanwhile wingfield bubbling over
with enthusiasm descended to the lobby
where the first to greet him was scan-
lon

  well scanlon broke forth what
luck 

  the colts will face the reds to-
morrow afternoon announced wing-
field

  say thats immense scanlon cried
simply immense

  wingfield hurried on to spread the
news scanlon slipped away to the
telegraph office where he composed
and handed to the operator a short
queerly worded message it read

minstrel maneuvers

there was no mistaking the cutty-
ville attitude toward the coming
contest once it had become generally
known that the mysterious and uncom-
municative crowd at the american
house was to cross bats with the colts
on saturday afternoon all fandom was
agog excitement ran at fever heat


top-notch

magazine

the usual saturday games where the
colts met the rank and file of the county
leaguers was something to look forward
to but the mere prospect of seeing the
reds in action was an occasion to ex-
cite even the feminine minority it
was slated to be an epoch in cutty-
villes baseball history

  of course every one knew-just as
positively as wingfield himself knew-
who the reds really were murphy
who persisted in the name of vance
for all his bluffing and pretended igno-
rance could not pull the wool over
cuttyville eyes no matter how desper-
ately he tried but so long as the man-
ager had insisted upon rechristening
his team the fans were agreeable for
all they cared he might have called his
outfit the pinks or the blues after
all what mattered what was in a
name  a rose by any other name
would smell as sweet as they often had
heard and the marauders called by any
other name would play ball just as bril-
liantly

  in one respect however the ap-
proaching game was without precedent
cuttyville money was shy the fans
were not disloyal and up to a certain
point maintained perfect confidence in
their team previous to this they had
backed their aggregation heavily and
persistently and had  never cause for
regret but on this occasion the pros-
pect for a victory was not alluring
enough to coax the silver dollars out
of hiding the marauders were too
big too strong too able the colts
would give them a good fight of course
but the result was hardly to be ques-
tioned

  vance and his men went out to the
ball park that afternoon locked the
gates behind them and proceeded to
work the knots out of their muscles
the men were all in high humor and
displayed remarkable dash and enthusi-
asm in the warming-up process vance
was surprised as well as gratified

  theres one thing sure he observed
after the men had slammed his easy
throws to all four corners of the field
you fellows can play ball better than
you can act

  which isnt saying very much re-
marked aldred

  oh well give these colts a scrap
all right bayley declared it isnt
going to be a walk-over for them

  it had better not be a walk-over
vance replied otherwise the crowd
will want their money back

  if they do itll be over my dead
body bayley remarked grimly with
visions of times square dancing before
his eyes

  it all depends upon you vance
lynch spoke up if they hit you hard
in the beginning itll be all over you
cant count on brilliant support from
us that is unless you provide us with
baskets were likely to let a few swift
ones through us

  after vance had framed up a new
batting order to the satisfaction of all
concerned he put his companions
through a brisk fielding practice laying
down easy bunts for the infield to pick
up and lifting out high ones for the
garden men to get under lie kept the
men busy until the button-factory siren
began an unearthly screech giving all
the countrvside notice that five oclock
had arrived the ex-minstrels changed
into their street clothes and hurried
hotelward

  that night while the hotel lobby was
buzzing with comment and speculation
over the coming game scanlon was
seen in earnest conversation with a
slim well-dressed stranger who had
appeared on the scene at four oclock
and who had registered as henry ta-
bor of glen falls

  saturday morning saw another long
practice for the leg-weary and arm-
sore ex-minstrels and persistent coach-
ing from vance who was greatly elated
over the behavior of his men while
in the jitney class



he was not counting upon a victory
over the locals he hoped to give them
a fight in every one of the nine innings
he knew his men would be under a
constant and critical survey from the
moment they appeared upon the field
and that a great deal would be expected
from them if they fell down in the
beginning or blew up before the sev-
enth the crowd would first begin to
wonder then to suspect and that would
mean trouble

  at one-thirty the main street sec-
tion of cuttyville was deserted but the
ball park resembled a miniature polo
grounds during the deciding game of a
worlds series fifteen hundred fans
crowded into the wooden stands that
were never meant to hold a thousand
the band from the button factory
played incessantly if not melodiously

  the reds with vance at their head
trotted across the field from the club-
house to be greeted with cheers and
applause they began their batting
practice and the crowd settled down to
watch them closely

  as the colts appeared and went in
to take their turn at warming up vance
led his men to the bench in the visitors
dugout there he delivered a brief
but earnest lecture after the talk the
ex-minstrels proceeded to size up their
husky opponents

  whew ejaculated bayley as he
watched the colt backstop make two
perfect throws to second look at
that wing will you

  if he keeps that up said aldred
well do mighty little stealing

  who is pitching asked lynch
eying the thin gawky southpaw who
was limbering up his arm looks like
a scarecrow

  thats blackdaw answered vance
holds a record i understand eight
straight victories

  just wait till i get a chance at him
put in lynch grinning ill have him
running to cover in view of the

fact that lynch had not made a safe
hit during the season and held the rec-
ord for strike-outs it was not surpris-
ing that his companions laughed

  the band stopped playing the um-
pire walked out before the grand stand
and announced the batteries the crowd
cheered as the colts trotted out to their
positions blackdaw walked to the
mound

  with the umpires sharp play ball
keen who headed the batting order for
the reds picked up his bat and stepped
briskly to the plate blackdaw sent
over two perfect strikes before keen
realized it then he swung on the
next ball and rolled an easy grounder
to the first baseman bayley up next
hit the first ball pitched and reached
first by a narrow margin but he was
out by six feet when he tried to reach
second on aldreds bunt conner
waited calmly until two and three had
been called on him then he lifted a
weak fly to center

  not so bad for the opening mut-
tered bayley as the colts came racing
in well get to that southpaw in the
next session

  with the reds in the field vance
faced the first cuttyville man whip-
ping over a strike before the batter was
prepared then he threw four straight
balls and the crowd yelled as the batter
ambled to first

  tighten up old man shouted con-
ner pounding his glove

  the next colt in trying to sacrifice
popped up a foul that bayley trapped
the third man bunted successfully and
thanks to lynchs fumble reached first
safely with a man on first and sec-
ond vance wound up slowly and made
the batter swing at a slow one but
the next ball slipped and the batter met
it square on the nose it sailed in a
straight line for reed the surprised
third baseman leaped into the air stuck
up his gloved hand and to the amaze-
ment of the crowd as well as himself

nailed it whirling like a top he threw
to second catching the runner a foot
off the base it was a quick play and
the fans shouted their approval

  as the reds came back to the bench
reed was grinning foolishly

  pure luck he admitted dont
know how i did it

  the second inning produced noth-
ing remarkable vances men came
through with two safe hits but hardy
was caught napping at second lynch
struck out and vance could do noth-
ing better than lift a high foul which
the third baseman by a remarkable
spurt managed to get under

  in the third inning two errors let in
the first colt tally and the excited
fans went wild vance tightened up
after that and struck out the next two
men the reds reached third in the
first half of the fourth inning but could
not score in the last half with two
men down the third batter crashed out
a homer and brought in the second run
by the end of the fifth inning the two
colt runs looked as big as a barn

  ill be satisfied if we can hold them
down to that score said vance as he
took his seat on the bench in the first
of the sixth not so bad for ama-
teurs

  no chance muttered reed we
can hit blackdaw all right but we cant
get around the circuit that backstop
is a marvel wonder what hes doing
out here in the bushes 

  hes nervous put in lynch hand
him out a line of chatter when you go
up next time maybe hell fall for it
the colt catcher did fall for it keen
started in to guy him as he stepped
to the plate he swung wildly at the
third strike the catcher let it go
through him instantly keen shot up
the line to first and was called safe
bayley continuing the same tactics
fouled the first three balls and drove
the next one for a clean single over the
second basemans head with two men

on and nobody down things began to
look encouraging lynch trotted over
to the coaching line

  here goes your old ball game now
he shouted dancing up and down and
waving his long arms here it goes
in spite of his antics which the crowd
enjoyed if the colts didnt the luck
was short-lived conner whiffed on
three wide ones and reed hit into a
double play

  its a long long way to tipperary
some one shouted from the stands and
lynch walking out into the field
scowled

  in the last half of the sixth the colts
managed to squeeze in another run
vance handed a pass to the first man
up who promptly stole second when
bayley let a ball go through him and
scored on a long fly and a hit

  when the reds came in for their
chance at bat vance for the first time
that afternoon caught sight of scan-
lon who occupied a chair in one of
the improvised boxes along with his
friend tabor scanlon gave vance a
sign got up from his chair and dis-
appeared through a door leading under
the stands vance skirted the bleachers
and walked around to meet him

chapter vii

put on the map

vance was passing along the
boarded exit chute he ran into
kohler of the american house

  hello mr vance said the clerk
tough luck isnt it i guess cutty-
ville isnt on the baseball map eh 

  vance smiled the colts are some-
thing to be proud of he admitted
theyre a scrappy bunch

  if i had only known as much this
morning as i do this afternoon said
kohler i might have picked up a lit-
tle loose change the colts werent in
on the betting at all we never thought
they had a chance against the mar-
in the jitney class



against your team he explained grin-
ning at the break he had made no
one thought so-except that chap scan-
lon and his friend

  vances smile vanished as he turned
to face the clerk do you mean that
scanlon and his friend have backed the
colts

  up to the hilt kohler replied
he seemed to think the locals would
have an easy time with you the odds
were five to two ye all thought he
was crazy and covered his money i
put up twenty dollars myself i guess
he had the right dope after all

  a sudden shout rocked the stands
and kohler hurried away toward the
field for fear of missing some of the
evident excitement vance stood look-
ing after him his face set his eyes
clouded in that instant the whole af-
fair was clear to him

  scanlon came down the chute to meet
him smiling broadly his hands as usual
thrust deep into his trouser pockets

  congrats vance he greeted
youre doing fine keep it up i
didnt think you chaps could hold em
down so well he paused surprised
at the steady searching look vance be-
stowed upon him what-what the
deuce is the trouble  he went on

  look here scanlon vance re-
turned sharply have you been backing
the local team

  oh a little there seemed to be
plenty of coin floating around so i
thought i might as well have a look-in
not sore over that are you

  so you took advantage of the cut-
tyville crowd and played a sure thing
did you you framed up this

game-

  framed up nothing scanlon cut
in quickly if the rubes want to bet
on you why should i stop them  i
couldnt explain could i 

  no vance returned evenly you
could not explain i grant that but
you knew who we were you knew we

didnt stand much of a chance against
the colts you shouldnt have bet at
all if i had known this before the
game started i wouldnt have played
what have you got to kick about
scanlon contended hotly thanks to
me and to my little idea you and your
crowd are going back to new york on
the cushions i tipped you off and
made everything easy for you didnt
i  and now youre crying because i
get a little reward for my work im
not roaming the country for my health
vance i saw the opportunity for a
clean-up and i grabbed it its strictly
business with me you fellows arent
suffering youre in clover wthy if
it hadnt been for me youd all be on
your uppers

  im not going to pretend that i did
this just because i felt sorry for your
crowd for i didnt he continued giv-
ing vance no time for further protest
sympathy isnt in my line ive made
the rubes here believe that you are mur-
phy and that your bunch are the ma-
rauders you havent committed your-
self youve played safe so now
that youve heard the dreadful secret

scanlon laughed show me up 
how  going to tell the crowd out

my boy dont try it they wouldnt
appreciate your kindness at the present
time-and its a blamed long walk back
to thirty-fourth street

  how much of the red money have

  oh a few thousand theyre a
royal bunch i guess not-these cutty-
ville sports why i even got a bet on
with wingfield think of that the
colts own business manager he
thought he had a sure thing they all
thought that-a couple of hours ago

top-notch magazine

  i made it clear to wingfield before
i closed with him scanlon that we
werent murphys crowd i did not
want to have any misunderstanding

about-

  why say the more you talked
against it the surer he was broke in
scanlon hes so certain that you are
murphy and that your troupe of min-
strels are the marauders that hed put
up his hotel on a wager he says he
spotted you right away-thinks hes a
sure-enough sherlock when it comes
to solid-ivory domes wingfield gets the
prize

  t never thought of the betting end
of the game when i agreed to the
match vance said i might have
known that your plea of sympathy was
a blind but ive always been on the
square and im not going to fall down
now no matter how badly we need the
money im speaking for every one of
the boys too

  thats all right argued scanlon
youre doing the square thing arent
you you told wingfield the truth
if he doesnt believe you it isnt your
fault all you have to do now is to
keep your mouth shut look wise get
your share of the gate receipts and
board the next train for new york
yes vance returned grimly i can
do all of that but im going to do one
thing you havent counted upon im
going to square myself with cutty-
ville

  hows that

  the reds are going to win the game
this afternoon

  scanlon smiled youre starting in
rather late arent you with a three-
run lead staring you in the face and
with only two more innings to play
youre as good as beaten right now
were not beaten until the last man
is out in the ninth inning said vance
just remember that and while youre
remembering allow me to extend a lit-
tle advice when the games over you

and your friend had better disappear
thats all

  vance turned fighting down all the
resentment he felt toward the self-
confessed crook then walked through
the exit and out upon the field scan-
lon looked after him then laughed nerv-
ously drew a cigar from his pocket and
lighted it	

  it cant be done he muttered be-
tween luxurious puffs at the weed
those ham actors havent a chance
not a chance in the world

nearer home

uhen vance left scanlons pres-
ence and found himself once
more upon the field with the shouting
crowd about him and his companions
still on the bench and at bat his ex-
pression changed

  the seventh inning had dragged
there had been several disputes with
the umpire so keen informed his man-
ager and all of them had been settled
in favor of the colts reed was at
bat and three balls had been called on
him two men were out and bayley
was taking a dangerous lead off third
having reached that port by a long hit
and a colt error

  lynch was on the coaching line re-
lieving his mind of an excess of min-
strel chatter hoping to annoy the colt
twirler hello he broke out as
vance stopped beside him thought
you had been kidnaped youre up
after reed you know i think were
going to start something now weve
got the catcher talking back to us and
thats a good sign

  we must start something vance
declared we nust

  lynch shrugged i guess- we can
prevent em shutting us out that wont
be so bad oh my he shouted sud-
denly as reed dropped his bat and
trotted toward first see that black-
in the jitney class



daw passed him now its up to you
vance

  vance walked grimly to the plate
he had two hits to his credit that aft-
ernoon but unfortunately in both in-
stances there had been no one on bases
the situation was changed now with
reed leading off at first and bayley
dancing nervously about on third a
nicely placed single would mean a tally

  when two balls had been called on
him vance looked over at reed and
jerked the brim of his cap reed un-
derstood the signal vance squared
himself took a fresh grip upon his bat
and swung wildly at the next ball be-
fore it thumped into the catchers mitt
reed was tearing up the line toward
second the colt backstop straightened
swiftly and hurled the ball across the
diamond the crowd shouted fran-
tically as bayley raced home from third
the second baseman had to jump for
the ball and reed slid under him
safely the time-honored double steal
had worked to perfection

  the colt backstop scowled as the
reds guyed him

  cheer up hermie lynch sang
out youll learn to play ball some
day sure you will

  vance let another ball go by him
which the umpire apparently as rattled
as the catcher called a strike watch-
ing blackdaws next wind-up vance
guessed at the throw and guessed right
there was a sharp- crack as the bat
disputed the right of way with the ball

  o-o-oh my yelled lynch

  vance dug his toes into the soft dirt
and raced up the first-base line as
he turned after touching the bag he
saw the left fielder running backward
to get under the ball-and kept on to-
ward second lynch was turning cart-
wheels on the coaching line while reed
was speeding home

  the crowd in the stands silent for
the breathless interval suddenly broke
into a roar by that time vance had

made a perfect slide into the third sack
but the colt third baseman had tossed
away his glove and was running for the
bench

  what do you know about that
cried lynch helping vance upon his
feet the colt speared the ball
speared it with one hand now reeds
tally wont count

  well weve scored on them re-
turned vance that helps some

  the pitcher-manager went into the
box in the last of the seventh grimly
determined to hold down the colts to
the three tallies the first man to face
him struck out while the second fouled
three balls before flying out to keen in
center field the third man smashed a
line drive straight into vances hands
only three men had faced him in that
inning and not one of them had reached
first

  hurrying back to the dugout he gath-
ered his players around him boys
he announced gravely weve got to
win this game if wre dont-he used
scanlons phrase-itll be a long walk
back to thirty-fourth street

  whats the matter lynch inquired
do you mean if we dont win out we
dont get our share of the gate re-
ceipts

  i mean vance explained lowering
his voice that if we lose the game
scanlon will pocket several thousand
dollars of cuttyvilles money this
match was a frame-up on his part the
cuttyville crowd backed us believing us
to be the marauders scanlon was
sure we would lose and covered all bets
now the only way we can square mat-
ters is to buck up and win after that
if explanations are needed well find
friendly ears this is the first of the
eighth lets start things

  the eleven listeners angry in eleven
different ways assured vance they
would do their best

  prospects arent cheerful com-
mented keen as tarbell the first red
	top-notch

                       

up to bat fanned on three pitched balls
unless something busts 

  then something will bust returned
vance

  hardy walked out to the plate al-
lowed two balls to go by him-both
strikes-suddenly remembered what
vance had said and hit for a single
then lynch took his place and hit into
an easy double play retiring the side

  if you had asked us to pick up the
grand stand and carry it across the
street we might do it he said dismally
as yance passed him on the way to the
box but we cant bust this outfit
weve one more chance at bat was
the reply dont forget that

  the last half of the eighth inning
produced neither runs nor thrills and
the crowd in the stands and bleachers
prepared themselves for the final ses-
sion with the score of three to one in
the beginning of the ninth it looked
like a colt victory

  keen heading the reds faced black-
daw with a grin he waited out three
wide throws and then probably re-
membering how alluring the lights were
on broadway smashed into the next
ball for a single

  now we start cried lynch spring-
ing from the bench and hurrying over
to the coaching line now were off
wratch out for a double play bay-
ley vance warned the big catcher as
the latter picked up a bat a nice lit-
tle bunt will do

  bayley smiled bunt not much
double play or not he intended to hit
good and hard perhaps the absolute
confidence that was his at that moment
had something to do with the result
for he swung mightily at the first ball
blackdaw gave him and saw the sphere
sailing like a gray streak over the short-
stops uplifted glove keen reached
second without much effort and by
the time the ball was recovered bayley
was hugging the initial sack and grin-

magazine

ning back at vance as if to say why
bunt when the hittings good

  nobody down nobody down
lynch howled

  as conner came to bat the colt
 catcher walked out into the diamond to
 hold a conference with the pitcher
 when the receiving end of the colt bat-
 tery took up his position again conner
 spoke to him keep alive old sport
 im going to bunt honest i am just
 watch 

   conner kept his word the second
 ball which he barely tapped rolled a
 few feet along the first-base line con-
 ner hesitated as the catcher lunged
 forward to pick it up then he dashed
  ahead the colt backstop was bowled
 over and conner beat out the delayed
 throw

   whoop-e-e shouted lynch ev-
 erybody safe how easy now for
 the fireworks

   with the bases full and no one out
 reed stepped to the plate blackdaw
 was a trifle shaky now and sent over
 three balls in succession before the bat-
 ter found one to his liking then he
 popped up a weak fly that the third
 baseman took care of

   only one gone only one lynch
 announced as vance walked out you
 cant go wrong now

   the crowd in the stands leaned for-
 ward as one man they realized as
 well as the batter that almosj any kind
 of a hit would bring in two runs and
 two runs were all the reds needed to
 even up the score and make a tenth
 inning possible the catcher crouch-
 ing back of the plate fumbled nerv-
 ously at his glove vance looked over
 at scanlon who was sitting on the edge
 of his chair his face strained and wor-
 ried blackdaw wound up slowly and
 sent the first ball across for a strike

   his next two efforts were not so
 good vance fouled the third ball and
 it went for the second strike black-
 daws next offering was so wild that
in the jitney class



the catcher had to jump for it but the
colt backstop held onto the ball and
glared defiantly around at the runners
poised on tiptoe at each corner of the
diamond

  vance drew in a quick breath and
took a fresh grip upon his bat with
two strikes and three balls called on
him he had the colt twirler at a dis-
advantage blackdaw had to put the
next ball over for a strike or force in
a run vance knew it every player on
the field and on the benches knew it
every watcher in the stands knew it

  the batter waited confidently so did
the silent and expectant hundreds in the
stands something had to break-and
quickly that something happened
the ball leaving blackdaws fingers
came down like a streak vance
stepped back and swung with a pistol-
like report the ball sailed into the outer
field vance sped up the first-base line
as if setting a pace for a hundred-yard
dash while the other runners moved
around the diamond like so many au-
tomatons released by a spring

  the colt fielder aware that he could
not catch the ball did all that was pos-
sible for him to do-made a spectacular
leap and with a swing of his gloved
hand knocked down the ball by that
time keen and bayley had galloped
home the fielder recovering the ball
whipped it swiftly to third and con-
ner was tagged out vance remaining
safe on the middle sack

  pandemonium broke loose the oc-
cupants of the stands were turned into
shrieking hysterical gesticulating ma-
niacs with two men out vances
timely hit had tied the score it was up
to vance now to do some quick think-
ing it was tarbells turn at bat but the
uncertain left fielder for the reds had
struck out twice before and vance did
not propose to take chances with him
again at so critical a moment he sig-
naled to lynch who dashed across to
the bench a pinch hitters opportu-

nity was at hand and crocker was the
man to fill the position

chapter ix

spoils of victory

f rocker had given a good account
of himself in the games the ex-
minstrels had staged before and he was
out of the present match only because
of a wrenched knee but he could hit
if he could not run and a healthy wal-
lop was the thing desired evidently
feeling the great responsibility that had
been shifted to his shoulders he se-
lected his bat with care and limped to
the rubber

  a silence that would have shamed
a country churchyard fell upon the
stands as blackdaw wound up and sent
the first ball sizzling into the catchers
mitt

  str-r-ike boomed the umpires so-
norous voice

  blackdaw interested only with the
batter did not watch the runner on
second as closely as he should vance
was aware that a signal had been given
to the colts to play in close and he
saw the third baseman creep nearer to
the plate as blackdaw slowly lifted
his arms above his head vance shot
down toward third

  crocker saw the move and helped
matters along by swinging wildly at the
ball the colt backstop reached out
for the delivery caught it juggled it
a second and pegged the ball in a
straight line to third but the baseman
was playing too far in and vance was
safe on a slide

  he got upon his feet again and
slowly dusted himself while the jubi-
lant lynch danced wildly up and down
the coaching line crocker had two
strikes called on him as vance took a
hazardous lead off the third bag with
an eye cocked speculatively upon the
runner blackdaw made his next de-
livery purposely wide


top-notch magazine

  crocker half struck at the ball but
caught himself just in time he was
obviously uncertain and shaky his
debut upon the scene at so critical a
period had unnerved him vance was
quick to realize it and as quick to put
a desperate plan into operation

  as blackdaw went through his pre-
liminary winding-up motions vance
edged farther and farther away from
the bag as the ball left the pitchers
hand he started forward and to all
appearances stumbled heavily luckily
the ball went wide the colt backstop
quick to see the apparent advantage
straightened stepped back and threw
like a flash to third before the ball
left his hand vance was up on his feet
and sprinting toward home

  the amazed third baseman never -
counting upon so bold a trick ran down
the base line trapped the ball and re-
turned it without waiting to get set
he made a swift and fairly sure return
considering his position and unprepar-
edness  but the ball sailed a trifle low
the catcher braced himselfwith one
foot on the plate reached out-a frac-
tion too far-and lost his balance as
the ball hit the dirt and his glove at the
same moment

  vance launched himself along the
ground feet forward his toe caught
on the rubber his body slued around in
a half circle avoiding the backstops
touch an instant later by many inches
the umpire was on top of the play
and could make no mistake a wide
sweep of his hands palms down in-
dicated that the runner was safe

  vance was dragged to his feet by
his excited and admiring companions
while the crowd in the stands electri-
fied by the sensational bit of strategy
howled their approval the air was
still buzzing with comments when
blackdaw partly recovered from the
shock sent over the third strike on
crocker retiring the side

  four is all we want lynch cried

thats enough four to three it is
and four to three itll stand

  the exulting reds trooped out into
the field and vance stepped into the
box ready for the final session the
crowd cheered him if he could only
hold the colts down to their three tal-
lies the agony would be over he
nerved himself for the struggle

  before the first colt faced him how-
ever a lengthy conference took place
on the locals bench with the result that
a new man stalked grimly to the plate
it was evident that cuttyville intended
to begin their last chance with a pinch
hitter

  vance fooled the batter with a slow
drop a ball and two foul tips fol-
lowed vances next offering broke too
soon and the eager pinch hitter lived up
to his reputation by clouting out a sin-
gle over conners head the second
colt to toe the rubber was also a stran-
ger and vance had two and two
chalked against him before he con-
nected reed ran in on the low drive
scoped it up neatly-and threw wildly
to first before aldred could recover
the ball both pinch hitters were safe

  two men on bases and no one out
was the situation that confronted vance
when blackdaw the colt twirler
stepped to the plate vance made him
bite on a swift curve two balls fol-
lowed in quick succession blackdaw
grinned the confident pitcher shrewdly
judged the next offering and hit a drive
into lynchs hands an easy double
play should have been the result but
the eager and overconfident shortstop
let the ball slip through his fingers-
and the bases were full

  vance did not look around again
once the ball had been returned to him
what he had feared had come to pass
the-men behind him were slowly surely
cracking the strain of the last two
innings had been too great for them
after all they were actors not ball
players-untrained easily confused in-
in the jitney class



experienced that they had put up so
game a fight was to be marveled at
that they were breaking down at the
last was not their fault only a mir-
acle could save them from defeat now

  the batter to face vance in this
breathless and pregnant moment was
the colt backstop vance had fooled
him before could he do it again  he
took his time and shot the first ball
over for a strike next came a ball
then suddenly even as he threw a
sharp pain stabbed his arm he knew
what it meant he was breaking like
the rest of his men his arm was gone
the tortured muscles could be driven no
longer the ball he had meant for a
swift inshoot left his fingers slowly and
wabbled toward the plate

 the expectant colt shoulders
hunched his bat poised stepped in to
meet the delivery he hit the sphere
squarely and mightily it shot away
in a terrific line drive straight between
shortstop and the pitchers box

  a thunderous shout went up from
the stands with a bound even as the
impact sounded vance leaped into
lynchs territory his gloved hand ex-
tended the swift stinging ball was
pocketed with a spat heard to the
farthest corner of the grand stand and
above the roar of the occupants even
with the ball safely trapped vance did
not halt he kept on his course tagged
the colt racing down from third
whirled dizzily and shot the ball to
conner on second conner on tiptoe
caught it and dropped like a flash a
yard from the bag upon the colt run-
ner coming up from first

  the dazed crowd-and even the colt
players-scarcely realized what had
taken place it was only when the um-
pire waved his arms and shouted
sides out that the full meaning
dawned upon them vance assisted by
conner had made a triple play-the
colts had been retired-the game won

  the cheering crowd broke from the
ioa

stands and swarmed out upon the
field as the players victors and van-
quished dashed toward the clubhouse

  half an hour later vance was in the
grand-stand box office with mr wing-
field business manager of the colts
and had received his share of the gate
receipts-five hundred and twenty dol-
lars

  vance said wingfield after the
statements had been signed ive got
to hand it to you youre immense 
you pulled that game out of the fire in
the last inning cuttyville has been
given a treat

  i am glad you are satisfied vance
said already he was framing up an
explanation he felt that mr wing-
field ought to know the truth

  satisfied is too mild a word wing-
field returned and in view of the un-
usual circumstances- he paused

and smiled remembering that two hun-
dred dollars of scanlons money awaited
him at the hotel well he went on
his eyes twinkling for a crowd of
stranded minstrels youve covered
yourselves with glory by george you
have

  despite his surprise vance did not
betray himself we never pretended
to be anything else he said quietly

  thats right you didnt you
told me straight when we arranged for
the match yesterday all the misrepre-
sentation was on scanlons part-and
i guess he has paid for it i believed
him at first i was convinced that you
chaps were the marauders then ac-
cidentally i overheard the little discus-
sion that took place between you and
scanlon behind the grand stand during
the seventh inning i was amazed of
course but i liked the way you talked
to that crook vance by george i
did thats why i didnt interrupt
you said you were going in to win-
and i believed you

  and scanlon- began vance

  he and his friend slipped away

when you pulled off that trick in
the last inning the manager replied
they are probably down at the depot
now waiting for the first train out of
town and i dont think theyll be in
any great hurry to come back again do
you 

  vance smiled and shook his head
then he slowly folded the bank notes
that wingfield had given him and
thrust them into his pocket

  im convinced of one thing he said
at last theres more money in base-
ball than there is in minstrelsy

  wingfield chuckled every time 
he agreed

a substitute for a wife

a young scotchman had married
an english lady and some time
afterward he paid a visit to a bachelor
uncle in scotland

  weel sandy i hear ye hae gotten a
wife said the old man

  yes uncle

  what can she dae 

 do what do you mean
weel the uncle went on can she
sew an knit  does she mend your
claes -

  no the young man admitted
humph commented the uncle
weel does she cook can she mak
parritch

  oh no uncle the young man ex-
plained the servants do all those
things but you should hear her sing
uncle she has the most beautiful voice
you ever heard

  sing repeated the old man scorn-
fully man could ye no hae gotten a
canary 

good advertising

iscussing the value of advertis-
ing the other day a business man
declared that advertising on a big scale
was only of use if you had a really good
thing to advertise you must never

he said try to rush the public into buy-
ing a bad article simply by advertising
largely theyll neither forget nor for-
give if you do

  take the hen he pointed out the
hen is one of the greatest and most suc-
cessful advertisers in the world every
time she lays an egg she-advertises the
fact loudly and that is real good ad-
vertising for no hen ever laid a bad

not much on looks

a distinguished chinese states-
man tells the following story of
his experience with a new york re-
porter 

  he wanted to know the statesman
says how many wives i had and after
i told him i had as many as i needed
he was impertinent enough to ask how
many i required the question did not
please me but i did not let him know
it for that would have been a satisfac-
tion to him which i did not wish to give

  and so i asked how many wives
have you

  the reporter answered quickly
none

   good i said you look as if you
might be able to take care of just that
number 

he knew

jack was a country lad but he had
ambitions to be smart so he went
to the nearest large town and took serv-
ice with a shopkeeper but he deter-
mined to be very cautious as people had
warned him that the city folk might
try to poke fun at him because he was
green

  a staid old maid entered the store
one morning i want some birdseed
please she said pleasantly

  no no maam you cant jush

foregoing installments

a short narrative of previous events for
the benefit of new readers

a larmed by the mysterious opening and
closing of the cupola window in an ap-
parently empty house and finding that the
private watchman can throw no light on the
incident stanley brett a lawyer reports the
matter to sutton owner of the house while
sutton is informing his caller that the open-
ing of the cupola window has been a death
omen twice a bullet crashes in from the di-
rection of the river and mortally wounds
sutton	

  seeing a man with a red lantern in a row-
boat on the water brett races down to the
river and accompanied by suttons niece
ardath sargent whom he finds there com-
mandeers a canoe and pursues the man with
the red lantern ardath seems strangely re-
luctant to capture him and hurries away
after onelook at his face when brett at
length catches him the man-grason-is
arrested on a technical charge of spearing
fish

  brett in company with his friend doctor
mcquaid and the night watchman next ex-
amines the haunted house and finds
recent finger prints on the piano keys
mostly on the black ones showing that it
has been used by a person who plays by
ear the lawyer learns also that the bullet
which killed sutton came from a mannlicher
rifle of which the only known specimen in
iowa is in ardaths charge in the historical
building when he goes to look for it it i
gone and it is ardath who inherits from
sutton

  when brett calls on her brother ralph he
finds that the young man is short in his ac-
counts at his office and has disappeared
later brett sees ardath hurrying to the river
at night with a long slim package which she
throws from a bridge into the water he
drags the river for it and finds the mann-
licher rifle

chapter xiii

the telephone tip

rett never knew how long he
sat dumb and motionless in
the drifting canoe with the
mannlicher held in his pulse-
less grasp he had lost all
reckoning of time he had lost every
sense of his surroundings and under
the cloud that blotted all other impres-
sions his thoughts his personal world
was included only the girl-and the
fact that she had lied to him

 on the day before she had said
that she knew nothing about the miss-
ing rifle and now he found it in the
package he had watched her throw from
the bridge he had fished up evidence
that linked her inevitably with the
crime of her uncles death yet even
the certainty of her guilt at that mo-
ment seemed to trouble him less than
the bitter knowledge that she had de-
ceived him in his eyes the lesser

offense had become the greater because
it struck more directly home

  it was a strange view to take but
he scarcely could be held accountable
for his feelings when a man sud-
denly loses a great and overpowering
faith the thoughts that follow are not
likely to be either clear or rational
brett had believed in the girl he had
trusted her blindly and he knew now
that he came dangerously near to lov-
ing her

  a jolt that made the frail canoe
quiver from bow to stern aroused him
abruptly from his dark reveries he
looked up and saw that he had drifted
against one of the wooden piles that
supported the urbandale trestle a full
half mile below the sixth avenue
bridge with a start of surprise he
dropped the rifle to the bottom of the
canoe and picked up his paddle a
few strokes sufficed to bring the craft
about and he pulled slowly back up-
stream and at length came to a landing
at the club float here he disembarked
housed his canoe wrapped the mann-
licher in an old piece of boat tarpaulin
locked the door of the club building
and left the river bank and climbed
to the street above

  when he reached the middle of the
bridge he stood for a time leaning
against the high railing and gazing va-
cantly up the river he did not know
what he would say or what he might
do when he met the girl but he waited
half hoping half dreading to see her
boat come around the distant bend he
remained there for a long time-how
long he could not have told he was
vaguely conscious that several owl cars
clattered across the bridge behind him
as he stood vainly gazing up the moon-
lit stretch of water and as the night
traction schedule was fixed on the even
hours it must have been near day-
break when at last he picked up the
rifle and started for home

  as brett had expected he found

when he reached his bungalow that
mcquaid had gone to bed and he was
very glad to gain his own room with-
out meeting any embarrassing ques-
tions his first concern was to hide
the mannlicher in his closet and for
greater security he locked the door and
pocketed the key then he followed
his friends example and went to bed

  the sun was well up in the sky when
he awoke from a fitful and troubled
sleep he did not feel at all rested
but he got up nevertheless and after
assuring himself that the rifle was safe
dressed and went downstairs he re-
alized that he had an unpleasant hour
or two ahead of him and was anxious
to have the affair over with as quickly
as possible mcquaid had gone down-
town and brett ate his breakfast in
lonely silence

  he hurried through the meal with
the air of a man who performs a dis-
tasteful duty and as soon-as he had
finished he went to the telephone and
called the historical building an at-
tendant who answered the phone in-
formed him as he expected that miss
sargent had not come in yet she had
sent an explanation however and brett
knew that she must have returned from
her river expedition assuming that
he would find her at home he got his
hat and walked over to the seventh
street cottage

  he reluctantly rang the front-door
bell and sadly waited for a response
the night had brought no relief to his
troubled spirits nor was his problem
any nearer its solution he had no
plans for the moment no definite
thoughts for the future he found
himself on the girls doorstep and
scarcely knew why he had come there
was nothing that could be said between
them-nothing that could be righted or
explained away his duty was per-
fectly clear and there was no reason
to visit her at all yet without ex-
actly knowing why he felt that he
the house of dread



 must see her once more the impulse
 was irresistible and he obeyed it blindly
 and without a question

   it was miss sargent herself who
 came to the door she did not seem in
 the least surprised to see him and she
 even attempted to smile as she invited
 him into the house he followed her
 to the tiny sitting room but made no
 move to take the chair which she
 offered him instead he turned silently
 to scrutinize her

   the effects of a sleepless night
 showed plainly in her face deep
 shadows seemed to lurk about her dark
 eyes her cheeks were colorless and
 when she spoke he caught a pathetic
  note of weariness in her voice

   i have come to have a final under-
 standing with you miss sargent said
 brett at last in spite of his effort
 to mask his deeper feelings he could
 not keep his tones steady

   the girl looked at him bravely from
 beneath her heavy lashes yes she
 said in a plaintive undertone its
 about my brother you mean  i sup-
 pose you saw the newspapers

  he shook his head slowly no-
 its not altogether about your brother
 he did not even try to hide his emo-
 tion now if it only were your

brother if-if- he checked

 himself and faced her with a sudden
 determination to end it all at once
 miss sargent why didnt you tell me
 the truth about that mannlicher rifle
 he asked

   she drew a short tremulous breath
 and seemed to recoil from his sad ac-
 cusing glance why-why what do
 you mean  she whispered

 you told me that you did not know
 where it was he said last night
 i saw you throw it into the river and
 i fished it up after you were gone
 oh she gasped you thought

 that i- she broke off with a lit-

 tie choking sob and could not finish
 her question

  what else could i think asked
brett gently

  there was neither anger nor resent-
ment in her manner and in the dark
haunted eyes that searched his face he
read only sorrow and wistful appeal
you shouldnt have thought that she
said in a low trembling voice i did
not lie to you i would not even
though i thought i should she came
a step nearer to him and her hand
went out pleadingly wont you un-
derstand she begged i told you
only the truth i swear i did wont
you please believe you must believe
me there was something in her at-
titude that strangely echoed bretts
feelings of the night before she
seemed to have lost sight of the real
the tragic issue even as brett had
done and was concerned only by the
lesser fact that he distrusted her

  he looked at her doubtfully in vague
alarm and then in thrilling wbnder at
the half-guessed truth it was some
time before he could trust himself to
speak i found it hard to believe any-
thing against you he said at length
harder than you may think he
shook his head gloomily but what
other choice did you leave me i saw
you with the rifle

  a touch of color came into her
cheeks and she lifted her head proudly
i told you the truth she repeated
when we searched through that case
and found the gun missing i did not
know what had become of it i did
not even guess what had become of it
as he gazed into her clear unwaver-
ing eyes he felt a faint stirring of re-
newed hope-as if it needed but her
unsupported word to restore his old
confidence in her when did you
know he inquired softly

  i did not learn about the gun until
after i had seen you she said until
last night

  where did you find it he asked
  she hesitated an instant and then

looked up at him in quick apprehen-
sion must you ask me that she
faltered

  he nodded grimly im afraid that
i must

  she searched his face in frank per-
plexity you told me yesterday that
you were not my enemy she said after
a pause i wonder how much further
than that you might go she gave
a tiny sigh i wonder if you might
really be a friend

  he gave her such an answering smile
that even had she been blind she must
have caught enough of its meaning to
understand all that he left unsaid she
flushed consciously but did not avert
her glance she began to speak in low
vibrant accents ill tell you every-
thing she said if i may talk con-
fidentially-as a client to her lawyer
as--as a woman to her friend may
i do so 

  brett started to reply but before he
could find his voice heavy footsteps
sounded on the front porch and the
doorbell rang the girl turned in sur-
prise and tried to see through the win-
dow then with a quick anxious look
at her visitor she moved into the hall-
way

  the attorney heard the door open
he heard the sound of voices and as
he stood impatiently waiting for the
girl to get rid of her inopportune caller
she returned unexpectedly to the sit-
ting room with a short red-jowled man
at her heels brett glanced curtly at
the newcomer and it struck him that
he had seen the heavy florid face be-
fore but he could not quite remember
where

  the man did not appear to be at the
same disadvantage he nodded pleas-
antly and it was evident from his man-
ner that he recognized the attorney
good morning he said and then
turned to the girl the chief wants
to see you at headquarters he said
indifferently

  miss sargents lips parted and her
eyes grew wide with dismay what
chief  she gasped what headquar-
ters do you mean

  the newcomer laughed grimly de-
tective headquarters he informed her

  the girls hand caught at the sup-
port of a near-by table are-are you
a detective she asked breathlessly

  of course was the answer and
brett suddenly knew the man as a
plain-clothes officer whom he had seen
in court on several occasions

 but what-what do you want with
me demanded miss sargent her eyes
fixed fearfully upon the face of her
unwelcome visitor

  the chief wants to see you about a
rifle thats missing from the historical
building was the sharp reply

  brett shot a quick startled glance
toward the girl but she did not notice
and for the moment seemed oblivious
of his presence she was standing rig-
idly against the table gazing at the
officer wtith a sort of dreadful fascina-
tion her lips moved but the two men
could barely catch the words when she
spoke what rifle do you mean  she
whispered

  your uncle was shot with a mann-
licher rifle observed the detective
coolly we find that you had such
a gun in your charge at the historical
building and now its gone the chief
wants to know why he wants to know
where it is

  the girl made a valiant effort to re-
gain her self-possession how did you
know that such a weapon was there
she asked how did you learn that
it was missing

  we probably wouldnt have known
admitted the detective frankly if
somebody hadnt telephoned us to go
look

 somebody phoned you she re-
peated in a dull undertone who was
it please

  the man wouldnt give his name
the house oe dread



 answered the officer but he had the
 straight information all right whoever
 he was

   miss sargent looked quickly at brett
 and there was scorn and bitterness in
 her glance and a hint also of sorrow
 and regret he felt the silent accusa-
 tion of her eyes but he said no word
 to defend himself he dared not speak
 while the detective was in the room

   the girl in the meantime turned
back to the officer i suppose that im
under arrest she said quietly

   not this morning said the man
with a shake of his head theres no
actual charge against you and i came
without any warrant you can refuse
to come if you want to but i wouldnt
advise you to do it the chief wouldnt
care for that at all

   ill go with you she said please
 wait until i can get ready she started
 toward the hallway but before she had
 taken a step a door in the back of the
 room was thrown violently open and a
 man appeared on the threshold the
 girl wheeled suddenly and a low-voiced
 exclamation broke from her lips
 ralph she cried what do you
 want 

   brett turned in blank astonishment
 and found himself staring at the girls
 fugitive brother he had supposed that
 the young man was hiding at camp
 douglas miles up the river and his
 unexpected appearance in such a crisis
 left him breathless with wonder

   ralph sargent appeared to take no
notice of the stir he had caused he
ignored his sisters protests and slowly
crossing the room he stopped before
the detective if you dont mind he
said ill go with you in her place
i stole that rifle from the historical
building last night i threw it into
the river my sister knew nothing
about what i had done she never even
saw the rifle he nodded serenely
to the officer if youre ready now
i ill go with you

chapter xiv

the substitute prisoner

i ooking on in silence brett felt a
sudden liking for the young man
who had hurried so opportunely to his
sisters rescue he was a thief by his
own confession undoubtedly had led
a reckless and ungoverned life never-
theless he had met the final test with
courage and dignity there were no
heroics in his attitude only a simple
and quiet determination to shield the
girl he may have taken the rifle as
he said but it was not he who had
thrown it into the river that part of
his story was a deliberate falsehood but
somehow it did not seem to brett the
sort of a lie to lengthen the score
against him brett could not help feel-
ing that his attempt to shoulder the
entire blame went a long way toward
retrieving his past	 

  the detective apparently did not
share bretts appreciation of young
sargents sacrifice a lively satisfac-
tion showed itself in his red face as
he stared at the man who had made
himself a voluntary prisoner well
he exclaimed after a tense pause this
is a surprise he laughed aloud i
guess theres no question about there
being a warrant for you weve been
looking for you and we have got you
now i dont think the chief will be
very mad if i take you down in the
place of your sister you can bet on
it that he wont

  the officer scarcely could be blamed
for his feeling of triumph but at the
same time his laughter was ribt very
pleasant for young sargent or his sis-
ter brett turned sympathetically to
watch the girl and found that she had
taken advantage of the diversion and
left the room almost before he had
time to wonder where she had gone
she reappeared in the doorway with her
hat and coat the brother looked at
her in sudden disapproval you dont

need to go ardath he said quickly
he glanced appealingly at the detective
she doesnt have to come along does
she you surely dont want her now
that youve got me

  the man seemed to debate with him-
self why no he said i dont sup-
pose so he eyed the girl somewhat
dubiously if she promises to stay in
town and will come to see the chief
if he sends for her i guess it will be
all right

  she smiled bitterly im not likely
to leave town now she answered
even if i should want to but i think
i prefer to go with you

  the young man stepped toward her
dont come he begged i dont
want you with me i-it would make
it much harder for me if i need you
ill send for you youll stay at home
wont you  please

  she regarded him intently for a min-
ute and then slowly nodded her ac-
quiescence just as you say she re-
plied but any time you want me
you must let me know

  the brother faced the officer briskly
any time youre ready now he sug-
gested with a fine attempt at cheer-
fulness

  were all ready i guess observed
the detective he started to leave the
room with sargent but stopped ab-
ruptly in the doorway and glanced back
over his shoulder toward the attorney

  we may need your testimony he
said this man admits that he stole
the rifle you wont forget that will
you

  ill not forget said brett and he
remained quiet in the middle of the
room until the front door slammed and
he heard the departing footsteps pass
across the porch and descend to the
outer sidewalk then he turned to the
girl

  she raised her eyes to his and he
saw that all the friendliness had van-
ished from their hazel depths i be-

lieve there is nothing more for us to
discuss she said coldly

  her meaning was only too plain but
brett was unwilling to leave her while
the least vestige of distrust or doubt
lay between them im sorry you
think ive betrayed you he said on
my word of honor i told no one that
the rifle was missing some one else
gave the police that information

  she scrutinized his face earnestly
and somehow he felt that she wished
to believe him if she possibly could
how could any one else have learned
about it she asked uncertainly

  he shook his head i dont know
he answered i suppose it would be
possible for another man to find out
about the gun in much the same way
that i did but i cant imagine who
would go to such trouble or what his
motive could be it was evidently no
one connected with the police he
regarded her curiously you dont
happen to have any enemies  he
queried

  a startled look came into her eyes
why-why no she said i cant
think of anybody who could wish to
injure me she paused an instant
and her expression gradually changed
you really didnt tell then

  no said brett

  there was something in his terse de-
nial that must have carried conviction
for a gertle trusting smile suddenly
touched her lips i am very glad to
know that she said simply then
with an air of having settled her last
doubts about him she returned to their
discussion of her own shortcomings
you have probably guessed now how
i happened to have the rifle after i told
you that i did not know where it was

  i dont believe i have he returned
but i should like to learn how it hap-
pened

  my brother did take the gun she
said he came to see me at the his-
torical building one day and got it out
the house of dread



of its case while i was busy with my
work he lowered it from one of the
rear windows and came back for it
afterward i had no suspicion that he
-had done such a thing until he con-
fessed to me-after i had talked with
you

  tm beginning to understand ex-
claimed brett and he felt both relieved
and troubled as the full significance of
her statement dawned upon him your
brother had the rifle then on the

night- he checked himself sharply

he had it on the night i met you at
the river bank he ended mercifully

   yes she said and looked up at him
in pitiful pleading dont judge him
yet she begged please dont form
an opinion until youve heard every-
thing my brother has been wicked
 and foolish his extravagances have
led him into bad ways he has broken
my heart by the things he has done
it looks very black for him now and
i can hardly blame you if you think
him capable-if-if you think him
worse than he really is she paused
for an instant and then as if scorning
any further evasion or glossing over
of facts she met his glance squarely
and frankly i can swear to you that
he had no hand in my uncles death

  her manner impressed brett more
than anything she might have said he
studied her face an instant and smiled
reassuringly wont you tell me about
it please he asked

   she seemed to gather a renewed con-
fidence from him and her voice was
steadier when she spoke again three
days ago i learned about ralphs trou-
bles at the office he had taken money
hoping in some way to pay it back
but-well you know how those things
always turn out the deficit was dis-
covered before he had a chance to make
it good he came home that night and
told me that he expected to be arresfed
at any moment i didnt have enough
money to help him but i made up my

mind to get it somehow i saw his
employers and they agreed to hold off
the prosecution until i had a chance
to think some way out of the difficulty
ralph spent most of that next day with
me at the historical building and it was
then that he took the rifle i knew
nothing about this at the time but that
night at home i saw that he was excited
about something and watched him
closely he left the house after a while
and i was afraid that he had planned
some desperate scheme to get himself
out of trouble and so i followed him

  ralph went straight to the river
she continued slowly he hired a row-
boat and started to pull downstream
and i hurried after him in a canoe i
didnt know his intentions but i was
afraid that he meant to do himself
harm i thought for a while that he
had lost his nerve and planned to drown
himself after a time i overtook him
and begged him to go home he re-
fused to do so and in my desperation
i told him that i would try to get money
for him from my uncle he agreed to
wait for me until i made the attempt
we went to shore near the entrance
of birdland and then i noticed for the
first time that he had a gun in the
boat he wouldnt tell me where he
got it or how he intended to use it i
did not learn until the next night that
he had stolen it from the historical
building

  did you see a red light on the river
at any time interrupted brett

  if i did i have no recollection of
it she said i was so worried about
ralph that i thought of nothing else
she shook her head despairingly my
uncle could have saved us but he would
not do it you came in when he re-
fused to let me have the money and
you know something of what happened
after that i hurried from the house
and returned to the place where i had
left my brother my canoe was still
there but he had taken his boat and

disappeared i was waiting on the
bank hoping that he might come back
when you came along and found me
there

  you thought the man i chased down
the river was your brother observed
brett i knew at the time that you
didnt want me to use your canoe

  i-i didnt know what to think
she said shuddering at the recollection
you told me that my uncle had been
shot and for a minute i completely lost
my head it occurred to me that ralph
might have fired the bullet he felt
very bitterly toward his uncle and-
and he might have believed that he
would gain something by his death
that fear lasted but an instant how-
ever somehow i was convinced that
he could not have committed such a
terrible crime still i knew that he
had a gun with him and i feared that
if he were caught then it would go
very hard with him she smiled
faintly at brett you are right i
didnt want you to use my canoe and
im afraid that i did fail to warn you
when it looked as if we might go over
the dam she sighed softly im
very sorry now i-i want you to
forgive me

  in the circumstances said brett
gently you couldnt very well have
done anything else

  you can imagine my surprise she
went on when we pulled that man
out of the river below the dam and
i found that i had never seen him be-
fore i was so unnerved then that i
did not dare wait for you to question
me i was very grateful to you for
not trying to detain me

 what did you do afterward
asked brett

  i got the canoe and paddled back
up the river she replied i went
home and found that my brother was
not there i sat up for him nearly all
night but he did not appear and the
next day when you saw me in the his-

torical building i still had no idea what
had become of him that night i got
word from him he had learned that
his employers had tired of their leniency
and had asked the police to arrest him
he had fled up the river and was in
hiding at camp douglas

  and the rifle suggested brett

  i found it that evening in his closet
she said in the time that i was
on the river with you he had gone home
and hidden it there then he became
frightened and ran away before i got
back

  and knowing that the gun might
incriminate him you took it down and
threw it into the river is that cor-
rect 

  yes she answered i believed
that the police might come any minute
to arrest ralph and feared that they
might decide to seach the house i got
rid of the gun intending to send
secretly for a new one to replace it
then i went up the river to camp
douglas and found ralph there

  i knew that interrupted brett
with an air of apology i followed
you

  she looked up at him in astonishment
you followed me she exclaimed i
-i didnt know that

  i was careful not to let you find
out he returned lightly he eyed her
with curiosity why did you go up
the river you endangered the safety
of your brother by doing so

  something of her old pride came
back into her eyes i went to make
him return and face it out she said
i knew that it would be better for
him in the end and besides i have no
patience with a man who will try to
hide from the consequences of his mis-
deeds i had to talk to him very plainly
im afraid but i convinced him that i
was right we returned early this
morning in my boat

  did he tell you why he took the
rifle asked brett
the house of dread



  she glanced at him doubtfully
yes she said after a moment he
told me but i dont know just what
youll think of the story he said that
a stranger came to him a few days ago
and offered him a fhousand dollars for
the mannlicher rifle that i had in my
charge at the historical building the
money would have settled his debts
and he succumbed to the temptation
without asking any questions he was
to deliver the gun the night that my
unde was killed the stranger agreed
to meet him on the river bank near the
sutton house he jbad gone to keep
that appointment when i followed him
after i left him he rowed farther down
the river to the spot where he expected
to meet the man thats why he wasnt
there when i came back

  and the stranger didnt put in an
appearance of course observed brett
dryly

  no she said anxiously watching
his face and you-you dont believe
what ralph said 

  tm not so sure that i dont he
said after a reflective silence i was
really thinking of something else the
fact that another person knew that the
gun was missing and secretly phoned
the police about it may serve as some
slight corroboration of his story he
gazed at her intently if your brother
has told you the truth there is evi-
dently some person who has gone to
great lengths to get the two of you
into trouble he reached for his hat
and turned slowly toward the door i
think i shall go down to police head-
quarters and have a little talk with
ralph if there really is such a
stranger in this affair it looks as if it
would be worth our while to find him

chapter xv

the red-lantern man

orett went directly from miss sar-
gents cottage to the police sta-
tion he passed through the dingy

front corridor and proceeded upstairs
to detective headquarters on the second
floor- a number of plain-clothes men
were loitering about the place and
through an open door of the private
office adjoining he caught sight of the
chief of detectives a quiet keen-eyed
officer with whom he had been ac-
quainted for a number of years he
nodded casually to the men and un-
ceremoniously entered the inner room
good morning chief he said as he
drew up a chair by the officials desk
had a chance to question young sar-
gent yet 

  the officer looked up from his work
and smiled pleasantly hello mr
brett i was sort of expecting you
heard you were mixed up in this case
he turned around in his chair and
glanced toward the door theyre
bringing sargent upstairs now you
may stay here while we talk to him
if you like

  brett nodded his thanks and faced
about curiously as he heard footsteps
in the hallway beyond two men came
through the outer room and he saw
that one was sargent and the other
the red-faced detective the pair en-
tered the chiefs office and the detec-
tive grinned cheerful recognition at
brett as he carefully closed the door
behind him

  there was a brief silence and then
the chief got up from his desk and
gravely confronted his youthful pris-
oner they tell me that you stole a
mannlicher rifle from the collection in
the historical building he observed

  yes answered the young man and
brett saw that while there was neither
sullenness nor defiance in his manner
he was cool and self-possessed

  the chief fixed his eyes intently upon
the young man weve got a warrant
against you for robbing your employ-
ers he said but well let that pass
for the present wre want to get at the
bottom of this other business now and


top-notch magazine

you probably know that your safest
course is to tell the truth

  sargent nodded quietly i knbw
that besides there is nothing that i
wish to conceal

  im glad to hear that was the an-
swer you can begin by telling me
whether you shot your uncle

  a dark red suffused the boys face
but he seemed to lose neither his temper
nor his composure i did not shoot
him he replied in a steady voice and
i havent the faintest notion who did
where were you at the time he was
shot 

  i was on the river bank near his
house

  it was a startling admission for him
to make but the chief evinced no sign
of surprise did you hear an shot
fired or see any one else in the neigh-
borhood 

  i heard no firing was the reply
but i did see a man out on the river
he had a red lantern in his boat

  the chief glanced quickly at brett
and then returned to his catechism
what was the man doing he in-
quired

  i dont know said sargent i
thought he might have been fishing but
his movements didnt interest me and i
paid little attention to him

  where was the stolen rifle at this
time 

  i had it with me was the reply
the officer smiled grimly i sup-
pose you know that thats a very dam-
aging thing to admit your uncle was
killed by a bullet fired from a 
mannlicher and weve about reached
the conclusion that the gun you had
with you was the only one of its sort
in the city

  yes said sargent in a dull tone
i was told-i heard about that
well what do you think about it
asked the chief

  im beginning to think that some-
body has laid a wicked trap for me

he said bitterly some one wanted me
accused of my uncles death he shook
his head despairingly i cant imagine
why

  whom do you suspect asked the
chief but it was evident that he was not
very deeply impressed

  i dont know said the boy it
must have been the man who offered
to buy the rifle from me if i would
take it from the case he glanced ap-
pealingly toward brett and then turned
again to the officer you see he
went on he offered me enough money
for the rifle to get me out of my other
troubles i hoped that i might be able
to replace the gun later and i took it
it never occurred to me that he only
wanted to get me into worse difficulties
and i went to meet him on the river
bank at the time he appointed

  how much did he offer you for the
rifle  asked the chief skeptically

  one thousand dollars

  quite a sum to pay for such a
weapon was the ironical comment
thats about twenty times its real
value

  i thought myself that it was a singu-
larly one-sided bargain returned sar-
gent but i needed the money so badly
that i didnt stop to question the mans
motives

  the officer shrugged his shoulders
i dont suppose you expect me to be-
lieve any of this story do you

  ralph moved uneasily on his feet i
hardly dared hope you would he ad-
mitted reluctantly

  in the brief silence that followed
brett got up from his chair and beck-
oned the chief into a corner of the
room if there is any truth in the
boys yarn he whispered ill wager
you that the man i caught on the river
could fill in the details im more than
ever convinced that that fellow had a
hand somewhere in this business why
dont you show them to each other
the red-lantern man you mean
the house of dread



asked the chief grason his lips
closed angrily id give a good deal
to prove something against that fellow
hes the most insolent proposition
weve ever had around this station
and close-mouthed ive talked my-
self black in the face trying to get a
word out of him and he just sits and
grins he wont tell us who he is or
where he was stopping or why he came
to des moines and he clings to that
fish-spearing story of his ive about
decided to give him a taste of something
he wont like

  brett chuckled suddenly and lean-
ing closer he whispered at some length
to the other man the chief listened
quietly but with a somewhat doubtful
expression on his face and when the 
attorney had finished he hesitated and
glanced speculatively toward sargent
i dont know he mused its a bit
risky but- he paused an in-
stant and then seemed to reach his de-
cision til try it he observed it
may not work but we can at least see
what happens he opened the door
and summoned three of the men who
were sitting about in the outer room
after a short low-voiced conference
the three nodded their understanding
and without a word they left the of-
fice and trooped down the stairway

  as soon as their footsteps had died
away beyond the lower corridor the
chief turned to sargent well go
downstairs to finish our talk he said
accompanied by the others he led the
way to the patrolmens big assembly
room on the first floor of the building
there were several uniformed officers
loafing about the place but he quickly
cleared them out and closed the doors
behind them then he said something
in the ear of the red-faced detective
and motioned sargent to sit down at
one of the tables which the men used
for their card playing

  the detective left the room and the
chief with a sniff of disgust walked

across the floor and threw open one of
the big front windows those fellows
keep it hot enough in here to stifle a
man he said well let in a little
fresh air

  sargent nervously drew up a chair
and sat down brett after a moment
followed his example but the chief re-
mained standing the three waited for
some time without speaking but as the
silence began to grow a bit oppressive
a rear door opened suddenly and a man
was thrust violently into the room in
a single glance brett identified the mys-
terious prisoner grason

  the man evidently had not been per-
mitted to shave and a haggard look
from days and nights spent in basement
cells was beginning to show in his face
but the old reckless light still flashed in
his eyes he did not seem to have been
subdued in the least by his confinement
the detective who had him in charge
pushed him across the room with a none
too friendly hand he didnt want to
come he observed roughly said he
was tired of being talked at id like
to teach him what it means to feel
tired

  the chief offered no comment the
instant the newcomer was hustled
through the doorway he had turned
toward young sargent and narrowly
watched the young mans face well
he demanded at length have you got
anything to say

  the young man glanced at grason
then raised his eyes questioningly to
the officer what do you mean he
asked

  do you know this man

  no was the prompt answer i
never saw him before

  better look again and make certain
advised the chief he isnt the fellow
who tried to buy the rifle from you is
he

  sargent shook his head the other
mans complexion was darker and he
was at least three inches taller than this

one they havent the last resemblance
to each other

 the chief beckoned to grason
come over here he ordered sharply

  the man moved reluctantly across
the room and leaned his weight against
the window sill well what do you
want now he asked gruffly

  you heard what this young man
said replied the officer was that the
truth youre sure youre not ac-
quainted with each other

  grason looked sullenly at his inquis-
itor never saw him before and i
dont care if i never see him again
the chief confronted the man in ex-
asperation ive had enough of this
nonsense he declared angrily ill
give you one minute to change your
tone what is more youre going to
tell me all about yourself without any
more foolishness im through being
easy with you and from now on im
going to make you sweat

  grason did not answer for a space
he stood glaring at the officer then
with a sudden movement he whirled
around and vaulted over the window
sill the others caught a single flash-
ing glimpse of his heavy figure as he
passed through the open window there
was a thud of shoe leather onthe side-
walk below a hurried scrambling of
feet and the fugitive started up the
street as fast as he could run

the blue print

a n observer might have supposed that
brett and the chief were so
stunned by the mans unexpected escape
that neither retained the power to think
or act the attorney did not stir from
his chair and the officer remained
standing by the open window without
making the slightest attempt to follow
the fugitive young sargent had
started to his feet but he made no
further move and indeed he seemed

as much disconcerted by the sudden
turn of events as either of the others

  the red-faced detective alone ap-
peared to arouse himself to the emer-
gency he had thrown himself across
the room with a furious cry and was
just starting to clamber through the
window when the chief caught him
by the sleeve with his body doubled
across the sill the man squirmed around
in the detaining grasp and strove des-
perately to jerk himself free here
whats the matter he panted let
me go

  the chief pulled him back into the
room and quietly closed the window
you dont suppose you can run fast
enough to catch that fellow do you
was the ironical query why hed
make you look ridiculous

  what are you trying to do any-
how  gasped the detective he turned
and stared at his superior in open-
mouthed wonder his face a ludicrous
picture of reproach and amazement and
fatuous protest

  take young sargent back down-
stairs said the chief coolly when
i want you to do any sprinting ill
let you know

  it was apparent from the detectives
manner that he believed his chief had
gone crazy and he was at loss what to
do or say in such an unhappy crisis

but- he stammered that man-

grason-he-hes gone

  that observed the chief dryly is
what i should call a prima-facie propo-
sition-a lead-pipe cinch he grinned
cheerfully better get the other one
locked up again before anything else
happens

  the detective hesitated it was evi-
dent that his world suddenly had turned
itself upside down and he was finding
it very difficult to adjust his faculties
to a new and bewildering state of af-
fairs a prisoner had escaped before
his very eyes and he was supposed to
stand by and not even attempt to re-
the house of dread



capture him for an instant it seemed
as though he might rebel against the
higher authority

  the instinct of obedience however
finally asserted itself in a sort of daze
he turned and beckoned to sargent
come he said gruffly and started
across the room with lagging steps as
he neared the door he paused for a last
pitying glance at his superior officer
and then left the room with his pris-
oner slowly shaking his head and mum-
bling disgustedly to himself

  the chief looked at brett and gave
a short laugh lets go upstairs he
said and led the way back to his pri-
vate office neither of the men com-
mented upon the events of the last few
minutes while the officer returned
quietly to his interrupted work brett
picked up a paper from the desk and
sat down by a window to read the morn-
ings news there ensued a long silence
that was broken only by the steady
scratching of the detectives pen and
the occasional rustle of bretts news-
paper

  nearly an hour must have passed be-
fore the attorney finished his reading
he tossed the paper back on the desk
and after inspecting his watch he
glanced up at his companion with a
faint touch of anxiety its after
twelve he said do you suppose
everythings all right 

  i hope so replied the chief we
ought to be hearing before long he
gazed out of the window for a minute
and then resumed his writing

  brett got up from his chair and be-
gan slowly pacing the floor after a
time he wearied of this exercise and
sauntered into the outer office here
he found the red-faced detective en-
gaged in a silent search through one
of the bertillon cabinets the man
looked up glumly and the attorney was
on the point of making some cheering
remark when his attention was arrested
by the sound of loud voices in the lower

corridor with a thrill of expectancy
he ran into the hall

  a party of men were tramping noisily
up the stairway and as they came
around the first landing he recognized
the trio of detectives whom the chief
had dispatched on a secret mission
brett swept the approaching group with
a quick glance and in his sudden re-
lief he nearly laughed aloud in the
middle of the little squad hopelessly
hemmed in on three sides and climbing
the stairs as if each step were a sepa-
rate protest came the fugitive grason
the detectives on their part looked as
if they might have belonged to an en-
gineering party one carried a sur-
veyors transit over his shoulder an-
other bore a rod and a coil of tape
and the third staggered under the
weight of a heavy valise

  as the men escorted their unwilling
prisoner into the front room the chief
hurried from his office and regarded the
newcomers with a smile of grim satis-
faction your scheme wasnt so poor
after all brett he remarked in frank
appreciation but ill admit now that
i havent felt easy in my mind since i
opened that window down there he
turned to the detectives well what
happened boys 

  the man who had brought in the
valise dropped his burden upon the floor
and grinned at his chief we waited
outside just as you told us he said
i took the alley across from the sta-
tion one of us stopped on the locust
street corner and the other went up
to grand avenue we saw your friend
bound out of the window and go north
he turned the corner by the fire station
and went up grand avenue like a
streak bill watched where he went
while i ran up locust i headed him
at the next corner but slowed down
before he had a chance to know that
i was chasing him

  he kept on as far as fourth street
the man continued and then turned


top-notch magazine

down to walnut i cut through an
alley and got in front of him again
by that time he had let down to a walk
we were all of us careful not to let
him see us running and i guess he
got a notion that he wasnt being fol-
lowed he tried to lose himself by
doubling back and forth through the
streets ill bet he walked miles with-
out getting any place but we all got
together again and after that it was
easy he worked out a regular puzzle
picture before he got through but we
didnt lose a trick

  you followed him home then
asked the chief eagerly

  kirkwood hotel was the answer
he was registered there under another
name when he thought he was safe
he came ipack up fourth and turned
into the lobby he got his key and a
time-table at the desk and went to his
room when we finally jumped in on
him he was packing his bag guess
he was getting ready to grab the fifst
train out of town

  the chief inspected the engineering
instruments which his squad had
brought into the office and then glanced
triumphantly at grason looks as if
we had learned the nature of your pro-
fession at any rate he observed
surveyor arent you

  the prisoner maintained a stubborn
silence and the officer for the moment
did not press his inquiries instead
he picked up the valise unfastened the
heavy clasps and dumped the contents
out upon a large table the men hastily
examined the collection and something
like a sigh of disappointment passed
through the little group

  besides a bundle of blue prints and
mechanical drawings there was a sur-
veyors compass an assortment of
drawing instruments and an old suit of
clothes but in the entire lot there was
not a single clew to suggest the mans
identity or to explain the real purpose
of his visit to des moines the pockets

of the coat were empty and even the
tailors label had been tom from the
lining the prints and drawings al-
though carefully executed lacked any
sort of marginal or explanatory note
it seemed impossible to learn their
meaning unless grason chose to eluci-
date

  and grason apparently had no such
intention after a puzzled inspection
of the prints the chief had turned again
to his prisoner but it soon was evident
that he had found his match grason
had altered his tone somewhat but his
answers to the officers questions while
plausible enough were far from being
satisfactory he had a remarkable fac-
ulty of invention and a quickness of
thought that gave him an almost un-
canny skill at evasion he outwitted
the chief at every point and as the in-
quiry progressed it was clearly seen that
he was not apt to be trapped into any
admission that he did not care to make

  brett listened for a time to the chiefs
questions but he soon recognized the
futility of such a cross-examination and
turned his attention to the drawings on
the table he studied each print in
turn trying to think out what it might
possibly represent in this way he came
at last to a large drawing that seemed
to record a survey of some broad stretch
of land and water his smattering of
technical knowledge enabled him to in-
terpret the print after a general fashion
and he inspected it with growing in-
terest

  through the center of the sheet was
drawn a curving ribbon in blue and
white shading and this he recognized
as a stream of water the ten-inch
scale at the bottom of the drawing told
him that the stream was a river and
that it was at least a quarter mile in
width two points one on each side
were connected by a straight faintly
traced line the purpose of which he
wras unable to determine the rest of
the plat however was more lucid on
the house of dread

s 

both banks of the waterway were jum-
bled groups of white dots which he
guessed were meant to represent
wooded stretches the sheet carried a
sprinkling of tiny numerals and he felt
certain that these marked the various
elevations and depressions of land

  brett left his chair presently and
after a low-voiced consultation with one
of the detectives he succeeded in bor-
rowing a large thin sheet of paper he
spread this out over the blue print and
made a careful tracing of the original
drawing taking pains to omit none of
the numerals his task finished he
folded the copy and placed it quietly
in his pocket

  the detectives were so intent on their
examination of grason that none of
them had given any especial notice to
the actions of the attorney for a mo-
ment brett paused to listen to the in-
quiry but finding that the prisoner was
more than holding his own against the
combined forces of the department he
turned at length and left the room
hurrying from the station he pro-
ceeded to the locust street corner
here he caught a car and rode across
the river to the statehouse

  he entered the capitol and went di-
rectly to the adjutant generals office
in his somewhat extended circle of ac-
quaintance brett included one of the
attaches of the militia department he
sought this friend now and had little
difficulty in persuading the man to lend
him a pair of military field glasses
equipped with the binoculars he passed
through the main corridor of the build-
ing and took an elevator to the top
floor from this point he ascended the
steep winding stairway that led to the
great gilded dome of the capitol
reaching the top he opened the door
which usually was left unlocked to vis-
itors and passed to the high circular
balcony outside 

  brett leaned against the guard rail
and surveyed his surroundings the
na

capitol stood on the crest of a sloping
hill and its lofty dome was probably
the highest point in des moines from
his dizzy altitude the attorney obtained
a clear view of the country for miles
around the city lay at his feet like
a great map

  from the foot of the capitol grounds
locust street stretched away in a
straight line to the river crossing its
wide concrete bridge near the new city
hall passing between the public library
on the one hand and the huge coliseum
on the other and losing itself at last
in the heart of the west-side business
district beyond a little to the left
the tops of the hippee and the flem-
ing buildings reared themselves high
above their neighbors and farther on
he could make out the green sweep of
grand avenue and the neighboring res-
idence streets with the glistening
stretch of the raccoon river twisting
down from the west

  brett adjusted his binoculars pres-
ently and walking part way around the
balcony he turned to view the heights of
north des moines from this point his
glance ranged down to the curve of the
des moines river taking in the sandy
beach along boatmans island then the
forest-grown area of birdland and ut
last the smooth green lawns of union
park and the head of pennsylvania
avenue

  after a time he brought out his copy
of grasons blue print he studied this
carefully for a moment and then smil-
ing quietly to himself he refolded the
sheet of paper returned the binoculars
to their case and descended from the
dome as soon as he had restored the
field glasses to their owner he left the
capitol hailed a westbound street car
and started for home

  mcquaid was just finishing his lun-
cheon when brett arrived at the bun-
galow the physician looked up curi-
ously and with a hint of disapproval 
too as his friend came into the room


top-notch magazine

where in the world have you been for
the last day he demanded it must
have been after daylight when you got
in this morning

  ive been very busy was the hasty
answer havent time to stop now
ill tell you all about it later

  why such a hurry asked the doc-
tor

  brett had started toward his bed-
room but he turned for an instant and
gravely regarded his friend ive got
an appointment he said or at least
i fancy that i have im going out to
the government rifle range

  youre going where demanded the
astonished physician

  brett chuckled softly captain
rudd at the army post asked me to
come out for some target practice
he answered ive decided to accept
his invitation

chapter xvii

on her way

a week passed and so far as pub-
lic knowledge was concerned the
death of cornelius sutton remained as
deep and perplexing a mystery as it had
been that first night when the mann-
licher bullet came crashing through his
library window a coroners jury had
met and after solemn deliberation re-
turned a verdict of premeditated kill-
ing and recommended ralph sargent
to the mercies of the grand jury no
further steps against the young man
had been taken but it was popularly
rumored that a first-degree indictment
would be announced almost any day
ralph had been transferred to more
comfortable quarters in the county jail
and there he stoically awaited his fate

  as for grason the red-lantern man
he apparently had withstood the re-
peated grillings by the detective staff
and continued to be a hopeless puzzle to
the department a ruthless cross-ex-

amination had failed to elicit a single
vital fact and the police at last had
given up the task they still held him
in his basement cell but there had been
no open attempt yet to connect him
in any way with suttons death the
original charge of spearing fish m vio-
lation of the game laws remained on
the sheet against him but the police
were careful not to let him go to trial
on this minor count they merely
waited in the hope that some fresh turn
of events should give them an excuse
to ask for an indictment on more seri-
ous grounds

  suttons will had been probated a
couple of days before and the public
was aware now that ardath sargent
was to be her uncles sole heir among
the older families this announcement
was received with frank satisfaction
considerable hostility had manifested
itself toward ralph sargent but no
one had even dared to suggest that the
girl was in any way involved in her
brothers troubles the quiet digni-
fied manner with which she faced the
family crisis had awakened general ad-
miration and she learned suddenly that
the population of the city was made up
almost entirely of friends and well-
wishers

  early in the week the girl came to
brett with a request that he take charge
of her interests in the estate and she
also begged him to assume the defense
of her brother he was surprised and
gratified by her confidence but he hesi-
tated nevertheless feeling that one of
the veteran criminal attorneys in the
city might serve her ends better she
insisted however and he consented to
take the case at this conference miss
sargent brought up the question of
money ill have more than enough
later but for the present im not very
well off it probably will be weeks
before the affairs of the estate are set-
tled

  the attorney smiled at his new client
the house of dread



i shouldnt worry about that he re-
plied

  but i do worry she insisted i
cant hava you paying expenses out of
your own pocket she remained
thoughtfully silent for a moment my
lease on the cottage expires in two
weeks she observed at length  if i
sign again it will have to be for a year
i wonder if it would be possible for
me to move into one of my houses-to-
be i could save all that rent money
and it would be a great help to me

 why i dont see why you
shouldnt he answered quick to see
the advantages of her scheme ill
talk to the probate judge if you wish
me to hes very friendly toward you
and im quite sure hell let you take
possession in a sort of unofficial way
which house did you intend to live in 

  the one on arlington avenue she
said promptly the house where my
mother was born

  brett looked at her sharply and
seemed on the point of making some
objection but he suddenly changed his
mind and quietly nodded ill see if
i can fix it with the judge he prom-
ised

  and so it was settled the attorney
had little trouble in persuading the court
to make a concession in the girls favor
two days later she made her plans to
move

  the old house opposite bretts bunga-
low suddenly awakened to the unfamil-
iar swish of brooms and the rattle of
buckets windows were washed and
opened and the new sweet air from out
of doors was given its chance in the
musty rooms the furniture was reno-
vated the dingy curtains were laun-
dered the old rugs got their long-
deserved beating the leaking gutters
were plugged and the lawn received a
cutting and a raking then miss sar-
gent packed her personal belongings
and moved into the old homestead

thus the ancient dwelling after many
years came back into its own

  the house acquired a mistress and
later a maid-a portly good-natured
colored woman who answered to the
name of delilah i mean to go on
working until my finances are in better
shape miss sargent explained so i
shall need somebody to look after the
house besides im all alone now
she smiled pathetically at her attorney
delilah will be a sort of chaperon for
me

  on the night that the expected in-
dictment was returned against ralph
sargent brett looked in to see his
sister she invited him to the little
music room in the back part of the
house and offered him a chair i
spend most of my evenings in here
she said as she sat down before her
grandmothers old piano and leaned her
arm upon the polished case its much
cozier i havent quite got used to the
other rooms yet they seem so need-
lessly big 

  brett broke his news as gently as
possible and found that the girl was
prepared for it im really glad that
its come she said it will be better
for all of us to have the trial over with
as quickly as possible she glanced
unhappily at the attorney youre pre-
pared to go to trial arent you 

  he nodded grimly perhaps im
better prepared than the prosecution
thinks at any rate i hope to have a
surprise or two for them by the time
the case is called he regarded her
curiously what are you going to
do with your brother if we get him
off	

  i have haa a talk with him she
answered and i know that he is ready
to take up a new life if-if he has the
chance he wants to go on west and
try to make a fresh start i shall give
him enough money to open some sort
of business he says he wont take it
but im going to see that he does she

raised the lid of the piano and began
idly strumming the keys

  as brett sat watching her she struck
a tentative chord and then slowly wan-
dered into a quaint languorous melody
that seemed to awaken some old mem-
ory in the attorneys thoughts he lis-
tened for a space and suddenly got up
from his chair dont he exclaimed

  she stopped playing and looked up
at him in surprise why not she
asked ive just had the piano tuned
that wasnt what i meant he re-
turned its-do you know what you
were playing

  why yes its rubinsteins mel-
ody in f i learned it from my mother
dont you like it 

  for a moment brett seemed at loss
to explain himseif why yes he said
somewhat embarrassed its a beautiful
air but somehow id rather-i prefer
to hear you play something else

  her puzzled frown gradually gave
way to dimpling amusement why i
believe youre superstitious she said
i know whats the matter youre
thinking of that old story about my
grandmother

  youve heard it then brett asked
often she gave a tiny shrug of
her shoulders my uncle was always
talking about it he had a horror of
the melody he wouldnt permit any
one to play it in the house she eyed
her companion doubtfully you really
dont think i should keep that old bogy
alive do you

  i dont know said brett with a lit-
tle laugh i- he stopped short

and stared across the room as the pon-
derous figure of delilah the colored
maid appeared unexpectedly in the
doorway the woman was wearing her
hat and coat and in her hand she car-
ried a heavy canvas valise her plump
black face had lost its old happy care-
free expression and was now set in
lines of stubborn determination im
on my way from here she announced

in a tragic voice good-by miss ar-
dath

  the girl got up from the piano stool
why wthats the matter delilah  she
demanded in astonishment

  whats the matter exploded the
woman dont you ask me whats the
matter ask  that other person what
lives in this house and goes walkin
around all the time a-openin windows
and a-closin windows and trompin
around through these rooms and never
lettin nobody see hide nor hair of him
you just ask somebody else whats the
matter miss ardath im on my way
from here

  what do you mean asked miss
sargent do you think this house is
haunted she repressed a smile is
that what youre trying to tell me 

  the woman shifted  her feet and
her glance roved uneasily about the
room dont you get to askin me
what i think she muttered you got
me sleepin in that room under the-

under that-

  cupola suggested brett who was
watching her dark face with a strange
interest

  -sleepin under that tower she

went on breathlessly and last night
that window up there went open and
the night before that it went open and
to-night i locked it down tight and
there werent no mortal come into that
tower but it went open just the same
no sir dont you get to askin me what
i think im on my way from here
dont be absurd delilah inter-
rupted miss sargent she turned ap-
pealingly to brett tell her how fool-
ish she is begged the girl persuade
her not to go talk her out of such
nonsense

  brett slowly shook his head im
sorry he said but i dont see that
i can say anything to stop her going
really if i were in delilahs place im
afraid that i too would be on my way
from here

chapter xviii

in the cupola

drett took his leave of miss sar-
gent soon after delilah had swept
ponderously from the house he saw
that the girl was the least bit provoked
at his failure to help her exercise the
superstitious fears of her maid but he
only smiled as he said good night and
he went away without any attempt to
excuse his singular course of conduct
perhaps he did feel some slight sense
of guilt for his part in depriving his
client of her servant but he eased his
conscience with the thought that the
woman could be replaced later

  for the present he was sure that he
could have said nothing to persuade
her to stay he knew as well as delilah
that something was distinctly wrong
with the old house-that some lurk-
ing silent unseen thing did cause the
cupola window to open and close at all
hours of the night whatever strange
agent was at work there he had made
up his mind to drag it from hiding and
settle the grim rights of tenure for all
time and his plans he believed could
be carried out more satisfactorily if the
servant were out of the way

  brett crossed the street to his own
bungalow butie made no move to go
inside instead he sat down on the
front steps and waited the period of
moonless nights had set in and save
for the dim yellow light of a gas
lamp in the next block the street was
shrouded in darkness

  across the road he could barely make
out the square black shape of the old
cupola and he could only approximately
fix the position of the mysterious win-
dow he watched the lights in the
downstairs rooms go out one at a time
and presently a gleam appeared through
the shade of one of the second-story
windows this too vanished after a
while and he knew that miss sargent
had retired for the night

  he remained on the stoop a few min-
utes longer silently contemplating the
gloomy premises across the street with
the extinguishing of the last light the
old house seemed to come once more
under the spell of its past the recent
signs of occupancy were lost in the
darkness of the night for the moment
brett scarcely could believe that any
change had taken place to his brood-
ing fancy the events of the last few
days were like the memories of a dream
from which he must surely awaken to
find the old dwelling as he had al-
ways known it-silent unoccupied and
lonely waiting through the years for
some one who never came

  the sound of footsteps in the next
block aroused brett and hoping that it
might be mcquaid he got up from the
stoop and sauntered down toward the
front walk he was somewhat disap-
pointed when he saw that the solitary
pedestrian was only the night watch-
man the man came up through the
darkness and stopped as he recognized
the attorney watching that house
again he asked

  oh i dont know answered brett
lightly do you think its worth watch-
ing

  i should say that it was rejoined
the other ive just met miss sar-
gents colored girl she tells me that
so many strange things have happened
in that house that she decided to quit
her job

  thats odd observed brett care-
lessly but then of course she comes
from a race that believes in spooks and
such things as that

  im going to quit too volunteered
the watchman after a brief pause

  youre going to quit exclaimed
the attorney what for on account
of the sutton house

  well not exactly on that account
im tired of the job for one thing
the man hesitated in seeming embar-
rassment i suppose maybe i do have


top-notch magazine

another reason he admitted i dont
exactly like the things ive seen around
here lately and i thought id better get
off the beat before anything happens
i dont care for the responsibility

  brett tried to see the mans face
what is it that youve seen  he in-
quired

  nothing at all except what you
yourself have shown me you know as
much about it all as i do maybe such
things dont bother you but id just
as soon have somebody else take my
job

  when do you quit asked the at-
torney

  this is my last night the watch-
man answered he turned away and
started up the sidewalk

  good nignt the attornej called as
he stood watching the retreating figure
i suppose you and delilah will have
me moving out of the neighborhood
next he added with a laugh

  brett waited until the sound of the
watchmans feet had died away in the
next block and then he crossed the
street and tiptoed to the veranda of the
old house he climbed the steps softly
and paused before the window which
mcquaid had forced open several
nights before he tried the frame and
found to his satisfaction that the bro-
ken lock had not been repaired press-
ing gently upward he raised the sash
inch by inch and as soon as he had
made the opening large enough he
climbed over the sill and closed the
window behind him

  for a time he stood in the front room
quietly listening no sound of life
came to disturb him and he took it for
granted that miss sargent was asleep
he had refrained from telling her of his
plans chiefly because he did not care to
let her know how seriously he was af-
fected by the odd manifestations in her
home either he would arouse her
fears needlessly or he would call forth
her derision and he was as anxious to

spare her the one result as he was to
guard himself against the other he
felt besides that he could accomplish
his ends best by working secretly and
alone if she should happen to dis-
cover his presence in the house it would
be time enough then to explain his er-
rand

  convinced that his stealthy move-
ments had not been heard brett passed
into the hallway and cautiously mounted
the front stairs he held his breath as
he crept beyond the silent rooms of the
second floor and stole through the door-
way that led up another flight to the
story above he gained the top of this
stairway without mishap and a feeling
of deep relief came over him as he
groped his way forward to the tiny
front chamber under the cupola as
he pushed open the door and entered
the room he struck a match and
glanced about him

  this was evidently the room that de-
lilah had occupied during her brief stay
in the house and from the state of dis-
order in which she had left the place
he judged that she had packed her be-
longings in a considerable hurry the
darkness hid his smile of amusement as
the match burned itself out it was not
difficult to picture delilahs emotions
when she cleared herself out of the
tower chamber

  brett had no need for a second match
he remembered his surroundings per-
fectly from his previous visit and he
moved without hesitation into the little
alcove and confidently climbed the last
flight of stairs to the cupola above
here he struck another light and a sin-
gle glance showed him that nothing had
been disturbed since he was last in the
room

  the carpenters bench still remained
the only piece of furniture within the
four walls and a closer inspection
proved that no one had made even a
pretense of cleaning out the accumula-
tions of dust before his match went
the house of dread



out brett examined the window he
tried both of the catches and after as-
suring himself that they were securely
fastened he moved softly across the
floor and sat down on the workbench to
wait

  how long he sat there in the darkness
he could not have told he heard a
clock chiming somewhere in the dis-
tance but he failed to count the strokes
and he did not care to risk lighting an-
other match to look at his watch after
a time he drew himself farther back
upon the bench and leaned his shoulders
against the wall he tried to fix his
mind upon tangible things of the pres-
ent but somehow his thoughts kept re-
verting to the ancient tragedy of the
old house-to the man who had thrown
himself out of the cupola window and
the woman who could not console her-
self with music and had tried to follow
him

  a deathlike hush had fallen over the
premises there was neither sound nor
movement nor hint of life anywhere
about him as the minutes dragged on
interminably there came to him a dim
sense of uneasiness an instinct seemed
to tell him of some subtle change that
had taken place in the dead atmosphere
of the room and there stole upon him
a gradual consciousness of a faint cold
breath of air upon his forehead he
sat up with a start and looked across
the chamber

  he could distinguish nothing in the
gloom but had an impression that some-
thing had stirred along the opposite
wall cautiously he drew a match from
his pocket and with a little shiver of
expectancy he slid down from the
bench and went forward on tiptoe he
was positive that no living creature
could have crept into the room while
he was keeping vigil yet something was
busy at the window fastenings

  he heard a distinct clicking sound
as if a catch had been drawn stealthily
from its socket with a sudden move-

                                            a

ment he struck the match and in the
yellow flare of light he saw that the
room was empty he was alone in the

cupola yet- he glanced across the

chamber and the blood ran cold in his
veins the window was going up in its
casement

  the match burned out and fell from
his pulseless fingers for an instant he
stood rigidly in his tracks his eyes star-
ingwildly through the darkness then
scarcely knowing what he did he
stepped forward and touched the sash
he pressed down unsteadily with his
fingers but the window obeying some
unseen force continued to slide up-
ward raising his hand with it as it
slowly opened

footsteps on the stairs

tvhere are certain natural laws that
remain forever unchanged a win-
dow for instance may not go up with-
out human assistance if its counter-
weights should happen to break it con-
ceivably might go down alone but it
could never go up such was the sub-
stance of bretts thoughts as he stood
in the deserted cupola of the old sutton
home and watched the sash of the win-
dow gradually ascending in its case-
ment

  there was evidently something wrong
with his logic that which he was posi-
tive could not happen was taking place
before his eyes he was not dreaming
he knew that he never had been more
widely or intently awake nor was he
frightened he was quite sure of this
because with fear there always comes
the impulse to run away brett did not
want to run he probably could not have
done so if he had tried a strange
chilling fascination held him powerless
to ipove he felt an insane desire to
laugh but somehow the muscles of his
throat refused to respond to the wish

so he merely held his breath and
waited

  it seemed to him that the sash never
would reach the top of the casement
it moved slowly almost imperceptibly
as if a sly and cautious instinct gov-
erned the invisible power behind it his
suspense brought on a singular feeling
of resentment if the thing must go
up he could not see why it needed to
take such a time about it he had a
whimsical notion that he might help it
along with a good forcible boost but
before he could carry out this idea the
sash finished its journey unaided and
came to a rest against the upper casing

  brett hesitated an instant and then
gripping the sill with his fingers he
leaned far out over the open ledge he
carefully scrutinized the outer wall of
the cupola but even as he did so he
knew that he was wasting his time
there was not the tiniest projection
either above or below where any climb-
ing human might have obtained a foot-
hold if this had been possible the un-
fastening of the locks remained to be
explained this could not have been
done from without on the other hand
he knew that no person beside himself
had entered the cupola

  he drew back into the room pres-
ently and inspected the window from
the other side lighting another match
he went painstakingly over the entire
sash but as on the night of his pre-
vious search he found nothing to ex-
plain the phenomenon the mystery
apparently had no material solution as
far as he could see there were no cords
or wires or in fact any other device
by which the window might have been
either pushed or pulled up from without
the cupola

  it occurred to him that there might
be something queer in the construction
of the chamber walls-some sort - of
trapdoor or sliding panel perhaps or a
secret passage or compartment he
could satisfy himself on this score at

least and until his nerves became
steadier he was glad to find some defi-
nite occupation for his thoughts

  he began by an examination of the
floor starting in one corner of the
room he made his way forward on his
hands and knees trying each separate
plank with the blade of his knife in an
attempt to learn whether anything was
loose he experimented in this way
upon every square foot of floor space
but as far as he could determine the
boards were all nailed securely to the
joists underneath convinced at last
that there was no possible opening from
below he was about to turn his atten-
tion  to the wainscoting when a faint
sound from one of the rooms down-
stairs interrupted his work and brought
him bolt upright to his knees

  he hastily extinquished the match he
was burning and waited silently in the
darkness again it came-a sharp
creaking sound like a door swinging
on rusty hinges something was evi-
dently astir on the second floor he
feared for a minute that he had dis-
turbed miss sargent and that she might
be coming upstairs to see what was
wrong

  a long interval passed without any
repetition of the noise however and he
concluded at length that he had allowed
himself to become alarmed unneces-
sarily it was unlikely that his stealthy
movements could have been heard and
he concluded that some door had merely
shut in a draft reassured by this ex-
planation he turned back to his search
of the room as he resumed his in-
spection of the wainscoting however
the door creaked once more and this
time he was certain that he heard a soft
tread of feet

  with his senses keyed to the highest
pitch he remained kneeling in the cor-
ner of the room listening to the muf-
fled sounds below there was no doubt
now that some one was awake and mov-
ing about on the second floor as he
the house of dread



waited anxiously he heard a heavy
measured tramping as of a person who
had started slowly up the stairs and was
carefully feeling the way in the dark-
ness

  for an instant brett believed that
miss sargent had left her room and
for some reason was climbing up to the
floor above but this impression was
short-lived he suddenly realized that
her small feet never could come down
with such solid and weighty thumps as
those that were ascending the stairs
whoever it was that was coming to visit
the upper part of the house he knew
that it could not be the girl

  brett drew back farther against the
wall and waited with beating pulse he
had not the faintest idea what to ex-
pect but somehow he felt that the mys-
terious genius of the house was about
to reveal itself just when or how the
disclosure might be made he did not
know nor did he especially care there
was something decidedly material and
fleshly in the sound of the oncoming
footsteps and this was enough to give
him a complete renewal of self-confi-
dence and courage whatever hap-
pened now he was ready

  he heard the intruder pass through
the room that delilah had occupied
tramp on into the alcove beyond and
without an instants hesitation begin
to mount the last flight of stairs that led
directly to the cupola with every mus-
cle set brett crouched in the corner and
strove desperately to see through the
gloom

  a huge shadowy form appeared at
the head of the stairway hovered there
an instant and then moved slowly
across the room toward the open win-
dow brett knew that his opportunity
had come and springing to his feet he
threw himself recklessly forward

  he collided in the darkness with some
heavy muscular body but before his
groping fingers could secure their
sought-for hold he was pushed aside

and flung violently against the wall
there was a sound of harsh breathing
a scuffling of shoe leather a thud of
some soft yielding weight falling to the
floor and a quick rush of feet across
the room to the stairway

  brett recovered himself in an instant
he heard the heavy steps descend from
the cupola and clatter noisily through
the room below aroused by the fear
that the intruder might escape him he
started forward in pursuit but with his
first move he stumbled over some object
at his feet and pitched headlong to the
floor he turned in surprise fumbled
in his pocket and struck a match

  a little cry of wonder and of horror
broke from his lips and his face went
deathly pale in the flickering light ly-
ing beneath the open window was the
still slim figure of a woman she was
muffled to the chin in a long blue dress-
ing gown and the dark coils of her hair
almost concealed her colorless face but
it needed no more than a glance to tell
him who she was he crept to her side
and touched her hand and she neither
moved nor spoke miss sargent he
whispered and his voice trembled with
anxiety ardath she did not an-
swer he raised her fearfully in his-
arms and saw that she was uncon-
scious

the big idea

iayne came into my room
looking as if he were going
to shed tears mac he
quavered mournfully youve
got to keep that humming
bird away from my basket-ball team
you know how he ruined it last year
with his meddling-and now hes begun
coming down to practice every day and
this afternoon i caught him trying to
string some wires from the baskets
youve simply got to make him let us
alone or well disgrace the college
again

  i was sorry for jayne he took his
basket-ball captaincy so seriously that
he actually wanted peaches dunlap to
quit the football squad and to come and
play guard for him-and peaches an
all-american end too

  thats too bad old man i said
but you know the humming bird-
when he once makes up his mind to
meddle with a team all the kings horses
and all the kings men cant stop him
look at what he did to the football
season ill do my best but i guess
youd better make up your mind to face
some more trouble

  jayne gloomed about a while longer
and then went out looking as though
hed lost his last friend i felt awfully
sorry for him and pretty mad at isaac
newton diefenberger for bothering
with him after shaking up the best
football team we ever had at bruns-
wick i thought the humming bird
wouldnt be keen on monkeying with
athletics so soon again but i knew
better than to argue with him

  so when he came in full to the neck
with contempt for the unscientific way
basket ball was being played and sim-
ply exuding scorn for the lowbrows who
had devised the rules so as to exclude
most forms of genuine science i was
foolish enough to sympathize with him
although all the time my fingers itched
to administer a little good old-fashioned
corporal castigation he raved and
raved against the rule makers until
finally i got a great idea the way to
handle the humming bird it struck
me suddenly was to divert his attention
so that he wouldnt understand he was
being handled but how that was
the question i wrinkled my forehead
and tried to think

  there isnt a single indoor sport
thats worthy of the name declared
isaac newton chess and checkers
trained to a tiddle



and debating arent interesting to watch

- think of a mans considering

checkers a sport-basket ball is clum-
sily unscientific and so is water polo
all winter long i have to submit to the
vexation of seeing men waste their time
on silly games that lack every essential
element of true sport

  why then i said suddenly seeing
a great light why dont you get busy
and invent a brand-new indoor game-
something that comes up to your idea
of what a sport ought to be

  he stared at me and i could see he
was fairly fascinated by the idea it
flashed over me that if i could interest
him in thisplan hed be likely to leave
poor jayne in peace and i egged him
along craftily

  it makes me tired to sec you wast-
ing that brain of yours on these child-
ish games anyway i continued its
worthy of better things you could
invent something that would make us
anxious to have the football season
end and let us get busy on your game
instead why dont you try it

  he held out his hand and i shook it
solemnly mac he said i am not
often impressed with the caliber of your
mentality but i must admit that some-
times you have inspirations which
amount to positive genius and this
is one of them i shall adopt the sug-
gestion at once basket ball indeed
wait till i show them my game

  he was so serious about it that i
could hardly keep my face straight un-
til i got outside the door then i re-
lieved my feelings in a whoop of laugh-
ter which lasted all the way to jaynes
quarters he could scarcely believe it
when i told him how i had rescued
his beloved basket-ball squad from the
impious machinations of isaac new-
ton and his science

  at last i convinced him that he was
safe for the present anyway he
cheered up a little and thanked me but

when i left he shook his head and
sighed mournfully

  whats the matter now  i de-
manded a little peeved at his failure to
appreciate my services he sighed
again

  it looks all right mac he said
gloomily and im a million times
obliged to you but-

  but what i snapped

  but you cant tell what that little
highbrow will be up to he declared
i tell you ive got a feeling that hell
spoil things somehow he always
does doesnt he

  i slammed the door and went away
some people are born pessimists and
jayne was about the champion of them
all

chapter ii

through rosy lenses

isaac newton plunged into his
new occupation with a zeal which
almost interfered with his precious
studies he cluttered up our quarters
with samples of every known sort of
parlor game he read a whole library
of books on the topic from a fat one
entitled sacrificial sports of the solo-
mon islands to a thin one named the
play instinct and why and he in-
vestigated a whole lot of fairly common
games like billiards and pool for in-
stance the deeper he got into the sub-
ject the greater became his contempt
for all existing forms of indoor amuse-
ments

  he spent a lot of time over one imi-
tation baseball game which fired a rub-
ber marble out of a popgun labeled
matty against a little fence marked
wagner and made it bounce back
into a net branded home run but
he finally passed it up as trivial and un-
spectacular he fooled around with
parlor croquet and parlor golf and
abandoned them in huge disgust he ex-
perimented with parchesi and poker and


top-notch magazine

ping-pong and decided that none of
them would do he rather liked one
game called pillow-dox in which you
blowt a rubber balloon around without
touching it but that didnt quite suit
him either

  by the hour he explained what he
was after he told me over and over
that he wanted a game which required
some digital dexterity-whatever that
may mean-and yet didnt depend upon
speed or strength or too much practice
that was the trouble with billiards
for instance which would have suited
him if he hadnt tried to play it and
discovered that it takes about ten years
to acquire the rudiments of a decent
skill at it he even tried jackstraws
which he said embodied almost all the
necessary elements including a large
element of chance but abandoned them
because of the fact that the spectators
wouldnt be able to see the fine points
of the play

  all of this research occupied him for
three or four weeks while jayne pol-
ished up his basket-ball gang and
finally took them up to columbia where
they defeated the same crew that had
trounced us the year before thanks to
the humming birds magic wire in
the baskets which got twisted so that
we couldnt score a goal to save our
lives and columbia threw baskets to
their hearts content

  jayne felt a whole lot better after
that and even he was beginning to re-
gard me as entitled to pedestal right in
between edison and tesla when the
humming bird made his great discov-
ery he rushed into my bedroom and
dragged me out to inspect it late one
night

  i stood there shivering barefooted
and watched him unroll a package from
which he took out a little cup and a
handful of small disks that looked like
miniature poker chips he put the cup
in the middle of the table scattered
the disks around it and then began

snapping them with a little plectron
like the thing mandolin players use
finally he made one hop up into the
cup and looked up at me pleased as
the cat that ate the canary

  there  he said that is the ideal
sport i didnt have to invent it-i
discovered it all ready for us isnt it
splendid 

  i was pretty sore at being waked out
of a healthy sleep to fool with such
nonsense but i didnt intend to go back
on poor jayne

  what do you call it i said just as
though i wanted to know

  its a silly name said isaac new-
ton i imagine it is of negro origin
it is called-tiddle-de-winks-i sup-
pose it should be tiddle-fo-winks
but the name makes no difference
from every point of view mac i have
here before you the king of indoor
sports

  i guess youre right isaac newton
i said trying to look as much impressed
as possible it strikes me as one lit-
tle gem of a game and youre a regu-
lar wizard to have dug it up

  he was perfectly foolish with glee at
my appreciation and before he let
me climb back into bed he made me
listen to a long story about how tiddle-
the-winks was bound to replace all the
silly little indoor games that had ever
been tried and become the great ameri-
can winter sport i let him rave-there
wasnt any use in arguing with him
and i wasnt sure just how the whole
thing was going to affect jayne and his
precious team i wanted a chance to
sleep on it before i went any further
with my plot

chapter iii

head of the league

there were only a few days left
before the holidays and although
isaac newton started in the very next
morning on his campaign for the in-
trained to a tiddle



troduction of tiddle-the-winks as one
of brunswicks major sports the fel-
lows were leaving for home before the
word got out among the students as a
mass

  but shark poofer and poler jiggs
and a lot of that crowd took to it like
ducks to water the humming bird
had a bunch of them in the rooms all
the time-except of course for classes
-working out the science of the game
and devising a set of rules for team
play which they solemnly wrote out in
words of seven syllables describing ex-
actly how many centimeters in length
the tiddle might be and the exact
weight limit in milligrams of each and
every wink

  i nearly expired from trying to keep
my face straight while they deliberated
and peaches and breath whickert and
jayne and the rest of the conspirators
nearly laughed themselves sick over my
descriptions of it then we all went
home for the holidays and forgot all
about it till we came back

  the day after i got in i found the
humming bird deep in a pile of letters
which he was answering with a great
deal of care i asked him what it all
meant as he usually didnt bother much
with correspondence

  these are the replies to my chal-
lenges he said importantly

  challenges what challenges i
demanded and he pushed some of the
letters across the desk

  see for yourself he said impa-
tiently dont interrupt me-this is
very important

  i could hardly believe my eyes there
was a letter from the chairman of the
athletic committee at yale addressed to
isaac n diefenberger captain tiddle-
the-winks team brunswick univer-
sity solemnly accepting the humming
birds invitation to send a tiddle-the-
winks team down to compete with ours
under the rules of the intercollegiate
tiddle-the-winks league on april i

 and a week later harvard
promised to be on hand other games
were scheduled with penn and cornell
and the humming bird was actually
contemplating one with michigan

  how on earth are you going to get
the money to finance all this i asked
itll cost a lot of coin to bring these
teams here-whos going to put it up
hesmiled in his condescending fash-
ion why the athletic committee of
course he said tiddle-the-winks has
been officially adopted as a recognized
sport and as such the committee has
already voted it a sum sufficient to
cover all our expenses for apparatus
traveling and incidentals

  the committees gone crazy i
gasped real money for tiddle-the-
winks when they wouldnt give us a
measly little three thousand for new
shells last spring

  the humming bird grinned you
forget that the committee is composed
of members of the faculty mac he
said professor smith is a very good
friend of mine and he is intensely in-
terested in tiddle-the-winks-he plays
a perfectly magnificent game himself
you ought to see him-hes a genius
with the tiddle and no wink seems to
have terrors for him 

  and youre actually going to have
intercollegiate matches in this thing
i demanded where

  in the gymnasium of course said
the humming bird the seating ar-
rangements there will be adequate to
accommodate the spectators and the
lighting is excellent too

  spectators i gasped do you
mean to say you expect anybody to
come and watch you play tiddle-the-
winks 

  anybody said the humming bird
calmly who has seventy-five cents with
which to buy a ticket

  i let him dream on-i didnt have
the heart to wake him up

  from that time on the tiddle-the-


top-notch magazine

winks squad enjoyed all the privileges
of the other college teams they had
lockers in the gym space for their
tables eye shades thumb guards all
sizes and shapes of tiddles and fifty-
seven different varieties of winks half
the faculty used to watch the practice
and nosey smith who was famous
for his hatred of all forms of athletics
actually coached the varsity team in
person

  of course the humming bird as
the discoverer of the sport and the
founder of the league had to be on
the varsity and i must admit that he
deserved his place the way he could
make those little chips hop into the cup
was wonderful especially when one
saw how hard it was for the rest of the
team to do it

  time after time shark poofer who
was the next best player would miss
his tiddle but isaac newton hardly
ever did the winks would jump up
in the air under his tiddling as though
he had trained them it wasnt bad fun
to watch them even for me and it got
to be such a fad in college to watch the
tiddle-the-winks practice that the crew
coach entered a complaint with the com-
mittee saying that he couldnt get a
squad together because all the men were
either trying for the tiddle-wink team
or watching it practice think of it

  well by the time the first big game
came along-yale it wras-the hum-
ming bird had developed as deft a lot
of tiddlers as youd want to see and
trained them to a tiddle no one on
the squad was allowed to sit up after
midnight to study and participation in
all other forms of athletics was rigidly
prohibited too because isaac newton
claimed that muscular development
lessened a mans delicacy of touch with
the tiddle

  i dont know of course how it wras
at yale but they must have been in-
terested almost as much as we were
for a whole crowd of rooters came

along with their team wearing blue
ribbons and escorting girls with big
bunches of violets for all the world like
a football-game day and whats more
they wanted to bet on the game too
and tried to get us to offer odds by
telling how their center tiddle had
sprained his wrist and their right wink
had developed a case of pink eye and
wouldnt be able to last the game out
it was exactly as they send out the
calamity reports during football season
till you get yourself convinced that
everybody in new haven is in the in-
firmary and then have to walk home
because you allowed yourself to bet
on it

  we were wise though i knew bet-
ter than to risk my money on any sport
the humming bird was mixed up in
and only a few of the hottest sports put
up anything on our team alftiough
isaac newton swore to me by all the
academic gods that there was nothing to
it but a brunswick landslide he was
so certain of winning that i suddenly
got suspicious

  have you been ringing in any of
your scientific stuff hum i de-
manded watching him narrowly any
hidden springs or psychology stunts due
to come off to-night

  he just grinned knowingly as i
invented the sport and wrote the rules
myself he hinted it seems reasonable
to suppose that i did not bar out in-
ventive ability doesnt it you wait
and see

  and that was all i could get out of
him

chapter iv

the winning wink

the gym was packed beside the
big yale delegation and the visiting
girls every student in brunswick who
could borrow seventy-five cents was
holding down one of the seats in the
temporary grand stands erected each
trained to a tiddle



 fall for the basket-ball team and
 the running track overhead was just
 crammed with reserved seats at a large
 round dollar apiece

   the athletic treasurer was all smiles
 and told me as i went in that the
 receipts had already repaid the ex-
 penses of the team brunswick had
 gone tiddle-wink crazy-that was all
 there was to it

   according to the rules devised by
 the humming bird the game was
 played on a long green-covered table
 set up in the center of the gym floor
 with shaded lights suspended above it
 yale had one side of the table and we
 had the other there were five men on
 each side a center tiddle a right and
 left tiddle and a right and left wink
 the winks were arranged in a line in
 front of the right winks and left winks
 who sat at the opposite ends of the
 table-about six feet from the cup

  play began when poofer playing
 right wink for us tiddled the first wink
 clear up to the cup on a splendid shot
 the yale left wink playing opposite to
 him tried to equal his performance but
 only succeeded in dropping his wink in
 front of the left tiddle and it was the
 humming birds next shot for bruns-
 wick he snapped the wink plump into
 the cup while the yale tiddle man-
 aged to give his wink only a short re-
 lay along to the yale tiddle our left
 wink in his turn shooting his first disk
 clear up to the cup just as poofer had
 done

   that gives an idea of how the game
 is played-each side getting a shot in
 turn and the winks working in from
 the ends of the table toward the cup
 a good long tiddle-off therefore meant
 that the center tiddle would get a shot
 for the cup on the next play while a
 short tiddle-off might necessitate two or
 three intermediate tiddles before the
 wink went home each side had to
 cage six winks three from each end
  and the first to get all its winks home

won the game six games made a set
and the best three out of five sets made
the match

  well that match was a simple rout
not once did the yale end winks suc-
ceed in propelling their tiddle-ofifs far
enough for their center tiddle to make
his goal play on the second shot al-
ways they had to be relayed along by
the middle tiddlers while our end winks
several times cupped the wink  the
tiddle-off and never failed once to lay
the wink within easy distance of the
cup where isaac newton could shoot
it home on the next play

  although it was a walk-over for
brunswick im bound to admit it was
exciting and i yelled as loud as any of
them when the first half ended with our
side already two straight sets to the
good

  during the intermission though i
felt a little foolish and walked out for
a breath of fresh air a trifle ashamed
of myself for yielding to the fascina-
tion of such a silly childs game right
outside the door i bumped into jayne
even in the darkness i could see that he
was mad and i stopped to see what on
earth was the matter with him

  dont speak to me you big brute
he snapped

  i was astonished why what have
you got against me i expostulated

  you put the humming bird up to
this wretched game said jayne

  well what if i did i asked puz-
zled didnt i save your precious
basket-ball squad by doing it

  save it save it he wrailed
why you dolt dont you know whats
happened  the committee has abol-
ished basket ball and disbanded the
team because they say one indoor sport
is enough and they need the gym for
the tiddle-wink games and anyway
all the basket-ball squad had gone out
for the tiddle-wink team and i couldnt
have got five men to play no matter
what the committee did

  and poor old jayne almost sobbed
outright in the depth of his grief i
couldnt cheer him up try as i would
until i finally thought of a bright idea
i borrowed seventy-five cents of smead
and bought jayne a ticket he sat
watching the second half like a man
whos seen a great white light and
before the third set was half over he
was screeching away like a lunatic the
game wound up in a wild uproar of
frenzied cheering and i heard him yell-
ing diefenberger  diefenberger at
the top of his lungs

  you dont hate the humming bird
any more do you i said a little an-
noyed at him for his sudden switch
he scowled at me superciliously

  hate him he snapped hes a
wonder as a brunswick man im
proud of him did you see the per-
fectly splendid play he made at the end 
think of it from the eight-inch line
with a bad angle against him to tiddle
the winning wink for brunswick 

chapter v

when science aids

h said the humming bird airily
it was nothing very wonderful i
claim none of the credit for the victory
it was all a matter of cold science mac
and science always wins

  i thought so i exclaimed you
rang in some of your underhand scien-
tific cheating did you after all i
should think youd be ashamed hum
dont you understand that that sort of
thing isnt fair

  did you examine the table said
isaac newton i thought i saw you
look at the legs and bottom of it before
the game did you see any evidence
of concealed wiring or anything else
that struck you as unfair 

  no i didnt i said but youve
just admitted that you played some
low-down scientific trick to win what
was it this time

  isaac newton smiled condescendingly
and threw me a couple of clippings
one was a copy of his own tiddle-wink
rules do you see that paragraph
which says that the winks may be made
of any material whatever-wood cel-
luloid rubber or metal he asked

  i nodded

  well ours were celluloid-yales
had a little chunk of steel in the center
-thats all and the rules specifically
allow that is that unfair-the weight
being the same in each case

  no i said slowly but whats
this other clipping-the bartenders
life-saver whats the bartender got
to do with this

  read the advertisement said isaac
newton  i found it in a saloon trade
journal it explains a simple magnetic
contrivance by which the bartender can
control the fall of loaded dice-many
saloons employ it i am told to save
them the free drinks they would other-
wise lose

  but there were no wires on that
table i protested i can swear to
that and you cant work a thing like
that without wires

  thats because you dont know pro-
fessor smith well enough said the
humming bird he suggested that
we cover our tables with an iron plate
below the green baize we did and
we took the liberty of magnetizing the
plate permanently first the rules do
not prohibit it mac i wrote them my-
self science rightly applied always
wins mac even in a highly sporting
game like tiddle-the-winks

tavish who has been complaining

  pierre picked up a taper and in an-
other moment he had kindled a light
which threw the whole interior into re-
lief an iron cage had been introduced
into the secret chamber and from be-
tween its bars a human face peered
forth through a thatch of hair and beard
uncut for months

  the baron de tartas rose in his place
and bowed low permit me to greet
you my dear comte said he

  you devil was the counts re-
sponse

  tut tut this is very foolish but
i will pass it over since you are so
young let me see how old are you 
the man in the cage made no reply
let me see youwere twenty-three

when-

  when you betrayed and trapped
me put in the prisoner

  and you have enjoyed my hospital-
ity for just eleven months you are
therefore twenty-four years old by
the way pierre when did mohsieur le
comte dine last

  on tuesday monsieur le baron
said pierre

  and this is thursday exclaimed
the baron tut tut he must be hun-
gry  take him a cup of this excellent
soup pierre

  pierre did as he was bidden and
passed a cup of soup through the bars

inner had just commenced
for the baron de tartas he
sat alone in front of a heavy
table a single attendant stood
behind his chair from time
to time he lifted his dark bearded face
and laughed as a man does who enjoys
a cynical recollection but there was no
mirth in the laughter nor any glint of
humor in the hard black eyes

  pierre he called

  yes monsieur le baron was the
reply

  i grow lonely i must have com-
pany

  yes monsieur le baron came the
same reply

  is the comte andre de lavelle at
home asked the baron

  yes monsieur le baron repeated
the man with a grin

  then i shall be glad of his com- -
pany

  pierre crossed the room and touched
or seemed to touch a spring in the wall
for a panel backed with iron on which
was painted a scene of the chase slipped
back disclosing an aperture behind it
across the mouth of this aperture
which evidently belonged to a secret
chamber thick iron bars showed in the
lamplight

the wretched prisoner seized it and
swallowed jthe liquid

  you love life sneered the baron
watching him

  while i live i hope said the count

  for what my good fool was the
next question

  that some day-some day you may
lie at my mercy

  the baron laughed long and loudly
you are of a sanguine disposition he
remarked then turning to pierre
go i desire a tete-a-tete with mon-
sieur

  as soon as they were alone the baron
helped himself to a huge grilled bone
when he had cut off the greater part of
the meat he caught up the bone and
hurled it at the man in the cage
there he cried feast and be
merry

  the bone struck the bars and fell to
the ground the baron de tartas with
his eyes fixed on the prisoner continued
his dinner dish after dish he ate and
pushed away then at last he poured
out a great bumper of wine and drained
it

  and now said he as he set it down
i have news for you my dear comte
i saw mademoiselle to-day she is more
beautiful than ever

  the prisoner in the cage who had
been sitting facing his tormentor turned
his back deliberately de tartas smiled
it may interest you to know that i
asked her whether she had changed her
mind and would become my wife

  the man in the cage sprang up and
she refused i know it she refused
with contempt and scorn 

  not at all my dear andre you are
wrong she accepted-on one condi-
tion

  what was that condition asked
the prisoner

  a condition which she thought im-
possible but which we know is by no
means so replied his tormentor
smoothly she imagines that you are

not dead and declares she will never
accept me until she hears you renounce
her with your own lips

  i will die first cried the count

  no doubt my young friend but
unfortunately for you it is not a ques-
tion of dying but of living-ten twenty
-perhaps thirty-years like a black-
bird in that comfortable cage you
fool on the day when first i saw you
cast your eyes on adrienne i had this
chamber prepared on the day she con-
sented to marry you the cage was placed
in it twenty days later my men way-
laid you as you rode singing through
the woods as to adrienne she does
not know what has become of you any
more than the rest of the world always
excepting the good pierre and myself
but one day she shall know-one day

  the baron laughed suddenly and
harshly ah if she saw you now what
would she think of you would she
love you still you have changed from
the debonair creature she remembers
the curling dark hair the clear
bronzed cheeks where are they but
i forget you have not seen your-
self 

  de tartas seized a mirror and cross-
ing the floor held it up to the cage
in it andre saw reflected a thing hardly
human a wolfish face snarling from a
mass of tangled hair he recoiled

  you give me an idea she shall see
you cried de tartas she shall see
you will she rush into your arms i
wonder as she did under the chestnut
trees 

ii

the baron de tartas could climb on
the clearest day to the highest
tower of his castle and north south
east and west as far as he could see
stretched his own land and over its
cowering inhabitants he held the right
of the high justice the middle and the
low far from the capital and shut in
by his mountains and forests he lived
tart as the terrible



practically the life of a robber chief-
tain a last survivor of those the fear of
whom once lay heavy upon the country-
side he was indeed a terrible man
and at sight of his cold eyes and pointed
beard the children slunk into the thick-
ets and their parents trembled in the
sunlight

  de tartas was forty-three years old
when first he saw adrienne de carteret
and from that hour he set himself to
win her apart from her great beauty
she was well worth the winning for
she possessed broad lands in her own
right her father was dead and she
lived with her mother in the chateau
of noirmont

  at first de tartas who could be very
pleasant when he so desired had seamed
to make some headway in her good
graces but at the coming of the young
comte de lavelle all was changed

  the handsome youths who possessed
nothing but a few hundred barren acres
in one of the farther of the pyrenean
valleys came and saw and conquered
and was conquered in his turn de
tartas found himself slighted as he
conceived and forgotten as he most
truly was and then one day young
de lavelle had gone hunting in the dark
mountain woods and from that hunt
he never returned for de tartas men
had waylaid and captured him after a
desperate fight and he was thrust
bleeding and wounded into the cage
which had been prepared for him

  a story was circulated afterward by
the retainers of the baron that lavelle
had been slain by a bear but of course
his body was not recovered and ad-
rienne continued to hope against hope
that one day he would return to her

  after a decent interval de tartas re-
newed his suit but adrienne would not
listen to him exclaiming that if andre
were dead she would die unmarried
and when de tartas hinted that the
young man had loved and ridden away
she swore she would never believe that

andre was fickle until she heard him re-
nounce her with his own lips

  such was the position of affairs on
the summer evening when the baron
held the mirror to his prisoners eyes

iii

the baron de tartas rode out from
his castle gate and struck across
the hills for noirmont he had made
up his mind to try a new move in his
game and he passed slowly arid
thoughtfully through winding valleys
along forested hillsides and stony ra-
vines till the sun was high and he
found himself overlooking a green hol-
low beyond which rose the heights of
noirmont-the dark mountain that gave
its name to adriennes home this was
a huge castellated building that stood
out boldly upon one of the lower spurs
of the mountain

  as de tartas urged his horse up the
steep roadway to the gate he argued
with himself that fate who favors the
brave should by all the rules of chance
be with him in the daring bid for suc-
cess that he was about to make he
believed that he had fathomed adri-
ennes character gauged her strength
and her weakness and on this knowl-
edge he relied

  she came through the shadows of the
vaulted hall to meet him and he trem-
bled as he bent over her hand and kissed
it for his hopes were risen high and
he was shaken by the thought that this
beautiful girl soon might be his wife

  she shuddered and withdrew her
hand but looked straight at him with
eyes as deeply blue as the summer sky
from the folds of lace crossed upon
her bosom her round neck rose proudly
its ivory accentuated by the splendor of
her dark hair

  am i then so hateful to you he
asked stepping back a pace as if to
make her look at him

  and in fact he was a personable

magazine

man for though no taller than herself
he had the torso and shoulders of a
hercules his lean large-featured face
was far from uncomely and once he
had fancied that she had looked with
kindness on him

  she shook her head slightly as if his
question needed no answer my mother
is sleeping she is wearied and ill she
said

  it is you mademoiselle with whom
i must speak he replied is it not
time you ceased to mourn for monsieur
de lavelle

  i must always mourn for him said
adrienne

  i can bear that but give yourself to
me pleaded the baron the years
must teach you comfort the law of the
world is the law of change

  i have told you that i do not believe
that he is dead and that i will never
give him up wntil his own lips disclaim
my promise

  in that case i have news for you
said de tartas

  the blood slowly left her face he
is alive she asked

  yes replied the baron

  i have always felt it for a mo-
ment she stood too moved to speak
then the words came who told you 
how did you find out where is he
de tartas smiled as he watched her
with his cold eyes you are asking a
great many questions mademoiselle in
my turn i will ask you one only it is
this why should i tell you 

  she turned a gaze of horror upon
him he wilted a little under its re-
proach

  mademoiselle he continued every
man must fight for his own hand since
there is never another to fight for him
and you know that though monsieur
de lavelle is so fortunate as to possess
your love to-day i still have hopes
which can never be fulfilled said
the girl coldly

  exactly-which you say can never

be fulfilled but what if i were to find
a way to change your resolves perhaps
even your affections

   it is not possible she told him

  will you permit me to make the
attempt asked de tartas

  to what end no monsieur le
baron i will not permit you to make
the attempt seeing it would be useless

  you forget that if you refuse to ac-
cept my terms you will hear no more
of monsieur de lavelle suggested her
suitor

  she looked at him with loathing and
contempt what are your terms
she asked

  come to my chateau and i will an-
swer your questions and tell you all i
know of the whereabouts of the comte
de lavelle promised the baron

  my mother is not well enough to
make the journey parried adrienne

  there is no need for her to do so
you must come alone you can return
before dawn

  you ask me to come at night and
in secret exclaimed the girl in aston-
ishment you know it is impossible
i will not

  pierre shall meet you in the valley
and bring you back again said de
tartas

  then as she stared at him the baron
bowed low before her i go made-
moiselle said he but i will return to-
morrow if you do not then agree to
my condition you will never hear of
your lover again

iv

adrienne met de tartas on the
terrace when he came again do
you mean to trust me he asked

  how can i be certain that it is not
all a lie this news you promised me of
monsieur de lavelle she said uncer-
tainly

  by this de tartas put his hand
to his breast and drew out a minia-
ture
tartas the terrible



  adrienne could not suppress a cry
it was a likeness of herself which she
had given to de lavelle after their be-
trothal he is dead he never would
have parted with this while he lived

  i swear to you that he lives made-
moiselle and i will add this-it may be
that he is in danger he may perhaps
be saved if-

  i will come to-night she inter-
rupted hastily

  that is well approved the baron
the moon rises in good time it will
show you the path along the valley and
pierre shall be waiting for you by the
dent-du-chat au revoir mademoi-
selle

  the baron de tartas strode into his
gloomy hall he had been watching for
the last two hours from his battlements
and had just seen under the dent-du-
chat the flicker of the little beacon
which he had ordered pierre to light
as a signal that adrienne was on her
way

  in the hall a sumptuous feast was laid
out upon the table a roast lamb stood
at one end facvd by a young swan of
which the baron kept many pinioned
upon his waters dishes of fruit and
beakers of wine glinted and shone in
the flaring lights de tartas glanced
at the preparations and nodded his head
in satisfaction then he stepped across
and touched the spring which rolled
back the secret panel and disclosed the
cage upon the straw-strewn floor of
which crouched de lavelle

  ah my dear comte said he you
will perceive that my table is laid for
two

  the prisoner did not move de tar-
tas laughed i doubt if even your
quick intelligence could guess the name
of the visitor i am about to have the
honor of entertaining

  still the prisoner did not move many
a time had de tartas tortured him with
the sight of food

   it is just eleven oclock continued
the baron eleven at night for i sup-
pose it is necessary to add that-since
except when in my great mercy i push
back the panel you pass your time like
a mole in the darkness

   still the prisoner lay inert upon the
straw

  ah said the baron i see that i
must tell you exactly what has occurred
yesterday i did myself the honor of
visiting mademoiselle adrienne and of
telling her that i had news of you

  you told her that said the pris-
oner in a hollow voice

  yes indeed said the baron and
i added that if she would come here
to-night i would communicate this

 m	

news

  adrienne here to-night cried the
prisoner

  the baron laughed does not her
coming rejoice you will she not be
overjoyed to meet you once again  can
you doubt it since you have seen your-
self as you now are she who is so
proud so fastidious but enough of
that when you see her you will tell
her that you no longer love her and
that you give her back her promise if
you do this you shall be set free before
morning

  and if i refuse demanded the
prisoner

  why then we shall enjoy ourselves
together for many years to come-you
and i be wise my dear comte the
sunshine and the winds are so very
pleasant not that the choice will be
a very difficult one for she will spurn
you and loathe you but there are one
or two details concerning the reasons
which have caused me to put you in this
cage that i shall expect you to corrob-
orate first then i captured you not
because mademoiselle adrienne loved
you and i loved mademoiselle adrienne
-oh no but because although you
were betrothed to her you were paying
your addresses to diane loiseau the


top-notch magazine

daughter f one of my foresters i
hearing of this and being naturally and
righteously enraged at your perfidy
seized you and punished you do you
ttnderstand 

  you wish me to acknowledge and
bear witness to the truth of these lies
before mademoiselle de carteret you
forget that she will question this
diane said the count scornfully

  she will say anything that i tell
her the baron assured him under-
stand that you have your choice it
is not a hard one on the one side
freedom on the other such a life as
few have endured since the beginning
of the world ah that must be pierre
they have come

  the barons quick ear had caught the
sound of horses in the courtyard he
pressed the spring and the panel shot
forward hiding the cage

  soon after pierre threw- open the
door it is mademoiselle said he

  good go wait with the horses
in the courtyard see that they are
fed

  meantime adrienne had advanced
into the room pale though she was
she made a beautiful picture with her
blue eyes and her raven hair against
the dark and rugged background of the
somber hall of de tartas who kissed
her hand with an exaggeration of
respect

  you will eat after your ride said
he see i have drawn upon all the
resources of my poor estate

  i am grateful replied adrienne
but i am not hungry i have come
here for a purpose i desire to fulfill
that purpose and then depart

  tut tut cried the baron i shall
take it ill if you thus refuse my hospi-
tality on this your first visit to my poor
chateau come sit down and taste some
of this swan that has fattened in a lake
surrounded by chestnut trees and on
the shores of which are beds of wild
celery

  adrienne sighed and the two took 
their seats at the table

v

the baron had arranged the lights
so that they fell full upon his vis-
itors lovely face from which even as
he ate and drank he hardly removed
his eyes again and again adrienne
tried to lead the conversation in the
direction that she desired but the baron
baffled her with his laughter and his
boasting of his woods and his deer and
of the bears and wolves he had slain-
for the man was a great hunter and
after his infatuation for adrienne the
chase was the passion of his life

  at length however the meal was
over and adrienne broke out have
you lured me here with a lie that you
evade all my questions

  your pardon mademoiselle he an-
swered courteously i am sorry if i
have offended you i will make imme-
diate reparation you desire to know
many things concerning monsieur de
lavelle you shall know them all
first then i have the honor to inform
you that monsieur de lavelle is here
and has been here during the last eleven
months

  what cried adrienne this is
incredible why have you kept him
hidden

  for a very good reason mademoi-
selle i must ask you to listen to the
facts of the case they are simple
you will hear me

  adrienne inclined her head

  you must know then that from the
day i saw you i loved you no no
mademoiselle do not interrupt me-
for adrienne had made a movement of
anger-it is all part of what i have to
tell you i say that i loved you and
until the coming of this de lavelle it
may be that you looked not unkindly
upon me but before long i realized
that for you there was but one man in
the world and mademoiselle such was
tartas the terrible



my love for you that i was willing it
should be so provided i could assure
myself that that man was indeed worthy
of the great good fortune which had
befallen him

  once i was assured of this i de-
cided that i would wish you happiness
for the last time and retire here to my
hunting and solitude and my memories
of you but i am the lord of no small
domain and whatever may occur within
my marches comes to my ears sooner
or later-generally sooner dear made-
mdiselle

  and now my men told me that you
were not the only woman for andre de
lavelle there lives over yonder-
the baron waved his hand to the east-
a certain forester jean oiseau he
has a daughter diane is her name of
whose beauty even you in your chateau
of noirmont may have heard well
they told me that your betrothed when
he left you rode straight to the hut in
the forest and spent the evenings of the
days he passed with you wandering
through the woods his arm around her
and his black locks mingled with her
golden ones

  do you expect me to believe that
asked adrienne scornfully

  you will believe it before you leave
this hall the baron assured her but
let me continue when i learned of
de lavelles treachery rage overpow-
ered me and at first it was in my mind
to ride to you i should have done so
had i not realized and rightly it seems
that you would laugh me to scorn so
i thought of another way in which i
might save you near the hut of jean
the forester i placed an ambush and
presently the fox was in the trap his
lips were upon dianes when they cap-
tured him and dragged him before me
he flung himself upon the ground and
begged me to keep silence yes he
offered to renounce you if i would let
him go but my wrath was to be meas-

ured only by my love and swayed by
it i cast him into prison

  and then-then asked the girl
breathlessly

  i treated him as he deserved did
i do right said de tartas

  you left me without word of him
all these months  she cried

  for your own sake i knew how
painful it would be to you to realize
that you had been betrothed to a crea-
ture so unworthy-a traitor

  i thank you but i condemn no man
unheard said mademoiselle proudly
you say that andre is imprisoned
here i must see him and permit him
to defend himself

  i was about to suggest that you
should do so returned the baron
smoothly

  she had been far from expecting this
easy acquiescence in that case the
sooner the better shall i accompany
you she added for the baron had
risen

  there is no need i keep him close
to me and watch over him very care-
fully with these words de tartas
left the table and walked slowly across
the hall

  when he arrived opposite the secret
spring he turned and faced adrienne
who was following his movements with
a gaze of mingled agony and expecta-
tion then as he touched it the panel
drew back into its socket de tartas
lifted a lamp

  there  cried he there is the trai-
tor who insulted you

  the figure in the cage rose to its
knees blinking for the sudden change
from utter darkness to light rendered
him blind for a moment the next he
seized the bars of the cage shaking and
tearing at them like some imprisoned
animal

  adrienne stood still the horror of
the moment completely deprived her of
the power of speech at last words
came who is this who is this


top-notch magazine

  you de not recognize comte andre
de lavelle  mocked de tartas

  oh it cannot be it is impossible
andre andre it is not you-it can-
not be you she cried

  adrienne it is indeed i came an-
dres voice

  adrienne turned on de tartas you
have done this this there is no word
i know that would describe you

  all for your sake mademoiselle
said the baron you forget that and
you have not questioned him ask him
of the kisses he gave to diane oiseau
and of how he confessed to me that he
cared not for you but for your posses-
sions

  andre cried adrienne tell me
this is not true i know you too well
it is a lie a wild invention tell me
and i will believe you oh my andre
my poor andre tell me

  your andre repeated the man in
the cage do you mean that he
said you would turn from me with
hatred and disgust that you would
loathe the sight of me who have no
longer the appearance of a human
being

  bah cried the baron you see
how he shirks an answer if you do
not answer at once i will press this
spring

  then i will answer most noble am-
brose baron de tartas and high sei-
gneur of jaurac replied the prisoner
contemptuously you have said that
i walked in the woods with diane loi-
seau and that i renounced the lady
adrienne in my fear of what you might
do to me in your righteous indigna-
tion i will answer oh yes i will an-
swer that charge diane i never heard
of till an hour ago when you told me
that if i acknowledged my love for her
i should be free before dawn as to
the renunciation which you commanded
me to make i have this to say i love
the lady adrienne and her only and
her i will continue to love until death

  the baron sprang forward do you
understand what you say he cried
then seeing in adriennes eyes how ut-
terly his plan had miscarried he broke
into uncontrollable rage do you re-
alize that the words you have spoken
condemn you to spend the rest of your
life where you are

  i shall at least have the sweet mem-
ory of your chagrin to keep me com-
pany said the prisoner

  have no fear andre i will raise
the countryside i will rescue you
cried adrienne

  the baron smiled the castle can
stand a two years siege said he even
if you can prevail upon people to come
and besiege it which i think you will
find it hard to do besides i will deny
that monsieur de lavelle is here

  and i will tell every one that i saw
him myself said the girl

  do not forget to add the fact that
the hour at which you saw him was
in the middle of the night and that you
came alone of your own free will to the
chateau de tartas the baron re-
minded her

  a haughty smile crossed adriennes
features can you imagine that i will
shrink from telling the whole truth
said she

  adrienne adrienne you give me
courage to die not once but many
times cried andre

  you will need it said the baron
grimly and now mademoiselle my
last word wed me- and this man
shall have his liberty refuse and re-
turn home and when you lie upon your
bed think that he and i are together
and that some of the old implements of
torture which my ancestors used so
wisely are still to be found in my castle
those thoughts will give you pleasant
dreams and now i will leave you to
talk it over and to make your choice
you shall have ten minutes together i
will wait in the next room
tartas the terrible



vi

the moment they were alone adri-
enne rushed forward and caught
the hand which andre had thrust
through the bars and covered it with
kisses

  there is no one like you in the
world adrienne he told her

  can i not free you she asked
no he carries the key upon his per-
son 

  it may be possible to break the pad-
lock suggested adrienne frantically

  to do so would need the strength of
six men and is far beyond yours
adrienne how did you find the cour-
age to come here  do you realize the
risks you have run for my sake

  i am running no risks she said
calmly

  what do you mean 

  i have a vial of poison  brought
it in case-in case he should refuse to
let me go

  poison whispered andre you
have a vial of poison  where 

  in my bosom

  then i pray you to put some of it
in a cup of wine and give it to me
once i am dead his threats will have
no power for you

  but adriennes eyes were blazing
with a light that andre de lavelle had
never seen there before she crossed
swiftly to the table and lifted the great
flagon of tarragona wine that stood
upon it from this she poured out a
cup and then shielding the flagon with
her body from any gaze which might
be turned upon it from the direction of
the door she emptied into it the vial of
poison next with a firm step she went
to the door and called out the name of
the baron

it was a full minute before he came
for he had gone to give some orders to
pierre as he entered the hall adri-
enne spoke i have decided said she
and your decision asked her host

  that i will marry you when and
where you wish and lifting the cup
of tarragona wine she drank it to its
dregs and so i pledge you my lord
and master

  the baron stared for a moment then
springing forward he filled a cup from
the great flagon and turning to his
prisoner who was clinging to the bars
and pressing his bearded face against
them he shouted  she comes readily
to my arms does she not my most
dear comte i drink i drink deep to
the loveliest of wives

  de tartas placed the cup empty
upon the table then seized with a new
thought he filled it again

  and you too shall drink-you
too he cried and he handed it through
the bars of the cage

  andre de lavelle took it and held it
up as if about to drink

  for a moment adriennes heart stood
still for she had no idea how long the
poison would need for its work and
she knew that did the baron suspect
anything all hope would be over but
de lavelle was equal to the occasion
with a wild gesture he dashed the cup
to the floor of his cage

  i do not drink from the cup that
has been touched by the lips of a trai-
tor 

  the baron laughed as you wish
those lips have other work to do he
said and advanced toward adrienne

  she shrank back from him and then
as he still came on she saw that his
steps were not steady and that his eyes
were filled with a strange wildness he
caught her in his arms she struggled
fighting him off suddenly without
warning his jaws snapped together and
he fell forward upon his face

  he carries the key in his belt said
the prisoner

  in a moment more adrienne had
opened the cage and blessing her name
andre de lavelle crept across the
threshold it was the first time for

eleven months so he could not stand
upright but shambled round the hall
with uncouth and hesitating paces

  he came to the body of the baron
he is not dead he cried see he
moves de tartas eyes were open
and his hands groped feebly de la-
velle bent over him he is recover-
ing the poison was much diluted in
the great flagon he cried again ah
heaven is not unjust after all

  he plucked the pistol from the
barons belt and put it in the breast of
his own shirt afterward with a
strength born of fury which none could
have believed him to possess he dragged
de tartas to the cage and thrust him
into it locking the door upon him then
he touched the secret spring and the
panel shot back

  however loudly he shouts he will
not be heard the triple iron deadens
all sound

  quick andre let us leave this
dreadful place cried adrienne
where are the horses  he asked
pierre is waiting with them in the
courtyard r

  swiftly they passed down the stair
and stood in the shadow of the arch in
the courtyard they could see two horses
tied to rings in the wall but pierre was
not visible they ran across untied the
bridles and mounted

  away adrienne my darling ride
on said andre i follow

  without a word adrienne turned her
horse down the steep incline from the
castle gate and soon they were flying
along the track between the chestnut
trees

  andre de lavelle watched until a
bend in the road hid her from his sight
then he lifted up his voice and shouted
pierre

  coming monsieur le baron com-
ing called out a voice and a man
rubbing the sleep from his eyes ran
out from a firelit doorway in which he
had been snoring

   de lavelle wrapped in the barons
 cloak sat in the saddle with the pistol
 aimed carefully over the crook of his
 arm at the shot pierre fell then
 lavelle gave rein to his horse and gal-
 loped after adrienne

   by dawn two of the three human be-
 ings alive who knew the secret of the
 cage were nearing noirmont the
 third was beating the bars with bleed-
 ing hands and screaming pierre

 pierre pierre

   but pierre came not and the thick
 walls held their secret for many a year

 i saw a man once said a well-known
 humorist fall off the top window
 sill in a building twenty stories high
 never hurt himself a bit-just annoyed
 that was all

   nonsense cried his companion
 the thing is impossible

   fact said the humorist up there
 he was cleaning the window and he
 fell right off he got up and went back
 tohis work

   thats absurd exclaimed the other
 man tell me how he did it

   well you see drawled the humor-
 ist it was rather lucky for him-but
 he happened to fall inside

the need of experience

 a farmers horse nearly went
 crazy the first time it saw an auto-
 mobile passing by the farm the
 farmer with the help of a stranger
 managed at last to pacify the animal

   you silly beast exclaimed the
 stranger giving the horse a light smack
 with the reins

   oh the horse has sense enough
 said the farmer what he wants is
 experience how would you feel if you
 saw your trousers walking off down the
 road without anything in em
ell bred well educated
well built and well provided
with the things of this world
tommy langham had all the
necessary attributes of the
prince in the fairy tale combined with
an inherited hard common sense which
rendered him practical beyond the pos-
sibilities of either princes or fairies

  tommys father had left him an in-
come which precluded all necessity of
work and tommys common sense pre-
served him from the folly of striving
for more when what he had was
enough possessed of a genial philoso-
phy he took life easily content to fol-
low the lines of least resistance such
things as he wanted and his money
would buy he had immediately and be-
ing far too practical to yearn for full
moons he never had seriously wanted
anything his money would not buy un-
til his lines became entangled with those
of miss daisy arnold

  tommy did not lack in a sense of
his own intrinsic value though here
again his common sense preserved him
from undue mental elevation and when
miss arnold refused him the first time
he retired with a feeling bordering upon

astonishment this  was hardly the
proper attitude for a man in his posi-
tion and goes to show that daisy was
right in her answer

  for the better part of a month
tommy struggled to recognize miss
arnold as a full moon which he did not
want then he pocketed his pride and
asked her again and was again refused
he went away with less astonishment
and a growing feeling that after all
there must be something wrong with
hhn which was at least wholesome

  the process was repeated at short
intervals during the following two
months until tommy was reduced to
amazement at his own splendid audacity
in thinking that she might even for a
moment consider him a matrimonial
possibility

  he had just screwed his courage up
to the point for the fifth or sixth trial
and anxiously awaited her answer she
was hesitating more than he had grown
accustomed to expect and his hopes
rose only to be dashed dismally to
earth

  oh tommy she said finally its
got to be the same answer i like you
so much i wish you wouldnt


top-notch magazine

  im sorry said tommy meekly i
dont seem able to help it

  the trouble is i like men who do
things she cried dont you see what
i mean tommy youre so good-na-
tured and-and easy-going sometimes
i wonder if youd even stand up for
your rights

  i am an easy mark i suppose ad-
mitted tommy i hate to row you
know

  that isnt exactly what i mean it
isnt necessary to raise a row as you
call it but a girl does like to see a man
show some spunk now dont be of-
fended tommy because i like you a
lot or i wouldnt be saying this to you
thank you said tommy meekly
now lets change the subject said
daisy youll be in the race to-mor-
row wont you

  oh i suppose so said tommy
mr ackers seems very sure he will
win

  hes got a good boat said tommy
generously

  he says that in windward work
shell beat anything in the bay

 maybe she will said tommy
whose mind was searching other roads
the girl talked on more or less at ran-
dom filling in time while tommy
answered in monosyllables questions
which he only half heard

  daisy he suddenly broke out if i
could find some way of proving to you
that im not as-slipshod as you think

would it-

  it might make a difference admit-
ted the girl doubtfully tommys face
fell i was just wondering she
added hastily whether i could like you
any better than i do you know if-
you were any different and tommy
went away sorely puzzled to know just
what she meant by that

  he walked slowly down to the club-
house hunted up dicky carman and
unburdened his soul to his chum

 hm said dicky you know

whats the trouble dont you sidney
ackers is hanging round her day and
night

  that cad said tommy

  just so my son that cad hes a
fellow that does things its up to you
to beat him at his own game

  i cant very well punch his head
said tommy unconsciously thinking
still along the lines of least resistance

  hardly said dicky though he
needs it do you know what i heard
him say yesterday said hed rather
foul another boat any day than lose a
race fair thats sportsmanlike isnt
it

  well that doesnt help me any
said tommy disconsolately

il

there were five boats entered in the
race for the commodores cup the
following day tommys comet ack-
ers alpha the norma the helfyr and
a boat from down the bay called fhe
spanking sallie nothing was known
about this last entry but of the other
four the comet and the alpha had
proven themselves the better boats dur-
ing the season with the latter leading
by two races won

  in the comet tommy held the tiller
dicky tended sheet and there were six
young fellows besides to sling the fifty-
pound sand bags up to the weather gun-
wale when the boat went about and to
hang over the rail as live ballast and
hold her down if need arose

  daisy arnold came down the pier as
they were preparing to put off t ommy
stopped operations and went forward

  going to have plenty of wind she
said	

  thats all we hope answered
tommy

  mr ackers still thinks hes going to

   	aj

win

  well well try and give him a race
said tommy noncommittally
on the starboard tack



  the committee boat chugged away
from the pier to takeup its station at
the starting line and tommy cast off
the comet and shoved her head around
till the sail filled

  good-by he called

  good-by said the girl and good
luck tommy and tommy went aft
and took the tiller from dicky won-
dering whether ackers had enjoyed a
similar send-off

  the course was a reach to the outer
mark with the wind on the port quar-
ter and a beat back to the finish the
wind blew steadily from the northeast
and the bay was a dark-green field
broken by lines of whitecaps over
which the big thirty-footers with their
towering sticks and spotless canvas
shot back and forth jockeying for the
start

  when the preliminary gun came
tommy had the comet well up to wind-
ward of the bunch and perhaps three
hundred yards from the line one of
the crew with a watch had been told
off to count the time between signals
and tommy put the boats head to the
wind and held her shaking drifting
slowly down upon the line

  give us the seconds on the last min-
ute he said to the timekeeper and
let the sheet run dicky when i give
the word

iii

there were five long minutes be-
tween the first two signals and
they waited nervously while the comet
drifted nearer and nearer

  one minute more said the time-
keeper and began counting out the sec-
onds five ten fifteen-

  tommys eyes were on the little brass
cannon on the deck of the committee
boat and he began to wonder whether
he had miscalculated they were drift-
ing rapidly down upon the line

  thirty-five forty forty-five-

said the timer

  let her go snapped tommy and
swung the boat around dicky paid off
the sheet as the boom swung out the
greatsail filled and gathering momen-
tum the boat shot for the line fair be-
fore the wind

  fifty-six fifty-seven fifty-eight
came the timers voice they were al-
most on the line tommy had shaved
their margin close would they beat
the gun and have to come about and
cross again it was an anxious mo-
ment

  trim her in said tommy as he
straightened the boat out on the course
a point or two off the wind

  bang came the starting gun and
going like a race horse the comet shot
past the committee boat with scarce
an instant to spare first of the five to
cross

  and thats all right said dicky en-
thusiastically

  behind them came the sallie the
alpha and the norma close together
with the helfyr trailing the crews sat
in the bottoms of the boats and took
things easy the run to the outer mark
was practically before the wind and
there was nothing for them to do the
wind seemed to be increasingand the
comet easily held the lead from all but
the spanking sallie the dark horse
halfway to the mark she had drawn
abreast and from there on slowly
forged ahead

  looks as if she was too fast for
us said tommy

  we may do her up going back an-
swered dicky weve got the others
where we want em anyhow

  the norma meantime had fallen back
till she and the helfyr brought up the
rear and already were out of the race
barring accidents to the leaders the
alpha held her place on the comets
quarter and knowing her ability for
windward work tommy was not at all
sanguine that their lead was sufficient

  they -neared the mark in this order


top-notch magazine

the sallie leading turned the mark
short and with a curl of white water
under her forefoot went off on the star-
board tack with everything humming
it looked as if she would have things
her own way when without warning
her starboard stay parted under the
tremendous strain and to save her mast
her skipper cut the halyards and her
chances ended the great racing sail
collapsed like a torn balloon and the
leader lay wallowing iri the trough
waiting for a launch to tow her in

  that was sheer hard luck but it is
indeed an ill wind that blows nobody
good and the accident which removed
the dark horse from the race left the
comet in the lead once more to fight
it out with the alpha they were near-
ing the mark and had no time to spec-
ulate on the accident from now on
it would be hard work for everybody
aboard

  ready now with those bags called
tommy and the crew scrambled to
their feet

  now then hard alee came the
order a moment later as he jammed the
tiller over the comet spun on her
heel the boom came inboard and hung
wavering for an instant while the huge
sail flapped and dicky trimmed irrthe
slack sheet like a wild man then she
caught the wind once more the sail
filled and as she heeled to the pressure
the crew piled the sand bags out to
windward and away she went on the
port tack tearing through the white-
caps and hurling spray over deck and
cockpit till every one was drenched

  pile out now boys and hold her
down cried tommy and the crew
added their live weight to the bags
hanging precariously over the rail in the
effort to hold her down

  the alpha crossed their wake a mo-
ment later speeding for the mark
around she came and instead of fol-
lowing the comets lead stood away on
the starboard tack

  splitting tacks said dicky do
you know what hes up to  hed never
do that tommy if he wasnt cocksure
he can cross ahead of us when we come
together

  yes and weve got to sail this boat
for all there is in her or he will cross
us said tommy the alphas a devil
at windward work

iv

o	ailing opposite tacks the boats
gradually drew apart and which
was footing the faster or which pointing
the higher it was impossible to judge
the steady strong wind favored the
comet for she was notoriously a heavy-
weather boat tommy made a long
tack watching the throat of his sail
hugging the wind stealing every inch
he could for the boat that points the
closest to the wind may beat one that
outsails her in mere speed

  shes doing nobly said dicky
dont see how the alpha can beat this
much

  well well soon find out said
tommy hard alee

  around they came the crew scram-
bling over the trunk swinging the bags
from port to starboard and themselves
climbing out on top a moment later
the alpha came about also and the
boats began to draw together and as
they approached it became evident that
the comet was still in the lead as near
as they could tell in fact the alpha had
no succeeded in picking up an inch
and the comet slipped across her bows
with a good hundred yards to spare
and went on her way rejoicing

  dickys elation was beautiful to see
and the whole crew openly gloried in
ackers discomfiture but the end was
not yet each boat held her course
and again they dtew apart the comet
on the starboard tack the alpha on the
port

  perhaps tommy grew a little less
on the starboard tack



vigilant perhaps ackers worked a lit-
tle harder at any rate when next they
came about and drew together the al-
pha had cut into the comets lead most
woefully the latter now had the port
tack and for a time it looked as if she
would be forced to go about but a
fierce little puff of wind savedjier for
while it beat the alpha down till ack-
ers had to swing her up into the wind
thus checking her a bit the stiffer more
weatherly comet took it gallantly and
nosed across her oppqnents bows so
close that the proverbial biscuit might
have passed between them

  tommy had the sand bags shifted aft
a bit thinking the boat a little down by
the head they were within sight of
the clubhouse now and one more tack
would take them over the line

  for ten minutes more the boats held
their present courses when tommy
went about and headed for the line
ackers followed instantly and the
boats began to converge for the point
where their courses crossed was not
fifty yards from the finish

  it was a glorious struggle they
could see the pier and the clubhouse
veranda packed with people watching
the two crews were hanging over the
weather gunwales till they could see the
boats centerboards as they heeled to the
fierce rush of the wind down they
camc in the heartbreaking finish and
dicky peering under the comets
boom measured -their distance with
nervous interest

  i dont think hell make it he said

  hes gained though said tommy
itll be close

  now the conditions were these the
alpha on the port tack would be able
on her present course to cross the line
at its outer extremity while the comet
likewise would be able to cross but
close inshore the comet had the
right of way being on the starboard
tack and ackers only hope of winning
was to cross her bows if he suc-

ceeded in doing this he would have her
under his lee blanketed and the race
was his on the other hand if he ran
too close and then discovered that he
could not cross ahead of her he would
be compelled to go about to avoid col-
lision and would be himself under the
comets lee

  in any event the burden of decision
rested with ackers for tommy having
the right of way had but to sail a
straight course again dicky took a
look

  yes hes gained he said but
he cant pass us hell have to go
about

v

the boats were right upon one an-
other and suddenly ackers plan
was clear he would throw the burden
of deciding upon tommy after all he
lacked room to pass and he knew it
one hope of winning he still had it
was a slim chance but he took it by
holding his present course he could
force tommy to give way to avoid
smashing up the comet in a collision
tommy of course would protest but
the protest might be overruled and
even if it wasnt ackers at least would
have the honor of crossing the line first
before the crowd on the pier so he
calmly held his course straight for the
line and tommy was face to face with
a problem demanding instant solution

  he glanced beneath the boom at the
opposing boat shot another look at the
finish mark and leaning out hailed the
alpha better go about he cried

  no thanks answered ackers
i think theres room to pass

  thats a bluff growled dicky
tommy settled back and gripped the
tiller if that cad thought he could
force him off his course when he had
the right of way hed show him he
hated a row but there were some things
a fellow really couldnt stand you
know so he fixed his eyes on the ap-


top-notch magazine

proaching line and scowling nosed the
comet up into the very eye of the wind
which had the effect of reducing still
further ackers narrow margin

  then the boats were upon one an-
other and ackers saw his bluff about
to be called i say he shouted
dont run us dwn

  my right of way answered
tommy coolly and did not move his
tiller the fraction of an inch

   it was probably too late had he tried
 an instant after the comets forestay
 caught the alphas boom shoved it in-
 board and her bow crashed into her
 opponents quarter with the sound of
 rending wood

  then the comets forward over-
hang slid up on the alphas deck
smashed through the coaming of the
cockpit and as she lurched with the
weight slipped back and boring
straight ahead she shaved past her vic-
tims stern pushing the boom out as
she went and drove on toward the
finish	x

  it was all over in a moment and
almost before the people on the pier
could grasp what had happened the
comet with a badly strained forestay
and a splintered nose had slipped over
the line and the gun from the commit-
tee boat announced that the race was
won

   tommy let his halyards go by the run
 to take the strain off the damaged stay
 and a launch picked them up and towed
 them in just as the outraged alpha
 breathing anathema and slaughter stag-
 gered over the line a bad second

   on the pier the commodore turned
to the vice commodore served him
dead right you know he said in a
puzzled tone but tommy langhams
the last man on earth id have thought
would do it

   miss daisy arnold happened to stand
 where she overheard and for sortie rea-
 son she smiled-a little satisfied smile
 -and started down the pier to greet

tommy she was the first person he
saw as he stepped ashore and leaving
dicky to care for the comet he went
up to the clubhouse with her

  tell me about it she cried ex-
citedly

  well we had the right of way you
know- he began

  oh i know tommy she broke in
i watched it all i was so afraid you
wouldnt do it and if you hadnt id
never have forgiven you lets go sail-
ing to-night i-im not sure but i
have something to tell you tommy

  say it now cried tommy

  no she said there are too many
people around and its just for you
alone

 nerve tonic not required
the doctor had written a prescrip-
tion for his patient you had bet-
ter have this made up at the drug-
gists he said it will probably cost
you a dollar

  a dollar the patient exclaimed
all right ill get it made up then
as he turned to leave the office he
added i say could you lend me a
dollar to pay it with

  the doctor gasped he recovered in
a second however and asked for the
prescription the patient handed it
back and after the doctor had scratched
out one item in it he returned it again
together with a quarter

  you can get what is left made up
for twenty-five cents he remarked
dryly what i scratched out was for
your nerves

 patronizing art editor you
 ought to get five but as you
 are new to the business ill
 save the magazine the difference

  of course assented the artist ami-
ably ill stick you later when youre
obliged to have my work

  thats business agreed the art edi-
tor understand these covers are
business top none of your artistic
foolishness we want something thats
conventional in a new way get that
create a type-the jenkins girl every
department store must have pictures of
the jenkins girl pictures framed in
burned wood embroidered on sofa
cushions and stamped on leather that
is art

  nice prospect art said jenkins
they all kick up a bit at first the
art editor agreed soothingly but they
dont mind after a little it has its com-
pensations you know if you are care-
ful you can marry rich move in the

best circles join the most exclusive

will not cease to work hard for you
will always be afraid that your wife

  the editor enjoyed his own conversa-
tion and he had besides little to do
observing premonitory symptoms of
departure he offered jenkins a cigar
the artist twirled it in his fingers ab-
stractedly

ideas of fashionable marriage he said
besides when ive put by enough
money im gping to discontinue this
desecration of art and take up portrait

  oh i havent reached the point
where i cant see the difference between
a quarter and a half dollar just satisfy
my curiosity upon one point and the ar-
tistic conscience will have kicked its last
why in doing the altogether for a mag-
azine cover-say a spring piece or the
spirit of the woods or some such
original fantasy-why i say should the
unadorned figure be plump and solid
whereas if clothed she must be made
svelte diaphanous and slinky  i have
studied anatomy you know and i have
always in mind the figure as well as the
clothes in which it is sheathed

  your talk is piffle said the art edi-
tor but im sorry you have studied
anatomy it restrains invention if
you will look over our leading illus-
trators you will note that none of them
have any knowledge of anatomy your
reference to clothes is however im-
portant you must realize of course
how vital it is that you be not only up
to date but a little ahead of the styles
it is well to walk the avenue a bit but
the best wray of all is to study the latest
imported shows you will find that our
leading actresses have a great function
in the dissemination of new styles

  i heed your words of wisdom any
particular one you recommend

  lipski tells me that the costumes for
his prima donna cost him fifteen thou-
sand better strike him for a pass
just mention me

  and who is the prima donna asked
the artist

  the delightful french comedienne
yvette crevecceur no less fresh from
iowa via paris

  im from iowa myself said jen-
kins ill drop in and see her iowa
may thus furnish an easter design for

 ipski manager of the prancing
princess show pink blase and
with the stripes running up and down

granted jenkins a pass with scarcely
an evidence of life

  great little chorus he piped wear-
ily through rolls of fat

  the hussar girlies of the prancing
princess gamboled frivolously clad in
cobweb hosiery and the minimum of
supplementary garments the comedian
gesticulated his silent encore and
yvette crevecceur the prancing prin-
cess herself attired successively in a
riding habit a bathing suit a street
dress an evening gown and coronation
robes sang songs variously inconse-
quential

  jenkins was bored to death and
looked about for a means of escape
over or under the five large ladies be
tween him and the aisle thereupon
the princess danced down stage and
sang the chorus of her song directly
at him

  great cedar rapids  said he under
his breath it was the auburn hair
that fooled me

  he called an usher to carry his card
to the prima donna who presently re-
ceived him in her dressing room she
was having her hair revamped and the
maid hovered over her with deft fin-
gers but she extended a hand and
smiled at him from beneath the curling
iron

  its your own hair too he said
aggrieved and such a color no won-
der i didnt recognize you

  art demands its sacrifices she an-
swered lightly but he thought that she
was a bit hurt

  why didnt you tell me molse that
you were in this  he reproached her
i supposed you were still in paris

  hows the art will she evaded
you must be prosperous if you can
afford front-row seats for such a silly
show

  oh i got in on a pass-lipski

 i was afraid you were making
money she said relieved

  and why shouldnt i do that
that sort of thing



  it would spoil your work of
 course she answered

   you think so  he asked and looked
 at her quizzically and you in this
 show 

   i wasnt going to let you know of
 this until later she replied then i
 saw you were about to leave and i
 couldnt resist throwing myself at you
 i get so lonesome sometimes and long
 so to see a friend thats why i sig-
 naled you it was no especial com-
 pliment you see

  the maid dusted her with talcum
 powder jenkins out of habit let his
 eyes wander over the objects of the
 room-the trunks the forms with the
 costly dresses hung upon them the bare
 walls and floor the gas jet in which
 the maid heated the curling iron and
 finally back to the dressing table with
 its accessories of silver and cut glass
 each a sculptors tool for the modeling
 of beauty

   why are you doing it mollie for
 the money he asked

  she shot a quick apprehensive
 glance at him but he was abstract-
 edly noting the details of a dress

   oh its the easiest way to the legiti-
 mate she said carelessly then too
 it gives me training of a sort and
 best of all it gives me money which
 will be of use i make lots of money
 she added and tentatively more than
 i know what to do with

   the suggestion was lost upon him
 i thought shakespeare and ibsen were
 the only boys for you he said

   theyll keep she answered gayly
 a little more rouge marie now you
 may go

   jenkins shook his head frowning
 you and i were to put cedar rapids
 on the map remember he said wist-
 fully you the great actress i the
 great portrait painter now look at
 us

   she stole a troubled glance at him
 you will be the painter im confident

of that wliether im the actress or just
a prancing princess

  you think so he demanded again
sharply

  one of us must make good of
course she replied its for the glory
of cedar rapids and for each othef
ill feel i have a share in your suc-
cess and that is why i want you to

let me-

  suppose i should go in for the com-
mercial art myself he interposed un-
heeding her words

  but you wont she said and laid
her hand upon his i have faith in
you will more than in myself

  the young man covered her hand in
his and then let it drop i might do
it just the same he said dont be
too sure

  im not afraid she answered smil-
ing but she studied him narrowly nev-
ertheless he was not looking at her

  do you remember what we gave up
for this life of art he asked

  yes-no-i guess so she answered
uneasily for she saw there was no
stopping him she nervously snapped
the cover of a jewel box slyly she
abstracted a pink slip of paper with a
serrated edge she unfolded it read
it folded it again and held it concealed
in the palm of her hand she snapped
the cover of the box again and set it
upon the dressing table then she
awakened to him he was soliloquiz-
ing

  i might create a type-the jenkins
girl jenkins girl walking down fifth
avenue jenkins girl at the altar jen-
kins girl pouring tea jenkins girl with
arms about the neck of jenkins young
man these works of art would ap-
pear on magazine covers and sofa pil-
lows the bedroom of every sweet slif
of a sixteen-year-old girl would con-
tain one

no not that she said confidently
and we gave up for this he went
on undeterred the art of iowa i


top-notch

magazine

might be painting cornfields and pump-
kins for exhibition at the state and
county fairs and perhaps the repre-
sentative from my district would insist
upon the purchase by the state of one
of my masterpieces to hang in the cap-
itol building you wouli give dramatic
readings at the church socials and all
the good people would shake their heads
uneasily but never fail to come and
applaud

  i should give scenes from shake-
speare she said smiling but i fear
they would never stand for ibsen

  and we would have a pretty place
with a large garden and trees and big
verandas and we should have children
to bring up perhaps i think of them
sometimes when im blue

  dont will she said and laid her
hand over her eyes

  im talking this way to work on your
feelings he laughed uncertainly
mollie he said i want you now
more than then i can make a living
for us both at my work and though
it may not be portrait painting id
rather do it with you than be rem-
brandt without you i mean it its
not a matter of sudden impulse but
deliberate maybe the better work
would come later and if not no mat-
ter

  its good of you she said and
turned to him that he might see the
tears in her eyes but weve given up
too many years now to go back we
must keep on dont you see we could
never forgive ourselves for the wasted
years  besides she added noting
that he was unconvinced i cant give
up this life now it has grown upon
me i must have the nptoriety and the
lights and the music and all the things
cedar rapids could never give me its
true she said in answer to his pained
look and most of all ive set my
heart on your success i could never
forgive myself if i should keep you

from becoming all you should and will
become

iii

cor a brief moment there was silence
while their early dream endured
the light of a new aspiration then
on a quick impulse she came to him
and kneeling beside him put her arms
about him

  i want you to promise me some-
thing she commanded gently prom-
ise

  id do most anything for you mol-
lie he said

  it is this i wish you to take some
of my money for the years in paris
dont draw away promise me you will
the money comes so easily means so
little to me and you would do so
much with it i should feel that all
your success was mine too and that
would make me glad you would not
begrudge me that happiness will you
care enough for me not to mind my
having a part

  he endeavored gently to release him-
self promise to take the money she
insisted and placing her hands on
either cheek she forced him to look
at her you wont  she asked you
wont do that for me

  i couldnt do it mollie i love you
for it but i couldnt besides theres
no necessity

  why cant you she insisted

  i shouldnt feel right doing it he
answered ill get along all right i
can earn enough to make my way and
the credit will be yours just as truly
as though you sent me a weekly allow-
ance im afraid i couldnt take your
money unless you let me marry you
then of course it would be all right
many of our best citizens live on their
wives money

  i couldnt go so far as that she
said trying to laugh at his irony

  will you do something for me
that sort of thing



he asked something better for you
perhaps than to marry me

  why should i she flashed when
you will do nothing for me

  it is that you give up this sort of
thing he nodded his head to indi-
cate the surroundings as a whole go
into the legitimate mollie save your
money for the hard times youll find
there remember ive my ideal of you
and i dont like to see you in this
so give it up for my sake

  mollie stood apart from him and
her lips trembled though she seemed
to laugh through her tears would
you have me do all that for your sake 
she asked in a queer voice

  if it isnt too much to ask he an-
swered humbly

  she choked and replied between a
laugh and a sob then ill do it-for
your sake you see yours will be the
credit when im playing lady macbeth
to stupendous audiences

  and yours he said gravely when
i paint the portraits of oui leading
citizens do you think well find com-
pensation in the doing mollie

  we mustnt ever think of that
again she said firmly now go
write to me sometimes

  when he had kissed her good-by and
gone away she dropped her head amid
the toilet silver and cried quietly lipski
found her thus when he came to dis-
cover the cause for the delay of the
final act

  its a nervous breakdown she said
and dried her eyes calmly i must quit
i cant stand it any longer

  but the dresses he cried in con-
sternation

  you can have them refitted for miss
dutton she answered indifferently
and tore to bits the pink slip of paper
somewhat blistered with tears

  eighteen thousand a week contract
salary trouble for me all nothing
said lipski and spread his hands hope-
lessly only a fool would be in the

theatrical business and have dealing
with these actresses when can you
take your part again

  when i recover said she i shall
go into the legitimate as an understudy
to mrs clarke in shakespearian roles
then why did you give me all this
trouble and expense if you had such
crazy notions as that why didnt you
try to act shakespeare before if you
think you can

  i thought i needed the money she
said and now i find i dont

  you are crazy girl said lipski
with utter conviction

  the art editor had much the same
opinion to express of jenkins

sea color

the majority of writers speak of the
deep blue sea but the sea is not
always blue by any means there are
any number of colors to be observed

  the mediterranean however is true
blue because very few large fresh-
water rivers enter it and being prac-
tically landlocked and exposed to pow-
erful sunlight it has the greatest evapo-
ration of all seas

  some time ago the sea off the cali-
fornian coast turned almost black and
fishing came to an end but no cause
could be assigned for the phenomenon
the dull-reddish tint of the red sea
which has given it its name is due to
millions upon millions of miscroscopic
algae or seaweeds and submarine plants
the yellow sea of china owes its color
to the floods of muddy water which the
rivers pour into it

  generally speaking the blueness of
the sea water is in constant ratio to its
saltness in the tropics the tremendous
evaporation induced by the blazing sun
causes the water to be much saltier than
it is in the more northern latitudes for
about thirty degrees both north and
south of the equator the waters are of
an exquisite azure
chapter i
a moments darkness

hrough the windowless
shadow-hung gallery mr
rodney kendrick connois-
seur and collector moved
quietly and with assurance as
one perfectly familiar with his sur-
roundings he hummed softly to him-
self the faint barely perceptible glow
of the early twilight filtered down from
the big skylight overhead to no ad-
vantage save to mark the confines of
the leaded panes

  halfway across the gallery floor he
paused turned and retraced his steps
beside the door on the tapestried wall
his fingers found the push buttons that
controlled the lights in the high trough-
like borders he snapped them in rapid
succession then his humming ceased

  confound those lights he broke
out whats happened to them now
this is the second time to-day theyve

misbehaved if they fail to-night-

he stopped the mere thought of that
possibility was too disturbing to con-
template

he opened the door leading out into
the wide corridor prepared to demand
an explanation from the butler but un-
fortunately since dudley was not in
sight and several other people were
mr kendrick wisely restrained himself
and closed the door again he would
reserve his remarks for some later
time nevertheless dudley must an-
swer for the inexcusable annoyance it
must not happen again what good
were lights anyway he reasoned irri-
tably if they refused to operate when
they were needed

   still grumbling he walked across the
floor the heavy rugs smothering his
footsteps avoided the divan and the
chairs that had been arranged in a
wide semicircle facing one end of the
gallery and paused before a velvet cur-
tain that served to screen a portion of
the wall

   standing there his mood changed
the affair of the lights was forgotten
the scowl that clouded his features
magically disappeared he broke into
a low chuckle then as cautiously and
expectantly as a child might steal a
-glimpse of a thing denied it mr ken-
the bashful crocodile



drick reached out touched the folds of
the velvet curtains and parted them

  the massive gold frame was barely
discernible the painting it held was
blurred in the gloom but mr ken-
drick peering eagerly knew what the
frame inclosed and the very knowledge
of it sent his pulses racing to-night
he murmured rapturously the others
shall see it

  for a long time he remained there
a stooped and shadow-muffled figure in
the silent gallery then he allowed
the curtain to slip from his fingers and
reluctantly turned away suddenly as
he reached the door the tardy lights
came on and the walls of the gallery
sprang into view as swiftly and miracu-
lously as a colored picture flashed upon
a screen

  mr kendrick blinked started back
and whirled expectantly as if to find
an intnader at his elbow then find-
ing no one the situation explained it-
self the current had failed to act
at his first bidding but the connection
had been made and left and now with
the coming of the belated power the
lights blazed out confound it he
exclaimed for the second time recover-
ing from his bewilderment what
does this fool tampering mean  it
must stop at once dudley must ex-
plain

  his restless eyes swept the lofty gal-
lery even as he spoke lingering with
pardonable pride upon this canvas and
that upon the hanging tapestries the
marble and bronze figures and upon
the squat medieval lamp that burned
dully on its stone pedestal the warm
red of the heavy rugs the soft gray
of the walls the cunningly hidden bor-
der strips that trapped and diffused the
lights were all a part of the comfort-
ing pictufe mr kendricks eyes came
to rest at last upon the guardian velvet
curtain at the far end of the room

the stage was set-his stage the
spectators were soon to gather-the

spectators he had chosen so carefully
and when the curtains should open
-mr kendrick heaved a deep sigh of
pleasurable anticipation one by one
he pressed the buttons and one by one
the walls were plunged into gloom he
opened the door and closed it softly
behind him making sure that it was
locked before he walked away

  as mr kendrick moved down the
corridor in the direction of the living
room the butler crossed his path in-
stantly the master of the house recalled
a most important matter

  dudley he called has any one
been tampering with the electric
switches this afternoon the lights in
the gallery are acting-er-freakishly
the lights sir repeated dudley
i did not know they were out of
order

  you must look into the matter dud-
ley have them inspected at once

  i shall telephone the power com-
pany immediately said the butler

  i dont want anything to interfere
with to-nights program dudley you
are my stage manager it is most im-
portant that things shall run smoothly
you understand of course most im-
portant he hesitated a moment
while a significant glance passed be-
tween master and servant have all
the guests arrived

  dudley nodded yes sir the last
ones came an hour ago mr and mrs

rankin mr mcgrath-

  and mr talbot the collector in-
quired anxiously

 mr talbot arrived while you were
on the links

  mr kendrick made evident his re-
lief very well dudley see that din-
ner is served promptly to-night-there
must be no delay you understand
i expect a great deal from you to-
night dudley you must not fail me
and dudley he went on in a lower
tone see that mr talbot is made very
comfortable he is a most desirable


top-notch magazine

guest-represents a clique of wealthy
english collectors i am highly com-
plimented that he saw fit to accept my
invitation i shall be most interested
in meeting him

  just a minute mr kendrick dud-
ley spoke up as his employer started
away did you see mr ward this aft-
ernoon he was asking to speak with
you

  oh in regard to the canvas he
brought i suppose

  i believe so sir

  you may tell him that i shall ex-
amine the painting later on if he
cares to he may leave the canvas in
my room

  yes sir

  and dudley mr kendrick con-
tinued you have obeyed my instruc-
tions none of the guests has entered
the gallery to-day

  i have taken good care f that
dudley responded

  very good very good i dont
wish my little surprise to be antici-
pated wte must be very careful-in
more ways than one dudley

 you may depend upon me mr
kendrick

chapter ii

the honored guest

th hands clasped behind him the
master of the house walked down
the corridor and ascended the broad
flight of stairs that led to the upper
hall reaching there he went directly
to one of the doors and tapped lightly
upon it a girlish voice bade him enter

  dont let me interfere paula he
said as he stepped into his daughters
cozy sitting room i just wanted you
to know that all the guests have ar-
rived so dudley tells me i had to
leave them a moment to look after th
lights i missed welcoming mr tal-
bot but i will convey my apologies to
him later in the evening there have
been so many details to arrange din-

ner is to be rather early and i want
you to be down at least fifteen minutes
before it is served

  i wont be late if i can help it
the girl replied but miss halsey and
mr ward have been with me all aft-
ernoon ive elected myself a guide
im making personally conducted tours
for the edification of our guests we
visited everywhere except the gallery-
and dudley wouldnt let us in

  were all to visit the gallery after
dinner mr kendrick said i didnt
want to spoil my surprise i hope you

havent given so much as a hint to-

  of course not but at the time i
had forgotten all about it do you
know father the girl went on i
never saw a man so appreciative as mr
ward im quite sure he has exhausted
his stock of superlatives why he went
into ecstasy over those chin lung
vases

  did he well theyre worth it
he wont find another pair like them
in this country

  i told mr ward you had half prom-
ised them to me but that i was afraid
they would go as-as the other things
have gone you know how unreason-
able you are father just when i be-
gin to admire a vase or a bit of tapes-
try or a painting-it suddenly disap-
pears and youll never explain why
there was that lovely little prayer

  you didnt mention that to mr
ward did you paula the father took
up sharply

  why not he was very much in-
terested i described it as well as i
could mr ward said it must have
been worth five thousand dollars of
course it wasnt but i didnt try to
dispute him you told me it wasnt
worth more than five hundred

  mr kendricks face underwent a
sudden and decided change but the girl
did not witness it i wish you wouldnt
take every one into your confidence
the bashful crocodile



paula he remonstrated ive told
you that so many times before why
will you persist in doing exactly what
i asked you not to do

 oh but surely-mr ward-you
dont mind my telling him

  i didnt want it to become known
that the rug was here-or had been
here he maintained of course you
didnt understand but youll be more
thoughtful in the future wont you 
the girl put her arms about her
fathers neck oh im sorry-really
sorry she faltered i didnt think i
was doing anything so dreadfully
wrong

  it wasnt wrong paula and it wasnt
dreadful mr kendrick said hurriedly
at the sight of his daughters crest-
fallen face i-im just a little jeal-
ous of my prizes thats all he added
by the way of explanation

  sometimes i believe you are fonder
of them than you are of me the girl
declared smiling again and some-
times i think just the opposite youre
forever buying and forever selling i
cant quite make you out father

  its just a matter of business
paula he answered we must live
you know and if i didnt make
money where would all your pretty
clothes come from

  all my pretty clothes havent
amounted to much in the past paula
said quickly this is the first house
party you have allowed me to give-
and it is your party after all instead
of mine you invited most of the
guests you never wanted any of my
friends here-what few i have you
seemed to fear them you seemed to
think they were coming here only to
pilfer you were ready and eager that
i should go out and enjoy myself-
away from home but you protested
when i wished to return my obligations
to-night is the first time we have en-
tertained in our home why i have
tried to answer that question others

have tried too why wont you an-
swer it father

  behind a smiling and placid coun-
tenance mr kendrick winced the
arraignment hurt because he had no de-
fense to offer still he did not per-
mit his feelings to betray themselves
he had fought them down for so long
that it was not hard to retain the mask
that concealed them

  im downright jealous all the way
through he declared that explains
it paula im jealous and selfish you
mustnt blame me youre my greatest
treasure dear i often wonder how
long you are to be with me he went
on tenderly im living in fear of
that moment one of these days some-
body will come along and-and rob
me then ill be miserable

  youre not miserable when your
other treasures go the girl contended
you pretend to be but i feel some-
times deep down in my heart that
youre shamming

  mr kendrick made a determined ef-
fort to change the subject of discus-
sion let us forget what has passed
dear he said to-night begins a
new life for us both were not going
to be hermits any longer were going
to rub shoulders with the world and
find happiness on every side run
along now and finish dressing ill ex-
pect you to be downstairs promptly
why i never heard you talk that
way before father paula cried her
eyes radiant do you really mean-
all that

  every word of it dear he re-
sponded and more were going to
live differently from now on

  with an eager impulsive kiss and a
laugh the girl took leave of her father
at the door when he had closed it
softly behind him he walked thought-
fully down the hall toward his own
apartment

  later finished with her toilet paula
slipped from her room and hurried


top-notch magazine

down the stairs totally unconscious of
the fact that she was observed she
presented so simple and charming a pic-
ture as she paused an instant on the
lower landing to smooth out a ruffle on
her sleeve that one of the guests who
beheld the vision from a comfortable
chair in the smoking room-the door of
which was partly open-stifled an ex-
clamation laid aside his cigar and ad-
vanced to meet her

  good evening miss kendrick he
said extending his hand he had only
spoken a word to her at the time of his
arrival-a cold and formal self-intro-
duction but she had been in his
thoughts ever since

  paula a trifle confused looked into
the mans frank level eyes and smiled
she tried desperately to recall his name
but for the moment it eluded her she
remembered the introduction but could
not connect the name with it be-
sides the change from tweeds to even-
ing dress had made a remarkable
change in his appearance she found
herself facing a tall comely young man
apparently in his early thirties whose
regular clean-cut features and man-
ners showed breeding and refinement
paula was a girl whose likes and dis-
likes were born of first impressions so
even as the man advanced toward her
and spoke and held out his hand she
was interested she decided at the in-
stant his fingers touched her own that
she was going to like him

  i seem to be the first to come down-
stairs he observed

  as they talked paula found her com-
panion more and more agreeable there
was a spirit of good-fellowship in his
words she was certain that they would
get along splendidly together if she
could only recall his name a little
panic of fear gripped her as she con-
jured up the dread possibility of a third
persons appearing upon the scene an
introduction wa out of the question

  in hopes that by some chance remark

the guest would betray himself or that
his name would come to her as swiftly
as it had deserted her paula continued
the conversation have you been talk-
ing with father this afternoon she
inquired launching herself bravely into
the first subject that crossed her mind
has he entertained you with his dis-
courses upon the-the influence of pre-
raphaelitism on modem art or some
other horribly dry topic 

  i havent had that pleasure yet he
responded but i am sure mr ken-
dricks discussions would not prove irk-
some i am looking forward to a very
pleasant chat

  i cannot imagine how you have es-
caped father tries desperately hard to
interest me in his arguments but im
afraid i am a very dull and unappre-
ciative companion

  impossible the other replied
the fact is miss kendrick he went
on to explain i have not yet had the
honor of meeting your father

  not met him paula exclaimed

then how-

  oh pardon me i was under the
impression that mr kendrick explained
the situation he smiled into the girls
perturbed face you see i received
your fathers letter upon my arrival
friday at the new york hotel my
prospective appearance in this country
was heralded by the newspapers and
knowing of my kindred interests he
thoughtfully asked me to make up one
of his house party your father i
may add miss kendrick is known as
one of the most distinguished connois-
seurs and collectors in this part of the
world i consider it an honor indeed
to be numbered among the few who are
privileged to meet him personally and
to admire his art treasures

  in a flash the speakers name flashed
into the girls mind her father had
mentioned it several times before and
appeared to be delighted that the critic
had accepted his invitation it is very
the bashful crocodile



good of you to say that mr talbot
paula answered and now that the
dreaded gulf had been spanned she
breathed easier for the moment i
was puzzled father has spoken of
you so often he was afraid at first
that you might be too busy to visit us
too busy talbot said reproach-
fully i would have broken every
other engagement to come here his
voice was low and serious you do
not realize what it means to me miss
kendrick

  i hope your expectations will be
fulfilled she replied

  i know they will talbot was smil-
ing again it has hardly been fair
he went on for mr kendrick to keep
so wonderful a treasure house and so
charming a hostess all to himself
paulas cheeks colored father is
jealous she said falling back upon
the only defense she knew i suppose
that explains it arent all men of his
profession the same mr talbot
not all of them talbot returned
with a quick and curious tightening of
his lips if they were miss ken-
drick the most beautiful things in the
world would be locked away

  tve often given father the same
argument she said

  you have talbot seemed to be
interested and what did he say
how did he defend himself

  he pleaded guilty to selfishness and
jealousy

  but he isnt selfish and jealous in
any other way is he your father
always gives you what you want
oh always paula hastened to as-
sure him he gives me everything
in matters concerning my material well-
being he is a spendthrift

chapter iii

     the genuine landscape
talbot eyed the girl frankly and
was silent paula feeling herself
the object of so open and critical a

scrutiny looked away and when a
moment later ward appeared upon the
lower landing and came forward at her
beckoning she welcomed the interrup-
tion oh mr ward she broke out
i want you to meet mr talbot of
course you know who he is

  ward a younger man than talbot
with steady gray eyes and a boyish
face came forward to meet the critic
im glad to make your acquaintance
he said as their hands met i have
always said that there were two men
in the art world whom i would be in-
terested in meeting one of them is
mr kendrick the other is yourself
talbot seemed to be genuinely em-
barrassed to have my name stand
with mr kendricks is an honor indeed
im afraid you have exaggerated my
very ordinary abilities

  exaggerated not at all ward
took up swiftly as a critic you are
known from rotten row to bombay
and as a keen follower of blind trails-
well ive heard the story of the lost
titian mr talbot for a long time
we did not know who was responsible
for the restoration of the stolen paint-
ing to the british museum then quite
by accident the truth came out he
turned toward the girl as if to offer an
explanation of course you have
heard of it miss kendrick mr tal-
bot trailed the thief over half of europe
and nabbed him with the stolen master-
piece in his possession in ceylon it
was a remarkable and skillful bit of
work an adventure surpassing any of
sherlock holmes my congratulations
may be tardy but i extend them just
the same you should not hide your
light under a bushel mr talbot

  i only did what was expected of
me talbot replied modestly the
authorities placed the matter in my
hands and asked me to do the best i
knew how i did but i assure you
there was nothing thrilling or remark-
able in the pursuit the thief left a
	top-notch

                                                           

trail behind him that any amateur could
follow and it was merely a case of
keeping on the go until one or the other
of us gave up fortunately for me he
ran out of money and out of breath
to hear you tell it returned ward
one would think you had been out for
a holiday jaunt

  so it was said talbot recrea-
tion and business combined i not only
collared the thief but stumbled across
several interesting canvases as well
fools luck he added laughing

  ill leave you gentlemen to continue
your talk put in paula while i look
after my other guests

  dont be too long ward cautioned
we may need you as a peacemaker
chimed in talbot smiling

  the men looked after the girl as she
disappeared at the end of the corridor
then turned reluctantly into the smok-
ing room they settled themselves
comfortably in the deep leather chairs
before the open fireplace a charming
girl announced talbot after a long
period of reflective silence

  very returned ward

  i wonder what lucky man will-

talbot broke off abruptly and stared
into the fire

  ward turned in his chair and re-
garded the speaker fixedly then he
frowned as a quick unwelcome suspi-
cion entered his mind talbot appeared
to be oblivious to his surroundings and
to the searching gaze the other focused
upon him and as he sat there star-
ing blankly into the flames his fingers
drumming softly upon the arm of his
chair a slow smile touched his lips-a
smile that ward tried in vain to in-
terpret

  the bargaining for canvases seems
to be a mighty futile pursuit after all
talbot began once more when one
compares it to other objects in life
yes agreed ward still watching
him

  once more the two men were silent

magazine

the fire crackled and snapped and sent
up tiny showers of sparks dudley
noiselessly appeared at the door and
being unobserved and apparently un-
wanted as noiselessly disappeared

  what do you think of mr ken-
dricks gallery ward broke in at
last

  i havent had the pleasure of visit-
ing it yet talbot replied i am look-
ing forward to that privilege

  you do not think that a man of
mr kendricks experience and knowl-
edge could be tricked ward asked

  in what way talbot inquired sur-
prised at the question

  that he might purchase a copy in-
stead of the original and not detect the
fraud

  talbot shook his head not mr
kendrick he declared with assurance
why do you ask

  with a nod ward indicated a paint-
ing that hung above the mantel-a
mellowed composition of sun-dappled
woodland a wide sweep of amethyst
sky and a mirrorlike pool that reflected
both mr kendrick and i have had
many discussions over that canvas
he said

  discussions  in what way 

  it was bought for an original bel-
lini ward answered

  talbot arose deliberately from his
chair and inspected the canvas at close
range ward watched him expectantly
so you think that mr kendrick has
been deceived talbot asked complet-
ing his inspection

  some of the cleverest men in the
country are fooled occasionally ward
remarked

  i grant you that said talbot
they are fooled because they are
pitted against the shrewdest crooks of
the ae the manufacture of master-
pieces has reached unbelievable perfec-
tion in some instances i do not hesi-
tate to say the copies are superior in
many respects to the originals the
the bashful crocodile



artists themselves have been known to
be deceived

  then why do you believe mr ken-
drick to be an exception

  talbot dropped into his chair again
well in the first place he observed
bellinis work is not valuable enough
to tempt the copyists these geniuses
play for high stakes they cannot af-
ford to waste time and energy in the
manufacture of a canvas that will bring
but a few hundreds

  then you are convinced that the
canvas you inspected is a genuine bel-
lini ward asked

  there is absolutely no question
about it replied talbot nodding the
work is an original of bellinis

  ward settled back in his chair while
a flicker of perplexity crossed his coun-
tenance my opinion seems to be rid-
dled he said at last i was positive
that it was a copy but with you and

mr kendrick arrayed against me-

he broke off with an embarrassed
laugh i guess im not the expert i
considered myself to be

  you dont need to apologize tal-
bot answered by forming an opinion
and sticking to it you have made it
quite clear that you have character
thats something to be commended
ward smiled at the compliment the
critic had paid him but did not imme-
diately respond and presently the talk
drifted upon other subjects through
all the conversation that followed how-
ever ward appeared to be strangely
preoccupied and made his attitude so
obvious that more than once talbot
looked at him in polite astonishment

  later when the smoking room had
filled and talbot had strolled off with
mr kendrick ward slipped away in
search of paula he came upon her in
one of the reception rooms surrounded
by an interested group after a bit of
maneuvering he managed to draw her
to one side at the sight of his unusu-
ally perturbed face the girl broke into

an exclamation what has happened 
she cried was mr talbots com-
pany so dreadfully stupid

just the contrary ward said it
was intensely interesting you had
never met mr talbot before had you
no i met him for the first time
this afternoon

  and your father

  he met him for the first time this
evening said the girl

  then talbot was invited here by
letter asked the young man

  father learned of his arrival in
new york and sent an invitation to
his hotel the girl explained why
because ward responded quietly
but with a note of triumph in his voice
the man you introduced me to isnt
talbot the critic im sure of that

chapter iv

when the curtains parted

daula stared at the speaker in
amazement not the critic she
repeated why-why do you say
that

 remember when you introduced
him to me ward began well he
continued as the girl nodded when i
mentioned the affair of the stolen ti-
tian i made a slip the picture was
not recovered in ceylon but in cairo
i did not realize my mistake until after-
ward-and talbot did not correct me
thats what started me thinking later
i proved that my early suspicions were
correct

  i dont understand paula said
you know the painting over the
mantel in the smoking room

  you mean the corot paula said
ward nodded yes the corot the
guest you introduced me to who is
credited with being the greatest expert
in europe unhesitatingly pronounced it
a genuine bellini

  i-i cant believe it broke from
the astounded girl


top-notch magazine

  what object could i have in telling
you a falsehood ward said reproach-
fully

  oh i didnt mean that paula ex-
plained hurriedly i meant-that mr
talbot must have been joking

  ward shook his head far from it
he was serious

  the girl appeared to be more bewil-
dered than ever but if he is not the
mr talbot we expected who is he
why is he here why should he mis-
represent himself 

  i cannot answer any of those ques-
tions miss kendrick ward replied
slowly meditatively but i shall make
every effort to find out this house
party is something of an event he
went on and there are any number
of men who would assume a big risk
in order to attend

  then you believe this man is here
under false pretenses

  ward nodded i am positive of it
hadnt we better tell father paula
suggested

  i intend to later on ward an-
swered however i do not wish to
disturb mr kendrick until i have fully
verified my suspicions the discovery
will come soon enough this pretender
whoever he is will not be able to fool
your father suppose we wait until
after dinner ill watch this mr tal-
bot and find out something more defi-
nite before confronting him i think
that will be the better way

  paula clasped and unclasped her
hands nervously you do not think
if this man is an impostor that he
could possibly mean harm-to father
an all but perceptible change swept
across wards face what do you
mean he questioned swiftly how
could this man harm your father
oh i dont know she reasoned
but-but to have a stranger in the
house--in this house-with all of

fathers treasures- her voice

broke and she was silent

  ward continued to gaze searchingly
into the girls doubting eyes then he
spoke with grim confidence please
do not worry about that miss ken-
drick he said it isnt likely that this

man is a criminal and yet- a

shadow of doubt came over his face
but remember that whatever he may
e i am watching

  dudley appeared before them to an-
nounce that dinner was served ward
smilingly offered his arm to the girl
and led the way into the dining room
the big jacobean dining hall with its
softly gleaming lights its high-paneled
walls its brilliant hunting canvases and
its huge open fireplace in which a wood
fire crackled merrily formed an ad-
mirable setting for the guests-who as-
sembled at the table

  at the right of the host sat talbot
who was particularly uncommunicative
during the dinner and whose eyes con-
stantly strayed toward miss kendrick
paula for all her fears-they had not
been entirely dispelled by wards prom-
ises-chatted gayly and pretended to
be serenely unaware of the continued
observation occasionally she glanced
in wards direction and each time she
saw that his eyes were fastened stealth-
ily upon talbot

  next to ward sat mcgrath a stern
sharp-featured man who was known
among his associates as a shrewd ex-
pert in all matters pertaining to art
and a dependable agent who during an
adventurous and varied career had been
instrumental in the buying and selling
of uncounted old masters

  beyond the expert sat powell a sev-
eral-time millionaire who found or
pretended to find more keen enjoy-
ment in the collecting of canvases than
he did in the collecting of dollars and
as he had a sufficient accumulation of
the latter he did not find it an arduous
task to gratify his whim opposite to
him sat his wife a prim smallish old
the bashful crocodile



lady in black who had given him the
needed impetus toward both collections

  the others at the table were names
to conjure with in the realm of pic-
turedom critics and collectors artists
and connoisseurs dealers and agents
those who appreciated what they bar-
gained for and those who bought be-
cause they had nothing better to do
taking whatever pleasure they could in
the possession of a thing desired by an-
other

  although the trend of the conversa-
tion during the dinner traveled from
subject to subject on cues discreetly
dropped by the host himself the par-
ticipants did not enter whole-heartedly
into the spirit of their discussions
there seemed to be a decided and dis-
tracting undercurrent of expectancy
that grew more and more pronounced
as the meal progressed in spite of the
interesting and timely themes ad-
vanced the diners eagerly awaited the
something that seemed imminent each
knew as positively as if their invita-
tion had been so worded that mr ken-
drick had a surprise in store for them
that the comment and generalities were
but a prelude to the thing anticipated

  it was with the coming of the coffee
that mr talbot greatly to wards as-
tonishment mentioned viewing several
of murillos canvases on exhibition in
a london gallery it is to be re-
gretted talbot went on to add that
so many of that great artists pictures
have been lost there are at least forty
of them unaccounted for some un-
doubtedly have been destroyed some
lost some few are probably in the hands
of collectors who are not publishing the
fact

  wre have the french to blame for
that misfortune said mr kendrick
the french invaders of spain it
seems were connoisseurs as well as
soldiers

talbot nodded approvingly i re-
call to mind one canvas  particular

mentioned in the history of that in-
vasion he said it has been said to
surpass any other work the artist has
done it is one of the rare portraits
murillo executed after he attained rec-
ognition in his own country if this
canvas should be found undamaged
and in a fair state of preservation i
do not hesitate to say that it would cre-
ate a profound sensation in the art
world

  you refer of course to murillos
spanish lady said mcgrath

  talbot nodded  do once again
wards pulse quickened his lips tight-
ened he gave the appearance of one
wrestling with an abstruse mental prob-
lem still he did not speak but with
the others waited for talbot to go on
it is a canvas talbot resumed after
an interval of silence which the artist
himself prized above every other effort
doubtless because the subject was so
near and dear to him it was a por-
trait as we all know of murillos
daughter francisca

  its recovery has been frequently
rumored ward forced himself to say

  talbot nodded i have made sev-
eral wild-goose chases in quest of it
he declared warming up to the sub-
ject two years ago in italy i did
find a monk who claimed to have un-
earthed the canvas in a nunnery wthere
francisca died and parted with it for
an insignificant sum he described
it so minutely that i believe he told me
the truth after hearing his story i
tried to follow up what faint and un-
satisfactory clews he had to offer but
my efforts were futile i am almost
convinced that the painting has been
destroyed

  i imagine ventured powell who
had been a most attentive listener to
the story that the picture would be
worth a small fortune to-day

  i do not think fifty thousand dol-
lars would be an extravagant sum to
mention talbot answered readily


top-notch magazine

  thats too conservative chimed in
mcgrath why i know of a dozen
men right here in this country who
would pay a hundred thousand for it
and no questions asked if convinced
of its authenticity

  might as well put the offer at a
million ward spoke up im of mr
talbots opinion he gazed steadily
at the critic as he continued that
murillo is gone forever

  im afraid so talbot agreed

  if it is agreeable suggested mr
kendrick his eyes twinkling we will
continue this interesting discussion in
the gallery i have recently acquired
a painting that may invite criticism
in my opinion mr kendrick tal-
bot said rising with the others any
canvas that you have acquired is quite
beyond criticism

  thank you the host rejoined smil-
ing however this may prove the
exception may i be permitted to lead
the way

  the alert guests requiring no second
invitation passed out of the dining room
and down the corridor toward the gal-
lery without being informed in so
many words the visitors knew that it
was with this one object in view that
mr kendrick had brought them to-
gether the dinner had been merely
the overture before the play

  while the chattering guests seated
themselves in the gallery chairs to face
the velvet curtains and to speculate
eagerly upon the canvas to be disclosed
mr kendrick called his butler aside
and questioned him you communi-
cated with the power company dud-
ley he asked

  the very first thing was the whis-
pered answer they sent a man here
but he could find nothing wrong with
the lights they appeared to be in per-
fect condition i cant quite make it
out

  well if the lights are behaving
themselves now mr kendrick replied

we wont worry about what has passed
ill look into the matter later on you
remember the instructions i gave you
dudley

  perfectly sir

  very good with this mr ken-
drick relieved and smiling now that
his surprise was ready to break walked
briskly across the gallery floor took
up his position at one side of the cur-
tain and faced his expectant audience

  i am honored he began his words
echoing clearly in the hushed gallery
in being permitted to address so rep-
resentative and appreciative a gather-
ing i have in the past been rather
miserly with my treasures i realize
however and each of you will bear me
out i am sure that we are all more
or less afflicted by jealousy and selfish-
ness we derive qur greatest enjoy-
ment in possessing not in sharing but
i feel that the canvas i am to unveil
to-night is so magnificent so worthy
so incomparable that to keep it hidden
to keep it only to myself would be an
unpardonable offense

  he paused and nodded and dudley
stationed at the gallery door extin-
guished all the lights cxcept those fitted
in the border trough above the screened
painting

  to prepare you mr kendrick re-
sumed i will state that following
years of patient effort working quietly
and persistently i have at last been
rewarded in the discovery and the pos-
session of bartolome murillos finest
example of portraiture i think i may
safely use the word finest without
exaggeration there is something in
this canvas that is lacking in all others
every tint every brush stroke breathes
inspiration devotion an overpowering
and mastering love-because the sub-
ject was so near and dear to the crea-
tors heart

  portrait exclaimed mcgrath lean-
ing forward in his chair his twitching
face barely visible in the semidarkness
the bashful crocodile



a murillo there was a world of
concern in his tone

 yes mr kendrick answered
slowly-and his words were tremulous
in spite of his attempted control mu-
rillos portrait-of his daughter
mcgrath broke into a second excla-
mation more violent than the first
others in the room joined him the
spanish lady he cried sharply

  mr kendrick nodded and paused a
moment as if to allow the full signifi-
cance of his statement to be grasped
in ending he said after an interval
i wish to repeat the words mr tal-
bot used earlier in the evening-the
finding of this masterpiece undamaged
and in a fair state of preservation will
create a sensation in the art world 
his fingers tightened upon the cords
and the velvet curtain obeying the sum-
mons parted swiftly

chapter v

on what date

ai r kendricks eyes were fas-
tened not upon the canvas but
upon the peering incredulous faces of
his guests in the moment following
the disclosure of the painting not a
sound disturbed the hushed gallery the
occupants might have been taken for a
collection of rigid wax figures then
as the plaudits of an audience follow the
termination of an intense and gripping
scene a shout of approval went up in-
termingled with laughter and the patter
of hands

  disconcerted by this unexpected and
vociferous outburst mr kendrick
turned his glance fell upon the can-
vas the picture he beheld in the mas-
sive gold frame bathed in the glow
of the electrics transformed his coun-
tenance but the expression was lost
upon his audience since he stood back
in the shadows pretty clever some
one shouted above the laughter con-
gratulations mr kendrick

cha

  when did you become a futurist ad-
herent mr kendrick

  a silly joke growled mcgrath
passing a hand across his flushed face
yet smiling in spite of himself

  mr kendrick continued to stare at
the canvas he had unveiled it was a
vivid and grotesque example of futurist
fancy the ungainly figure of a green-
and-yellow crocodile emerging from a
shadowy rock-fringed pool stood out
with startling contrast against a vari-
colored background of palm trees its
dripping head was tipped shyly to one
side its cavernous mouth was partly
open its teeth gleamed wickedly yet
the big topaz eyes were downcast and
ridiculously demure upon the bank of
the pool an unsuspecting negro boy
dozed peacefully the expression of
the mighty animal with uplifted foot
its tilted head and its abashed eyes
seamed to convey too plainly the feel-
ings that must have assailed its tender
saurian heart had the creature been
gifted with speech it might have said
oh dear i do hope i havent star-
tled this trusting lad

  on the lower part of the canvas in
brilliantly conspicuous letters was the
title the bashful crocodile

  the whole composition was so ab-
surd so utterly ridiculous and nonsen-
sical so different from what the guests
had expected to see that it was small
wonder they greeted the caricature with
gales of merriment once the first shock
had passed

  in the rear doorway of the gallery
his face marble white his eyes bulging
stood dudley he gazed upon the paint-
ing as one might gaze upon an appa-
rition he was unobserved then ab-
ruptly his expression changed to one
of grim determination and purpose his
arm shot out toward the wall buttons
and the lights blazed forth

  with the coming of the lights that
brought the four walls of the gallery
into life the amused spectators trans-


top-notch magazine

ferred their attentions to their host mr
kendrick was bowing delightedly his
face wreathed in smiles to all appear-
ances the outcome of what they had
taken for his cleverly prepared surprise
had fulfilled his every expectation

  once the chairs had been pushed
back and the conversation resumed the
guests still chuckling over the un-
wonted surprise and the unsuspecting
manner in which the whole affair had
been staged moved about the gallery

  several of the men joined mr ken-
drick and gave the newly unveiled can-
vas a more deliberate inspection it
certainly will create a profound sensa-
tion in the art circles observed mc-
grath cocking a speculative eye upon
the painting look closely gentle-
men  he went on have you ever
seen a more perfect rendering of the
family crocodilia  murillo has excelled
himself  he has displayed a keen in-
sight a remarkable spirit of daring
what other master would have ven-
tured to select so humble and ugly a
subject daring is the only word for
it gentlemen

  there is no question of that pow-
ell agreed none at all it is amaz-
ing and look there in the foliage
just to the left of the mighty saurian
upon my soul it is a species of the
plover the boon companion of the croc-
odile-his alarm clock i might say
that isnt a plover mcgrath dis-
puted its a fern

  reminds me of the studies i used
to make in school chimed in another
observer had i been given the proper
encouragement in my youth i might
have rivaled murillo

  have you ever seen a more marvel-
ous and lifelike expression upon a croc-
odiles features asked powell a
more subtle rendering of modesty mu-
rillo has tried to show us that even
these ungainly denizens of the swamps
were possessed of feelings and what
charm there is in the reclining figure of

the drowsy blackamoor how suggest-
ive of the south and the background
gentlemen i ask you to observe it
closely those filmy blossoms of the

cotton shrubs-

  cotton shrubs scoffed mcgrath
interrupting the eulogy absurd
those are palm trees

  i leave it to you mr kendrick
powell said turning toward his host
are they cotton shrubs or palm trees
it isnt for me to say gentlemen
mr kendrick replied entering into the
spirit of the argument an observer
must be a judge unto himself the
truth is apparent only to those who can
appreciate the latent beauties of the
composition

  by jove exclaimed halsey who
had been standing before the canvas
and now joined in the discussion for
the first time i like the thing no
joking i do like it its so-so
blamed odd so different from any-
thing i have ever seen before

  its odd all right agreed mcgrath
after mrs halsey had taken her
husband in tow ward came down to
join the group of men he was smil-
ing but the smile had been assumed
only a moment before i wonder how
many of us recall the date he ex-
claimed isnt to-day the first of
april 

  good lord so it is  cried powell
never gave it a thought now we
have the explanation gentlemen mr
kendrick has certainly taken us in for
fair murillos long-lost canvas his
charming daughter oh my thats
rich and for a time i actually be-
lieved our host was telling us the truth 
you werent alone in your belief
supplemented mcgrath i was so
keyed up over the veiled canvas that i
havent yet recovered why i was all
ready to make a bid-and a mighty stiff
one at that

  im sorry ive disappointed you
mr kendrick said and there was a
the bashful crocodile	

perceptible change in his tone really
sorry

  talbot who had been inspecting the
other canvases on the gallery walls
overheard the last remark and strolled
down to join the group of men sur-
rounding the host if you had not dis-
appointed us mr kendrick he said
quietly i would have outbid any man
in the room

  mcgrath looked around his eyes
twinkling shrewdly were all laboring
under the impression that mr kendrick
would have consented to sell the can-
vas arent we another example of
counting our chickens before theyre
hatched

  there is a price for everything as
serted talbot slowly even for muril-
los spanish lady

  was the april-fool prank a surprise
to you mr talbot ward asked

  i was disappointed to say the least
the critic answered despite the fact
that i built up my expectations against
my better judgment

  i fear that in the attempt to mislead
my audience i exceeded my intentions
mr kendrick said perhaps i should
apologize

  no need of that declared mcgrath
the jokes on us and it is our place
to compliment you had we used a lit-
tle common sense we wouldnt have
fallen so hard am i right mr tal-
bot

  perfectly talbot replied and as he
spoke he met wards steady glance
mr kendrick deserves all the credit
our host carried out his plans very
cleverly indeed by the way is the
bashful crocodile for sale 

  a moment ago you said there was a
price for everything the art collector
replied

  what do you want with it asked
mcgrath

t well i might keep the picture as a
souvenir of my visit to america tal-
bot said and laughed

  not a bad idea powell agreed
any bid you care to make will be
accepted mr kendrick said

  thats fair enough chimed in mc-
grath we wont bid against you
talbot offer him nine-ninety-eight
cash

  ill tell you what ill do mr ken-
drick talbot announced ill give
you a signed check and you may fill in
the amount to suit yourself-the money
to go to any charity you suggest
done mr kendrick declared
the bashful crocodile is sold to mr
talbot will you take it with you or
shall i send it to your hotel

  ill take it with me later said
talbot

chapter vi

well young man

alhen the laughter that greeted the
ridiculous bargain had subsided
dudley appeared at the gallery door
sighted mr kendrick and came toward
him begging your pardon sir he
began but there is a gentleman in the
hall to see you-a reporter from the
review

  reporter what does he want
asked kendrick

  i dont know sir he insists upon
speaking with you

  send him away how many times
have i told you dudley not to encour-
age these chaps  i have nothing to say 
nothing the reviezv cares to hear at
least

  oh ho exclaimed powell your
jokes out already what do you know
about that talk about the wireless-
you cant keep anything from those con-
founded newspapers some one has
tipped them off

  its too good to keep vowed ward
why not let them have the straight of
it mr kendrick

  mr kendrick hesitated a moment
then as if wards suggestion had ap-


top-notch magazine

pealed to him he turned toward the
waiting butler all right dudley
show the reporter in here well see
how much he knows

  in here sir dudley questioned
surprised

  certainly were all interested
as the butler reluctantly obeyed mr
kendrick stepped over and quickly
closed the velvet curtains to screen the
bashful crocodile presently with
very scant consideration dudley bowed
the reporter into the gallery the news-
paper man came briskly forward-a
clean-cut dapper young chap with a
stick in the crook of his arm and a
tightly rolled cap in one hand mr
kendrick he inquired

 mr kendrick nodded whats
wanted joung man

  im from the review ive been
commissioned to get an interview and a
complete description of your new paint-
ing the reporter announced glibly

  how long have you been with the
review asked kendrick

  not very long the reporter ad-
mitted

  i thought so otherwise you would
know that i do not grant interviews
but the editor thought this was an
exceptional case mr kendrick said
the young man eagerly

  why so exceptional

  you have lately come into the pos-
session of so remarkable a painting that

it is only fair- the reporter

stopped and frowned as the guests with
one accord broke into shouts of laugh-
ter

  youve even buffaloed the press mr
kendrick powell cried

  mr kendrick however did not
smile what is this remarkable paint-
ing he inquired

  i was given to understand it was a
murillo the reporter answered

  another outburst greeted this state-
ment and the review representative
flushed he looked upon the faces about

him as if to seek an explanation well
young man mr kendrick announced
when the other men had quieted down
since you have fathomed the great se-
cret it is no more than fair that you
should have the honor to gaze upon the
masterpiece

  the reporters face brightened as mr
kendrick stepped back and with an
elaborate bow drew aside the velvet
curtains there followed a moment of
absolute silence in which the reporter
gazed wide-eyed and dumbly upon the
bashful crocodile the other men
watched him with unconcealed interest
then with an embarrassed grin the
review man turned questioningly to-
ward mr kendrick i beg your par-
don mr kendrick he began but
if-

  is that all the impression the murillo
has made upon you mr kendrick de-
manded with a show of indignation
is that all you can say

  i appreciate the joke the reporter
admitted smiling faintly

  joke is that the way you treat the
courtesy i have shown you 

  pm not an art critic mr kendrick
the other said but i know a joke when
i see one

  if youll look closely at the painting
youll see the artists signature mc-
grath broke in what better proof
do you want 

  get murillo on the phone said
powell hell verify the canvas
wheres your photographer in-
quired ward the reviezv will want
a photograph of the masterpiece

  the reporter looked so uncomfortable
and undecided that mr kendrick re-
lented and broke into the laugh he had
withheld young man he explained
that is the painting you have come to
see we wont prolong your suffer-
ing it is the nearest thing to a murillo
i have ever possessed tell your editor
that will you

  im afraid he wont believe me
the bashful crocodile



  why not asked kendrick
because the reporter answered
from the information he received to-
day he is certain that you have murillos
spanish lady none of the other pa-
pers has been tipped off and we intend
to score a beat it is understood that
you have given this house party for the
purpose of unveiling the masterpiece
i have been commissioned to get the
whole story mr kendrick

  say this is immense exclaimed
mcgrath the review has been stung
with the rest of us he turned upon
the reporter cant you appreciate the
situation young man youre not that
thick-headed are you  this is the first
day in april all fools day do i
make myself clear mr kendrick has
turned a neat little trick on all of us
to mcgraths chagrin as well as to
the surprise of the others in the room
the reporter did not accept the expla-
nation in the spirit he was expected to
show his countenance remained un-
ruffled heavens mcgrath went
on annoyed at the mans indifferent de-
meanor must i draw a diagram for
yon 

  i have come fifty miles for this
story the reporter said quietly and
im not going back to new york with-
out it

  at this deliberate and unexpected re-
joinder mr kendricks face hardened
perceptibly dudley he commanded
sharply kindly show this gentleman
out of the house 

  yes sir responded dudley

  the reporter bowed slightly and
walked to the gallery door where the
butler awaited him reaching there
he wheeled to face his observers i
only wanted to make it perfectly clear
to you mr kendrick he declared in
the same placid tone of voice that i
have not been deceived or misled by the
foolery when you see fit to treat this
matter in the proper way youll find me

at your service ill be within call
thank you good evening

  the departure of the confident re-
porter was followed by an interval of
tense and awkward silence on the part
of mr kendrick and the guests who
surrounded him fortunately the la-
dies and a few of the younger men had
left the gallery previous to the recently
enacted scene and were not aware of
the unpleasant interruption the sud-
den outburst of music from an adjoin-
ing room coming at that moment-as
if at an unhedrd cue-succeeded in a
measure in relieving the situation and
by the time dudley reappeared smiling
blandly over a task that obviously had
not been distasteful to him the conver-
sation was resumed

  unnoticed by his guests mr ken-
drick stepped out of the gallery when
he reached the corridor paula who had
followed him touched his arm

  father she said anxiously why
did you keep this surprise from me

  mr kendrick turned i did not
know it was to come he answered
quietly

  the girl stared at him dumbly as if
unable to grasp the significance of his
reply then as the truth came to her
suddenly cruelly she shrank back
against the wall with a low cry fa-
ther you did not know and the
murillo- her voice broke pite-
ously

  it is gone he said

  gone she echoed helplessly
where 

  i do not know it was there be-
hind the curtains this afternoon and
to-night when i drew the curtains aside

- he stopped and left the rest

why-why did you let the guests think
it was a joke you must tell them
the collector gazed steadily into his
daughters white face paula he said
-and his voice was stronger now-
you must say nothing of this do
you understand me nothing no
one must know

  the girl lifted her eyes the sight
of her fathers grimly set jaws checked
the torrent of questions that rushed to
her lips very well she answered i
will say nothing

chapter vii

the wrong door

oeveral of the men guests among
them talbot arid ward left the
gallery for more comfortable quarters
in the smoking room where dudley
passed around a well-stocked humidor
with an audible sigh of relief mcgrath
established himself in an easy-chair be-
fore the fire there was a chill in the
april air that succeeded in penetrating
brick walls and plaster and the cheery
warmth of a bright wood fire did not
come amiss

  to misquote kipling he observed
lighting his cigar with a deliberate and
enjoyable anticipation a picture is
only a picture but a good cigars a
smoke

 when ward and talbot drew up
their chairs before the fire the subject
of the reporters visit was mentioned
of all the impertinent cads mcgrath
expressed himself forcibly why
didnt he call mr kendrick a liar and
be done with it  if this had happened
in my house that reporter would have
been kicked out bodily

  the thing that puzzles me talbot
said is how the review got hold of
so absurd a story was some one try-
ing to hoodwink the editor

  mcgrath shook his head in my
opinion he ventured some of the fel-
lows in the newspaper office put up a

job on the new reporter-sent him
down here on a wild-goose chase the
older men know how mr kendrick de-
tests newspaper notoriety and wanted
the cub to tackle him

  he said he intended remaining on
the job until he got the story said
talbot

  hell lose his job if he stays too
long said mcgrath

  ward his mind still troubled over
the identity of the guest seated next to
him struggled with countless plans that
might tend to relieve his apprehension
only to discard them one after another
now that things had progressed so far
without unnecessary alarm ward felt
that he should have acquainted mr
kendrick with the situation he had so
unexpectedly uncovered at the time he
confided in paula it was mr ken-
dricks privilege to deal with the mat-
ter in whatever manner he saw fit and
proper ward felt that in keeping his
suspicions to himself he was doing his
host an injustice he had sought an
opportunity of speaking with the girl at
the conclusion of the dinner and again
following the scene staged in the gal-
lery  but his maneuvers failed on both
occasions he concluded at last that
paula either had dismissed her fears or
was trusting implicitly in his having
shouldered the responsibility both de-
ductions pleased him

  scarcely had ward settled back with
these comforting thoughts uppermost in
his mind when a new and disturbing
possibility ousted them the more he
pondered over the question the more
uncertain he became he stole a swift
and cautious sidelong glance at talbot
whose chair was within arms reach
but the object of his scrutiny appeared
to be absorbed in a problem of his own
building and seemed unconscious of the
look

  suddenly mcgrath bestirred himself
removed the cigar from between his
lips and directed a question at ward
the bashful crocodile



oh by the way he began didnt
you bring a picture here to-day
wards fingers playing a tattoo upon
the arm of his chair stiffened he saw
talbots countenance change percep-
tibly as the new subject was introduced
just because i brought a canvas with
me rolled up under my arm ward
said with a laugh i trust you do not
think ive made away with a mona
lisa

  oh hardly that mcgrath returned
good-naturedly but i overheard you
mention something about a picture
to mr kendrick early this afternoon
thats all perhaps you didnt want it
repeated youll pardon me if ive been
too curious he added

  the canvas really amounts to noth-
ing ward explained lightly a trifle
unusual in treatment and-well i pur-
chased it with a certain buyer in mind
i wanted to ask mr kendricks opinion
of its value

  whered you pick it up

  in boston was the reply

  oh mcgraths brows lifted at
hepplewaits  wards teeth sank into
his cigar as he nodded once in a
while hepplewait offers something
worth while mcgrath went on not
often though whats the subject
a landscape-rather broad and
sketchy-good in spots answered
ward itll appeal to the patron i have
in mind

  not one of bayleys is it talbot
inquired

  no ward shook his head grey-
monts

  that so talbot betrayed an im-
mediate interest hes done some very
excellent work in landscapes id like
to see the canvas mr ward if it isnt
asking too much

  certainly ward responded ill
be only too happy to show it to you
just remind me in the morning will
you i havent unpacked the prize

  thank you said talbot in a tone
that left little doubt of his appreciation
ill look forward to the privilege with
interest i assure you i might even
take the canvas off your hands he
added smilingly

  a few minutes later the group of
three dispersed ward finished his
cigar and went out to join paula and
the others in the big music room mc-
grath said he was far too comfortable
to be disturbed but added that he would
follow them presently im not much
for music he explained or dancing
either i wouldnt know a fox trot
from a canter

  talbot followed ward out of the
smoking room mr kendrick who had
reappeared upon the scene went for-
ward to meet the critic he was beam-
ing pleasantly and seemed to have en-
tered into the gay spirit of the evening
with as much zest and enjoyment as the
others

  im afraid i have neglected you tal-
bot he apologized quickly  but you
will have to pardon me this time ive
been showing the ladies how little i
know about the modern dances and
the-

  oh not at all talbot interrupted
the pleasure of the ladies is always
first and-and ive found mr ward
a most agreeable companion

  ward became aware not without con-
cern that talbot for all his apparent
interest in the other guests kept mr
kendrick and himself under a steady
surveillance for that reason he was
unable to confide his growing suspi-
cions to his host he did manage at
last however to draw paula aside and
speak with her concerning the matter
that had been too long delayed

  tell your fathers want to see him
miss kendrick he said in an under-
tone still conscious that talbot was
watching them from the opposite side
of the room

  have you found out anything


top-notch magazine

more  the girl questioned there was
an unlooked-for tremor in her voice

  nothing definitely answered ward
he searched the girls troubled counte-
nance narrowly as if to seek more in-
formation than she was willing to ex-
tend in words her obvious agitation
disturbed and puzzled him you must
not permit yourself to be unduly
alarmed he said quietly there is
nothing to fear whatever the outcome
may be im sorry now that i spoke to
you of the matter

  powell came up at that moment and
further comment was impossible ward
masked his feelings with a smile and
strolled away to be at once corralled
by an unsuspecting and talkative soap
manufacturer halsey he listened ab-
sently to halseys chatter but not being
in a particularly receptive mood to dis-
cuss the merits of a projected advertis-
ing scheme wherein the bashful croco-
dile was to play an important part he
managed to discourage his tormentor
and slip away

  during the time that ward was in
earnest conversation with paula talbot
was engaged with mr kendrick later
apparently preoccupied the critic mur-
mured something about joining mc-
grath for a final smoke and left the
room

  once out of sight however he quick-
ened his pace saw to his evident satis-
faction as he passed the doorway of
the smoking room that mcgrath was
sleeping peacefully in the big chair be-
fore the open fire tiptoed on reached
the foot of the stairs and swiftly as-
cended them

  on the upper floor he paused and
before venturing farther looked anx-
iously around the lights were burn-
ing low under the heavy shades and the
big hall was in semidarkness with a
resolute set to his shoulders and a
final questioning glance about him tal-
bot moved across the rug-strewn floor

and stopped in front of the door his
eyes had marked

  the knob turned readily in his fin-
gers and the door opened without ef-
fort talbot was just stepping into the
darkened room when a sound arrested
him and he stiffened suddenly

  like the genii summoned from the
air dudley appeared he came toward
talbot his face calm and immobile
i beg your pardon sir he said re-
spectfully but that is mr wtards
apartment yours is at the opposite
end of the hall sir

  oh talbot exclaimed stepping
back embarrassedly how stupid of
me i didnt realize where i was going
the doors are-are so very much alike

that-

  yes sir dudley agreed they
are rather confusing allow me to di-
rect you sir

  thank you talbot said as the but-
ler opened the right door and stepped
aside ill keep my wits about me next
time he added pressing a wadded
bank note into the servants hand he
watched as dudley bowed and moved
quietly down the hall in the direction
of the stairs then he stepped inside his
own room noiselessly turned the key in
the lock and listened with his ear
pressed against the panel of the door

chapter viii

wires down

the persistent ringing of a bell and
the sharp staccato reports of a
discharged firearm brought the guests
in the music room up on their feet with
an exclamation that was not lost upon
ward who instinctively whirled to face
his host mr kendrick darted out of
the room and ran down the long cor-
ridor toward the stairs ward and the
other mefi too astounded to question
the move yet confident that something
unusual had taken place followed

  in the upper hall dudley appeared
the bashful crocodile



and called out to attract the attention
of the excited guests

  its in mr talbots apartment sir
he cried

  led by mr kendrick the men rushed
into talbots room they found him
standing before an opened window a
revolver clutched grimly in his hand
but he was smiling

  whats the trouble mr kendrick
asked

  talbot more composed than any of
the others slowly turned to face his agi-
tated host sorry to create all this dis-
turbance mr kendrick he explained
but i thought to frighten away an un-
announced visitor

  visitor mr kendrick repeated
who was it where did you see
him

  i was standing in front of my
dresser talbot said when--i heard
a sound at this window  glancing up
i saw a mans face peering in at me
i made for him but he dropped--all
the way to the ground i fancy-and
started to run in my haste i fired
through the window after i succeeded
in opening it i tried to wing the man as
he darted across the lawn better have
some of your men search the grounds
mr kendrick he added significantly
i believe i hit the fellow

  dudley obeying a quick nod from
his employer hurried away the rest of
the men following him once outside
the guests scattered and searched the
darker parts of the lawn and the hedges
talbot soon joined them revolver in
hand and with ward and dudley ex-
plored the grounds in the vicinity of
the house

  i could have sworn that last shot
hit the fellow talbot declared appar-
ently as disappointed as his companions
i thought i saw him stumble

 there are no marks below the
window announced ward who had
dropped behind the others and was
flashing an electric torch over the lawn

it doesnt seem possible that a-

he broke off suddenly as the darting
shaft of light picked out an object in
the grass his hand shot out and
without being observed by the others
he secured the thing and slipped it into
his pocket

  what were you saying talbot in-
quired turning back to where ward
stood

  i said i didnt think it possible that
a man could drop from the window
ledge and alight on the ground without
leaving some evidence ward answered
quietly

  the ground is pretty well frozen
talbot said

  that might account for it

  the thing that puzzles me chimed
in powell measuring the distance with
a calculating eye is how the chap got
up to the window ledge in the first
place

  i was about to ask the same ques-
tion said mr kendrick how was it
done

  ward shook his head that seems
to be a mystery perhaps well find out
later

  the fellow was up there all right
talbot reiterated but how he reached
the ledge is something that i cant ex-
plain

  its a wonder the fellow didnt break
a leg said powell

  those chaps know how to fall said
talbot ready with an explanation

  shall i phone the police anxiously
inquired dudley

  not yet mr kendrick replied
theres no damage done-so far as we
know-and it isnt likely our visitor
will return besides im not going to
put a cloud on our house party by in-
viting a crowd of detectives  id rather
contend with a crook than a detective
any day

  i agree with you said talbot
laughing with the others

  during the absence of the men a


top-notch magazine

few of the women rushed to their re-
spective apartments to assure them-
selves that none of their belongings had
been taken quieted and relieved when
they found nothing had been disturbed
they gathered in the hall to await the
return of the posse

  when the men appeared shivering
and bareheaded-for none of them had
taken the trouble to don overcoat or
hat in the sudden rush to apprehend
the unknown visitor-they made a com-
mon move toward the smoking room
huddling gratefully about the open fire
which a thoughtful servant had replen-
ished

  enjoyable weather for a garden
fete said powell his teeth chattering
or a midnight dip in the pool i say
mr kendrick he went on as if the
question had just come to him what
was all that confounded bell ringing
sounded like a vaudeville musical act
on strike

  every window in the house is con-
nected with a burglar alarm the host
explained smiling it is a precaution
i have always taken we are three
miles from the nearest village and the
town constable-and im running no
chances

  a wise precaution agreed talbot

  i thought at first it was another of
your april-fool pranks declared pow-
ell then i heard the shots and saw
you make for the stairs and concluded
i was wrong

  our visitor displayed plenty of
nerve talbot remarked well have
to admit that he isnt the ordinary
sneak thief or the second-story man we
read about in the newspapers break-
ing into a house filled with people and
at this time of the night proves that
beyond a doubt

  must have had a big object in view
commented ward he saw mr ken-
drick start suddenly then as suddenly
recover himself

  mr kendricks house is naturally a

place to attract crooks-the big ones
said mcgrath whose peaceful slumbers
had been ended by the disturbance
this chap that talbot shot at never
came here to rifle coat pockets he
added significantly he had a more
important errand in mind

  if i hadnt been so badly rattled

i	might have trapped him talbot said
dismally

  you gave him a mighty good scare
maintained powell and thats a lot
more than i could have done

  it was fortunate that you had a re-
volver with you at the time ward
spoke up

  first time ive carried one in years
talbot answered

  is every one certain there has been
nothing taken ward asked looking
around him at the circle of interested
faces this might have been the mans
second appearance he added

  oh i-i hardly think so mr ken-
drick announced quickly

  there doesnt seem to be anything
missing from the rooms upstairs said
paula we went through them while
you were outside

  permit me to compliment you tal-
bot said with a laugh your bravery
is unquestionable ill never refer to
you as one of the weaker sex after this
we mustnt allow this affair to spoil
our evening the host declared quickly
they say lightning never strikes twice
in the same place and im sure the
argument holds equally in respect to
burglars

  of course it does powell said
on with the dance let joy be un-
confined  i read that somewhere in a
book he acknowledged but it is quite
in keeping with this occasion isnt it
following powells lead the guests
drifted away to the other rooms tal-
bot disappeared with paula mcgrath
settled down before the fire to enjoy a
smoke it was the opportune moment
ward had looked forward to and he
the bashful crocodile



hurried out into the hall to overtake mr
kendrick

  may i speak with you a moment
he asked reaching his hosts side

  certainly mr kendrick said
whats on your mind 

  i should have confided in you ear-
lier this evening ward said but cir-
cumstances interfered and-well i
didnt want to trouble you until i was
certain of my suspicions

  suspicions mr kendrick echoed
sharply what do you mean what
suspicions the smile faded from his
lips

  if i might speak with you alone
suggested ward

  with a promptness that astonished
ward his host turned and opened a
door leading into a small richly fur-
nished room once inside mr ken-
drick switched on the lights a big an-
tique desk ana well-filled bookcases
occupied one side of the room the tap-
estried walls were covered with many
unframed paintings on the broad
mantelpiece and on the several tables
and even ranged on the floor in apparent
disorder were porcelains of every con-
ceivable size and color bronzes and or-
naments in other metals

  ward looked about him in sheer
amazement nor was that amazement
entirely dispelled by mr kendricks
quiet laugh and explanation i call
this my junk pile mr kendrick said
and it looks it dont you agree now
what was it you wanted to confide in
me he went on after a pause you
may speak freely mr ward i do not
think we shall be interrupted-or over-
heard

  mr kendrick ward began quietly
determined not to waste any time in
preliminaries what do you know about
talbot 

  nothing except that he is a promi-
nent art critic who arrived on friday
from london he is the representative

of several wealthy european collectors
and-

  you never saw him until to-night
ward interrupted

  no

  i understand that he is a londoner
and that this is his first visit to this
country ward stated

  yes mr kendrick agreed

  then did you not wonder at his
american accent

  why i did notice it mr ken-
drick answered after a moment of re-
flection but i did not attach a great
deal of significance to the fact at the
time

  you are quite satisfied then that the
guest now in your house answering to
the name of talbot is the london
critic

  why i am fairly certain of it mr
kendrick replied apparently taken
aback by the very abruptness of the
question i am not in the habit of
cross-examining my guests before ad-
mitting them he went on in a slight
tone of resentment i mailed an invi-
tation to mr talbots hotel in new
york he promptly and courteously
acknowledged it and said he would be
delighted to visit me

  then so far this evening you have
found no reason to suspect that he is
other than the man you invited per-
sisted ward

  mr kendrick regarded his compan-
ion with a tolerant and questioning
glance what are you driving at
ward he demanded

  just this wrard answered swiftly
i am convinced that the mr talbot
you are entertaining is an impostor
by some trick which we may succeed
in uncovering later this man intercepted
the invitation you mailed and has
passed himself off as the critic be-
fore the astounded host could interrupt
him ward went on to relate minutely
the conversation that took place between
himself and talbot concerning the au-


top-notch magazine

thenticity of the canvas in the smoking
room

  i cant believe it mr kendrick ex-
claimed when ward paused for breath 
nevertheless the color drained from his
face as he continued its absurd
why should any one seek to gain ad-
mission to my home in so despicable a
manner

  i hardly think it necessary for me
to answer that question ward replied

  mr kendrick winced ever so slightly
and parted his lips as if to speak then
as if unwilling to voice the fear that
surged into his heart he checked the
impulse and remained silent

  ward watched him almost pityingly
mr kendrick he said at length in
quiet earnestness why do you want to
keep me in ignorance of what has taken
place 

  a sudden flame of resentment burned
in the collectors steel-gray eyes what
do you mean he demanded

  this evening after the canvas was
unveiled i purposely mentioned the fact
that to-day was the first of april i
did it to help you mr kendrick

  then paula has told you mr ken-
drick cried

 no said ward paula did not
tell me i was not aware that she knew
but from the very first i suspected i
did not believe that you had bidden
your friends here for the purpose of un-
veiling the bashful crocodile i couldnt
believe it

  mr kendrick sank into a chair now
that the truth had been suspected he
seemed resigned and at the point of
confessing the thing he had held back

when success meets success

igh in the seats of the happy is the editor who having fin-
ished his task of building the next number can feel that it
is going to give entertainment and delight to thousands and
thousands of readers it affords me keen pleasure to tell
you that the top-notch dated may th-the one to come to you on
that day-measures up to such a standard

    another source of joy for the editor is the knowledge that the
readers have scored a success-that is to say that they have suc-
ceeded in enjoying what the editor has prepared for them thus you
see successes meet and clasp hands eagerly the editor awaits evi-
dences of the readers success if you did not like the number he
would conclude that after all he did not build well for you-indeed
that he did not build for you at all but without being aware of it
for some other group of readers that would be a keen disappoint-
ment

a

v ll our effort as you know is to construct a worthy magazine
as well as one that shall receive your approval such an enter-
prise means a lot more to the publisher to-day than it did a few years
back--that is it means a lot more to the new kind of publisher time
was when a publisher as represented by an editor sat in his chair
and waited for good things to fall into his lap from the windfall
of the mails he chose the best or the worst or the intermediate and
his periodical was good bad or indifferent accordingly his position
was describable with the expression pretty soft

ut one day there arose another kind of publisher-one who en-
listed the services of an editor who did not wait for things to
come in but who went after them from that moment our slow-going
friend-and his magazine were out of date although he did not recog-
nize this at the time catching the events of life big or little wise


top-notch magazine

or foolish and causing them to be woven into tales that shall stir and
delight-there is a task demanding all that the new kind of publisher
can muster of alertness and skill but you do not wish to live always
in the strenuous present when you give yourselves up to the enjoy-
ment of fiction so well do we know it that some of the material used
in building for you is the stuff of which dear old romance may be made

tor example in the next issue of top-notch there is a story told
in a distinctly modern way a boxing tale yet its time is far
from the present and its people far from the men and women of our
day i suppose it would be called a colonial romance the title is
his sporting chance and the author is j c kofoed who gave us
a good tale of like strain some time ago you are going to enjoy this
work of mr kofoed i feel quite certain

s

  he same number will contain a laughable affair by j a fitz-
gerald called his elegance the janitor  another humor-
ous story-a baseball tale-is by frank x finnegan title hazlitts
alibi other athletic features are dorrances college rowing serial
as the arrow to the bow and a clever tennis story by octavus roy
cohen called advantage in the long complete novel is by wil-
liam macleod raine-law and the man-and i think you will say
it is one of the best things this popular author has ever given to the
public among the other attractions is a splendid railroad story by
the man who has made that type of fiction famous-william wallace

editor of top-notch magazine

  dear sir  although a new reader of your
magazine i enjoy it immensely i enjoy
especially the stories dealing with the
tropics and the west i have a few sug-
gestions  several authors lately have writ-
ten stories in which they show a lack
of acquaintance with some parts of this
continent and especially of that portion
bordering on to mexico edmond lawrence
in his novel jungle intrigue has this de-
fect i am from texas and have lived there
all my life so far i have not seen a native
texan who could not speak spanish and
never yet have i found one who was afraid
of the devil himself if i do have to say it

 one other suggestion why not have a
story with the scene of the plot laid in texas
say san antonio there is abundant mate-
rial there for hundreds of corking good sto-
ries

  under the whip is one of the best novels
i have read in a coons ae

  i hope the others will continue to be as
interesting

  with sword and spur was very interest-
ing and of a type i like with best wishes
for top-notch and its editor i am truly
yours	tex

irom newark new jersey we have
this the writer being o f hev-
ener of fourth street that city

  about the first thing i turn to when i pick
up t-n is the talks letters seem to
come from all parts of the united states yet
i have not seen more than one from new-
ark-that large city that is so near to the
home of t-n too

  there is something about top-notch that
is different from other magazines and i am
sure most of your readers will agree with me
there i have none of your authors to find
fault with the animal stories by harold
de polo are great stories written by your-
self fitzgerald r a phillips bertram
lebhar albert m treynor and the writer of

the silas q pinch stories are always good-
summed up top-notch is an all-around fine
magazine

  the only thing is i dont see where we
are getting more reading now for fifteen
cents than when we paid ten

  it is just this task of keeping top-
notch different as our correspond-
ent says it is that demands a different
kind of publisher as to the volume
of reading matter supplied now as con-
trasted with what was given at the old
price it can be seen easily that it has
been increased if any reader will
count the number of pages in the last of
the ten-cent issues he will see that in
the fifteen-cent form many pages have
been added

editor of top-notch magazine

  dear sir  kindly excuse me for taking up
your time but i could not resist the tempta-
tion of congratulating you there never
was isnt now or never will be any periodical
to come within a mile of top-notch

  its about time we got a boltwood of
yale serial again no knocks to authors
they are all good and its a long long way
to find a better combination hoping i have
not taken too much of your time i am

editor of top-notch magazine

  dear sir  as i am a reader of your ex-
cellent magazine and have been for about
three years i thought i would write you and
let you know you had a lot of admirers here
in ottawa although we dont see many let-
ters from these parts you will no doubt
be interested to learn that i have sent fifty
back numbers of top-notch to england for
the convalescing soldiers at the hospitals
there as they were too good to keep idle
when others needed them more than i did

  top-notch to my mind is absolutely the
best fiction magazine going to-day and i
ought to know magazines as i have run a
bookstore here in the city a couple of years
and have carried oyer one hundred different
magazines but the only one i look forward
to arriving for my own perusal is top-notch
and believe me i have to grab a copy quick
or they will all be gone

  i certainly wish you and all your writers
the best of success and prosperity yours
for good reading with the punch in it
