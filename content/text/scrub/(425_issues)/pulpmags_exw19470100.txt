a department for readers conducted by captain ranger

friends out in the growing pacific
northwest reconversion is more than a
fancy word theyre making it work
buckling down to post-war activity and
carrying out expansion plans have been go-
ing on for some time in that part of the
country

  were thinking particularly of prosser
washington seat of benton county down in
the south-central part of the state

  prosser pre-war was just another solidly
built western town set on the bank of the
yakima river with the famous horse heaven
hills rising to the south it was primarily a
shipping point for cattle and sheep from the
surrounding ranges

  prosser also has a flour mill-one of the
few remaining flour mills operated thanks to
the yakima river by water power

  before the first white men ever hit the dis-
trict indians used to camp at nearby yakima
falls each year during the annual salmon
runs

began as a trading post

  the town began as a trading post for the
vicinitys scattered ranchmen and the con-
struction crews of the northern pacific rail-
road at the time steel was pushing through
that was about  james kinney later
joined by colonel william prosser estab-
lished prosser as a permanent settlement

  thats the background of the place typi-
cally western rich in the lore and tradition
of tiie northwest

  along came the war and a little place
some forty miles away hanford suddenly
sprang into prominence a lot of people
worked there but nobody was quite sure
what they were doing hanford was a war
secret liie site of an atomic bomb factory

  with no large towns near it hundreds of
wartime workers in the atomic bomb plant
went clear to prosser for living accommoda-
tions

thus by a sort of reflex action prosser ex-

perienced a war boom some of the towns
larger houses were remodelled into apart-
ments space over the stores and office build-
ings along prossers cowtown main street
were made into rooms for war workers to
live in new residences were built as many
as could be under wartime conditions

  benton countys population about 
in  was close to  in  more
thousands were added in  and prosser
the countys largest town bore the brunt of
the bulge

  then the war ended prosser instead of
slumping back to its pre-war status recon-
verted its still reconverting

  of course business slowed down for a
time many of the war workers their war
job done went back to their original homes
but a whale of a lot of them stayed right
there

friendly country

  they liked prosser benton county and the
pacific northwest and they liked it well
enough to want to live there permanently
there was something about horse heaven
hills the yakima river the whole set-up that
made them want to stay it was a friendly
country

  new settlers have to have a means of mak-
ing a living thats problem number one-
anywhere prosser included in benton
county the answer seems to be agriculture

  not in old-fashioned starve one year and
make a crop the next farming fashion that
doesnt make for a stable economy but ir-
rigated farming  ah thats different and
in benton county practically at prossers
doorstep lies a large portion of the 
acres of new farm land embraced in the
roza division of the yakima irrigation proj-
ect the project itself is one of the biggest
irrigation undertakings of the u s bureau of
reclamation in the pacific northwest

when the project is completed it is due

 to bring irrigation water to some  new
 farm acres in benton county water is ready
 now for delivery to about  acres water
 for the rest should be available this coming
 year or certainly in the very near future

good soil

   and what about the local benton county
 soil that this water will moisten experts
 have classified close to  of the new farm
 land embraced in benton countys share of
 the irrigation project as no  grade that
 means it is considered most desirable for
 agricultural purposes on three counts-soil
 composition land topography and location

   when prosser started talking reconversion
 it had something to go on

   prosser got action some time ago no less
 than  new farms in this general section
 were being readied for  operation

   somewhere somehow the new settlers
 were finding lumber to build their homes
 and the chances are more new farms and
 more new homes have already been started

   among the many commodities these new-
 comers plan to raise or are raising now are
 turkeys chickens fruits vegetables potatoes
 and alfalfa theres a chance for dairy enter-
 prises too

   meantime the businessmen of prosser eye-
 ing their long established flour mill and con-
 templating a big increase in general crops
 once the new farmers really get going are
 reported doing a little figuring of their own

   they are carefully studying various kinds
 of processing plants they want to have
 them on hand to take care of the upsurge of
 crops and they want them right in prosser
 handy for the farmers and a local market
 for the farmers produce

   prosser already has one dehydrating plant
 and an airport a mile or so out of town it
 is that kind of town history behind it but
 its future still ahead of it

modern pioneering

   establishing a new farm home on new land
 in the west-not necessarily just in prosser
 or benton county or even washington but
 anywhere where land opportunities are
 available-is a grand goal it means a cer-
 tain sort of modern pioneering and it means
 a lot of hard work

   yet for the person with a green thumb or
 real love of agriculture and livestock in his
 makeup farming as a way of life has com-
 pensations that transcend mere dollars and
 cents considerations it is not all drudgery

   farm community living is a friendly
 neighbor-help-neighbor sort of life and

 of them in the long run than the average
 city dweller or city worker ever gets

   and dont forget in the final analysis
 farmers are the backbone of the nation ttiey
 and they alone are the ultimate source of
 any countrys food supply they grow its
 grain and raise its meat

capital needed

   as far as new unbroken irrigated farm
 land in the west is concerned the prospective
 settler needs at least a certain amount of
 capital to get started on think it over and
 youll soon see why

   buildings must be put up so must fences
 the land itself after being laid out as to its
 future use-crops pasture orchard etc-
 must be cleared and prepared irrigation
 ditches have to be built

   altogether it may take anywhere from 
 to  years to bring the new farm up to the
 point where annual produce or crop sales
 exceed operating costs almost certainly it
 will take the lower figure- years

   that is a concrete problem the new settler
 has to face and one the inexperienced are
 apt to overlook

a long hard pull

   so if you or you and your family cant
 take the long hard pull needed to get you
 over the hump youd better skip the whole
 idea pioneering is not for you

   on the other hand if you are willing to
 accept inconvenience perhaps even hardship
 at first the land is there and so is the op-
 portunity the new farms around prosser
 are just a start a drop in the bucket com-
 pared to the land available the west is a
 mighty big country and it is still growing

   irrigation farming is the modern trend in
 the west it is opening up to agriculture
 huge blocks of potentially rich farm land
 hitherto unsuitable for crop production be-
 cause of lack of sufficient natural moisture

   irrigation provides ground moisture when
 and where it is needed but it doesnt plan
 your farm for you that is something you
 have to do yourself according to your per-
 sonal preference experience and the possi-
 bilities of the land

   generally speaking the most common type
 of irrigated farm in the pacific northwest
 is diversified usually alfalfa is the major
 crop in addition some land is customarily
 reserved for good irrigated pasture part
 of the acreage is almost always devoted to

when yuhre rich

a telegram from stormy knight
deputy sheriff of apache butte to
jim keaton secretary of the cattle-
mens association read

tombstone and speedy left here in a buggy

wearing boiled shirts patent leather shoes
and perfume might end up at the astor
hotel in turquoise city

  jim keaton puzzled over this telegram he
knew that his two cowboy detectives had re-
ceived six thousand dollars reward for the
capture of one red mask and the clearing
up of a mystery in red horse valley
though they had never made a report to him

a complete tombstone and speedy novel


	exciting western

  another thing he knew was that they
would not be worth a plugged nickel to him
as long as that money lasted which would
be shortly after they met up with a roulette
wheel so jim keaton sent them a wire to
the astor hotel at turquoise city and
waited for results

  in the meantime tombstone jones and
speedy smith were not too happy with
their new-found wealth they had sold their
horses and saddles and bought a horse and
buggy they also had thrown away their

tombstone jones

warsacks and bought two shiny valises into
which they had stuffed their range clothes

  while they were not exactly visible in the
darkness and inside the confines of a top-
buggy tombstone jones was close to seven
feet tall and skinny enough to hide behind a
six-by-six his slatlike body was encased in
a pin-striped suit wide enough but much
too short patent-leather shoes white silk
shirt and a blazing red tie his pearl-colored
fedora was a full size too small

  speedy smith was only five feet seven
inches tall but was a small replica of tomb-
stone jones his garb was identical with
that of tombstone except that speedys hat
was too big they did not think to trade
hats thinking was not their forte

  it was about ten oclock at night with
a full moon and they had been driving for
hours

   done told yuh we should have taken that
right-hand fork speedy said

  a road said tombstone philosophically
must go somewheres

  we aint headin for somewheres-were
headin for turquoise city

  good

  i dont mean on this road weve been
bearin south

  listen said tombstone you cant tell
east from west in the daytime how can yuh
tell directions at night

  i went to night school

  oh well thats different mebbe we are
on the wrong road yuh know speedy
after all it dont make no difference when
yuhre rich yuh dont care where yuh are
rich speedy spat dismally rich
ridin in a buggy dressed up like a blasted
dude im still sticky from that champagne
twelve dollars a bottle too and whatd
we get out of it

  yeah it didnt linger long agreed tomb-
stone but it made a awful pretty noise
when the cork blowed out mebbe it was the
heat but when yuhre rich-shall we open
the other bottle

  no i want to meet up with turquoise
city and get somethin to eat this road
dont look like it was used much

  its got to go somewheres insisted
tombstone yuh dont just build roads
without yuhve got a place in mind for em to
go

  it was a narrow road barely wide enough
between the mesquite and cactus for a single
vehicle to travel crooked too the moon-
light was not too bright suddenly tomb-
stone drew up the horse which had been
plodding slowly

  thought i heard some shots he said
they listened

  i didnt hear nothin except hunger
gnawin at my stummick said speedy sort
of a raspin sound

  tombstone slapped the lines on the horses
rump and they went on

  if we stay on this road long enough he
said well git somewheres

  at the speed yuhre drivin it wont do us
any good said speedy well starve to
death long before that

  tombstone took the whip from the socket
and the horse broke into a trot which wasnt
so pleasant on that wash-board road speedy
shoved his fedora out of his eyes as they
started around a sharp curve

  he-e-ey tombstone yelled look out
yuh-

  his yell came too late to do any good
three riders traveling at full speed were
into them and the resulting crash was quite
terriffic the air was full of flailing feet
pieces of buggy and startled profanity
trail of the flame		

gradually the dust settled a man was in
the middle of the road flat on his back near
him was a saddled horse its neck twisted
grotesquely

  what there was left of the buggy was up-
side down and the buggy horse was tangled
up in the mesquite from the wreckage of
the buggy like a slow-motion jack-in-a-box
arose tombstone jones he adjusted the
hat he didnt have on and stared around in
a dazed sort of way

  well we got somewhere didnt we he
said

  speedy jones crawled out of the mesquite
minus half of his pin-striped suit and got
up on his slightly-bowed legs

  we stopped somewheres too seems to
me he said

  whozzat out there asked tombstone
looks dead to me

well replied speedy i reckon hes the
other half of the collision hyah feller
the man didnt move tombstone stum-
bled over and looked at him the man wasnt
dead but he was awful quiet in sleep

  might blame us for it yuh know speedy
said

  yea-a-a-ah breathed tombstone got
to get goin i reckon hate to walk

  weve still got a hoss said speedy
waitll i get him loose mabbe we can ride
him

  the buggy horse didnt seem hurt much
speedy uncinched the saddle from tht dead
horse and cinched it on the buggy horse
which didnt seem too pleased over the
operation speedy had less of his pin-striped
suit than tombstone they had both lost
their hats tombstone got their valises
from the smashed buggy and held them
while speedy got into the saddle

  this here quadruped panted speedy
is more used to pullin than liftin whoa
yuh jughead

 tombstone managed to get up behind
speedy each of them trying to hang onto
their valises and stay with the horse too
then they heard two voices

  i dont know what happened i tell yuh
a man wailed somethin hit me

  hit me too said the other man h-o-
omer yoo-hoo homer

  hes pagin homer said speedy cmon
bronc-we dont want to answer questions
our name aint homer said tombstone
and booted the horse

  the horse lurched ahead trying to pitch
but the burden was too great for him to more
than go through the motions behind them
one of the men yelled something and a

moment later a bullgt almost skidded off
tombstones right shoulder

  luckily there was another sharp turn in
the road and they went out of sight of the
shooter the horse discovering that buck-
ing was of no avail elected to run that
was exactly what was needed

  a mile further on with the horse ready to
call it quits they came to a fork in the road
the right-hand fork said

turquoise city-two miles

i told yuh crowed tombstone that if

speedy smith

yuh stay on a road long enough-well yuhre
shore to go somewheres

  and meet some fascinatin people added
speedy yuh know i dont know why we
hightailed it away from there so fast them
fellers was as much to blame as us

  yeah i reckon they was-but that feller
with the gun didnt think so just a im-
pulsive person i reckon lookin at it any
way yuh want to it was a awful thing to
happen to a wealthy man

 how do yuh figger that	

  it busted all seven seegars in my pocket
and well never get that bottle of champagne
back

  it wasnt no good anyway all i hanker
for is some food and a soft bed for to lie the
carcass i tell yuh im tired

  it has been a long ride agreed tomb-
stone yuh get kind of cramped in a
buggy

  they finally came in sight of the lights of
turquoise city and speedy guided the
horse off the road
exciting western



  we aint there yet pardner tombstone
said

  i know we aint slide off will yuh
aint nobody goin to put me in jail for
stealin a saddle im goin to hang this
hull up in this here mesquite thicket and
turn the hoss loose well walk into town

  yea-a-ah agreed tombstone mebbe
yuhre right- as much as i hate to walk
yuh dont figger theyll make any trouble
do yuh

  well they shot at us and yuh cant figger
that as friendly

  speedy wormed his way into the thicket
and hung up the saddle the horse stripped
of riding gear wandered away probably re-
lieved to get away from them while they
took their valises and plodded down the
dusty road to turquoise city

  old jim shane keeper of the astor hotel
stared across his little desk as they came
into the lobby neither of the two cowboys
was more than partly dressed and both
were scratched and bruised one of tomb-
stones pants legs was tom off at the knee
and the other knee was sticking through a
long rent in the fabric speedys coat was
slit down the back making it difficult for
him to keep it on his thin shoulders

  they came up to the desk and dropped
their valises

  have yuh got any rooms asked speedy

 why-huh-yea-a-ah said old jim
yeah weve got rooms the bridal suite
aint in use its four-bits a day extra

  what for asked tombstone

  two winders the other rooms aint got
but one

  speedy rubbed his sore nose well take
it he said and then we can both look out
at the same time

  is there anything to see in turquoise
city asked tombstone

  there is now replied the old man go
right up the stairs and its the second door on
the right

  and another item said speedy where
can we get some supper

  up the street a little ways-high hops
place

  shall we go up there now asked speedy

  tombstone shook his head in our posi-
tion he said soberly we must dress for
supper

  they went limping up the stairs carrying
their valises old jim shane squinted after
them until they disappeared in the dark hall-
way he shook his head and grinned slowly

  is there anything to see in turquoise
city he grunted id tell a man-and it

just went upstairs

  they came down in a few minutes and
found a man talking with old jim shane
he had a telegram for tombstone from jim
keaton which speedy read it said

no report from you do you think i am
a mind reader

  can yuh send a telegram for me asked
speedy

  shore the man said im from the
depot

  speedy wired jim keaton collect

we dont think so better try a
crystal ball

chapter ii

a man named jones

ubquoise city so
called because there
were no turquoises in
that vicinity was mere-
ly a sand-blasted cow-
town three miles from
the mexican border sur-
rounded on all sides by
desert hills the astor
hotel resembled any
other astor hotel in
name only

 the next morning
tombstone and speedy sat on the rickety
porch and smoked cigars both of them
hated cigars but smoking them they
thought made them look important good
two-bit cigars too when you bit the end
off and blew through them youd get more
dust than you would out of a vacuum-
cleaner they had been aged in the box

  tombstone gestured grandly and show-
ered himself with ashes and pieces of burn-
ing cigar wrapper	j

bein rich is a grand feelin he declared
yuh know i feel sorry for-whoa nellie

  tombstone flung the cigar into the street
and dug deeply into his shirt his features
anguished

  dad-blamed leaves he wailed caught
my undershirt on fire seegars may be the
trade-mark of a millionaire but they shore
irk me a heap they smell bad too

  thats yore undershirt said speedy

  it was getting hot on the porch so they
went inside

  old jim shane was half-asleep behind
his desk when a man came in he was
a short fat man wearing riding-pants well-
polished english riding boots a cutaway

the five men had no chance to
dodge before tombstones sorrel
crashed into them sending them
spinning
		exciting

 coat and a derby hat he was also carrying
 a crop in his gloved hand he was as out-
 of-place in turquoise city as a brass door-
 knob on a pup tent

   old jim peered over the counter-top at
 the man

   somethin i can do for yuh he asked

    am looking for a man named jones the
 mart announced in asthmatic tones

   old jim squinted thoughtfully for a mo-
 ment or two

   jones eh oh yeah thats jones over
-there

   the fat man looked tombstone over from
 his boots to the battered stetson he wore in
 place of the lost fedora the man didnt
 seem to miss a single detail he looked back
 at old jim 

   surely there must be another he said
 outside of him replied the hotel
 keeper were fresh out of joneses

   humf snorted the fat man and headed
 for the doorway

   yuh might try later suggested old jim
 yuh never can tell when well get a new one
 in here

   but the fat man didnt seem interested
 because he kept on going no one said any-
 thing for a while and then speedy said
 awful choosey aint he what could he
 expect-bjrthe name of jones

   what do yuh reckon that fancy feller
 wanted asked tombstone

   sounded like he was lookin for a man
 named jones said the hotel man quietly
 but you didnt suit him mebbe yuh was
 too tall yuh see a man with as much
 money as hes got can have any length
 jones he wants i reckon

 got lots of money asked tombstone
 that is homer g gates said old jim
 yuh mean to say that that feller is homer
 g gates asked the astonished tombstone
 yuh mean hes really homer g gates
 did yuh ever hear of him before asked
 speedy

   no admitted tombstone i never did
 but he shore wore some awful pretty
 clothes and i could smell him clear over
 here but whyd he be lookin for me
 speedy shook his head and looked at old
 jim

   not only is he too long for any bed and
 doubles up on me at night said speedy
 but i have that to contend with too  
 we all have burdens to bear i reckon
 said old jim say i forgot to tell yuh
 that another telegram ffime for yuh early
 this mornin ive got it in my desk

   it was troxa jim fatan and said

western

a man will contact you there make yocr
own salary deal mail me detailed report
on red horse valley deal

  they wandered back to the hotel porch
and sat down out on the sidewalk close
to the porch was homer g gates talk-
ing with two tall hard-looking men who
wore range clothes

  were not tryin to be hard on anybody
gates one of them said we had a gun-
fight last night with three men who came
across the border and didnt stop at our
challenge they got away and we dont
know who they were but today we found
a dead hoss on the road to yore ranch the
saddle had been stripped off-and the hoss
wears yore seven cross brand

  i sometimes sell horses said gates
vaguely after all gentlemen i cannot be
held responsible on such evidence

  weve told yuh several times gates-
said the other man that yore son is travelin
in bad company verde vista is no place
for him dont blame us if he ends up in
a federal prison

  federal prison asked gates huskily
thats right were goin to stop this
dope smugglin and we dont care who it
hurts	 

  smuggling ridiculous my son wouldnt
smuggle drugs he has  the money he
needs he doesnt have to make money
weve warned yuh said the man dont
blame us

the two men came up on the porch
looked sharply at tombstone and
speedy as old jim shane came to the door-
way

  weve been layin down the law to gates
one of the men said to him grinning that
fool kid of his is monkeyin with dynamite
spendin his time down at verde vista jim
yuh aint heard about anybody smashin up
a buggy last night have yuh

  old jim rubbed his stubbled chin and his
eyes shifting for a fraction of a second to
tombstone and speedy

  bustin up a buggy he parroted no
i aint al how come

  wed like to know down the road a
piece kind of looks like a rider might have
crashed the buggy hoss broke its neck
and the saddle was taken away we-me and
ed-had a run-in with two three riders from
verde vista they wouldnt stop

huh grunted old jim quietly well
if i hear anything ill shore let you knpw
much obliged jim see yuh later 
trail of the flame

 the two border patrolmen went away and
old jim sat down on the porch

 what sort of an hombre is gates son
tombstone said

 oh him yuh mean homer the second
how come hes second asked tomb-
stone

  shortage of names in the family i reckon
named him after his pa

 it sounds like homers readyin himself
to be a prodigal remarked speedy

  homer the second said old jim aint
exactly a credit to the human race hes
fat-headed and ignorant drinks like a fish
and thinks he owns the earth aint morn
twenty hes got a sister crowdin nineteen
id estimate which is awful good-lookin
but his ma is tall and hefty with as mean
a eye as ive seen since geronimo sur-
rendered its been said aloud that homer
g gates didnt raise his daughter- name
of gloria- to fall in love with no cowboy

 gates bought out the seven cross which
is kmowed now as the casa del rey big
spread bein a old spanish grant cost
him a fortune i reckon aims to use it as
a restin spot and raise fancy cows and fast
hosses

 old jim yawned and went back into the
hotel

 yuh know what tombstone said me
and you have got to buy a couple hosses
and saddles lets look over at the feed
corral mebbe we can pick up somethin
the owner of the feed corral was inter-
ested he had two awful good horses prob-
ably the best horses that ever wore shoes
saddles well he had two but hed hate to
sell them too reasonable first-class saddles
were hard to find course he was a little
shy on money these days so he might sell
they got the horses and saddles

 its a funny thing speakin about sad-
dles the corral man said i was hearin
two of the border patrol men tellin about
somebody takin a saddle off a dead hoss
last night

 whats funny about that asked speedy
they dont usually bury em with the saddle
on do they

  no they dont but last night a loose hoss
wandered in here no bridle nor saddle but
his sweat marks showed that hed been
saddled and rode awful hard i never seen
the hoss before and i aint never seen that
brand before

 mebbe they also unsaddle live hosses
around here too suggested speedy
yeah i reckon so i never gave that a
thought

  the man made out the bill-of-sale

  yore names jones eh i heard homer
g gates askin about that name today he
owns the casa del rey mebbe he was lookin
for you-i dont know hes homer the
seconds pa

do you know homer asked speedy
im shore youll like them two hosses
gents replied the man deliberately ignor-
ing the question ill keep em fed up for
yuh

  two riders came into turquoise city late
that afternoon tombstone watched them
dismount

  if that aint elmer higgins he said to
speedy ill go upstairs and eat that mis-
fit valise i dont know the other one
whos elmer asked speedy

  oh just a acquaintance of mine i got
him out of jail over in new mexico once
used yore influence queried speedy
nope-a hack-saw we was in there to-
gether

  yuhve shore had some awful moral
friends in the past sighed speedy

  got some yet said tombstone

in a moment the man designated as elmer
higgins left his companion and came
over to the hotel he stepped up on the
porch stopped short and stared at tomb-
stone who said quietly

  hyah elmer

  old hack-saw jones elmer said

  meet speedy smith elmer said tomb-
stone hes my pardner

  they shook hands and elmer sank down
in a rickety chair tombstone squinted at
the badge on elmers shirt elmer was as
bow-legged as a barrel-stave and chewed
tobacco

  the worst outlaws sometimes make the
best officers tombstone said

  well mebbe said elmer ill make yuh
a deal jones if yuh dont say nothin about
my past ill keep my mouth shut too im
still usin the same name

  som i said tombstone i changed it
several times but never could remember
the name i took awful embarrass in
elmer so yuhre a deputy sheriff

  elmer spat over the railing and nodded
uh-huh been one for over a year me
and dan oleary the sheriff just rode in
yuhll like dan oleary

  why asked tombstone

  well for one thing he aint nosey

  did yuh come down here for anythin

exciting western

thousand dollars a head he owns the casa
del rey spread some rich hombre they

lmer bow-legged his
way across the street to
the silk hat saloon
where sheriff dan o-
leary had met homer
g gates and his fore-
man slim cantrell
they all went back to
the hitch-rack where
they wouldnt be over-
heard and began a long
discussion slim can-
trell was tall and
slender wore a small
mustache scanty side-burns and his garb
ran to colors and silver ornaments

  awful pretty foreman remarked speedy
kinda glittery said tombstone but
yah can expect anything on a ranch where
they dont brand their hosses thousand-
dollar broncs-and not a mark man this
coold have been a hoss-thiefs paradise

  tt kinda looks like it was observed
speedy somebody got away with thirty
thousand dollars worth

  and i got twenty-nine dollars for thirty
head once sighed tombstone

  was that why yuh turned honest asked
speedy

  it was what yuh might call a contributin
factor speedy	

  oh-ohi grunted speedy company com-
w

the four men were coming over from the
hitch-rack with the sheriff in the lead they
came up on the porch

which one of yuh is jones the sheriff
asked

 its thisn dan said elmer pointing
 tombstone this is dan oleary the sheriff

howdy said tombstone yeah im

the sheriff looked him over carefully

sociation he asked bluntly

 er g gates

 cmon elmer

and added homer g gates you might
also iind out who ran into my son last night
killed his horse and stole his saddle

 not seriously

next time said speedy soberly mebbe
hell stop when the border patrol yells at
him

homer g gates looked bleakly at speedy
but made no comment the sheriff and dep-
uty looked questioningly at speedy expect-
ing him to elaborate but speedy went no
further

we might as well go back to the ranch
mr gates slim cantrell said

 yes yes i suppose so replied the fat
 man testily and went away with slim

we might as well go too said elmer
see yuh later tombstone nice to have met
yuh speedy

thats always a matter of opinion
speedy said and grinned   

 a little later mrs homer g gates and her
 daughter came to turquoise city in a two-
 seated buggy driven by a cowboy tomb-
 stone almost fell over the porch railing try-
 ing to get a good look at the daughter

 man alive he gasped shes as pretty
 as a pitcher

 speedy went over to the railing rolling a
 cigarette gloria gates turned and looked
 straight at him as the two women headed for
 the general store

 shes average speedy said then lighted
 the cigarette threw it away and put the
 match in his mouth

 im just wonderin paid tombstone if
trail of the flame	

  homer g gates needs a good cowhand on
  his place

    and you with three thousand dollars
  asked speedy

    yea-a-ah thats right i plumb forgot my
  wealth thats what love does to yuh yuh
  forget everythin man is she pretty
  tombstone leaned back and closed his eyes
  if i had a woman like her theres no tellin
  how far fd go

    hie same thing applies to stealin a hoss
  said speedy

   love and business aint the same
  speedy

    they watched the women come back and
  get into the buggy but neither mrs gates
  nor her daughter looked toward the hotel
  porch

    shes probly scared of her ma said
  speedy didnt want her to know she made
  eyes at us

   us queried tombstone she was
  a-lookin at me

    were pardners aint we

   always arguin im goin to get some-
  thin to eat and then im goin to find a poker
  game i need exercise

  tombstone found the poker game but
  the stakes were not high enough for a
  man of his means however it was good
  practise

    it was not interesting to speedy he talked
  with the bartender and had a few drinks
  speedy mentioned verde vista

    thats a good place to keep away from
  the bartender said quietly

    whats wrong with it

    poco topete and his gang

    what do they do for a livm asked
  peedy

    smugglin mostly i reckon the border
  officers got wind of a big jewel deal though
  and theyre shore watchin close id shore
  like a chance to grab off a cargo of diamonds
  yuh can turn em in to the federal officers
  and get twenty-five per cent of the value of
  the diamonds

    or keep em and get a hundred per cent
  huh asked speedy

    well yuh can let yore conscience be yore
  guide i reckon

    speedy wandered outside and walked over
  to the hotel he was out of tobacco and the
  stores were closed so he would have to go
  to the room where he had a supply old
  jim shane was behind his counter reading

in a flash tombstone was op
his gun out covering the door-
way
	exciting

a dog-eared old book his glasses out near
the end of his nose as speedy passed through
the lobby

  speedy went up to the room and went in-
side he had started for the table fumbling
for a match when something hit him on the
head his consciousness went out in a show-
er of shooting stars   

 it was an hour later when tombstone
sauntered into the hotel old jim shane was
still behind the counter reading tombstone
asked him if he had seen speedy

  oh he went up to the room an hour ago
old jim replied and i aint seen him since
probly gone to bed

  tombstone rubbed his chin thoughtfully
and headed for the stairs it was not like
speedy to go to bed that early

  reaching the room tombstone lighted a
match and looked around then he lighted
the lamp and looked the room over again
the two valises were empty flung aside the
contents scattered the bed had not been
occupied on the floor was one of the teler
grams from jim keaton the one telling them
that a man would contact them there

  tombstone sat down rolled a cigarette and
tried to puzzle out what had happened there
was a discolored spot on the old rug and he
tested it with his finger it was still damp
and decidedly red

  tombstone went into the hallway and made
his way to the rear stairway with lighted
matches he examined the steps a trickle of
blood had zigzagged its way clear to the
bottom

  someone had slugged speedy in the room
and had taken him down the rear stairway
they had also examined their belongings in
the room and that telegram linked them def-
initely with the cattlemens association but
they had done nothing to incur the enmity of
anyone in turquoise city and they were not
working for homer g gates

  tombstone went back to the little lobby
old jim peered at him over his glasses

  did yuh find him he asked

  tombstone leaned on the counter

  yuh aint seen nobody around here this
evenin have yuh he asked

  no i aint-except yore pardner aint
he up there

  yuh hadnt ort to say aint  replied
tombstone quietly it aint good english
jim anyway he aint there our stuff has
all been pawed around and theres blood on
the carpet and plumb down the back stairs

 blood queried old jim did yuh say
blood

  tux-huh-red  stuff the kind yuh get

western

when yuh cut yourself

  old jim stared at tombstone his eyes
squinted

  blood huh well mebbe he had a nose-
bleed

 ye-a-ah-mebbe breathed tombstone
thatd make him throw our stuff all over
the room and go down the back stairs
somebody laid for him up there-and
knocked him cold

  why asked old jim blankly
tombstone sighed cuffed his hat over one
eye and stared at the floor

  im out of answers to that one he said
wait a minute grunted old jim i be-
lieve the sheriff and deputy are stayin out
at the casa del rey

  aw they wouldnt do it said tombstone
ive got to look for who done it myself-
and i dont know where to look

  i didnt mean that they done it theyd
help yuh i think

  you thank em for me will yuh asked
tombstone and went out 

down in the rocks and mesqijifi
from the border was a litw shack
pretty well hidden away shorty- deal a
desert rat lived there shorty w mostly
hair whiskers and hopes it was after mid-
night that night when a lone horseman came
down through the mesquite and rode up to
his door

  shorty he called this is al stevens
after a few moments the door opened and
the man went into the little shack shorty
lighted a candle and placed it on the table
his visitor was a tall man clad in cowboy
raiment hard-faced in the flickering candle-
light he sat on the one chair while shorty
sat on the edge of his bunk

  al stevens was one of the border patrol
hard-riding cold-jawed minions of border
law and because shorty spent some of his
time in verde vista at times he was a source
of valuable information to the patrol

  stevens rolled and lighted a cigarette pass-
ing the match to shorty who lighted an old
pipe

  whats new shorty asked stevens
shorty shrugged not much al he re-
plied theres somethin wrong in verde
vista it strikes me that some of them smart
hombres have been hit in the pockets just
how i dont know

 how do yuh mean shorty

  well al-shorty puffed thoughtfully-
did yuh ever hear of the flame of the tem-
ple

 flame of the temple why i-yeah i
trail of the flame

have thats a diamond

  i figgered it was al diamond charley
wong and a man named stone are down
there been there five six days and they
aint happy seems like i couldnt get a
whole lot-little here and a little there poco
topete and charley and this stone-

  is stone short and fat wears glasses
thats right do yuh know him
know about him hes from frisco keep
talkin shorty-it makes sense

  like i told yuh i only get a little bit
here and there i did hear that the flame of
the temple is too big to handle theyve got
to get it cut into small pieces too risky the
way it is

  correct theyve got to get it to a crook
who can cut it for them but where is the
stone now

  i dont know piecin everything together
the thing is too valuable for any one man to
buy it even in mexico i dont know what
the deal is i heard stone say to another
man thirty or forty thousand is too much
to lose but weve got to take the chance
that was-five six days ago

  yuh dont reckon theyve lost the thing
do yuh shorty

  i dont know but i do know they aint
happy

  are yuh goin back

  tomorrow i reckon ill be back in two
three days al mebbe i can hear more
much obliged shorty

  al stevens ground the light from his cig-
arette and went back to his horse

chapter iv

below the border

o	ideas came to tomb-
stone jones about where
to look for speedy he
saddled his horse after
finding that speedys
horse and saddle were
still in the stable and
rode south he knew it
was dangerous to carry
arms into mexico but
danger didnt mean
much to tombstone
jones

  there was no one at the border line to stop
him so he rode on to verde yista

  a bright moon lighted the dusty old road
where it wound off a low mesa and down to

the little mexican town with its one street

   



and scattered adobes there was one two-
storied adobe with a -red-tiled roof which
might have been a mission but wasnt it
was la golondrina cantina apparently the
only lighted building in verde vista

  tombstone tied his horse at a deserted
hitch-rack and went up near the cantina
he could hear a mexican orchestra playing
and the usual sounds of revelry from such
an establishment now that he was in verde
vista he didnt know just what to do he
moved around behind the cantina and sat
down in the heavy shadow of an old adobe
stable

  to his left was a low wing of the cantina
unlighted which might have been used for
living quarters or storage he could hear
the sounds of horses in the stable and from
back in the hills came the weird yapping
howl of a coyote as though protesting against
the orchestras rendition of la paloma

  then the door of the low wing opened and
a man came out he was in the heavy
shadow hardly visible except from the glow
of his cigarette then three more men came
out and all four of them came to the stable
one of the men was either intoxicated or a
prisoner because two of the men were
guiding him

  tombstone sagged there in the shadows
and waited they brought out three horses
and one man was already mounted after a
few words spoken too quietly for tomb-
stone to hear them the three men rode
away and the fourth went back to the can-
tina

  tombstone hurried down to his horse
cut in between two adobes circled back to
the old stable and took the trail of the
three men it was an old road heading due
south tombstone was sure that one of the
men was a prisoner the man was too big
to be speedy but he wanted to see where
they were taking him anyway

  tombstone didnt dare ride fast for fear
of overtaking the men because the road was
narrow crooked hemmed in an all sides by
desert growth about four miles south of
verde vista the road came to an end at an
old adobe ranchhouse hidden away in a
grove of ancient sycamores

  tombstone rode into the heavy shadow
behind the stable and tied his horse three
saddled horses were tied near the front of
the house and while tombstone looked the
place over two of the men he had followed
came out mounted and started back leading
the extra horse there was not a light show-
ing in the ranchhouse
	exciting

  there was a big corral in which a sizable
herd of horses were held tombstone was
unable to see their brands but he had a
feeling that these were homer g gates
missing polo ponies tombstone circled the
old adobe ranchhouse but came back to the
stable deciding to wait until daylight to
make any investigation

  it was probably the longest night tomb-
stone had ever spent screech owls in the
sycamores and coyotes in the hills never
seemed to get tired of their own voices a
chill wind did not help the situation and
when daylight finally came tombstone was
stiff and weary

 when he saw smoke coming from the old
chimney he moved in close to the rear en-
trance waiting for someone to appear the
door opened and out came a lean stringy-
looking mestizo half-breed mexican and
yaqui he yawned and began picking up
some scattered mesquite roots for the fire

  tombstone stepped around the corner not
over ten feet from the man the surprise
was complete the man jerked back his
black eyes registering panic but gradually
he regained control of his nerves

  hyah tombstone said

  the end of the mans tongue moistened his
lips

  no entenderhe replied

 tombstone smiled slowly the man was
clad in a loose-fitting colorless old shirt
faded overalls and alpargatas hemp sandals
he had no visible weapons

  are yuh alone here tombstone said

  no entender repeated the mexican he
leaned over as though to pick up another
chunk of wood and from somewhere-
tombstone never did know where-a throw-
ing-knife appeared in his right hand

as swift as the striking of a rattler
the mexican threw that wicked-look-
ing knife but the mexican was no quicker
than the long lean cowboy who went to his
haunches so quickly that the knife flashed
over his left shoulder the metal guard jerk-
ing at his shirt

  the next moment tombstone dived ahead
circling the lean waist of the mexican with
his long powerful arms the knife-thrower
yelped once as tombstone came up in a
swing one complete turn a release and
the man crashed against the comer of the
house a dozen feet away

  tombstone went to one knee but was up
in a flash his gun out covering the doorway
but no one came gradually the tall cow-

western

boy relaxed stepped over and looked at the
knife expert who would not be throwing
knives for a long time then he went
gingerly into the old adobe ranchhouse

  the place was dirty and didnt smell too
well dirt floors cobwebby walls and ceil-
ings the main room was foggy from a
smoldering fire in the fireplace and on a
crude bunk was a man all tied up with ropes
but not gagged it wasnt speedy tomb-
stone looked him over

  all right you dirty pup the man said
if its money you want say so

  dont we all asked tombstone quietly
who are you

  i am homer g gates the second re-
plied the young man painfully

 howdy homer tombstone grinned
ive heard of you my names jones

  if you are one of topetes gang youre
probably lying

  topetes gang brought yuh here eh
  what do you think

  tombstone sat down on the end of the
bunk and considered the young man homer
the second was fat and pudgy with a gen-
erous waist line pouty mouth and scowling
eyes his hair was mousy-blond he was
the man who had been knocked off his horse
when the buggy was wrecked

  i heard yuh got hurt the other night 
said tombstone

  i got knocked stiff homer said soberly 
just why did they tie yuh up and bring 
yuh here homer

  you ask them-i never had a chance i i
dont know why whats your part in this
deal jones-if that is your name

  im lookin for my pardner speedy
smith they got him too

  are you going to let me loose homer i
asked anxiously

  tombstone untied him homer sat up and j
flexed his muscles-what he had for most of
him was fat

  we better be movin homer tomb-
stone said theyll be cornin back

  homer was willing enough to move when
they went outside he stared at the mexican
at the comer of the house

  dead he whispered anxiously

  just sleepin replied tombstone

  they went down to the corral where the
horses milled around

  weve got to get us some rollin stock
homer declared tombstone i dont
reckon yore dad would mind if i rode one of
his hosses

  you mean those are dads horses ex-
claimed homer
trail of the flame



  if they aint topete is raisin some awful
 good broncs

  there were two fairly good saddles in the
 stable and it was no effort for tombstone
 to rope a tall sorrel out of the herd he
 cinched on the saddle fashioned a rope
 hackamore and led the animal down to
 where his own horse was hidden

 yuh better ride my hoss homer he
said yuh cant tell what thisn might do
were goin to cut them hosses loose and
head em toward verde vista i dont reckon
well ever get em out of mexico but well
give the boys the job of gettin em back
all here

  the tall sorrel didnt want to buck but he
 did want to run and tombstone had some
 difficulty getting the animal convinced that
 speed at this time was not necessary how-
 ever he managed to open the sagging old
 gate and send the herd into headlong flight
 up the road

  reining his horse in beside homer tomb-
stone said

  where-at was slim cantrell while you
was gettin captured

  they got him first replied homer-

  tombstone cuffed his old hat over one eye
 and stared straight ahead

  why he asked

  they didnt tell me

  was they goin to hold yuh for ransom
homer

  ransom you mean ask my dad to pay to
get me back

  somethin like that he would wouldnt
he homer

  homer thought it over carefully before he
 replied

  my dad is a hard-headed business man
jones he said then he wants value re-
ceived in any deal no i dont believe hed
pay

  well he knows yuh better than i do

 said tombstone drily   

in the meantime speedy smith was not
enjoying life at all he had a cut scalp
and an egg-sized lump on his head which
made him dizzy from the pain he was also
tied hand and foot on a bunk

  speedy didnt remember exactly what had
happened to him and he had no idea where
he was thinking only made his head ache
several times he had a hazy remembrance
that men had questioned him but he couldnt
remember what it was that they had wanted
to know

  there was one window rather high on
the wall opposite the bunk on which he lay
but it was covered so that little light came
through but the time of day meant nothing
anyhow

  his head was clearing a little when two
men came in locking the door behind them
speedy never had seen them before one
was a squat mustached mexican gaudy
with colors and silver the other was a
chinese nattily dressed but not at all pleas-
ant looking

  he had agate eyes and he spoke english
with only a little accent

  you are able to talk eh he questioned
that is good

  speedy looked the men over through nar-
rowed eyes

   he didnt feel like talking

  we wish to ask you a question said the
chinese

  stop wishin said speedy angrily
yuhve got me where i cant help myself
so why wish

  the chinese smiled but it was not a pleas-
ant smile

  i understand that you and your com-
panion came to turquoise city in a buggy
he said

turn page

tired kidneys often
      bring sleepless nights

  doctors say your kidneys contain  miles of
tiny tubes or filters which help to purify the
blood and keep you healthy when they get
tired and dont work right in the daytime
many people have to get up nights frequent
or scanty passages with smarting and burning
sometimes shows there is something wrong
with your kidneys or bladder dont neglect
this condition and lose valuable restful sleep

  when disorder of kidney function permits

poisonous matter to remain in your blood it may
also cause nagging backache rheumatic pains
leg pains loss of pep and energy swelling puffi-

lions for over  years doans give happy relief
and will help the  miles of kidney tubes flush

	exciting

  yore understandin is limited to what
folks tell yuh remarked speedy we
didnt do anything of the kind

you are not in any position to lie to me
i aint lyin why would i lie whats
this all about anyway whyd somebody
pop me on the head and bring me here
you didnt come to turquoise city in a
buggy eh

  we shore didnt anybody says we did
lies

 the chinese spoke spanish like a mex-
ican and he told all this to his companion
the mexican listened his eyes hard they
argued for several minutes

  wy don you tell heem wat we want
the mexican finally said

  no snapped the chinese later per-
haps but not now either we have been
doublecrossed or this man is lying we will
find out

  how about some water and a little food
asked speedy

  the chinese laughed at him

  a little hunger a little thirst may make
you tell the truth-later

  they went out then and locked the door
behind them speedy tried to loosen his
hands but they were bound with small
maguey rope that was like steel cable he
finally gave up the effort and went to sleep

chapter v

prisoners and such

anky tombstone and
homer the second were
having little trouble
keeping the loose horses
on the old road the
horses seemed to have a
homing instinct

                     howd it happen that
                   yuh got knocked stiff
                   the other night tomb-
                   stone said to homer

i dont know re-
plied homer i guess i
was pretty drunk and going fast slim said
we hit something but im not sure of any-
thing

  i heard it killed yore hoss

  i heard the same thing tombstone but
im not sure

  it was evident that homer the second did
not know what he had run into and neither
did he say anything about the loss of his
saddle

  the bunch of horses were well strung out

western

along the road traveling at a fairly good
pace the tall sorrel under tombstone seemed
to be walking on air wanting to run some
more but tombstone kept the animal in
check

  well never get this remuda past verde
vista he said our best bet is to circle the
town and head for the border and yore best
bet is to stay home my boy

  im free white and twenty-one de-
clared homer

  and just then the horses all disappeared
around a curve in the road and as tomb-
stone and homer swung around it five armed
men stepped into the road just in front of
them one man flung up his left hand

  alto ahi alto ahi he yelled and tomb-
stone knew enough spanish to know that
meant stop there

  the five men were not over twenty feet
away walking toward them tombstone
swung low over his horses neck cmon
kid he yelled and drove the rowels into
that highbred horse

  it was like releasing an arrow from a bow
the five men had no chance to dodge before
that sorrel crashed into them sending three
of them spinning the other two diving aside
yelling

  the next curve was not over a hundred
yards ahead and tombstone was going
around it swinging out at an angle of forty-
five degrees in order for the horse to keep
its feet when two bullets sang over his head
he looked back to see if homer the second
was following but too late he rode a quar-
ter of a mile further on slowed to a stop
and waited but homer didnt come the
herd of horses was far ahead now throwing
up a cloud of dust as they galloped for
verde vista

  but tombstone was not going to run the
gauntlet of verde vista he swung into the
hills above the town came in past some old
adobe barracks and found a trail about
halfway up the hill heading north after he
passed verde vista he could see the winding
old road below him and those horses surely
heading for the border at breakneck speed
they had evidently gone straight through the
town sticking to the main road

  two cowboys were following them riding
full speed trying to overtake the herd but
those loose horses were not going to let any-
one pass them on that narrow road a few
hundred yards from the old gate at the
border both men drew up and went back

  tombstone shoved his horse down through
the brush to the road and came in behind
the herd the gate was open and four riders
trail of the flame	

 were on the american side one of them
 started to close the gate but changed his
 mind and the horses raced through

 tombstone came galloping through the
 gateway and drew up

 old hack-saw jones hisself one of the
 riders said

 tombstone leaned wearily on his saddle-
 horn and grinned n
 hyah el-mer he said

 homer g gates was one of the riders and
 he was so excited that he could hardly talk

 but i tell you sheriff those are my miss-
 ing horses he yelled coming out of mex-
 ico too you saw them

 yeah admitted dan oleary the sheriff
 eyeing tombstone

 theyre our hosses all right said a cow-
 boy

 now that thats settled sighed tomb-
 stone howdy folks

 gates

 what am i supposed to do-get excited
 asked tombstone ive knowed that ever
 since i was knee-high to a tall injun

 and uncle sam didnt get no duty on
 them hosses said dan oleary

 never mind the duty-ill pay that said
 gates jones where on earth did you find
 my horses

 thats funny i was ridin along the hill and
 i seen em down on the road so i went down
 to the road-and here i am

 omer g gates looked puzzled

 mr gates dan oleary said yuh

 back home

 the idea is not crazy-and i shall not go
 home

 stone

 well yuh see replied elmer hes got a
 son which aint been home for a couple days
 he thinks hes in verde vista so hes goin
 over there and bring him home

 what do you think about it jones
 asked the sheriff

 tombstone looked over the little fat man
 and shook his head

 i dont need your opinion sir snapped
 homer g gates

 then i wont give it to yuh said tomb-
 stone

 sa-a-ay snorted the sheriff you
 wasnt over there packin yore gun in sight
 thataway was yuh jones

 i was lookin for my pardner replied

tombstone quietly somebody knocked him
down in our room last night and packed him
away so i came a-lookin for him i wasnt
worryin about what theyd do about my
gun

  yuh mean somebody knocked speedy
down and took him asked elmer we
didnt know that

  tombstone nodded homer g gates
turned to his cowboy

  johnny he said you take those horses
back to the ranch im going to verde vista
you tell mrs gates that i shall be home
soon

  then the fat man who had more money
than brains rode through the gateway and
headed for verde vista the cowboy shrug-
ged his thin shoulders

  i just work for him he said and reined
around to follow the horses

  dan oleary gestured wearily

  what can yuh do with a feller like him
he asked hes been the boss all his life and
hes still bossin if he wants to go to verde
vista its his business i reckon id like to
know where them hosses come from theyre
his hosses thats a cinch he knew em right
away

  all but one said tombstone soberly
  what do you mean asked the sheriff
  the one im a-ridin

  one of his hosses gasped elmer
whered yuh get that sorrel hoss tomb-
stone

  oh i just borrowed it out of a corral m
mexico elmer

  yea-a-ah one of gates hosses and you

  well replied tombstone soberly once
upon a time there was three little pigs the
mamma pig said to the little-

  where did yuh find them hosses
wee-e-ell i just looked-and there they
was

  jones dan oleary said did yuh see
gates son

spacing his words carefully you took one
of his fathers hosses i see but what be-
came of homer the second

well sir we ran into an ambush five men
blockin the road but this here skittish crit-
ter busted plumb through em probly crip-
plin some of em me and the sorrel got

  dan oleary began enumerating the dif-
	exciting

ferent points on his fingers his eyes squinted
thoughtfully

  yuh found the hosses in mexico gave
yore hoss to homer ran into an ambush
and-

  like i said added tombstone there
was three little pigs

  and the biggest liar that ever came out of
new mexico added elmer

  likely growled the sheriff jones did
yuh see slim cantrell down in verde vista
tombstone shook his head

  i was lookin for speedy yuh know

  we just came down from turquoise
city said elmer and he wasnt there i
asked for yuh at the hotel and old jim
said neither of yuh was there last night
why would anybody kidnap speedy
asked oleary

  well i reckon theyll ask me for some
ransom money

  ask you gasped elmer you aint got
no money

  i aint thats all you know-oh my

tombstone cuffed his hat over one eye
and stared at them

  they kidnaped him for his money he
exclaimed speedy had almost three thou-
sand pinned inside his shirt thats what
they done

  why didnt they just take his shirt
asked elmer

  well yeah they-nope they wouldnt
have to hold him for ransom cause they
could just take that three thousand

  where did he get three thousand dollars
asked the sheriff curiously

  from me replied tombstone i split
six thousand with him

  lets go home elmer said the sheriff
huskily mebbe its the heat-i dont know

stone asked elmer

  no i dont reckon so i just got to thinkin
about homer g gates hes crazy to go

  elmer squinted at dan oleary thought-
fully finally he unpinned his deputy sher-
iffs badge and handed it to the sheriff

western

fully if yuh dont mind dan id kinda like

port- but you go ahead ill be in tur-

  the sheriff turned and rode back toward
turquoise city tombstone watched him for
a while before turning his sorrel around

  what was that he said in spanish
elmer he asked

  vaya con dios that means go with
god 

  huh grunted tombstone thats funny
i never knowed he liked me elmer

chapter vi

the brainy tall one

-r l-fomer g gates went
i i straight to verde vista
j and tied his horse beside
r i la golondrina cantina
j  he had never been in
verde vista before
knew little about the
border towns in general
and did not understand
a word of spanish

  his entrance in to the
cantina caused a decided
silence every eye was
short squat perfectly
groomed man as he walked deliberately up
to the long bar the men looked at each
other but made no remarks the bartender
looked inquiringly at homer g gates

  si senor he said

  i am looking for my son said homer g
gates firmly

your son senor do i know heem

  homer g gates the second said the
father stiffly

  poco topete watching a poker game
heard the name and came up to the bar
topete was all smiles he even bowed

  you look for omer gates he asked i
am topete come-we weel spik quietly
from each other

  homer g gates followed topete over to
the bottom of ths atairs

turned upon the
trail of the flame	

 senor i weesh from talk een private
weeth you topete said the boy he ees
gots leetle beet too mucho vino he ees all
right you onnerstand we weel go opstairs
to heem eh

 i want to see him sir the young fool
needs to be taught a lesson

 they went up the stairs down a narrow
hallway where a mestizo lounged jigainst
the corner topete spoke to him sharply and
the man unlocked a door homer g gates
didnt realize that this man was a guard he
followed topete into the room and the
mestizo came in behind homer g gates
closing and locking the door

  it was a big room originally used for gam-
bling a single lamp was burning at its far
end on the rock mantel of a big fireplace

  there were four people in the room all sit-
ting in chairs but before homer g gates
had any chance to ask a question or really
see who the four men were topete and the
guard grabbed and roped him they hustled
him to an empty chair where they proceed-
ed to tie his feet securely he saw then
that the other four men in chairs were
speedy smith homer g gates the second
slim cantrell and jim brant a cowboy from
gates own ranch the cowboy who had been
with homer and cantrell when they had
run into the buggy

  the elder gates tried to voice a protest
but a dirty rag was shoved between his teeth
and the protest was choked off poco topete
seemed well satisfied but topete wasnt tak-
ing any chances he ordered the guard to
stay in the room and keep the door shut

 then topete went back down into the
cantina to drink a lot of tequila and figure
out just what good homer g gateg might be
to him homer g gates had plenty money
and topete was not adverse to getting mon-
ey no matter how he got it

 he met diamond charley wong in the
cantina and told the chinese what he had
done charley didnt like it smuggling was
one thing kidnaping was something else

 i don keednaps heem charley topete
said he come here heemselves

  a difference without a distinction said
charley you are a fool topete too many
mistakes have been made now gates is a
very rich and influential man you have a
good business here now but a foolish move
like that might ruin everything

 por dios i can turn heem loose now
charley he know too much

  thats true your job is to watch out for
smiths partner-the tall one he took that
fat fool of a kid from the ranch along with

the horses he will know all the kid knows-
and that tall one is not a prisoner

  bah snorted topete he come here

fully

  good if they want to live they will not
lie  

tombstone jones and elmer higgins
rode back into mexico without the
slightest idea where to go nor what to do
they sat their horses in the brush on the
hill slope above the town and debated their
moves they also wanted to watch and see if
homer g gates went back to the border

  after watching for an hour tombstone
said

  im scared he aint cornin out of there
elmer

  after what yuhve told me i aint
amazed replied elmer but all this cap-
turin dont make sense tombstone speedy
aint done nothin to be captured for and
why would they capture slim cantrell and
homer the second topete aint never been
noted for his brains but this here deal looks
loco

  and now theyve got homers pa added
tombstone

  it shore looks like it now what do we
do tombstone

  i dont know el-mer drawled tomb-
stone helplessly weve got to use brains in
this deal

  if thats true we better both go back
home

 ill tell yuh what well do said tomb-
stone lets ride down to that rancho
mebbe they took homer the second back
there

  well id like to save somebody that was
worth while but weve got to do somethin
go ahead-ill trail yuh

  they struck the road south of verde vista
	exciting

and headed for the ranch tombstone showed
elmer where he had made his getaway past
the men they rode on to the ranch and cir-
cled it carefully but saw no signs of life and
finally rode in close to the house

  no one answered their hail so they dis-
mounted stalked to the door and shoved it
open and went in guns ready in the main
room lying on the bunk where tombstone
found homer the second was the mestizo
whom tombstone had pitched against the
house he was wrapped in a blanket reek-
ing of horse liniment tombstone shook him
and he blinked at them grunted and went
back to sleep

  yuh must have bounced him awful hard
remarked elmer

  i didnt hold back if thats what yuh
mean he almost got me with his knife

  they searched the place but the mestizo
was the only inhabitant

  a search of the larder disclosed a hunk of
roasted meat a few cans of beans and some
elderly tortillas they took most everything
in sight and retired to the brush to eat and
watch the place as tombstone explained
we aint got no business in verde vista
in the daytime and this is as good a place to
set as any other

  and what do we do there after dark
asked elmer

  use our brains

  both of us

  better let me do the thinkin said
tombstone im awful good at gettin a idea
once in a while

  like havin a hack-saw blade sewed into
yore chaps eh

  that was a good one chuckled tomb-
stone

  still wearin one

  not since i turned law-abidin el-mer
they watched the place until dark but no
one came so they mounted their horses and
headed for verde vista it was about eight
oclock when they had hidden their horses
and worked their way to a strategic place on
the main street there seemed to be quite
a lot of activity in la golondrina but they
were a little afraid to go into the place

  if we get caught said tombstone
wont be nobody left to help anybody if
speedys in that blasted dump ill get him
out-some way

  yeah agreed elmer dubiously yuh
might do yuh notice theres a feller in front
of the cantina and one over by the hitch-
rack they aint moved none since we came
here theyre guards

  guardin what

western

  theyre posted out there to see that we
dont get in

  well wouldnt that hold a post-mortem
on a polecat exclaimed tombstone im-
agine the nerve of them jaspers yuhd think
we had smallpox or somethin its a free
country aint it el-mer

  nope-this is part of mexico it may be
free to mexicans but not to a feller from
over the border

  yea-a-a-ah thats right breathed
tombstone cmon we cant do no good
here

  they circled around the town crossed the
street about two blocks below the cantina
where there were no lights and came around
to the rear of the cantina where tombstone
had seen them put homer the second on a
horse from the rear corner they could see
the long hitch-rack well filled with horses
but the guard was not visible

there were three windows on the sec-
ond floor and as they started to work
their way along the old adobe wall they
heard a scraping sound above them tomb-
stone jerked upright looking up in the
darkness he could see a man sliding out of a
window swinging down at full arms-length

  tombstone shoved elmer ahead and leaped
back just as the man hit the ground the
man landed on his feet face to the wall but
went backward on the seat of his pants
emitting a decided woosh as the wind left
his lungs

  the man was not knocked out but he was
badly dazed as he tried to get back on his
feet tombstone grabbed him by the arm
but the man suddenly jerked away and
started running back toward the old stable
neither tombstone nor elmer knew what
was just the right thing to do for the mo-
ment but tombstone took after the fellow

  the man reached the angle between the
stable and an old corral where he was
trapped and as tombstone closed in the
man flung something at him tombstone
ducked quickly and came ahead

  the man was all out of fight

  all right he choked go ahead a lot
of good it will do you

  just calm down pardner advised tomb-
stone as elmer joined them

  i was scared he might use a gun elmer
said

  if i only had one panted the man

  theres a lantern lit in the stable and
the doors open elmer said

  they took the man into the old stable and
looked him over he waa well dressed ap-
trail of the flame

parently from north of the border and his
face was pale he stared at them as though
trying to place them

  you-youre not one of-not of topetes
gang he asked

  tombstone shook his head

  we just about aint mister were here to
find my pardner his names speedy smith
speedy smith eh youre jones

  that seems to be the general opinion
have yuh seen speedy

  i know where he is jones ill make a
trade with you ill tell you where he is if
youll let me go if they catch me theyll kill
me

  i aint tradin mister if yuh know where
my pardner is yuhll tell trade or no trade
topete and his gang aint the only ones who
can kill

chapter vii

doublecross

taring at the long lean
face of tombstone
jones the narrowed
eyes and long thin-
lipped mouth the man
who had escaped from
the cantina decided that
this was no time to
trade elmer took a sec-
tion of thin rope from a
peg against the wall and
handed it to tombstone
tie him tight ad-
vised elmer ill watch him and the door
why should i keep my mouth shut
asked the man i dont know what you are
going to do with me but i-i dont owe
topete and the others anything

  yuhre gettin smarter every few min-
utes said tombstone now where is my
pardner

  hes upstairs in the cantinareplied the
man hes a prisoner along with slim
cantrell and another man i was a prisoner
too in a single room but i bribed the guard
to go outside and lock the door they thought
i drank doped tequila-the fools if it hadnt
been for you two id have made a getaway
upstairs in the cantina eh growled
tombstone just where

  you saw the window i came from next
to that is a big room where they used to
have the gambling concessions

  how can we get up there

  you cant topete has the place guarded
outside and inside my guard had to go



down and get the guard away from the
hitch-rack before i could jump it cost me
fifty pesos

  yuhre a big help to our family said
tombstone no way to get up there huh
only through the cantina-and two men
cant make it

  did they capture homer g gates asked
elmer

  homer g gates the millionaire not
that i know of they have his son

  they got him today some time

  that i--issible-theyll do anything
topete is an ignorant killer and charley
wong is as cold as a rattler

  what about the roof asked elmer

  the man squinted thoughtfully

  at the far end of the big room is a trap-
 door in the roof he said finally it may be
 nailed down or fastened from the inside
 there is none in the ceiling of the room i
 was in i doubt if you can get in but it is
 worth a try

  well try her said tombstone and
yuh better pray that trap doorll open cause
if we dont win this hand yuhre in an awful
fix

  they went outside and crossed to the low
wing of the cantina peering around the
comer they were able to see the hitch-rack
guard back on the job again

  hack-saw old boy elmer said quietly
if we dont come out of this alive itll be
the first time i ever risked my life and didnt
know what i was doin it for

  all i know is that my pardners up
there said tombstone if yuhre dyin for
information as to why stay down here and
try to find out me im gettin him first-
askin afterwards

  suits me said elmer yukre higher
than i am you boost me up and ili give yuh
a hand from above

  a few moments later the two of them
sprawled on the ancient hand-made tiles
which were like a mass of slide-rock they
had to climb up to the main part of the
cantina then work their way along the ridge
to where they might find the trap-door

  if yuh slip warned elmer yuhll just
sleigh-ride off the roof i never knowed
there was this much loose tile on earth go
ahead tombstone ill be right with yuh
suddenly the lights of the cantina went
out and they could hear men going out of
the place there were some discussions and
arguments at the hitch-rack before the men
rode away tombstone and elmer sprawled
full length on the old tiles wondering what
it was all about finally all was quiet again


and they resumed their careful crawl over
the loose and uneven tiled roof   

but though the cantina had closed
things were going on in that old gam-
bling room just under the roof the five pris-
oners were still tied up helpless to move
charley wong was there now along with
topete who swaggered up and down the
room reeking of tequila and garlic two of
the guards stood just inside the locked door
carrying rifles

  a fire had been built in the huge fireplace
and the flickering light made shadows along
the rough walls there was one lamp on the
long table speedy watched topete

  if yuh had a spreadin tail yuhd look like
a peacock he remarked

  the rest of the prisoners didnt see any
humor in the situation and topete didnt un-
derstand it charley wong picked up an iron
rod about the size of a pencil and three feet
long which he took to the fireplace and
placed one end in the coals

  looks like he might be goin to maverick
somebody observed speedy

  shut up slim cantrell said nervously

  yuhre in a swell position to give orders
cantrell

  no use makin it worsen it already is

  homer the first homer the second-and
who comes third said speedy

  do you think this is funny smith asked
charley wong

  might as well laugh said speedy after
all i dont know what this is all about
somebody tries to knock my head off packs
me down here and keeps me a prisoner and
never tells me why ill keep on laughin till
i know moren i do now

  i know nothing said homer g gates
huskily

  ill say you dont agreed homer the
second why didnt you stay home where
you were safe

  pick up yore loop advised speedy
after all hes yore pa

  i wanted to find you homer said his fa-
ther your mother and sister are worried
about you the border officers came to your
mother and asked her to try and keep you
away from here you know you have been
in bad company

  meanin me i reckon said slim cantrell

  i am beginning to think so said homer
g gates

  charley wong had been listening with a
certain amusement but now he walked over
and stood in front of them

  as far as that goes he said quietly

 homer the second has beenin bad com-
 pany he has unwittingly been the carrier of
 a lot of contraband but that is all past now
 what demanded homer g gates do
 you mean that my own son-

   unwittingly i said reminded wong
 slim cantrell is one of the gang but it
 seems that his usefulness has ended i am
 afraid that mr cantrell has doublecrossed
 his companions in crime

   thats a lie snapped slim i never
 done it charley

   you and mr stone

   if stone told yuh-wheres stone ill
 cram his lies down his throat

   charley wong smiled

   mr stone is investigating i believe you
 see he has thirty thousand dollars in the
 pot and you have only the thirty head of
 horses you turned over to topete

   homer g gates turned his head and
 looked at slim but slim did not look at
 homer g gates

   i will admit that you were tempted mr
 cantrell charley wong said but your
 story is too thin i believe you will soon tell
 the truth

   whats this stuff all about asked speedy
 yuhre accusin everybody of bein a dou-
  blecrosser but yuh dont say why nobody
 has asked me anything except did i come to
 turquoise city in a buggy since when was
 it a crime to ride in a buggy

   charley wong turned from slim cantrell
 and stepped over in front of speedy

   so you did come to turquoise city in a
 buggy eh he snarled

   nope replied speedy firmly we
 walked in

   oh you walked- wait a minute you
 walked in when your buggy was smashed
 am i right

   yuhre right-for once in yore life
 whats next

   did you steal the saddle off that dead
 horse asked slim

   speedy took that question under advise-
 ment no one could prove that they did it
 emed he scowled at slim

   what saddle he asked blandly

   slim took a deep breath and shook his
 head charley smiled topete asked a ques-
 tion in spanish charley scowled but finally
 shook his head

   have one of the guards bring stone he
 said

   topete gave the order and one of the
 guards left the room

   so yuh had stone tied up too eh
 growled slim

exciting western

                       
 trail of the flame

  i am not taking any chances replied the
chinese

the door banged open and the guard
rushed in talking explosively in span-
ish

 gone charley rasped how could he
get away topete where were your guards
topete rushed out of the room cursing in
spanish slim laughed

 what is funny about it demanded
charley hotly

  there goes yore diamond charley
  what do you mean

  stones gone if he didnt have the dia-
mond why would he try to get away hes
got thirty thousand in the pot have a little
sense

  he hasnt that diamond denied the chi-
nese i was there when that old saddle-
maker sewed it into the saddle

so was stone slim said seriously its
a dollar against a doughnut that he switched
stones on yuh charley stones gone
speedy laughed shortly but his mirth was
short-lived the chinese whirled on him

  you got that saddle he rasped you
know where it is

  do i countered speedy so yuh sewed
a diamond into a saddle and sent it across
with homer the second makin a smuggler
out of a dumb kid then yuh lost saddle and
all serves yuh right

 charley leaned in and shoved one hand
against speedys shoulder looking him
squarely in the eye

 where did you hide that saddle he
asked

  speedys feet were tied together but not
tied to the chair and when charley leaned
in close speedy kicked him on the shins with
both boot-heels it almost caused charley to
cry out he staggered back caught his bal-
ance against the table just as topete came in

  stone ees gone-vamoso he exclaimed
those guard ees gone madre de dios
everytheeng happen

  and just then as though to add to the
confusion a three-foot section of the plas-
tered ceiling let loose and landed squarely on
topetes head knocking him to the floor in a
shower of plaster flakes

  most everything happens said speedy
drily

  topete got up gun in hand his hat driven
down until his eyes were not visible

 who heet me he demanded who
heet me i keel sometheeng

  topete had started ahead clawing at his
hat when homer the second shoved out his



bound feet and topete fell over them his
gun spun along the floor almost to the fire-
place

  set em up in the other alley whooped

speedy

  topete got to his feet yanked his hat
loose and picked up his gun topete was
mad humiliated dangerous

  basta charley said

  topete started a rapid-fire of spanish bat
charley stopped him

  this has gone far enough he declared
smith you will tell us where you left that
saddle

  yuhre just guessin i will speedy
grinned

  this is not a guess my friend said
charxv i am not in the habit of joking
about a fortune that saddle contains the
flame of the temple which cost me every
cent i have made in years diamond charley
wong does not go broke-easily will you
tell where that saddle is or do i have to force
you to tell

  i cant tell yuh where it is speedy said
soberly because i hid it in a mesquite
thicket id have to take yuh there

  i think you lie smith in fact i think
that so strongly that i shall make you v
the truth

chapter vih

no contraband-no nothin

harley wong walked
over to the fireplace and
picked up the iron rod
glowing red for about
three inches on the end
all eyes were on the
evil-faced oriental as
he carefully examined
the red-hot point

  there have been too
many lies he said
harshly some of you
are going to tell the
truth at once because one touch of that point
will ruin an eye

  geeve eet to heem exclaimed topete
rubbing his sore head

  charley wong came back from the fire-
place carrying the heated rod and stopped
in front of speedy there wes no question in
the mind of the little cowboy that wong des-
perate now would carry out his threat
something had to be done

  all right charley-i lied speedy said
the saddle is in the storeroom of the astor
	exciting western

hotel in turquoise city

  charley wong lowered the point as he
stared at speedy

  in the storeroom at the hotel eh no no
my friend that is a he to save your eyes
perhaps if i just bum a little design on your
forehead you will remember the truth like
this-topete hold his head he is nervous
si si i weel hoi heem

  topete had started to circle speedys chair
when more plaster came down both charley
and topete jerked back and looked at the
ceiling where a whole section was breaking
through topete yelled and tried to get away
and the next moment roof plaster rotten
laths heavy clumsy old tiles came down like
an avalanche and on top of them came
tombstone jones and elmer higgins kick-
ing grabbing yelping

  the crash shook the whole cantina
smashed the table on which the lamp stood
plunging the whole place into darkness
more tiles loosened by the break-through
cascaded down into the room and the room
was foggy with plaster dust

  speedy had a flash of the avalanche
  tombstone he yelled

  a six-shooter flashed in the dark madre
de dios-the door topete howled

  wham a sixshooter blasted from down
along the floor and a man cried out sharply

  settin on my hands and thought i was
tied down elmer higgins complained

  dont light a match warned speedy
theres charley wong and topete and two
guards theyre armed boys

  im glad to hear from yuh speedy said
tombstone

  yuh can put a ps on that from me
pardner look out for the--two rattlers
heres somebody said elmer i reckon
he stopped a tile

  get set el-mer whispered tombstone
im lightin a match

  let er rip hack-saw

  tombstone lighted the match holding it as
far from his body as possible but nobody
shot at it charley wong was stretched out
on the floor a heavy tile leaning against his
face the door was wide open and topete
was piled up just short of it

  there were some candles on the mantel-
piece and tombstone soon had the place
partly illuminated he and elmer swiftly cut
the prisoners loose all except slim cantrell
homer the second vetoed that

  slim dont deserve anything he said
he stole those horses tombstone

  all right-he stays he rest of us better
get goin how are yuh speedy

  oh ill be alive by momin i reckon
how are yuh elmer

  there aint a inch of me that aint skinned
speedy me and old hack-saw have crawled
all over that blasted roof lookin for that
there trap-door up there but we didnt
find it

  we made our own hole the bruised
tombstone grinned he had a discolored eye
a swelled cheek and a cut lip

  this here chinese aint goin no place
said elmer

  neither is topete said speedy some-
body got him dead center lets start movin
before any of the gang come back

  homer g gates didnt know what it was
all about he seemed like a disinterested
spectator and they fairly had to shove him
out into the dark hallway

  you are jones he did say to tombstone 
its really surprisin replied tombstone
but its a fact

  they went down through the cantina
kicked the door loose and went into the
street no one opposed them verde vista
was quiet perhaps the inhabitants had sense
enough to stay indoors when trouble broke
loose at la golondrina

there were three horses in the stable
two of them belonging to homer the
second and his father a hoss for every-
body except jim brant elmer said

  dont worry about him said tombstone
he pulled out as soon as we got out of the
cantina he was slims little helper

 do you mean he helped slim steal
horses asked homer the second

  wasnt he with you and slim when yuh
ran into our buggy

  thats right

  cross his name off the list cmon el-
mer well get our hosses and mi stone can
ride double with me

  stone queried speedy where-at is
stone

  hes tied up back there i want him to
identify that diamond we heard yuh talkin
about a while ago

  no one opposed the cavalcade as it headed
north until the riders got to the border
where three of the border patrol blocked
them al stevens recognized homer the
second who tried to explain what had hap-
pened but tombstone moved in

  officer he said most of this outfit are
fugitives from a diamond up near tur-
quoise city is a saddle hangin in a mesquite
thicket and that big diamond is supposed to
be sewed into the fork of the saddle while
trail of the flame	

were travelin up that way well try and ex-
plain how it got there

  the flame of the temple asked stev-
ens

 things do get around said speedy
weve got mr stone with us but he dont
want to discuss it if i was short thirty thou-
sand dollars id quit talkin too

  what do yuh think the thing is worth
asked one of the officers as they rode north

  hundred thousand dollars i reckon es-
timated speedy

  well if it is you can be awful happy
said stevens yuhll get twenty-five per
cent  

  they found the saddle turned it over to
the officers and went on to turquoise city
as they entered the astor house old jim
shane arose from behind his desk and stared
over his glasses at them

  his eyes shifted from one to the other as
he seemed to be making a mental count the
three officers had the saddle in the middle of
the floor and were cutting the leather loose
from the fork stone was sitting in a chair
looking sick over it all
al stevens emitted a decided ah-
ha-a-a and came up with an object tightly
wrapped in soft leather

  he took it over to the better light at the
desk and the others crowded in close as he
unwrapped it the object tumbled out of its
wrappings and they all leaned forward
staring at it stevens poked at it

  flame of the temple he snorted thats
nothin but a hunk of glass

 they all relaxed tombstone went over
to stone who grinned sickly

 yuh tried to doublecross everybody
huh queried tombstone

  why not asked stone wearily they
were all crooks

 al stevens walked over to stone and
looked down at him

  all right stone he said harshly where
is that big diamond

  stone smiled slowly you cant touch
me he said im in the clear ask tomb-
stone jones where the diamond is

  ask me snorted tombstone howd i
know

 when you boys caught me after i
dropped out of that window i thought you
were some of topetes gang i didnt dare
have that diamond found on me and in des-
peration i threw it at you when you cor-
nered me between the corral fence and the
stable

   al stevens swore softly v as his two men
quickly searched stone but found nothing
the man was evidently telling the truth
there was a commotion at the doorway and
in came mrs gates and her daughter

  homer g gates had been merely standing
around dumbly still not seeming quite to un-
derstand what this was all about mrs gates
grabbed him with both hands her eyes wide

  homer she exclaimed homerwhere
have you been

  why-why my dear he said huskily i
-i    well i have been with jones its all
right it wasnt a real diamond after all

homer the second put his arm around
his sister its all right he repeated
everything is all right well go back home
and i will explain everything come mother
-you and dad

  the four of them walked out

   well boys i reckon thats that stevens
said no contraband no prisoners-nothin
good night

  the three officers walked out leaving
stone in his chair tombstone speedy and
elmer higgins against the hotel desk

   well it was a wonderful night anyway
speedy said even if we didnt get the re-
ward but money aint everything

  tombstone had been staring thoughtfully
and he suddenly grabbed speedy by the arm

  yore money he exclaimed yuh had
yore money with yuh

  money asked speedy blankly

  yore share of the three thousand they
robbed yuh of it thats why yuh never have
anything yuhve done lost yore half
wait a minute snorted speedy i didnt
either our money was all in that valise
upstairs

   tombstones jaw dropped as he visualized
the emptied valises weve been robbed-
both of us he choked no money

  they was a telegram come for you
jones said old jim here she is

   you read it speedy im too upset

   its from jim keaton and he says ignore
last wire to wait for man to contact you he
saw you and decided to handle the job him-
self you should be broke by this time wire

yuh told him to stop mind-readin and
get a crystal ball them things shore work

not by the rope

the voice came out of the mountain
silence just as navajo tom raine
arizona ranger topped a tall ridge
raine was already pulling back on his reins
intending to halt his magnificent blue roan
gelding wampum for a breather but he
halted more abruptly than he had meant to
when he heard that voice somewhere behind
hinj-

  dont look around tom the voice
came again make out that theres somethin
wrong with your cinches listen to what
tve got to say but dont let on anybodys

talkin to yuh because yuhre bein watch-
ed

  raine was alert but not alarmed obvi-
ously the hidden speaker meant him no
harm since the fellow could have sent a
bullet into his back instead of calling out to
him he leaned sideward from the saddle
pretending to be studying his latigo strap
then swung down to the stony earth

  on or off a horse navajo tom raine was
a striking figure tall and long-limbed he
had the flat stomach and lean hips of a man
who spent much time in the saddle his chest
was deep his shoulders broad and square
his features were hawkish lean-cheeked
and dark and his heavy black hair hung

navajo raine rides into little pine ready


lobo legion jackson cole

navajo indian fashion almost to his shoul-
ders

 the matched colt s that swung against
the rangers thighs in pliant holsters had
turquoise-mounted grips and a band of
hand-hammered silver ornaments set with
matched turquoise stones circled the crown
of his black stetson

 yet despite his long hair and navajo
trappings there was no indian blood in raine
his eyes slightly narrowed now as they
searched the crooked bushy ridge about him
without appearing to do so told that for
they were calm and green-the bright alert
eyes of a man accustomed to rubbing elbows
with danger

haine looped the left stirrup of his
saddle over the saddle-horn and loos-
ened the latigo strap head bent as if nothing
else interested him

 thanks for playin along tom the
hidden man spoke again his voice was thin
raw-edged from nervous strain there was
desperation in that voice too as he went on
ive been watchin this trail four days
knowin an arizona territorial ranger would
be cornin along im shore glad they sent
you because mebbe yuhll help me yuh
figgered me out yet tom

  yuh sound a heap like a little rooster i
knew when we were gangly kids raine
smiled faintly he was an ornery little

for a gun showdown with lynching hombres


	exciting

squirt who nibbled moonshine whisky used
cuss words he didnt even understand and
bragged that hed be the toughest slickest
buscadero in arizona when he growed up
his name was sime benge last i heard
of him he was supposed to be a member of
ike siscos lobo legion

  yuh couldnt prove that this sime benge
gent belonged to siscos bunch could yuh
tom the thin voice asked tensely

  i couldnt prove it raine admitted busy
with tiie latigo strap so if thats whats
wartin yuh sime forget it ike sisco scat-
tered his men and went out of the bandit
business when the rangers got on his trail
a couple of years back ike headed for the
border but a couple of rangers caught that
big tow-headed yellow-eyed hellion this
side of nogales and had to kill him as long
as siscos lobos dont try to operate again
the rangers will let em alone

  yuhve taken a load off my mind by tellin
me that tom sime benge said wearily
but ill have to have yore help or some-
thinll happen to me

  what raine asked

  the same thing that happened to them
three gents who was found hangin to that
bull pine on the south rim of cemetery hill
at little pine sime benge said grimly
yuhve been sent here to investigate them
lynchins tom only they wasnt lynchins
because each one of them fellers was dead
before he was ever left danglin on a rope
what in blazes yuh talkin about raine
said diarply

 yuh did come here to look into them
three deaths didnt you sime benge
countered

  yeah raine admitted burt mossman
-hes the captain and the organizer of the
rangers-heard that three men had been
mysteriously lynched at little pine and
that the sheriff hadnt made any arrests
so he sent me to look into them deaths
now whats this about the three men bein
dead before they were hanged sime

  its the truth tom benge insisted i
seen the bodies of them three men-bart
murphy roy fleer and ott shope they
got hung about eight or ten days apart
bart first ray second and ott last i seen
each body while it was still danglin to that
bull pine on cemetery hill and i sneaked
into elmer grants undertakin parlor to
look at em after they was laid out

  how had they been killed if not by hang-
in sime raine wanted to know

  a thin cord or jnebbe a wire had been
used to coke em to death benge said

western

gravely ive been a feller or two strung
up in my time and knowed somethin was
wrong somewhere when i seen bart murphy
hangin from that bull pine his neck wasnt
broke and the rope hadnt cut into his skin
like it would if he had been hung by it
so yuh decided to do a little investigatra
did you asked raine

  i seen a thin crease around murphys
skinny neck that no half-inch rope like he
was hung with could have made benge
informed so i slipped into the funeral
parlor that night for a better look the mark
was there all right thin and deep only
the skin had been scraped over it till it was
mighty hard to see it and it was the same
with roy fleer and ott shope tom theyd
been choked to death most likely with a
piece of wire then hung after they was
dead

yuh knew the three men who were kill-
ed raine asked

  id knowed em a long time benge ad-
mitted but now there was caution in his
voice

the rangers interest sharpened and his
lips tightened a little as he guessed at
the significance of benges sudden reserve
but the rangers hawkish features showed
no change of expression

 who did the three men work for and
who were their cronies he asked quietly

  each one of em worked for his ownself
benge told him murphy owned a farm
out in watchin man valley fleer owned
a feed store in little pine and shope run a
blacksmith shop in town

  and somebody choked em to death with
a wire or cord the way you figger it eh
thats the size of it sime benge said
nervously and unless i read the sign
wrong tom im due to be the next gent
found hangin to that bull pine on cemetery
hill or mebbe a little pine merchant by
the name of vance lang will be next itll
be one of us

 why do yuh think so raine asked
sharply

 because were the only two men left
alive who own watchin man valley land
that eric kells rockin k cattle dont graze
benge said fiercely kell owns two-thirds
of the valley and still he aint satisfied him
and that skull-faced blake newton he got
elected sheriff are workin hand-in-glove to
wipe out all us small owners in the valley
the sneakin sons got bart and roy and
ott so-

  hold on a minute raine cut into the
loot of the lobo legion

angry flow of words yuh say bart murphy
had a farm in watchin man valley did
the other two men own land there too
they shore did sime benge gritted
and unless you help me tom ill get what
they got

 how do yuh figger i can help yuh
raine asked

  get the goods on eric kell and blake
newton benge said thinly you jail that
pair and my worries are over

  so yuh think eric kell and the sheriff
are behind the killins raine said thought-
fully is that just yore guess or have yuh
got proof to back it up sime

  nobody but kell would have any reason
for wantin us small owners in the valley out
of the way benge declared and added
hurriedly yuhve dallied here about as
long as yuh dare tom i glimpsed a rider
on the ridge before yuh come along i think
hes still there in a stand of young pine
watchin yuh

  where can i find yuh to hear the rest of
whats on yore mind raine asked drily

 so yuh think im runnin a sandy on
yuh eh benge snorted all right let it
pass for now lope on into little pine
tom and put up at the cattlemans hotel
anse bishop who rims the place is my
friend hell tell me which room yuhre in
and ill be there at midnight

  fair enough raine agreed but sime
fd like to find out how yuh knew a ranger
was cornin in here

  shucks its all over little pine -benge
retorted sheriff newtons fit to be tied and
swears hell gun any ranger who comes
here and tries to make it look like he aint
done his job watch that fish-eyed son
when yuh hit town or-steady tom act
natural but hit that saddle and move on
the hellion on the ridge is standin by a rock
now watchin yuh

i dont stampede easy raine chuckled
so yuh think im lying benge rapped
out just glance up the ridge by that big
sharp-topped boulder-and get yore first
sight of sheriff blake newton

  raine looked along the ridge and as he
lifted his head a tall thin man who wore a
red shirt and an almost white stetson dodged
hastily behind a sharp-domed boulder raine
went up into wampums saddle his green
eyes hard now

 sorry i doubted yuh sime he said
grimly meet me at the hotel tonight and
ill be glad to hear what else yuh know
about this killer mixup

  ill meet yuh if yuh live to get there



sime benge jeered that squinch-eyed
sheriff knows yuh saw him or he wouldnt
have skinned around that rock so fast and
hes liable to slap yuh between the shoulder-
blades with a bullet before yuh ever see
little pine

chapter n

three visitors

avajo tom raine
was in room eighteen
at the cattlemans hotel
looking out and down on
little pines broad clean
street his gregn eyes
twinkled with amuse-
ment as they followed
the stocky figure of the
man who already had
been pointed out to him
as vance lang hurrying
along the boardwalk
coming toward the hotel

  lang had just come from langs mercan-
tile the largest and best stocked establish-
ment of its kind in the town he was tugging
a narrow-brimmed hat down over a shock
of thick graying hair with an angry gesture
and there was anger in his bouncing stride
too

  raine heard the faint bang of double
screen doors as lang came into the lobby
downstairs then langs feet were on the
stairs pounding furiously up to the second-
story hallway and the next minute he was
hammering on the rangers door

  come in raine called and stopped
smiling when the door flew open then was
slammed shut behind vance lang with a
violence that shook the room

  lang halted on short thick legs that were
spread wide shoved his hat to the back of
his head and put a clenched fist on each hip
he stood with head thrust forward above
blocky shoulders glaring at navajo tom
raine out of eyes that were as black and
shiny as polished onyx

  yuhve been in this town three hours
raine wanderin around like a lost duck
instead of reportin to i e lang accused
his voice shaking with fury

  i stabled my wampum hoss and looked
the town over raine said quietly but
who are you and what give yuh a notion i
was supposed to report to yuh

  langs face turned fiery red as he dropped
his fists from his hips and strode forward
but he halted abruptly warned by some-


	exciting

thing in the face and slowly narrowing
green eyes of the tall ranger

  you know who i am confound yuh
lang choked i seen yuh cut them green
eyes at me every time yuh passed my store

i even motioned for you to step inside but-
langs voice ended on a growling note of
surprise as tom raine strode forward one
long arm shooting out to snatch the hat
from langs head he handed the headgear
to its owner and motioned toward a chair

  sit down and behave yoreself or get out
of here lang he said in a calm voice

  lang did not sit down but the anger
drained out of him as he stared into the cold
green eyes that watched him unwinkingly

  yuh dont sem to care whether i tell yuh
about them three lynchins we had out here
or not he said bluntly is that why yuh
didnt report to me raine

  you wrote to burt mossman told him
three men had been mysteriously lynched
here at little pine and that yore sheriff
blake newton didnt seem to be able to
handle the case raine said quietly but
yuh may as well savvy now as any other
time that burt mossman is the only man i
ever report to

  vance lang did not get angry again he
studied the ranger with his shrewd black
eyes and presently a faint smile touched
his thin lips

  so its true aint it he said

  whats true demanded raine

  that you think act and even look more
like an injun than the white man yuh are
lang shrugged but i reckon that aint
hard to understand after yore famous dad
marshal fowler raine was bushwhacked
and killed durin the bloody tonto basin
range war yuh lived with the navajo injuns
till yuh was a grown man

  i was only a younker when my father
was killed raine said gravely the men
who bushwhacked him thought hed told me
their names before he died they meant to
kill me to keep me from talkin but i gave
em the slip and got into the mountains id
have starved to death if the navajos hadnt
taken me in

  thats the way ive heard it lang nod-
ded and i hear yuh was still with them
injuns makin good money as a mustanger
and hoss raiser when burt mossman asked
yuh to join the rangers

  speakin of captain mossman reminds
me that he sent me here to do a job raine
cut in drily what can yuh tell me about
the three killins raine paced back and
forth while lang toldhis story

western	

vance lang began talking rapidly
telling much the same story sime benge
had told raine but lang made no mention
of thin deep grooves on the necks of the
three victims nor did he suggest that the
men had already been dead when left swing-
ing to the bull pine

  a cunning look came into his black eyes
when he explained that all three men had
owned land in watching man valley a few
miles east of town raine nodded for it was
a valley he knew wefl

  so there yuh are raine vance lang
finished with harsh emphasis murphy
fleer and shope were seized at night drug
up cemetery hill and hung to that big pine
tree me and sime benge are the only two
livin men outside of eric kell who own
land out in the valley benge and metl get
the same thing the other owners did unless
somethins done its up to you to crack
down before we do

  so yuh think eric kell is behind the
deaths of those three men do yuh raine
asked soberly

  who else could it be lang snapped
kell and that gunslingin blake newton he
got elected sheriff are the men yuh want
kell wants all of watchin man valley and
has set out to get it what more do yuh
want

  proof raine said all youve given
me lang is damagin theory which is a
two-edged weapon and danged dangerous
to play with

  abruptly raine took two long strides that
were as soundless as those of a cat his left
hand reached out flipped open the door
vance lang yelped something in a startled
voice but raines green eyes were boring
into two men who stood on his threshold
one was a burly fellow with craggy blunt-
chinned features and hard dark eyes the
other was thin almost as tall as raine and
had cold blue eyes that stared unwinkingly
out of shadowy sockets

  the thin man wore a crimson shirt with
a sheriffs badge pinned to one breast pocket
and held an almost white stetson in one
long bony hand he stood bent almost
double his face on a level with the spot
where the keyhole had been before raine
jerked the door open

  i hope yuh feel as embarrassed as yuh
look sheriff raine chuckled straighten
up man before yuh get a kink in yore back
sheriff blake newton snapped erect his
bony face as red as the shirt he wore he
swallowed and tried to say something but
the words seemed to tick in his throat
loot of the lobo legion

 eric kell what do you and blake newton
j mean by sneakin up on me and tom raine
j thisaway vance langs voice was a sharp
 burst of angry sound

   eric kells craggy face hardened and
 there was fury in the black eyes that stabbed
 toward lang

   me and newton heard enough to know
 yuh was tellin this ranger somethin about
 us he said coldly

   what navajo tom raine and me talked
 about is our business lang snapped

   raine hanged if i know what to say
 after yuhve caught me snoopin like this
 sheriff blake newton declared his voice
 was amazingly deep-toned coming from
 such a thin man

   there aint much yuh can say since this is
 the second time fve caught yuh spyin on
 me today raine said bluntly or did yuh
 know i saw yuh on the trail this afternoon
 all right the sheriff said sourly i was
 spyin on yuh then too and i want to know
 who yuh was talkin to out there raine
 yuhre the only person i saw newton
 the ranger said truthfully enough

   sheriff newtons face went so tight raine
 knew the man was raging angry but some-
 how he held his temper in check

   somebody spoke to yuh while yuh was
 ridin along that trail raine he said slowly
 i seen yuh jerk to attention seen yore hands
 go towards gun butts then yuh relaxed
 got down and started fiddling with yore
 saddle gear mebbe yuh didnt see the feller
 but he was talkin to yuh from the brush
 i know because i rode down and looked
 the sign over after yuh rode on to town
 what in blazes goes on here anyhow
 vance lang yapped yuh didnt tell me
 yuh met somebody out on the trail today
 raine who was it

 raine moved back let kell and the tall
 thin sheriff enter then the ranger
 turned to face all three of the men in the
 room his eyes were hard and bright and
 there was a cold look to his mouth as he eyed
 them silently

    kell he finally said his voice crisp now
  you and newton are in a sweat to know
  what vance lang said about yuh you
  lang are in a dither to find out what newton
  knows about me talkin to somebody before
  i got into town today so suppose you three
  stay in here and have a friendly visit while
  i go see if i can find out who murdered
  three men in this town then hung their dead
  bodies to that big pine on cemetery hill
  raine saw the thunderstruck expressions



on the faces of the three men before him
watched their eyes widen he had slipped
a key from his pockef as he spoke he stuck
the key in the lock of the door stepped
outside yanked the door shut and turned
the key in the lock in a single swift motion
voices within the room roared protest feet
pounded as the three men charged the door
it shuddered as clenched fists and booted
feet hammered on it

  stand aside eric kells voice rumbled
i can blast the lock off this door with one
shot weve got to get raine and find out-

  yuhll find out that bullets can come
through the door from this side too kell
if yuh start shootin navajo tom raine
called sternly

  he was grinning as he tiptoed toward
the stairs he could hear the three trapped
men cursing furiously and knew by the
scraping sound of their boots that they were
getting hastily away from the door

  from below came the sound of a heavy
step the soft squeaking of the stair treads
that would be big fat anse bishop the
hotel owner coming up to see what the
banging and yelling was about raine swung
around tried two doors before he found one
that was unoccupied and unlocked he step-
ped inside it and closed the door gently just
as the crown of bishops bald head showed
above the floor level

  raine moved softly across the room to a
window looked down into a long strip of
dark shadow that was a narrow passage
between the hotel and the adjoining building
he raised the window cautiously then lifted
a heavy rope that was there for use in case of
fire and was neatly coiled on the floor and
fastened to a stout iron ring on the wall

  raine paid out the rope until it touched
the ground then he went over the window
sill and down the strong rope hand over
hand sinking swiftly but silently into the
shadows between the buildings

  striking the earth he stood listening to the
sounds of the town-the far-off barking of
a nervous dog the call of a woman to a
youngster the rattle of a wagon in the main
street no sounds came from inside the hotel
that raine had left but he figured that by
this time the proprietor had opened the
locked room with a pass key

  now for a call on the undertaker the
ranger said to himself softly

  his steps led him toward the main street
where few persons were treading the plank
walks at this hour raine didnt want any
trouble from them he moved swiftly his
eyes alert for danger but he found none

chapter in

the watching man

aine did not like the
attitude of elmer grant
furniture dealer and
lone pines one and
only undertaker grant
a loose-jointed gangly
fellow sat slouched at a
battered desk looking
up at raine out of pale
gray eyes that were set
too close to a long nose

  grants only greeting
was that cold unwink-
ing stare he lifted a bottle of beer drank
noisily and put the bottle back dowh on wr-
desk	s

  all right injun he said finally eitfc
talk or start makin signs what yuh want
in here	

  you know who i am giant raine said
calmly

  well well the undertaker sneered so
yuh think i ought to bow and scrape just
because yuh strut into my store do yuh
raine

  i didnt strut when i came and im not
the kind of hombre who wants people kow-
towin the ranger replied evenly i just
stepped in grant to give yuh a little advice
when i want advice from you or any
other man raine ill ask for it grant
snapped ive got my books to tote up so
unless yuhve got somethin special on yore
mind drag yore freight and leave me be
what i have on my mind is special- and
official raine said bluntly

  elmer grant sat up with a jerk his face
turned red and the pale eyes stared unwink-
ingly at the ranger

  official he echoed what official busi-
ness could yuh have here

  dont try to leave town raine said
coldly

  grants mouth twisted in a sneer but in
his eyes was a flicker of uneasiness he
glanced uncertainly about the cluttered
gloomy furniture store

  ive been in this town ten years he said
harshly what makes yuh think td mebbe
get me a sudden urge to leave

  well go into that when i get back to
town raine said firnjly im goin out to
watchin man valley now and have a look
at some caves me and the injun boys i grew
up with used to know while im gone yuh
better start thinkin up some way to explain

why yuh scraped the skin on the necks of
three dead men to make it look like they
died from hangin instead of bein choked to
death by a cord or thin wire jhich was the
case

  stark terror burned in elmer grants eyes
and from his pallid lips came strange whin-
ing sounds raine walked calmly away but
watched the man over one shoulder

  wait yuh long-haired buzzard grants
voice was a husky whisper

  bui raine paid no attention but went on
outside with a quick stride he kept moving
rapidly until he was past the fumture store
windows

 phew he whistled then he had a
notion hed had a narrow squeak

  a few minutes later the ranger climbed
over the fence of the corral behind the livery
bam where he had left wampum he let
himself in a rear door and was inside the
barn talking quietly to his big roan before
joe seely the stubby shifty-eyed bam
owner spotted him

  hey get away from that hoss seely
yapped

  he skidded to a halt on run-over boot
heels screwed his face into a fierce scowl
and looked raine up and down out of blood-
shot eyes that had a mean glint in them

  yuh aint takin that hoss out of here
raine he said sharply

  raine finished cinching the saddle on
wampum then stepped out of the stall

  i paid in advance when i left wampum
here seely he said levelly why cant i
take him out

  orders seely leered

  orders raine echoed whose orders
seely

  quit givin me lip the bam man snap-
ped peel the gear off that nag and put it
back where yuh got it badge man or no
badge man yuh aint runnin over meraine
i got orders to-hey let go of me

  his voice ended on a high howl of alarm
for raines right arm had shot out his hand
seizing a greasy shirt front raine began
shaking the scrawny cursing man furiously
buttons flew and cloth ripped but raine
did not let up until joe seeleys head rolled
loosely above his blocky shoulders

 who gave yuh orders to keep me from
takin my hoss raine demanded

  sheriff newton thats who seely gulp-
ed

r

    aine shoved him away then turned to
    the stall and led wampum out

find newton and tell him i took my
loot of the

hoss he told seely quietly tell him im
ridin out to watchin man valley but that
ih be back by dark or a little after

  he swung up into saddle and loped away
chuckling a little at joe seelys shrill cursing

  raine swung into the wagon road outside
of town and turned his attention to the tall
wooded ridges that marched away ahead
of him he let wampum travel at an easy
gait so it took the better part of an hour to
bring him to the rim of watching man val-
ley he reined wampum to a stop on the
valley rim looking down the road that an-
gled along a long gentle slope

  the road split near the center of the valley
the right-hand branch e raine knew lead-
ing down the valley to eric kells big rock-
ing k ranch the left-hand fork turned
up-valley raines sweeping gaze followed
it he could see three of the five small places
that occupied the upper third of the fertile
valley and knew by the fenced green fields
lying about one of the places that it was the
farm bart murphy had owned

  raines gaze went on up and across the
valley touching the towering spire of stone
near the valleys head that erosion had
carved to roughly resemble the figure of a
mammoth man he touched wampum gent-
ly with spurs and swung north along the
valley rim instead of riding on down the
road

  within twenty minutes he had located the
other two of the five small places one of
them was located almost at the base of
watching man

  raine quit the rim then and went down
across the valley his sharp eyes alert as he
approached the base of the promontory
above which watching man towered in ma-
jestic silence the rangers attention was on
the cluster of small poorly kept buildings
that marred the otherwise splendid scenery
a mail-box nailed to a crooked post had
vance lang lettered in black

  raine rode into the yard and hailed the
house but the only answer he got was the
shrill whinnying of two horses in a little cor-
ral behind the ranchhouse

  raine rode past the corral and on toward
the steep brushy slope that lifted up to the
rim-rock above studying the surrounding
country attentively he dismounted in a
stand of tall young pine a half-mile from
langs corral dug a pair of indian moccasins
from a saddle-pocket exchanged his boots
for them and toiled up the rough steep
slope afoot studying the ground he covered
with the utmost care

  within half an hour his shirt was clinging

lobo legion	

wetly to his powerful shoulders and his
breath came in whistling gulps but the
ranger had found what he hoped to find-
a narrow trail that had been cut through the
tough brush raines eyes gleamed with sat-
isfaction as he turned into the trail-more
like a tunnel since only the lower branches
had been chopped away to make a passage
through the heavy thickets

  darned clever he panted anybody
lookin down from the rim-rock or up from
the valley floor would never know there was
a trail here

  he began struggling up the trail bent al-
most double even dropping to hands and
knees at times he was nearing the base of
the towering stone bluff that ran straight up
to where the watching man stood guard
when he heard a stone fall

  raine froze instantly trying to hold in his
laboring breath but with little success he
heard the stone come tick-tick-tick down
the bluff to land in the brush somewhere
ahead of him

  it had been a small stone such as the foot
of a careless or hurrying climber might dis-
lodge from a steep trail and there was a
trail of sorts going up that sheer bluff-a
narrow shelflike ledge that slanted steeply
up and across the face of the bluff as a boy
raine had traversed that steep and danger-
ous path and knew that someone could be
coming down from the rim-rock

  he tried to get a clear view without ex-
posing himself but the best he could get
was a brief glimpse of the bluff rearing
above him pocked by cave openings that
seemed to look back at him like sightless
eyes most of those caves were small and
shallow yet there were a few which were
large enough for a man to crawl into

one near the top of the ledge trail was
wide enough for a man to walk into
and was the first of a series of vaulted cham-
bers that reached two hundred feet or more
into the stone raine wanted to search that
big cave thoroughly for he had a hunch that
in the cave was the answer to why bart
murphy roy fleer and ott shope had been
killed

  had someone guessed that he had seen
through the smoke screen so cleverly thrown
around those three murders had that small
stone been dislodged by the scurrying feet
of a man who had already committed three
cold-blooded killings and was in a hurry to
commit another

  raine sat there in the tunnel that had been
hacked through the thick brush every sense
	exciting

alert the towering bluff was he knew
swarming with rock squirrels they scurried
over the ledges and along the crevices by the
score and it was possible that one of them
had dislodged that stone he had heard come
tumbling down that explanation did not
exactly satisfy him he had waited all of
ten minutes then grimly resolved to waste
no more time

  he went chi along the man-made trail but
with such skill that no sound could have
betrayed him to the keenest ears when he
came to the trails end he stretched flat along
the stony earth waiting until his breathing
became easier

  his sharp eyes studied the cliff keenly fol-
lowing the ledge trail that started upward
only a few paces from where he lay and
navajo tom raine knew now that a mans
hurrying feet had loosened that stone he had
heard falling

  nowhere along the face of the bluff was
there a rock squirrel to be seen they had
taken to their holes which meant that a man
or men had come within range of their sharp
bright eyes and boiling out in a wheeling
cloud above the rim-rock raine saw bats
fluttering dazedly about in the sunlight

  someone had gone into that big cave the
bats coming out before the sun was down
proved that but how many had gone into
the cave raine wished he knew

  but theres a way to find out he mused
grimly if i go up that trail without too
much fuss-

  easing his body out from beneath the
screening bushes he stood up eyes hard and
alert hands dropping to ease the turquoise-
butted guns in their holsters then raine
was moving silent as a shadow his moccasins
making no sound as he stepped upon the
shelf of stone that swung its narrow way to
the rim-rock high above

  he moved more easily now for the spiral-
ing trail would not bring him within view of
anyone watching from the mouth of the big
cave until he was within a hundred feet of
it but nevertheless he kept his eyes on the
ledge ahead and his hands within easy reach
of gun-butts

  a cave mouth loomed darkly on his right
but raine barely glanced at it remembering
that it reached only a dozen feet or so back
into the bluff he was looking at a narrow
strip of trail just beyond the shallow cave
where part of the stone shelf had fallen away
since he had seen it last it was still passable
but raine realized tht he would have to do
some careful stepping to keep from falling

  he slowed down as he reached the narrow

western

place leaning close to the bluff a quick
glance showed boulders and stout bushes be-
low the narrow spot then behind him sud-
denly came the whispery rasp of leather on
stone the hard gust of strainii  breath

  raine backed off the narrow bit of trail
with more speed than safety dictated his
hands ready to slap against six-shooter
grips once he reached better footing but
he had only started to turn when something
slammed against the base of his skull with a
force that blinded him robbed his body of
strength he felt hands clutch him felt his
ankles kicked savagely from under him

  raic struck the ledge on his stomach and
a mans weight came down heavily pinning
him with a knee that ground punishingly in-
to the small of his back raine heard a gut-
tural laugh felt a hot blast of breath on his
cheek as his attacker bent above him

the ranger tried to move tried to free
the guns he still gripped but a fist
smashed against the side of his head sent his
brain reeling toward oblivion then some-
thing cool and thin touched his throat circled
his neck and lay quivering against his flesh
before the cool thin thing bit in became a
band of raw blaze reaching into every fiber
of him raine knew that the thing was a wire
slip-noose the sort of weapon that had taken
the lives of bart murphy roy fleer and
ott shope

  instinctively the rangers hands flashed up
fingers clawing for the wire but he was too
late the man on his back yanked fiercely
and the wire bit with all its murderous might
raines breath was cut off and as pain and
strangulation pushed his already shock-
numbed mind closer to the brink of oblivion
heknew that he had but one slim hope of
escape left

  and while the one feeble spark of reason
was still alive in his tortured being he
whipped all of his fading strength into one
single arching motion of his body flinging
himself deliberately toward the edge of the
stone shelf

  faintly as if the man were far away raine
heard his attacker curse savagely the wire
bit with savagery into the rangers throat
but that one lurch had been sufficient raine
felt the edge of the stone shelf slip beneath
his shoulders heard the man who had tried
to kill him yell in rage or dismay

  then the ranger was hurtling out into
space the wire loosening about his throat
but below jagged boulders beneath-the stout
bushes were waiting like bared fangs to finish
what the killer had begun

chapter iv

proof of a prophecy

was something
in the way the

	v here

  p eerie

j  score or more of men
i i just stood there beneath
 ii the big bull pine on the
brow of cemetery hill
they stood without
moving and without
speaking the yellow
light from the half-doz-
en lanterns on the
ground touching their
chins and throats but
leaving their cheeks and eyes in shadow be-
cause each mans head was tilted back their
eyes stared up at a small wiry figure that
dangled limply above them

  the hanged mans hands had been tied be-
hind his back and a thin rope knotted tight-
ly about his booted ankles the body swayed
gently in the night breeze and navajo tom
raine seeing the narrow face and hooked
nose knew that sime benge would never
ride the outlaw trails again

  raine halted out in the fringe of shadows
his hard eyes dropping from sime benges
dead face to study the men who were look-
ing up at the corpse sheriff newton and big
eric kell were there and anse bishop was
standing between vance lang and elmer
grant the undertaker

  finally someone in the crowd moved said
something in a low awed tone other men
shifted then and the tilted heads came down

  all right the sheriff said harshly we
aint doin him any good just standin and
lookin we may as well cut him down i
reckon but at least i got to see this one
before he was cut down

  he must have fought that noose pretty
hard sheriff judgin from the way his neck
is skinned elmer grant said

  of course he did the sherift snorted
the poor devils neck aint broke or his
headd be saggin different them other three
didnt have their necks broke either and i
remember their necks was scraped pretty
bad too of course theyd already been cut
down from this durned tree and lugged to
your funeral parlor before i got a look at
em but i do remember them skinned necks
grant

  yuhre still sore because somebody didnt
ride all the way out to kells rockin k and
fetch yuh in to view them other three new-
ton anse bishop said as coroner i or-

dered them bodies cut down which was
legal i didnt send fr yuh because i didnt
see any sense in it there wasnt a thing yuh
could do if yuh want to be in on what takes
place here why dont yuh live in town in-
stead of out at kells ranch

  anse bishops voice was soft-toned and
his moon-face looked friendly enough but
navajo tom raine wished he could see the
expression in bishops hooded dark eyes

  squabblin wont get us anywheres
vance lang barked lets get benges body
cut down

 the merchant seemed tense and jumpy
and raine saw that the man was scowling
his black eyes flashing nervous glances at big
eric kell and the sheriff

  i can beat goin after a ladder to get him
down a bow-legged little cowhand declared

  he hurried out of the circle of lantern
light and presently raine heard a horse
snort and heard the squeak of saddle leather
as the puncher mounted then bow-legs was
back in the lantern light riding a big straw-
berry roan beneath the tree the roan
snorted and shied at sight of the hanged man
but willing hands laid hold of bit rings and
the horse was forced beneath the swinging
corpse

  the cowboy stood up on the saddle lantern
light shone on a naked blade in his hand
then sime benges corpse was being eased to
the ground the cowboy rode out of the
lantern light and the crowd watched in
silence while the sheriff and big eric kell
knelt beside the body

  his neck aint broke kells voice
rumbled anybody thatd swing a man up
and let him just choke to death deserves a
dose of the same if yuh ask me

  raine was coming into the lantern light
now and there was a medley of excited
voices and stamping feet as men got hastily
out of his way raine had hoped to watch
the reactions of certain men to his sudden
appearance but there was too much milling
around too many voices muttering startled
exclamations for raine to keep tabs on any
one person

he halted well within the circle of
light a ragged blood-smeared appari-
tion with a bloody white cloth wrapped
around his hatless head

  dried blood looking as black as smears
of tar in the lantern light streaked the rang-
ers face and around his lean throat was
a swollen ridge red and angry-looking
against his brown skin raines eyes were
like polished jade-bright hard cold he
	exciting western

looked slowly from face to bug-eyed face
and his scratched blood-caked hands were
only inches from the turquoise butts of his
guns

 wh-what happened to you vance
langs voice rose thin-edged and jumpy

  raines eyes fastened on langs face as the
merchant peered at him from the outer edge
of the lantern light

  some hombre jumped me from behind
knocked me cold and tried to twist a wire
around my neck the ranger said flatly
he got the wire pulled tight and i wouldnt
be here to tell it if i hadnt rolled over the
edge of a cliff trail i got skinned up some
but that dont matter what makes me mad
is that i never did get a look at the gent

  that wire shore marked your neck all
right eric kell declared and yuh must
have been plumb on top of watchin mans
head when yuh fell from the looks of yuh

  i wasnt quite that high up but i was
out there raine said gravely howd you
know thats where i was kell

  the big ranchmans face slowly crimsoned

  me and my big mouth he groaned so
help me raine i just mentioned watchin
man because thats the highest point for
miles around i reckon i was just tryin to
joke which wasnt smart seein yuhre hurt
but honest raine-hey whered yuh get
that kells voice ended on a smothered
yell of surprise

  raine had stepped forward pulling a piece
of black-and-white-checked cloth from his
hip pocket it was the pocket from a mans
shirt and big eric kells craggy face slowly
turned from red to white as he looked down
at his own black-and-white-checked shirt
the material identical with that of the piece
raine held and on kells shirt a bright
spot outlined by torn stitches showed where
a pocket had recently been ripped away

  raine i didnt have nothin to do with
what happened to you kell declared after
a long charged silence

  well go into that later raine told him
quietly

  he turned finding vance lang who had
moved in closer the undertaker and anse
bishop had been talking with lang in low
tones but watching raine and kell their
whispering broke off abruptly when raine
glanced at them

  lang lay hold of sime benges shoul-
ders raine said crisply you bishop get
benges feet untied get hold of one of his
legs and grant can get the other three of
yuh can lug him down to the funeral parlor
easy

  nothin doing lang began i aint
touchin him i

  shut up and do what yuhre told raine
barked savagely ftll bring up the rear with
kell and sheriff newton

  bishop and grant were muttering darkly
but stopped abruptly when lang said some-
thing to them in a low tone the three of
them lifted sime benges light body up and
the eerie procession followed two bobbing
lanterns down the hill

  raine motioned for eric kell and sheriff
newton to go ahead of him and the big
ranchman turned slowly sheriff newtons
sunken eyes burned into raines and for a
moment the bony hands of the sheriff quiv-
ered above gun butts but he turned finally
and fell in step with kell and navajo tom
raine heaved a sigh of relief

hen they were finally in the square
grim room at the back of elmer
grants furniture store raine saw that kell
was drawn and white but far from being
cowed grant had lighted two big wall lamps
and the scrawny body of sime benge was
stretched out on a table

  bar that back door bishop before the
crowd out there gets in raine directed

  bar it yoreself after i go out the moon-
faced hotel man said in his soft whispery
voice speakin of bars reminds me i need
a drink

  do what yuhre told and no cussed fool-
ishness raine cut in angrily and you
grant quit lookin at that corpse like you
wanted to laugh

  bishop and grant both whirled on raine
swearing and wanting to know who he
thought he was

  shut up both of yuh vance lang
barked at them and a keen sparkle shone in
raines eyes when both men obeyed quickly

  bishop barred the back door and grant
turned his back on the corpse

  raine i may as well tell you about that
shirt pocket now although i know yuhll
never believe me eric kell said

  there was a moment of silence in the room

  the ranger sensed that this was an im-
portant moment for the men some deal had
been rigged up between them-or between
some of them and now they intended to pull
it off rather to pull the wool over raines
eyes

  the ranger stepped back his face impas-
sive he always was a good listener and he
never was a better one than at this moment

  go ahead he told kell i might even
believe you at that
loot of the lobo legion



chapter v

lobo loot

   wance lang had been
grinning faintly as he
listened to what kell
was protesting to be the
truth raine gave him a
steady look then looked
back at kell nodding his
bandaged head slowly

  all right he said to
kell evenly tell me
about it but first let
me make a guess i see a
bruise on yore jaw and
notice yuhre wearm yore hat tilted to the
right keepin it off of what looks like a lump
above yore left ear so my guess kell is
that some gent caught yuh off guard batted
yuh to sleep ripped that pocket off yore
shirt then left yuh to wake up and wonder
what in thunder it was all about am i
right

  yuhre so right im a gone goslin kell
groaned thats exactly what did happen to
me-when i was down at the bam right
after dark lookin after my hoss but since
it was so easy for yuh to guess yuhll think

i	just made up a tale to keep out of trouble
whered yuh find the durned shirt pocket
hung on a bush where yuh couldnt help
seein it when yuh picked yourself up after
failin over the cliff trail

  i found yore shirt pocket in my room at
bishops hotel raine said quietly

  in yore room kell echoed blankly

  by golly eric mebbe yuh tore it off this
afternoon after raine locked us in there
sheriff newton said hopefully

 nope kell shook his head doggedly
thats the pocket i always carry my smokin
tobacco and cigarette papers in i rolled and
smoked three-four cigarettes this afternoon
and the pocket was there until that cuss
biffed me at the barn

  of course kell yuh could have got that
bruised jaw and the knot on yore head in a
fight raine said drily and there shore
has been a fight up in my room or did you
gents upset things that way before yuh got
out this afternoon

 we didnt muss yore room up none the
sheriff snapped anse bishop come up and
turned us out

  what was the idea iri tellin joe seely i
wasnt to have my hoss raine asked

  that fool the sheriff snorted all i
told the knot-head was to send yuh down to

see me before yuh pulled out anywheres
but whats this about somebody havin a
fight up in yore room raine

  sime benge was killed in my room to-
night raine said coldly

   what eric kell and the sheriff cried in
 the same breath

  wait raine vance lang barked yuh
found kells shirt pocket in yore room and
the room shows theres been a fight there
benge was hung to that pine on cemetery
hill so he wasnt killed in yore room but
mebbe he was caught there then drug off to
that pine where he was strung up

  shore-thats the way the killer wanted
it to look raine agreed soberly but sime
jbenge didnt die from hangin neither did
 the other three men who were found swingin
from that old pine die from hangin

   did that fall yuh got addle yore wits
 sheriff newton snapped bart murphy roy
 fleer and ott shope shore as blazes did die
 from hangin so did sime benge and if
 yuhll take a look at that rope burn on his
 neck yonder yuhll quit arguin about it
 you take a look at that rope burn on
 benges neck newton raine said gravely
 you look too kell and if you two dont
 see the mistake benges killer made inside
 of a couple of seconds then yuh ought to
 give up ever hopin to tell a calf from a
 coyote the rest of yore lives

   raine glanced at vance lang who was re-
 garding him out of thoughtfully puckered
 eyes anse bishop was scowling looking
 tensely at lang elmer grant fidgeted mak-
 ing sniffling sounds as he watched eric kell
 and sheriff newton peei toward the corpse

   so help me raine i cant see anything
 but just a rope bum around benges neck
 the sheriff said finally

  me neither kell admitted that bum
around benges neck is all i see and that
shore looks to me like he hung in a noose
and fought till the life was choked out of
him

   yuhve both said it but cant see it
 raine snorted

   said what the sheriff asked testily
 yuh both said the bum is around benges
 neck raine reminded

  well it is newton snapped them
other three who got hung to that pine tree
had the same kind of rope burns around
their necks too

  shore raine said with slow emphasis
all four men had rope burns right around
the middle of their necks but a man who
fought a noose till it choked him to death
would be burned high on the neck and up
	exciting western

under the jawbones and you two ought to

know it

  by glory eric raine is right the sheriff
cried

  now go take a close look at that burn
around sime benges neck raine said cold-
ly yuhtl find it aint a bum but was done
by scrapin the skin with somethin sharp
and yuhll also find that that scrapin was
done to hide a mark like the one yuh see
around my neck-the mark of a thin wire
that was jerked around sime benges neck
and kept good and tight till he died

eric kell and the sheriff rushed
toward the corpse talking excitedly
but raine was not watching them when he
had finished speaking he had raised his
gleaming glance to elmer grant

  the sharp-nosed undertaker tried to glare
but suddenly his nerve cracked and a cry
that was more like the cry of a beast than
that of a man beat against the walls of the
room as elmer grant plunged toward the
barred back door one skinny hand yanking
a gun from inside his shirt

  navajo tom raine took three running
steps and all his weight and power were be-
hind the fist that crashed against grants
pointed chin the undertaker turned a com-
plete flip and came down like a wet sack
the gun in his hand skidding across the hard
floor

  but raine did not stop to watch grant for
a gun roared at his right and he felt the
bum of the bullet across his side as he spun
on moccasined feet his own turquoise-butted
weapons out and thundering into the echoes
of the other weapon over against the wall
big anse bishop dropped a smoking gun
clapped both pudgy hands to has fat middle
and made little whimpering sounds as he
sagged slowly down dying

  raine winced when another bullet took
skin from his already blood-smeared face
but his hands were steady as he threw two
quick shots at vance lang

   langs voice lifted in a high thin yell when
his smoking gun fell from numbed fingers
the merchants right arm was broken half-
way between wrist and elbow but he
dropped to the floor cursing savagely as he
grabbed the gun up in his left hand but
raine was beside him slashing down with
still smoking colt before lang could palm
the dropped colt in his left hand and fire
the rangers chopping six-shooter thudded
into langs skull angl the merchant stretched
out senseless but still alive

  raine stood up pulled a deep breath into

his lungs and glanced at eric kell and sher-
iff blake newton they stood gaping at him
thin eyes as round as marbles raine re-
loaded his guns dropped them into holsters
and sleeved blood from his cut and battered
face

  thanks boys for the help he said drily
what the blue blazes raine kell
gulped what got into them three any-
how

  its a long story and im too blamed tired
and stove up to go into it right now raine
sighed just jail vance lang and that grant
lobo where they cant see or talk with each
other then play one against the other
grants weak so make him think lang is ac-
cusin him of killin bart murphy roy fleer
ott shope before and sime benge tonight
if yuh make grant believe lang is layin the 
killins on him hell talk

  lang killed them four the sheriff asked
sharply

  shore raine nodded all of em
thought lang was their friend so he could
catch em off guard easy he choked the
four men to death with a wire noose then
hung em to that bull pine elmer grant
scraped the skin around the necks of the
first three to hide the wire marks after they
were cut down but sime benge got hep to
that and told me about it

  so it was benge talkin to yuhout there
on the trail the sheriff said as he frowned
but go on raine why would vance lang
want to kill them four

  did yuh know that all four of the men
who were killed once rode in ike siscos lobo
pack raine asked

  i did blake newton nodded or at
least raine i was pretty shore they had
but whats that got to do with their bein
killed by that mouthy lang buzzard

  did yuh happen to know ike sisco
raine asked soberly

  know him newton snorted him and
me hunted wild hosses together before he
turned bad he was a big loud-mouthed
towhead swaggerin and cocky as long as
things went his way but yeller as a mongrel
dog when he got into a tight i never have
been able to figger where ike sisco dug up
the brains and the nerve to get to be one of
the slickest bandits this country ever knew
ike sisco never bossed the lobo legion
hes supposed to have bossed raine said
flatly he was only a figgerhead a big-
mouthed two-for-a-nickel four-flusher who
didnt have any better sense than to let the
brains behind that gang talk him into posin
as the leader
loot of the lobo legion

heriff newton looked toward the
 stocky grizzled man lone pine had
known as a successful merchant

  lang he said sharply

  lang raine nodded theres yore real
leader of the ike sisco gang newton

 but why would lang turn on his own
men eric kell asked heavily

  when the rangers killed ike sisco vance
lang knew that his days of banditry were
over raine said calmly he didnt dare
operate any more and he didnt want to
split up the rich cache with his remainin
men so-

  ive heard them wild yarns about the ike
sisco gang cachin every dollar they ever
took in the sheriff homed in you dont
believe no such tale do yuh raine

 raine nodded

  the serial numbers on the bills in at least
two money shipments that bunch stole are
known yet none of the money has ever
shown up add to that the fact that a brainy
coyote like vance lang started killin off his
gang and im pretty sure the answer is
hidden loot

 how about anse bishop and elmer
grant eric kell wanted to know yuh
figger they was members of the ike sisco
gang

 grant and bishop could have been mem-
bers of the outlaw bunch or vance lang
could have talked em into some kind of a
deal to help him get rid of the four men he
killed rain shrugged the sheriff can get



the answer to that when he starts workin
on lang and grant-

  if we could only find that cached loot
the sheriff said tensely but langll never
tell where it is because as long as he dont
the law will likely keep him alive hopin to
find all that missin money and gold bullion
then dust off yore best hangnoose new-
ton raine said quietly we wont have to
try makin lang tell where the loot is be-
cause i already know

  where the sheriff and eric kell yelped
in the same excited breath

  raine grinned wryly the loots in a
cave and i know the trail to it he said

  tuck yore two prisoners in good newton
and see that a sawbones sets langs broken
arm then you and kell meet me at the
hotel at sunup if yuh want in on a treasure
hunt thatll keep every jaw in this country
waggin for the next twenty years

 how can yuh be so blamed shore yuh
know where that loot is hid the sheriff
asked uneasily

   vance lang showed me where to look
for it raine chuckled he went into a
certain cave today and scared out a lot of
bats then he sneaked down the ledge trail
to jump me he ran into that first cave to
see if id found his cache yuh can bet on
that so meet me at sunup if yuh want to
help fetch that loot to town

  raine strode to the door and stepped
quickly out through with answering ques-
tions for the night

 hated wire

by barry scobee

over the vast expanse of a huge texas cattle empire ward
nickerson fights desperate foes as he takes up the guest
of his missing pards and strives to solve a range mystery

chapter i
lonesome stranger

a r d
nick-
erson
sat alone with his
bitter thoughts on
the edge of a board
sidewalk in the un-
painted dusty little
southwestern cow-
town that was too
far from any rail-
r o a d ever to be
more than a sort of hideout

  for the most of three days now he had
waited in the november shade and sun for
a man to show up a little man just a little
man without a name so far as ward knew
what it might be a man whom he must see
before he could ride back to his little ranch
with any peace of mind

  he knew the description of the man would
recognize him if he ever saw him he had
asked the three leading men of the town-
the banker the bartender and the livery
stable keeper-about the little man and
had got nothing but evasions at least
they seemed to be evasions anyhow neither
the man of money the man of drinks nor the
man of hay and horses was talking just
being careful maybe with a stranger

  hardly a soul was on the street this sunny
forenoon the barber across the way was
giving himself a haircut in front of his mirror
now and then the big cheerful bartender in
the saloon behind ward broke into song a
cowboy came out of the general store with a
new shirt unwrapped and changed into it in
an alley throwing his old one away

then a rider turned into the street from

the north wards pulse picked up for the
man was small he looked plumb little in the
saddle

  he rode on into town and tied his horse at
a rack on the streets south side and scanned
the thoroughfare up and down warily re-
moving his chaps he hung them on the sad-
dle left a big gun dangling from his belt
gave his pants a hitch and came across

  the little man was on the shabby side and
the rabbity side not much to his small face
and the fingers of his left hand were stiff
and bent and crippled

  yep this was the fellow ward nickerson
had been waiting for he gave ward a fur-
tive stare that was oddly enough penetrat-
ing what he saw was a tall lean man with
a straight nose a man wearing the garb of
the cow country and idly whittling a match
then he paid no more attentic but legged
his jockey body up to the high sidewalk
heel-thumped across and entered the saloon

  so this was it ward told himself his
future right here in the present ten minutes
to a half-hour that could shape the rest of
his life whether it be long or short

  ward stood up snapped his knife shut
dropped it into a pocket gave his pants a
hitch and followed into the place of drinks
he had no gun having with considered
judgment left it in his hotel room

it was any saloons slackest hour only
the barman and the little customer were
present ward pried at white aprons face
half expecting to see a nod that this was the
small man ward had inquired about but
the bartenders big pleasant mug gave no
sign ward closed in to the neat pine bar
and looked down at the little man

  im a lonesome stranger he said how
about my daddyin the first round

  the little man glanced up surprisingly

an exciting complete action novelet



	exciting western

quick and sharp

  i buy my own stuff he said

  white apron grinned and set out a quart
bottle of beer little man slid a quarter and
a nickel carefully across the polished wood
ward shrewdly perceived that there was no
use to be coy guileful or wheedling

  my names nickerson he said flatly
whats yores

  the little man poured into a glass drank
thirstily then lifted his pale eyes up to ward
with that curious furtive-hard stare

  none of your business mister but its
tyle-albert tyle

  thanks mr tyle id like a little chin-
chin with yuh when yuh finish yore drink
you a law

  no

  what yuh want to chin about

  i can wait till yuhre through ward
glanced at the barkeep gus how about
using yore back room

  its good enough for the jack of spades
and the queen of diamonds said white
apron ought to do for you fellers

  albert tyle finished his beer regretfully
peered up at ward and jerked his head
toward the rear as they headed for the
back room tyle looked at the barman and
slapped his six-gun

  if i have to he said itll be in self-
defense

  no shootin men in here white apron
said humorously

  in the back room albert tyle slide side-
ward into a chair at the green-covered poker
table with his right arm and gun out in the
open for free action ward took the opposite
side forearms on the table hands in sight
to show good intentions

  spit said tyle

 yuh was workin on warren abbotts
pig-in-a-poke ranch one year ago ward
opened bluntly

  was i startled fear darted across the
mans small face and was gone howd yuh
know i was here	

  well get to that

  thinking how to start ward became lost
in the contemplation of far-off things a
lonely stranger in his own thoughts seeing
the colossus of a ranch called the rod-and-
compass but which men not associated with
it sneeringly had named the pig-in-a-poke
or the pig-on-a-pole because of its unusual
brand it was a vast sweep of land that
blocked ward nickersons life other mens
lives womens lives that made a woman
look at ward nickerson with scorn a ranch

and its fence that made ward afraid of-
himself

  tyle he said coming back to the im-
mediate warren abbotts outfit has a thou-
sand square miles his granddad started it
his father built it up now warren abbott
has a six-strand barbwire fence around it
with posts twenty feet apart and only one
gate in all that fence hes made an empire
out of it a nation all his own all men are
forbid to go on his land except at the gate
warren abbott dont mix with local people
spends half his time in cities hes a state-
wide big it hes known in new york and
washington the papers call him a patron
of the arts and a philanthropist he-

  i know all that bunk

  all right six years ago i bought me a
little twelve-section anch against abbotts
wire in the six years five men have gone
through the wire and never been heard of
again by friends or relatives one of my
neighbors is dean hysinger which yuh
probly know about a year ago his son got
sore and went across the wire he disappear-
ed vanished like smoke you was workin
on the ranch at that time-one of abbotts
fence riders or guards or whatever he calls
em what can yuh tell me about buddy
hysinger

  howd yuh find out i was here tyle
demanded again

  fair enough albert about two years
and a half ago lem singleton vanished inside
the abbott country he and his brother bill
had a ranch against the wire lem resented
the fence because it shut him out of gods
free land as he said the fence does men
that way once on a little toot lem cut the
wire and rode through never was seen
again it worked on bill singleton so much
he sold out and went to arizona or nevada
the other day he come back just to see if
anything had ever turned up about lem on
the trip he passed through this settlement
saw you remembered yuhd been on the
pig-in-a-poke when lem disappeared

tyles little face was pinched into a knot
of anger and contrariness and half-
doubt

  yuhre lyin he spat out singleton
didnt say nothin to me-if he seen me
hes an old broke-up man albert no
spunk left he didnt want to stir up the old
mess said he was afraid of yuh as a killer
he told it all in a crowd of men thats how
i happened to hear somebody else said yuh

levelled at bin

singer

  bill singleton called me a killer uh
tyle snarled i aint no killer

  me im not sayin you are tyle what

  whats yore burnin itch to know

  ward stared out the dusty window his
fingers tapped on the green baize of the
table presently his absent look returned
to tyle

  ill put all my cards on the table he
said when buddy disappeared i was away
from home up in new mexico makin a
little money buyin on commission for a cat-
tle trader buddyd been gone a month when
i got back old dean hysinger and his
daughter worth thought i ought to dive into
the abbott country on the hunt for him
yuhd been a fool to try it

  i knew that instead of goin in i got hold
of some half-political help who got some
high political pull and they got the governor
to send out some state officers to investigate



they didnt find buddy not even a trace
it has preyed on old hysingers mind hes
afraid of his shadow these days all broke
up worth sees her dad dyin by inches it

men or the scorn of a woman i think she
believes im afraid of that fence or of whats
inside i am but not the way she thinks
im afraid of what i might find if i got inside
and would have to tell em about-a grave
mebbe or bones gnawed by coyotes and
bleached white in the sun or the kid held
prisoner till hes crazy

  wards fingers tapped a disconsolate march
on the baize then he went on

  im afraid in another way that wire
fence-when the sun is right it glitters and
winks at me glitters and smirks and mocks
and dares me tyle im afraid ill up and
go through some day and thatll be the end
of me ward heaved himself to his feet
stuck out an emphasizing finger not that
td give a hoot tyle not one single hoot if
i could clean out that gang of killers wipe
out that ranch empire that breaks men ruins
	exciting

men-ward broke off and im supposed
to be level-beaded excuse it albert what
im afraid of mebbe is gettin wiped out and
leavin dean hysinger and worth there
alone and helpless yuh see what a stew men
get into

  yeh said tyle nastily yuh put on a
good show

  all right tyle all right but what has
abbott got on that ranch that hes so bent
to keep hid what kind of murder mill has
he got in his forests and rocks his hills and
canyons

  the little mans face pinched tight in sud-
den terror

  i aint talkin-i tell yuh i aint talkin
he half screamed he straightened to his feet
overturning his chair i got away from
that tophet-i aint talkin

  ward put all the persuasion he possessed
into his words

tyle what became of buddy hysinger
tyle snarled and sidled around the table
toward the outer door he looked like a
cross between a rabbit and a wolf he laid
a hand on the doorknob the other on his gun

  nickerson he said if you was the only
man knowed i was here id kill yuh to shut
yore mouth but looks like too many know
it theres men on abbotts they dont let
yuh get away yore snoopin will get yuh
into it all theyll be after me ive got to
fadeaway now cuss that crazy bill single-
ton ive got to move on be a shadder fiittin
hither and yon to and fro-cuss their souls
ward stepped around the table to the
inner door his hand found the knob so
this was the end of the trip the seal on the
future he looked at albert tyle their
eyes held and held then tyle spoke once
more

  mister ill tell yuh this he gulped his
adams apple horror in his little twisting
face that hysinger button was-was kill-
ed

  for a moment ward stood staring at tyle
as if numbed by this revelation a cold wind
seemed to sweep over ward and chill him
from head to toe he wanted to speak and
yet he could think of no words

  killed ward finally managed to say
and tell me how the boy was killed

  i aint tellin no more tyle said

  but you didnt mean to let it go with that
much ward pointed out

  thats all im saying tyle replied edg-
ing back im no fool

  then he was out th door slamming it
behind him

trailing with death

ack in the big room
ward saw two men at
the bar booted spur-
red big high-hatted six-
footers one had a han-
dle-bar mustache they
turned their faces and
regarded ward as he
approached them

 hiya stranger
mustache spoke up
come up and join us
thanks but im in
kind of a shove ward answered barely
aware of what was said

  ten minutes afterward he had his gun and
horse and was riding eastward out of the
silent town he remembered albert tyle
and craned around the little man was no-
where to be seen but the two tail-looking
men of the saloon were standing on the walk
and it seemed as if they were gazing after
him

  a half-mile out of the settlement wards
preoccupied thoughts remembered the two
men he looked back the two or a pair like
them were riding out of town as if on his
trail his mind gathered in something then
that he had barely noted without really
registering there in the saloon the eyes of
the two men had been on him as sharp and
glittering as weasel eyes

  ward held his horse to its easy tireless
saddle gait when he looked over his shoul-
der the two riders were no nearer ward
lifted to a lope the pair back there did like-
wise minutes later when ward dropped
down to a walk the men slowed also a
ticklish crawl went along wards spine no
doubt about it they were on his trail he
faced them and waited they came up with
bright watchful eyes

  yuh wouldnt drink with us said mus-
tache mebbe yuhll ride with us

  id be plumb scared to run from yuh
said ward turning his horse in the direction
they were riding

  they parted to get him between them in
a quick shift ward got on their left they
would have to shoot across their bodies his
gun could fire the instant it jumped from its
leather

  at wards move the pretended good nature
drained from their faces ward chuckled

grimly
hated wire	 

  if its a hold-up he said yuh wont get
much but my hoss and saddle

  smooth face the better of the two men
ward surmised said easily enough

  yuh kind of shovin the betting

  might as well get the turkey cooked
ward drawled

  whatd a tell yuh demanded smooth
face

  al

  albert tyle in the back room we heard
him at the last-voice kind of ratty

  so yuhre a couple of warren abbotts
crows ward observed and was shocked
that the big outfit must be keeping tabs on
him

  nothing more was said for some little
distance

  then handle-bar mustache spoke

  al floated off nigh a year ago just got
wind where he was

  yuh didnt see him ride out of town with
me said ward

  seen you though we can pick up lil
al later

  if we dont squatter- too much time
smooth face interjected al can rabbit
away purty fast

  the steady tempo of the horses hoofs on
the hard dry ground creak of saddle leather
jingle of bits and spurs continued the men
kept scanning the country it was empty
not a ranchhouse not even a cow the land
was slightly rolling now only the yellowing
cottonwoods of the town back there were
distantly visible

  ward had never been more alert in any
situation these men would probably be
lightning with their guns his hand lifted
to his own six-shooter he disliked to take
that advantage but he would probably need
that much of a start

  the horses slowed in the ascent of a little
rise at the summit the pair pulled up and
took in what was below

  ditch said mustache

  brush said smooth face

  ward jerked and spurred his horse the
quick jump put him slightly ahead facing
the pair his fist was on his gun they
studied him bleakly

  mustache turned in his saddle and looked
back toward town smooth faces eyes held
steadily on ward wards on him mustache
spoke

  somebodys cornin on a hoss

  ward caught himself in time neither his
watchful stare nor smooth faces wavered
a hairs breadth

   neat trick if it had worked ward taunt-
 ed

   but there is somebody cornin said mus-
 tache by grabs its al

albert tyle stopped two horses
lengths away desperation in the small

 face

   i dont aim to be a shadder flittin hither
 and yon all over the west he flung out
 nickerson you with me or with them

  they was just about to get their fingers
 burned said ward they was pickin out
 a brush patch for me down there

   i seen em trailin yuh out of town took
 me a good while to make up my mifid hair-
 face there is lee hyatt tother one is tom
 dakin last time i seen em they was ridin
 for abbott at double pay

   mebbe we could all ride back together
 said ward and talk things over with
 abbott

  not that he meant it he only wanted to
see their reaction figure out what they might
now have in mind the abbott gunmen did
not seem to be too much put out dakin the
smooth-faced one said with hard brightness
shore might as well be friends like seein
were all together ride ahead gents
albert tyle laughed a surprising ringing
jeering laugh it made ward half-way like
the man for the first time dakin and hyatt
didnt like it anger flashed in their faces
dakin was the first to make a concession
go ahead lee he directed hyatt

  as hyatt moved out dakin nodded to
ward and they moved off side by side with
tyle bringing up the rear this had its sig-
nificance for ward these men who knew
tyle evidently knew that tyle was not a
man to shoot a man in the back or was this
whole thing a fix-up and if so why

  through noontime and the interminable
afternoon with its vast emptiness the four
held the formation they had started with
except when one got down to open a gate
or they scattered in crossing a rocky creek
at such times they watched one another like
wary dogs on one of these occasions mus-
tache had trouble getting the wire gate back
up

   lees the scaredest of the whole bunch of
 us al tyle watching him said with amuse-
 ment he could tell yuh a whole lot nick-
 erson about lem singleton

  rabbit said lee hyatt yuhre settin
yoreself for intanglemints

  therell be a showdown tonight if hyatt
gets half a chance ward thought
	exciting

  they rode into a scattered town in a gor-
geously clear november sunset there they
took rooms at the shabby wooden hotel
dakin and hyatt together and ward and
tyle separately they ate together since
there was but one table and afterward play-
ed passtime poker for an hour ward liked
the idea it enabled him to keep an eye on
the other three he was the winner coming
out with eleven dollars of dakins and hyatts
money

  they went upstairs and to their rooms at
the same time without undressing ward
lay on his bed thinking in the dark it was
an impossible situation dangerous dakin
and hyatt had evidently been sent to dis-
patch tyle with tyle and himself having
had a talk he must be included in the wiping
out who was back of it warren abbott
the setup behind the wire

  twice ward thought he heard floor boards
in the hall squeak as if under a stealthy
step abruptly he left the room boldly with
no effort at silence at the rear door of the
hall he paused and listened nobody looked
out or followed he made his way down the
back stairs to an alley then toward the livery
stable where they had left their horses

  a cold night wind had come up blanketing
sounds the milky way was hazed over it
yas too dark to penetrate shadows at all
no citizen seemed to be out

  ward crossed a street and kept on along
the alley at the next street he paused the
livery stable was diagonally across from him
now he leaned against a comer and watch-
ed there was no light or stir around the
stable

  then above the hum of the wind his ears
caught the sound of a movement slowly
his eyes made out the black bulk of a man
standing completely still an arms length
away ward had no idea where he had come
from how long he had been there the man
spoke barely above a whisper

  that you lee it was dakin asking

  when ward did not instanly reply dakin
must have realized his mistake for ward
sensed sudden movement without knowing
how he knew it he was sure a gun was being
raised at him instantly he threw an upper-
cut with his right all his body behind it
his fist hit the softness of a throat the head
tilted back a gun went off

  ward followed the blow with a shove
against the mans face then a full-armed
punch the man went down

  instantly a battle started out in the middle
of the street two guns were stabbing the

western

night with short sharp yellow flashes the
sounds blasted loudly between the buildings
then one gun stopped a man grunted tried
to cry out but dropped the other gun
stopped and ward heard footsteps running
away

as little tyle down in the street
ward ran out with long strides
knelt beside the dark patch of a body his
hand touched a mustache lee hyatt from
a gurgle of blood from the complete limpness
of the body when he shook it ward knew the
man was dead or close to it

  the big door of the livery stable rumbled
open

  hi whats goin on a voice called

  as ward legged it back to the alley dakin
was trying to get up ward kept on he took
the back stairs of the hotel silently went
down the hall down the front stairs the
old landlord was still up ward made some
idle talk paid for his supper and unused
room the old man was half-way suspicious
but said nothing

  when ward got to the stable a little crowd
was in the street with lanterns nobody
seemed to be in the stable he hurried back
along the stalls and saddled his horse but
returned to the big open door for a look
before attempting to ride out he saw men
with lanterns and other men staggering
clumsily along with a body a lantern left
the crowd and came hurrying to the bam it
was the stable proprietor he held up his
lantern and regarded ward

  hah he ejaculated one of the strang-
ers you in that shootin

  no said ward heard the shots i just
come from the hotel somebody get hurt

  yore pardner with the mustache killed

  the others stumbled in with the body laid
it in a stall then they all centered on ward
holding lanterns high and staring at him

  you kill that feller one f the men
demanded

 there was a shout and a horse came
plunging along the barns runway the men
gave back as the rider plunged past them
and out the door ward saw by the light of
the lanterns that it was dakin

  reckon that answers yore question he
said

  the men all ran out dakin had steered to
the right the men shouted and kept on
running a block away there were answer-
ing shouts and two or three shots

  ward went back to his saddled horse he
dropped a half-dollar into the empty feed
hated

box and quietly led his mount to the rear
door there he remembered the httle man
tyle he went back along the stalls tyles
horse was gone

  a minute later ward was out in the windy
night and on his way home

chapter ih

invitation to murder

ard nickerson was
not a man to over-ride
and punish a horse to
gain a few hours on a
trip so it was late af-
ternoon two days later
when he came in sight
of his own little ranch
and also in sight of
the six-strand barb-wire
fence that enclosed war-
ren abbotts vast do-
main

  the wire shimmered in the late sun seem-
ing as usual to smirk and mock and chal-
lenge one of the little board signs that were
nailed to posts every two or three miles
around the entire fence was before him all
at once with the brand of the ranch burned
on it and the stenciled warning

stay off my
country
warren abbott

  stay off or be killed ward thought then
his bitterness vanished as he saw a saddled
horse without a rider on his own land a mile
away

  he lifted his tired mount into a lope the
saddled animal was on the bank of antelope
arroyo a shallow drywash that cut across
the corner of his ranch and swept on into
abbott country in a minute he recognized
the horse as one of his own he rode faster

  as he reached the bank he saw his one
hired man carlos pompa down in the
arroyo repairing the fence carlos looked
up and began to shout excitedly

  mistah-jyard mistah ward our ranch
he shot to pieces bust nineteen fat steers
all gone

  ward plunged down the bank to the rocky
floor he shook hands with the mexican

  keep yore shirt on he said quietly and
tell me what yuhre talkin about

  carlos drew in a quick breath you go
wan week ago you tell me carlos you
gather up them sixty fat steers for market
when i get back home i do i put em in

wire	

thees lil pasture lak you say today now
i come see eef theyall well and happy i
count em forty-one nineteen is not here
fooey lak smoke of the cigarette gone i
ride the wire i find thees hole i find thees
tracks

  ward followed the plentiful tracks of cattle
in the soft moist sand all at once he pointed
to the ground

  that hoss track-is it yores

  hah no i do not see that

  shod track it looks as if somebody drove
the steers through

  they stepped on to the half-mended hole
through the wire against the bank

  whats this ward demanded that
wire wasjeut

  esuremistah ward i see that sombody
mak that hole for purpose

  ward stood tensely pondering he did
not say so to the mexican but he knew that
these tracks the cut wire the missing steers
were an invitation a challenge to ride in on
abbotts country-and be killed or captured
or whatever it was they did to men over
there who had framed the invitation and
why because he had talked with albert
tyle how would they know that here
had dakin got back or tyle

  we go in we find our steers mistah
ward carlos demanded

  well have to get the steers back said
ward or well use bacon grease for butter
this winter and gunnysacks for pants

  les go

  well sleep on it first said nickerson
they finished patching up the hole and
rode on home through the long shadows of
sunset and in gloomy silence   

  ward nickerson spent a dream-filled rest-
less night but by morning something of a
plan had emerged he would stick to the
law as long as he could but he would not
be balked

  he was in a cold saddle by gray and frosty
daylight it was a long ride to town and the
road paralleled the hated wire for miles
the hysinger ranch dimly seen lay off to
the left he thought of turning off to see
how the sick old man and worth were faring
but he hated to hear old hysingers whim-
pering and see his failing body and he
dreaded the hate in worths eyes for abbott
and his outfit and the scorn in her laughter
for-himself as he saw it

  besides he was eager to get to town it
was saturday and abbott would be there
on his weekly trip for mail telegrams and
business at the bank ward did not want to
exciting western

e

miss him

  it was mid-forenoon when he arrived at
the county seat and as chance would have
it almost the first man he saw was warren
abbott the man was riding down the
middle of the main street the thick heavy
figure in the saddle made ward think as
always of a stuffed shirt ward met him
horse-shoulder to shoulder grimly abbott
stopped like a block of rock

  abbott ward opened without greeting
nineteen of my fat steers have got through
yore wire onto yore country

  you should have been more watchful
nickerson the patron of the arts and
philanthropist replied heavily

  the wire was cut ward said flatly

  who cut it

  and my steers were driven through

  evidently you are trying to inform me
that somebody outside of my fence drove
your cattle onto my country to dispose of no
doubt to some of my employes

  no some of yore men cut the wire and
drove the stuff through as bait for me to go
after em

for the first time abbotts eyes really
considered ward his head shook slowly

  i advise you not to go in after them he
said that would be trespassing which is
forbidden

  ward laughed shortly at the mans dog-
matic stupidity abbott gave him a sharper
look then he nade a movement in the saddle
as if to ride on

  ward whirled his horse around and blocked
the way

  im not through yet mister he said
coldly

  ward had been aware that people on the
street were watching them realized that
his stopping abbott blocking the big mans
way was something to make the town gasp
men and women were beginning to move
toward them a rider clattered up wards
steady cold eyes flicked away from abbott
the rider was a girl

  worth he said savagely and wamingly
this may get rough

  how singular she retorted

  other riders were coming up now and
people on foot this was a sight to behold-
somebody talking up to the emperor ward
caught sight of three horsemen coming at a
clipping trot and in a compact group he
recognized them as three of abbotts men-
two foremen and noone gill whom people
knew as abbotts head fence rider or in the

language of the disrespectful his chief of
police

  without slacking the three bunched tight-
ly together in keen teamwork and rode
straight at ward ward saw that he had to
give back or let his horse take an impact
from the three horses he reined back just
barely from in front of abbott and there
held his grou-

  the trio pulled up sharply scarcely an
arms length away noone gill addressed
his boss

  now mr abbott he said respectfully
motioning to the opened path yuh can go
on if yuh want

  abbott acknowledged the mans act with
a slight nod his eyes studied ward anew

  abbott said ward i want my steers
back

  the rod-and-compass abbott replied
formally will pursue its adopted policy in
regard to your stock straying onto my coun-
try nickerson sooner or later my riders
will come across your brand and your cows
will be returned to you

  i need the stuff back now for the fall
beef market snapped ward

you will be notified when they are
found abbott said coldly you may come
in then regularly at the gate and get them
that might be six months or a year
ward said

  it is possible abbott agreed he said
to his men i shall be at the office an hour
or so attending to correspondence before i
arrf ready to start home

  again his body bent slightly in a starting
movement and again ward was in front of
him instantly noone gill spurred his horse
against wards shoving hard deliberately
ward looked down and back and thrust out
his heel and touched barely touched gills
horse with his spur on the tender inner side
of its hind leg

  the already half-excited horse snorted and
jumped sideward all but unseating the sur-
prised gill the crowd snickered the man
did not crowd back for more perhaps not
wanting to be made a fool of before his em-
ployer but fire burned redly in his eyes

  ward leaned forward and seized abbotts
saddle-hom

  mister he said before all these wit-
nesses im askin yuh fair for permission to
go on yore land with one man and bring my
steers out

  a hush fell in it abbott shook his head
slowly and said ponderously

  it is not permitted
hated wire	

  ward drew back he kept his temper but
not his dislike

  abbott he challenged yuhre what the
whole county calls yuh a throw-back yore
father and grandfather no doubt were justi-
fied in shootin trespassers i understand that
fifty forty thirty years ago cattle thieves
were thick hereabouts but every man bor-
dering yuh now owns his land ive never
heard of one of them bein called a rustler
any man will steal cattle if he can avoid
detection said abbott heavily

  wards temper slipped a notch

  abbott he snapped what have yuh got
on yore country yuh dont want honest men
to see what do yuh keep hid in yore can-
yons and mountains whats happened to
the five men who disappeared in the last six
years what kind of murder mill are yuh
operatin inside yore wire

  in the dead silence of the street warren
abbotts slow eyes studied ward nickerson
seemingly without anger as he would study
the sky for weather or try to get at the
meaning of a fool then he nodded to his
men and rode unhurriedly out of the throng
around him

as the crowd dropped away leaving
space worth hysinger nudged her
horse up to wards

  well-well she said derisively

  ward smiled ruefully shook his head

  i dont see how a man can get so set in
his ways in just forty years i might as well
have talked to his land

  policy she said it solidifies the human
mind her gray eyes met his levelly youll
be riding in after your steers she half-said
half-asked

  im talkin with the law next ward
anwered

  policy she repeated and wheeled away
with a low scornful laugh

  a cowboy rode close past ward

  good job ward tellin abbott how he
said a man on foot slapped wards thigh
yuh got him told nickerson

  fennel a neighbor of wards half-whis-
pered

  ward keep yore eye peeled on that noone
gill he aint goin to get over that laugh
yuh put on him easy

  but nobody tells me theyll help me get
my steers back ward thought and i
dont blame em

  he saw sheriff wallace going into the gold
bar saloon might as well tackle him he
decided and trotted his horse to a hitchrack

 inside the gold bar wallace was stepping
 back from the rail when ward went in ward
 touched his arm 

 a word with yuh sheriff if yuh can spare
 the time

 whats time to a sheriff wallace said
 jocularly and followed ward to the poker
 room in the rear

 in the winterish cheerless room smelling
 of dead tobacco smoke wallace faced ward

 dont ever say nickerson that im
 abbotts sheriff but i dont aim to go piroot-
 in with yuh after them steers if thats what
 yuh want

 abbott dont mess with anything as small
 as a sheriff does he said ward

 thats right wallace agreed and flushed
 under his clear pink skin

 how about if i have a warrant wallace
 that would be a hoss with different hair
 but how can yuh swear out a warrant they
 havent stole yore cattle

 hows a search warrant

 a search warrant is tricky theyre
 usually to locate stolen property like i say
 the rod-and-compass havent stole yore
 steers yuhve got to show in a search war-
 rant exactly where said property is whos
 holdin it who took it and so on if yuh
 institoot a false search yuh can be sued and
 so can the sheriff and his bondsmen

 what kind of papers did them state offi-
 cers have ward asked

 yuh mean after buddy hysinger disap-
 peared i dont know i wasnt invited to
 the party

 was abbott hisself in the party

 no the bunch came back savin abbott
 had showed em every consideration fur-
 nished em guides-his own men-wined
 and dined em in the big house and fed em
 roast venison out of season when they got
 back here they acted as if theyd been fed
 and curried by royalty 

who does abbotts killin ward
plumped the question flatly

 hown thunder would i know

 yuh ever know albert tyle

 some

 what about him

 little thats all i can tell yuh why
 ward did not answer he leaned a shoul-
 der against the wall hung his thumbs in his
 belt regarded the officer thoughtfully

 so yuh dont want to take any hand about
 my steers he asked at last

 how can i the sheriff asked plaintively
 well if anything happens wallace yuh
 can say i tried to be legal but didnt get any
exciting western



 encouragement

  thats unfair nickerson

  they faced each other for a moment anger
in the sheriff contempt in ward nickerson
then wallace turned and went out the back
door

  ward opened the door to the saloon room
three men were standing beyond it evident-
ly waiting-abbotts two foremen and his
chief of police noone gill
gill stepped forward quickly peered in
and saw that the room was empty

  dont run nickerson he said i want
a word with yuh in private

  ward flashed a quick grin

  suits me he said and stepped back into
the room

chapter iv
bearding the lion

ell kicked the door to
behind him with an ex-
pensive boot in grow-
ing up he had not at-
tained wards height of
six feet but he was a
little heavier with
smooth-moving muscles
a tailored blue wool
shirt fit his compact
shoulders like a glove

  short of thirty he was
about wards age a
man to have plenty of women partners at a
dance if they didnt see the arrogance in
his handsome face and the rooster-strutting
in his body which ward saw now

  so yuh took a little trip out westly gill
began at once

 here was another man ward decided
with whom there was no use to try sparring

  i saw ai tyle if thats what yuh mean
gill hfe said carelessly

  did the rabbit spill his insides to yuh
not quite as much as id like to have on
you and yore pards as regards buddy hy-
singer

  noone giltflushed around the neck and
anger picked up in him

  yuhve been doin too much fishin in that
direction lately nickerson he growled
the rod-and-compass dont like it

  tm not much concerned any more gill
in what the pig-in-a-poke likes or dont
like

  kind of carefree uh seein yuhre in a
tight anyhow over yore shootin down of

lee hyatt gill was good with a sneer

  did i shoot him ward countred yuh
got the news quick about that and me seein
tyle

  we have our outposts nickerson to keep
us informed besides tom dakin beat yuh
home

 and cut my wire and drove my steers
onto abbotts country i all but rode through
after em yesterday evenin gill yuh dis-
appointed i didnt

  i didnt think yuhd have the nerve to
  eggin me on gill

  the steers is neither there nor here right
now nickerson whats mainly under my
hair right now is what happened out there
in the street a while ago before mr abbott
and a lot of people yuh put the snicker on
me hombre

  what yuh goin to do about it gill
knock yuh through that door behind yuh
and give the laugh back to the crowd in the
barroom

  whats delayin yuh

  gill didnt delay but he underestimated
he drew back and sent a pile-driver punch
at wardsface ward avoided it by a simple
quarter pivot and by jerking his head back
in the same lightning move his left hand
caught the extend arm his right hand
clutched gills necktie and he jerked for-
ward gills impetus helped gills front hit
the door ward flung all his weight and the
power olhis legs against gills back the
door flung open with a bang

  ward going forward caught his balance
first as gill turned wards right arced up
in a long curve to gills chin gills head
clicked up and he sat down six feet away
ward slapped the mans hat off and yanked
gill up by the thick hair of his head ward
gave the old straight punch then the one
with which gill had started the fireworks
and gill hit the thin sawdust at full stretch
on his back

  ward seeing that gills spring was un-
wound for the moment gave the startled
faces at the bar a searching stare then
he grinned a little an enjoying grin and
went clunking for the front door

 worth hysinger caught up with ward
beyond the dingy skirts of the town

  hi hero she was gleeful mind if i
ride as far as the hysinger hacienda with
you

i never object to good company woman
with the emphasis on the good nobody
knows better than you what awful company
ive been the last few months ward the
hated

scandals all over town like bluing in a
washtub-how you put the chief of police
down for a catnap and how youve had a
talk-talk with the ex-killer of the pig-in-a-
poke ward what did you get out of that
albert tyle about buddy

i told him no man likes a womans scorn
thats past ward ill admit that at first
we thought you as a neighbor should cross
the wire and find out about buddy we feel
differently now

  yeah yuh can still light a fire in yore
eye and cackle

  and you can hump a shoulder too tall
man that scorn stuff its just in your mind
what did tyle tell you

  i hate to tell yuh worth its one thing
thats kept me on this side of the wire for a
year what i might have to tell you and yore
dad tyle said buddy was killed

  her breath caught then let go

  thanks ward she said with contained
steadiness its better to know than to go
on imagining worse i know how you must
have hated to give me such news that
ranch that abbott that fence those killers
ive been half crazy for a year ward tell
me more who killed him where is tyle
now with his evidence

he told her all thafhad happened
from the time he had discovered the
two men following him from town after the
talk with tyle to the killing of hyatt on the
road

  dakin got back before i did he said
no doubt in my mind he was the one who
cut the wire and chased my steers through
to toll me in back there-ward nodded
toward the town behind them-noone gill
said i killed hyatt

  theyll put it on you ward if they can
the vile gang worth cried or kill you
ward you mustnt go through after your
steers you dont intend to do you

  thats between me and my conscience if
any

  so you intend to theyll get you sure
dont ward please dont no-no i take that
back ward i wont get in your way i wont
nag but-

  she didnt finish after a mile or two of
silence they began to talk of other things-
grass and stock water the cattle market
new oilcloth for the kitchen table funny isms
wards mexican had sprung they could be
great friends on a ride like this either talk-
ing or remaining silent with their thoughts
for miles

wire	

  ward turned in at the hysinger ranch
with worth for a belated dinner old dean
hysinger once a hustling though a kind of
bookish cowman sat in a hot room by a
roaring stove with a shawl around his shoul-
ders though the november day was quite
sunny

  got no blood any more he complained
no spunk since buddys gone yuh heard
anything new son

  no ward bed

  yuh might have if yuhd gone through
as soon as yuh got back home

  now dad worth protested weve
talked that all out ward would have been
killed by those thugs even if he hadnt been
it isnt likely he could have learned anything
to help

  yes-yes hysinger murmured thats
right ward

  but it wasnt right ward knew as he rode
on home in the shank of the day his not
going in to hunt for buddy still lay between
them and always would and he might as
well have gone hed had to tell worth any-
how that buddy was dead it would not
have hurt much worse a year ago but for a
man to sell his life to be shot down without
recompense without accomplishing any good
gave something to think about   

  with a clawhammer ward nickerson drew
out most of the staples in four posts of the
abbott fence this was five miles from
where his steers had walked through the
hole gills men he supposed would be
laying for him there he stepped carefully
on the loosened wire mashed the strands to
the ground and led his horse carefully
across as he stapled the wire back he smil-
ed in the darkness over his parting conver-
sation with carlos pompa

  wher you goin mistah ward after
them steers

  yes

  me loo

  no not me too carlos youll stay here
and look after things i may be gone for a
couple of days

 couple days hah wher want be
buried if we dont find you

had assured

  two mans more better as one carlos
had pleaded

  nope

  they keel you i no have job no have
butter for bacon grease i mean-i lak you
more bettern bacon-lak butter bettern you
-no-no i mean better bacon grease is you
exciting western



   oh por dios thees english lingo i
mean-

  i know carlos ward had said good-
by

  with a hasty hand-shake ward had headed
for his horse now with the fence restapled
he swung to saddle and struck out into the
forbidden country

  it was the first time he had ever set foot
on abbotts land or even been across the
wire he felt as he supposed a man must
feel entering a foreign land alone lonely
a little tickly along the spine

  and what good would it all do he might
get his steers back but that wasnt his reason
for this trip he knew he wasnt going so
he could wipe the scorn out of worth hy-
singers eyes or out of his own mind wher-
ever it was no he was going for a bigger
reason than that-to try to stop the killings
on this ranch

  shucks he thought dont be heroic
fm goin i suppose because i know noone
gill and his killers will get me anyhow
sooner or later-unless i can get them first-
because they think al tyle told me too
much

  he rode diagonally away from the fence
to arrive at a mesquite flat two or three miles
inland from the hole where his steers had
entered the abbott land a waning moon was
up when he reached the scattered thickets
he had timed himself for this he rode back
and forth for a while eyes and ears tense for
any sound or sight of man or beast and
heard and saw nothing

at daybreak he was ten or twelve
miles inland not a house or any
smoke or a rider was to be seen in all the
gray expanse of dawn at a little trickle
spring he frizzled bacon on a stick over a
practically smokeless fire and ate it between
cold biscuits then he rode on farther in
keeping to a brushy creek

  at noon he slept for two hours relaxing
completely afterward he rode into a scatter-
ment of little hills winding here and there to
keep from skylining himself now and then
he climbed on foot to a low rocky summit for
a wide conning of the country to get the lay
of the land no houses no riders were to be
seen but here and there whitefaced cattle
grazed he was used to silence in riding his
own land but here the stillness in the warm
november afternoon seemed deeper than any
he had ever known

  a feeling came to him that he was not
making any headway in his search for the
secrets of the greaf ranch he felt futile

in the midst of this he turned out of the hills
unexpectedly-and without warning came
upon a scene that stopped him and his good
bay horse flatfooted

  before him were cattle scattered around a
windmill and a circular cement water tank
chunks of rock salt lay about-a cattle lick
and beyond the cattle were two men on
horseback

  the men saw him almost as soon as he saw
them they came riding around the herd
watching him intently he nudged the bay to
meet them

chapter v
mr half-and-half

he men ward nickerson
had so unexpectedly en-
counted carried rifles
in saddle scabbards and
revolvers at their belts
before they met ward
could see metal disks or
badges pinned n their
shirts

hi one of the pair
greeted whore you
new man on the
ranch said ward
wheres yore badge the man challenged
they drew up close enough for ward to
read the metal disks they wore on one was
foreman no  abbotts rod-and-compass
ranch on the other was range rider
no  abbotts rod-and-compass ranch
why said ward running thumb and
finger along the lapel of his unbuttoned vest
and looking down in pretended surprise i
must have lost it

  when he looked up their six-guns were
leveling at him with stem faces behind
them

  trespassin uh said the range rider

  for the third time in recent days ward
nickerson knew there was no use in beating
around the bush or denying the truth

  yes he said

  whered yuh get in demanded foreman
no 

  north side

  cut the wire

  let it down and put it back

  what yuh after prodded the range rider
id like to buy this ranch from warren
abbott ward said casually and the fore-
man laughed shortly

  a lot of jaspers would he said but they
hated wire	

iint got the dinero you a pinkerton or some
other law mister

  im not a law ward shrugged

 what are yuh

  just let it stand as trespasser

 get down feller came a peremptory
order then

 ward wondered if this was to be the
moment of his disposal the two men took his
rifle and six-gun and searched thoroughly
for further arms then

  yuhll have to ride in to number six with
us the range rider said then foller mol-
ler here and ill be right on yore heels

  it was close to sundown when they arrived
at a neat setting of adobe buildings and rail
pens on a board with the burned rod-and-
compass brand was the designation sub-
division no  a mexican man and woman
and six or eight children were around the
woman served supper

  there was little talk through the short
evening the three men slept in the same
room all guns were left out of the room
the range rider shoved his half-bed against
the door the foreman moller slept against
the window and ward against a blank wall

 they were up at daybreak the range
rider gulped his breakfast and said he had
to finish his round of fences and water-holes

  ill be back early in the afternoon he
told ward and drift yuh on towards the big
headquarters what mr abbott and noone
gill will do for yuh will be plenty

  as soon as he was out of the house moller
who had said practically nothing so far this
morning commented

  its always a relief when the police are
gone they can be pretty gruff

  police ward echoed

 oh thats what most of us call them
range riders their job is to look after fences
and water-holes and windmills and bogged
cattle if any and keep an eye out for tres-
passers and such like and grass fires-just
spies in general on all the rest of us mr
abbott keeps close tabs on his people its
such a big outfit he has to him and his
superintendent arthur blaine are shore
tough on trespassers but yuh cant blame
mr abbott he inherited the spread from
his granddad and his dad calls it the law of
the medes and persians the way he handles
trespassers-he never lets em off

  sounds as if it will go rough with me
ward commented

  foreman moller dawdled with his coffee
relit his cigarette before he spoke again
yuhre not an ordinary trespasser-er-

nickerson did yuh say yore name was he
said then im curious enough to ask what
yuhre after 

  ward thoughtfully flicked his cigarette butt
into the fireplace

  moller he said yuh seem to me to be
an honest and fair-dealin man ill speak my
piece i want to know what happened to
buddy hysinger and the four other fellows
who have vanished inside the abbott wire in
the last six years

  five vanished moller asked in surprise
i never heard of but three and ive been
inside abbotts wire ten years way back
yonder it was a feller named leeks just a
plain rustler i always heard he got his in a
plain shoot-out then couple of years ago a
feller named signalman or singleton or
somethin like that and a few months ago
the young feller yuh named-hysinger
what happened to hysinger

  moller shook his head yuhve scraped the
bottom of the barrel with me nickerson i
dont know the talk was hed just dis-
appeared how come yuh happen in here just
at this time

ard gave him the whole set-up
much as he had told albert tyle in
the back room of the saloon in town only
now he finished with the apparent attempt
of dakin and hyatt to kill him and hyatts
death in a street gun fight in the night

  so lee hyatt got his said moller not
much loss him and dakin have been settin
in close with chief gill the rest of the
riders aint got no use for the three of em
jealous mebbe or think gill is playin
favorites they dont like gill nohow
why

  oh noone gill is strong for number
one moller said always around mr ab-
bott always takin care of his own job first
if anything goes wrong he lays it on to some
of his men wurgler-thats the rider that
just left-he mutters and grumbles about gill
everytime i see him once he said it looked
like gill had a man hid in the brush to spy
on the riders said that feller tyle yuh
mentioned got out because he was scared
plumb yeller seemed like wurgler meant
scared by the feller in the brush which may
all be fool talk

  moller got up paused with his back to the
fireplace looking uncertain

  nickerson he said i dont know just
what to do with yuh me and the mexican
have got to get out on the range workin
beef for the fall market reckon ill have to
	exciting western

leave yuh here may get it from mr abbott
for doin it but anyhow yuhre wurglers
job not mine if i leave yuh will yuh run

off

  might said ward with a quick grin

  moller scratched a leg uneasily tell yuh
a little more nickerson that man single-
mann and yore friend hysinger they was
both bein held at sub-divisions they both
wandered off or got away somehow-and
disappeared thats a little likker gab wurg-
ler handed me once when he was moren
usual mad at noone gill mebbe yuh better
just stick around here nickerson till wurg-
ler gets back

  mebbe said ward and with that half-
assurance the foreman left the house

  as soon as moller and his mexican rode
off ward began a search for his guns he
found them finally under a mattress in a
bedroom-wurglers work probably they
were still loaded and undamaged

  ward returned to the main room where he
had seen a map on the wall it was a blue-
print excellently done in a wooden frame
and about four by six feet it showed what
ward supposed was the entire abbott ranch
-mountains and creeks springs and wind-
mills the outer boundary fence and inner
fences roads and had the sub-divisions all
numbered

  with his eyes ward traced his route to
number  across three roads two fences
using the scale of miles he measured with a
straw and found that he was inside the wire
from his own ranch a distance of twenty-
three miles and he was thirty-seven miles
from abbotts headquarters

  ten or twelve miles southwest of where he
stood at no  was a patch marked rough
badlands the only such marking on the
blueprint in smaller lettering that he al-
most missed in the shadowy room was a
notation scant grazing-too rough for
cattle

  with his guns ward wandered outside
the mexican woman and several children
watched him in indian silence he made a
circuit of buildings and pens noting that his
horse was in a pen he tramped out a quarter
of a mile and made a wider circle of the
place

  was he being watched by some hidden
gunman was this the method of making
men disappear every step was ticklish at
the last where he was in scattered brush
but he saw no human being he did find
three trails though junning off into lone-
some brush country one led southwest but

its dust-dryness showed no tracks other than
the cloven hoofprints of cattle

  ward returned to the pens saddled and
rode into the southwest trail toward the
region labeled rough badlands it might
be as likely a place as any to go

  through the long day ward rode stealthily
carefully hearing and eyes sharpened like a
prowling wolfs watching his horses ears to
locate sounds that his own ears could not
pick up he spent the gloomy night without
fire in a juniper thicket at the edge of what
he supposed must be the rough badlands

  the last of his cold biscuits and bacon was
consumed for breakfast he rode on then
with the futility of his task multiplied ten-
fold in his mind but an unaccountable urge
drove him to go on and on into the region of
scant grazing that was too rough for cattle
to see to make certain-to make certain

  he had gone possibly a mile on the dim and
unused trail when he saw another trail com-
ing into it it came like a shock that other
trail like a surprise visitor where no visitor
should be

  then he saw the tracks of a horse shod
prints going his way he got down to make
sure and as he squatted a voice spoke

  sufferin horn toads nickerson

  a stones flip away peering around a bend
in the narrow trail was albert tyle his
rifle was pointing and his finger was on the
trigger

  good glory he breathed i all but shot
yuh i thought yuh was-

  was what ward asked surprised him-
self that he said what instead of who

  well tyle was looking as if be meant what
something not a man

  what yuh doin here tyle he wanted
to know

tyle lowered his rifle let the hammer
down carefully and came forward three
or four steps ward met him tyle put out
his hand and ward shook with him tyles
face was pinched with fear or alarm and his
body was trembling slightly

  i thought-

  he got no further for a scream like a pan-
thers broke in and a body came dropping
from a rock above them

  both ward and tyle so close together in
the handshake went down under the crush-
ing weight ward rolled to a terrific blow on
his cheek he heard a thud heard tyle
grunt then he was being clawed as if by a
cougar knew his gun was being taken and
he couldnt prevent it then he was no
hated

longer being wolfed

  he sat up in the same instant some-
thing lifted away from tyles body with
tyles rifle and revolver as well as wards
belt-gun

  the something was a man big and thick-
muscled hairy and bareheaded also bare of
feet but wearing ragged levis and shirt he
was making throaty sounds that evidently
were meant for the laughter of triumph
tyle sat up badly shaken but unexpectedly
his terror had changed to boiling wrath

  mr nickerson he flung out contemptu-
ously meet mr half-and-half

  half and half what ward asked staring
incredulously at the great muscled shoulders
that looked as if they could have held up a
world

  half american half mexican his pa was
old flickerweed

  the ragged giant stepped away moving
toward wards horse he smelled of wood
smoke and sweat and the lair of a beast
the horse began to give back snorting then
turned to bolt with an astonishing leap the
man had the reins he yanked wards rifle
from its scabbard and kicked the horse with
his bare foot sending it leaping in fright
toward the two men ward caught the flying
reins

  the giant with two rifles and two revolv-
ers under his arm made shooing motions
with his free hand

  he means for us to go on said tyle he
ran spikka da mex if he wants to but usually
hes too contrary

  tyle led his horse from the brush when
both of them were mounted the little man
started up the trail ward and the hairy
monster following

  flickerweeds son ward questioned
blankly

  enoch flicker tyle explained back over
his shoulder he was head ranch guard and
rustler-killer for warren abbotts pa way
back yonder he was old when he married a
mexican woman and whelped this cur
flickerweed as they called him was big but
this wolf is bigger so they say i never saw
flickerweed

  is this gorilla the answer to-things
ward asked

  hes the answer tyle said drearily
hes gills brush ghost

  yuh mean to say gill uses him to do his
killin for him

  not exactly the mexican law is layin
for half-and-half our lawd be layin for
him too if they knew what i know and what

wire	

gill and tom dakin know yeah and what
lee hyatt knew before i killed him back
yonder half he donttiare get far from this
hideout but he roams he haunts the ranch
nobody ever sees him he can hide like a
wild steer

  he spies on the range riders and fore-
men watches for trespassers chatters what
he sees to noone gill noone likes his job
somethin awful half-and-half helps him
keep it gill pays him with feed and cloes
and a little ammunition gill didnt aim for
half to kill lem singleton and the hysinger
boy that was yuh might say a slip-up
he killed buddy hysinger ward asked
wanting it in plain words

  yes yes but dont talk about it tyle
was getting shrill i saw it twisted whew
he mighty nigh grabbed me too

  tyle choked and his small body shook un-
controllably ward waited for him to get
collected

  where does he think hes takin us now
he asked then

  up to his look-out his cave where he
dens up he like to take his catches there
same as a housecat takes in the chipmunk
its killed

  ward breathed craned his neck to look
at the ranch roamer the giant was just
stopping looking back along the trail his
great dirty hand at his ear he lifted his
flaring nostrils and sniffed the breeze then
whipped around at ward and tyle with
glittering suspicious eyes he saw them
sitting their saddles showing nothing more
than curiosity at his actions and turned back
to look and listen and smell the air

  hes heard somethin muttered tyle
half-and-half shooed them on again with
some urgency now

 move-move-go on he ordered in
mexican

  the path was twisting and climbing the
horses were laboring then the trail split
unexpectedly tyle thumbed toward it and
said it went around the head of a canyon

  immediately the track they were on fell
away on the left ward saw that the giant
stopped again listening with both hands to
his ears the guns held against his ribs with
his elbow when he turned on them again
he yelled excitedly

  aeelerar acelerar hurry

  he snatched up a rock and threw it it hit
wards horse the animal jumped and all
but slid off the trail down the pitching slope

  he shore hears somethin said tyle
whon thunderation can be cornin

chapter vi

  retribution

n increasing excite-
ment h a  f - a n d-half
drove them on throwing
rocks growling cursing
monotonously in a gar-
bled lingo the path
widened then they
moved along a ledge
they came to caves
hollowed by time and
wind and frost in the
rocky wall the drop
almost straight down
was a hundred feet ward thought then
swiftly it became two hundred feet down
the talus slopes to the bottom of the canyon
the narrow summit trail showed above them
against the blue sky

  that lets this here wolf out to mexico
said tyle he wont go any farther than
this

  and at once half-and-half called for them
to stop the horses were fearful of the nar-
row shelf half-and-halfs huge smoke-
blackened greasy hands half pulled ward
from saddle tyle jumped down hastily

 half-and-half slapped the trembling
excited horses into a tiny brush cove ges-
tured the men into a cave just high enough
for them to stand and stood with his back to
the opening to keep them in the animal
smell of him was sickening

  the cave was a sound-catcher the giant
no longer listened with hand to ear even
ward began to hear voices dimly and heard
the sounds of horses on the rocky trail
suddenly the hairy rags-and-tatters tossed
all the guns over the cliff ward heard them
clatter far below the giant was almost
dancing in excitement and anger

  ward caught a movement on the opposite
side of the canyon it was no more than a
hundred feet away but was on the morning-
shade side of the deep cut

  riders have gone along that other path
tyle whispered seems like forty of em
altogether whon thunder can they be
rangers after us is all i can think of

  ward made out two or three riders in the
shady brush just as the half-breed snatched
up a stone and flung it with a crazy shout
it flittered in the sunlight clear across the
gash and may have hit  horse for one
squealed

  then a horseman appeared on the ledge

nearly a hundred yards away it was noone
gill he came spurring on at top speed and
began to motion violently as if to send half-
and-half on

  go on you fool he called out in spanish
get going over the top there you accur-
sed ape

  but the ape made no move to flee in-
stead he ran forward a little way shaking his
huge fist at gill

 you bring men here he cried you
bring the law to catch me

  he hurled a rock noone gill dodged it
and yelled again for the giant to run over
the top

  then gill in a wider spot of the ledge
wheeled his horse another rider came into
sight tom dakin

 cuss yuh dakin gill bawled you
showed em the way here you turned
em on me

  not till after yuh told em i killed the hy-
singer button dakin flung back yuh
low-down coward why didnt yuh keep yore
mouth shut

  come on tom gill shouted we can
make it over the top they mustnt see the
ape

  dakin came on in a burst of speed when
he was three or four horse-lengths away
gill lifted his six-gun and fired three times
dakin threw up his arms fell backward from
the saddle of his rearing horse struck the
edge of the ledge and disappeared from sight

  gill dragged his own horse around and
came on shouting for the ape to run but
half-and-half in a mouthing fury trotted
toward gill gill tried to shout orders to the
man but the giant set his right hand against
gills horse his left against the cliff wall and
heaved with his mighty shoulders

  gill and his horse shot off the ledge and
downward out of sight there was a wail-
ing cry a thick thudding sound a rattle of
rocks then startled silence

  the giant came running back ward and
tyle were out of the cave now past half-
and-halfs huge shoulders ward saw an-
other rider coming up the ledge path worth
hysinger he shouted at her but the bulk-
ing body of the half-breed seemed to block-
ade his voice the mans hands were reach-
ing

  hell twist yuh-hell twist yuh tyle
shouted in terror hell break yore back
and throw yuh over

  ward set his back against the sunlit rock
wall half-and-half stopped in front-of him
grimacing in animal hatred ward lifted his
hated wire	

knee shot his right boot out against the man
and shoved

  half-and-half staggered backward one of
his naked feet went over the edge then the
other he dropped but caught with one el-
bow and one hand then he was coming up
again

  a shot sounded from across the canyon
flame lanced faintly in the shade the giant
grunted slowly his holds let go and he
toppled backward and out of sight   

back along the ledge where the trail
branched at the head of the canyon
ward tyle and worth hysinger met moller
the foreman of no  sheriff wallace a
deputy sheriff blaine superintendent of the
great ranch and carlos pompa

  me too said carlos and grinned sheep-
ishly at ward

  finally warren abbott rode slowly up a
rifle across his legs

  lest there be some mistake and wrong
accusations gentlemen he said in his
stuffed-shirt formality it was i who-er-
shot the-ah-animal-man that dakin told
us about to think that old flicker fathered
that thing i had never known he regarded
ward mr nickerson he said i shall
make trespass charges against you in court
it is my law of the medes and persians irre-
vocable

  and im takin you in mr abbott said
sheriff wallace with relish to answer a
charge of murder-shootin that feller

  certainly said abbott a formality we
must all go through with i havent the
faintest apprehension but that the jury will
clear me my shot saved the lives of mr
nickerson no doubt and of the other man-
tyle is it besides the brute-man was a
trespasser on my country

  in town the justice of the peace fined
ward a dollar and remitted the costa- war-
ren abbott used his influence and was quick-
ly tried for murder at a special term of court
he wanted to get it off his mind so he could
go to the cities as was to be expected the
jury found him not guilty without leaving
the box abbott thanked the jurors not
especially for freeing him but with a nod for
spending their time then he turned to ward
who was present as a witness

  mr nickerson i am inneed of a chief
range rider on the jtod-and-compass i
offer you the job practically speaking you
may name your own salary and other emolu-
ments

  it was one of the big surprises of wards
life a train of thought started up to be
next to the superintendent in pay and im-
portance on the great rod-and-compass
ranch to be associated with warren abbott
and his empire and the fame of it such as
it was and a lifetime job

  ward looked around and met worth hy-
singers gray eyes they were neither nega-
tive nor affirmative but just steady

  ward turned back to the big waiting
ranchman he shook his head

  reckon not abbott ive got my own
little ranch to look after and im takin over
the management of the hysinger place
theyll take all my time and anyhow id
rather be outside the wire

  ward and worth rode home together
albert tyle was with them ward told her
he was hiring tyle to work on the hysinger
place

  only said the little man i aim to go
back to that town and clear myself with the
law about shootin lee hyatt it was in self-
defense he fired first

  i can swear to that said ward

  just want to have a clean record said

mahogany i saw the loose talus rock cover

nodded

  im glad to know she said gently she
looked at the long wire stretching through
the country glittering and winking in the
sunlight i wont hate it so much now she
said since abbott wasnt exactly to blame
about buddy

  and when she looked around at ward he
knew that the scorn was gone from her eyes
or from his own imagination if that was
where it had been all the time

the cowman saw whitey sloan blinking his eyes in the glare of light

 old timer

by stephen payne

veteran ranchman whitey sloan thought hed try farmin
stuff but you cant teach an old cow dog new tricks

whitey sloan known as the old
timer on the  x outfits range
had rehearsed what he was going
to say to the boss but somehow when he was
alone with bill dawson in the small office the
words stuck in his throat whitey had worked
for this grand old man so many years that all
his interests in life were tied up with dawson
and the  x breaking away was-well
heaps toughern he figured

  he shifted from one booted foot to the

other fingered his thin gray mustache
tugged his droopy old hat down on his bald
head and finally fished a letter from the in-
side pocket of his unbuttoned vest and shoved
it at the grizzled ranchman who was regard-
ing him with a sharp and suspicious interest
read it its the second one ive got from
ol jim the first set me thinkin jims got
the right idea this one sort of clinched it
bill dawson scanned the letter and quoted
from it


old timer	

  im living with my daughter her husband
and their kids on a little farm and its sure
an old mans dream youd love it whitey
like i do and im hoping youll buy in with
me

  this jim anson was a riding partner of
yours in the old days the ranchman in-
quired

  thats right bill in them good old days
even before i met up with you whiteys
eyes of washed-out blue were suddenly
bright sa-ay lemme tell you some of the
things me and jim went through together
when we was wild young punchers

  another time youre planning to settle
down with jim on a farm on a farm

  the pretty speech whitey had planned was
lost as completely as a bronc rider with a
loose saddle

 why yes he stammered you see a
mans jus got to stop a-workin for wages
and pitch a camp of his own some day

 he squirmed uncomfortably for he had
helped dawson build up the  x from scratch
and now bill dawsons piercing eyes were
hard to meet

  theres been lots of talk lately about old
men knocking off to take it easy  a smile
creased the comers of the old mans firm
mouth as if that was the smart thing for
em to do

  thats right whitey agreed quickly
these yearlings im workin with bill keep
remindin me how ancient im gettin and how
i ought to get a change and some fun before
i kick off that along with ol jims letters
kinda got me not as i really think of my-
self or of jim anson as bein old thirty
years ago he got married and id lost all
track of him till his first letter in it he said
hed lost his wife and had one daughter this
second one told more jim and me used to be
awful close bill

  dawson nodded have you told the boys
youre quitting  x he asked

  no sir whitey said with emphasis i
could take their razzin all right yet itll be a
heap sight simpler if i dodge it curlyd be
slappin his leg and chucklin fit to bust a rib
so cow punchins a dogs life whitey reck-
on theres a heap of dog about you youve
always took to it so strong lot of that sort
of stuff boss if youll give me my wages
ill slip out quiet and youll tell the bunch
so long for me

  dawson frowned before he spoke

  youve got real money coming old timer
and im a bit short so suppose i give you one
thousand dollars now and after i ship some
beef-

  sure whitey agreed bi-iefiy

  some moments latr he pocketed a big roll
of bills and his voice was husky as he
squeezed bill dawsons hand hard turning
he hurried at his rolling stilted cowboy walk
across the dark yard to the stable and led
out his own private saddle horse a leggy
roan

rnknown to the other cowboys and
ranch hands he had earlier packed a
war sack with a few precious items and
cached it in a manger he reti-ieved the sack
and tied it in front of his outmoded saddle
behind which slicker and coat were tied
with a queer lump in his scrawny throat and
a mist in his eyes he somehow could not wipe
away with his bandanna he swung up and
prodded the roan out of the  x yard

  doggone if it wasnt for ol jim beggin
me to come join him i couldnt cut er hes
plumb right though feller my age is bout
through got to have a little campin spot he
can call his own home

  the silent stars that had winked under-
standing upon the old hand on a thousand
different nights while he circled around a
bedded herd now looked austerely on the
slouch hat and warped shoulders and bat
wing chaps of the man riding away from the
ranch and range he loved

  the stars were still bright when he took
the indian trail over the great mountain
range some day a highway would run here
but now it was nothing more than a game
and pack horse trail yet one to shorten
whiteys long journey to what he called the
valley by fifty miles

  by sundown of the next day he had put
the smell of wild flowers and of pines be-
hind him he had put the mountains be-
hind him and all of the terrain had changed
here the road ran between wire fences and
plowed fields rolled away to right and left

  he saw small bands of sheep and more
hogs and chickens than hed imagined were
in the whole world he smelled alfalfa and
fruit orchards and there was a strangeness
about the neat frame buildings too darned
civilized and what a gosh awful lot of them

  the horses were all big work teams fat
and strong and quite unlike the cayuses cow-
men used for saddle stock the cattle small
dairy herds all right in their way and neces-
sary too but to a fellow who never milked
a cow if he could avoid it and had wrangled
the wild texas cattle long years ago and then
had seen them grow into the fine beef herds
dairy cows just werent real cattle

  at dusk he rode into the town of valley
	exciting

following its main street he felt eyes both of
pedestrians and of farmers in buggies and
wagons and automobiles heavy on him it
was as if he was a curiosity something out
of the past like an ox team and covered
wagon like a herd of buffalo like a mountain
trapper like-why like a cowpuncher of the
old trail-driving days-a survivor of an era-
which in this fertile land was gone forever

  at home he hadnt felt out of place or out
of time but here he felt acutely self-con-
scious he didnt belong

  the roan turned in at a livery stable where
the chubby young hostler gave horse and
rider a long appraising stare

  when you get done gawkin tell me
where-ats jim ansons place whitey said
annoyed

  anson oh hes the old grandpa who
lives with tom calloway lets see now
where is calloways farm you better stay
here tonight and hunt it up by daylight

  reckon i had whitey agreed and
under his breath i got to get used to this
and make new friends

  however when he left town soon after sun-
rise he still felt as lost as a lone steer on a
sheep range he had known this lower
country would be warmer than the moun-
tains but he hadnt expected the heat to sort
of wrap itself round him the air too
seemed to have absorbed all the smells of
growing things and to rest heavily on the
man and his horse

  nevertheless anticipation brightened his
leathery face when at last he turned off the
road through a wire gate to a set of build-
ings bordered by shade trees in the back-
ground was an apple and cherry orchard and
there were chicken houses and hog pens a
huge bam and sho nuff a herd of milk
cows grazing in a pasture whitey sloan
would have called a good-sized corral

  the frame house had recently been painted
so its white walls and red roof looked mighty
neat a tawny cat fuzzed its tail and scuttled
out of sight as if the old timer and his horse
were enemies and a little girl stopped her
play with her small brother to stare at him
as if he was something from a story book
which she hadnt actually believed real until
now

  hi kids wheres your grandpa it
wouldnt be long now before he saw old jim

  hes laying down the girl said

  whats that said whitey very sharply
how come

  a young woman with something white
bound around her dark hair came from the
cherry orchard she was a right well set-up

western

girl with pink cheeks and nice blua ayes and
she carried two large basket of cherries aa
easily as if shed been a man

  she looked at the cowman with patent
astonishment as he swung down a bit stiffly
and advanced with his dust-coated hat in his
hand

  i take it youre june calloway

  im mrs calloway the woman said
briefly as if to set this stranger in his place

  a little of whiteys warmth and joy at
meeting jims daughter went out of him but
his grin didnt vanish

  happens im your daddys old time part-
ner mrs calloway youve heard him talk
about whitey sloan

  oh whitey talk about you i should
say he does hes been hoping youd come
youll find him in through the living room
first door to your right but dont excite
him

hitey shuffled into the house turned
through the door at his right and
stopped and stared wide-eyed at the rather
fleshy man stretched out on a bed in a tiny
airless room the mans eyes were closed
he was white-haired and his furrowed old
face had an unnatural color as if he stayed
too much indoors jim anson all right but
gosh hed changed whitey had been re-
membering him as of thirty-odd years ago
now shock ran through him and left him
strangely disturbed

  jims eyes flicked open and he bounced off
the bed

  whitey he yelled you thunderin old
hoss thief am i glad to see you put er
there

  same here how you makin out you
long-horned son of a coyote

  for three minutes they loudly insulted one
another and then whitey asked what you
layin round this way for

  aw just off my feed a little ill be hunky
now how you like this place look through
this window you can see the mountains and
its so quiet just the place for us to settle
down in our old age

  june calloways shadow darkened the door
daddy her troubled voice warned you
mustnt get excited

  heck stop worritin about what that pill-
pusher said june now whiteys here im
rarin to go lets put your horse in the barn
and ill show you round

  and with the enthusiasm of a youthful
cowboy showing off his new saddle to his
comrades jim anson showed his old friend
the farm alfalfa here small grains there
old timer	

vegetables yonder and of course whitey had
noticed the berry bushes and fruit trees

  tom calloway had bought in with jim
when tom married june nigh six years ago
tom was sure a hustler today he was help-
ing a neighbor so he in turn would get help
harvesting alfalfa but hed be home come
evenin three years back the grasshoppers
had eaten everything on the farm every
danged thing and was that a socker it had
put em in debt all over again

  now thats just like the cow business
said whitey a feller thinks hes got it
made then comes a hard winter or a drought
or-

  yeh yeh jim agreed and with glowing
pride he showed whitey the chickens and
the hogs and the dairy herd whitey pre-
tending an interest he simply didnt and
couldnt feel not yet anyhow

  the men had been closely tagged by the
two small children myrtle and tiny jimmy
their big-eyed wonder and curiosity about
the queer dressed odd-looking visitor had
soon worn off as well as their awe of him
by the time they were turning back to the
house for dinner whitey had myrtles hand
fast in his and jimmy was perched on his
shoulder

  the meal over june looking still more
worried strongly advised her father to rest
jim anson would have none of it

  you want the cherries taken to town
well me and whitey take them in and sell
them take that dry cow which aint any
good and sell her to the butcher too

  the two men hitched a team to a light
spring wagon and loaded in it the cherries
some garden truck and dozens of eggs

  ill get my horse and haze the beef herd
long behind your grub wagon jim whitey
chuckled

  grub wagon hi ive nigh forgot range
stuff been away from it so long wherell
we camp tnight old timer looks like id
have to be the pilot as well as the cook

  and me the horse jingler as well as the
cowpunchin crew whitey laughed reckon
i can handle that big herd of one cow

  not on horseback said jim and poked
the other in the short ribs that old bossy
never seen a cowpuncher on a horse shed
balk and you couldnt drive her no place
well lead her behind the wagon

  you mean it jim whitey asked blankly

  jim did and presently they were on the
way with the haltered old holstein trailing
behind the rig

  wonder what the  x boys and bill daw-
sond think if theyd see me now whitey

mused salty jerky how- theyd hoorah
me

  the trip was something novel and he really
enjoyed every part of this new adventure
except meeting -jctor harney who ex-
hibited deep concern in seeing jim anson
cavorting around like a young man

  see here whatever your name is
harney said confronting whitey ansons
got to take care of himself

  his tone riled the easy-going old cowhand
bet you hes happiern hes been in years
shuckins doc layin round and imaginin
hes sickd sure kill him

  i can see youre a tough old ranger who
wouldnt understand but didnt mrs callo-
way tell you that her fathers heart-
bunk snorted whitey his hearts in
the right place if thats what you mean
as if to prove junes and the doctors worry
unfounded in the days that immediately
followed jim anson continued to astonish
his daughter with renewed vitality and zest
for life

  your being here is the best tonic imagin-
able for dad june admitted to whitey
such wonderful plans hes making for the
future-with you

but whitey soon became aware that
jims son-in-law tom calloway did
not share their glowing plans the old hand
had been eager to make friends with the
young farmer only to discover that they had
nothing in common and never would savvy
one another but smoky hills how tom
could turn off the work

  except in caring for the horses whitey had
no enthusiasm for this sort of work though
he wasnt telling his friend how thoroughly
he disliked it one afternoon when the two
oldsters were spraying fruit trees and berry
bushes whitey tried to make a game of it

  you say they got some kind of bugs
like lice or ticks or scab on cows eh well
indicating a small apple tree heres a
mangy yearlin with his hoofs bogged in the
mud so we cant haze him through the dip-
pin vat bring up your spray gun jim and
well douse him right here hey now look
out he dont hook you

  jim anson failed to warm up to the game
 hook you cant you think of nothin
but cows and hosses whitey

  uh seems youre most as wrapped up
in this farm work as tom and sa-ay seems
to me tom and june never stop workin and
never never get through

  what of it whitey the chores must be
done before breakfast and after supper and
	exciting

june has to patch and darn and make clothes
for the kids whenever she gets a minute
besides

ye-ah drily i thought id seen ranch
women chained to jobs but i hadnt seen
nothin dont june never get any fun or-
jim straightened from pumping the spray
gun gazed toward the neat house

  well he said me and tom figured she
was titled to a nice home so we got that
shack worked over and painted this spring
he snapped his fingers with annoyance a
mistake when we didnt have the dough we
borrowed a thousand bucks from a neighbor
roy dagwell on a demand note now hes
howlin for it and threatenin to put an at-
tachment on everything thats loose

  what the dickens exclaimed whitey
not as there is much loose jim went on
with sudden rancor on account of them
tough years theres a big plaster on this
place and stock that dagwell debt sorta
eats on june makes her keep a-humping to
gather every egg and every cherry and-
jim whitey interrupted impulsively
happens i can take this dagwell off your
necks money never meant a lot to me
cause i never needed much of anything for
myself you take this roll and-

  no we- i couldnt take- we got pride
aint we forget it old horse

  keep your shirt on jim remember you
mentioned me buyin in with you

  uh-huh now i had an idea if we raised
enough grain and hay this year wed feed a
bunch of lambs you to buy em whitey
thunderation jim you mean steers dont
you id get a kick out of feedin young
steers but sheep you sure have got a long
way off the trail for an ol cowman

  more money in sheep feedin stated jim
doggedly and then eagerly how you likin
it whitey reckon you can plant yourself
here and be happy like me

  sure jim sure agreed whitey but al-
though he was honestly trying to fit himself
into this new life he simply could not wipe
his old interests out of mind

  about now he ought to be drifting the
young  x steers off the flats and back up
into the hills yes and throwing the cows
and calves on the forest reserve how were
the yearling heifers on blue fork doing
getting late for poison weed to be dangerous
yet a fellow ought to be keeping an eye on
it in many different spots on the  x far-
flung range

  who the sam hill was filling his boots
right now doggone i whoever was taking
over his job would get his string of saddle

western

ponies jarred on a man something terrible
just to think of some other geezer riding his
pet horses

  at dusk of the next day he was dawdling
at the stable for a few moments after feeding
and watering the farm horses and his own
roan when he heard voices in the nearby
cow barn where tom calloway was milking
but dagwell we cant pay you

  im going to get tough if you dont tom
dagwell sounded belligerent

  aw lay off me tom retorted cant
you see ive got an awful load interest and
taxes and grub bills and the old man to
take care of

  yeh said dagwell yet i seen jim
busyin himself a heap lately whos the
other old freak

  whitey sloan doubled his right fist
  old freak

  friend of jims said tom and though
i dont want to beef its jims fault that
june and me have got that old pensioner
boarding on us hes no darned good at farm
work and never will be

   pensioner boarding on us  whitey
gritted doggone his hide ill-no i wont
punchin his nosed make things heaps
worse

silently he moved away from the
stable and on to the house it was the
hour for his customary gab fest with old
jim when eyes aglow they relived adven-
tures of long ago but tonight jim anson had
put himself to bed and judging from his low
moans he seemed to be in pain

  matter old head whitey asked solicit-
ously bending closer he added dont you
know me	

  sure mumbled jim yet whitey realized
his mind was far from clear

  with a sudden happy idea taking shape in
his own mind the old hand got a tablet of
paper and a pencil

  little somethin i want you to put down
on paper just like i tell it to you jim

  the mans hand shook a good deal as he
wrote what whitey dictated and eventually
signed his name

  know what you said jim whitey asked
when he had the tablet again

  eumnn jim mumbled let me feel
your hand whitey you member that black
night when you and me was tryin to-to-
its like that now darj awful dark

  the voice trailed off ated whitey felt jims
hand go limp in his a lump welled in his
throat choking him and then he heard
myrtle at the door
old timer



  grandpa asleep uncle whitey she
asked

  asleep yes honey hes asleep hell
sleep a long long time spose you go call
your mama while i make talk on the tele-
phone though what good the doc can do is
moren i know

  three days later whitey saddled his roan
and tied his war sack in front of his saddle
then he stopped and gathered jimmy and
myrtle one in each arm they were tearful
now not because grandpa was gone but be-
cause they knew uncle whitey was leaving
them and the farm

  see what ive got for you soothed the
old hand boy-size quirt i braided myself
for you jimmy braided belt thatll just fit
you myrtle

  the children were finding joy in these
wonderful presents when june calloway
walked over to whitey and his horse she
was dabbing at her eyes and she had trouble
with her voice as she began to speak

  i cant begin to thank you for all you did
for dad those last days of his life im sorry
too that tom and i were so busy we didnt
seem to have time to be friendly is it too
late to tell you that you helped me helped
me so much

  whitey held out his hand to june

  im mighty glad if i was of some use
nothin turned out like jim and me figured
yet maybeso thingsll be a mite easier for
you from now on june

  oh they will whitey they will you
see daddy gave us the nicest surprise
among his things was a note hed written
saying hed been holding out some money for
an emergency a cache he called it the
note told where wed find it buried in a tin
can

  well i never exclaimed whitey jus
like good ol jim fifty sixty dollars may-
be

  youll be surprised too dad left us nine
hundred dollars almost enough to pay off
dagwell

  i know how you and tom want to get
that skinner off your necks june so take
this hundred bucks yes you must take it

and let it halfway pay for my board and
keep i never really yarned good-by and
good luck

  he stepped spryly into his saddle and
kicked the roan into a lope

  bill dawson was a night owl at one
oclock in the morning he was in his den
reading a mystery story when somebody
rapped softly and he heard hi bill

  the cowman opened his door and saw
whitey sloan blinking his washed-out eyes
in the glare of light there was the dust of
a long trail on him and his weariness some-
what dimmed the eagerness and the glow of
anticipation on his lined old face

  dawson indicated a chair and chuckled
inaudibly before he said i thought youd
pulled up stakes for good old timer

  well well stammered whitey and then
blurted you see bill ol jim cashed in and
i couldnt go that farmin stuff without him
so i-so i-

  sorry to hear about jim bill dawson
said and waited for the cowhand to go on

  so i said whitey desperately dropped
back here just to-to tell whoever you put
in my place some things about the range and
the cattle that a new man had ought to
savvy

  the ranchmans eyes were twinkling as
he nodded

  thats fine youve got some new plans
for yourself whitey

  we- we- sure im figurin to-bill
whos fillin my boots here on x

  dawson couldnt go on with the game he
clapped a hand on the knotty old timers
shoulder

  nobody and nobodys thrown a saddle
on one of your string of ponies

  nobody echoed whitey eyes and face
lighting nobody joy lifted his voice
bill does that mean-

  it means exactly what you think it does
i knew youd be back

  uh old socks you couldnt have knowed
that not for sure nohow

  not for sure dawson was laughing at
him whitey you cant teach an old dawg

had a word

ip it

by chuck stanley

one day the pilgrim strolled down
from the bunkhouse for another gab
session with the old maverick and
was surprised to find that the mossy-horn
was lively and chipper instead of meeting
him on the porch of his little shack the old-
timer was leaning against the pole corral and
saying

  son i figger ive been riding the hurricane
deck of a rocking chair just about long
enough today i scheduled a palaver on
some of the wildflowers and trees of this
here southwest country and i reckon the
best way to show you what i mean is to
fork a bronc and hit out onto the prairie
most folks figure theres nothing colorful or
poetic about sage and cactus but i hope to
confound them unbelievers

nature at first hand

  the young tenderfoot was eager to learn
about the beauties of nature at first hand
and under the guidance of such an ex-
perienced teacher particularly since this was
one side of the cowboy lexicon of words that
he had not even scratched

  they rigged a couple of easy-going ani-
mals and were soon putting out of the ranch
yard and moving acioss the home graze
toward the stretches of prairie and desert
beyond when they were well away from the
buildings and surrounded by the growth of
the range the old-timer began

  most folks speak about the cactus coun-
try as though it were a desert but if youre
a clever range rider or desert rat you can
often made the cactus country take care of
you

 the cow-country patriarch pointed out a
 prickly pear cactus and they paused so

that the arbuckle could examine it the
prickly pear is sometimes known as the
indian fig and like the fruit of a good many
cacti can be used as a food most of you
easterners are familiar with the prickly
pear cactus because its the one people have
a habit of planting in a bowl of sand or
pebbles and sticking in the kitchen window

  the pilgrim was delighted with this infor-
mation but amazed when he learned that
there were about two hundred and fifty
species of prickly pear he was more than
surprised too to discover that the plants
produced interesting yellowish and reddish
yellow flowers

the hedge-hog cactus

  his attention was next called to a round
cactus with many spines sticking out at all
angles and with yellow and rose flowers
on the top	

  got a name for that asked the old-
timer

  looks like a pineapple to me laughed the
tenderfoot

  thats pretty close agreed the mossy-
horn but the waddies call it hedge-hog
cactus if youve run into any of them little

our pilgrim learns the lore of prairie trees
the cowboy had

animals youll recognize the connection
there are eight or nine types of hedge-
hog for your horse to run into or spill you
onto depending on the calibre of your rid-
ing the range mentor chuckled

named according to shapes

  the young pilgrim then learned that a
good many of the cactus plants described in
the natural history books by long latin
names derived their western popular de-
scriptions from the shapes they took

  one of the more familiar of these was the
barrel cactus which was shaped something
like a beer barrel and the liquid that could
be squeezed from the pulp inside often meant
the difference between life and death to wad-
dies lost in the desert

  another colorful cactus plant was the so-
called organ cactus which sent up twenty
or thirty trunks of varying heights and
widths from a single base with the result
that the full-grown plant looked like a
church organ with its varied pipes

  whats that tall tree over there asked
the arbuckle as they resumed their riding

  thats a mesquite replied the old-timer
most folks think that a mesquite is a little
scrubby thing and most times it is but you

homey afesqute <-> fows to height of et

let one of them trees stick its roots down into
wet ground like along some of the big rivers
in texas new mexico and arizona and itll
shoot up to fifty or sixty feet youve heard
tell of how them meat packers in chicago
can get everything out of the pig but its
squeal when they go into the slaughter-
house well i reckon this here mesquite is
just about the same to the mexicans and in-
dians in the southwest

  the old-timer then went on to explain how
the tree was called the honey pod after the
long seed cases from four to nine inches in
length which supplied the popular mesquite
beans these were the important raw ma-
terials that often went into the famous mexi-
can frijoles or other bean dishes

mesquite shoots

  early in the spring range cattle frequent-
ly fed oa mesquite shoots the young ten-

a word for it	

der green seedings that later turned into
greenish fragrant flowers the mesquite also
supplied fuel and building materials in the
desert

  when a newcomer arrives in the range
country his more experienced neighbor takes
him on a wood-foraging expedition much
of the best wood is in the root system which
often sends dozens of roots down into the
ground as far as sixty- feet in search of water
and when this wood is cut it makes good
building and fencing materials

  many a western community can point to
fence posts railroad ties the corner posts of
adobe houses furniture wooden wheels and
paving blocks that are made of mesquite
roots and the surplus is turned into fire-
wood or charcoal indeed the mesquite is
the cowboys friend

  some of the smaller mesquites are known
as the screw-bean or screw-pod mes-
quites the chief difference is in the shape
of the pod which curls up like a screw how-
ever when it is straightened out it has a
length of from twelve to twenty inches and
twice as many beans as the honey-pod

the palo verde

  the next frontier tree to come to the at-
tention of our two riders was the palo
verde

  our ranch and range student was surprised
to find that this tree was related to the more
familiar acacia and that it was a green-
barked tree with almost no leaves the
leaves were about an inch long and looked
very much like locusts or grasshoppers
crouching against the palo verde for this
reason they were known to the cowboys as
honey-locust leaves

  the tree had beautiful flowers however
which were reminiscent of the little yellow
roses of the east

  another bean-bearing tree that proved in-
teresting to the young arbuckle was the
retama the horses headed for the
retama tree as though it were a giant
magnet and immediately began browsingon
the foliage the fruit was dark orange-
brown in color

texas ebony

  now you know why the waddies call this
tree the horse-bean laughed the old mav-
erick but look-heres an excellent ex-
ample of a texas ebony 

  the elderly range rider spurred his ani-
mal in the direction of the beautiful tree that


exciting western

rose to thirty feet in height along one of the
bluffs lining the river

  the tenderfoot realized that like most other
ebonies this tree supplied wood that was
valuable for fine cabinet work and was al-
most indestructible when it was used as
foundation wood or otherwise came in con-
tact with the ground

  this texas ebony tree sure adds a lot of
variety to the cowboys menu pointed out
the old-timer he has a number of different
names for its products for instance if youre
hankering for some texas string-beans
youll get them on this tree ranch cooks
that are looking for them pick the pods be-
fore theyre fully ripened and boil them like
regular string beans then you can have
texas frijoles which come from the beans
when theyre fully ripened and if you
have your taste set for texas coffee the old
ebony tree will fill the bill too

  how do you figure that asked the
greener

  well explained the mossy-horn these
here panhandle and big bend cocineros
they just roast them beans and grind them up
in a coffee grinder and the brew you get
from them is some of the finest youve ever
tasted

the little bean tree

  the greenhorn reflected on the assets
of the texas ebony and went along to make
the acquaintance of a much smaller tree
nearby this was the frijolito or little
bean tree

  because of the bright scarlet seeds that
were concentrated around the pods the cow-
boys also referred to this representative of
their rangeland as the coral-bean tree
like some of the other trees just visited it
grew best along stream borders

  nearby he discovered a tree with small
apples growing on it and he asked whether
they were good for eating for answer the
old-timer plucked several of the apples and
ate one of them the pilgrim learned that
it was a prairie crabapple tree which was
also known by the name of the soulard
crabapple tree after the man who discovered
it 

  the mentor explained to his ardent young
student that the lives of many of the pioneers
had been made much pleasanter by apple
jellies and preserves made from the fruit of
these trees and their close kin the wild
crabapple tree which grew nearby

for bows and arrows

  a tree that had supplied many plains in-
  dians with the raw materials for their bows

and arrows was the hackberry later on
when the wagon of the pioneer and the cattle
trail driver moved along the indian war
paths the cowboys used the wood for axle-
trees the spokes and naves of wheels and
for making musical instruments

  it was a plumb helpful tree the old-
timer declared and it sure had its other uses
too for instance the waddy had hack-
berry dye from the roots and could use it
to dye his fancy shirts a bright yellow
hackberry tanbark was an important item
in helping to tan the leather for saddles and
stirrups and one way to keep saddles and
boots plenty limber was by using hackberry
oil pressed out of the stones of the fruit

  the young rider was willing to agree that
this tree besides the pleasure it gave merely
by growing in the desert places was a mighty
important range asset

the pinon or nut-pine

  but there was another familiar term he
had heard a number of the waddies use in
the bunkhouse and on the roundup they
spoke of many pinon trees he asked the
old-timer what was meant by that

  the pinon is the nut-pine tree ex-
plained the mossback there are four of
them on both sides of the mexican border
and they are so-called because they supply
the indians and mexicans and our own trap-
pers and ranchers with seeds or nuts that
are rich in oils and have good keeping
qualities that permit storing them through a
winter

  the young tenderfoot dismounted from his
horse and ground-reined the animal while
he leaned against one of the trees and settled
himself to make notes on the various ad-
ditions to the cowboy lexicon coming from
the pinon or nut-pine tree

  he discovered that there was pinon mush
made by pounding the seeds in a stone bowl
and pinon flour which was a finer render-
the cowboy had a word for it



ing of the crushed seeds used for making
pinon cakes

  the lodge pole pine was also an im-
portant member of the pine tree family
declared the old-timer like you know the
indians first used it for building their lodges
or tepees the poles were also known as
travois poles because a pair of them were
used for the indians horse-drawn pack

the useful tamarack

  he went on to explain that the lodge pole
pine of the cowboy and indian is really the
tamarack tree and was so useful for the
indian and also as the raw material for cor-
rals originally built in rounded form be-
cause of the supple trunks of the saplings
which permitted them to be bent into a com-
plete bow without splitting or cracking

  the sun was sinking toward the west as
the pilgrim made his notes on the pine trees
and picked up the dragging reins of his horse
he swung aboard the saddle and reined
around to head for home as he jogged along
the old maverick asked

  what do you think of the kind of trees we
have out here in our cowboy desert a lot
more useful than you figured i reckon
the greenhorn laughed then remarked
from the looks of things the indians the
mexicans and the early settlers here were
able to get about everything they needed out
of a tree or a bush except something to wear
they could build shelters eat the beans
make cakes out of the mash and even
coffee

clothes from trees

  the old-timer puffed on his pipe leaned
comfortably to one side of his saddle then
said

  this here jaunt around among the trees
and flowers has just about begun hombre
but i dont want you to get home tonight
figuring that the injuns couldnt get no
material for clothes out of these trees be-
cause it just aint so

  how do you figure that the pilgrim in-
quired

  well replied the mossy-horn next
trip out were going to look over some of
the wildflowers and things that brighten up
the life of a cowboy and make the cows more
comfortable and contented right then im
going to give you a look at a western juniper
yes-sirree thats a tree they talk about
them redwoods and sequoias out there in
california but well match them right here
in the southwest with our western juniper

a long life-span

  the pilgrim was amazed to learn that while
this tree never grew very tall it did have a
life span of more than two thousand years
and often when most of the tree was ripped
away or denuded by an avalanche a single
root would hold to a soil base and new shoots
would come out with each passing season

  them there trees supply the indians and
some white folks with juniper cloth some
of the trappers and indians call the stringy
bark juniper yarn and it sure works up
into a useful cloth for them who like to use
it of course with the indians not quite as
tough as they used to be maybe this here

juniper cloth aint as stylish as it used to be
but the squaws still like to use it to make
juniper mats and juniper robes out of it
they were nearing the ranch house as the
old-timer concluded lis remarks on the
qualities of the juniper tree and its con-
tribution to the cowboys life and lore and
the arbuckle agreed that his ride had been
definitely interesting and instructive he
was already looking forward to his next jaunt
into the cowboys wildflower paradise

our tenderfoot studies the flowers of the west in

the cowboy had a word for it

  the meanest man

by gunnison steele

sam radd didnt know which was worse-killing the banker
or telling the sherifi that his own partner had done it

sam radd was a tall bony-framed
man who owned a half-interest with
bill tolliver in a little outfit up in the
blacktop hills now as radd rode into the
town of barrier his shoulders were slumped
and there was a worried light in his mild
gray eyes

  as radd came even with the sheriffs office
he glanced through a window and saw sheriff
jard catwicks heavy figure seated at his
scarred desk he started to ride on past
then shook his head somberly and reined in
at the tie-bar his movements were slow and

heavy as he dismounted and entered the
office

  sheriff catwick was a big mustached taci-
turn man he had been scribbling on a piece
of paper but looked up sharply as sam
radd entered

  hello sam he said have a chair

  radd nodded sat down opposite the sheriff
he kept turning his floppy old hat nervously
in his callused hands the worry was plain
on his gray face

  somethin on yore mind sam sheriff
catwick asked
the meanest man	

 sam radd nodded again with obvious
reluctance

  yes there is sheriff he said slowly i
aint slept much for the last three nights

  whats the trouble

 some things a man can run away from
or hide from radd muttered but not
from hisself hes got to live with hisself till
he dies

  well now i reckon thats a plumb fact
the sheriff frowned whatn tunket are yuh
talkin about sam

  about what wont let me sleep about
bill tolliver

 yore pardner yuh mean whats he
done

  it was him that robbed the bank a month
ago and killed old clay farnum sam radd
blurted

  sheriff catwick stiffened staring at the
man before him his eyes narrowed coldly

  yuh shore of that sam he murmured

 sam radd nodded dumb misery in his
eyes

  i wish i wasnt then i wouldnt have to
be doin what im doin i wouldnt have to be
callin myself a low-down blabbin skunk for
turnin my pardner in to the law

  never mind that how yuh know it was
bill tolliver that done it

  radd hesitated turning his hat in his
hands he looked as if he wished bitterly
that he could recall the words he had said

one night a month ago old clay farnum
president of the barrier stockmans
bank had been called to the door of his
small house where he lived alone there a
hooded figure had jabbed a gun at the bank-
er forced him to accompany the hooded man
through the dark streets to the bank then
he had forced farnum to open the bank
vault

  as the hold-up thrust a sheaf of bank-
notes into his shirt the old banker had fool-
ishly attacked him the hooded man had
smashed him to the floor with a blow from
his gun-barrel and then as the old man lay
stunned on the bank floor the bandit had
deliberately fired a shot into his chest

  apparently suddenly gripped by panic the
killer had fled from the bank having taken
only the single bundle of currency farnum
had lived just long enough to tell what had
happened then died he hadnt recognized
the killer furthermore sheriff catwick had
been unable to unearth a single clue

  speak ou sam the sheriff said sharply
what makes yuh think it was bill tolliver
that done it

  the night it happenedradd said slowly
bill was alone at the ranch id gone off
into the hills to look for a bunch of strays
and when night caught me i made camp that
would give bill his chance	

  but its not proof

  im cornin to that a couple of days after
it happened i found this out in the bam
where likely it had been dropped by acci-
dent

  radd dropped a narrow strip of gummed
paper on the desk the paper was stamped
with the words barrier stockmans bank
it had been used the sheriff knew to hold
together a sheaf of bank-notes he thought-
fully jabbed at it with a raencil

  is that all

  no it aint radd said doggedly if it
had been    well bill tolliver was in bed
with fever most of last week he was de-
lirious part of the time and he done consid-
erable talkin i couldnt help hearin what
he said could i i-well dang it he told
just how hed done it robbed the bank and
killed farnum i mean he told where hed
hid the money-under some hay out in the
barn i had to be shore so i went and
looked

  and the money was there

  yeah it was five hundred dollars in
twenty-dollar bills i heard the bank had
down the serial numbers of the money that
was took bill wasnt at the house when i
left this momin so  got one of the bills and
brought it along here it is

  sheriff catwick looked closely at the twen-
ty-dollar bill radd handed him then he
took from a desk drawer a slip of paper with
some figures scrawled on it and compared
the figures with the serial number on the
banknote

  this is part of the bank money all right
he said grimly anything else

  radd shook his head glumly thats all
like i said i thought about it a long time
before i made up my mind what i had to do
me and bill always got along and i never
suspected hed do a thing like that so when
i found out i kind of went all to pieces for a
while likely i wont sleep any better now
than i did before but anyhow ill know i
done my duty

  aint but one way to do-the right way
the sheriff said brusquely and yuhll be in
line for the thousand-dollar reward the bank
offered for the capture and conviction of the
killer

  i hadnt thought about any reward it
was just what was inside me that made me
come here

i
	exciting western

  thats up to you whether yuh want it or
not naturally yuhll have to swear to what
yuh just told me yuh willin to do that

  if i have to

  then ill have a warrant swore out and
go bring bill tolliver in yuh crave to go
along

  id rather not i-i dont know how ill
face bill after all he was my partner no
ill stay here in town

  suit yoreself catwick got to his feet
ought to be back with bill before night
sam radd nodded got up and went out
he slowly crossed to a saloon entered or-
dered a drink he stared morosely into the
glass for a long moment before drinking the
whisky   

it was almost sundown when sheriff
catwick got back to town with bill tol-
liver tolliver was a big dark-faced man
younger than sam radd he rode straight
in the saddle looking with cold contemptu-
ous eyes at those in the street his manacled
hands on the saddle-horn before him that
was the way bill tolliver was-arrogant
confident his bold eyes heaping insolence
upon the world

  radd watched as the sheriff and tolliver
dismounted before the sheriffs office and
went inside then he shook his head again
went out and along the street now that
the unpleasant task was over nothing was to
be gained by evasion or pretense he went
into the sheriffs office

  bill tolliver turned and looked at his
partner he said nothing just stared at
radd his lips curling with contempt a wick-
ed anger in his eyes

  bill radd said slowly i dont expect
yuh to understand what i done

  i understand all right tolliver said
coldly get out of my sight i dont like the
stripes down yore back

 mebbe yuhre right bill radd said
gently without apparent resentment i
dont know which was the meanest-what i
done or what you done

  i know wholl have the most regret
tolliver said i almost feel sorry for yuh
sam

  that radd knew was a threat and bill
tolliver was not the bluffing kind despite
himself sam radd felt a little shiver chase
along his spine he turned and went out
at the tie-rack he mounted his roan and
headed out toward the blacktops that bris-
tled like the hair on a wolfs back along the
northern horizon 

  it was long after nightfall although a full

moon shone brightly when he reached the
circle rt log cabin ranchhouse that huddled
in the shadows of giant pines beside a noisy
little stream the circle rt was not a big
outfit but it had made money for radd and
tolliver many fertile meadows dotted the
timbered foot-hills

  there was just one drawback driven down
from the bleak highlands by a hard winter
packs of hungry savage wolves were roam-
ing the foot-hills in search of food a good
many calves had been lost to the fierce
beasts despite the partners attempts to ex-
terminate them 

  radd had not eaten since morning but he
found that he had small appetite suddenly
remembering that he had neglected to ask
sheriff catwick if he had found the cached
bank money he got up and went to the barn
the money was gone radd sighed deeply
that money was the main piece of evidence
that would put a noose about bill tollivers
neck

  sam radd returned to the ranchhouse he
sat there in the dark for a long time wonder-
ing if he had done the wise thing   

  it was almost noon the next day when
sheriff catwick rode along the dim trail and
stopped before the ranchhouse the lawman
was grim-faced and frowning as he looked
at radd

  yuh stay at home all night sam he
asked abruptly

  i shore did sheriff radd declared
somethin wrong

  there shore as tophet is bill tolliver
broke out of jail last night

  radd didnt say anything for a moment
he had thought about that possibility for
bill tolliver was a mighty hard man to han-
dle and every time he had thought about it
he had felt that cold feeling along his spine
for neither was tolliver a man to forget or
forgive

  howd it happen radd asked

  pried a bar off a window but somebody
had to slip somethin to do the pryin with
yuh shore yore conscience didnt get to
botherin yuh

  my conscience has pestered me some all
right like i expected it would but if yuh
mean did i help bill break jail i didnt
no i reckon not catwick sighed well
anyway hes gone figgered he might have
headed out here

  his best chance looks like would be to
head over toward the big slates

  if he was aimin at a quick getaway
yeah said catwick

  what yuh mean
the meanest man	

   you know sam well as me that bill
 tolliver-whatever he done-aint one to
 forget when hes done dirt

   i just done what i had to do radd said
 stubbornly yuh said yoreself there wasnt
 but one way-the right way

   thats a fact well anyway yuh better
 keep yore eye peeled till hes safe back in
 jail

   ill do that though i reckon i can take
 care of myself

   sheriff catwick lifted his hand and rode
 away

 radd sat down on the doorstep to
 ponder this new turn of events but
 pretty soon an uneasy feeling came over him
 like maybe unfriendly eyes were watching
 him from the hemming timber he got up
 rather hastily and went inside

   he stayed in the house most of the after-
 noon his gun close at hand radd was not a
 coward but he just was not taking any
 chances with bill tolliver likely it wouldnt
 be long before tolliver was behind bars
 again

   when he went out near sundown to do up
 the chores he was jittery as a jaybird again
 he had that feeling of being watched by un-
 seen and hostile eyes once he heard a low
 sound in a nearby lodgepole thicket and
 could have sworn he saw the figure of a man
 fade back into the shadows he was glad
 when he got back to the house

    he didnt make a light but sat there in the
 darkness straining eyes and ears but he
 could hear only the wind in the pines and
 the occasional weird hunting cry of an owl
 and after a while the wolves sometimes the
 eerie howling was dim and distant sometimes
 near the cabin each night the huge pack
 goaded by their ancient heritage of hunger
 roamed the timbered ridges

   always the melancholy sound had made
 sam radd shiver with revulsion tonight
 however the chant seemed to carry an added
 savagery and menace

   the dark room suddenly filled with mov-
 ing sinister forms

   radd got up quickly struck a match and
 applied it to a lamp hurriedly he shaded the
 windows then barred front and back doof-s
 nerves he told himself jeeringly-imagina-
  tion-and yet he knew that the danger from
 bill tolliver if he had not been recaptured
 was very real

   he went back into the front room and sat
 down his gun on a table beside him the
 wolves continued to howl

   hearing a light step behind him radd

whirled hand sliding toward the gun then
he got very still

  bill toluver stood in the kitchen door-
way a cold smile on his lips and a gun in his
hand tolliver was bareheaded his clothes
dirty and torn there was a wicked merci-
less light in his dark eyes

  i figgered yuh couldnt stand the dark for
long sam he said i sneaked in the back
door before yuh lit the lamp go ahead grab
the gun if yuhd rather it might be easier
that way

  bill what yuh want here radd asked

hoarsely

  i want you didnt i say id show yuh
whod have the most regret mebbe  show
yuh whos the meanest too get on yore
feet and back against the wall

  slowly radd obeyed tolliver moved for-
ward and took the gun from the table then
he backed to a shelf at the far side of the
room and took down a bottle half-filled with
a grayish liquid radd licked dry ups his
eyes widening

  what yuh aimin to do with that bill

  cant yuh guess tolliver grinned again
maliciously get that lantern off the nail
there and light it

  again radd obeyed stark certainty gray-
ing his face

 you carry it tolhver ordered when
the lantern was burning walk out that
door-and dont forget this gunll be just
about a foot from yore striped back

  bill yuhre makin a bad mistake i
didnt-

  move blast yuh

  sam radd unlatched the front door and
went out carrying the lantern closely fol-
lowed by tolliver outside tolliver took a
coiled rope from a nail on the wall

  that way tolhver clipped along the
creek

  they walked along the creek bank some-
times in deep shadows sometimes in bright
patches of moonlight rfdds mind worked
desperately trying to find some way out of
this predicament he knew that barring mir-
acles he was doomed there was no mercy
in bill tolhver maybe sheriff catwick was
near stalking tolhver but radd knew that
whatever happened would have to happen
quickly

  he could hear tollivers solid footsteps di-
rectly behind him like radd thought de-
spairingly a stalking wolf the thought made
him strain his ears the marauders were
silent now  but they were still out there
stalking the thickets and ridges hungry sav-
age
	exciting western

   thisll do tolliver said suddenly 

  they had come to a small timber-hemmed
clearing a quarter of a mile from the ranch-
house nearby a nest of black broken walls
towered upward at an order from tolliver
sam radd placed the lantern on the ground

   put yore back to that tree tolliver said
motioning toward a pine whose bole was
thick as a mans body

   bill yuh cant do this radd said desper-
ately

  cant i the dark man spat ill show
yuh what i can do get against that tree or
ill blow yuh apart

                                           

nis face pale and set radd obeyed with
the rope tolliver lashed him securely
to the tree then tolliver took from his
pocket the bottle containing the grayish liq-
uid he uncorked the bottle and deliberate-
ly sprayed the liquid over radds clothes

  a sweetish odor that was vile and pene-
trating struck sharply at their nostrils sam
radd knew very well that the evil-smelling
stuff was a powerful wolf lure he knew that
the hunger-driven beasts would tear to
pieces anything alive even in the vicinity of
that odor with it on his clothes he was as
good as dead now

  bill he pleaded dont do this to me
them gray devilsll tear me to ribbons
thats a fact tolliver sneered and ill
be close by ill hear yuh squealin like the
pig yuh are

  then yuhll hear me till the day yuh die
yuh wont ever be able to sleep good any
more

   ill sleep all right but im givin yuh a
chance

  what kind of chance

  tolliver took the six-shooter from his
waist-band and removed from it all except
a single cartridge then he stepped forward
and placed it in radds hand

  dont try to use that bullet on me he
warned because then yuh wouldnt have
even a slim chance yuh can raise that gun-
muzzle just about to yore middle if yuhd
rather have it that way it suits me if i
hear the gun go off ill come back and in-
vestigate dont be in any hurry sam ive
got plenty of time yuhve got just yore
choice to make

  he took up the lantern turned and started
walking away and radd cursed him then in
a shrill bitter voice bill tolliver didnt
pause or look back but strode on out of the
clearing the lantern growing dimmer and
dimmer until it vanished altogether

  radds tirade stopped suddenly he stood

tense head on one side listening then he
heard the sound again-the fierce drawn-
out howl of a hunting wolf

   the sound sent wild fear leaping through
sam radd in a sudden frenzy he strained
at his bonds but he knew instantly that he
-was securely trussed without hope of escape
he grew still again sweat running over his
face

   he heard the wolfs howl again followed
closely by several others were they closer
as soon as they caught a whiff of the power-
ful lure they would come bounding like gray
demons through the timber eyes wickedly
aglare and fangs slavering the wind made
a laughing mocking sound in the pines wa-
ter in the nearby creek made a jeering
sound

  radds head jerked up there were the
wolves again and now without doubt the
sounds were closer and the cries had a dif-
ferent timbre-shorter more savage and
eager as if the gaunt beasts scented meat
without doubt radd knew the wind had
wafted to the pack the irresistible scent of
the lure

   sam radd swore again peering desperate-
ly about the last wild bitter hope for sur-
vival fading from his eyes sweat ran over
his face into his eyes and mouth the gun-
butt felt hot to the palm of his hand

  now suddenly he heard the patter of
padded feet he heard savage whining
snarls saw the fiery glow of fierce eyes in
the shadowy timber

   bill-bill radd screamed

   the gun in his hand blazed and roared

   obviously bill tolliver had been close for
 he appeared almost instantly swinging the
 lighted lantern the slavering wolves slunk
 back into the thickets snarling and whining

   tolliver held up the lantern and looked at
 radd the bound mans eyes were wide his
 face gray and tight with terror his lips
 moved soundlessly

   didnt have the nerve to put that bullet
 where it belonged huh tolliver sneered
 what do yuh want

   ill do what yuh want radd whimpered
only let me loose in a few minutes a doz-
en guns wouldnt keep them devils from tear-
in me to pieces cut these ropes

   ill cut em-after yuh do some talkin

   itd put a rope about my neck

   mebbe it would that was yore choice-
the wolves or a rope its all the same to
me only this time i wont be back

   he wheeled started walking swiftly away

   wait bill wait ill do it-if youll prom-
 ise to let me go after ive talked
tolliver stopped turned

i wont do a thing to stop yuh he
promised if yuh can make a getaway thats
yore good luck

  i-it was me that killed clay farnum and
stole the bank money radd whined while
pretendin to be off in the hills lookin for
strays i killed him because i thought he had
recognized me when i found out the bank
had down the serial numbers of the money
id taken i was afraid to try to use it so i
got the idea of framin the whole business
onto you and collectin the thousand-dollar
bounty the bank had offered

  somethin else tolliver said grimly
yuh remembered that when we went pard-
ners in the circle rt wed signed a paper
sayin that in case either of us died the whole
outfit went to the one left alive so with me
framed into a hangrope yuh stood to gain
not only a thousand dollars but my half of
the outfit as well

right radd agreed now cut me loose
true to his promise bill tolliver drew a
long-bladed knife and slashed through the
ropes that bound radd radd stepped away
from the tree flexing his muscles

  remember yuh promised to let me go
i said i wouldnt try to stop yuh tolli-
ver agreed

  but i didnt make any such promise a
bleak voice rapped and sheriff catwick
came clambering down from a niche in the
walls gun in hand mebbe i wont either
sam if yuh want to make a run for it dont
figger yuhd get moren a couple dozen jumps
with that wolf lure on yore clothes

  sam radd had whirled started to leap into
the shadowy timber but now he stopped
abruptly the pattering feet were still out
there the red-glaring eyes were inching
closer radd glared from sheriff catwick to
the grim-faced bill tolliver

  you two tricked me he snarled

  thats a plumb fact the sheriff agreed
mildly gent wouldnt be much of a sheriff
if he couldnt tell the smell of a skunk when
its up real close its bad though when he
has to furnish the crowbar for a prisoner to
break out of his own jail he chuckled
i figger we got just about time enough to
get back on that wall before them four-
footed deputies of mine and bills start snap-
pin at the seats of our pants or had yuh
rather stay down here sam

  sam radd was the first to reach the safe-
ty of the niche

what makes
writing ability grow

  for a number of years tlie newspaper institute of amer-
ica has been giving free writing aptitude testa to men and
women with literary ambitions

  sometimes ib seems half the people in america who are
fired with the desire to write have taken advantage of this
offer to measure their ability

what the tests show 

  up to date no one who could be called a born writer
has fllled out our writing aptitude test we have not yet
discovered a single individual miraculously endowed by
nature with all the qualities that go to make up a suc-
cessful author

  one aspirant has intereskig ideas-and a dull uninter-
esting style another has  veat creative imagination but is
woefully weak on struct re and technique a third has a
natural writing knack- yet lacks judgment and knowledge
of human behavior in each case success can come only
after the missing links have been forged in

  here then is the principal reason why so many promis-
ing writers fail to go ahead their talent is one-sided-
incomplete it needs rounding out

learn to write by writing

xtewsraper institute training is based on journalism-contlnu-
ous writing-the sort of training that turns out more successful
writers than any other experience many of the authors of todays
best sellers are newspaper-trained men and women

  one advantage of our new tork copy desk method  that it starts
you writing and keeps you writing in your own home on your own
time week by week you receive actual assignments lust as if you
were right at work on a great metropolitan dally

   all yuur writing is individually corrected and criticized by veteran
 writers with years of experience breaking in new authors they
 will point out those faults of style struc-
 ture or viewpoint that keep you from pro-
 gressing at the same time they will give
 you constructive suggestions for building up
 and developing your natural aptitudes

in fact so stimulating is this associa-
tion that stuaent-membcra often begin to
sell their work before they finish the course

we do not mean to insinuate that they sky-
rocket into the big money or become
prominent overnight most beginnings are
made with earnings of  j ju or
more for material that takes little time to
write - stories articles on business hob-
bles sports travels local and club activi-
ties etc-things that can easily be turnotl
out in leisure hours and often on tha
impulse of the moment

manhunters aint human

by sam brant

    hot anger over a killing thaws sheriff leachs cold heart
    but nothing can alter the deadly wisdom of his icy stare

a tall lean man with frozen gray
features and heatless dark eyes
sheriff mike leach sat in his office
in apache wells and watched the rider who
was coming along the street he knew the
rider-stocky tow-headed sam brett who
owned a little cow outfit over on blackfoot
creek

  brett the sheriff saw seemed in a hurry
his roan was sweat-covered and he was
angling toward the hitchrack before the
sheriffs office

 mike leach grimaced when a man had

busirifess with him it usually meant trouble
else they kept their distance

  men the cold-eyed lawman thought sar-
donically are like wolves only worse
wolves kill only when they are hungry
after tying his horse brett came quickly
into the office excitement was in his pale
eyes

  sheriff he said abruptly without greet-
ing i reckon yuh better get out to lige
taggerts place

  why should i the sheriff asked whats
wrong	i
  old lige has been killed

  mike leachs eyes narrowed but his still
face showed no excitement at all

  who killed him and why he asked

  i dont know all i know is hes dead i
stopped by his place a little while ago-aimed
to buy some hay from him when i couldnt
rouse him i opened the door and looked in-
side there lige was on the cabin floor
stone dead

  mebbe it was an accident

  mebbe-i dont know brett drew a
shaky breath i didnt examine him close
didnt look like any accident to me though
he was layin on his face and looked like
hed been shot in the back he was all messy
i-well blood always makes me kind of weak
to the stomach so i got out of there quick
and headed for town to tell you who yuh
reckon could have done it

  the sheriff got slowly to his feet no emo-
tion at all showed in his eyes men said that
mike leach had a block of ice for a heart
they said he killed for the brutal pleasure of
inflicting pain on others they said his bitter
implacable hatred for all outlaws was only
an excuse for those killings a mask to hide
his own wolfish nature

   dont know sheriff leach said curtly
in answer to bretts question but if lige
taggert was murdered ill find out who done
itiand kill him-or see that he hangs
mind if i ride back with yuh brett
asked lige was a crusty unsociable old
coot but i kind of cottoned to him he
pulled me out of a bad tight once with a
loan

  suit yoreself the sherf said laconical-
ly ill ride in ten minutes

exactly ten minutes later sheriff
leach and sam brett rode out of
apache wells headed north toward old lige
taggerts little outfit at the head of turkey
canyon brett had spread the news of tag-
gerts death and the citizens of apache wells
watched the sheriffs departure with eyes
that were cynical yet held a grudging respect

  while mike leach was not a man who in-
vited friendship no one denied that he had
brought law and order to the county his
reputation had spread and as a rule crim-
inals steered clear of apache wells

  he was known as the sheriff who would
rather kill an outlaw than capture him
cold taciturn he had no close friends and
if he wanted any nobody knew it on the

trail of a killer he was tireless relentless
without mercy

  without human feeling or kindness
smugly said those who had elected him sheriff
-and felt glad and safe for the protection
he afforded them a manhunter a killer
a human bloodhound they declared and
didnt linger longer than was necessary in
his presence   

  it was shortly after noon when sheriff
leach and brett reached lige taggerts run-
down ranchhouse taggert had lived here
alone in his unclean log cabin a miserly sur-
ly oldster who did not welcome visitors un-
less they brought him profit in some form he
raised few cattle but rather had of late years
planted most of his acreage in stock feed
which he stored until winter and sold for
outrageous prices to his less far-sighted
neighbors

 lige taggert had made money and it
was an ill-kept secret over the range that he
distrusted banks the few who had been
admitted to his cabin hadnt missed seeing
the old iron safe in a corner of his room
sheriff leach found things at taggerts
cabin much as sam brett had said taggert
was dead even more unlovely in death than
he had been in life he lay sprawled on his
face on the floor before the old iron safe
he had been shot in the back

  the safe door stood open papers were
scattered about except for a few pennies
there was no money in the safe

  dont touch anything leach told sam
brett curtly stay back out of the way till
i have a look-see

  i didnt touch a thing when i was here
before brett protested i was plain scared
i reckon first gent i ever seen whod died
by vilence

  the fat bearded oldster leach judged
had been dead since some time the night
before he looked carefully over the room
there was no sign of a struggle

 whoever done it must have got lige
cold leach said as if talking to himself
he held a gun on lige and made him open
the safe then the skunk shot lige in the
back took what money there was and left
way i see it brett agreed yuh reckon
he left a trail of some kind

  the sheriff didnt answer he stooped sud-
denly and took something from the floor
almost under taggerts body he glanced at
the small shiny object then thrust it into
his pocket

i
  find something brett asked curiously
empty six-shooter shell leach grunted
figger it come from the killers gun
stands to reason dont it after shootin
lige the killer must have punched out the
empty and reloaded without thinkin what
he was doin its mistakes like that that
prove all killers are dumb well i reckon
theres nothin else to be found here ill
have a look outside

  they went outside and the sheriff started
nosing about like an old hound dog it took
him less than five minutes to find the spot
in a cedar thicket a hundred yards behind
the cabin where the killer had left his horse
to sneak up to taggerts cabin afoot to
leachs experienced eyes the story was plain

  now we got somethin to go on brett
declared excitedly all weve got to do is
foller them tracks and weve got the killer
looks like mike leachs eyes were as
harj as agates and glowed with an inner
fire that was wickedly eaer ill get the
snake that done it if i have to foller him
to perdition

  they got their horses and took up the
trail it led almost due west obviously the
killer despite the fact that it was dark had
ridden fast after leaving taggerts cabin
at first he had made no effort to conceal his
trail after a couple of miles however
probably after the killer had recovered from
his first panic the tracks became harder to
follow

but leach was an expert tracker he
clung grimly to the trail followed by
sam brett and after a five-mile ride they
paused atop a ridge and sat looking down
into a miniature valley between two tim-
bered slopes

  down there was a log cabin ranchhouse
well-kept and relatively new sheds and a
corral that held several cows smoke was
curling from the cabin chimney a creek
wound along the floor of the swale between
the ridges in a second corral was a rangy
sorrel horse

  the slight figure of a boy was in front
of the cabin evidently about eleven or
twelve years old he was dressed in faded
denims and a checked shirt he was swing-
ing a lariat trying to lasso a post

  the trail the sheriff and brett had been
following led down off the ridge straight
toward the ranch buildings

  matt taos brett breathed glancing ob-

 liquely at the tall sheriff i    by gosh this
 is goin to be hard to swallow

  leach said nothing for a moment his face
might have been carved from stone the little
cow outfit down there he knew belonged
to matt taos matt lived there with his son
nick the boys mother having died two or
three years before taos had served a prison
sentence for cattle stealing but most folks
in the county believed he was innocent of
the crime

  somethin elsell make it look bad for
matt too brett went on shaking his head
there was that run-in matt had with lige
in town a couple days ago the whole town
heard it over some money matt owed lige
wasnt it

  you ought to know grunted the sheriff
yuh stood not ten feet away and took it
all in

  so did a dozen others includin you
brett protested thats what might make
it go hard with matt-the threats he made
sheriff i wish i hadnt come with you id
be willin to turn and ride away and just
forget about what ive seen if itd help any
matt taos is my neighbor

  it wouldnt help any leach said coldly
a killers a killer and theyre a buzzardly
breed id like to stand by and see em
all bum in purgatory

  brett looked at the sheriff and shivered
seeing the wholly savage and merciless light
in the lawmans eyes

  if thats the way yuh want it brett mut-
tered me i aint all stone and ice like you

i	got a heart itll go kind of hard with that
button down there though what about
him

  well what about him

  could yuh sleep good at night knowin
yuhd took a boys daddy away from him
brett yuhre meddlin in somethin that
aint yore business leach said furiously
he controlled himself with an effort but the
dark bitterness remained in his eyes if itll
help yuh any to know i once had a boy
that was years ago up in montana he was
just about the same age as matt taos kid
down there his mother was dead too and
he liked to ride and rope and swim just like

i	reckon that button does

  one day he rode into town with me in
the buckboard we wus ridin along the
street when these four masked hombres
come from the bank they jumped onto their
hosses and started along the street toward


us firin their guns in all directions i pulled
over to the side to let em pass i didnt
try to stop em didnt even have a gun but
that didnt make any difference-they cut
down on us i heard the boy kind of sigh
and then he fell over against me he was
dead

  a month later i pinned on a badge swear-
in that id fight outlaws and killers until i
died and that id never let one live if i
could kill him thats what ive done

  i-im plumb sorry sheriff sam brett
said huskily i reckon i didnt savvy

  but mike leach had already nudged his
buckskin down the slope toward the ranch
buildings brett followed a moment later
they pulled up before the log ranchhouse
the freckled tow-headed youngster had
stopped his practise with the rope and re-
garded them with wide wary eyes

  yore paw at home sonny the sheriff
asked

  the boy nodded somebody to see yuh
pap he called

  a big blond man with broad tanned fea-
tures came from the cabin he looked un-
smilingly at the two nodded curtly he
wore faded levis and a gray shirt and a
bone-handled  six-shooter was strapped
about his waist in a land of s the sheriff
could remember few men who owned 
guns

  light down gents taos said cordially

mike leach swung to the ground
followed after a moments hesitation
by brett there was a certain wariness about
the young rancher taos he knew this was
not a friendly visit the boy was watching
wide-eyed

  i reckon ill have to arrest yuh taos
leach said bluntly

  taos showed no surprise only a slight
stiffening of his body

 why

  for killin lige taggert

  if taggerts dead i didnt kill him
thatll be for a jury to decide ill take
yore gun

  you let my pap alone nick taos cried
shrilly he never killed anybody some-
bodys always devilin him

  the boy took a step forward the rope
drawn back threateningly his eyes blazing

  its all right nick matt taos said gently
everythings goin to be fine

  he offered no resistance as the sheriff

stepped forward and lifted the  from ts

holster

  now mebbe yuh tell me what this is all
about he said stiffly

 got a bad memory leach asked sar-
donically all right some time last night
lige taggert was killed and his safe robbed
brett here rode by there this mornin and
found him we rode out picked up the kill-
ers trail in a cedar thicket and follered it
straight to here that help any

  it proves somebodys plumb loco i went
to bed early last night and didnt wake up
till daylight

  yuh got proof of that

 why-why nobody except the button
here and i reckon he was asleep too see
here sheriff-just because i done time in
the pen yuh cant-

  thats got nothin to do with it lets
have a look at the sorrel over there

  they walked over to the corral a brief
examination showed dried sweat on the sor-
rels back and sides proof that the animal
had been ridden hard not recently but sev-
eral hours before one flank had been slashed
cruelly with a spur

 sam brett spoke been several hours
since that bronc was rode sheriff

  thats just it mike leach said grimly
some time last night id say how about
that taos

  the ranchers eyes held bitter desperation
i dont know i saw when i watered
and fed the sorrel this mornin that hed been
rode but it wasnt me that rode him i dont
know who did you two figger it out yuhre
so cussed certain it was me killed lige
i had nothin to do with this matt brett
denied quickly when i come along i had
no idea how itd turn out i got to admit it
looks bad follerin a trail here and findin
yore sorrel like this that and the quarrel
yuh had with lige in town two days ago
but i still aint sayin yuh done it

  shore i quarreled with taggert matt
taos said quietly when i borrered that
five hundred dollars from him last year i
didnt know what a doublecrossin skunk
he was two weeks ago i went to him told
him i didnt have the money to pay and
asked for an extension he said it was all
right said he was busy then but to come
back today-thats when the note falls due-
and we d fix up the papers

well i began to smell a rat and men-
tioned it to him two days ago he denied
 tellin me i could have an extension said
 that if i didnt pay every penny when the
 note was due hed take my outfit i kind of
 went off half-cocked i reckon and said some
 things but it wasnt a killin matter

  not unless yuh needed that money in
 taggerts safe

   my pap didnt kill anybody the freckled
 boy shrilled again angrily jast because
 yuhre a sheriff yuh got no right to come
 here pesterin us ive heard about you
 yuh aint human-yuh shoot men down just
 because yuh like to kill yuh beast

   nick matt taos said sharply be quiet
  that all the evidence yuhve got sheriff
 i reckon so but its enough

   how about that empty forty-four shell
 yuh found on taggerts floor brett inter-
 rupted not many men pack a forty-four
 sam brett suddenly clamped his lips to-
 gether mike leach had turned slowly was
 staring at him with implacable eyes

   brett he said flatly yuhre a filthy
 low-down killer go for yore gun

   sam bretts face had gone chalky
 w-what yuh mean sheriff he stam-
 mered

   what i said you killed lige taggert
 looted his safe and tried to frame it onto
 matt taos ive got less use for a back-
 shootin killer than for a snake draw

   no-wait brett cried desperately i
    yuh must be loco yuh got no proof
 i done that

   all the proof i need yuh come here while
 matt taos and the boy was asleep last night
 stole the sorrel from the corral rode it to
 taggerts place yuh murdered taggert
 robbed his safe then yuh rode the sorrel
 back here in a hurry pretendin to try to
 hide yore trail but really makin shore it
 could be follered yuh figgered that along
 with the quarrel matt had had with taggert
 would hang him

  yuhre crazy why would i do that
 because yuhre a crooked murderin
 snake and its not exactly a guess when
 matt wears a spur he wears it on the right
 side on this whole range brett i know
 only one man who wears a spur on his left
 heel that man is you and the sorrel there
 brett is marked on the left side

 thats no proof yuh cant arrest me
 in my own mind i know yuhre guilty
 and thats enough yuh seem to like killer
 law and thats the kind im givin yuh im
 givin yuh an even break draw cuss yuh

   mike leach had crouched lower now his
 relentless eyes were as bleak as glacier ice

   sweat was running over bretts face his
 eyes were wide and bitter

   for the last time brett draw

  all the courage seemed suddenly to go
 out of brett leaving him limp and trembling

  no-no i wont do it he whimpered
 yuh want to kill me yuh want to see me
 there on the ground kickin and dyin if
 yuh shoot me itll be murder i-i killed
 taggert-im willin to stand trial for it
 only dont shoot me

   contempt in his eyes leach stepped for-
 ward and took bretts gun too yeller to
 live-or die-by yore own law he sneered

   by gosh sheriff matt taos said mo-
 ments later yuh nearly had me convinced
 i had killed lige taggert howd yuh figger
 it was brett thatd done it

   why brett convicted hisself the sheriff
 said slowly there was them spur marks
 on the left side of yore sorrel and another
 thing-brett aimed to make folks think youd
 killed and robbed taggert to get the money
 to pay off the mortgage against yore outfit
 he didnt know id loaned yuh the five hun-
 dred right after that spat yuh had with
 taggert to pay off that note

   i thought about that taos admitted i
 hadnt mentioned it because yuh asked me
 not to but that was pretty slim evidence-
 that and the spur marks-to accuse a man
 of murder on was that all

   not quite the tall sheriff looked with
 grim humor at the crest-fallen killer brett
 tipped his hand when he said how about
 that forty-four shell yuh found on taggerts
 floor happened id put that shell in my
 pocket right quick without givin brett time
 to see it and i hadnt said anything about
 it bein a forty-four if he hadnt left that
 shell there a-purpose after killin taggert
 with a forty-four how would he have known
 what caliber it was

   by gosh sheriff yuhre plumb smart
 young nick taos declared admiringly i
 reckon ill be a lawman like you when i
 grow up he looked embarrassed wriggling
 his bare toes in the dust i-im sorry i
 said them things about yuh i take em back
 yuh reckon yuh could come out and visit
 pap and me sometime

   why i reckon i could mike leach said
 softly his eyes were clear and without
 bitterness mebbe right often how about

 locally favorable cash crops such as beans
 potatoes or sometimes sugar beets there
 should be enough dairy cows or other liva-
 stock maintained to utilize the feed produced

   thats merely a generalization there is
 no cut and dried rule to follow in irrigation
 farming in some sections or in some cases
 where the best crop production bet is hay
 and pasture the entire farm may be devoted
 principally to livestock dairy cattle beef
 cattle or even sheep in other cases fruit
 and vegetable raising poultry or turkey
 raisng may be the main enterprise

    he choice is wide and the possible com-
 bi ations numerous but the settler must
 make his own decisions using his special
 talents and experience to help him plot out
 the most likely direction in which his in-
 dividual farm success will lie

   whatever the ultimate choice some type of
 intensive farming is virtually a prerequisite
 to successful irrigation farming inasmuch as
 the water used must be paid for high crop

returns or high value crops are needed to
make the land pay off on the other hand
the very fact that high value crops can be
produced on- irrigated land results in smaller
farms that is smaller acreages being neces-
sary

  most general purpose irrigated farms are
less than  acres in size popular sub-divi-
sions are  acre farms or  acre farms

  how and when irrigation water is used are
other factors important to the success of ir-
rigated farming most crops must be irri-
gated several times during the growing sea-
son when they need water the correct
amount should be distributed evenly over
the crop area

  too much water can cause important plant
foods to leach out r the soil too little will
cut down the crop - ield as will water applied
at the wrong timr

  all this wont make you an experienced
irrigation farmer in a few minutes reading
time its not intended to the idea is simply
to give a few pointers sufficient to demon-
strate that there are wrinkles to successful
irrigation farming that require special skills
knowledge and experience

  for that matter putting new land into
fruitful production has always been a job
that takes a bit of doing but its been done
before and its being done today the mod-
ern settlers around prosser are tackling it
with the spirit and courage that led an earlier
generation of homeseekers to the first found-
ing of a new empire at the end of the oregon
trail

  you too can tackle it the same way

  thats all for now yuh western-minded
guys and gals therell be more next issue

-captain ranger



in our next issue

a wild woolly and whacky new adven-
ture of the wests funniest favorites
-tombstone and speedy-tops the list in
the next issue of exciting western its
called the law of averages and is
written of course by that master spinner of
yarns that tickle your funnybone w c
tuttle

  it all began when tombstone jones and
speedy smith climbed off the caboose of a
long cattle train and came down to the de-
pot limping a little in their high-heel boots
and carrying their war-bags they were
back to the headquarters of the cattlemens
association and none too happy about it

  as they limped up to the depot they were
handed a telegram from their boss jim
keaton

  no report from you on last two cases
the wire read you are impossible come
 in at once i need men i can depend on
 good grunted tombstone im glad he
 appreciates us

   appreciates us gasped speedy

   shore he says for us to come in at once
 cause he needs men he can depend on

   i hope yuhre right sighed speedy but
 it dont read like that to me

   thats the worst of bein able to read
 speedy-yuh get things all wrong

   they limped down to the cattlemens as-
 sociation office

   jim keaton was more than a little peeved
 that he had not heard from his two men
 in weeks

   we cleaned up both cases you had us on
 jim said speedy

   i know you did keaton snapped back i
 managed to get reports from two sheriffs-
 but none from you two where is the six
 thousand dollars you two got on that deal in
 apache butte

   jim replied tombstone soberly any-
 body will tell yuh that if yuh keep puttin
 yore money on the double o the law of
 averages will make yuh e-ventually win
 some day said keaton soberly when
 youre both old-youll look back and wish
 you had saved your money

   id like to ask yuh a honest question jim
 said tombstone did yuh ever see a old
 range detective

   well i suppose there is i dont know of
 one off-hand tombstone

   they dont last declared tombstone
 the law of averages works on em said
 speedy

   i wouldnt worry too much about detec-
 tives said keaton from now on your life
 expectancy may increase in other words
 ive got to replace you two im sorry but
 you two are unreliable

   yuh mean were fired asked speedy
 yes im afraid that is what i mean
 speedy

   at that moment a man came in and handed
 jim keaton several telegrams jim keaton
 stared at one of them as he read it his face
 just a bit white under his natural tan the
 message told of the shooting of jim haley
 the new man keaton had hired to take the
 place of tombstone and speedy

   well said tombstone i reckon the law
 of averages caught up with him

  wait a minute snapped keaton you
 two head out there for west fork right away
 i want the man who killed haley theres

right from the start when clint gregg young
printer on a cowtown newspaper goes down
into the millrace to chop free a snag that has
fouled the waterwheel supplying the motive
power for his newspaper press

  the night was black but gregg could see
a man poling a raft on the river and appar-
ently trying to make a landing on the sand-
bar which the tailrace had thrust out into
the river the man seemed to be in trouble

  keep polin amigo gregg shouted to
him waving his lantern ill wade out an
lend you a hand

  a guttural oath was greggs answer then
a six-gun spat flame from the blackness and
a bullet snuffed out greggs lantern

  a second bullet ricocheted off the water
alongside greggs boots a moment later
gregg saw the gunman scramble up on the
mudbank and disappear into the night

  gregg didnt get the significance of the in-
cident until he climbed the stairs back up to
the newspaper office and met his boss old
pop dorrigan

  the devils broke loose up in the copper-
lodes tonight clint the old man yelled
somebody dynamited the railway trestle up
the river and wrecked a train load of lumber
the fireman talked before he died he said
the man who touched off the dynamite made
his getaway-on a raft down the river

 look forward to showdown rides
the river by walker a tompkins for
gunsmoke thrills and action

  a new navajo raine novelet by jackson
cole is also in the next great all-star issue
it is called rangers ride alone and
is sure to please all you navajo raine fans

  in addition well have another trail
blazers chat and many other crack
western yams of the kind that have made
exciting western a consistent winner




 theres excitement in every page from cover
 to cover in the next issue

letters to the editor

 we have received interesting letters
 this time and we only hope that you
 readers keep on writing as faithfully as you
 have in the past its through your letters
 that we get to know what you like and dont
 like so dont be bashful let us hear what
 you have to say-be it praise or blame

   i read an article in a recent issue of exciting
 western in which it was stated that gold min-
 ing in arizona was out i know better i came to
 arizona twelve years ago from michigan we
 have an open pit gold mine which contains a lot
 of ore but the country is so rugged its hard to
 get at we have never worked the mine our-
 selves but we have been told by those who know
 that good gold was taken out and samples taken
 from all around show gold there is also placer
 gold in the washes-pearl rose bumble bee
 arizona

   of all the western magazines that i have read
 i think exciting western is tops in reading
 entertainment i cant find a story in each issue
 that is not chock full of laughs and thrills keep
 up the good work-charles beal broken bow
 nebraska

   i read exciting western every month and
 the stories are always very exciting tombstone
 and speedy are my favorites and then comes
 navajo raine but why do you miss having a
 navajo raine story in som issues-a n horne
 shoreham vermont

  i like exciting western very much
 though some of your stories arent so good my
 rating of the stories is-first w c tuttles
 tombstone and speedy yarns second alamo
 paige and third navajo raine the tombstone
 and speedy stories are super-walter paulsen
 chinook montana

   your tombstone and speedy novelets are the
 best of the lot and so is alamo paige your
 yarns would be more popular if you keep them
 complete down here we all clamor for excit-
 ing western and it would be a pity if it ran
 serials and we missed an installment-kenneth
 newman cape town south africa

   thats all we can quote from our mail bag
 this time but the above are typical of hun-
 dreds of communications received-for which
 we thank all of you well be back next issue
 with plenty more letters and postcards and
 well be looking for one from-you so
 sit down pronto and drop us a line about
 what you like in exciting western and
 what you dont like please address your mail
 to the editor exciting western
