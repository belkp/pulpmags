   out of a deep sleep he woke her she
thought she knew him so well  et now
at two in the morning he burst on her
with this terror-this mystery-this what
   its the beginning of one of the best
mysteries ever solved by the great detective
craig kennedy
                                                                      he is the detective genius of
 our age he has taken science -

 america has been watching craig kennedy-marvelling at the strange new startling things that
 deiectivc hero would unfold such plots-such suspense-with real vivid people moving through
 the maelstrom of life frenchmen have mastered the art of terror stories english writers have
 thrilled whole nations by their artful heroes russian ingenuity has fashioned wild tales of
 mystery but all of these seem old-fashioned-out-of-date-beside the infinite variety-the
 weird excitement of arthur b reeves tales

    when the police of new york failed to solve one of the most fearful murder mysteries of the time edgar
 allan poe-far off there in paris-found the solution the story is in these volumes
    he was a detective by instinct-he was a story-teller by divine inspiration before or since-no one has ever
 had his power to make your hair stand on end-to send chills up your back-to hold you in terror-horror to
 read breathlessly-to try to guess the ending-to enjoy the perfect flawless style-to feel the power of the
 master-that is what you can do in earh and all of poes undying stories

what would
you do
suppose you told a good
friend of your success and
your good friend said i
dont believe it what
would you say 
suppose you had hundreds
of good-paying permanent
positions to offer men who
had a little spare time and
who could use 
  a month
extra and i said it isnt
so what would you do
about it
that is my case exactly
what ive said about our subscription
work i true it offers you an opportunity
to make  to  a month it
may take all your time or only a few
minutes a day-you work when you please
and where you please and yet you say
it isnt so
what should i do about it 
there you go week after week scratching
to make ends meet  you would sell
ur only t wenty or thirty minutes a day you
couu ha-ve all the extra mousy you reed
but you wont believe me
you could kft a complete outfit and
prove what f say by simply writing me
but you wont do it what more can i
say to you
a tw-o-ccnt stamp invested in writing
me will put juki into vour pocket almost
before you know it every man and
every woman you know reads magazines
they will read adventvre the ie-
ijni-ator and everybodys magazine
  harrison e jii-er of ohio
and theyll be only too glad to give their
subscriptions to you why subscriptions
by the thousands are coming in to us
direct because we do not have enough
representatives to look after all the busi-
ness why dont you frj it out
instead of saying oh i cant do it-
be independent and drop me a line today
and settle the argument for yourself
mr biller whose picture is above and
hundreds of other men know what it
means to receive a salary check every
month they know that what i say about
subscription work is true
this is what mr biller says
  geuine business for the delineator
  and everybodys magazine during
  the past twelve years has been boil
  pleasant and very profitable for me
and this is onlv one of hundreds of such
letters i have before me why i could
ill this magazine with letter- from men
who have written in praise of our work
ami what it has meant to them
but dont ttke their word for it try
ii oh t you r seli  wc need

like a cyclone jingling spurs and

at his hips he stopped and
glowered about seeking enemies finding

wow
  big dan dolan wearily uncurled his
vast bulk from a chair in the rear of the
place ambled over to the warrior knocked
him downpicked him up kicked him into
the roadway and then returned to his chair
and table
  thats the third this month he ex-
plained to his younger companion seated
opposite every time some four-flusher
gits full of licker he thinks hes an army
like that feller seems like ive seen him
before but i cant quite place him and
dolans broad face wrinkled
  the eyes of the quiet slim young man
were still bulging dolans mighty fist
copyright  ly the ridgtvay company in the i
i highly civilized etc
had sounded like a hammer hitting a
board and yet the other man had been
armed
  nothin to be skeered about demurred
dolan the real bad-man has his mouth
shut and his eyes open this fool had his
mouth open nothin to it what was
you sayin about your ranch
  the younger man began to aline in his
mind the story which was being shrewdly
wormed from him he had not come here
for sympathy but he found himself granted
it anyhow so he decided to give dolan his
confidence because the big owner of the
gem saloon and general merchandise
store seemed to ask it
  carlton was comparatively a newcomer
the heavy-browed giant with just a tinge
of gray in his black hair was the boss of die
settlement and apparently the hardest
character in the district by reputation
the world to him held two classes of people
friends and enemies the former could
have anything and the latter nothing not
even decent tombstones if he thought a
man should be eliminated he would see him
killed without compunction and yet harry
carlton found him friendly sociable and
likeable

adventure
over quizzically carkon let his absent gaze
go through a side window to where thirty
miles to the south a copper-colored moun-
tain stood out from a gaunt and treeless
range of hills and glistened in the sunlight
as if it held the treasures of the iucas
  it-it sounds like a nightmare he be-
gan cautiously you see  m a civil
engineer six years ago i tame through
this country on a railroad survey one day
while hunting in the hills i came into a little
valley that made my mouth water there
was a bare copper mountain standing over
a timbered slope leading to a lillle stream
and that led to a big meadow and lost
itself in a little green marsh willows by
the marsh and oaks in the meadows and
pines up the slope it was a lost valley-
only one way in you pass a lot of loose-
dirt scenery till you turn around a bare
granite knoll and look into-paradise
  thats lost deer valley all right
nodded dolan its a fine place
  the big man smiled a bit at the rhapsody
carltons regular-featured fine-drawn face
was alight if it were not for his square
jaw and level eyes dolan might have ap-
praised liim differently but though carl-
ton was a city man he was not a tender-
foot he was an engineer who had sur-
veyed part of the desert
  after i went away i got office work
continued carlton it lasted five years
and then i got-sick meantime id been
dreaming about that valley so before
the sickness pulled me down for keeps i
decided to come out here with my wife and
settle down on the place i had enough
money tp buy about one-third of the valley
so i bought it the fellow who owned
the place was ebenezer finch a fine
wholesouled noble character a regular
prince
  dolan grinned the bitter words seemed
to caricature the miser of lost deer valley
-the stoop-shouldered sharp-faced red-
haired slouch whose cheating and sancti-
mony were known through the county
  he only asked a reasonable price for
the two hundred acres continued the
engineer its right at the lower end of
the valley straddling the creek and strad-
dling the road that runs out i made a
topographic survey and planned an irriga-
tion system the ground makes an easy
slope toward the lower end of the valley so
by diverting the stream where it enters my
projertv on the higher ground i could run
a ditch along the inner rim of the hills and
shoot the water down to any place i liked
the stream runs all year from lost deer
spring so i figured id have water enough
to raise anything my water-right s were
perfect everything was line as silk
and then the stream quh business
  i knew it grunted dolan hosses
it was the horses nodded carlton
ebenezer finch suddenly brought three
hundred head of stock over from his esca-
lante ranch and they drank the water at the
source
  did you speak to him aboul it
sjjeak  spoke argued raved prayed
and swore he just stood there and
sniveled his regrets carlton s bitter voice
took a high-pitched mournful intonation
that mimicked finchs whine exactly
im right sorry abaout it he mocked
but i dont sees haow i kin change
things o course you got your rights to
the lower stream  dont deny no man his
rights live an let live-thats my mot-
tow the law sez the man on the upper
stream kin only hold water fer domestic an
stock purposes so im right glad to let
ye hev what i kin let through carlton
took his own voice - him hes en-
titled to the upper stream for stock
purposes only so he brought in the
stock
   um how did the talk wind up
grunted dolan
  why-he almost cried said i mustnt
judge him wrongly told me how good a
friend he was described every neighborly
act hed done i didnt know whether to
apologize or knock him down finally he
shook hands and left me standing there
wondering that was two months ago
after that hed drop over and give me help-
ful hints on how to run my ranch mean-
time not a drop from lost deer creek
i	couldnt decide whether i was being
helped or victimized till finally i stumbled
on to his full history
  dan dolan chuckled
  what happened next
  well- cant afford to nurse a dry
ranch so i put it up to him straight first
he said harsh words butter no parsnips
then he just yelled im not very strong
so i used a fence-rail then when
my temper went down i regretted
things
the boss
i made threats i said id get
that water if i had to clean out his
stock and him into the bargain
that was a month ago since then the
valley hasnt been healthy for any one
some ones been poisoning his horses and
somebody tried to burn my house i sleep
now with a shotgun alongside my bed and
the wifes close to hysterics
  where did you learn about finch
asked dolan suddenly
  the old government land-agent he
knows the whole county carlton tolled
off victims on his fingers a man named
brady had the ranch before me he died
two years ago after selling the land back to
finch cheaply the man before that was
dingle or dingwall the man before that
was one tom fulton
  tom fulton interrupted dolan ful-
ton yeh youre right it was tom fulton
go on
  the man before that was named mor-
ris and i forget the rest every one of
them lacked water couldnt irrigate and
had to sell the ranch back to finch-very
cheap two of them had lawsuits but
couldnt prove anything in other words
ebenezer finch uses the prettiest little
valley in the county as bait for a legal
logical skin-game he sells the ranch
parches the land terrorizes the victims in
one way or another and then gets the
ranch back through a friendly deal
dolans stubby fingers drummed on the
table and he stared at carlton as if to make
sure of his estimate of the man he saw a
decent clean young american neither
blond nor dark neither brilliant nor wit-
less but just an ordinary well-educated
young fellow who looked as if he might
be worth helping
  thats right he nodded its a
swindle youre stung might as well
pack up your duds and mosey along
only-i wouldnt
  you mean-fight it out asked carlton
stick grunted the big saloon-keeper
then suddenly he became halting and
diffident as if trying to pick the words to
outline his attitude im sort of neutral
he explained im jest watchin on the
side-lines mebbe im playin my own
game at that well see i got no special
interest in you im only a booster for the
county what we need is decent people
ou and your wife seem like what we want
of mirage	
if your sort always gits froze out theres
nothin for this county but booze and
roughs forever savvy
  carlton had hoped for understanding
from this burly rough-handed saloon-
keeper in shirt-sleeves but such idealism
from the owner of the worst sin palace
in the county was unexpected the big
boss caught his look and frowned
  yeh i know what youre thinkin
boomed dolans heavy voice in its choppy
manner dolan keeps a dance-hau
booze women dolan the merchant may
be different hes gittin a little old
beginnin to look ahead like a merchant
should this countrys got to have decent
people shes goin to git em
  carlton was beginning to gage this new
friend the big heavy-browed fighter
stood alone in this community and a little
chastened by the years without wife
family or close pals he was starting to feel
his loneliness his talk was not reform
it was friendship the engineer knew he
had come to the right place
  i wont take up your fight but youre
goin to git a square deal continued dolan
mebbe ill have a scheme for you pretty
soon mebbe not anyhow go back and
fight it out
  i will said the engineer arising and
gripping the others big hand for just a
moment and then letting it go
  effusiveness would have spoiled things
and he knew it then with a nod he
walked to the door and mounted his bay
horse and started for home heartened by
the knowledge that the toughest shrewdest
old ruffian in the district was a friend and
possibly an ally he was ignorant of the
political and social conditions within this
tumultuous county ignorant of the sub-
conscious motives of dolan and totally
ignorant of the size of the battle he had
entered into he only knew that he had
gained a friend whose advice and backing
might be well worth while and thus satis-
fied he started on the long trail toward the
green valley under the copper mountain
ii
two hours later carlton was riding
along a winding road on die side of
a barren rocky mountain range
sometimes when the dust settled or side-
hills failed to obstruct his view he could see

adventure
the great hazy country spread itelow him to
the westward shimmering yellow and
brown in the heat-wave far to the north-
ward lay dolans settlement its buildings
hidden by the mist of the distance far to
the south the gray heat-wave blurred the
miles that led to the county-seat
  eastward to the left the rocks on the
steep mountain range above the rider re-
flected baleful glares from the late afternoon
sunlight and above those rocks he could
see the tip of the big copper dome that stood
over his home one mile more and he
would be in the valley the rider managed
to urge his sweaty horse into a gallop just as
something stinging and vicious whined
through the air behind him
  carlton jumped he jerked back on the
reins the horse stood on its hind legs
a muffled report came from somewhere
among the boulders above carltons eyes
squinted toward a mass of gray rocks under
the shoulder of the copper mountain
  the devil muttered the engineer un-
decided while the horse pranced
  another bullet zipped past the animals
nose and spattered into a red rock below
carlton made up his mind instantly he
jabbed spurs into the bay so savagely that
it laid back its ears and flew
  over shale rock over hard ledges over
sandy washes the panting bay sped toward
the gateway of gray-green boulders that
marked the entrance to the valley the
bullets ceased coming the marksmans
vantage-point was out of range hidden by
cliffs and side-hills the engineers mind
was working fast the man who fired at him
had a rifle carlton only had a pistol in a
holster under his light khaki jacket if he
could get to close quarters he might inves-
tigate things that was his plan
  the horse reached the comer of lost deer
gap and started to turn in carlton halted
him dismounted slapped the animal on the
flank and walked deliberately along the
outer rim of the granile gates of lost deer
valley the horse started for home carl-
ton started to climb
  warily carefully trying to give no hint
of his coming the engineer scrambled up-
ward over hot ledges of gray stone or little
wastes of yellow sand once the ugly flat
head of a diamond-back rattler disputed
him from the top of a bluish rock but he
gave it the right of way higher up a
pungent smell told him he was coming into
a nest of them so he detoured still higher
he came upon the trail of a bobcat in a patch
of streak- brown dirt but he noticed it only
subconsciously he was on the spine of the
ridge now and ahead was the giant pile of
gray rocks where his enemy had lurked
carlton surmised who it was but he was
not quite sure ebenezer finch seemed too
sanctimonious for this sort of business
  the engineer began to crjwl hot rocks
blistered his hands and the sun heated the
metal on his blue pistol-barrel but he wiped
the sweat from ills brow and kept going
ahead he made for the western edge in
order to keep off the sky-line his fooi
slipped on a rock which hit another which
struck another until a little avalanche of
rock and dirt thundered down the hill and
gathered momentum
  a bullet whistled past carlton a rifle
roared almost in front of him and a wisp of
smoke blew around the corner of a big
rock carlton started dodging forward in
zigzag leaps the rifle cracked again but
he reached the rock the smoke liad just
come from its east side so he ran around the
west side just as he heard the lever of the
rifle throwing another cartridge into place
wild with anger aching to deal with this
assassin the engineer forgot his shortening
wind and cha ged like a wild bull
  a vague figure moved in front of him
blurred by the gloomy shade of the big
rock carlton pulled trigger just as a big-
bore rifle delivered its thundering load
through his hat carlton pulled trigger
twice more the gusts of are and smoke
turned the place into a smelly inferno
  yow came a shrill agonized scream
from the figure in front
  carltons finger twitched on the trigger
but he refrained the man with the win-
chester hurled it away and let it smash on
the rocks while he hunched over and held
his right leg moaning
  what does this mean roared carlton
  oh ouch cried ebenezer finch
  he sat down and swayed while his lean
wtinkled face contorted with pain
  carlton did not know whether to shoot
strike swear or laugh the cold-blooded
attempt at assassination made him furious
but the ludicrous figure rendered him help-
less to act
  well he rasped
  it hurts complained finch wait
till i git my boot off ow wow
the boss of mirage

  serves you right snapped carlton
i ought to have finished you you dirty
sneak he stood undecided for a moment
swayed between humanity and inhumanity
but generosity won let me see that
leg humph flesh-wound too bad it
didnt drill your head cut away those
dirty clothes and give it a wash lick it if
you have to now take my bandanna and
bind it i ought to ram the thing down
your sneaking throat confound you why
didnt you fight like a man are you just
plain dog whats the idea in trying to
kill me anyhow or are you just trying
to scare me out of the valley speak
  finch quit binding the red wound for a
second and looked up with the old expres-
sion of vague reproach and wonderment
  you pizened them hosses came his
mournful regretful answer
  you lie
  taint fair whined finch ignoring
the outburst the first time i let it pass
youth will have its fling sez i so i let it
go next time eight yearlins was found
daid so i calclated id speak to you
friendly you only told me to git offn
your ranch this was with reproach un-
utterable  twamt neighborly i let
that go at last because i sez time heals all
wounds sez i then six four-year-olds
died las week an las night ten mewls
went and he nodded his head sadly at
thought of his wrongs
  you he blurted carlton you lie
im not poisoning horses
  you sez one day as haow youd git water
ef you hed to clean out me an that stock
accused finch most regretfully i was
right sorry peared that neighbors ought
to git along i was right hurt about it
ouch the last was addressed to the
leg
  the monotonous insistence of that querul-
ous voice was beginning to get in its work
carlton somehow felt himself on the de-
fensive and it maddened him
  you sniveling old crook he growled
you know whats the trouble as well as
i do
  finch shrugged a tired shoulder
  im right sorry abaout that water
he sighed seems jest like its only come
to make trouble between good neighbors
ef i could send that stock back id do it
but i haint got the money right naow
i m right sorry he wagged a mournful
head but his calculating little eyes rolled
up suddenly mebbe youd like to sell
your ranch back heh
 noting the look of cupidity in
 that foxy face carlton reversed
i the pistol and weighed the butt
in his hand as if wondering how deeply
it could crash into that mournful drooling
crooked head but he took it out in won-
dering finch seemed to keep the engi-
neers temper just at the border-line of
murder but carlton couldnt cross the line
he was angered perplexed and baffled
at length to save his own sanity he gave
it up
  can you walk he snarled
  i-i might make it said finch screw-
ing up his face dubiously my hoss is
right yonder on tother side of that brown
rock
  your getaway was well arranged ob-
served carlton dryly do you murder
many people in this way
  you pizened them hosses reiterated
finch in the same regretful voice i was
right sorry abaout it but-
  shut up screamed carlton you
say one more word and ill blow your head
off
  hypnotized though he was by that soft
sighing voice an overdose of it broke the
spell and now that he had cast off the
numbing influence he resolved to keep the
upper hand he knew he was just im-
pulsive enough to make good his threat and
he sought an excuse he longed for an excuse
but it never came and then carlton
wondered what to do with the man he
couldnt shoot him in cold blood he
couldnt kick a wounded man down the
hill he couldnt keep him on the hilltop
all night and he couldnt take him home
in a more civilized land he might have
finch arrested but that seemed out of the
question
  confound it puzzled the engineer
  finch seemed about to speak carltons
face showed a queer smile finch sensed
he was very near to eternity he clamped
his jaw and looked away carlton teetered
on his toes and then made his decision
  stand up and hop ordered the engi-
neer
  finch uncoiled his lanky frame and
hopped carlton helped him toward a
horse that whinnied from the shadow of a
	adventure
hot granite pillar and half-shoved half-
kicked him into the saddle while finch
yelped with pain when the job was com-
pleted carlton who had put the pistol into
its holster produced it again
  travel he ordered sternly git
vamose and if you ever start anything
with me again ill shoot on sight now
vanish
  finch shook his doleful head gathered
the reins clucked dismally and started
down the rocky hillside toward the green
valley below carlton stood and watched
until the figure was far down into the lower
reaches a dozen clever and snappy re-
marks came to his head now and yet in
finchs reproachful and nonresistant pres-
ence he knew his brain had bogged down as
usual-and now he had let the cold-blooded
old assassin go the thought made him
angry with himself
  he turned his face away from the pitiless
glare of the setting sun and looked down
the eastern side of the ridge into his little
garden of eden the western country
was gaunt and godless gray and yellow
dancing in the blur of the purple heat-wave
the valley was different pines clustered
in cool little groves under the side of the
copper mountain and their tiny springs
gave verdure to the ground immediately
beneath him
  far away the ranch-house and bams
and coops of ebenezer finch stood like
to placed on a carpet of green with
yellow haystacks here and there and peace-
ful animals grazing but somehow the
nearer lands at the lower end of the valley
looked yellower as if lacking something
a little verdant spot stood alongside
carltons tiny white house almost beneath
him but that was from a trickling spring
used mostly for drinking-water he con-
templated the place for a long time then
he turned away
  no water little money and no friends
except one rip-snorting old saloon-keeper
what am i going to do he asked of the
vast silence that seemed to mock him from
the treeless west
  he looked downward to the gaunt foot-
hills and their mystic purple ravines and
gulches spread before him for miles in-
hospitable and inscrutable as if enchanted
by demons this was the unmerciful
world outside the gates of his home and
his fate seemed to be driving him toward it
he could not leave the country for good
he knew his disease even though he was
conquering it the doctors had specified
the desert for him and the desert it must be
  it was only a question of happiness in
the valley of liis dreams or unhappiness
in the treeless waterless plains below
standing on the mountain-top and looking
into the sinister western lands tlie engineer
saw liis problem as plainly as if it were
written in two words yes or no
  no he resolved never if  have
to ill kill him thi is my home and mine
shell stay
  there was a new swing to carltons
shoulders a he ambled down the mountain-
side later he trudged toward the low-
lands and past a detached grove of pines
whistling in spite of the heat the shad-
ows of late afternoon were dimming the
sunlight and soon the air would le cooler
supper seemed to lje ready in the little
white-painted two-story cottage a wisp
of smoke curled from its chimney
  suddenly the man noticed a flash of blue
and white coming around the corner of the
house and running toward him the figure
seemed agitated slightly alarmed he
gained speed until he vaulted the little
fence that bounded his truck-garden where
his brown-eyed wife met him
  harry she cried clutching at him
  whats the matter
  i dont know what is it the horse
galloped in a long time ago with an empty
saddle she was almost breathless and
her eyes showed the strain she had under-
gone i thought of all sorts of horrible
things then finch rode by with his leg
bound up i called but he wouldnt stop
so i stopped him
 how
  her eyes snapped sternly
  i took down that rifle over the mantel
and pointed it at him
  great scott what did he do
  oh he grinned like an old wolf and
put up his hands he said youre larnin
maam and i said he would too then he
said birds of a feather flock together and
chuckled id forgotten to cock the ham-
mer of the rifle so i pulled it back with my
thumb the gun nearly went off it was
awful she took a long shuddering
breath i asked him where you were
and he said he didnt know he seemed
more polite may be that clicking sound

the boss of mirage		
did it he insisted he hadnt seen you
so at last  had to let him go he just left
then  really became worried
  the engineers brows were furrowed
  what a liar he is he exclaimed irri-
tably its like-like coping with an eel
did he say anything else-make any
threats
  n-no she seemed hesitant as if
loath to alarm him he said something
about widows weeds but i didnt quite
catch it nothing else much his talk
seemed to be rambling he said his best
horse died last night and a friend named
jim black was coming over to dicker about
some land he said black had advised
him not to sell you the ranch but he took
a chance on you and now hes sorry thats
about ail i guess
  all gasped carlton
  the news made him wonder if the odds
against him were not too great black
had a reputation
the man belonged to the second
oldest profession in the world
back in the shadowy ages of an-
tiquity the kings of a legendary egypt
employed his predecessors to do their
bidding cambyses claudius and nero
used them lavishly the byzantine em-
perors posted them on every street corner
and the age of the borgias lifted their
craftsmanship almost into the arts from
there they slowly declined in numbers and
power until today they are found only in
the toughest wards of the big cities or on
the last frontiers
  silent jim black was a professional
killer
  this rough-and-ready section of the
country whispered about black but could
prove nothing he never harmed any one
except in self-defense cleverly arranged
he was not a fire-eater it was not even
proven that he could be hired to kill it
was only apparent that often when two
men got into a quarrel one of them was
likely to run against jim black after the 
funeral black seemed a mite more pros-
perous but that might be coincidence
  the engineers wife felt there was some-
thing wrong she read it in her husbands
face
  whats the matter she asked is
black a dangerous man
  carlton played the game and put his arm
about her he had no intention of causing
alarm things were bad enough as they
were
  oh no he reassured her black is
one of the most suave and courteous per-
sons in the country
  but what is he doing with finch
  i dont know maybe ill find out
he replied with hidden sarcasm never
mind that lets get supper
  the wife sensed there was some cruel
play going on around her but her eastern-
trained mind could not gage it later as
the days passed the mystery became a
torment equal to the question of the
poisoned horses her husband daily
seemed more nervous and worried once
when finch happened by carlton hurried
inside and stood by his rifle again when
finch and a black-clad stranger rode about
the formers ranch the engineer lay under
a pine tree and with field-glasses watched
them until the tour was over
  later when the dark stranger rode by
alone and tossed a casual nod toward the
house carltons face went white and he
kept his hand near a holster behind the
doorway when jim black failed to make
the slightest hostile sign the engineer felt
like a fool
  that episode made things worse at
times carlton wondered if he were not a
mite too scary the engineer did not know
what to think so he puzzled and worried
until at length the strain and irritation
began to tell on him then his wife caught
the infection
  to cap the climax ebenezer finch began
to resume his visits when carlton was too
far afield to forestall him first he came
to borry something just as if nothing
had happened later he called to bewail
the loss of a prime white mare and twelve
mules by poison the visits kept the
young woman exasperated and nervous
though she felt that was what he aimed for
it looked like part of his campaign of terror-
ism she sensed that his evasive whining
wiseacre speech covered something sinister
and that he was watching watching like a
coiled snake biding its time to strike
  i cant stand it any longer she blurted
one october evening when she and carlton
were seated on the steps of their narrow
little porch
  i know nodded the engineer as he
puffed at his forbidden pipe and watched
io
adventure
the fading sunlight weave its red brocades
over the copper mountain neither
can i
  and yet she hesitated its glorious
she sniffed the cooling october air scented
from the pines and the dry grass and the
near-by rose-bushes finch offered eight
hundred dollars for the land she con-
cluded paradoxically then he offered
a little more
  it cost us eight thousand he stated
would you like to give it up
  no and yet-can we stay
  he took the pipe from his mouth and
seemed to be watching a humming-bird
as it studied a new honeysuckle vine
  maybe not he admitted if it
wasnt for the confounded mysteries maybe
we could whos been poisoning those
horses
  perhaps they were not poisoned at all
they were ive seen the dead ani-
mals
  well then they were she sighed i
give it up what can we do about it
ive got a plan ive been thinking it
over well go to town for a while ill
come and farm the place at odd times and
hire a few huskies to relieve me in guarding
it the engineer was really contemplating
an offensive wrar but of this he said nothing
in that way he explained we can run
the ranch and get away from this mystery
for how long have we money
enough
  i guess so maybe i can do a little land-
surveying outside anyhow the change
will do us good how about it
  but how can we leave with finch
watching us
  thats easy well get things packed
quietly and wait till he starts out some
morning for supplies hell leave abe
bilger that half-witted hired man of his
to guard the place well let him get well
started and then wtell follow on
  they discussed it all evening measuring
things from every angle but they had
decided beforehand they had come to
realize that their single-handed battle was
a little too much for them at present
they needed a respite thus it happened
that next day the wife got things in order
and then they awaited the passing of
finch black had disappeared from the
scene and almost from their minds
  two weeks later finch went by with
empty saddle-bags and grain-sacks dangling
from his horses sides he saw the glint of
carltons ready gun and kept at a respectful
distance ajter he left the valley the
engineer cautiously mounted the ridge to
make sure it was not some ruse but finch
kept on past cliffs and foot-hills till at
length his dust faded in the far white dis-
tance of the alkaline plains then carlton
descended to his home
  its after nine oclock he announced
lets hurry
  they took two saddle-horses and a pack-
inule loading them carefully they did
not want their departure to appear per-
manent then with everything ready
they trotted down the little lane and toward
the pass that led out of their valley of
dreams
  once at the gap they halted for a mo-
ment and the wife looked back wondering
if it were for the last time the gentle
october sunlight glorified fields pine-
groves oaks and w-iilows and the cool
breeze brought the gracious scent of pine
to their nostrils while the old copper moun-
tain gave them benediction from above
a meadow-lark sang them a little song a
bee hummed by the girls eyes moistened
from a queer homesickness but she turned
her horse resolutely and started onward
in
they arrived at the settlement
before dusk meeting only a few
cattlemen or prospectors on the way
carlton took his wife to the ramshackle
hotel for the time and then swung past
the seven saloons of the street to where
the porch of dolans dance-hall and general
merchandise store jutted into a turn of the
road
  a pianist was practising for the evenings
noise and the quavery banging floated out
of many windows past the dozen loungers
squatted on the wide porch or leaning
against hitching-posts as they performed
their evening ask of watching the darkness
arrive inside another dozen was gathered
about the bar near the wide door dolans
heavy bass voice floated out giving direc-
tions about trimming the lamps wtien
carlton ambled in dolan in shirt-sleeves
as usual dropped a rag and grabbed his
hand
well he roared you still on earth
the boss of mirage
how goes it he pulled carlton forward
as if he were a doll come back to a table
and have a drink not drinkin today
hey well have a drink anyhow and
with great gusto he yanked the engineer
toward a seat near a window in the rear
room while the hangers-on laughed
  dolans attitude changed when he had
carlton seated in the corner he muffled
his voice somewhat
  you darned fool he rasped what
did you come here for -
why whats the matter
  matter huh-if jim black sees you-
good night hes after you
the engineer felt his heart thump
strange- he pondered a moment then
why should he be seeking me now
he needs money he gits it from
fitch-provided see
  provided gulped carlton provided
he does the work that is i see he
stopped and tried to figure it all out
then if i go black gets the ranch i see
thats about what finch hinted one day
when he met my wife
  then he lied as usual contradicted
dolan
 how
  huh think finch wants black for
a neighbor nix not ncin too dan-
gerous black gits cash
  the more carlton studied the transaction
the less natural it seemed that sort of
business might be all right for the old lhugs
of india or the mandarins of china but the
thought of paid assassination in the civilized
year of  in the state of california
seemed like a strain on the imagination
though dolans bailiwick was in the wildest
and most lawless section of a go-as-you-
please county it took only three days to
reach the railroad and then the big modem
cities were in easy reach even here
their influence was felt dolan was
thinking of installing a telephone
  its nonsense blurted the engineer
its a plot to scare me out
  carlton looked at the saloon-keeper
queerly for an instant dolan had tried
to alarm him might it be-could it be-
that dolan was also in the plot anything
seemed possible did this saloon-keeper
size him up for a tenderfoot after all-just
another sucker to be trimmed carlton
was not naturally suspicious but he
was not wholly well yet and of late he
had been filled with many perplexities
  sure its a plot said dolan tiredly
if they skeer you out so much the better
if not you git out anyhow see thats
where black comes in finch means busi-
ness you hit him with a rail his hosses
are pizened you shot hira i hear hes
mad before that it wasnt personal
you was only another sucker now its
persnal see
  but argued carlton black was in the
valley several times he didnt start any-
thing
  why should he no witnesses there
he couldnt prove self-defense your wife
was always around it has to be public
see
  the engineer found his throat welling
and his lingers drumming on the table
nervously the lamps of the dance-hall
were being hung but he only saw them as
glassy blurs he knew his face was white
but he was able to meet dolans shrewd
gaze unflinchingly there wras even de-
fiance in his eyes the big man nodded
  are-are you sure of all this insisted
the groping carlton
  certain finch came in several weeks
ago drank too much of looey bums
snake-juice dolan jerked his finger in
the direction of a rival sin-palace he
told looey about his friend black said
black wras likely to git somebody soon
said it was all fixed said therevi be one
less pest in lost deet valley- that meant
you then he went to sleep under a table
forgot all about it looev told me next
evenin perfeshnul courtesy between sa-
loon-owners yes i said courtesy we
have to keep tabs on people a mans
credit may be no good if he hangs around
too long hell bust you its business
  carlton began to see into things he had
never dreamed of he had stumbled upon
a regular coordinated information-bureau
  then who has been poisoning finchs
horses he demanded
  i dont know admitted dolan i
got my suspicions but i aint sure yet
why the devil didnt you stay away and
gimme time to w-ork things out the
boss scratched his head now finch is
in town blacks here youre here its
all mixed up the devil only knows how
its cornin out
  well announced carlton im not
going to run anyhow

adventure
  no only lay low no use to look for
trouble blacks deadly lay low
  with this kindly admonition the giant
started to get up and go about his business
but something in carltons face arrested
him the engineer two shades paler was
looking at something far past the boss
dolan turned and peered around
beyond the loafers at the bar
beyond the wide doorway beyond
the hitching-posts and the dusty
roadway tlie dark immaculate figure of
jim black was seen passing a small knot
of men and ambling toward dolans door
he stopped and nodded to some one then
he sauntered onward carlton had hold of
his chair and was staring as if fascinated
  lay low advised dolan sit tight
it might not come now anyhow
  but carltons jaw was set at last and he
started to arise he had come to the end
of the road the long siege of worry and
doubt and fear and nervous tension had
caused something to snap within him and
though his teeth were chattering he had
cast the die he was afraid-scared blue-
but going forward the eyes of the tough
old boss showed an admiring glint and he
resolved to save this man from the results
of his own stubborn courage
  sit down ordered dolan
  i wont
  you will snapped the boss laying a
mighty hand on his shoulder nix on
this hero stuff lay low
  carltons eyes were suddenly hard and
cold
  let go of me he demanded get
out of my way	
  the boss hesitated only for an instant
then he grabbed the engineers right arm
and twisted it as if in a vise
  dont speak to me like that he snarled
who do you think you are come on
you youre goin into that linen-closet
and he grabbed carl ton by the scruff of his
neck
  what exploded the outraged engineer
savagely angry at last why you -
  shut up roared the saloon-keeper
suddenly the crowd outside the front
door jumped they scattered pell-mell
two men in the semigloom rushed around
an outside corner and cowered behind the
wall of the building another yelled and
got behind a hitching-post sudden shouts
and the scuffle of feet told of an instan-
taneous crisis outside people were rush-
ing to get out of line from something
dolan knew the symptoms and halted un-
decided
  a pistol cracked outside the window that
faced the side road a piercing cry was
heard-then another shot then silence-
the queer deathly silence that follows a
tragedy
  the bystanders started running forward
away from the saloon dolan rushed to the
side window drawing carlton with him
the boss peered out to the roadway in
front of an old blacksmith-shop opposite
a prone figure was king face forward
wiui arms outstretched grotesquely an-
other figure was sitting near by sagging
forward and nursing a shoulder men
came running up from every direction
  its done grunted dolan releasing
the engineer
  what is
  the old boss pointed a pudgy finger to-
ward the prone figure
  know who that is he asked
   the engineer looked closer
  its ebenezer finch he cried almost
unbelieving
  right finch it is died game any-
how he shot back cornered i guess
had to be game know the other feller
  the bewildered engineer looked long and
hard he had seen that middle-sized fig-
ure somewhere but couldnt quite place
him
  thats tom fulton announced the
boss
  fulton fulton you mean the man
that used to own my ranch never met
liim and yet he seems familiar at that
  jim black was lifting the suffering man
but black was an afterthought
  sure you seen fulton boomed dolans
voice remember the day you was here
last member the coot that came in
full of licker wanted to lick all creation
got thrown out that wras fulton
  carlton began to grope there was
something underneath it all but he could
not grasp it dolan suddenly appeared as
satisfied as a cat full of cream
  this here tragedy cost me about twenty
dollars announced the big saloon-keeper
quite casually
  carlton became even more befuddled
  twenty how he asked
the boss of mirage

  keepin fulton full of dutch courage
replied the amiable old thug he used
to own your ranch got froze out like you
woke up too late swore hed kill finch
didnt make good got sick went broke
and drifted away i forgot all about it
he  didnt came back here after five
years worked up his courage with licker
tried to git himself up to the killin-point
got too noisy and i threw him out
  then you reminded me who he was
you told me whod owned your ranch
before you you mentioned tom fulton
then i knew him after you left i went
after him i sort of have it in for finch
myself fulton told me all his troubles
got sympathy also licker buckets of
it got more courage every day waited
for finch finch arrived today funeral
tomorrow
iv
it was terse and to the point but
carlton felt his hair curling this
broad-shouldered black-haired giant
in front of him had arranged a killing
as casually as he would prepare a fishing
excursion he even furnished the bait
the engineer found himself dizzy
  the old boss read his thoughts
  for the public good he grunted
finch was a pest always in trouble
always snivelin always cheatin ive
been waitin for some one to put him out
now im glad hes gone
  so was carlton in a way but his soul
had not yet risen to such heights of altruis-
tic manslaughter and the chills were running
down his spine he was brave enough but
this was different he changed the subject
abruptly
  then maybe fulton poisoned those
horses he surmised
  mebbe he went away mysterious
several times he promised to do some-
thin desprate thats about his size-
pizenin dumb animals mebbe if i wanted
proof i could git it but-whats the use
i dont care a hoot either way
  there was a wealth of scorn in dolans
voice in commenting upon his tool and the
the engineer realized how masterfully the
drunkard had been managed while carl-
ton was away in his valley a little drama
had been staged in this rough pine-board
colony with john barleycorn as a prime
actor and himself as beneficiary-and do-
lan as stage-manager carlton realized
that the big boss had mainly told him
the truth he had supplied the shooting
because he despised finch naturally be-
cause of the general public good because he
wanted to see a fight and partially because
of carlton then another thought crossed
the engineers mind
  by the way he asked how about jim
black what is he going to do
  dolans reply was prompt
  nothin why should he finch is
dead the deals off this shootin leaves
black up in the air nothin in it for him
is there hes got nothin against you
personal has he
  it sounds reasonable conceded the
engineer
  here in the dusk with the last faint
traces of red in the western sky it seemed
that a great burden was lifted off his shoul-
ders even though he did not exactly ap-
prove of the method he felt that his life
seemed clear from now on and he could
live forever with his bride in the valley of
his hearts delight with the old copper
mountain giving them benediction to the
end with his heart swelling the engineer
turned away from the wrinkled face of the
sordid crafty loyal old thug who had
befriended him he absently looked out-
side to where groups of men stood about
the actors in the pitiful tragedy and then
his dreams vanished
  the crowd in front of finch had thinned
slightly and the glimmer of a lantern
showed his head being raised on jim
blacks knee while another man was
sponging his hair where a dark stream was
flowing from above the ear
  finchs face was almost demoniac as the
lantern cast its lights and shadows upon the
sharp features and from his mouth there
issued a volley of profanity that seemed to
flicker the light with its blasts nearer
another group was putting tom fulton on
a shutter lifting him with rough tenderness
beyond the groups of men lights from
looeys place and the other saloons down
the street gave vague illumination to the
roadway while the music of a tinny piano
jangled from one of them playing a coon
song as if nothing had happened but
above all came that high-pitched jabber
of ebenezer finch very much alive it
was not soft and regretful now it was
adventure
explosive among other things it shrieked
gimme my gun and lemme at him
no came uie voice of jim black dur-
ing a silence stop that wait till you
get tended to
  a murmur of voices followed broken by
another shrieking volley of wildcat profanity
but the writhing form of the wounded
tom fulton had been carried out of sight
and finch had not seen him
  carlton noting with interest tfiat finch
had taken on another ieud felt queerly like
a front-seat spectator in a show arranged
for his benefit as he looked out of the win-
dow dolan standing alongside him
seemed angry
  - boomed the heavy voice of the
boss at length in infinite disgust rotten
job rotten and that was all he could
say
  a prospector came through the talking
crowd at dolans doorway and approached
the boss bringing news
  didja see it he chirped a fella
named fulton met old finch in the road-
way and cussed him out he peared to be
drunk he reached for his gun an so did
finch finch shot him in the shoulder
an he shot finch in the head they was
so close they jest couldnt miss
  huh what was the trouble asked
dolan innocently
  the prospectors face looked perplexed
trdarned if i know he answered mebbe
its some one that finch skinned
  how asked the boss
  i dont know answered the puzzled
prospector somethin was said about a
ranch but that was all i got
  the desert-rat seemed aggrieved about it
after a long lonely trip through unlimited
wastes where he and his burro had probably
suffered all sorts of hardships he had
witnessed a bang-up fight and didnt un-
derstand all about the matter thus feeling
deprived of something he did not know
fulton few did the male population
drifted in and out continually-and five
years is a long time men did not generally
know each other very well in this country 
is finch hurt bad asked the boss
  i dunno somebody went after doc
davis and mebbe well see theres the
old doc now and the prospector ran
away to keep tab on the latest develop-
ments
  a stocky man with a warty face and a
bulbous nose ambled gravely toward the
recumbent finch the crowd made way
for him as with gestures of professional
interest the elderly arrival examined the
wound and gave a few terse directions to
the bystanders dan dolan chuckled
  its all right now doc davis has got
the case finchll die
  the engineer looked nonplussed
hoss-doctor explained dolan good
man once but went wrong came from
new york had troubles drowned em
been drownin em ever since if finch is
hurt bad hell die
somehow carlton could not fall
into this mood dolan might hate
like that but the engineer couldnl
the engineer failed to realize that dolan
looked on finch as one might look on a
snake or any other pest which one did not
hate but simply struck on general principles
without realizing it fully dolan busy with
engrossing business and political fights
had despised the old hypocrite for years but
never thought much about it until a man
he liked became a victim now he was
taking notice with a vengeance
  if davis is loaded enough hell operate
added the boss thats him if hes
sober he lets the patient alone patient
recovers if hes full he wants to show off
tackles anything hed operate on the
angel gabriel and dolans calculating
gaze went to the bottles stacked behind his
busy bar
  dont advised carlton isnt there
any other doctor around here
  dolan looked a little disappointed at this
squeamishness
  nope he replied tersely theres
three at the county-seat none here but
davis no use to bring in another doctor
finch aint worth it
  the engineer felt properly rebuked
well he decided cautiously anyhow
maybe its best to be neutral let em
alone let davis kill or cure that
makes it a sporting proposition
  carlton calculated that the sporting ele-
ment would appeal to dolan and it did
  fair enough acceded the boss ill
bet you ten he dies
  done
  a glance through the window showed
that finch had been carried somewhere out
of sight the side street was deserted
the boss of mirage

again except for its tethered horses and the
jangle of piano music it was just as if
nothing had happened dolan and carlton
ambled toward the front of the place get-
ting out of the way for the dance about to
start a few tired-looking girls had ap-
peared long before and mingled with the
crowd of prospectors miners ranchers and
cattlemen from every part of the hills a
piano a fiddle and a bass-drum had been
tuning up the board walls were beginning
to rattle at the noise and pictures of ac-
tresses culled from the sporting journals
were vibrating
  the portly doctor davis came in at
length strutting importantly at the head of
a retinue dolans practised eye estimated
he was half-sober wliile those at the bar
plied the medical man with questions
  all he needs is a little time and nursing
announced the professional man  the
bullet struck the temporal bone went along
the screamous portion glanced off the more
peetreus tracts and avoided the mastoid
making a welt a track or what might be
called a crease except for possible con-
cussion genlemen i doubt that any ma-
terial complications can occur he is rest-
ing easy at the hotel
  ed hendry from the willow creek
country leaned his tall frame against the
bar and voiced his curiosity loudl
  what made him yell like a wildcat when
he came to
  delirum responded the doctor courte-
ously perfectly natural any one gets
twisted around after a blow like that
why one-half an inch more and hed have
been dead
huh thats the first time finch ever
let himself out commented the rancher
he usully snivels did he git over it
hes calmed down now admitted the
doctor friend of yours
  no snapped hendry
  ah said the horse-doctor changing the
subject tactfully bartender set em up
your pleasure genlemen every one
  but dan dolan was loyal to his bet
no he countermanded no drinks
for the doc everybody but the doctor
the crowd turned the insulted veter-
inarian sputtered
  why he demanded
  no drinks till finch is out of danger
hendry the willow creek rancher
turned around and faced dolan
  is finch a friend of yours he inter-
posed very quietly
  the boss bristled
  whats it to you
  the ranchers face whitened but he faced
dolan without flinching
  then youre through he flared i
knew finch in escalante if youre a
friend of his youre a low-down sneakin
lyin hoss-stealin skunk that a decent
rattlesnake wouldnt be seen in company
with why you-
  the boss could not hesitate before an
audience like this it was a matter of
prestige decided instantly the mighty
fist of dan dolan crashed into hendrys
face and whirled him backward into the
horse-doctor the smack sounded like an
ax hitting a tree the rancher and the
mcdical man rolled to the sawdust together
  the crowd parted as if by magic dolan
stood alone fist clenched facing the prone
man two other willow creek men sidled
in facing dolan wrathfully
  want some too roared the boss
  one of them grabbed his arm he did
not argue he shoved the man aside
the other reached downward toward his
belt quick as light the giant rushed him
and planted a pole-ax blow into his face
that man also fell to the floor
  some one yelled the place became tu-
multuous carlton edged toward the boss
loyally but dolan needed no help he
stooped over quickly and disarmed the man
who had reached downward then he
stood up with a gleaming six-shooter in
his hand
  any one else want in he roared look-
ing around truculently
  no one volunteered some of the crowd
even drew back the boss satisfied
walked over to the first man he had struck
ed hendry of willow creek was just com-
ing to the horse-doctor was fanning him
  here said the boss pulling hendry to
his feet git out
  he led the unresisting man to the door
and gave him a gentle shove then he re-
turned and picked up the second victim
shook him a bit and helped him to the
door also it had all happened within a
minute
  all right cried the boss waving his
hand to the crowd in the dance-hall
tracks clear on with the dance strike
up the music
i
adventure
  the music obeyed with great alacrity
  carlton had been a silent bystander and
in a way he wondered what this giant might
do next when the boss approached he
was in a thundering black mood his first
remark was wrathful but utterly unex-
pected	m 
  now im agin finch for fair he an-
nounced taint your light alone now
its mine
  carlton was thunderstruck at this atti-
tude
  how he blurted
  huh finch started all lhe trouble in
the first place didnt he
  yes
  well now hes lost me three good cus-
tomers
v
     harry carlton did not sleep
very well that night his experien-
 - ces had brought him into a depres-
sive mood it was not that he had lost out
it was not that he lacked loyal backing it
was because of his environment and the
sordidness of it and a species of homesick-
ness that had come over him carlton did
not feel above his fellows but they were
different so that the roughness and harsh-
ness of this land and its people made him
wonder if it were worth while to continue
among them even though his conquered
disease demanded it
  the town was a hole-in-the-mud place
the highest ideal of most of its inhabitants
was to win enough money at gambling to
keep cold drunk the town was called
mirage apt name it was illusory un-
stable unreliable a though it had lived
forty years it still had the unpainted un-
kempt appearance of a camp that might
blow away any minute and was not worth
improving
  and carlton was most worried about his
wife now that he had her in town what
could he do with her for the present they
had taken quarters at the hotel made from
a defunct dance-hall where thin board
partitions had been nailed to make rooms
for her there were no women to associate
with no amusement no little conveniences
the hotel was used mainly by drunks
sleeping off their sprees the place was
sordid and makeshift and depressing the
whole atmosphere of the town for a fine
young eastern girl was impossible-im-
possible
  hi the sunlight of the next day it seemed
even worse the signs on the cheap board
fronts of the cheap board saloons and the
chinese restaurant and the old red black-
smith shop were half obliterated by the hot
suns of forty years dolans place with
the windows unwashed and fly-specked
looked dilapidated and sodden and cheer-
less beyond the turn of the road at do-
lans the hot treeless spurs of gaunt moun-
tains sloped down into unlimited wastes of
hot treeless waterless plains that seemed
to stretch on forever carlton began to
curse the folly and the illusions that brought
him into this country
  although the engineer did not know it
he was suffering the maladies that come to
every secondary pioneer the first pioneers
had come to this land and given their
natural wildness full sway turning it into
a free-for-all hell and ignoring its possibili-
ties had carlton understood he might
like the far-seeing dolan have visioned
himself clearly as among the first of the new
pioneers in this corner of the county-the
earnest decent settlers who within ten
years were to transform the old west into
the new west and make it a land of pros-
perous homes schools auto roads giant
irrigation systems and clean little towns
  carlton could not peer ahead and see the
great dam with which the government was
to impound waters far in the mountains so
that this desert would be forever blessed
as an engineer he knew the possibilities of
the country- in a vague way but reality lay
in the future he did not even fully realize
that the rest of the county was slowly com-
ing from its long sleep and that only in this
section was the last frontier he only
knew he was disgusted and incredibly
lonely he had not been so in his own
valley that was his own
  you cant stand much of this he an-
nounced to his wife in the morning as he
looked at the bare board walls of his room
while the partitions echoed snores from
other boudoirs
  why not she asked
 why not with nothing to do no
place to go no one to talk to i ought to
have thought of that before we came
why itll kill you
  well youre here arent you
  it was simply said but it made carlton
the boss of mirage

tingle the doubts and depressions were
swept away instantly as if banished by a
fairy hand the knowledge that he pos-
sessed this beautiful girl made him realize
that even though perplexities sprang up on
every side his game was worth playing
and then immediately another distraction
made his brows wrinkle how long could
this beautiful young wife go about such
a place without complications starting
carlton knew the general chivalry of the
west but he also knew the free-and-easy
attitude of men accustomed to dance-hall
girls and the less free-and-easy ideas of
certain others who were not accustomed to
being balked
  the first complication along these lines
came late in the afternoon when carlton
returned to the hotel after looking over some
men who might assist him to hold his little
valley his wife was seated on the ve-
randa and alongside her was the quiet
well-mannered jim black
  black arose courteously when the en-
gineer arrived and the engineer seated him-
self feeling that black was just a bit enter-
prising
  mr black has just been telling me about
anam and hue explained the wife with a
smile
  what
  anam and hue and bangkok and singa-
pore and a lot of other places mr black
has been all over the orient she said it
as if she had made a find
  the engineers eyes narrowed he knew
from many instances how the east coast
blunts the morals of all but the strongest of
men and he began to appraise black better
black was a westerner all right but he did
not fit into this settlement he belonged
in some seaport town like san francisco or
seattle yet he had been here for a long
time what was the answer what was
he hiding from
  and silent jim had been talkative
  id like to hear of mr blacks travels-
all of them said carlton with malicious
courtesy
  blacks cold gray eyes flashed sideways
for an instant but his reply was peace-
ful
  pleased to some day he replied
arising ill have to move along now
got to see a friend good day mrs carl-
ton good day carlton and tipping
his hat he was off

  there was a long period of silence on the
porch
  hes a mystery to me said the wife
at length
  to every one grunted carlton he
produced a pipe and started filling it i
guess its best to let him alone he con-
cluded
  the girls brown eyes flickered as she
considered this
  well she offered he seems to be
about the best in the camp
  maybe still it might be wise to let
him alone i dont trust him
  neither do i exactly she admitted
thats why im curious about him
theres something-something going on
somewhere and hes in it and i dont know
what it is
  the engineer smiled grimly
  you mean you want to pump him
   might be able to
  the calm optimism of this innocent young
girl made carlton gulp he changed his
tactics
  know what a bobcat is he asked
suddenly its a lynx-a wildcat highly
excitable weil if you want a real good
time go get a nice lively one bring it up
close to you and then ask it questions
its no more dangerous than fooling with
jim black and youll get just as much
information
dan dolan however tried it in
his own way and got something
he was not really hoping for infor-
mation but anything that came into his
net was welcome he and black hap-
pened to get together two days after
carlton came to town and they sat at
dolans back-room table where the boss
spun his webs
  hows finch gittin along asked
dolan casually over a glass of beer
  dunno said black
  they say hes got eary-sipilis volun-
teered the boss pizen theres dirt in
the wound
  black nodded
  bum doctor continued the boss
  black nodded again
  doctor probly let dirt git in offered
dolan new doctor cornin from down-
country to look him over finchll probly
git well
  black lifted a beer glass to his mouth
i
adventure
 i wish finchd gil out of town snapped
 the boss
why
 yells and moans all night gittin
 worse hurts the hotel people cant
 sleep i own a half-interest in the hotel
 blacks eyes flickered at this barbarous
 commercialism but still he said nothing
 that noise must be hard on the carlton
 gal added the boss darned shame
 no way to treat a lady like that fine gal
 aint she
 black nodded again
 worth havin remarked the boss
 looking crafty bet if there wasnt nothin
 in the way a young feller like youd take a
 chance
 black nodded again the boss looked
 at him curiously
 if an accident hit that carlton feller
 thered be a scramble all right observed
 the boss very casually he waited for
 some remark but none came best-
 lookin ally that ever come to town he
 finished
 black looked wearied dolan changed
 the subject
 think finch may be all right soon
 he asked
 black sat back in his chair
 why do you ask me he demanded
 oh i thought you was interested saw
 you stand by him when he was shot you
 took him to the hotel
 oh
 if he gits away then he wont disturb
 the hotel said the boss fact is im
 tired of him wish hed go fer keeps hes
 a pest id help put up a purse to plant
 him jest for the public good
 blacks gaze became direct and cold
 not while im here he stated
 the boss was taken aback this man
 black was believed to be for hire and yet
 here he turned down a bid the boss knew
 that finch would not pay top prices for
 any job dolan could easily beat finchs
 bid and yet black had turned him down-
 cold
 why asked the boss bluntly
 friend of mine snapped black
 how persisted dolan
 helped me once
 the boss looked curious he knew that
 if finch lived black would probably carry-
 out his lethal contract against the engineer
 but here was an angle that was hard to
understand dolan assumed his most in
gratia ting air and leaned forward
  how he asked
  black looked half-defiant but he let the
words come to his mouth
  two years ago i was broke sister
dying in chicago also broke only rela-
tive  had best friend i ever had sick
and down and out pleaded for help i
went crazy got desperate started oul
with a gun to collect new game for me-
dont like hold-ups caught finch on the
road got fifty dollars  had a mask
but he rccnized me i said i had  have
the money  he quit yelping and asked
me why i told him id have told any
one then he said keep the fifty
then he took me to his ranch and gave me
fifteen hundred dollars
  the boss was staggered such a tale
about the crooked old miser of lost deer
valley was incredible
  it went to your sister gasped dolan
  she died happy
  and finch loaned it
  no he gave it
vi
the boss nearly fell over the
thought of the old miser of lost
deer valley giving fifteen hundred
dollars to any one was incredible-unthink-
able black must le lying if not   
  dolans eyes narrowed at a new thought
  that was two years ago he asked
  black nodded
  the boss lashed his memory for the
episodes of two years back black had
been present for three years in the first
one he had acquired a big part of his repu-
tation the boss remembered blacks
initial battle staged right by the bar of
this dance-hall there were a few low-
voiced sentences between black and some
cattleman then a quick reach for guns
when the lightning of jim blacks pistol
had struck the cattleman was beyond
talking forever what it was all about
nobody ever knew they only saw that
black had fired in legitimate self-defense
where delay would have been fatal and
then there were other episodes-several of
them
  my fault apologized the boss mostly
to himself i oughta kept better track
of tilings 
the boss of mirage

  of course finch had paid black the
money if dolan were the most vicious
old miser in the county and saw a chance
to put under obligations a prize gunman
dolan might have done the same thing
even though the cost broke his heart the
bfls was beginning to see into things he had
never dreamed of before he had known
finch casually as he knew many others
but that was all
  the wily old boss however knew the
political line-ups in the county and he
knew of certain things that had happened
recently in his vicinity certain episodes
for instance where men with property had
vanished he felt now that black was
implicated in some of them also finch
he put two and two together and made a
staggering total but he was not sure yet
he wished now that he had been less frank
in expressing enmity to finch he felt
that if apparently neutral he might have
learned more
  but the boss had declared war so he
decided to stand pat
  ive got friends too said the giant
quite frankly im a good deal like you
if anything happened to some of em id
be sorry darned sorry mebbe id grieve
too much and git excited then thered be
regrets all around
  blacks gray eyes showed a flicker but
he arose quite easily and stretched himself
  thats the way it goes he nodded
well ill be going along got to see a
friend so long
  the boss understood and so did black
the big man now realized that if it were
just an ordinary squabble about that little
lost deer valley things might have been
arranged with honor to both sides- but
black had been elusive it showed that a
deliberate program of some sort was being
carried out
  beyond dolans doorway stood eighteen
horses and mules hitched to a great wagon
that drew a trailer almost as large as itself-
one of the many counterparts of the
twenty-mule team now advertised all
over the country twenty mules were
nothing remarkable here this outfit was
one of dolans freight-teams that voyaged
across the dusty desert miles to the far-
away branch-line railroad bringing in
merchandise and mails and taking out the
assorted products of small mines and a few
scattered ranches to this equipage dolan
soon made his way holding an envelope
in his hand
  do you know bill campbell down at
the county-seat he asked the driver
  the teamster rolled a quid of tobacco
in his hair-hidden mouth and said he wasnt
quite sure
  hes a lawyer said the boss got an
office in that shanty across from the court-
house tall feller good-lookin light
hair give him this savvy
  yeh responded the teamster indiffer-
ently
  paste it in your hat roared the boss
that letter goes see dont forgit
it
  in a land where ever- one is a free citizen
mandates do not go a city delivery-man
takes orders a desert freighter is likely
to wave a hand to the team and say take
em a freighter is a high professional
man with a temperament like a grand-opera
prima-donna he knows his own value
this one looked at the boss speculatively
for a moment but decided at length to
accede to the request thus caleb snow
teamster pushed into the desert with the
missive in his hat he started after noon
so as to reach by evening a certain water-
hole from which he could best start for the
rest of the journey dolan had a regular
schedule for his freight-teams
the boss met carlton the next day
in the general merchandise store
where dolan generally put in a few
hours supervising his sallow clerk a waif
he had picked up from nowhere and tried to
train into usefulness the boss stood at
the hardware counter while mrs carlton
inspected some bolts of cloth at the tiny
clry-goods nook
  fine gal opened dolan to carlton
pointing with his thumb to the wife
  the engineer agreed with a nod wonder-
ing what was coming next
  how does she like it here
  oh so-so
  lonely for her admitted the boss
how does she like black
  not much why
  how long before you can git back to the
valley asked the boss ignoring the others
question
  about two days as soon as jerry
martin and bob arnold can get ready to
go with me why

adventure
  then take the wife along
  carlton read a warning in it
  whats the idea he asked
  jim black been watchin him
finchll probly git well coin to a hos-
pital down below mebbe may git well
savvy
  you mean
  i dunno not sure anyhow git her
out of town if black likes her theres
trouble if not means trouble anyhow
mebbe black might hang around a woman
jest to start somethin husband flies off
the handle mebbe brings things to a
show-down savvy
  oh-rats it sounds too far-fetched
the eyes of the old boss narrowed under
their heavy brows
  sure he admitted sounds like melly-
drammy only lets suppose things
spose you was an old crook used a fine
valley to trap suckers trapped a lot
then a sucker came along who wouldnt
suck fought it out shot you in the leg
hit you with a fence-rail watched you
all the time with field-glasses and spose
you had a gunman obliged to you for favors
then what the boss concluded very
slowly making each word tell and spose
you was doin a lot of other queer business
and this young sucker was livin a mite too
close to you
  great scott said carlton but what
is this other business
  dunno mebbe ill find out soon sent
a letter down to the county-seat to a law-
yer
  you dealing with a lawyer
  yep gotta git information i work
through bill campbell on the quiet
im in bad with the county gang down
below
  county gang 
  sure office-holders they dont like
me sheriff came up here once to git a
man the man was innocent i kicked
the sheriff out the district attorney came
i kicked him out deputy sheriffs came
they got kicked out too
  carlton visualized the exciting picture
  alone he asked
  no i had a few huskies with me
held off the whole mob till we compermised
they got the party they wanted gave
him a legal trial freed him accordin to
agreement t was made a deputy sheriff
i am yet they keep outa here i keep
outa there it works fine more or less
that is
  the engineer was getting a real insight
into the old saloou-mans power here in
this last frontier where the armed men of
the old west still flourished dan dolan was
judge jury and executioner the lawsf
a county and a state were dispensed-or
dispensed with-according to agreements
made after a free-for-all fight and yet it
seemed in keeping it was as natural to
i his country as its sage-brush its rattle-
snakes its heat and its careless population
  huh commented the engineer it
must be a line gang of politicians down at
the county-seat
  fine gang is right grunted the boss
cheap crooks held office too long
think they can git away with anything
some day theyll wake up but they let
me alone im not in on their deals theyre
out of mine peace rules-mebbe think
youll take the wife back to your ranch
  i dont know considered carlton
maybe i will id like to have her with
me anyhow
  got plenty money
  couple of thousand left i guess i can
pull through
  plenty more if you want it your
credits good with me go as far as vou
like
  thanks
  glad of the backing but not wishing to
take advantage of it unless necessary
carlton was about to join his wife who
looked as if she had heard much of the
conversation she opened her lips to say
something just as a husky excited man in
corduroys and blue shirt came clattering
through the doorway
  hey dolan he bawled heard the
news
 no what
  cale snow your leamster was shot dead
at mesquite springs
vn
the boss slammed a fist on the
counter in an instant his face was
red with wrath the cords on his
bull neck were swollen while his eyes seemed
like lambent flames the air seemed to be
charged with electricity
  who did il he thundered tell me-
quick
the boss of mirage

  i dont know said the informant
bob lange he was ridin by the springs
when he-
  wheres lange
  guess hes over at tobys place he
 jest got in
  go git him
  the informant jumped out the boss
occupied with his own sulfuric thoughts
started walking up and down the one aisle
of his store forgetting carlton and every-
thing else dolans little clerk who had
been writing in a small cage peered over
his desk nervously
  gee he gulped somebodys in for
 it
  carlton and his wife turned toward him
 somebody hurt one of the bosss teams-
 ters before said the awestricken clerk
 the boss caught the feller that done it
 and broke him in two with his hands
 dolan happened to look around the
 clerk ducked his head again just as two
 men came through the front door together
 one was the informant and the other was
 a short stocky round-faced man with the
 bow legs of a seasoned rider the boss
 seemed to shoot a question straight into
 his face
  lange who shot snow
   dunno
  whered you find him
  right alongside the spring under the
 mesquite
  killed
  he cashed in about an hour after i
arrived
  when did you git there
  this momin
  where was aleck jordan this ap-
parently referred to snows assistant some
one usually accompanies every desert-
freighter
   dunno no trace of him
  ran away i oughta known it white-
livered skunk -me if i ever see him
 again hell jun all right wtiere was the
 team
  right by the wagons with feed-bags
 still on em the harness was off my
 pardners bringin em in we rode up to
 the wells this morn in and there was that
 team with nobody tendin em that
 looked queer so i hollered somebody
 gurgled from the well-you know that
 little spring under the mesquite-and so i
 went hootin over there snow was lyin
 on his side with red under his chest he
 said dolan then he stopped after
 id washed him some he said
   they come up behind me last
night two of em in masks they
made jordan hop into the desert then
they took away my money and a letter in my
hat that was about all he had a piece
of red bandanna in his hand-here it is
from what i gather they stopped and held
him up probly they took his gun away
mebbe he had another under the wagon-
seat he made a break for the wagon i
guess and then they tried to stop him
there was signs of a struggle by the wheels
then he must a reached for the other
fellows gun and got plugged he got
some of the mask though see it
  the stranger handed over a piece of red
bandanna with an exaggerated fleur-de-lis
pattern torn on two sides the boss
grabbed it savagely with a queer expres-
sion on his face carlton saw something
was coming and turned to his wife
  go back to the hotel he whispered
the girl looked curious but thought it
best to accede
  the boss was in a storming rage by now
he did not notice her going he did not
notice anything except that piece of red
bandanna he looked at it closely and
then a cruel smile came to his face
  wheres tom yager he asked the
informant suddenly
  over at the hotel sleepin off last
nights drunk
  wheres axel yager
  i dunno the informants eyes turned
toward the other jnan wasnt he over
at looey bums he asked seems like
i seen him a short time ago
  yeh said the other
  go over and git him ordered dolan
to lange the short man tell him i
want to see liim about them samples from
his minin claim
  the messenger was apparently a trusted
friend of dolans and ran out willingly
the boss started pacing up and down the
aisle again like an angry lion shaking his
shaggy head and clenching his great fists
carlton kept out of his wav
  after a time the messenger returned with
another man-a gangling stoop-shouldered
desert-rat with shifty blue eyes and faded
overalls hanging by one sweaty gallus
dolan seemed to control himself instantly

adventure
when the newcomer entered there was
a set smile on the bosss face and he almost
purred the other men got away from
him looking nervous
   lo yager greeted dolan where
you been lately aint seen you much
  the other answered laconically and his
side-shifting eyes showed he was ill at ease
  been up to the mine lately purred the
boss
  yeh a few days ago
  where was you yesterday wanted to
see you
 oh i was around town over at
looeys mostly
  where was you last night
  it came like a whip-lash the mans
eyes shifted again and he seemed non-
plused he was not quick-witted he
stood there like an oaf sensing that some-
thing was wrong but not knowing just how
to reply
  you was at mesquite springs thun-
dered the boss
  carlton caught his breath the other
turned white he put up his hands as if
to fend off something his jaw drooped
and his eyes twitched
  the boss sprang forward like a tiger
  ive got you now he snarled thought
youd git away with it with me with
me huh
dolans mighty left arm grasped
the back of the mans neck the
right hand reached forward its
muscled fingers clutched the throat and
lifted the screeching man off the floor
flinging him backward pn to the counter
there was a thud and a squeal the mans
eyes were popping from their sockets and
his face was distorted inhumanly
  who told you to do it bellowed the
boss
  there was a gurgle from the wide mouth
that sounded like a stifled shriek dolan
ran a linger along the throat under the
jaw
  the man squirmed sicldshly and flailed
his long legs in every direction carlton
turned away wondering what to do
  who told you to kill snow roared the
boss quick youve only got a second
to live
  carlton couldnt stand it any longer
 dont he shouted man alive-
dontl
  he dared the ferocious wtath of the boss
and laid a hand on the muscled shoulder
trying to pull it away
  shut up roared dolan turning his
savage eyes on the engineer git out of
my way-quick and with one heave of
those powerful shoulders he shoved carlton
across the aisle
  then the boss looked dowti upon his
victim again this time his voice was
very soft and smooth
  tell me before i strangle you
  black gasped the suffering man
  the boss bared his white teeth in a
wollish smile
  jim black he snarled i thought
so what for what did he want quick
-answer
  money choked the other
  the boss ran his finger under the jaw
again the other screeched
  a letter a letter snow fought oh
leggo me
  was black there insisted the boss
  no it was lige hackett this re-
ferred to one of the worthless loafers hang-
ing around town
  carlton had recovered his balance but he
found himself trembling and perspiring as
the result of the fiendish scene he was wit-
nessing every nerve in his body was
tingling he knew the boss was his friend
he admired dolan for many things but
here the boss sickened him though the
man probably deserved this punishment
dolans wtatli was too inhuman and carl-
ton feared-knew-that before his eyes a
mans neck was about to be broken he
rushed forward with all his desperate
strength and tore at those cruel fingers
madly
  quit it-quit it he pleaded dolan
-come out of it its murder-murder
youll be as bad as he is
  the savage eyes of the boss glared at him
for an instant and carlton wondered if he
too were to be a victim thn the giant
passed an elbow in front of his eyes and
when they were cleared again they were
sane
  holy smoke came the voice of lange
behind carlton in awte at the miracle
  what the-what do you want me to
do roared the boss kiss him
  no but dont kill him youre a
deputy sheriff why not arrest him
  the idea seemed to be utterly novel and
the boss of mirage

the boss showed quizzical wrinkles about
his eyes
  i might he ruminated but how about
that county gang think i want them
cornin up here nix
  well why not take the prisoner down
there suggested the engineer
  the faces of the other men showed queer
smiles dolan also began to grin the
thought of himself descending from his
high rookery in the foot-hills to parade a
prisoner into the county-seat before the
astonished and nervous gaze of the enemy
politicians struck the bosss sense of humor
so that his grin became broad carlton
did not realize how deep was the line of
demarcation between the countys office-
holders and the lord of this foot-hill settle-
ment
  the engineer could not know of all the
tricks started by the politicians down below
with the purpose of getting dolan for
past disfavors neither did he ken of certain
crafty efforts to compel a willing but timor-
ous board of supervisors to cancel dolans
county liquor license carlton was blithely
stepping into the history of fifteen years of
red feud between dolan -with his axes to
grind and the politicians with their axes
to grind-but he did not know it dolan
did
  no said the boss better leave well
enough alone ill arrest this man and let
some one else take him into town he
turned to the prisoner hey you-
youre rested git that you make a
move and ill ram your heels into the back
of your throat the sight of the lout
seemed to make dolans temper rise again
what did black give you for the job
he roared suddenly
  the other shuffled his feet
  nawthin he muttered
  what nothin the boss reached
out his hand again quit that lyin or
ill strangle you again
  the other flinched
  no he cried anxious to appease and
now hasty with explanations black
didnt give me nothin it was finch a
long time ago finch grub-staked me
four times he gits his supplies from the
yampa mine-freighters so nobody knew
about it then he called the debt he
sez he didnt want my mine sez he
wanted persnal service later on he sez
fer me to join black when black wanted
me then black wanted me the man
gulped i didnt intend to do it but
black sez it was easy an then snow
started scrappin and-things happened
yeh said dolan bitterly i git you
im gettin a lot of things how long ago
did finch call the loan
  oh six months ago
  the boss seemed to ponder for some
time looking at the floor suddenly he
grabbed the man searched him swept him
into a little bare cubby-hole in the back of
the store locked the padlock stormed
through the door into the dance-hall took
a sawed-off shotgun from behind the bar
examined it and then strode outside
  it all happened so quickly that it left no
time for remarks from the others and dolan
seemed to invite none when it was over
the two men looked at carlton and grinned
  phew said the bow-legged lange
hes started now
  yeh agreed the other goin after
lige hackett the pal-or mebbe jim
black
  think wed better follow him sug-
gested carlton
  not on your life dont butt in the
man mopped his face with a bandanna
lets have a drink he offered
  the engineer felt he needed something
just then so they ambled up to the scarred
old mahogany bar
mike the bartender served them
offhandedly he was telling some
history to a few cattlemen and
could not stop his talk even when the boss
came for a shotgun mike was trained
not to interfere with the affairs of others
and thus he had lived happily and gained
fat for many years
   yessir said mike this here mahogany
bar was once the finest licker-chute in the
whole southwest bar none yessir shes
old and scarred and busted now but time
was when folks used to cross the hull state
jest to drink here that was after dan
dolan first got known in the countrv but
he earned it jessir he earned it why
the things that feller went through to git
that forty-foot piece of mahogany here
would drive a hull regiment plum starin
crazy yessir dan dolan nursed that bar
through three hundred an eighty miles of
the dog-gonedest country the devil ever
built yessirl
	adventure
  how why he jest pulled her here
by the roots lemme see-that was about
seventy-four or live i forgit wljich the
boss was jest a kid then-all vim an go an
muscle an ginger fightin all day an
dandn all night there was nothin to
this here town them days-only a few tents
an a few mewls an a few men an a few
burros when the boss come he seen there
was goin to be a lot of prospectors an
ranchers in these parts so he figgered on
gittin ready for trade first thing he
built was a saloon then he figgered on
a genral merchandise store but there wasnt
no stock hereabouts lor a store so he went
outside to git things
  in them days there wasnt no branch-
line railroad only the main line way
north there wasnt no road only a trail
well dan lit out with twelve mewls an a
big wagon after he got to the railroad-
three hundred an eighty miles in winter
gents-he made up his mind that as longs
hed started business hed start right so
along with the other things he orders a
gosh-wouopin bar from saint looey and
camps down an waits till she arrives
   bout three months later that bar
lopes in on a freight-car the boss had her
set up on the platform an when he seen
how shiny an line she was with a lot of
dewdabs an dingbats an fancy scroll-work
there was nothin on earth could make him
take her down again dye think dan
dolan was goin to drag jest a lot of boards
around no sir no style to that he
wanted to advertise her and he did it
got so that the hull darned country up there
wanted to keep the bar so he loaded her
on to the wagon quiet pertected the wood-
work with sacks tied her well down and
then pulled out fer home with ten feet of
that bar stickin out of the wagon
  the boss started from here with ten
men sort of an escort of honor he
started back with twelve-two volunteers
the men rode on lop of the bar and the wet
goods an merchandise was packed under-
neath maltin a neat little cargo well
this here parade went along line till up in
the juniper mountains some fool emptied
his pipe through the vents in the bar
underneath some licker had got loose so
after the fire was out most of the mer-
chandise was overboard and the bar was
considerable black in spots but still she
was there and that was all the boss wanted
  there was a bunch of injuns on the
war-path about that lime over in western
nevada they scattered into little war-
parties to raise as much-as possible
and one of these here parties run into dan
an the lar the boys lifted the tiling offn
the wagon an made a little fort out of it
till the injuns got de-pressed and lit out-
them that was left the rest is there
yet
  dans party was all shot up six men
was gone two more was down seven mewls
had drifted to heaven the bar was full of
holes an dan dolan was ragin mad
they say it took him two days to cool
down he wanted to chase them injuns
all over nevada for pluggin his bar
  finally the boss reorgnized himself an
they started off again with everything
overlxard but the bar seven men an a
fewr overloaded mewls the boss had his
jaw set then it looked like luck was trvin
to beat him so he swore to git that mahog-
any here if he had to drag it but except
for an axle or two breakin here an there
an gittin bogged down in the mountains
when the rain come everything went along
so-so till they came to mud creek
  a big cloudburst arrived that evenin
sent forty billion gallons of water down
mud creek all at once scooped out five
thousand acres of mud creek canon an
sent that bar ten miles down-stream
  dolan swore enough bad language to
supply the state for twenty years but still
he wouldnt let go of that bar three men
went down-stream an was never seen
again dolan an three others got the
animals to higher ground an watched the
wagon an bar breeze away at fifty miles per
hour an still the boss wouldnt give in
  when daylight come the waters was
down some an the xss found his wagon
way down-stream draped around a tree
that w as standin upside dow n the other
fellers pried the wagon loose but the boss
kept after that bar he found her nice
polished top grindin the face off a half-acre
granite boulder but still hed found her an
that was what he wanted then another
trouble came one of the comer-posts
had worked loose an was gone that
meant tacklin about twenty thousand
acres of swampy ground lookin for that
post but he found her gents it took
three days but he found her shes right
under my foot now gents-old style
the boss of mirage

mahogany and four foot wide-an that was
twenty-live years ago
  well in about a week he had that bar
up on the wagon and they started off again
there was only three of em then because
one had got too far into the swamp-waters
there was only four mewls there was
notiiin but rope for harness there was no
provisions no terbacker no hope-but they
still had that bar
  well after livin on the country-
mostly jack-rabbit-this here procession
got within a hundred miles of home the
boss was startin to feel better when up by
sandy mountain on the nevada line the
off hind wheel of the wagon curled up an
quit forever jest resigned unanimous
well the boss he sat on a rock an swore
so bad he twisted the tails on the mewls
but do you think that fellowd quit no
sir that bar was cornin into mirage if
he had to bite it into chunks an bring the
pieces in his teeth yessir
  they pried some boards under the axle
to make a sling but when they tried to
start them four mewls couldnt budge the
thing sand was up to the hubs anyhow
there the boss was stuck again so he
breezed out for some more animals there
was a peaceful injun camp a few miles
away where they had a lot of young hosses
the boss tried to dicker but they couldnt
savvy the lingo so he borried them colts
anyhow
when dan dolan got them
eight wild injun mustangs hitched
to them four mewls an that wagon
things begun to happen yessir first
thing dan knew that bar was makin sixty
miles per hour bumpin over rocks boulders
an crags with the hosses kickin an trvin
to go in every direction an dan trvin to
hold em down he fell off once an got
dragged he lost his last terbacker lost
his matches lost his watch lost his temper
lost his shirt an most of his pants but still
he hung on to that bar one feller got slid
off for good but they wasnt stoppin jest
then fer anything they jest ripped an
snorted an rattled an banged along them
trails like a drunken comet
  they got within fifty miles of here
when the outfit struck a chuck-hole dan
says that was the most gosh-wollopin
chuck-hole ever invented and she jest
happened to be in the wrong place she
was a big crack where the trail quits cornin
down-hill turns quick an starts up-hill
dans brakes was gone an them mustangs
swept dowm that hill like a stampede-each
animal with his ears back his eyes wild
an his tail stickin straight out humpin
along like greased lightnin with dan
pullin an sweatin like a wild man when
that outfit hit that chuck-hole-bang
kindlin-wood
  dan came to with a gash in his shoulder
a piece of rope in his hands an that bar
standin on end laughin at him then
the boss really got mad-so mad he couldnt
even swear but did he give up no sir
he was jest startin
  the mustangs was gone fer good
mebbe they was the daddies of that band
of wild hosses folks sometimes see up in the
smoke range country also the mewds
was gone theyd come home a-rampin
what did dan do you say why the boss
walked in here with no shirt an mostly no
pants rested one night an then collected
an outfit the next day for the grand entry
there wasnt many wagons here then
only one old cart an some spare wheels
so the boss took that cart took them
wiieels took eight mewls took three men
an started out to git that bar
  yessir youve guessed it he used
the cart fer the front put the spare wheels
right on to the bar an sailed her into
mirage one day like he was the king of
spain returning from a victory proud
haughty why all he needed was a
nigger to fan him sos hed look like cle-
opatry on that there barge like the picture
over there yessir half the towns folks
was gone most of the mewls wasdead the
bar looked like scrambled eggs and the boss
was all busted up an caved in-but dan
dolan got that bar into mirage yessir
she was rebuilt an shes right here in front
of you your pleasure gents
  but interrupted one of the men
how did dolan get the stock to go with
the bar
  how demanded the bartender scorn-
fully howr why he started right back
an done it all over again with the supplies
that s how he done it theres some people
can be made to quit gents but the boss
he belongs to another family yessir
yes-sir
  underneath it all carlton wondered at
the misguided tenacity and misdirected

adventure
heroism which would cause a sane man
to suffer so nobly for such an utterly worth-
less cause and yet still further under-
neath-was it worthless as the voluble
old bartender intimated the incident ad-
vertised dan dolan and his goods through-
out the southwest and laid the foundations
for a power which now seemed to hold this
district in the hollow of one mighty hand
  thus in its last analysis the thing was a
masterpiece of business acumen and yet-
the man who had shown such acuteness was
probably out now laying all his brains
aside bringing himself into the gutter with
the rest and giving vent to his dangerous
passions by committing murder with a shot-
gun carlton was not sure but he thought
he had heard a muffled report from some-
where outside during the bartenders nar-
rative
  the men drank in silence as if waiting
for something to happen the engineer
took a small drop for sociability then
turned and looked outside the door toward
the ramshackle street a shadow crossed
dolans board walk then heavy footsteps
sounded upon it the boss strode in
with the shotgun still in his hand looking
neither to right nor left he passed behind
the bar threw the gun open tossed out an
empty shell blew down the barrel threw
in a fresh cartridge and put the weapon
under the bar after which he wiped his
hands on his trousers
  well what happened asked carlton
  got him grunted dolan
  wtio they all chorused
  yagers pal lige hackett
  dead asked the engineer
  yeh he reached for a gun
  it was a calm easy statement carlton
couldnt admire that side of his friend it
gave him the chills also there were con-
sequences to consider though the old
free-and-easy customs were still in effect
here the laws of the state were gaining
ground daily and must be reckoned with
and then carlton remembered that dolan
was in bad with certain persons down
below at the county-seat and the boss
had taken the law into his own hands
  well surmised the engineer slowly
i suppose well have investigations and
things the folks down below will all be up
here
  they will not scorned the boss
  how do you make that out
  there was the old shrewd satisfied ex-
pression on dolans face that showed he
had not laid his brains aside after all
  confound it roared the boss didnt
you remind me i was a deputy sheriff
well then hackett died legal he died
resistin an officer
viii
it was a clincher the genial old
thug was so satisfied about his flaw-
less act of manslaughter that carlton
could only gasp he felt himself coming
under the spell which made the others
bestow upon the boss an awe that was tinged
with admiration or fear according to the
view-point in a way the engineer was be-
ginning to be nervous about dolan it was
like asking water to put out a fire and
receiving a cloudburst carlton began to
wonder how it was all going to end then
he started wondering how it began
  arc-are you sure you got the right
man he asked at length
  sure why didnt axel yager say
hackett helped to kill snow
  yes yes i heard that but how
did you know yager was the right man
didnt he confess
  yes but how did vou know before
that
  the boss leaned across the bar and spoke
very patiently
  didnt i tell you once i was a merchant
yeh you remember well bout twelve
years ago i got a lot of bandannas one
set had a fioor-dc-lee pattern i sold em
out years ago ceptin one jest one i
put her away among the old stock she
roosted there for years then two weeks
ago the yager brothers came in for a
bandanna i served em myself i was
out of the stuff right then so i dug around
found that one sold it to tom or axel
i forgit which she was the only floor-de-
lee in the whole county the pattern went
out years ago then snow got killed he
had hold of that rag it was tom or axel
killed him but i didnt know which tom
was slecpin off a long jag so it was axel
see i ts simple to guess things when youre
a merchant son
  carlton gave in the boss was too much
for him as a deputy sheriff dolan had
completed a comfortable killing as a mer-
chant he had tracked down a murderer and
the boss of mirage

as a saloon-keeper he had provided for the
shooting of ebenezer finch carlton won-
dered what other jobs or positions he
held
  did you meet up with any one else
asked the engineer meaning jim black
  no the face of the boss skewered
into perplexed wrinkles again come into
the store carlton i want to see you
  the curious engineer followed him back to
the environment of barter and sale and the
boss leaned against a pile of blue overalls
  blacks beat it what do you make of it
all asked dolan assured of privacy here
  i dont know admitted the engineer
it seems as if one tiling has led to another
i know it isnt all about my little valley
anyhow
  no thats a side issue finch got
you in then somethin came along bigger
than you then he wanted you out quick
he tried the old boss game but it wouldnt
work takes too much time anyhow
so he got black on your trail he wanted
to git you out quick why ill tell you
its because theres somethin big doin
in this county and hes got a finger in it
its crooked or hed be out of it blacks
in it too now what is it and wheres
black gone to
  maybe to the county-seat
  dolan nodded
  i think so probly lit out as soons he
seen my note to lawyer campbell after
snow died he must have watched me
talkin to snow i gave the letter to snow
and he seemed careless about it so i yelled
at him black must have thought it was
important mebbe he wanted to know
how much i knew thats how snow got
killed the boss pondered for a moment
funny thing-i didnt know that letter
was important myself
  what
  naw i jest took a guess i was
gropin in the dark do you know what
was in that note i jest asked campbell
to look over the county records wanted
to see how much land finch or black
owned in this country
  what got that idea into your head
because said the boss theres been
some funny doins in this county for the past
year and i didnt pay much terition to them
because i had my own troubles i was
asleep at the switch when you came into
the country you woke me up i pulled
you along because i wanted to see what
was doin then i begun to see there was
more goin on than i ever dreamed of i
got to rememberin backward to certain
happenins where men took up land around
here and then blew away dye begin to
see
  carlton saw the boss abandoned his
choppy language and talked straight and
the engineer was struck between the eyes
by the revelation
  theres been a big land-grabbing deal
here and finch is in it i see but whats
the purpose of it and what is there
crooked in that
  dolan answered the last question first
nothin-mebbe only there was a
couple of people owed finch money and
disappeared they was friends of mine
good friends they blew away sudden i
didnt know they owed finch money i
aint sure yet i only got rumors long after
they went but if the county records show
that finch has their property-
  the boss closed his fingers into a mighty
fist and looked down upon it
  savvy supposin there was other folks
like that all over the county how should
i know people come and go and sup-
posin there was a lot of prospectors tradin
at the yampa mine store finch owns
stock in the yampa i hear suppose them
prospectors had hard luck and ran up bills
they couldnt pay spose finch asked
for persnal service suppose there was a
lot of dummy homesteaders in these lands
around here what do you think of it
carlton did not know what to
think in fact it was hard to con-
ceive that the drooling old slouch of
lost deer valley could amount to so much
the tiling looked incongruous and yet
with finch in combination with the suave
jim black money- anl unscrupulousness
were hand in hand forming the age-old
alliance against which honest men have
battled for centuries
  why did black go to the county-seat
blurted carlton that is if he went
there
  i dont know mebbe thatll be for
you to find out
  me
  yes you when black seen what was
in that note to campbell he streaked out
that s what it looked like anyhow so

adventure
im goin to send that note to campbell
again by you savvy
  the engineer thought of his wife his
ranch and all the other elements which
claimed his attention
  but how can i leave here he argued
take your wife grunted dolan the
tripll do her good weathers cool now
take bob lange and phil johnson with
you take the prisner to the sheriff
ill deputize you it might be a good idea
for you to git acquainted down below
anvhow
 why
  oh i dunno said the boss vaguely
it may come in handy youre a per-
feshnul man helps business them two
hired men can tend to your ranch no
trouble possible now finch is sick in bed
carlton felt that he was being wafted
along in the tide of dolans will playing a
part in some larger drama than he suspecled
with the boss pulling the strings and yet
he went dolans logic was good and
carlton was impelled by curiosity to visit
the county-seat anyhow
  thus on the next morning with his khaki-
clad wife astride a big black horse carlton
started out at the head of his cavalcade
under the engineers khaki norfolk jacket
a short-barreled colt nestled in a holster
somewhere in a pocket of the girls skirt
was a little two-barreled derringer but the
other two travelers wore franker weapons
swinging over the hips of their overalls
only the silent prisoner was unarmed the
party was ready for anything
  but nothing happened no skulking
figures lurked in ambush in the long sunny
vistas of sage-brush and greasewood nor
in the rocks and washed-out canons of the
foot-hills nor in the miles of mesquite and
yucca-palms cool winds made the trip
easy and they ambled along as if on a
picnic taking thei time and putting up at
scattered ranch-houses at night even the
prisoner caused no trouble the others
were armed and had better horses and
during the rests they stood guard over him
  they arrived at the county-seat late in
the morning heading for the county jail
behind the ramshackle old court-house upon
whose top stood a flagpole and a decorative
wooden statue of the period of  once
chastely attractive but now grimy and
lacking a nose and two hands horses and
buggies went up and down the unpaved
main street others were alined along the
hitching-racks wagons arrived with goods
from near-by ranches winding pasta yampa
mine freight-team standing in front of a
blacksmith shop with the leaders of its
fourteen big mules jingling bells from their
collars at every movement
  cow-punchers rode about the street or
loafed among the seasons remaining flies
where the board sidewalk jutted into the
roadway the dingy old glass fronts of the
busy little stores advertised the wares in a
way but the main attractions were sacks of
oats and bales of hay lying by each open
door and displaying the latest market
quotations on signs done crudely in lamp-
black
  the whole town was a living contrast
it was dreamy and bustling civilized and
half-savage modem and bucolic as if the
new west and old west were being intro-
duced to each other here a prospector
toting many weapons and wearing the long
hair of a buffalo bill led his two burros
up to a store and mopped his broad-
brimmed sombrero
  a man in gray business clothes and a
derby hat went past him into the same store
a cow-puncher in white angora chaps
displaying guns and cartridge-belt doffed
his hat to a schoolmaam in white while a
yelping dog-fight around the corner brought
forth denizens from four saloons including
two brisk eastern commercial travelers
and three indians wearing giddy red
blankets
  to carlton and the girl it seemed like a
return to the outside world they did not
realize what hermits they had been in their
little vallev here the roadway had trees-
actual umbrella and locust trees while up
above there wasnt a tree for miles except
in carltons own valley here there wras a
garden or two with little white-painted
houses nestling among them the sight
made them realize the community feeling
thev had lacked
  the party registered at the old-fashioned
wooden hotel set within wide verandas
and then carlton and bob lange brought
the prisoner to the county jail where the
lean-faced mustached sheriff recovered
from his surprize put the prisoner behind
bars and shot a string of questions at
carlton
  the engineer told him a straightforward
story about the prisoners confession but
the boss of mirage

neglected to speak of the other angles
acting on advice from dolan  he sheriff
finally scratched his head
  but why did the feller kill snow he
asked what was the motive
  maybe it was robbery
  huh all a freighter has is a whip an
a chaw of terbacker fat chance i guess
dolans fell down gotta have better
motives than that to work on
  the engineer moved a bit so the light
from the window would fall squarely on
the sheriffs face he was about to spring
something and he wanted to observe every
move of the mans expression
  snows murder was ordered by jim
black he announced very quietly
  hey
  the sheriffs face underwent a trans-
formation for only a fraction of an instant
but in that time carlfbn learned what he
sought there was some connection be-
tween this member of the county gang
and the mysterious gunman of mirage
  thems strong words young man
snapped the sheriff it might be hard to
prove course i dont know this black
very well but still hes a citizen and such
remarks might land you in a peck o
trouble
  carlton shrugged his shoulders
  i didnt charge it he retorted the
prisoner confessed it himself
  who to
  dan dolan
  yeh but how many witnesses
  three
  humph the sheriff seemed to cogi-
tate for some time looking at the floor
i guess well have to vestigate this
youre stayin at the hotel all right
youll be on hand if we want you see
you later
  and with this easy dismissal the sheriff
went through the door into the cells and
carlton and his companion feeling as if
something were wrong somewhere walked
out of the place thoughtfully
facing the court-house was a
little one-story red-painted office
and a sign over the door bore the
legend william j campbell attorney
at law carlton headed for this place
alone but found it locked he learned
that campbell would return later so the
engineer went back toward the hotel
which was off the main street he turned
a comer he passed a cottage and then
a big hav-barn suddenly a man came
around the barn and almost bumped into
him it was jim black
  they halted in surprize the two men
appraised each other for a second then
black decided to speak
  howdy he said what brings you
here
  why im just looking around the
country
  huh how far have you looked
  far enough
  the gray calculating eyes of the killer
seemed to flash but there was no overt act
black merely changed the subject a little
  heard you brought in a prisoner he
commented
  thats correct
  who was it
  axel yager
  though carlton watched black closely
the man did not seem as surprized as he
should be he merely nodded his head
dolan sent you he asked
  yes
  i see dolan sent you in well are
you aimin to mix into local politics any
the question brought the engineers quick
temper boiling to the surface carlton
took it for a sneer and resented it he was
sick of this jim black person anyhow he
had lived under a mental strain because of
the jim black myth that seemed to hold a
whole population in awe and now he had a
fascination to reach into that myth and see
what it was made of
  whats it to you he flared ill do
as i-please
  the outburst had an opposite effect to
the one expected black put his hands in
his pockets and seemed to cogitate with-
out carlton knowing it the other was con-
sidering whether to discommode his impor-
tant affairs just then and entangle with this
pesky engineer with possible embarrass-
ments up-country or wait till all his present
absorbing business affairs were disposed of
  its nothing to me he replied mildly at
length i was just wonderin i thought
itd be better for all hands if you didnt
  i will be the judge of that
  sure sure go to it right to the end
of the road go to it just so and
waving an ironic hand he turned and
walked away leaving the bewildered

adventure
engineer standing there and wondering
whether jim black were overestimated or
underestimated
  campbell was in when carlton appeared
at his office later and with the attorney was
a florid-faced well-dressed bald-headed
man with shrewd eyes introduced as lu-
cius van dorn representing interests look-
ing into the mines hereabouts
  id like you to take him into your coun-
try when you go back said campbell
he wants to look at the yampa mine and
the other properties around there
  the tall pleasant-faced attorney had
read dolans terse note and also an enclo-
sure concerning ihe engineer when the
reading w-as over he seemed very thought-
ful
  tell me all about it he invited
carlton looked at van dorn but the lat-
ter seemed thoroughly comfortable in his
chair campbell caught the glance
  go ahead he said van dorns a-
friend of mine he wants to know the gen-
eral situation up-country anyhow i told
him it wfas a tough neighborhood maybe
youll make him believe it
  still a bit wary because of the third per-
son but accepting campbells judgment
carlton sat down and gave a detailed ac-
count of much that had happened since
first he went into his little valley at the
end of it campbell whistled
  phew thats a pretty mess i can
hardly make head or tail of it i won-
der-i wonder if dolans intercepted note
has anything to do with certain powwows
the court-house bunch held last night with
some strangers they kept the lights burn-
ing all night theres something big in the
wind but-hello whos there
  a knock rapped on the door but before the
attorney could open it the sheriff turned the
knob and walked in followed by a chubby
deputy the sheriff wasted no time on
formalities
  hey he bawled to carlton what
sort of goins-on are you havin up in your
country anyhow what are you doin
puttin up a game on me
  game challenged carlton rising from
his chair what are you talking about
what game the sheriff grinned
shrewdly why bringin down a prisner
that confessed to murder because he was
bein choked to death tell me did dan
dolan strangle this man or not
  dolan tried to get the truth out of
him snapped carlton
  yell sarcastically truth why
if i was choked like that id of confessed to
killin president lincoln so would you
truth gosh and then dolan has the
cold crust to send this man down here as
prisner on a charge of murder after dolan
himself killed that hackett feller with a
shotgun say the sheriff was getting
excited what-what sort of a slam-bang
place have you fellers got up there anyhow
aint there no law or order there at all is
the whole district jest one floatin insane
asylum howd you happen to come into
this howd you come into cahoots with
dolan
  im not in cahoots with any one rasped
carlton dolans a friend of mine un-
derstand he asked me to take a prisoner
down here and iv done it if you have
anything to say to dolan go up there and
say it yourself
  say it roared the sheriff it woiddnt
do no good that fellers got a brain like
marble the only thing hell listen to is a
grand jury indictment
  what for demanded the attorney
for everything it might be for mur-
der an conspircy to railroad this feller
axel yager to the pententiary weve
had enough of dolan in this country
well go up and tell him so invited
carlton
  the sheriff waved it away angrily
  as for you young feller he snapped
youd better neglect to say much about
jim black promptin any one to kill snow
theres nothin in it nothin see i
i jest seen jim black
  i knew you would nodded carlton
the sheriff did not know which way to
take the remark so he let it go campbell
broke in upon him
  then youre going to let yager go he
asked
  going to no i done it already
on his own recognizance i suppose
sure the district attorney advised it
what is there to hold him on
  carltons brain was working fast he
remembered how placid the prisoner had
been during his march into the countv-seat
and wondered if the man believed he was to
come among friends considering that a
murder charge was hanging over his head
the mans docility had been remarkable
the boss of mirage
i
  then my trip was all for nothing he
murmured
  sure what else could it be the
whole things wrong everythings wrong
with dolan in it you tell that feller i
want to see him if he dont come down in
a few days well go up after him well
straighten out that buzzard-roost or well
know why
  attorney campbell pointed a mandatory
finger
  sheriff he said you may do as you
see fit i see no reason to interfere with
your duty-or with your personal grudges
i only want to warn you that if the prison-
er is guilty you have laid yourself open to
serious charges as an official of this county
ill take the advice of the district
attorney on that i aint goin to you for
advice thats certain
  no said the attorney and its too
bad well good day
  hey
  i said good day
  the sheriff thought it over for a moment
then took the hint silence ensued van
dorn who had not stirred a muscle before
began mopping his fat face and bare fore-
head
  by george he exclaimed this is
the most interesting country i ever got into
do you stage these rows every day
  every other day smiled campbell
its just routine business now some
day - and his face lighted a bit-well
have a new deal in this county and then
shell begin to be worth while
  whats the big trouble asked van
dorn
  stick-in-the-mud ideas new-fangled
tilings-like better roads or power lines or
sewer systems-bring in new folks new
manners of running things and possibly
higher taxes these are the main troubles
except for crookedness and thats hard to
prove if i went into these courts with
anything but iron-clad riveted absolutely
proven cases id be laughed out of court
so im stuck the whole countys con-
trolled-even down to the janitor in the
court-house
  the illuminating talk struck cariton
amidships carlton was one of those new-
fangled arrivals with new-fangled ideas
it was a minor point but it was just an-
other mite of eidence pointing toward a
connection between the county politicians
and the slouchv old miser of lost deer
valley
  you folks stay here finished camp-
bell reaching for his hat im going over
to the court-house to look at those records
for dolan he must be playing some
hunch make yourselves at home and
he vanished through the door
  with campbell well on his errand van
dorn started asking shrewd questions about
dolans country keeping up the conversa-
tion while carlton kept his eye on the big
old clock ticking on the dingy wall over a
rack of california reports and other law
books banked up from the desk an hour
passed then campbell strode through
the doonvav laid his hat carefully over his
ink-well and turned to the other two
  dolan will not get his information he
announced part of the county records
have been accidentally mislaid 
lx
back again in the valley with
finch lying in a far-off hospital
with the knowledge that dolans
weighty backing was always ready and
with his own strength coming up gloriously
so that he little resembled the failing man
who had arrived months before carlton
again took up the work of completing his
little ranch under the copper mountain just
as if the water were tumbling down lost
deer creek already
  in the upper valley across the old
picket-fence which marked liis meadows
from finchs the engineer could see horses
and mules placidly- grazing attended only
by finchs half-witted employee and by a
few others who came at times to help out
to all outward signs the valley was the
abode of peace and pastoral beauty
autumn leaves were beginning to fail off
the oak trees wild geese from some un-
known habitat flew southward to their
winter homes scudding clouds appeared in
the once-burning skies and cool winds
soughed through pines oaks willows and
the long dry grass of the meadowrs inside
the house the young wife kept a stove going
almost steadily feeding it from piles of
cord-wood stacked up in a newly-built
woodshed
  carlton worked from mom to night re-
pairing fences fixing old roofs improving
the fields and putting odd hours into that

adventure
system of irrigating ditches on which he had
set his mind with a transit he first ran
levels along the inner rim of the hills using
one of his helpers as a rodman and placing
stakes so as to form a gentle grade for the
ditch then he started work digging into
the ground blasting away rocks and pine-
stumps and building gates and laterals to
connect the little toy ditches of the future
with the main irrigation system he found
his muscles growing stronger daily and his
mind becoming keener he enjoyed every
minute of it
  sometimes carlton went outside and sur-
veyed boundaries for others suaightening
out disputes concerning property lines
which were often in helter-skelter condition
in this way he became well acquainted
throughout the district meeting all sorts of
men some of them belonging to the pic-
turesque days of bret harte and others
hailing recently from michigan ormissouri
or iowa they were the fruits of the work
of the western railroads in offering colo-
nist rates and attracting the great popula-
tion of settlers which was even then be-
ginning to make the new west some of
them went to the cities some to the rich
farm-lands and some of the more adven-
turous willing to take a chance drifted
into the desert
  but carlton gained the greatest collec-
tion of new acquaintances through his short
visit to the county-seat after the episode
when campbell learned that the county
records had been secreted the lawyer had
taken the engineer about and introduced
him to acquaintances who had happened in
from all corners of the county some of
these met carltons wife also they were
mine-owners from the black rock country
to the east ranchers from the southern flat-
lands about escalante creek and willow
creek hay and grain traders from the
alfalfa tracts surrounding the county-seat
and prospectors from all the hills and
valleys
  campbell had not t ried to regain the lost
records he explained that he did not wish
to seem too eager so he put in the rest of
the time going around with carlton the
meeting of van dorn and lhe guiding of
that stout personage and two of the latters
eastern friends to mirage were mere inci-
dents he had left them with dolan
  a month went by without happenings in
the valley and apparently with none out-
side even the sheriff had not made good
his threat to clean dolan out carltons
little place was changing a cow a big
collie dog two kittens five ducks and two
ddzen chickens added life to the place and
made it more homelike he had brought
them in from down below and in his
heart he felt they constituted a sort of chal-
lenge they made for a permanent resi-
dence as if jim black and ebenezer finch
never existed
  and then finch came back
  he rode by on a sorrel mare just at night-
fall one day trailing two pack-mules laden
with supplies and bringing a nondescript
hired man in faded overalls who paid no at-
tention to the carlton domicile but plugged
right along for the upper ranch finch
however seemed to take an interest in the
carlton improvements noting the new
woodshed chicken-coops and cow-bam with
appreciative eyes that peeped out from un-
der an antiseptic bandage he even nodded
to carlton but the latter kept about his
business
  the engineer sensed that there would be
further complications when finch arrived
and there were a week later finch
strolled across lhe meadow and approached
the little green picket-fence of the garden
waving a white handkerchief somewhat
ironically carlton was washing his face
behind the kitchen and strolled forth with a
towel in his hand
  well what do you want he de-
manded across the fence
  why-i sorter felt id like to have a little
neighborly talk with ye answered finch
with the old persuading wheedling whining
voice i thought mebbe as haow we might
be able to patch up them little troubles sos
wed be right friendly again there haint
been a hoss or a mewl pizened since i went
away and  calclateyou been right neigh-
borly abaout it i thought mebbe youd
changed your mind so i sez to myself sez i
let bygones be bygones so i come over
here to make things friendly again
  thats kind of you nodded carlton
didnt i say once id probably shoot you
on sight
     finch waggled the white rag
isis hastily
         you was all excited an ruffled
up he deprecated a pussons lible to
say anything when hes that way but
the boss of mirage

sez i a soft answer turneth away wrath
so im a-trvin to make things neighborly
again now abaout them hosses finch
waved them away it wasnt the loss
it was only the principle of the thing it
dont look friendly to pizen hosses you
kin see that yourself but now we kin forgit
them tilings-that is if you want to stay
here mebbe you dont want to
  finchs eyes showed a crafty look
  let me hear your offer demanded
carlton tersely
  well-you been right decent abaout
that stock while i was away in the hors-
pittle so i calclate i kin skeer up mebbe
six thousan or so-
  i paid eight thousand reminded carl-
ton
  well you couldnt expect me to give
that much considerin me bein sick with
eary-sipilis with all sorts of doctor bills and
a danged white nurse that cost me twenty-
five dollars a week taint fair im a
sick man you wouldnt take advantage
of me bein sick would you
  the wheedling self-pitying whine made
carlton want to hit the man
  your price is too low he snapped
well--taint exacly the right thing to
take advantage of a sick man that haint
hisself yit it seems like things is cornin
sorter hard fer me-sorter hard-but live
an let live is my mottow so mebbe i kin
skeer up eight thousan mebbe i kin
bony an put myself into debt
  he stopped and sighed but received no
satisfaction
  i might be able to git even nine thou-
san he glanced sideways but got no
response or mebbe ten thousan i
dunno i reckon a man gits old an fool-
ish that land aint wuth ten thousan
but youre a young feller an mebbe its
better fer you to have the money than a
poor ol man with jest a few years to live
he sighed lugubriously its takin ad-
vantage of a poor sick ol man but-
  carlton leaned over the fence
  do you know how much ill take he
shouted
  lemme hear it
  one million dollars
  finchs jaw sagged
  why-why-thats plum foolish he
gasped its-its-
  certainly the whole talk is foolish
you couldnt get this ranch for all the

money youve got now you get across
that field and stay there move
  finchs jaw quit sagging and clamped to-
gether
  that haint the way to talk he pro-
tested
  git snapped carlton pointing toward
the upper ranch
  the mandate seemed to touch some hid-
den spring that threw away a mask
 who me the old miser trembled
for a moment hey hey youll talk
outa the other side of yer maouth pretty
soon dang you ive hed abaout enough
of ye you hoss-pizenin sneakin spyin
city-bred mongrel-ive stood fer yer non-
sense abaout long enough you git aout
of this valley in ten days-the hull pack an
passel of ye-or ill give ye a taste of some-
thin youll never git over ill show you
huh-ill show you
  the engineer at first startled by the
transformation looked one moment into
the hectic face of finch and then quietly
started along the fence toward the front
gate he reached the gate before finch was
half finished and he reached finch just as
the latter came to the end finch backed
away with his feet but his mouth held its
ground manfully
  dont you start nothin he warned
you hit me an ill make things so hot
youll wish youd never saw the place
hey-
  carlton lashed out it was his only
comment an instant later he regretted it
he had not properly gaged the growth of
his arm and shoulder muscles and the crush-
ing blow knocked finch half-wa v across the
lane it crashed into that snarling leering
face just below the eye and when the en-
gineer lifted the dizzy man up he saw a
bluish welt on that countenance as big as an
egg-
  carlton had struck a man just out of
the hospital his temper disappeared in a
flood of blame for himself he lifted the
man almost tenderly and stood him on his
feet
  im sorry he said contritely before he
saw how foolish the remark sounded
sorry youre sick that is he amended
if you were well now id take pleasure
in knocking your head off
  the victim gave him one look and in that
glance the engineer saw a cold malevolence
as dangerous as the fangs of a snake but

adventure
finch did not say anything he didnt
even brush himself he simply turned away
and walked straight across the held to his
own lands with the engineer watching until
he had passed the last oak tree up the
slope then carlton finished washing his
face very thoughtfully
  the wife had noticed the incident from a
window and so had one of the helpers but
by the time they arrived it was over later
on the engineer became nervous the old
strain was returning some one always
kept awake of nights now guarding the
place and yet nothing happened
  dan dolan arrived suddenly at the end of
a week riding a buckskin horse that looked
piteous under the great load the boss
came alone and unheralded wearing an un-
accustomed khaki outfit a broad-brimmed
hat and a pair of shining new boots just off
his counters
  thought id put up for the night he
announced may stay two nights on
my way to red rock back in the moun-
tains movin on the quiet meet a friend
there thursday mebbe dont say i was
here
  carlton welcomed him and the wife
though somewhat reserved prepared to
make him comfortable thus while she
busied herself in the little kitchen for the
evening meal the boss spread his great
bulk in a creaking chair before the open
fireplace while the engineer told him of the
latest incidents
  i knew all about it was dolans com-
ment im watchin things here finch
seems desprate to git you out of the way
  well do you think hell carry out his
threats
  nope hes too busy now got too
many irons in the fire if he hurt you hed
have too much extry trouble hes only
trvin to skeer you mebbe thats all he
can think of jest now
  well he wont scare me but ill admit
this thing keeps me nervous
  itll be over pretty soon grunted the
boss
  what makes you think so
  dolan gave the engineer one of his know-
ing glances
  son he observed if anything hap-
pened to you itll tear the county to pieces
with one big fight for a year or more this
countys been wakin-wakin like a man
from sleep theres a crowd here thats
choked things for years a combination
its like a net-one strand tied to another
i was a strand once i got into a row with
the rest and backed out id begun to see
where i was headin but the other strands
held strong together they tied up with
still other strands only it was all under-
ground couldnt be traced
  then you came in you made me look
at finch more careful the more i looked
the more i seen finch seemed like one
of the strands biraeby he begun to ap-
pear like a main cable then i dug around
some more there was men that hated
finch for many reasons there was men
that backed finch for many reasons
savvy they begun to take sides the
lines are drawin tight then theres men
thats workin for the county gang and
theres them thats agin em the whole
countys organized-both ways-and youre
the spark thatll mebbe set off the sky-
rockets
  me gasped carlton
  you or finch if any tiling happens to
either one theres goin to be a crash the
whole countys lined up if youd paid
much tendon to politics youd a seen it
the wife was taking a dish of steaming
soup to the table but she halted petrified
with the lamplight setting off the astonish-
ment on her pretty face
  great scott exclaimed carlton so
im a casus belli
  i dunno what that is said the boss
dubiously but theres goin to be hap-
pening around here-darned soon
carlton was thunderstruck at
the importance thrust upon him
he began to see why he had gone
to the county-seat and why campbell had
introduced him around to thoughtful men
from every section of the county there
was war on from thunder mountain to
south end and he was one of the chief
factors
  and yet the boss seemed to be comfort-
able about it-very he appeared to have
the satisfied exalted expression of the cat
that had swallowed the cream it made
the engineer wonder whose funeral was com-
ing next the boss was like some volcano
which to eliminate an irritating ant-hill
might blast away a whole province
  you set your mind easy maam said
dolan to the w-ife there wont nothin
 
the boss of mirage

happen to you folks if she happens shell
be the other way
  i dont want anything to happen she
responded folks ought to live in peace
peace came dolans deep voice like
the lowing of a bull yes maam were
goin to have peace in this county if we have
to turn her inside out and im goin to
work for it
  the boss walked over to the waiting
dinner-table with the rest and made himself
comfortable tucking his napkin into the
collar of his soft shirt and making the nearest
knife ready for business by wiping it care-
fully on the napkin-an impolite action
caused by years of eating in a certain chi-
nese restaurant
  im gittin a little old maam he con-
tinued im gittin tired of fights and ruc-
tions theres a new time cornin in this
land maam please pass the butter
you mean that things are going to be
entirely different she asked the-
saloons and gambling places and dance-
halls are all going to close
  no maam therell still be some devil
in human nature only therell be less
saloons and dance-halls and more schools
mebbe after my time theyll all close
mebbe id be glad of it if  could close my
dance-hall now id do it maam but it
wouldnt be right
  why not why not close it-or sell
it
  suppose i did spose some other sin-
ner took my place ran the joint took
charge of the girls are you sure hed treat
everybody like i do-feed em look after
em when theyre sick are you sure id be
doin right
  but-its barbarous she exclaimed
sure the whole systems wrong i
know it now im older than i was maam
but dont you think its better now for me to
run the joint if there must be crime and
riot up here aint it better to have some one
around that can reglate it
  carlton changed the subject hastily
the view-points of the tough old western
saloon-keeper and the cultured girl whose
mother was president of a philadelphia
branch of the womens christian temper-
ance union were a trifle too divergent
thereafter they talked on various topics
until late and peace reigned
  as the hours wore on carlton began to
notice his wife thawing perceptibly toward
the boss though he was crude and coarse-
grained lacking in morals except by his own
blunt code there was a magnetism and an
inner strength which reached beyond the
lines of culture or prejudice and gripped like
a vise those upon whom he bestowed his
friendship here before the firelight where
pine-logs blazed the boss of the roughest
section of the west seemed a different man
it was about the first home atmosphere he
was ever in and though he never quite over-
came his awkwardness his soul seemed to
warm in the glow of the hearth-flames
  he spoke of indian-fights of bygone days
of great gold-strikes great feuds and queer
characters until the whole colorful tragic
romantic southwestof the old days seemed
to appe- before them as on a screen he
spoke with the bland innocence of a child
seeing things with the clear prejudices of a
childs lucid but elemental mind one
man was good another bad a wells water
was good or bad a community was good
or bad there was no neutral between
them
  pie had picked a child out of a blizzard
and given it his scanty provisions until it
died despite his savage desire for its life
one man he saved from a mob anothers
life he blew out as one would snuff a candle
he spoke of the one as blandly as the other
and during his whole recital there was hon-
esty honesty honesty until the walls
seemed to ring under the spell of his down-
right soul
  well what do you think of him asked
carlton of his wife later when the stars
were shining coldly into their little dark up-
stairs room
  i pity him she responded i never
saw such a fine man gone to waste i pity
him with all my heart
  well dont tell him that he advised
sleepily and then he forgot all about it
  carlton awroke with a start and peered
about the dark room
  whiat was that he wdiispered but the
ticking of the little alarm-clock was the
only response 
  he strained to hear better a cricket
chirped somewhere outside and a watcher
in the dining-room rustled a newspaper
the engineer feeling foolish slid back into
dreamland
  five minutes later he awoke again
clutching at the coverlets far away faint
to his ears came a vague but persistent

adventure
drumming drumming drumming that could
mean but one thing
  horses he gasped theyre going
through the pass hear it he shook
his wife out of her slumbers hear that
she came to consciousness slowly
  i hear something she said at last
ft sounds like animals running she
stayed quiet for a time theyre com-
ing not going
  carlton sprang out of bed
  maybe finch is up to something he
surmised
theyre coming she reiterated wait
i heard a metallic sound theyre going
past the lane i wonder what time it is
carlton lit a match and peered into the
clock
  three in the morning he announced
he went to ihe window and looked out
seeing nothing but the cold stars and the
old copper mountain whose black silhouette
loomed high above and still the eery
drumming continued carlton at length
thought lie could almost hear the creak
of saddle-leather he grasped his trousers
and boots and pulled them on he picked
up his winchester and got ready to start
down-stairs but while he was organizing
the noise of the spectral cavalcade grew
fainter and fainter until only the sound of
the cricket could be heard seeming to
chuckle over the mystery
  it seems to be over announced the
wife they didnt stop here they went
up the valley better get back to bed i
guess it wont affect us
  im not so sure responded carlton
theres something fishy here it sounded
like a troop of cavalry-and dolans in
this house i wonder if theyre after him
great scott it may be the sheriff with a
posse putting up at finchs for the night
carlton grabbed all his clothes off a chair
and began to move as if he were through
with sleeping
  what are you going to do she asked
at length
  why im going to look into this tiling
theres some monkey-business going on
and-
sft the muffled crack of a shot came
to his ears from far across the upper
ej fields he ran to the window but-
toning his shirt there was a quick flash
from the brush near finchs house-then
another then another the far-away
reports began to roll like musketry there
was a faint stifled yell-then a fusillade
that sounded like tire-crackers
  a pin-point of steady flame arose from a
dark blotch that stood where a finch barn
ought to be it grew  bit then a lurid
yellow glare sprang up from the place as if
all the hay had caught lire at once horses
started stampeding in the distant fields
thundering their hoofs as they milled around
inside their fences the glare swung high
illuminating the sides of the tumble-down
houses and barns
  carlton jumped down-stairs two steps
at a time holding the winchester he
rushed upon the tenant less dining-room
where the hearth-embers were still glow-
ing and a ugh ted lamp stood upon the red
table-cloth he looked out of the door
one of the hired men was standing outside
the threshold smoking a corn-cob ami
looking across the field
  hello lie ejaculated you up
looks as if theres trouble over there
  wheres dolan demanded the engi-
neer
 him oh mebbe hes asleep he
sleeps sound dolan does no use to go
after him let him sleep
  carlton grunted assent and walked for-
ward swinging open his yard gate and
making for the oak groves on the upper
part of liis ranch he was filled with
curiosity it was a riot nothing less a
riot in his valley what did it mean
  he walked past the dark willows of the
creek and neared his boundary where the
half-built irrigation ditch lay the shots
wrere keeping up some singly and some in
gusts and as he went nearer he could see
the silhouettes of men dodging about in
the light of the crackling fire
  he came to the ditch and nearly fell in
he started walking along it cautiously a
horse whickered from an oak grove to the
left he turned and approached it and
finally discerned the dark forms of horses
massed under a tree he put out his hand
and patted a soft muzzle noting the bridle
  a cry came to his ears he sensed that a
form was staggering across the ditch and
approaching the horses he held his rifle
read- and walked toward the man warily
the mans breath seemed to be sucking in
like a broken-down pump but even in his
pain he noticed the engineer
the boss of mirage

  hey he yelled keep away who
are vou
  im carlton i own this place
  so did i snarled the other with an
unearthly note of triumph in his voice
but im even now i got him dang
his hide to tophet i got him-at last-
oh he started gurgling
  carlton bent over him quickly and struck
a match
  tom fulton he gasped youre
shot man-your shirts all red
  yeh snarled fulton he got me
he sat up in bed an shot till he keeled over
but we got him oh and lie put his
hand to his chest
  carlton knew whom fulton had shot
in his mind he visualized the murderous
pistol-battle in finchs old shanty with a
pack of vengeful demons spurting hot lead
through the dark doorway and the miser
dying as he had lived-alone in a corner
  but carlton heeded his duty to a helpless
man the poor monomaniac who could
not forget an injury lay on lhe ground
gasping with pain the engineer picked
him up gently and tried to lead him to
a horse but the man collapsed carlton
dragged him a little way but soon noted
that others were coming across the dark
fields the firing had ceased the sides
of the old bam were tumbling down and
the flames were reducing it all seemed to
be over
  another vague human form came toward
the horses then some more carlton called
for assistance and explained who he was
to make sure of them mysterious hands
grasped fulton and put him over a horse
other ghostly hands lashed him into place
vague bashful voices bade the engineer
take fulton to his home promising to
summon medical aid immediately then
the dark forms sprang to horses and gal-
loped away-presumably to hasten the
medical aid
  leading the horse and stumbling forward
carlton came to his house and yelled toward
the closed door every window was il-
luminated but he did not notice that
the door swung open and his wife and the
two helpers appeared and then he saw
dolan
  the boss was seated at the table fully
dressed with account-books and papers
and rough filing-cabinets piled hih in
front of him on the red table-cloth papers
were everywhere-yellow white blue and
green-littering the whole table and even
the floor the boss seemed engrossed in
them to the exclusion of everything else
   carlton and the others took fulton to a
room after which the engineer rushed to
join dolan then he stood irresolute
the boss looked as if he had struck the
treasure of the ages
  gosh he mumbled
   then he struck another find and his eyes
opened still wider
   what is it interrupted carlton
 the boss looked up like some old lion
holding venison in his paw and loath to be
disturbed
  its the evidence he snapped he
checked himself and explained the evi-
dence savvy somebody took it from the
finch place and left it here accidental
   a coincidence of course said carlton
with gentle irony
  sure coincidence but its jest
enough coincidence to bust open this
county from end to end its changed the
whole deal you thought you was in a
fight for your ranch i thought i was in a
county political fight son do you know
where the trail leads to
  where
   into the genral offices of a big railroad
into the department of the interior and
mebbe into the halls of the united states
congress
x
what shouted the engineer
   the boss lit a black cigar having
the dimensions and about the smell
of a sewer-pipe
  abso-lutely he responded theres
enough dynamite in them papers to rock
the state
   carlton sank into a chair while his wife
joined him from the sick-room
   whats the general idea of it all he
demanded whats happened begin at
the beginning
   well lets see near as i can make out
theres a plan up in congress to build a big
dam across thunder mountain creek for
irrigation there was a lot of talk about
it some time ago but it all died down id
clean forgot about it then this year
while congress wjas fiddlin over bills some-
body started the thunder mountain thing
again then a lectric compny seen a
adventure
chance for a power project and the railroad
wanted to build a supply-line also
wanted to tap the country when the land
was irrigated and the settlers came in
savvy everything seemed to come at
once-the gosh-dangdest projosition the
county ever seen
  the bosss eyes grew mystic and he blew
a dozen smoke-rings shed irrigate the
land from thunder mountain clear down to
escalante shed bring in a new deal all
around new settlers homes fruit-
ranches power lines roads schools
why in five years real-estate hered be
sellin in chicago and new york like they
do in los angeles hut all this was on
the quiet congress hadnt done nothin
yet and neither had the railroad or the
power company they was only considerin
it and they didnt want it to git out sos
to start land-speculation
  and then somebody leaked i git this
from finchs papers but some things is
mixed up it may be congressman rail-
road man or map-maker  dunno i only
know that right away some influence
started buy-in up all the land in sight on
the quiet buy-in beggin or stealin i
knew there was somethin goin on but i
couldnt lay my finger on it bimeby i seen
that the county gang was in it later on
i begun to see finch and black in it
finch seemed to be the main purchasin-
agent for the crowd
  mebbe they figgered nobodyd suspcct
him only he couldnt play square him
and black they slugged people with
guns mortgages or grocery bills bimeby
they had all sorts of land around the
foot-hills here meantime they held up
their own crowd they bought cheap and
padded the expcnse-accounts that was
finch all through he jest grabbed could-
nt play square even on a crooked deal
just wasnt built that way savvy
  yes i understand but lets get this
straight how much actual crime is un-
covered
  huh-look here suppose some con-
gressman was makin money out of it
s pose they was aimin to fix high prices
for rights of way for the govment or the
railroad or power compny spoe there
was others mixed up in finchs or blacks
killins spose finch didnt have to pay
taxes on them lands he held spose the
records in the recorders office was mislaid
sos the county gang wouldnt have to
pay for taxes either spose it was proved
that dummy homesteaders was workin
everywhere s pose the whole county was
jest loot loot loot iye see where the
trail leads crime why theres enough
crime to keep the jails busy for twenty
years
  phew whistled carlton and what
are you going to do with all this evidence
  give it to van dorn hes a govment
man he was ordered out here to snoop
around and look into things him and me
had a long powwow he seen all that i
seen but we couldnt get no further even
the county records was closed to us we
milled around like stray burros me waichin
the trails here and him diggin up things
outside finally van dorn says the only
way to git anything was to git into finchs
house and look over his papers but there
wasnt no way to do that except by breakin
the law
  dolans bland explanation made the
engineer smile
  i see he nodded and then just
by luck a lot of crazy hoodlums raided
finchs place and took out the papers by
accident
  jest so nodded the boss coin-
cidence tom fulton got over his bullet
and worked up his revengeful sperrits
then there w as others got het up till finally
they all got so darned mad they jest couldnt
stand it any longer savvy
  yes i savvy admitted carlton i
savvy it all quite a wonderful coincidence
and then your being here tonight-a
miracle
  sure it was i jest stopped here on my
way beyond to see a man now ive
changed myr mind but if questions is ever
asked i can show- him for a witness
savvy
  yes i understand said carlton gently
and then he sighed
  through whisky chicanery arson riot
and manslaughter his salvation had come
and though lie knew that the valley of his
home was saved to him for keeps he won-
dered now if the price had not gone far
beyond him the boss was watching him
curious and puzzled as if trying to interpret
the expression in carltons face and that of
his wife
  didnt i do right he demanded with
the simple directness of a child
the boss of mirage

  the engineer countered
  do you think this riot will kill off the
chances for the dam
  not much and when shes built shell
be built fair and square the waterll
come down clean to a land thats clean
well-in that case i guess its worth
the price i wonder whos going to own
finchs place now
  i dunno mebbe i will finch probly
didnt leave a will or have any heirs so the
landll go back to the state mebbe ill
buy it
  carltons mind took another tack
  did you run across the trail of jim
black he asked pointing to the papers
  sure tracks all over the place all
sorts of money passed between em
  from finch to black of course
  no thats the queer part of it from
black to finch
  why black didnt have any money
thats what i thought but look at
them receipt-books
  carlton leaned over and began pawing
at the papers everything was there-
every transaction of finchs for years back
marked down with a scrupulousness that
amounted to a mania he even had
duplicates of the receipts he gave and
these showed the trail of jim black the
more carlton looked the more interested
he became until at length his wife tapped
him on the shoulder he looked up the
darkness was gone the lamp was burning
dimly and the skies outside held the blue
haze of dawn dolan was sleeping in his
chair and snoring gently with a smile on
his face as if he were living again in the
heroic days of his youth the red embers
of the fireplace had turned to gray ashes
  fulton is dead she announced very
quietly
  dead
  carlton stared at his wife then looked
out of the window to where a bird on the
limb of a tree was just starting its first song
of the day bidding the world to waken
to life and sunshine
  the wife sighed
  why should it be like this she asked
helplessly it seems theres been nothing
but tragedy since we came
  he took her hand
  maybe its part of the price we must
pay lie said gently
  the price of our living here if i
thought that i wouldnt stay another
minute
  no it isnt the price for us its a
bigger thing than us were in it but were
not the thing itself its just the price
of civilization girl-working up through
tragedies to happiness nothing is born
without a pang and so these things are
natural
dan dolan woke them an hour
later when the sun was streaming
slantwise through the tidy curtains
the engineer was sunk in a great chair
and she was perched on its broad leathern
arm and sleeping peacefully on his shoulder
the boss was loath to spoil the picture but
the papers littering the room cried for
action
  at dolans yell the couple cajne to life
and the embarrassed wife rushed off to
attend to her belated kitchen duties
carlton arose to bring in some wood
  what are you going to do now he
asked as he stretched himself
  goin to bring this stuff into town
van dorns there you better come with
me mebbe therell be somethin doin
  thus within an hour the young engineer
and the old saloon-keeper loped through
the pass and into the long road that led
through bleak and barren lands to the
tumble-down settlement of mirage
  van dom was there and so were many
others who drank at dolans bar or played
cards at tables or lounged about the
hitcliing-racks outside and swrapped yarns
except for a subdued air of excitement
it appeared like a casual go-as-you-please
gathering of strays from every section of
the lulls and valleys of the desert county
here was a prospector with frayed clothes
and heavy beard yonder a ranch-owner
wearing expensive high boots and stetson
hat some had store-clothes with car-
tridge-belts and pistols at their hips while
others displayed the sheepskin chaps
of the range country further south some
were slouchv and dirty some clean and
still others bore the fresh dust of the road
  when the boss arrived every face was
turned toward him but beyond a casual
nod to all and a short conversation with a
miner eager to impart some news he
ignored the gathering for the time and
strode with his gunny-sack full of docu-
ments into the back of his store wjhere

adventure
the bald and smiling van dora was waiting
with his two companions
  dolan slammed book after book and file
upon file to the desk in back of liis clerks
cage
  you keep em he advised if any-
thing happens hide em the whole
countys heard about this finch trouble
and shes up in arms visitors is expected
carlton you explain things to van dorn
im goin inside and he strode into his
dance-hall
  every one lined up to the bar noisily
at a loud invitation from dolan but within
the half-darkened cage the bald-headed
government man attacked his papers as
eagerly as a fisherman with tlie prize trout
of the year
  but he admitted at length in jer-
plexity theres one thing  cant under-
stand and thats this man black heres
a batch-of receipts where hes given all sorts
of money to finch see-received of jim
black ten thousand dollars black five
thousand-forty thousand-eighteen thou-
sand where did the man get all the
money who was he agent for some
of these receipts are three years old most
of them are very recent what does it
mean
  its all beyond me admitted carlton
and then he straightened suddenly
  into his ears came a noise like distant
thunder made by the pounding hoofs of
trotting horses and coming nearer con-
stantly he wrent to the door and looked
out swinging up the street came a score
of horsemen riding close together with
spurs and bits jingling rifles slung over
shoulders and pistol-butts protruding from
many holsters
  the sheriff gasped carlton
  van dorn jumped and thrust his loot
under a heap of tents and blankets carl-
ton hastened into the dance-hall where
the boss stood in front of the bar and
chatted with a coterie of friends as if
nothing were happening the cavalcade
drew up to the building the loungers
on the porch ambled in through the door
but not a comment was made bv any one
the atmosphere seemed charged with
something quiet and chilly and deadly
in spite of the low murmur of conversation
there seemed to be a silence that shrieked
through the big board dance-hall
  and then the sheriff came in
  he stamped through the doorway at the
head of an armed delegation that acted
like a company of militia taking charge of a
rioters headquarters pointing no weapons
but lining up along the front wall and
standing ready for any tiling the other
groups of silent men massed behind dolan
toward the rear of the room
  the sheriff advanced directly toward the
towering boss of mirage
  ive come for an accountin he an-
nounced holding hands warily at his hips
what sort o madhouse you runnin
up here youre a deputy now
speak
  it was very direct and it put the boss
on the defensive instantly he stood there
the largest man in the place and the center
of all eyes figuring on how to avoid being
bullied and yet prevent a holocaust which
might exterminate the whole roomful it
was a hair-trigger situation and the boss
held his temper
  as how he inquired
  how with killins all around the place
murder an arson everywhere how about
snow how about hackett how about
finch yeh we heard about finch this
mornin on the road thats why we camc
faster how about it
  search me demurred dolan i didnt
kill him  wasnt even there
  yeh well why didnt you arrest them
that was there hey youre a deputy
sheriff aint jfou what kind o game you
playin anyhow
  the boss had stood about enough he
did not want to start hostilities between
these masses of armed men but bis choleric
temper was straining to the breaking-point
he tried hard to fight it down and at last
he succeeded
  mike he bawled to his bartender
wheres my deputys star
  i dunno mebbe shes in the nail-box
no-no i remember now you used it
to plug a leak in the drain-pipe durin that
rain shes been out there-
  go git it
  somebody snickered some one else
laughed outright even the most stem-
faced deputies smiled the incident sapped
the tension from the atmosphere instantly
though the sheriff still stood like a figure of
wrath
  mike returned in a few seconds via the
rear door
the boss of mirage
i
  i cant git it lie shouted shes
soldered in
  rip off the whole danged pipe snorted
the boss gimme that star
  rasping sounds ensued outside and then
the bartender returned with a piece of pipe
with a deputy sheriffs star stuck tightly
in the joint dolan grabbed it and thrust
it into the hands of the scowling sheriff
  i resign roared the boss i aint
vour danged deputy no more heres my
star
  the sheriff dashed the pipe to the polished
floor
  thats enough o that he snarled
this aint play he stopped and straight-
ened and pointed a grim forefinger in
the name of the state of california i arrest

for complicty in the murder of ebenezer

with the finch thing asked dolan
almost purring

mation from anybody huh-better keep

the face of the boss was thunderous

his mighty fist and advancing straight
toward the backing sheriff despite the armed
men behind him you arrest me hey

through
van dorn who had stood quietly
watching the others now came for-
ward his attitude was offhand
and conversational as if there wasnt a fire-
arm or an excitable person in the room
    in the name of the united states gov-
  ernment he announced easily showing a
  badge on his vest i hereby arrest the
  sheriff of this county for complicity in a
  wholesale plot to swindle homesteaders out
  of their lands
    a dozen rifles almost fell from paralyzed
  hands a score of men stood as if the earth
  had opened beneath them the petrified
sheriffs jawr sagged and his eyes bulged
with amazement while his face turned
white
  what-what are you givin me he
fenced
  you know what it is said van dorn
easily its about the thunder mountain
dam and the railroad we might as well
speak about it openly now the bill has
gone to congress-
    rah j elled some one
  somebody else joined in and started a
chorus of joyful profanity the stricken
deputies lowered their rifles and stared
they were regular deputies or political
friends of the sheriff or adventurous citi-
zens hastily sworn in for the anticipated
trump-card raid the latter class started
for the door milling into another group
of the sheriffs men who were standing over
the threshold
  hey yelled van dorn suddenly
stop that man
  jim black gasped carlton
  the man had been with the incon-
spicuous group at the doorway all along
unobserved until nowr he had started to
disappear but van dorn had been noting
him from the first
  the government man strode fonvard so
did carlton black saw he could not jam
through the throng quickly enough so he
turned his hand whipped to his side a
pistol flashed out and pointed straight at van
dorn the men beside the latter jumped
out of the line of fire while those behind
jim black also scattered dolan speeded
behind his bar but nobody noticed him
   quit that roure under arrest yelled
the white-faced government man to black
put up that gun
  take me invited black
  he was smiling through slit eyes and
o-ouching fonvard like a cat about to spring
  the government man wras plucky enough
but the pistol-barrel w-as unwavering and
his round face began to give forth per-
spiration he decided to spar for time
  so this is wrhere youve come to he
remarked trying to appear easy weve
searched the wrhole united states for you
joe barton a man doesntvtake a hundred
thousand dollars from an army transport
without the government keeping after him
pretty fine pretty fine dont you re-
member me the fellow who checked
your accounts in san francisco before you

adventure
breezed away three years ago come on
drop that gun quit it
  take me challenged black backing
away slowly
  men were getting behind chairs tables
walls the bar and everything else handy
the sheriff was flattening himself against
the picture of a prize-fighter his deputies
had forgotten their errand and were scat-
tered all over the place carlton was a
little to one side of van dorn standing his
ground and wondering just what to do
he did not want to produce a pistol and
perhaps start something neither did he
trust black and his weapon he therefore
kept his hands near his sides and awaited
developments black looked like a crouch-
ing panther
  and yet the bald-headed van dorn
palpably unarmed started to walk forward
while holding his empty hands out he had
made his decision he was a government
man and knew the power and weight of the
great relentless moral forces behind him
he figured that as black had been a gov-
ernment man he fully realized the useless-
ness of opposing those forces thus being
amenable to a peaceful arrest for black
the jig was up even he could see it van
dorn had not been fed full of blacks repu-
tation as a gunman neither did he believe
that any man could kill an unarmed one in
cold blood therefore part in earnest and
part as a bluff he laid his human fears
aside and advanced
  look out came a yell from the back
of the room
  black had backed to the threshold the
government man still walked forward a
little overconfident a little overeager to
make the arrest with his hand stretched
out persuasively for blacks gun for a
moment the silent crowd wondered if the
arrest were not to be made after all black
had a hunted look on his face then his
expression changed van dorn took an-
other step
 hey yelled an awed man stop
him
 but it was too late even though
black could not kill an unarmed man who
walked forward publicly with hands up
black could stop this federal agent long
enough to get away and he did blacks
pistol blazed a stream of fire right into van
doras shoulder the roar of the shot
galvanized the room the government
  man wounded purposely yelled and stag-
gered then black leaped backward
  instantly carlton jerked out his pistol
and fired madly the gun kicked in his
hand black half turned and brought the
muzzle of that deadly pistol toward him
one instant one quiver of blacks muscles
and the engineer might be in eternity
  suddenly a blast of heat and lead roared
across carltons face stunning him and
making his earsring the gust of fire blew
away part of the doorway and hurled black
straight backward like a piece of paper in a
heavy wind a stream of acrid smoke
blurred the entrance and when it cleared
away the boss behind uhe bar was taking
an empty shell from a shotgun
  black lying queerly on the porch was
a dead man
  carlton took one look and then turned
away shuddering to where van dora was
nursing his shoulder the sheriff was ap-
proaching the bar with his hands up the
boss jerked his thumb to somebody and
that man took the sheriffs armament away
after which dolan came from his trenches
and approached the suffering van dorn
  say he asked i want to know
somethin this feller black went into
pardnership with finch us in stolen money
thats clear enough but did black ever
have a sister
  the suffering man looked reproaclrful
but he gave answer
  never had a sister or any other rela-
tives
  - said the boss ruefully and
i swallowed that vam i guess im gittin
old
i one year later again the boss
rs a was preparn fr  evenings
jljhlf festivity in his enlarged dance-hall
again a knot of men congregated about the
bar or wandered around the lighted street
amid the sounds of tinkling music it was
the same old settlement and yet it had
changed a bit freight-teams were stream-
ing in with supplies for the new dam in the
hills to the northward two hotels a
barber-shop a hardware store a feed store
and a telephone exchange had added to
the number of buildings the population
had grown enormously and government
engineers construction laborers and rail-
road right-of-way men were big elements
in it
the boss of mirage

  to the north up at thunder mountain
a new town had been built overnight for
the workers to the south four miles from
the entrance to lost deer valley-and
buying its hay-a railroad camp was estab-
lished along the projected railroad line
settlers were taking up land daily in ad-
vance of the coming irrigation waters
dolans store had four clerks down at
the county-seat a new collection of officials
had just been elected the power company
was planning high-tension lines from thun-
der mountain to the coast and had the
franchises the county was booming
  with a check in his pocket for hay just
sold harry carlton dismounted from liis
horse in front of the old dance-hall and
walked inside a yell greeted him dan
dolan a little more gray-haired came
from behind the bar and extended a hairy
paw
  congratulations he roared
  then he turned to the assembled crowd
and held up his hand like a prize-fight
announcer
  gents one and aji he shouted
shake hands with harry carlton new
member of the county board of super-
visors from mirage
  they shook hands-prospectors and
miners ranchers and grain-buvers engi-
neers and laborers until finally carlton
broke away from them and dragged the
boss into the rear of his greatly enlarged
store where there was more privacy
  well shes all over he said perching
on a counter and accepting one of the
deadly cigars i owe it to you dolan and
so does the county i want to thank you
the boss waved it away
  it wasnt me he demurred if you
hadnt stacked up pretty well that first
time when you went below and the boys
looked you over youd a been passed up
you got what was cornin
  carlton chuckled
  huh with half the old gang in jail
and the rest skipped out the election was
so one-sided there wasnt any fun to it
campbell becomes superior judge by a
vote of four-thousand-and-thirty to one
wtio wrote in that other name
  i guess we neednt worry about that
responded the amiable boss hows the
wife and kid
  thats what i wanted to talk about
i	told vou over the phone about the boy
coming but i didnt tell you the rest of it
my wifes mother is head of a w c t u
and bitter about alcohol shes up at the
house now but weve decided to scandalize
her that boys going to be named after
the toughest old saloon-keeper in the
state
  dolan looked startled and then he stared
out of the door for a long time but when
the leonine old face came back toward
carlton again it was very somber and he
shook his head
  not saloon-keeper boy not for very
long anyhow times is changin youre
goin to name that boy after a merchant
so ye bring me back the tale
   by w j coe
    nprek on  ye of the restless feet
    who follow the endless trail
    though triumph attend you or defeat-
                  so ye bring me back the tale
                 trek on though your search may have no end
    though your luck hold foul or fair
    you carry the heart of an invalid
    condemned to an invalids chair
author of the laughing cavalier and a battle of wits etc
the children were all huddled
up together in one corner of
die room fitienne and valen-
tine the two eldest had their
arms round the little one as for lucile
she would have told you herself that she
felt just like a bird between two snakes-
terrified and fascinated-especially by that
little man with the pale face and the light
gray eyes and the slender white hands
unstained by toil one of which rested
lightly upon the desk and was only clenched
now and then at a word or a look from the
other man or from lucile herself
   as for that other he just tried to brow-
beat her it was not difficult for in truth
she felt frightened enough already with all
this talk of traitors and that awful threat
of the guillotine
  but lucile clamette would have re-
mained splendidly loyal in spite of all those
threats if it hadnt been for the children
she was little mother to them for father
was a cripple with speech and mind already
impaired by creeping paralysis and mama
had died when little josephine was born
and now those fiends threatened not only
her but etienne who was not fourteen
and valentine who was not much more
than ten with death unless she-luctle--
broke the solemn word which she had given
to m le marquis at first she had tried
to deny all knowledge of m le marquis
whereabouts
  i can assure m le commissairc that i
do not know she had persisted quietly
even though her heart was beating so rapidly
in her bosom that she felt as if she must
choke
  call me citizen commissary lelel had
riposted curtly i should take it as a
proof that your aristocratic sentiments are
not so deep-rooted as they appear to be
yes citizen murmured lucile under
her breath
  then the other one he with the pale
eyes and the slender white hands leaned
fonvard over the desk and the poor girl
felt as if a mighty and unseen force were
holding her tight so tight that she could
neither move nor breathe nor turn her gaze
away from those pale compelling eyes in
the remote corner little josephine was
whimpering and etiennes big dark eyes
were fixed bravely upon his eldest sister
  there there little citizeness the
awful man said in a voice that sounded
low and almost caressing there is noth-
ing to be frightened of no one is going
to hurt you or your little family we only
want you to be reasonable you have
promised to your former employer that
you would never tell any one of his where-
abouts well we dont ask you to tell us
anything all that we want you to do is
to write a letter to m le marquis-one
that i myself will dictate to you ou
have written to m le marquis before now
on business matters have you not
  yes monsieur yes citizen stam-
mered lucile through her tears father
was bailiff to m le marquis until he became
a cripple and now- i-
  do not write any letter lucile 
fitienne suddenly broke in with forceful
vehemence it is a trap set by these
miscreants to entrap m le marquis
  there was a seconds silence in the room
needs must

after this sudden outburst on the part of
the lad then the man with the pale face
said quietly
  citizen lebel order the removal of
that boy let him be kept in custody
till he has learned to hold his tongue
  but before lebel could speak to the
two soldiers who were standing on guard
at the door lucile had uttered a loud cry
of agonized protest
  no no monsieur that is-citizen
she implored do not take etienne away
he will be silent i promise you that he
will be silent only do not take him away
fitienne my little one she added turning
her tear-filled eyes to her brother i
entreat thee to hold thy tongue
  the others too clung to etienne and
the lad awed and subdued relapsed into
silence
  now then resumed lebel roughly
after a while let us get on with this
business i am sick to death of it it has
lasted far too long already
  he fixed his bloodshot protruding eyes
upon lucile and continued gruffly
  now listen to me my wench for this
is going to be my last word citizen
chauvelin here has already been very
lenient with you by allowing this let lea
business if i had my way id make you
speak here and now as it is you either
sit dowti and write the letter at citizen
chauvelins dictation at once or i send
you with that impudent brother of yours
and your imbecile father to jail on a charge
of treason against the state for aiding and
abetting the enemies of the republic and
you know what the consequences of such
a charge usually are the other two brats
will go to a house of correction there to
be detained during the pleasure of the
committee of public safety that is my
last word he reiterated fiercely now
which is it to be
  he paused and the girls wan cheeks
turned the color of lead she moistened her
lips once or twice with her tongue beads
of perspiration appeared at the roots of
her hair she gazed helplessly at her tor-
mentors not daring to look on those three
huddled-up little figures there in the
corner
  a few seconds sped away in silence the
man with the pale eyes rose and pushed
his chair away he went to the window
and stood there with his back to the room
those slender white hands of his clasped
behind him neither the commissary nor
the girl appeared to interest him further
he was just gazing out of the window
  the other was still sprawiing beside the
desk liis large coarse hand-how different
his hands were-was beating a devils
tatoo upon the arm of his chair
      after a fewr minutes lucile made
iinufl a solent effort to compose herself
wiped the moisture from her pallid
forehead and dried the tears wrhich still
hung upon her lashes then she rose from
her chair and walked resolutely up to the
desk
  i will write the letter she said simply
  lebel gave a snort of satisfaction but
the other did not move from his position
near the window the boy etienne had
uttered a cry of passionate protest
  do not give m le marquis away
lucile he said hotly i am not afraid
to die
  but lucile had made up her mind how
could she do otherwise with these awful
threats hanging over them all she and
etienne and poor father gone and the two
young ones in one of those awful houses
of correction wrhere children were taught
to hate the church to shun the sacraments
and to blaspheme god
  what am i to write she asked dully
resoluteh closing her ears against her
brothers protest
  lebel pushed pen ink and paper toward
her and she sat down ready to begin
  write now came in a curt command
from the man at the window
  and lucile wrote at his dictation
monseecr le m-vrqcis
  we are in grave trouble my brother fiticnne
and i have been arrested on a charge of treason
this means the guillotine for us and for poor father
who can no longer speak the two little ones are
to be sent to one of those dreadful houses of cor-
rection where children are taught to deny god
and to blaspheme you alone can save us si lc
marquisi i beg you on my knees to do it the
citizen commissary here says that you have in
your possession certain papers which are of great
value to the state and that if i can persuade you
to give these up etienne father and i and the
little ones will be left unmolested m le marquis
you once said that you could never adequately
repay my poor father for all his devotion in your
service you can do it now m lc marquis by
saving us all i will be at the chateau a week from
today i entreat you m ur marquis to come to
me then and to bring the papers with you or

adventure
if you can devise some other means of sending the
papers to me i will obey your behests
        i am m u marquis
            your faithful and devoted servant
lucan clamette
  the pen dropped from the unfortunate
girls fingers she buried her face in her
hands and sobbed convulsively the chil-
dren were silent awed and subdued-tired
out too only fitiennes dark eyes were
fixed upon liis sister with a look of mute
reproach
  lebel had made no attempt to interrupt
the flow of liis colleagues dictation only
once or twice did a hastily smothered
what die - of astonishment escape
his lips now when the letter was finished
and duly signed he drew it to him and
strewed the sand over it chauveiin
more impassive than ever was once more
gazing out of the window
  how are the ci-devant aristos to get this
letter die commissary asked
  it must be put in the hollow tree which
stands by the side of the stable gate at
montorgueil whispered lucile
  and the aristos will find it there
  yes m le vicomte goes there once
or twice a week to see if there is anything
there from one of us
  they are in hiding somewhere close by
then
  but to this the girl gave no reply in-
deed she felt as if any word now might
choke her
  well no matter where they are the
inhuman wretch resumed with brutal cyn-
icism weve got them now-both of them
marquis vicomte he added and spat
on the ground to express his contempt of
such tides citizen montorgueil father
and son-thats all they are and as such
theyll walk up in state to make their bow
to mine la guillolinel
  may we go now stammered lucile
dirough her tears
  lebel nodded in assent and the girl rose
and turned to walk toward the door she
called to the children and the little ones
clustered round her skirts like chicks
around the mother hen only fitienne
remained aloof wradiful against his sister
for what he deemed her treachery
  women have no sense of honor he
muttered to himself with all the pride of
conscious manhood
  but lucile felt more than ever like a bird
who is vainly trying to evade the clutches
of a fowler she gathered the two little
ones around her then with a cry like
a wounded doe she ran quickly out of the
room
ii
as soon as the sound of the chil-
drens footsteps had died away
down the corridor lebel turned
with a grunt to his sdll silent companion
  and now citizen chauveiin he said
roughly perhaps you will be good enough
to explain what is the meaning of all this
tomfoolery
  tomfoolery citizen queried the other
blandly what tomfoolery pray
why about those papers growled
lebel savagely cuie you for an inter-
fering busybody it was i who got infor-
mation diat those pestilential aristos the
montorgueils far from having fled the
country are in hiding somewhere in my
district i could have made the girl give
up their hiding-place pretty soon without
any help from you what right had you
to interfere i should like to know
  you know quite well what right i had
citizen lebel replied chauveiin with
perfect composure the right conferred
upon me by the committee of public
safety of whom i am sdll an unworthy
member they sent me down here to lend
you a hand in an investigarion which is of
grave importance to them
  i know that retorted lebel sulkily
but why have you invented the story of
the papers
  it is no invention citizen rejoined
chauveiin with slow emphasis the
papers do exist they are in the possession
of the ci-dcvaut montorgueils father and
son to capture the two aristos would be
not only a blunder but also criminal folly
unless we can lay hands on the papers at
the same time
  but what in satans name are those
papers ejaculated lebel with a fierce
oath
  think citizen lebel think was
chauvelins cool rejoinder metliinks you
might arrive at a pretty shrewd guess
then as the others bluster and bounce
suddenly collapsed under his colleagues
calm accusing gaze the latter continued
with impressive deliberation
the papers which the two aristos have
needs must

in their possession citizen are receipts for
money for bribes paid to various members
of the committee of public safety by royal-
ist agents for the overthrow of our glorious
republic you know all about them do
you not
  while chauvelin spoke a look of furtive
terror had crept into lebels eyes his
checks became the color of lead but even
so he tried to keep up an air of incredulity
and of amazement
  i he exclaimed what do you
mean citizen chauvelin what should
i know about it
  some of those receipts are signed with
your name citizen lebel riposted chau-
velin forcefully bah he added and a
tone of savage contempt crept into his even
calm voice now henriot foucquier
ducros and the whole gang of you are in
it up to the neck trafficking with our
enemies trading with england taking
bribes from every quarter for working
against the safety of the republic ah
if i had my way i would let the hatred
of those aristos take its course i would
let the montorgueils and the whole pack
of royalist agents publish those infamous
proofs of your treachery and of your base-
ness to the entire world and send the whole
lot of you to the guillotine
  he had spoken with so much concen-
trated fury and the hatred and contempt
expressed in his pale eyes were so fierce
that an involuntary ice-cold shiver ran
down the length of lebels spine but
even so he would not give in he tried to
sneer and to keep up something of his
former surly defiance
  bah he exclaimed and with a lower-
ing glance he gave hatred for hatred and
contempt for contempt what can you
do an i am not mistaken there is no
more discredited man in france today
than the unsuccessful tracker of the scarlet
pimpernel
  the taunt went home it was chauve-
lins turn now to lose countenance to pale
to the lips the glow of virtuous indig-
nation died out of his eyes his look became
furtive and shamed
  you are right citizen lebel he said
calmly after a while recriminations be-
tween us are out of place i am a dis-
credited man as you say perhaps it
would have been better if the committee
had sent me long ago to expiate my failures
on the guillotine i should at least not
have suffered as i am suffering now daily
hourly humiliation at thought of the
triumph of an enemy whom i hate with a
passion that consumes my very soul but
do not let us speak of me he went on
quietly there are graver affairs at
stake just now than mine own
  lebel said nothing more for the moment
perhaps he was satisfied at the success of
his taunt even though the terror within
his craven soul still caused the cold shiver
to course up and down his spine chauvelin
had once more turned to the window
his gaze was fixed upon the distance far
away
  the window gave on the north that
way in a straight line lay calais boulogne
england-where he had been made to
suffer such bitter humiliation at the hands
of his elusive enemy far out to the west
lay nantes the scene of his latest defeat
and immediately before him was paris
where the very walls seemed to echo that
mocking laugh of the daring englishman
which would haunt him even to his
grave
   lebel unnerved by his colleagues silence
broke in gruffly at last
  well then citizen he said with a
feeble attempt at another sneer if you
are not thinking of sending us all to the
guillotine just yet perhaps you will be
good enough to explain just how the matter
stands
  fairly simply alas replied chauvelin
dryly the two montorgueils father
and son under assumed names were the
royalist agents who succeeded in suborning
men such as you citizen and the whole
gang of you we have tracked them down
to this district have confiscated their
lands and ransacked the old chateau for
valuables and so on twro days later the
first of a series of pestilential anonvmous
letters reached the committee of public
safety threatening the publication of a
whole series of compromising documents if
the marquis and the yicomte de montor-
gueil were in any way molested and if all
the montorgueil property is not immedi-
ately restored
  i suppose it is quite certain that those
receipts and documents do exist sug-
gested lebel
  perfectly-certain one of the receipts
signed by henriot was sent as a specimen

adventure
  my- ejaculated lebel and wiped
the cold sweat from his brow
  yes youll all want help from some-
where retorted chauvelin coolly from
above or from below if the people get to
know what miscreants you are  do be-
lieve he added with a vicious snap of his
thin lips that they would cheat the
guillotine of you and in the end drag you
out of the tumbrils and tear you to pieces
limb from limb
  once more that look of furtive terror
crept into the commissarys bloodshot eyes
  thank the lord he muttered that
we were able to get hold of the jvench
clamette
  at my suggestion retorted chauvelin
curtly i always believe in threatening
the weak if you want to coerce the strong
the montorgueils can not resist the wenchs
appeal even if they do at first we can
apply the screw by clapping one of the
young ones in jail within a week we shall
have those papers citizen lebel and
if in the meanwhile no one commits a
further blunder we can close the trap on
the montorgueils without further trouble
lebel said nothing more and after a
while chauvelin went back to the desk
picked up the letter which poor lucile had
written and watered with her tears folded
it deliberately and slipped it into the inner
pocket of his coat
  what are you going to do queried
lebel anxiously
  drop this letter into the hollow tree
by the side of the stable gate at montor-
gueil replied chauvelin simply
  what exclaimed the other your-
self
  why of course think you i would
entrust such an errand to another living
soul
ill
ryp several hours later when the
two children had had their dinner
and had settled down to play in
the garden and father had been cozily tucked
up for his afternoon sleep lucile called
her brother etienne to her the boy had
not spoken to her since that terrible time
spent in the presence of those two awful
men he had eaten no dinner only sat
glowering staring straight out before him
from time to time throwing a look of burn-
ing reproach upon his sister now when
she called to him he tried to run away
and was half-way up the stairs before she
could seize hold of him
  etienne nwn petit she implored as
her arms closed around his shrinking figure
  let me go lucile the boy pleaded
obstinately
  mon petit listen to me she pleaded
all is not lost if you will stand by me
  all is lost lucile etienne cried
striving t keep back a flood of passionate
tears honor is lost your treachery
lias disgraced us all if m k marquis and
m le viconik are brought to the guillotine
their blood will be upon our heads
  upon mine alone my little etienne
she said sadly but god alone can judge
me it was a terrible alternative m le
marquis-or you and valentine and little
josephine and poor father who is so help-
less but dont let us talk of it all all
is not lost i am sure the last time that
i spoke with m k marquis-it was in
february do you remember-he was full
of hope and oh so kind well he told
me then that if ever i or any of us here
were in such grave trouble that we did not
know where to turn one of us was to put
on our very oldest clothes look as like a
barefooted beggar as we could and then go
to paris to a place called the cabaret de la
liberte in the rue christine there we
are to ask for the citizen rateau and we
are to tell him all our troubles whatever
they are well we are in such trouble
now tnon petit that we dont know where
to turn put on the very oldest clothes
little one and run barefooted into paris
find the citizen rateau and tell him just
what has happened the letter which
they have forced me to write the threats
which they held over me if i did not write
it-everything dost hear
  already the boys eyes were glowing
the thought that he individually could do
something to retrieve the awful shame of
his sisters treachery spurred him to ac-
tivity it needed no persuasion on luciles
part to induce him to go she made him
put on some old clothes and stuffed a piece
of bread and cheese into his breeches
pocket
  it was close upon eight kilometers to
paris but that run was one of the happiest
which etienne had ever made and he
did it barefooted too feeling neither fatigue
nor soreness despite the hardness of the
needs must

road after a three weeks drought which
had turned mud into hard cakes and ruts
into fissures which tore the lads feet till
they bled
  he did not reach the cabaret de la
liberte till nightfall and when he got
there he hardly dared to enter the filth
the squalor the hoarse voices which rose
from that cellar-like place below the level
of the street repelled the country-bred lad
were it not for the desperate urgency of his
errand he never would have dared to enter
as it was the fumes of alcohol and steam-
ing dirty clothes nearly choked him and
he could scarcely stammer the name of
citizen rateau when a gruff voice present-
ly demanded his purpose
  he realized now how tired he was and
how hungry he had not thought to pause
in order to consume the small provision of
bread and cheese with which thoughtful
lucile had provided him now he was
ready to faint when a loud guffaw which
echoed from one end of the horrible place
to the other greeted his timid request
  citizen rateau the same gruff voice
called out hilariously why there he is
here citizen theres a blooming aristo
to see you
  etienne turned his weary eyes to the
corner which was being indicated to him
there he saw a huge creature sprawling
across a bench his long powerful limbs
stretched out before him citizen rateau
was clothed rather than dressed in a soiled
shirt ragged breeches and tattered stock-
ings with shoes down at heel and a faded
crimson cap his face looked congested
and sunken about the eyes he appeared
to be asleep for stertorous breathing came
at intervals from between his parted lips
every now and then a racking cough
seemed to tear at his broad chest
  etienne gave him one look shuddering
with horror despite himself at the aspect
of this bloated wretch from whom salvation
was to come the whole place seemed to
him hideous and loathsome in the extreme
what it all meant he could not understand
all that he knew was that this seemed
like another hideous trap into which he
and lucile had fallen and that he must
fly from it-fly at all costs before he be-
trayed m le marquis still further to these
drink-sodden brutes another moment
and he feared that he might faint the
din of a bibulous song rang in his ears the
reek of alcohol turned him giddy and sick
he had only just enough strength to turn
and totter back into the open there his
senses reeled the lights in the houses oppo-
site began to dance wildly before his eyes-
and he remembered nothing more
          iv
there is nothing now in the whole
countryside quite so desolate and
forlorn as the chateau of montor-
gueil with its once magnificent park now
overgrown with weeds its encircling walls
broken dow-n its terraces devastated and
its stately gates rusty and tom
  just by the side of what was known in
happier times as the stable gate there stands
a hollow tree it is not inside the park but
just outside and it shelters the narrow
lane which skirts the park walls against the
blaze of the afternoon sun
  its beneficent  shade is a favorite spot
for an afternoon siesta for there is a bit of
green sward under the tree and all along
the side of the road but as the shades
of evening gather in the lane is usually
deserted shunned by the neighboring
peasantry on account of its eery loneliness
so different from the former bustle which
used to reign around the park gates when
m le marquis and his family were still in
residence nor does the lane lead any-
where for it is a mere loop which gives
on the main road at either end
  henri de montorgueil chose a peculiarly
dark night early in september for one of his
periodical visits to the hollow tree it was
close on nine oclock when he passed
stealthily down the feme keeping close
to the park wall a soft rain was falling
the first since the prolonged drought and
though it made the road heavy and slippery
in places it helped to deaden the sound
of the young mans furtive footsteps
  the air except for the patter of the rain
was absolutely still henri de montor-
gueil paused from time to time with neck
craned forward even sense on the alert
listening like any poor hunted beast for
the slightest sound which might betray
the approach of danger
  as many a time before he reached the
hollow tree in safety felt for and found
in the usual place the letter which the
unfortunate girl lucile had written to him
then with it in his hand he turned to the

adventure
stable gate it had long since ceased to
be kept locked and bared pillaged and
ransacked by order of the committee of
public safety there was nothing left inside
the park walls worth keeping under lock
and key
  henri slipped stealthily through the
gates and made his way along the drive
every stone every nook and cranny of
his former home was familiar to him and
he turned into a shed where in former times
wheelbarrows and garden tools were wont
to be kept now it was full of debris
lumber of every sort a more safe or
secluded spot could not be imagined
henri crouched in the farthermost corner
of the shed then from his belt he de-
tached a small dark lantern opened its
shutter and with the aid of the tiny dim
light read the contents of the letter
  for a long while after that he remained
quite still-as still as a man who has
received a stunning blow-on the head and
has partis lost consciousness the blow
was indeed a staggering one lucile cla-
met te with the invincible power of her own
helplessness was demanding the surrender
of a weapon which had been a safeguard
for the montorgueils all this while the
papers which compromised a number of
influential members of the committee of
public safety had been the most perfect
arms of defense against persecution and
spoliation
  and now these were to be given up oh
there could be no question of that even
before consulting with his father henri
knew that the papers would have to be
given up they were clever those revo-
lutionaries the thought of holding inno-
cent children as hostages could only have
originated in minds attuned to the villainies
of devils but it was unthinkable that the
children should suffer
  after a while the young man roused
himself from the torpor into which the
suddenness of this awful blow had plunged
him by the light of the lantern he
scribbled a few words on a scrap of paper
tom from his pocketbook
my rear loctle
   as you say our debt to your father and to you all
never could he adequately repaid you and the
children shall never suffer whilst we have the
power to saveyou you will find the papers in
the receptacle you know of inside the chimney
of what used to by my mothers boudoir you
will find the receptacle unlocked one day before
the term you name i myself will place the papers
there for you with them my father and i do give
up our lives to save you and the little ones from
the persecution of those fiends may the good
god guard you all
  he signed the letter with his initials
h de m then he crept back to the gate
and dropped the message into the hollow
of the tree
  a quarter of an hour later henri de
montorgueil was wending his way back
to the hiding-place which had sheltered
him and his father for so long silence
and darkness soon held undisputed sway
once more around the hollow tree even
the rain had ceased its gentle pattering
from far away came the sound of a church
bell striking the hour of ten then nothing
more
  a few more minutes of absolute silence
then something dark and furtive began
to move out of the long grass which bor-
dered the roadside-something that in
movement was almost like a snake it
dragged itself along close to the ground
making no sound as it moved soon it
reached the hollow tree rose to the height
of a man and flattened itself against the
tree trunk then it put out a hand felt
for the hollow receptacle and groped for
the missive which henri de montorgueil
had dropped in there a while ago
  the next moment a tiny ray of light
gleamed through the darkness like a star
a small almost fragile figure of a man
dressed in the mud-stained clothes of a
country yokel had turned up the shutter
of a small lantern bv its flickering light
he deciphered the letter which henri de
montorgueil had written to lucile clamette
one day before the term you name
i myself will place the papers there for you
  a sigh of satisfaction quickly suppressed
came through his thin colorless lips and
the light of the lantern caught the flash
of triumph in his pale inscrutable eyes
  then the light was extinguished im-
penetrable darkness swallowed up that
slender mysterious figure again
v
six days had gone by since chauveiin
had delivered his cruel either-or
to poor little lucile clamette three
since he had found henri de montorgueils
reply to the girls appeal in the hollow of
needs must
i
the tree since then he had made a careful
investigation of the chateau and soon he
was able to settle it in his own mind as to
which room had been the boudoir of
madame la marquise in the past it was
a small apartment having direct access
to the first landing of the staircase and the
one window gave on the rose garden at
the back of the house inside the monu-
mental hearth at an arms length up the
wide chimney a receptacle had been con-
trived in the brickwork with a small iron
door which opened and closed with a secret
spring chauvelin whose nefarious calling
had rendered him proficient in such mat-
ters had soon mastered the workings of
that spring he could now open and close
the iron door at will
  up to a late hour on the sixth night of
this weary waiting the receptacle inside
the chimney was still empty that night
chauvelin had determined to spend at the
chateau he could not have rested else-
where
  even his colleague lebel could not know
what the possession of those papers would
mean to the discredited agent of the com-
mittee of public safety with them in his
hands he could demand rehabilitation
he could purchase immunity from those
sneers which had been so galling to his
arrogant soul-sneers which had become
more and more marked more and more
unendurable above all more and more
menacing as he piled up failure on failure
with every encounter with the scarlet
pimpernel
  immunity and rehabilitation this ould
mean that he could once more measure
his wits and his power with that audacious
enemy who had brought about his downfall
  in lhe name of satan bring us those
papers robespierre himself had cried
vyith unwonted passion ere he sent him out
on this important mission none of us
could stand the scandal of such disclosures
it would mean absolute ruin for us all
  and chauvelin that night as soon as
the shades of evening had drawn in took
up his stand in the chateau in the small
inner room which was contiguous to the
boudoir
  here he sat beside the open wondow for
hour upon hour his every sense on the
alert listening for the first footfall upon
the gravel path below though the hours
went by leaden-footed he was neither
excited nor anxious the clamette family
was such a precious hostage that the
montorgueils were bound to comply with
luciles demand for the papers by every
dictate of honor and of humanity
  while we have those people in our
power chauvelin had reiterated to him-
self more than once during the course of
his long vigil even that meddlesome
scarlet pimpernel can do nothing to save
those cursed montorgueils
  the night was dark and still not a
breath of air stirred the branches of the
trees or the shrubberies in the park any
footsteps however wary must echo through
that perfect and absolute silence chauve-
lins keen pale eyes tried to pierce the
gloom in the direction whence in all proba-
bility the aristo would come vaguely he
wondered if it would be henri de montor-
gueil or the old marquis himself who would
bring the papers
  bah whichever one it is he mut-
tered we can easily get the other once
those abominable papers are in our hands
and even if both lhe aristos escape he
added menially  lis no matter once we
have the papers
  far away a distant church bell struck
the midnight hour the stillness of the
air had become oppressive a kind of
torpor bom of intense fatigue lulled the
terrorists senses to somnolence his head
fell forward on his breast
vi
suddenly a shiver of excite-
ment went right through him he
was fully awake now with glowing
eyes wide open and the icy calm of perfect
confidence ruling every nerve the sound
of stealthy footsleps had reached his ear
  he could see nothing either outside or
in but his fingers felt for the pistol wrhich
he carried in his belt the aristo was evi-
dently alone only one solitary footstep
was approaching the chateau
  chauvelin had left ajar the door which
gave on the boudoir the staircase was
on the other side of that fateful room and
the door leading to that was closed a
few minutes of tense expectancy went by
then through the silence there came the
sound of furtive footsteps on the stairs
the creaking of a loose board and finally
the stealthy opening of the door

adventure
  in all liis adventurous carcer chauvelin
had never fell so calm his heart beat
quite evenly and his senses were undis-
turbed by the slightest tingling of his
nerves the stealthy sounds in the next
room brought the movements of the aristo
perfectly clearly before his menial vision
the latter was earning a small dark lantern
as soon as he entered he flashed its light
about the room then he deposited the
lantern on the floor close beside the hearth
and started to feel up die chimney for the
hidden receptacle
  chauvelin watched him now as a cat
watches a mouse savoring these few mo-
ments of anticipated triumph noiselessly
he pushed open the door which gave on the
boudoir by the feeble light of the lantern
on the ground he could only see the vague
outline of the aristos back bending for-
ward to his task but a thrill went through
him as he saw a bundle of papers lying on
tiie ground close by
  everything was ready the trap was set
here was a complete victor at last it was
obviously the young vicomte de mont-
orgueil who had come to do the deed his
head was up the chimney even now the
old marquiss back would have looked nar-
rower and more fragile chauvelin held his
breath then he gave a sharp little cough
and took the pistol from his belt
  the sound caused the aristo to turn
the next moment a loud and merry laugh
roused the dormant echoes of the old cha-
teau and a pleasant drawling voice said in
english
  i am demmed if this is not my dear old
friend m chambertin zounds sir whod
have thought of meeting you here
  had a cannon suddenly exploded at
chauvelins feet he would have felt less
unnerved for the space of two heart-
beats he stood there his eyes glued on
his arch-enemy that execrated scarlet
pimpernel whose mocking glance even
through the intervening gloom seemed to
have deprived him of consciousness but
that phase of helplessness only lasted for a
moment the next all the marvelous possi-
bilities of this encounter flashed through the
terrorists keen mind
  everything was ready the trap was
set the unfortunate clamettes were still
the bait which now would bring a far more
noble quarry into the mesh than ever he-
chauvelin-had dared to hope
    he raised his pistol ready to fire but
 already sir percy blakeney was on him
 and with a swift movement which the other
 was too weak to resist he wrenched the
 weapon from his enemys grasp
   why how hasty you are my dear m
 chambertin he said lightly surely you
 are not in such a hurry to put a bullet into
 me
   the position now was one which would
 liave made even a braver man than chau-
 velin quake he stood alone and unarmed
 in face of an enemy from whom he could
 expect no mercy but even so his first
 thought was not of escape he had not
 only appraised his own danger but also the
 immense power which he held while the
 clamettes remained as hostages in the
 hands of his colleague lebel
   you have me at a disadvantage sir
 percy he said speaking every whit as
 coolly as his foe  but only momentarily
 you can kill me of course but if  do not
 return from this expedition not only safe
 and sound but with a certain packet of
 papers in my hands my colleague lebel
 has instructions to proceed at once against
 the girl clamette and the whole family
    i know that well enough rejoined sir
 percy with a quaint laugh i know what
  venemous reptiles you and those of your
 kidney are you certainly do owe your life
 at the present moment to the unfortunate
 girl whom you are persecuting with such in-
 famous callousness
   chauvelin drew a sigh of relief the
 situation was shaping itself more to his sat-
 isfaction already through the gloom he
 could vaguely discern the englishmans
 massive form standing a few paces away
 one hand buried in his breeches pocket the
 other still holding t he pistol on the ground
 close by the hearth was the small lantern
 and in its dim light the packet of papers
 gleamed white and tempting in the dark-
 ness chauvelins keen eyes had fastened
 on it and saw the form of receipt for money
 with henriots signature which he recog-
 nized on the top
   he himself had never felt so calm the
 only thing he could regret was that he was
 alone half a dozen men now and this
 impudent foe could indeed be brought to his
 knees and this time there would be no
 risks taken no chances for escape some-
 how it seemed to chauvelin as if something
 of the scarlet pimpernels audacity and
needs must

foresight had gone from him as he stood
there looking broad and physically power-
ful there was something wavering and unde-
cided in his attitude as if the edge had been
taken off his former recklessness and en-
thusiasm he had brought the compromis-
ing papers here and had no doubt helped the
montorgueils to escape but while lucile
clamette and her family were under the eye
of lebel no amount of impudence could
force a successful bargaining
it was chauveiin now who ap-
peared the more keen and the more
alert the englishman seemed un-
decided what to do next and remained
silent toying with the pistol he even
smothered a yawn chauveiin saw his op-
portunity with the quick movement of a
cat pouncing upon a mouse he stooped and
seized that packet of papers and would then
and there have made a dash for the door
with them only that as he seized the
packet the string which held it together
gave way and the papers were scattered all
over the floor
  receipts for money compromising let-
ters no blank sheets of paper all of
them-all except the one which had lain
tantalizingly on the top-the one receipt
signed by citizen henriot sir percy
laughed lightly
  did you really think my good friend
he said that i would be such a demmed
fool as to place my best wreapon so readily
to your hand
  your best weapon sir percy retorted
chauveiin with a sneer what use is it to
you while we hold lucile clamette
  while i hold lucile clamette you
mean my dear m chambertin riposted
blakeney with elaborate blandness
  you hold lucile clamette bah i
defy you to drag a whole family like that
out of our clutches the man a cripple the
children helpless and you think they can
escape our vigilance when all our men are
warned how do you think they are going
to get across the river sir percy when every
bridge is closely watched how will they
get across paris when at every gate our men
are on the lookout for them
  they cant do it my dear m cham-
bertin rejoined sir percy blandly else
i were not here
  then as chauveiin-fuming irritated
despite himself as he always was when he
encountered that impudent englishman-
shrugged his shoulders in token of contempt
blakeneys powerful grasp suddenly clutched
his arm
  let us understand one another my
good m chambertin he said coolly
those unfortunate clamettes as you say
are too helpless and too numerous to
smuggle across paris with any chance of
success therefore i look to you to take
them under your protection they are all
stowed away comfortably at this moment
in a conveyance wiiich i have provided for
them that conveyance is waiting at the
bridge-head now we could not cross with-
out your help we could not get across paris
without your august presence and your tri-
color scarf of office so you are coming
with us my dear m chambertin he con-
tinued and with force which was quite ir-
resistible he began to drag his enemy after
him toward the door you are going to
sit in that conveyance with the clamettes
and i myself will have the honor to drive
you and at every bridge-head you will
show your pleasing countenance and your
scarf of office to the guard and demand free
passage for yourself and your family as a
representative member of the committee of
public safety
  and then well enter paris by the porte
dlvry and leave it by the balignolles and
everywhere your charming presence will lull
the guards suspicions to rest i pray you
come there is no time to consider at
noon tomorrow without a moments grace
my friend sir andrew ffoulkes wrho has the
papers in his possession will dispose of them
as he thinks best unless i myself claim
them from him
  while he spoke he continued to drag his
enemy along with him with an assurance
and an impudence which was past belief
chauveiin wras trying to collect his thoughts
a whirl of conflicting plans wrere running
riot in his mind the scarlet pimpernel in
his power at any point on the road he
could deliver him up to the nearest guard
and then still hold the clamettes and de-
mand the papers   
  too late my dear m chambertin
sir percys mocking voice broke in as
if divining his thoughts you do not
know where to find my friend ffoulkes
and at noon tomorrow if i do not arrive to
claim those papers there will not be a single
ragamuffin in paris who will not be crying

adventure
your shame and that of your precious col-
leagues upon the housetops
  chauvelins whole nervous system was
writhing with the feeling of impotence
mechanically unresisting now he followed
his enemy down the main staircase of the
chateau and out through the wide open
gates he could not bring himself to be-
lieve that he had been so completely foiled-
that this impudent adventurer had him
once more in the hollow of liis hand
  in the name of satan bring us back
those papers robespierre had com-
manded and now he-chauvelin-was left
in a maze of doubt and the vita alterna-
tive was hammering in his brain the scar-
let pimpernel-or those papers which
in satans name was the more important
passion whispered the scarlet pimper-
nel but common sense and the fulure of
his party the whole future of the revolu-
tion mayhap demanded those compro-
mising papers and all the while he fol-
lowed that relentless enemy through the
avenues of the park and down the lonely
lane overhead the trees of the forest of
sucy nodding in a gentle breeze seemed to
mock his perplexity
  he had not arrived at a definite decision
wrhen the river came in sight and a carriage-
lantem threw a shaft of dim light through
the mist-laden air now he felt as if he
were in a dream he was thrust unresist-
ing into a closed chaise wherein he felt the
presence of several other people-children
and an old man wrho was muttering cease-
lessly as in a dream he answered ques-
tions at the bridge to a guard wrhom he
knew well
  you know me armand chauvelin of
the committee of public safety
  as in a dream he heard the curt words of
command-
  pass on in the name of the republic
and all the while the thought hammered
in his brain
  something must be done this is im-
possible this can not be it is not i-
chauvelin-who am sitting here helpless
unresisting it is not that impudent scarlet
pimpernel who is sit ting there before me on
the box driving me to utter humilia-
tion
  and yet it was all true all real the
clamette children were sitting in front of
him clinging to lucile terrified of him even
now the old man was beside him-im-
becile and ununderstanding the boy et-
iennc was up on the box next to that auda-
cious adventurer whose broad back ap-
peared to chauvelin like a rock on which all
his hopes and dreams must forever be
shattered
  the chaise rattled triumphantly through
the batignolles it was then broad day-
light a brilliant early autumn day after
the rains the sun the keen air all
mocked chauvclins helplessness his hu-
miliation long before noon they passed
st denis here the chaise turned off
the main road halted at a small wayside
house-nothing more than a cottage after
which everything seemed more dreamlike
than ever all that chauvelin remem-
bered of it afterward was that he was once
more alone m a room with his enemy who
had demanded his signature to a number of
safe-conducts ere he finally handed over the
packet of papers to him
  how do i know that they are all here
he heard himself vaguely muttering while
his trembling fingers handled that precious
packet
  thats just it his tormentor retorted
airily you dont know i dont know
myself he added with a light laugh
and personally i dont see how either of us
can possibly ascertain in the meanwhile
i must bid you an revoir my dear m
chambertin i am sorry that i can not
provide you with a conveyance and you
will have to walk several kilometers ere you
meet one i fear me we in the mean-
while will be well on our way to dieppe
where my yacht the day-dream lies at
anchor and i do not think that it will be
worth your while to try to overtake us i
thank you for the sale-conducts they
will make our journey exceedingly pleasant
shall i give your regards to m le marquis
de montorgueilor to m le vicomtc they
are on board the day-dream you know
oh i was forgetting lady blakeney de-
sired to be remembered to you
  the next moment he was gone chau-
velin standing at the window of the way-
side house saw- sir percy blakeney once
more mount the box of the chaise this
time he had sir andrew ffoulkes beside
him the clamette family were huddled
together-happy and free-inside the ve-

west africa and funkitis
            by thomas s miller
tiey call it the white alans grave
that western bulge in the pear-shape of
africathat comprises the gold coast
ivory coast and ominous term the
fever coast fever coast and as if
that name were not sufficiently frightening the
young official or the young man going to a trading-
station on the niger has to run the gantlet of
horrible tales of native deviltry and the insidious
ways of fever it is a popular sport on the
out voyage for the ships officers and old coasters
to pump these tales into the newcomer and by
dint of insistence and gravity of expression to
break through his morale so that by the time
the ship noses into the exotic fetid niger delta
and dumps him into the silent brooding reeking
stagnant mangrove swamps his nerves are tensioned
to the worst
  perhaps his first sight is an emaciated white
being carried aboard ship to die at sea and spare
the colonys mortality statistics then there is
bound to be an idle white around to show him the
sights he will be taken to a large shed where kit-
bags and steamer-trunks are piled high and bear
the appalling epitaph effects of j- and r- and
m- deceased he may be a bidder at one of
the pathetic little auctions of these effects and do
his share in boosting the prices for the benefit
of a mother or widow and orphans over the sea
  he lies around that reeking swamp waiting
orders nervously expectant of liis first dose
his baptismal fever which the few whites in envy
of his beefy cheeks and obtrusive health take an
unholy delight in predicting if he manages to
escape for a couple of weeks he becomes the target
of serious mock-sympathy and doleful prophecy
  if youre not inoculated before the heat and
canned chop and the mosquitoes have enervated
you its a ten-to-one shot you croak thats the
way it was with s- he-
  here follows a distressing tale he will take to
surreptitiously popping a clinical thermometer
in his mouth
  man he is told youve got fever only you
dont know it
  his life seems to hang on the verdict of the
mercury he is victimized by a popular joke
he is given an unreliable thermometer that adds
a few degrees to the actual condition or the mercury
has been surreptitiously boosted come orders for
him to proceed to a certain station instantly he
is the focus of long commiserating faces and cruel
sympathy
  thats the rottenest hole in nigeria j- died
up there and when r- went up to relieve b-
all he found of b- was a mound in the swamp
the niggers said he died of fever but-its the
jekri tribe up there theyre an ugly bunch to
deal with
  he gets into a small launch or canoe and goes off
with blacks whom he can not talk to into a strange
world of dense forests and glassy waters-strange
vegetation strange animals strange skies he has
long unfilled hours in which to brood himself into
funkitis eventually he arrives at the trading-
station which is probably a rat-infested blackened
and ancient hulk moored to the jungle the exile
there is pitifully relieved to sec him docs not try
to disguise the fact that to go home is to go from
hell to heaven and with a view of putting him
next morbidly paints the treachery of the natives
the deadliness of the rainy season the awfulness
of the loneliness the insidious peculiarities and
varieties of fever
  are you well-stocked in quinine youd better
see that your nigger tastes your chow bt-fore you
eat not that that is much of a safeguard for hell
poison you himself if he takes a fancy to the pants
youre wearing theres an interpreter here youll
have to watch pretty close dont present your
back to him he carries a knife in his loin-cloth
and is a member of a secret society among the
blacks that is set on ridding the country of us
whites youve got to be mighty careful too
not to offend their ju-ju superstitions did you
bring a deck of cards if it hadnt been for solitaire
id have gone crazy to know how to kill time the
white ants ate up my grips dye want to sell
me your kit-bag ten-to-one you wont have any
use for it this station is the rottenest on the
niger
  next day the young man finds himself a lone
white in a hostile world right there he starts
marking off the calendar and counting the days
to his relief and estimating his chances of living to
see it in a word he has funkitis

so i understand it is now called
then it was lands end-tliat
pretty little precipice behind
cragcastle where the rock falls
sheer a hundred feet to the usually turbulent
inlet it lay at the narrow end of break-
neck gorge the upper end of which em-
braced the isolated freak of a house known
as cragcastle
  lawyer osborne had told me his recently
deceased client john maxon had built
the house and in truth its remoteness
matched well with that eccentric provision
in his will which had caused me a stranger
to everybody concerned to take up a soli-
tary residence in cragcastle and which
as a consequence gave me the novel expe-
rience on the first night of my stay there
of sitting across the table from a visitor
whom i had just admitted and of whom
i knew absolutely nothing-except that he
intended to kill me
  as soon as i read of your fathers will
said this stranger i knew i had you
  he was and was not a man of pre-
possessing appearance superficially he
was handsome-well-formed well-dressed
in the late forties with quite regular fea-
tures a closer look however showed
that he had a coldly sensual mouth and a
brutal jaw and that liis eyes were bloodshot
crookdom and the underworld know such
faces well they are the natural result of
years of vice and vicious profiteering
working upon unusual intelligence as a
basis in my own person i should probably
never have known this man well enough to
have had him for an enemy
  your father probably figured he went
on that if you were a coward you
wouldnt come back and if you changed
into a man of passable courage fit to be
his son you would that was where he
made a mistake you came back and
still youre a coward li fact you came
back because youre a coward the money
you stole was all gone of course and you
figured i was probably dead or gone or
broken mentally-which last i might well
bt-and youd rather take a chance ou
facing me than a certainty of beach-
combing it the rest of your life a hundred
thousand is worth taking a chance for-
and even worth living in this mansion a
year for though mainly- his eyes flitted
around the bare room-it isnt fit to house
ghosts in and i hope yours will be-un-
comfortable
  herein liis animosity caused him to
exaggerate true the room in which
we sat contained little else than our two
chairs and the old oak table on which he
had ordered me-somewhat to my amuse-
ment-to keep my hands but that was
because id carefully denuded it of every-
thing else-sofas chairs and the like-
before he came in even while he urged
the masquerade on me osborne had very
earnestly warned me against personal
danger and i wanted to make quite sure
that if i had a caller we should sit where
we did
  really cragcastle was a fine rambling-
or rather climbing-old country house
quite comfortably supplied even to a tele-
phone and electric light and heat

rogues end

  but i suppose hardridge as my visitor
had named himself referred mainly to its
isolation perched as it was five hundred
yards up the seaward slope of mount
tamalpais five miles from the nearest
village and four from the nearest house
  i replied that he was hard to please
since the setting couldnt be beaten for a
murder
  and indeed hardridge seemed outwardly
to have every chance of accomplishing his
intention we both believed we were
alone in the house he had also made
certain that i carried no weapon and ire
himself held an effective-looking revolver
in a clearly efficient hand but he rested
that hand on the table with the gun pointed
only in my general direction so i could
have concluded the scene at any moment
however i didnt want to check him yet
there being too much i wanted to know to
let slip a chance for knowledge
  on his part up to now hardridge had
been enjoying himself perfectly well in
gloating over my supposed helplessness
assassins are usually rhetoricians as well-
which fact has saved many lives
  however i added ill probably be
as comiortable as you dead or alive for
of course therell be no doubt as to who
killed me in fact osborne warned me
against you before i came over hes the
executor you know youll either hang
or go to san quentin-
  at that last word hardridges face went
livid his revolver flashed up and for an
instant i thought we were both dead men
  - you he cried-it was his first
touch of real passion-cut that dont
you dare-
  for a longer term than i caused you
to get last time i went on steadily
thatll be some consolation to my ghost
few men will fire in the middle of
another mans sentence that was one
reason i completed mine but there was
another reason too his outburst par-
tially confirmed a suspicion certain of his
remarks and certain things in his appearance
had given me-that he had been in prison
and believed i had sent him there and i
wanted to prove or disprove it
  you see i hadnt yet learned why he
wanted to kill me
  you think so he rasped lowering his
revolver well youll not have that
comfort those of the ring that are left
are back of me in this and theyll see me
through because youre a traitor doesnt
prove all men are because i trusted you
doesnt prove im altogether a fool either
my getaway is safe and ive money too
plenty of it my pro rain in that pool you
stole didnt break me bv a long shot
though it did break most of the others
no john maxon its not prison but life
thats ahead of me-life he exulted
and for you dealh and the fishes for
ill drop you into the bay i wouldnt
poison the earth with you pah nothing
but poisonous toadstools could come irom
your carcass
  its not easy to hear oneself reviled so
and make no defense but i could hardly
have opened my mouth without betraying
that i wasnt the man he thought me
wliat i had gotten from hardridge so far
was not as much knowledge as food for
conjecture as for the smooth-talking
lawyer osborne whod drawn me into the
affair and got me to come to cragcastle
hed really said nothing about hardridge
but only warned me against danger in
general
  anyway i placed little confidence in
anyuiing osborne had told me his ap-
pearance of candor had been too perfect
to be genuine ive learned to beware of
the confessed rascal who looks me straight
in the eye-theres always some other
deviltry hidden behind his confession
this i was sure was osbornes case
although the will itself-john maxon
srs disposing of cragcastle and the rest oi
the maxon estate-was evidently genuine
  osborne had calmly proposed to me a
stranger a plan involving false impersona-
tion perjury theft and perhaps a few
other violations of the law profit about
fifty thousand each i couldnt pick out
the unsound spots in his proposal except
that he wasnt a man wrho would be content
to divide such profits evenly naturally
i wanted to see what was behind his
proposal and a week must necessarily
elapse before i could sail on my own busi-
ness so i came in with him
  i came the more readily since i knew
i really needed some amusment to take
my mind off the absorbing problem into
which i would presently plunge it can
hardly be hinted at in the present con-
nection but if you remember that throne-
shattering society the ko lao hui the

adventure
part it played in die chinese revolution
and the part it would have played had its
monstrous leader koshinga lived then
youll know what it meant when the word
was passed to a few of us that koshinga
had not died or rather that a eertain
man had arisen in china who claimed to
be koshinga china has been my hobby
for years-anti in face of this rumor i was
chained to san francisco for a week
  but to return within twenty-four hours
after meeting osborne i took up my solitary
residence in cragcastle which was the
peculiar punishment test or merely eccen-
tric requirement imposed by the senior
maxons will upon his only son and heir
at ten oclock of my first evening there
osbornes warning of immediate danger
had been substantiated in answer to a
knock  had opened the door and hard-
ridge had thrust his revolver against my
chest
  to his desire to punish before killing to
view my writhing soul as weli as my writh-
ing body i probably owed my life but
id disappointed him in the first respect
and i felt he would soon seek the ultimate
satisfaction
  youre far from complimentary i said
crook coward traitor-well maybe im
all three -but you havent yet accused
me of being a fool and a fool id certainly
be if i came and played with death in this
house without seeing to my cards and
would a coward sit in such a game quite as
calmly as im sitting unless he was suie
he held the winning hand
  i could tell by the violence of his re-
joinder that these two questions had been
troubling him all along
  a cur like you- he began
  i didnt feel like enduring any more
so i raised my right hand that had never
shifted from its first position on the table
a short three inches the movement-
caught his attention and his eyes shifted
to the taut string that extended downward
from my closed hand and disappeared
through a hole in the top of the table
and the sentence he had begun
died on his lips it was inter-
esdng to note how like a weakening
shadow uncertainty flitted over his face
theres no threat so unnerving as a mys-
tery
  i smiled
  puzzling isnt it if i were to lower
the top-so-and curve it-so-it forms a
question-mark well ill answer the
question  pulled the string taut again
and caught his eyes and held them the
other end of the string- i measured
my words-is tied to the trigger of an
automatic the muzzle is about two
inches from your vest you may feel of it
if you like
  oh i added swiftly as almost brainless
rage hashed into his eyes youd be willing
to die killing me of course but you cant
ive made sure of that i can riddle you
with bullets before you can get your re-
volver up and the shock of the first one
will destroy your aim thats right sit
still- there- as his left hand stole
under the edge of the table-touch it
lightly for your healths sake you see
now put your hand on the table again
and shove your revolver across the table
with your finger-dps butt forward
  dont be foolish i said reasonably
as he hesitated dont you understand
im going to let you go and give you another
chance for murder and myself another
chance for entertainment
  dont tell me that rasped hardridge
roughly but obeying me nevertheless
whats your game why dont you
end it
  of course i was playing the part of
john maxon jr badly-that is judg-
ing from hardndges conception of that
gentleman but to act as hardridge sug-
gested might involve unpleasant conse-
quences being myself without the law
then too hardridge was the only possible
open sesame i knew of to the mystery of
osbornes real motive in persuading me
into my present masquerade
  we all change with the years i said
carelessly you mav leave when vou
like
  i picked his revolver up glanced at it
leveled it at him and arose
  but next time- i hinted
  next time he grated harshly you
get no chance for monkey-shines
  thanks i said good night
  he got to his feet slowly and turned away
slowly glaring at me the while and plainly
loath to go the fury that was in his eyes
the fixed hatred that smoldered behind
it told me what a dangerous enemy i was
loosing and no wonder for it was i
rogues end

according to his evident belief who had
wreaked havoc upon his life and con-
demned him to years of solitary brooding
in a prison cell
  i recalled with an inward grimace how
osborne had shaken hands with me that
morning and wished me well knowing
as he must have known that i was marked
for the vengeance of this man what
chance had he really-felt there was that he
would ever see me again or had it really
been his belief-and possibly his hope-
that id kill hardridge instead every
thread of the tangle went back to the
central mystery of osbornes purpose in
the matter
  i remembered that i had had to give
some proof of my ability to take care of
myself in a pinch before osborne would
open negotiations with me at all surely
that indicated no desire to furnish hard-
ridge with a victim
  mystified as i was however i think i did
not permit hardridge to guess it and it
was with an intent to carry the tiling off
lightly that i said to liim-
  i suppose youll haunt the house like a
specter and all that sort of thing
  by - you know i will he shot
viciously over his shoulder
  letting him go was really taking a little
flyer in death limited and i knew it
  then happened the second peculiar thing
of the night just as hardridge put out
his hand to open the door in the silence
following the cessation of our footsteps
i heard unmistakably the sound of some
one else moving in the house
  it was difficult to believe for early in
the afternoon i had carefully barred all
doors and windows it could hardly be
an accomplice of hartridge but to cover
the sound from him i asked him if he had
another gun and ran my hand over his
pockets his snarl at my touch was like a
wild beasts
  then you may need this one i said
as i pushed him out into the night
  and as i closed the door upon him
i	flung his revolver after him the act
was i think based upon sound strategic
principles it would be very easy for him to
get another gun but very difficult to forget
my carelessness as to whether he had one
  but the moment the key was turned in
the lock i wiiirled and darted across the
room the inner door of the room opened
into a hall that ran the length of the house
i passed through that door and was about
to cross the hall into the parlor opposite
when another sound decided me i ran
down the hall and through the first door
to the left into the library which adjoined
the parlor to the rear after fumbling for
a moment for the electric light switch
i finally found it
  id been prepared for strange things when
i came to cragcastle indeed the remote-
ness and solitude of its setting surrounded
by miles of black rock and chaparral-
covered mountainside save to the east
where the water eternally beat and lapped
against its foundations gave the house an
appearance of being fashioned for mystery
and framed in it and my interview with
hardridge had been sufficiently remarkable
to have prepared me for almost anything
nevertheless i admit my credulity was
staggered then
  a womans figure flashed through the
doorway that led back into the parlor
the door slammed shut behind her
  it was in no gentle mood that i pursued
her remember to me she was at best a
housebreaker and i suppose my nerves
were somewhat tense and jumpy too
she got into the hall before i caught her arm
in a grip that must have hurt and im
afraid it was with scant courtesy that i
drew her back into the parlor
  but once there and the tights turned on
i like to remember i released her quickly
  i beg your pardon miss i said
ii
its been a saving principle of mine
to apply as little thought as possible
to feminine beauty this from
i hope no innate lack of appreciation in
me-but ill omit self-analysis and simplv
say that it was something more than beauty
that made me instinctively apologize to the
intruder character was stamped on her
sensitive yet sanely strong and sensible
face whatever the reason for her presence
in cragcastle it could not be a guilty
one and suddenly i felt guilty under the
blazing wrath of her clear blue eyes as
for the unveiled contempt in them it was
as hard to endure as it was for a moment
to understand
  but when she spoke i understood it-
at least in part
o
adventure
  well cousin john with icy bitterness
what are you going to do
  she too like hardridge had imme-
diately accepted me in my assumed char-
acter of john maxon that was quite
natural for who else would be occupying
cragcastle but to be addressed by her
as cousin was somewhat different the
late john maxon jr had according
to osborne no near relatives at all that
had been one of osbornes best arguments
why i might in safety and with no great
moral guilt lake his place if it had been
a lie osborne must have known i would
very shortly discover it i suppose my
stare at the girl must have been quite
idiotic
  have you come back witless as well as
everything else she asked sharply cant
you speak
  i could see that under the surface she
was really frightened she was trying the
old device of simulating-and perhaps
stimulating-courage by hard words
  im naturally astonished i said
what are you doing here
  merely paying a cousinly call of
course she laughed mirthlessly
  i think youd better answer me i told
her quietly this is my house its nearly
midnight youve evidently gained entrance
by steal til in other words youre in the
position of a common burglar the fact
that youre my cousin will not prevent
me from turning you over to the police
  i suppose not the tarred stick would
blacken the whole branch the family
name-
  you should have thought of that before
breaking into my house it was a rare
part for me playing the stem landlord
  im not begging she replied tartly
do what you will of course you know
what im doing here theres only one
thing worth coming for-and that by
rights belongs to me anyway or rather
to my father if your father hadnt
stolen it--
  what do you mean dont say that
he did and you know it it belonged
to father it was willed to him-all he
got out of the estate-because he was the
eldest son its always been so and grand-
father wouldnt break the chain even for
your fathers lies then it disappeared
who could have taken it except the man
who got everything else who had every
opportunity-your father why didnt
he tell fa tier he had it-gloat over it-
and that it would never be discovered save
by his son you
   was getting quite beyond my depth
one thing was clear however  was
relieved of all obligation toward lawyer
osborne by his multiplied falsehoods
he had discredited once more the prettv
bedraggled saying honor among thieves
moreover it seemed likely i might progress
faster in solving the riddle if i doffed my
mask before this girl-in whose presence
i admit the wearing of it had become
rather odious	-
  why no i said i must admit all
thats a riddle to me because you see
im not your cousin	
  not my-cousin
  in her bewilderment and increased fear
she retreated a step her hand going up as
if to ward me off
  merely an imposter i told her as
gently as i could but i assure you
a perfectly harmless one your cousin
being dead  planned to take his place-
for a day or so and-
  in the middle of my stumbling half-
explanation i observed incredulity come
into her face part of which i flattered
myself was caused by a new and swift
appraisal of me
  but thats impossible she interrupted
thank you i said but its unfor-
tunately true
  but how- i dont understand oh
it isnt possible
  neither could i understand why her
credulity had passed so swiftly into absolute
disbelief her only question now seemed
to be as to my motive in denying myself
  it was unpleasant im not accustomed
to having my word doubted and i par-
ticularly wanted to be believed by this girl
so i told her as convincingly as possible
and in as few words the whole story of mv
presence in cragcastle
  id really been brought into touch with
lawyer osborne through a want ad
obviously designed to attract every near-
respectable world tramp in san francisco
between certain age weight and height
limits osborne had quizzed me until he
discovered that i had no acquaintances
within a thousand miles and that i appar-
ently matched his misuse of the law
with a profound contempt for it-which
rogues end

incidentally was his error then hed told
me that one of his clients john maxon
had just died that his son and only heir
john maxon jr had been killed about
the same time in a saloon brawl in hong
kong that this son had been absent
about five years a neer-do-well wanderer
much of the time under assumed names
that in feature and stature i bore a very
strong resemblance to him and that only
he osborne knew of this sons death
  osbornes proposal was of course that
i substitute for this dead son which i
might do the more easily since a freak
provision in old man maxons will provided
that his son live alone in cragcastle six
months before inheriting this evidently
because he had fled from some danger and
his father wished to test his courage and
worthiness-but of this osborne knew
nothing at the end of six months my
identity as john maxon would be easily
established-to osbornes satisfaction at
least-and osborne and i would split the
estate
      while i was telling her this the
girls expression gradually changed
from incredulity to utter amaze-
ment and she apparently had hard work
to keep from interrupting me at the end
after hesitating a moment she confounded
me and upset my whole tale by four as-
tounding words-
  but john isnt dead
  what
  the girls confidence came slowly but
after all i had given her mine and frank-
ness begets frankness finally after ap-
parently considering the matter she went
on
  no at least he sailed from china
alive osborne himself showed me his
cable at date of sailing then i have a
letter he wrote a few days before-a very
brief business letter we werent friends
his ship reached san francisco last satur-
day
  then osborne lied all around i said
slowly after all i sensed it but in
the name of reason why
  it appeared like a stiff enough problem
but i was more than ever glad id come to
cragcastle
  the girl continued to regard me ap-
praisingly cautiously but i seemed to
have leaped several points in her estimation
from legal cousin to illegal imposter-
as strong a commentary- as id yet had on
john maxons character nevertheless i
still considered her apparent lack of fear
as largely brave subterfuge and i tried
hard to reassure her we were both
searchers-i for the truth she for some-
thing materially valuable-and if i could
win her confidence there might be a chance
of mutual help
  i want you to believe i told her
earnestly and truthfully that i didnt
intend to go through with the thing
curiosity isnt wholly a feminine vice
miss maxon i knew osborne was lying
and i wanted to see what was really in his
mind and he never said a word about
you according to him john maxon
was the only heir i thought id step
into the affair without troubling any one
and get out the same way if id really
intended to stick would i have confessed
my masquerade to you as quickly as i did
  i still think that last was a logical argu-
ment and it was to that i returned several
times during the five minutes talk that
followed but perhaps the reason miss
maxon finally permitted herself to believe
me was that she wanted to perhaps she
had all the time held the idea of enlisting
me in her own search but when i finally
brought the talk around to it again she
refused to discuss it
  no she said it doesnt matter
i shouldnt have come anyhow oh i must
go now
  and she made a hurried move as if to
escape into the night
  at that i suddenly remembered that
death watched cragcastle that night and
though i stood squarely in her path i
refused to stir
  wait i said earnestly ive some-
thing else to tell you something for your
own safety tell me first when and how
you came here and how you got into the
house
  why i walked out from the village-
mill valiev i mean-this morning i had
a bundle of old keys and finally got the
front door open i was here when you
came we had a fine game of hide-and-
seek though you didnt know it i thought
id escape discovery till you went to sleep
and then leave
  after searching a little more i suppose
i supplied well you came out of your
 
adventure
hiding-place to see if id settled down
and- did you hear voices just before
i caught you
  yes
  and then  told her of my interview
with hardridge and tried to make it clear
to her that it would be difficult to leave
cragcastle that night without stopping a
bullet i argued the more convincingly
because even then in a nebulous way the
plan i later acted on was forming in my
mind
  but to put it through i must win miss
maxons confidence completely
  my exact arguments dont matter and
anyway the personal element figures mainly
in matters of this kind any one would
find it hard to tell me why she should not
have stayed in the house and she ad-
mitted at last that no one would be
concerned about her whereabouts she
was teaching in san bernardino had come
north during the few days of vacation and
was merely registered at one of the san
francisco hotels
  after that she quite readily told me
the object of her search in cragcastle
id already divined that it was family
jewelry she centered the search to a single
sapphire-a sapphire that had come down
in the maxon family for many generations
always from telder son to elder son until
john maxon sr had broken the chain
he was the younger of two brothers and the
favorite with their father indeed be-
tween the other son and their parent had
come a wide estrangement-the girl gave
me to understand that it was through some
machination on the part of john maxon
anyway all the family estate had been
willed to john maxon except only the
famous sapphire-and that had disap-
peared
  and miss maxon was sure her uncle
john maxon had stolen it and being un-
willing to dispose of it and unable to display
it had kept it hidden all these years she
said he had even boasted of the theft to
her father and she was sure it was still
in cragcastle where he had suddenly and
unexpectedly died
  was it it seemed a fantastic tale but
not an incredible one a great gem and
family strife-how related are the two
ideas and i had - considering the
proverb like father like son-no reason
to think over highly of the paternal an-
cestor of john maxon jr he might
easil be a man who would steal for spite
and gloat over his stealings in secret of
all forms of wealth jewels lend themselves
most easily to this form of vice-as witness
history truly the love of jewels-but
 suppose my belief in esther maxons
story was very largely based on my real
desire to help her
  please dont think that-that its for
myself but my fathers quite ill-has
been for years hes never had-proper
care  dont make enough as a teacher
and if we could get the sapphire and sell
it-
    get it for you i said or  think
i can
  for her tale of the sapphire had given
me the second half of the idea i needed
 oh how
  not by searching we might search
a year and never find it your uncle had
a good many years to contrive a hiding-
place but if its in this house i think
i can get it ill try anyway
  i wasnt too sure but if my mental
laborings had borne true fruit-if id
judged accurately the character of the
suddenly resurrected john maxon and his
motive in having osborne inveigle me into
impersonating him at cragcastle-then we
had a chance
  for of course if john maxon were alive
he was the principal osborne only the
agent i thought it quite clear too why
he should temporarily desire an understudy
in the play called life in short i simply
took for granted the truth of hardridge s
description of him thought what such a
man would do in such a case as he had
found himself on reading his fathers will-
and in such and such another case-and
mapped my moves accordingly
  without telling her any tiling of my plan
i finally got miss maxon to retire for the
night indeed she was very tired there
were bedrooms in the second story of the
house and  led her to one that had strong
shutters over the window and confidence-
inspiring bolts
  then i went to the cellar got twenty
feet of light rope and passed through the
house again to the front door taking
my revolver in my hand i opened the door
and darted through it hastily i turned
the key in the lock then i leaped away
from the door and across the roadway
rogues end

  into a narrow trail that led through
  the chaparral down the mountainside
  throughout i made it appear that i was
  rather clumsily and nervously trying to
  escape unseen
     of course my intention was precisely
   the opposite
     i assumed that hardridge would be as
   easily fooled in such matters as the average
   city-bred man
ill
        it was a quite dark night a
  js low thin mist had drifted up from
  the sea and through it the light
  of the stars and of a ghostly hall-moon
  filtered uncertainly from the beginning
  of the trail i looked back a scant twenty
  yards to the house and saw only a bulky
  gray shadow besides that and the near-by
  chaparral i could see nothing the light
  of the string of villages from the foot of
  tamalpais to the ferry passage the inter-
  mittent flash of alcatraz and even the
  white radiance that san francisco usually
  flings against the sky were all blotted out
  by the mist
    so although i knew that humanity
  society and the law were all very close at
  hand it didnt seem so strange that i should
  be crouching primitively in the edge of the
  brush my nerves strung up straining my
  senses for a sign of hardridge
    which wasnt long coming the
  chaparral crackled to my right a cautious
  foot planted itself on the roadway-i
  judged about thirty paces lower down
  there were more footsteps hardridge
  came closer just when by craning my
  neck out of the brush i could see him
  outlined shadowily i made a slight noise
  with my foot instantly a revolver
  cracked and the bullet hit the road a
  little beyond me
    and instantly i had turned and was
  moving cautiously-yet not so cautiously
  that hardridge could not hear my move-
  ments-down the trail
hardridge of course started in pursuit
as i had intended and-ostensibly hunted
really hunter-i quickened my flight i
made only enough noise so that the sound
 of my movements would come to hard-
 ridges ears above the noise of his own
f which was really considerable hard-
ridges pursuit at once freighted by excess
of caution and hurried by hate was so
laughably awkward that i knew-barring
accidents-id be able to accomplish at
least the first item of my plan
  the trail here descended sharply on
both sides the shrubbery was as thick
as an abandoned vineyard here and
there low chaparral thrust arresting thorn-
tipped branches across the trail and tore
at my flesh and clothing underfoot the
ground was uneven uncertain strewn with
small stones that were easily dislodged and
with dead leaves that crackled still i
was able in some way to control the sound
of my passage and to move with less and
less of noise every minute
  hardridge was now about twenty yards
behind me but he was rapidly lessening
the distance also he was rapidly lessen-
ing his caution probably the diminishing
sound of my flight excited him with the
thought that i was escaping now and
then i purposely broke a twig or brushed
a branch so hed know i was still in motion
once straightening up i thrust my head
above the chaparral he fired but i had
ducked out of sight again before his finger
jerked the trigger i intended the move-
ment to enrage him still further like a
mocking gesture
  the game was i suppose slightly unfair
for hardridge was blinded both by passion
and inexperience but he had brought it
on himself besides as things stood now
i was really working toward the end hard-
ridge himself desired at least i so
believed
  a little farther and my flight ended
the trail led straight on but to the right
a narrow opening between two clumps of
shrubbery attracted me i stopped oppo-
site that opening drew up my feet and
backed into it then i picked up a pebble
and tossed it down the trail it struck
the ground perhaps five yards beyond where
i lay and bounced and rolled a little
  hardridge probably believed as i in-
tended he should that the pebble had been
dislodged by my foot anyway he came
blindly  until i could have reached out
and touched him there he stopped as if
he had sensed my nearness and was men-
tally feeling for me if it hadnt been for
his labored breatiling he might have heard
me stir and set myself for the leap
  as it was the butt of my revolver crashed
against his forehead while he still stood

adventure
there-waiting it seemed for the blow
he reeled backward and i caught him and
twisted his arms behind his back he was
only partially stunned and he struggled
feebly while i tied his wrists together
  maxon - you maxon he mut-
tered and as full strength and con-
sciousness came to him with complete
realization of his helplessness the strength
of his expletives kept pace with his growing
rage nevertheless  could hardly dis-
agree with most of his expletives as applied
to die individual whose life id borrowed
so while i finished binding his arms securely
to his body  let him talk on then-
  why dont i kill you dien if im all
that i asked
  it was my intention to give him a doubt
to start on if id flatly denied being john
maxon hardridge would hardly have be-
lieved me besides it wasnt in the game
but it was in the game that he be made
to regard that possibility-as a possibility
  whyr didnt i kill you a few hours ago
or a few minutes or any time between
i couldve you know as easily as i could
kill you now of course you realize that
youre really as helpless out here as an
infant
  cut that you-
  it is unpleasant to see a man fairly sob
with rage i suppose part of that rage
was at himself for being so easily trapped
and mastered
  im going to gag you i went on when
hed quite finished take you back to die
house and lock you in a closet there
youll stay all day youll be regularly
fed i want you to keep up your strength
in fact ive a particular reason for wanting
it in the evening youll be unbound and
die gag removed but youll be still kept
in die closet-and be sure the door of it will
be covered by my gun you should know
by this time that i dont make mistakes
now why do you suppose im doing all
that
  how the devil should i know i sup-
pose youre calling in your friends the
police
  try again i said i neednt go to
all that trouble to get the police but
fra merely suggesting that maybe you
havent quite plumbed this thing yet
put your diink-tank to work and try to
figure things out youll have lots of time
in that closet
  he emitted a sound between a curse and
a groan i think he was looking forward
into those black hours when hed be alone
with his hatred balked bound and help-
less
  you d better kill me now john maxon
ne said
  john maxon probably would i replied
  and then i dapped on the gag giving
him that besides a new thought to chew on
it was perhaps the impact of that new
thought on his brain that made him quite
easy to manage on thejvay back to crag-
casde
  i put him into the hall closet which was
built into the wall between the doors of
the dining-room and reception-room it
was small enough that he w-ould have
practically no liberty of movement even if
he got free from the rope the door was
strong and i could figure no chance of his
escape nevertheless i placed a barricade
of furniture against the wall then i went
to the telephone
  the wires of which-think of it-hard-
ridge had omitted to cut ive often won-
dered of dunderwittedness and crime
which is the cause and which the effect
hardridge had been as i was to learn next
day among the higher-ups of crimedom
but even he neglected so obvious a thing
as the cutting of a telephone wire
mof course id provided myself
with osbornes home as well as
office address and bv employing
the ancient but usually effective catch
phrase matter of life or death i finally
got a sleepy somebody to promise to call
him i admit that aside from the fact
that the hour was a suitable one for the
message i had for him there was something
satisfying in the idea of dragging the com-
fort-loving lawyer from his bed at two in
the morning
  hello hello yes this is osborne
what is it
  i hardly recognized the voice whose
suave tones had drawn me into this ad-
venture irritable as it was there was
clearly a touch of nervous dread in it too
that nervous dread the jerky frightened
notes of my own voice were by no means
intended to allay
  this is part- no no i mean its
maxon thats it john maxon are
you alone
rogues end

  it was interesting to notice how the
alchemy of imagination and an evil con-
science transmuted my make-believe agi-
tation into real panic at the other end of the
wire osbornes voice when it came again
fairly shook
  yes practically that is i dont
think- wait a minute  think he
closed a door now but be careful over
the phone what lias happened
nothing that is- well im leav-
ing thats all i cant go through with it
thats au good-
  here wait a minute osborne cried in
alarm dont hang up wait a minute
where are you
  in cragcastle where you sent me
i said nervously and half angrily
  well- has any tiling- whats hap-
pened
  nothing i told you-nothing
  but something has it mustve or
you wouldnt- youre right to be careful
but i must know for your sake-pro-
tection as well as- listen ill ask ques-
tions i warned you of danger you re-
member
  yes
  well did it materialize
  yes
  ah osbornes voice dropped a key
is it-ended
  he pronounced the last word so signifi-
cantly that there was no mistaking the
meaning it was the lawyers safe way of
asking over the wire if hardridge was
dead
  yes i replied
  and thought i heard over the twenty
miles that separated us a quick sharp
breath of relief
  and-and im going i continued
itll be-discovered i had to-
  all right he interrupted me sharply
take care i quite understand you
had to- but i suppose youre quite
right-to go away well have to give up
the other project
  i thought he was almost too quick for
realism to put aside the hope we were both
supposed to have of dividing the maxon
estate but of course i was also sup-
posed to be quite unsuspicious that our
contract in regard to that estate was a
farce and that my function from the be-
ginning had been to kill or be killed by
hardridge
  im glad you agree well good-by
wait a minute tell me was it only
one was he alone
  yes
  have you any money
  i was waiting for that question i knew
hed ask it because both he and his principal
would certainly desire that i travel far and
speedily and id led him to believe i was
penniless
   i laughed in a self-satisfied a fashion as i
could manage and threw a touch of im-
pudent boasting into my tone
  plenty of it
  good said osborne somewhat per-
plexedly im glad of that but id
like to know- cant you tell me-
  im off i warned
  where it is he finished desperately
itll have to be disposed of you know
wherell i-whoever goes over-find it
it was clear of course that he spoke of
hardridges body-another inquiry that it
was quite inevitable he should make
  you might look i said with a sort of
boastful gibe near the place old man
maxon hid his sapphire
  whats that what do you know
about- the lawyers voice mounted
excitedly
  good-by
  i hung up the receiver
  a moment later the phone began ringing
furiously as if osborne had managed to
communicate to the inanimate instrument
something of his own agitation then
i cut the wire-as hardridge should have
done
  and i pulled a couch out of the parlor
placed it near the door behind which
hardridge was imprisoned lay down on it
and was soon asleep morning was only
a few hours off and i was quite confident
nothing would happen till then or in-
deed till the covering darkness of the follow-
ing night that is if i divined correctly
the nature of the man for whom i waited
  which was of course not osborne
osborne was strictly an office worker he
might be imagined playing any sort of
crooked game in the world-but through
intermediaries only his own physical
participation and his own personal peril
would always be missing elements no
the man who would come to see to the
safety of the maxon sapphire would be the
man who thought it his property-the

adventure
man who using osborne as agent had
attempted to bejfool me to his own place
under the damoelean sword
iv
looking back ive always felt
the day that followed was one of
the most remarkable of my life-
and i speak of the day not of the night
with its element of tragedy the day was
remarkable for its very lack of that element
-for its very unremarkableness i hold
that with such a night as had passed fresh
in our memories with hardridge impris-
oned with the arrival of the man whom
hardridge had vowed to kill presumably
impending and with the girls fortune and
possibly more than one life depending upon
the denouement it was no commonplace
thing that the day slipped by to miss
maxon and me much like a pleasant holi-
day outing
  for i finally persuaded her to stay until
the working out of my plan concerning
which by the way i told her as little as
possible its always much easier to agree
on an end than on the means and it doesnt
always pay to tell everything even to the
people in whose interest one may be
working
  we talked about a great many things
mainly impersonal and even took several
short walks one of those walks took us to
the place that was then called lands end
it was miss maxon who suggested it i
knew nothing until then of the trap-like
canon at the rear of the house with its
wide mouth and narrow exit upon the sea
but we had no sooner arrived at the railing
that guarded that exil where we could
look down some hundred feel into white
surf than miss maxon was seized with a
violent fit of trembling and suggested that
we return it was the only sign of real
agitation i saw in her that day
  that was late m the afternoon and the
last time we left the house
  breakfast and lunch had been largely
makeshifts but dinner that evening was
a triumph osborne having supplied the
house for my residence fairly well and miss
maxon proving herself a miraculous cook
after wed eaten i took his share of the
meal in to hardridge whom i found in a
state of eager expectancy he evidently
remembered my promise that hed be un-
bound at nightfall and i didnt disappoint
him instead of standing over him with
drawn revolver while he ate as id done
before i simply released his hands and left
him fumbling wildly but with stiff and
awkward fingers at his gag i wanted to
get away from him more lie could ask me
in words the eager question lhat had been
staring out of his overbright eves all day
  now dont be a fool i told him
through the closing door you cant
get out and you dont want to get out
and you dont want to make a noise be
quiet and youll lie-glad of it later
  and i bolted the door without locking it
and then pressed a button that projected
from tiie wall near the dxr jamb i heard
a pleased exclamation from hardridge as
the electric light came on within liis cell
thereafter he was silent but whether
because of my advice or because miss
maxon and i remained so close to the closet
that he could hear our occasional move-
ments i do not know
  for by then it was quite dark and after
another little preparation for what was
to come i joined miss maxon in the dining-
room the partition between this room
and the reception-room split the inner wall
of the closet and the house was so quiet
that we could sometimes hear hardridge
breathe we had turned on no lights save
that within the closet so from without
the place no doubt appeared absolutely
deserted
  everything was silent and dark in the
two hours that wte sat there i found time
to go over several times every incident
connected with my peculiar visit to crag-
castle my interest-desultory at first but
rapidly quickening-in the chronicle want
ad my carefully worded letter in answer
and osbornes skilfully alluring and yet
noncommittal reply our meeting-i sup-
pose i was one of some hundreds of appli-
cants most of whom were disposed of by
the oflice boy osbornes quick inspection
his clever cross-examination his devious
approach to the subject of the missing heir
our agreement and my arrival in mas-
querade at cragcastle my interview with
hardridge not wholly unexpected yet a
very curious one filled with much that
needed explanation my startling discov-
ery of the presence of the girl and her still
more startling revelations the conception
and partial working out of my plan the
rogues end

success of which hung on the next few
hours
  throughout i reflected i had been for-
tunate things had worked out very much
as i had planned and expected my first
motive in the affair had been almost com-
pletely satisfied only one question re-
mained unanswered-that of the cause of
hardridges hatred of john maxon there
remained my awakened desire to serve
miss maxon and in that i hoped that
fate-it is my egotistic conceit to some-
times regard myself as fates co-con-
spirator-would help me
  as for miss maxon she would have been
either more or less than the very natural
woman she was had she not felt fear in
those hours indeed she had no tangible
reason for placing confidence in me-
rather the reverse it was largely because
of that fact that i had urged her to stay
in cragcastle sometimes i thought it
was partly because of that fact that she
had stayed perhaps she wanted to be
on hand at the finding of the sapphire-
if it were found well my wish corre-
sponded if it were not found i wanted
her to know it and be sure of it
  i had in fact a remarkably strong desire
to stand well in the estimation of miss
maxon and i was meditating upon this
and also upon the problems connected
with the ko lao hui when we both heard
quick nervous steps coming up the gravel
path in front of the house i whispered a
wholly unnecessary warning to miss maxon
to keep quiet neither of us made a sound
but both were on our feet when the key
of the newcomer grated in the lock of the
front door
when-after the front door had
opened and closed again-the hall
lights were switched on by some
one who seemed perfectly familiar with
their surroundings i was standing just
within the dining-room door with miss
maxon perhaps a pace behind me as the
man for whom we had waited started down
the hall i heard the slightest stirring in
the closet which indicated that hard-
ridge was also alert
  the visitor however passed the door
of the closet without pausing and came on
unhesitatingly down the hall the parlor
and the reception-room he had already
passed there remained but two possible
objectives the library and the room wherein
miss maxon and i watched that he
should turn into the latter had been a
chance i had been compelled to take if
he did the adventure would be apt to end
speedily and crudely but great jewels
i had reasoned are not often concealed in
dining-rooms
  yet as the girl and i held our breaths
he passed our door too without a glance
at the obscurity beyond it
  though he could hardly have seen us
had he looked our way he was fully re-
vealed by the hall light the one look
i had of him was hardly reassuring for the
success of the game i had in mind if we
had ever looked alike then i owed it to my
self-respect to believe that maxon had
changed greatly but indeed i suppose
he had for life stamps every face with
lifes own mark and maxons face had
become a danger signal of vice and coward-
ice now i was -very glad i hadnt worn
my borrowed identity long
  there was now only one door into which
maxon could turn and he entered the
library across the hall without hesitation
like one sure of his objective i felt a
touch on my arm and looked around into
miss maxons eyes very close they
seemed to flash me at once a warning and
question and i shook my head reas-
suringly there wras no chance of maxons
passing out except by the front door to
a man of his temperament nothing could
be less attractive than the gloom and
desolation of the black rocks that flanked
the rear exit
  the sound of maxons movements had
ceased he had only been feeling for the
switch for now peering obliquely dowm
the hall i saw the library lights flash on
it seemed that he crossed the room there
was another moment of silence and then
a sort of rending scraping sound
  which sound was we afterward learned
the spring-impelled opening of a small
door in the library wall and the tearing of
the wall-paper that had been put on over it
behind which door was a small vault of
which i suppose only john maxon sr
had the knowledge and the key until he had
passed it on to his son
  maxon had the sapphire-i knew so
much from his low exclamation of relief
hardridge must have heard it too for he
stirred uneasily in his prison room miss

adventure
maxons breathing quickened while i-
well i held in ray hand almost literally
the key to the unexpected and ray egotism
was pleasantly stirred
  maxon came out of the library now with
a quickened movement and on tiptoe
he passed our door bent over fleeing
we heard something was it a bolt that
had been drawn john maxon stopped
short
  a door was flung iolentlv open it was
the door behind which hardridge up to a
scanty thirty seconds before had been
confined and instantly i stepped out into
the hall behind maxon in fact i stepped
out and hardridge burst out at the same
minute the effect was that we faced each
other in the well-lighted hall with maxon
midway between us
  hardridge looked-well to exaggerate
but slightly like a devils nightmare come
alive crouching for the spring for of
course he instantly thought of me whom
hed got into the habit of trying to kill
but he saw maxon in the hall instead
and then me over maxon s shoulder and
bewilderment flashed into his face and
matched his rage the doubt id tried
to suggest to him suddenly reinforced
checked his rush
  i had intended when id shaped mat ters
so far to put that doubt fairly in the form
of a question but john maxon himself
made it unnecessary had answered that
question before it was asked in a gesture
of self-betrayal he staggered back-
threw up his hands
  hardridge he croaked
  something in his right hand left a streak
of light behind it like a shooting star
  aijd hardridge arriving at the truth too
quickly for memory or logic recognizing
his enemy by a species of instinct would
have leaped in dreadful silence at maxons
throat but i jerked my revolver up and
covered them both
  one minute i said well maxon
yes im the man fra the man your tool
osborne picked to take your place here
keep back hardridge no therell be no
killing here-not till  find out what its all
about anyway
  speak up hardridge i ordered turn-
ing from maxons twitching features to
hard ridges inflamed and deadly face
what have you against this man
  that -- him exploded hardridge
that traitor and thief he stole the
money that would have saved me from
prison-me aud the rest of us that
coward and cur why blast you this
directly to maxon you knew that without
that money we were lost the-re-
formers-
  he has a license to talk he has
quavered maxon standing sidewise in die
hall alternately glancing apprehensively
at hardridge and beseechingly at me
  unhappy indeed was his situation his
only hope of life being in me whom hed
planned to dupe to the same death that now
threatened him
  who was he i asked maxon come
to the point quick
  he he was a dirtv gambling-house
keeper and dive-keeper and worse king
of crookdom through his pull in the city
hall and the money he savs i stole was
a slush fund to keep the politician crooks
in office because the other side won and
he went to san quentin where he belonged
he blamed me-
  you whining sneak cried hardridge
you were thick enough with us while the
going was good
  thatll do the pair of you i said i
quite understand
  i did well enough details were missing
but they were unessential these two
were part of the ring that had in the old
days debauched the city government of
san francisco to me that crime con-
stitutes one of the baser forms of treason
and i admit my linger twitched to shoot
them both
  then i thought of the sapphire id
formed no definite plan as to acquiring it
once john mason had taken it out of its
hiding-place circumstances must guide
me and-here were the circumstances
i suppose in a way i was re-
sponsible for what followed i sup-
pose that my apparent indecision
encouraged hardridge and i may even
have stepped a little to one side but i
know i didnt plan the thing or even
foresee it i did have a peculiar flashing
vision of that dark canon at the rear of
the house that dark canon with its smooth
steep narrowing sides and its floor dipping
ever more rapidly toward the jumping-off
place at the end
  anyway all of a sudden hardridge
rogues end

started for maxon maxon did the natural
thing for him he whirled and ran i could
hardly have stopped him if i had tried
he brushed me back against miss maxon
and half-way through the dining-room
door and hardridge tore after him without
a word
  there was a chair near the end of the wall
and maxon had sanity enough left to push
it before him through the window he
followed the chair head first and hardridge
plunged through the opening after him
  i was delayed a little in unlocking the
door i stepped out into a fantastic hollow
of ragged rocks flooded here at the ravines
beginning with moonlight there was a
narrow pass to the right but maxon had
missed that pass and he and hardridge
were leaping like shadows straight down
toward lands end
  maxon seemed to be straining to stop
perhaps he saw the railing and memory
came to him of what was beyond it but
his pace was so great and the grade was
so steep that he could not check himself
all at once and he brought up against the
railing with such force that it creaked and
sagged outward under the impact but it
still held
  and hardridge clutched him but by
the time i got close enough to see clearly
maxon had seized hardridges wrists and
was prying them outward and slowly
loosing hardridges grip on his throat
he wrenched hardridges hands away
and hardridge gripped him around the
body
  but maxon gripped him likewise and
began to bend hardridges body backward
  oh theyll be killed cant you-
oh
  miss maxon had come up frightened
sobbing she would have run up to them
and thus put herself in danger but i held
her back
  my dear miss maxon my dear miss
maxon
  there was nothing else i could say
  i turned and saw how very like an open
door was the end of the canon beyond
that door the sky sparkled with stars
and the waters beneath the stars reflected
their light but the water at the base
of the cliff must have been too unquiet to
reflect it i could hear it roaring as it
surged over the rocks and i imagined it
stretching up white and hungry fingers
  cant you stop them cried miss
maxon
  one more look i took at the place where
the two men had struggled then i
stepped between miss maxon and that
placfe and urged her gently back toward
cragcasue for hardridge knowing him-
self overmastered had suddenly yielded
and somehow dragged maxon with him
under the railing maxon gripped the edge
of the rock but hardridge tore his grip
relentlessly away and so there came an
end to the bad beginning made many years
before
  i reflected as i picked a w-ay up the
uneven canon bottom that the quivering
woman whom i led would probably some
day be mistress of cragcastle since her
father was now heir to the maxon fortune
in that case they could well afford the loss
of the sapphire
we parted at the base of the
mountain miss maxon and i it
was not late and we could go
different ways quite unnoticed into mill
valley and thence to san francisco if
the thing that had happened at cragcastle
were ever discovered there was no possi-
bility that shed be connected with it even
in thought while as for me   
  im sorry youre going back to china
she said n
  of course she would be for id told her
absolutely nothing of my errand there
unraveling the mystery of the ko lao hui
leadership if she had known w-hat was
ahead of me she would have been
glad my eagerness to be at it was to be
gratified
  you have been-well fine she said
  i murmured a few deprecating phrases
  and-wonderful ive been trying to
guess-how much of it all you had planned
out ahead the escape of hardridge for
instance
  well i questioned noncommittedlv
  you pretended it was accidental but
i found the string with which you pulled
back the bolt of the closet door that was
no accident
  maybe not i replied
  frankly it pleased me a little that she
had discovered it
  and then you knew-that father would
inherit-
  miss maxon i said theres no

adventure
pursuit so interesting as the pursuit of
motives and none as profitless
she laughed a little
to think she remarked that when
i think of you-as i shall quite often -  
always have to call you to myself just
that man 
 suppose it had seemed to her a curious
omission however names are so far acci-
dents that they seem to count for but
little in the scheme of things and ive
rather lost the habit of giving my true
name to every one i meet in passing

captain williams master of
the tramp psyche leaned upon
the rail of liis steamers bridge
looking at a mellow lovers
moon and swearing with melancholy
ardor while his chief officer from the
other side of the bridge regarded him
with a sort of disciplined disgust
  surely it was bad enough to sail on an
old biscuit-box like the psyche without
having a skipper who allowed his private
troubles to influence him more than he
lid the weather and always after supper
in the chiefs watch when a man was
having enough to do to digest the mis-
called food that their miserly owner silas
rutherford picked up in some gutter
did the old man come up on the bridge
and make things worse the chief officer
snorted loudly
  as if it were an answer to the inter-
pretation of that snort t he captain growled
you can go and take a smoke if you want
mister in such a way that any generosity
the permission might have contained was
wrung out of it like water from a swab
if he had said get to the devil out of
here and leave me to my troubles the
chief officer would live gone below with
the same thank you sir and told the
same lurid tale to the second engineer in
the starboard alleyway-a tale which even
a boccacio would find it necessary to
censor -
  but williams would not have cared very
much if he had overheard as a meed
of self-respect he might have thrashed his
chief officer but liis anger would have
been but superficial for a far deeper
wound was stinging him and the psyches
nearness to her home port newcastle-on-
tyne was sending up the temperature of
the sore
  he began to stump up and down the
bridge indifferent to a perfect summers
evening tomorrow night and the psyche
would lie in dock then would come the
usual two weeks of torturing desire of his
praying to the girl to marry him and of her
answer so galling to liis pride
  more money always more money
other men made more why couldnt he

and to his answer that silas rutherford
would not raise his salary and always
managed to cheat him out of his bonus
would come the irritating question-
  why dont you get another ship
  as if ships were so easy to get he
thought he had done very well to get
command at twenty-seven but the girl
was as blind to his merits as silas was to
his need of more salary and yet she kept
him hanging on pretending to love him
not that the captain realized the pretense
being his ideal liis divinity she was be-
yond such a thing and he loved her and
wanted her had the opportunity offered
he felt that he would turn pirate to win her
then he cursed himself for not being his
own boss for being dependent upon the
money of silas rutherford and his kind
  so taking it altogether he was an un-
pleasant commander and when he went
to his room shortly after eight bells the
third mate who had come on duty breathed
more relievedly
  while the psyche was pounding her way
to port her owner was reading a document
that had to do with her insurance as a
matter of fact old silas rutherford could
recite the wording of that policy but it
assisted his complex and criminal cogita-
tions to read and reread it while he planned
the old phrase handed down from genera-
tion to generation of marine underwriters
brought to him visions of delightful possi-
bilities now touching upon the perils
-such as- they wrere all there from
the act of god and the kings enemies
to all the chances of sea-disaster and silas
loved to dwell on them hoping his ships
would fall foul of one or all of them for
he greatly disliked paving premiums
  this was before the great killing put
the breath of life into old hulks when
freights were so low that dead ships paid
better than live ones when because of this
latter fact insurance policies were some-
times converted into cash by the unmoral
xand silas owned eight vessels that just
scraped into the a  classification by the
skin of their paint
  not that he could be accused of lack of
effort in regard to striving for profit even
when freights denied it-and captain
williams and the other captains and
officers in the ships of silas were not the
only people aware of his scraping his
name was a byword and his stinginess
something to refer to as the acme of human
meanness but silas cared nothing about
that
  indeed he probably enjoyed his reputa-
tion and went on serving out paint with
the care of a chemist serving attar of roses
while seeing to it that his crews tired of
fighting for life against the board of trade
allowance-weighed out to them by partisan
scales and dredged from the dusty corners
of condemned ship-chandlers stores de-
serted at the first port-with wages of
course unpaid and captain williams and
the other captains and officers as already
mentioned slaved on low salaries for a
bonus which always mysteriously eluded
them
  but even such careful business methods
failed to produce a dividend which
caused silas to take his insurance policies
out of the safe to yearn over them
  and the one he fondled most was the
policy that covered the ancient psyche
he had paid many premiums on that
promising piece of paper all of them clear
gain to the insurance company and by
exactly the amount of that premium had
the psyche been a dead loss to him for more
than a year surely the coincidence was
meant as a hint a deacon of his church
for more than forty years   
  he sat in his lonely dingy office the
warm breeze of the summer evening bring-
ing through the window the noise of
rattling winches on ships loading and dis-
charging in the near-by docks he usually
sat there until bedtime because he had no
friends and because to spend money on
amusement was an impossible vice to a man
who would rather have the money than
the amusement and he wasnt worth
more than a million pounds exclusive of
his exasperating investment in ships
  so for many evenings had he deliberated
over an untimely end for the psyche
neither did the idea leave him altogether
during the day but the one large obstacle
in the scheme was the need of an accom-
plice he would have to find a man
willing to undertake the sinking or burning
of the ship and that man would have to
be well-paid of course the captain was
the best man for the job but then the
captain would not only have more at stake
than an ordinary man but he would also
be more expensive
  he would be risking his certificate in

adventure
addition to taking the chance of going
to prison and he would know the value
of the insurance policy yet silas clung
to the notion of getting the captain to help
him if he could only get around wil-
liams in some way there must be a way
for every man has his weak side or else
there is something he wants so badly that
he will do anything to get it
so he reasoned yet when the
weakness of captain williams came
into the office next morning silas
nearly missed his opportunity
  she came early her good looks and pre-
tended embarrassment signaling for help-
which three clerks immediately attempted
to give her but silas prevented them
that is he happened to come into the office
at that moment and the clerks scurried
back to their desks as he brushed past the
girl on the way to his roofti-leaving her
standing in the middle of lhe floor appealing
to the universe with a studied pose the
clerks peered over their desks at her re-
markably like three scared mice peering
out of their holes at a tempting piece of
cheese which the proximity of the cat
prevented them from appropriating until
with a shrug she turned and walked boldly
into the private office astonishing silas
by asking sweedy when the psyche would
be in port
  how did you get in here he barked
  the girl pouted and indicated the door
with a gesture
  well what do you want
  when will the psyche come in
  what do you want to know for
  because-because captain williams is-
is a friend of mine
  a remarkable change came over silas
he became almost polite closing the door
and dragging a chair to the desk for the
lady
  sit down wont you so youre a friend
of the captains ch very lucky man
and he giggled in the senile way of men
unaccustomed to women
 yes-we-we-you see-
  she blushed with the acquired art of long
practise
  i do see-you are going to marrv him
eh
  perhaps she stiffened slightly
 ump 
  silas was thinking hard but the girl
believing him at the limit of his conver-
sational powers decided for reasons of
her own to help him
  it s the way ive been brought up
she hinted she had been brought up
in the unpleasant environment of a cheap
saloon-a tied house owned by a brew-
ery-of which her father had been the
ostensible proprietor ive had so many
good offers that the wages of a ship-captain
look kind of small but oh my what am
i saying-you must think im oreful
talking to a stranger this way
  not at all my dear silas found him-
self thinking he needed a new suit
  so she further elucidated i am
making him wail till he gets better off
greater luck can no man have than that
a woman will hare her fool soul to him
but the somewhat fascinated silas missed
the revelation seeing only a pretty girl
whose power over the captain of the psyche
could be used advantageously
you wont tell him i was here she
rattled on hes so jealous you know
she wondered wiiat it would be like to be
married to a man worth a million pounds
even if he were old
  no i wont tell him you were here
silas held her unresisting hand he had
never known a woman like her which was
perhaps unfortunate because there was
no memory she could revive to bring back
the taste of rotten fruit-which most men
have lipped and remember only with
feelings of the deepest shame he was
sorry when she left and she had shown
him that williams could be handled
later on he recollected that he had not
answered her question about the docking
of the psyche she was too good for
williams anyhow
  but the captain was an honest man
and silas was nervous about broaching the
subject he waited until the psyche had
been in port two days then in the
middle of business details he suddenly
remarked-
  hear youre going to get married
  the captain flushed but said nothing
girl want to wait till theres more money
in the bank suggested silas crudely
  something like that admitted wil-
liams gruffly his face showing how the
woman had fascinated him how he craved
her
  well- silas seemed to sneer-if i
touching the perils

wanted a girl and was a big strong young
fellow like you id do more than sit
around-id rob a bank before id let her
get away from me
  that would only get me in jail re-
torted williams
  silas laughed to hide his nervousness-
would you do it if you knew you
wouldnt get caught
id do anything growled the captain
but whats the good of talking about it
well silas hesitated then took the
plunge well i can show you a way to
make money
  williams was first astonished then he
was effusively grateful-
  if you do that mr rutherford ill
give my life for you any time
  dont want you to do that silas
got up walked to the door opened it sud-
denly saw that no one was listening and
went back to his desk dont want you
to do that he cackled at the surprized
captain
  he stopped talking-it was a difficult
job this even harder than he had expected
he wondered how williams would face the
board of trade investigation after the thing
was done lawyers have a way of making
sailors tell more than they want he had
seen em
  the fact is he managed after a few
minutes the fact is captain the psyche
has been a dead loss to me for some time
ive done my best sir
  yes yes i know you have but all
the same you know i can not be expected
to keep on taking losses im not in busi-
ness for the fun of it any more than you
are but while you get your pay every
voyage whether the ship makes a profit
or not i dont
  you arent thinking of laying her up
are you sir the captain was naturally
distressed at such a possibility
  may have to silas sighed unless
you can help me out
  me sir what would you suggest sir
i	can not see where i can cut down expenses
anywhere
  silas appeared to think deeply then
he went to the safe and brought back the
insurance policy
  i suppose that like every other captain
afloat youve often thought about the
insurance havent you
  yes and with the way things are ive
often felt like id like to make a profit for
you that way sir was the astounding
answer
  do you mean it silas almost shouted
why no of course not i was just
joking replied the somewhat shame-
faced williams you know just as you
said nearly every skipper thinks about the
insurance now and then-and wonders
well silas spoke very quietly now
i am not joking-not a bit of it things
have come to the place where i dont joke
about insurance see here help me to
realize on this and ill give you command
of my best ship with increase of pay and
five hundred pounds as well
  he had said it he had taken the leap
and now he watched the captain-who for
the moment was speechless-with some
apprehension
  what do you mean growled the cap-
tain want me to turn crook
  you know what you just said
  yes but that was in fun
is it fun about your wanting to
get married too silas grinned-
the captain had given him far less
trouble than he had expected if you
wont sink the psyche for me ill get a man
who will fire you and give you no reference
where would your marriage be then
where would it the unhappy sailor
could easily answer that question and
there was hardly a chance of being found
out wasnt she worth taking that chance
for
  suppose i tell the insurance com-
pany what you asked me to do he spoke
desperately
  ill have you arrested for criminal libel
and send you to prison you have no
witness you know but why be foolish
only you and me will know-and its my
ship anyway ill be hanged if i can
understand why you even hesitate-and
a fine young lady like that waiting for you
too and the money alls between you
williams said nothing every cell in his
great body craved the girl and when in
such a condition a mans morals are
smothered by very primitive emotions
and as he had said most sailors look upon
insurance from the owners standpoint
  just think urged silas youre char-
tered to a spanish port easy cargo to
fire open the sea-cocks to drown it

adventure
shell sink in no time youll be back
in a few weeks and then-your wedding-
day
  but th captain still fought feebly
  what about my ticket
  they wont touch it how can they
taint your fault if the cargo catches lire
the crew will only be too eager to get clear
youll probably be a hero for not losing
a man you know just where to start
things and afterward youll get my best
ship you know and yes ill let you take
your wife to sea with you chances are
that if you dont take this offer and get
some money shell marry some other man
and you know it
  williaras did know it and he remem-
bered vividly an unpleasant scene of the
previous evening when the lady had taunted
him about his lack of ability t make
money she wanted a diamond ring
which his scant savings made impossible
and here was five hundred pounds going
begging the job was easy enough and
in six weeks at the most he could be
married get a better ship with more pay
and take her to sea with him that last
pulled hardest
  what are the terms he asked gruffly
not looking at silas
  fifty pounds dowm and the balance
when the jobs done your pay increased
two pounds a month from today and
of course no lay-off when the psyche sinks
still the captain hesitated he loved
ships and felt not unlike a prospective
murderer indeed this sentiment weighed
more on the moral side than did the chance
of being found out but then silas old
scoundrel would get another man to do it
unless he did it and the girl   
williams got out of the chair
  ill let you know tomorrow he prom-
ised and went to see the lady
 he saw her what chance had his
scruples in her presence that had been
weak enough in the office of silas ruther-
ford for sailors are really myopic about
the rights of insurance companies then
their last parting still in his mind he
greeted her with-
  how would you like a fifty-pound
diamond ring
  you darling how did you do it
  i didnt say id got it i just asked
you how youd like one
  she moved away from him
  you know i want one do you think
it clever to talk that way its bad enough
to think of marrying a man too poor to
buy a girl what every other engaged girl
has without him making a joke about it
youd be ashamed if you had any and
a cloudburst settled the matter
  a little later after he had promised
to buy the ring next day she again asked
where he raised the money he told her
of his raise of pay the best ship permission
to take his wife-did she know who that
lady was-and invented a savings-account
of long duration to account for the ring
but if a man must sell his soul why not
for kisses for has any philosopher yet
proven them to be worth less than pieces
of silver
ii
      so a few wreeks later captain
williams wralked down the rocky
dog-smelly street of a tiny spanish
fishing village the stars looking at him from
a windy sky and his mouth gritty with
curses it was after midnight and but
for spasmodic barkings and the moan of
the flood tide the place was quiet and
sleep-suggesting but williams could not
sleep indeed he doubted if he would
ever sleep again for his thoughts were a
roaring cyclone that would not still so
he had left his bed in the smugglers retreat
of an inn and gone dowm to the shore
  and everything had looked so bright
things had gone just as he had planned
the psyche had caught fire in six places
and shortly afterward slipped to the bottom
of the sea without making much fuss
ten hours in the boats-williams had been
favored with a nice fair wind-and all
hands had been safely landed then the
news cabled to silas the captain had waited
for orders and congratulations wrhile he
arranged for the crew to be sent home
by the distressed seamans route
  by rights he should have gone with them
but his conscience had gathered to itself
all manner of intangible fears and he had
decided to wrait in the village then silas
had replied to the cable-by letter to save
money and with the letter from silas
had come another
  the old man had been abusive why
had the captain been so careless as to lose
a valuable ship and cargo this was to be
touching the perils

expected and williams had grinned at
what he imagined to be cunning and
while grinning did not trouble to finish
the letter instead he opened the other
which he was itching to read
  and the other letter had opened his eyes
broken his heart as he believed and shown
him that silas had meant what he had
written for silas had married the girl
who wrote saying she could never marry
a man who lost his ship who would never
get another ship and who hadnt a penny
to his name but she forgot to send the
ring that was all except that she loved
mr rutherford
  there was no word from silas about the
four hundred and fifty pounds he had prom-
ised to pay and nothing about the command
of his best steamer no just the curt
letter of abuse and the reminder that
williams would get no reference from him
and the illuminating scrawl from the
woman no wonder wrilliams could not
sleep but he would get even oh yes
he would show them but how to
write to the insurance company would be
foolish
  silas would have him arrested for libel-
the libel of a disappointed suitor-and the
company would arrest him for barratry
and what chance would his word have
against that of silas silas with a million
pounds to hire lawyers and williams
without-the girl had spoken at least
one true w-ord-a penny he even owed
the keepef of the cheap inn
  but williams saw nothing strange about
the wedding the womans cleverness
escaped him he was so infatuated with
her that it never occurred to him that
silas was an old fool who had fallen as
he himself had fallen for williams still
believed that any man would marry her
if she were willing and he thought silas
lucky to have thought otherwise would
have done away with the urge for revenge
that was all that mattered now-to get
even
  but when a few nights later the dirty
keeper of the inn shut the door in his face
about bedtime shrieking shrill abuse which
had to do with the payment of debt and
williams had no place to go but the beach-
the desire tor revenge had grown colder
immediate need had fogged its clarity
and kisses were of less wrorth than square
meals and warm beds but there were
neither beds meals nor kisses in sight
yet its shadow beckoning across the calm
moonlit sea was a small fishing-boat at
anchor and untenanted
  so shivering slightly the captain
stripped bundled his clothes on his head
and swimming high made his way to her
climbing on board he dressed wrapped
himself in the sail and after a time slept
no doubt the graybeards of that village
will tell for many years the legend about
the thief of an englishman who not
content with robbing the keeper of the inn
stole also a fishing-boat but like most
legends the tale will lack truth for
williams did not steal the boat on the
contrary the boat stole the captain
   that is while he slept it tugged uneasily
at its anchor until the grass rope doing
duty as a cable parted and williams still
sleeping was carried out to sea on the ebb
tide he awoke with the call to breakfast
but the call was but the echo of other
meals for there wasnt a crust on board
and the land was a mere haze and no
ships were in sight
  the tale of thirst and hunger has been
too often told to be here repeated be-
sides there is nothing pleasing about the
tale more pleasing to williams is the
fact that three days later he reached
gibraltar in the dark was mistaken for
a denizen of the place and met a shrewd
rock scorpion who had no ears for tales
but who gave him five pounds for the boat
which of course was worth much more
but five pounds to the captain was the
beginning of fortune once more he could
eat sleep and smoke and revenge still
called him but its voice was not so near
  it was obviously his duty both to him-
self and the underwriters to go back to
england for the board of trade investiga-
tion silas had been right when he had
said the captains certificate would not be
blackened but a guilty conscience saw
less clearly as it was he might find an
out-of-the-way owner who would not ask
questions-for the ticket and his previous
discharges were in his possession
   but gib was no place to find such owners
although it was an excellent place to get
word of them the five pounds melted
rapidly and w illiams had no desire to see
another door shut in his face about bed-
time when friendly fish-boats might not
beckon so kindly and once broke he

adventure
would be harried into some ships fore-
castle without chance of holding back
so one sunlit morning he went in search
of the rock scorpion and found him easily
  howdy the scorpion was affable
  williams replied in kind and began to
collect the memories having to do with
scorpions he had heard about their
many underground methods of doing busi-
ness and their supposed vast wealth the
rumors that they formed a sort of trust
which had a finger in all gibraltar business
had also come his way he knew that
while willing to buy a fishing-boat and
in league with the many smugglers in the
district it was no uncommon event to see
a scorpion bid for a steamer at auction
and pay fifty or sixty thousand pounds
cash when it was knocked down to him
  but whether the scorpions worked as a
league or as individuals was no concern
of williams because this shabby some-
what unclean english-language-mangling
mixture of a hundred different breeds was
obviously not only his star of hope but
also his last resort-excepting of course
some ships forecastle under a new name
  like to talk business with you
williams succeeded in making his voice
sound comfortably indifferent although back
in liis mind the final episode of the kid-
naping fish-boat loomed largely
  oh ha of course-we go to my horfice
they walked along the warm
dusty winding road until they
arrived at a sort of wine-shop with
the customary sign relating to the purity
and antiquity of the goods sold within
and the usual heavy population of flies
near the door a young spaniard made
querulous demand of a starved donkey
emphasizing his wishes with a stick but
the animal continued to study the sign
of the wine-shop as if he sought patiently
for some degree of truth and blows could
not penetrate to his absorbed mind they
passed inside where the apparent owner
slept comfortably quite indifferent to his
likeness to a fly-paper-waking into a
million smiles when the scorpion kicked
him
  this my home and horfice the scorpion
made some unnecessary remark into
the back room this son of ten thousand
thieves will bring us drink where we may
talk in peace eh
  the gentleman of the penitentiary family
increased the ratio of his smiling at the
reference to his ancestors produced two
not overly clean glasses and a bottle and
led the way into the back room-a dingy
place which however was gratefully cool
after the street
  what the business you have
  the preliminaries were over and the
scorpion made inquiry
  captain williams hesitated in the hard
curious eyes of the scorpion he saw the
answer to any request for a job the answer
to any asking for assistance-a sneering
nothing for you-and a sickening feeling
of failure was succeeded by a gust of anger
at himself for haing stooped so low and
then suddenly he felt himself in the
unusual position of being as it were
behind those eyes-of looking at himself
through the eyes of another man and
what he saw made him ashamed
  then he realized that all men who have
the courage to sail their own ships-the
men who do not depend on jobs-must
regard him as the scorpion would do the
moment he mentioned the business-
as a sort of weakling as a failure as one
of the sort that wants things arranged for
him much as a mule needs harnessing
before it can work yes he saw himses
as one lacking that something which causes
a man to struggle towrard an ideal heedless
of the mire he must go through-to inde-
pendence
  and then he asked himself why why
should he not be his own boss when this
wretched rock scorpion could be surely
he had as much intelligence the other
was not even a white man-was a mongrel
of a hundred mixtures yet he had made
something of himself better a burglar
than a beggar williams saw himself
almost cringing to this mongrel for a job
doing the rotten bidding of old silas a
slave to his lust for a woman-even this
in his moment of clarity did he see and
-for such things do actually happen-
in that moment williams became something
  just as a chemical solution remains a
mere grouping of molecules until the
addition of the needed constituent causes
precipitation so had williams lived in
the inchoate condition of the majority of
mankind-until this moment in the grimy
wine-shop what really happened he never
knew or troubled to know he felt his
touching the perils

mouth and chin stiffen to the latent power
in him that had found its motive and his
eyes now grimly smiling fought down
very easily those of the scorpion
  still there was no business that he knew
of but in his new condition such an ad-
mittance was unthinkable therefore he
fenced and luck was with his first
passage with the swords of business with
his lirst job as his own boss
  how many ships do you want he
asked carelessly rapidly deciding that
if the scorpion had bought ships once he
might buy them again and if nothing
came of his question he had saved his face
by the pretense of having something for
sale to his astonishment the scorpion
seemed startled most upset so many
words rushed for outlet that they jammed
in his throat like a panic-stricken crowd
trying to escape from a burning building
and this agitation grew rapidly
  who told you what you mean eh
have you just pretend you come in
fish-boat look like you broke not fair
that oh ha no not at all fair i think
you all the time were fooling yes i told
my wife that you ask her she say so
too now what the game eh
  williams laughed and continued to
laugh to give himself time to think why
should the scorpion be so excited even
supposing that he had some deal on that
had to do with the buying of ships-why
on earth should the mere mention of it
throw him into such a state of mingled
fear and anger things were so bad all
over the world that only an unprecedented
buying could send prices up-nothing
that the scorpion could be connected with
yet what was he afraid of
  well williams spoke quietly delight-
ing in the new feeling of power i had my
reasons for coming to gib in that old boat
and for selling her to you at far below
her proper price mavbe i hadnt been
quite so far out to sea as i looked he
paused wondering what the owner of the
boat had thought meaning to pay him
some day but you dont expect me to
tell you all that do you
  the scorpion rapped loudly on the table
cursed the lazy innkeeper when he appeared
and gave great orders about setting up-the
very best wine in the house in a hurry
he had a notion that hospitality greases
the ways
  we are friends no he professed
  if you like to put it that way-im not
particular wrilliams crushed down the
weakening memory of what he had been
an hour ago
  the wine arrived and williams was
amused at the ceremonious manner of the
scorpion it reminded him of something
whom had he seen drink that way
  but the wine did not loosen the tongue
of the scorpion although williams ques-
tioned him quite cleverly consequently
the captain was driven to invention he
had a fair knowledge of financial methods
even if most of it had been acquired in the
bucket-shops that had prevented his savings
from rising to diamond rings and he
understood something of the wrays of ship-
brokers that reference to ships seemed
to be trumps at any rate it was the
only card in his hand he decided to
play it
  now look here sylvester he began
to lie fluently what i have been doing
is all my business i took that boat just
as i always take what i happen to want
but what caused me to take her is also
my business now the two men who
i have had watching you-
  sylvester jumped out of his chair his
eyes popping for why had the captain
had him watched had they not always
been the best of friends if the captain
wanted more for the fish-boat he had
only to say so and the money would be
given him at once he knew they wrere
friends they had drunk much wine
together he had always loved the captain
and had heard of the great deeds of that
wonderful man the captains father before
him for why had he been watched as if
he wrere a thief
  with an effort williams put an end
to this unexpected but very satisfactory
outburst it was obvious that sylvester
was interested in ships queer though it
seemed and he knew the methods of
scorpions pretty well if this one were
buying ships-and he appeared to be-
he would buy them on options for
whether he were buying for himself or for
some asiatic who w-anted to become an
owner-which often happened-or buying
on speculation-whatever reason he would
first buy an option on the vessel or vessels
he wanted
  this deduction was so simple that to

adventure
spring it on sylvester would surprize him
no more than it would suqjrize a stock-
gambler to tell him you knew he was buying
on margin but if williams could get
the scorpion to believe he knew why he
was buying or whom he was buying for-
why in that case he might do business
because people who wanted to buy ships
in anything but a very small way were at
that time rare
  of course i wanted to know about you
and i paid to lind out he growled how
do you think  made my money-by selling
boats so i made up my mind to see you
because there wras money in it because
of course  found out you are trying to
tie up a bunch of steamers on options
i again sylvester rapidly worked
feiita his hands and tongue but his
denial was weak what would he
throw away money like that for-ships
not worth anything did the captain
think him a fool to buy options when ships
were not paying the owners enough to buy
paint he went on hastily to explain
that he knew this because he sold paint
and he went off at a tangent gabbling
about the paint business until williams
shut him up again grinning
  he filled one of the glasses to the brim
and drank to the staring scorpion
  now- he put down the empty glass
i know youre after options but youre
not getting them as fast as you want
because you have to go awful quiet about
it i too have bought options now
it doesnt matter who will take them up-
you know and i know the difference is
that you are buying the options directly
for the final buyers of the steamers while
i am buying on spec with my own money
if i didnt know that your people will be
glad to take my options off my hands at a
profit to me you dont think id have been
fool enough to buy them with times as
they are do you
  the fascinated sylvester shook his head
in agreement
  so  know who youre working for
and i know they want a lot of ships 
have between twenty and thirty ai
steamers tied up that i will turn over to
your people and i have another fleet of
seven right under my hand he was
thinking of silas and his unfortunate in-
vestment in shipping now dont ask
me questions because you wont get any-
thing out of me tell the chap who is
behind you that he can come to my hotel
tomorrow morning if he wants to do busi-
ness at the right price thats all
  he shot a glance at the scorpion and saw
that his surmise had been correct there
was some man behind sylvester and that
man was in gibraltar so far so good
and he had learned that often the most
shrewd men are the most credulous
especially when their suspicions can be
aroused
  when can you deliver sylvester
admitting everything spoke like one deeply
grieved
  whenever i want to charters and
ship can be transferred together if neces-
sary but most of them are only chartered
from voyage to voyage not a one of
them is tied up for more than a month
but of course i have to give in most cases
a certain number of days notice for
a moment williams was afraid his limited
knowledge had caused liim to make a slip
but the scorpion appeared quite satisfied
so he went on but dont imagine
that i tied up forty or fifty thousand
pounds for the fun of it use your brain
sylvester why did i come to you in that
dirty fish-boat
  that was a clever move for the scorpions
mind loved the curved route and the
action of his backer depended greatly upon
sylvesters opinion of williams the cap-
tain did not know it but the scorpion
seeing profits for himself without much
labor had already decided to tell his man
that he had known williams for thirty
years knew him to be worth at least a
hundred and fifty thousand pounds-
there are many men of millions not known
to bradstreet-knew his word to be as
good as a bond and knew all about his
good old english family before him
  later when the way looked very smooth
williams was to realize this character-
painting of the scorpion and now his
lucky words helped the selection of the
brightest colors for sylvesters mind
loved the crooked lane the while he be-
lieved it to be straight the dim the
dark the mysterious appealed to him when
square buying and spiling wouldnt rouse
him to interest yes and he believed
every word williams had told him al-
though he would have called a straight
touching the perils

tale a lie he thought over all he knew
of the captain
  the night he had slipped into gib
dodging the customs and all liis worn-
out state hinting at anything his laughing
when he had asked the scorpion if he cared
to buy so small a ship-sylvester had
not remarked the significance of the phrase
at the time but now it gripped him with
the pinch of a million suggestions-his tak-
ing the money without counting it his
lazing around ever since until his mys-
terious coming that morning and this
wras what it meant it would be w-ell to
keep on the right side of this man a man
of parts-and clever how had he found
out who wanted those options
  sylvester did not know this himself
he only knew smith the agent for the
capitalists but he would never let wil-
liams know that he knew so little later
on when the captain had made much
money because of what sylvester told
smith-then good friends he would make
the captain very drunk-oh he knew
the way-and he would find out but just
now was no time to take any chances with
a promising friendship not that it mat-
tered who was putting up the money
  and we are good friends no he
repeated as williams swung his bulk out
of the shop
  not a bit particular-would do business
with a jackal tell your man tomorrow
morning if he wants to see me very
busy expect to go to london in a day
or two-back right away keep your eyes
open for anything good not in the shipping
line and let me know may help you to
make a shilling or two
 he threw one of his few remaining
shillings at the dirty innkeeper conscious
that sylvester would force him to divide
and left the place to which he had come as a
suppliant-as a man
ill
williams awoke early from a
dream in which old silas rutherford
had begged for a penny and with
silas needing bread had been the woman
and a long line of small rutherfords he
got out of bed feeling like an expectant
child on christmas morning and wrhat
did the stocking hold for him he shaved
remembering the previous day and the
days before that with an angry shame
but he would never be a crawler again
he thrilled to the joy of rebirth what a
pile of lies he had told sylvester who the
devil wras behind the scorpion anyhow
yet he was proud of those lies how much
would he make out of this chance if he
handled it right might get enough out
of it to make up for the four hundred and
fifty
  then he made a large breakfast lit a
cigar and went out to the veranda the
man behind the scorpion would come to
him all right and he did come which
further stimulated the intuitive faith wil-
liams had in himself he was half-way
through the cigar when a boy brought
him a card bearing the name j p smith
with no address or prefix
  and smith himself was just as indefinite
in appearance an englishman appar-
ently with no trace of an accent to indicate
his county he was dressed neatly but
simply clean-shaven and about the same
age as williams
  know ships well eh he remarked as
they sat down in a quiet corner
  yes williams studied him went to
sea for a while until i came into my money
and you
  never wrent to sea but i served some
time in an engineering shop got this scar
there-a furnace-tender hit me with a hot
slice-bar
  he turned his head so that williams
could see a scar across liis left cheek about
three inches in length
  i savvy williams grinned had a
few scraps myself but they mostly left me
alone on account of my size
  this exhausted their introductory sub-
stance for a few minutes neither spoke
then smith said thoughtfully
  sylvester gave me a great account of
you and as he dare not fool me i believe
him and am willing to do business with you
he says you have already bought some
options on ships which seems to prove what
he also says-that you know who the
people are behind this thing do you
williams looked at the other their eyes
met and held the captain spoke quietly
i have the options winch as you say
seems to prove that i do know but dont
you think it better-for me-to act as if
i did not know who is really going to get
the ships i know id like it better if i
o
adventure
thought i was only selling to mr smith
if we have to speak of-of those others-
suppose we call them the firm
  smith laughed softly and dropped his eyes
  so he murmured thats it well
i dont blame you and i feel safe you wont
talk now suppose i put my cards on the
table we have only just begun to buy
options and i was given the job of getting
them because i am not a shipping man
and would not be suspected i had to
come to gibraltar on another matter and
having heard about these scorpions and
their ability to get ships cheap i tied up
this sylvester-telling him nothing so
far we have done but little but soon
i will go to london and get busy with
more men to help me but  have to have
your options of course and of course
you want to sell-bought them for that
reason	
  suppose you transfer all you have
over to me and go out and get all you can
in addition-i will agree to take all you
can get but first can you guarantee
to a transfer from your option-forms to
these-which are perhaps more generous
  he handed williams a printed option-
form which the captain read rapidly as
he had thought no options he naturally
had no objection to saying he could use
the forms
  i will buy smith was saying at ten
shillings a ton for six months from date of
transfer to me you can make your com-
mission and profit from the difference
between the ten shillings and what you
have to pay can you not
  williams thought rapidly his numerous
conversations with other shipmasters had
given him much inside information about
the losses of many firms of ship-owners
apart from what was general knowledge
he had no doubt that many were anxious
to sell and would welcome the chance to
get a few shillings a ton for options he
knew too that his credit and reputation
stood very high with smith-sylvesters
extraordinary agitation had seen to that
by the way why had sylvester been so
upset he questioned smith
  oh smiths face hardened with a
curious expression oh he was just scared
you were going to cut in on him thats all
  he became silent as if with the suspicion
that sylvester knew more than he was
supposed to
  how much will you agree to deliver
smith seemed anxious to keep to business
and get the matter settled
  yvilliams breathed deeply this was
his first plunge
  oh i can promise a hundred thousand
tons if you will agree to take all i can get
over that at ten shillings a ton purchase
price to be not more than an advance of a
fourth of insured value
  will you sign a binding contract to that
effect agreeing to pay me ten shillings a ton
damages for all of the hundred thousand
you fail to deliver
  got a copy of that contract
  from among his many printed forms
smith produced a blank contract pointing
out the various clauses it was a clear
and concise form
  you will have thirty days in which to
deliver a hundred thousand tons to me
each option to run for six months from the
date it is signed is all that satisfactory
seems so williams spoke slowly
i am to contract to deliver to you options
for six months on a hundred thousand
tons of ai steamers no ship to be less than
twentv-five-hundred tons net at ten shil-
lings a ton to me the options to be
drawti on your forms which you supply
if i fail to deliver i am to pay you ten
shillings a ton for all i lack of the hundred
thousand you also agree to buy on the
same terms all over the hundred thousand
that i can get hold of
  that last may be canceled at any time
though wlien we get all we want supple-
mented smith
  sure-youre not buying all the earth
i know that of course you know that
i already have most of that hundred
thousand the options are with my lawyer
in london so all i have to do is transfer
them from my forms to yours i got them
for longer than six months so thats easy
and the final buyer in all cases at no more
than a fourth in excess of insured value
is to be j p smith not the firm eh
  dont talk like that snapped smith
youre not supposed to know about the
firm vou know
  all right mr smith williams re-
torted but i do know this that while
the firm has lots of money you may not
have i have only your word you knowr
that you represent them if you want me
to sign this contract-it means a lot to me
touching the perils

and im financially responsible you know-
you must show me you do represent the
firm that is you must show me the
color of your money
  which was rather a neat speech for a
man with less than a shilling in the world
and with a hotel bill of about seven pounds
but smith was all smiles
  my dear fellow  didnt mean to be
offensive of course you shall have the
money i meant cash anyhow i know
all about you and i want those options
come over to the bank and sign the con-
tract if the fifty is not enough you can
have all the cash you need sylvester told
me that you had tied up most of your loose
capital-quite a lot in those options of
course
  oh fifty will do williams spoke
vaguely having decided to let smith run
things at this stage because his own knowl-
edge of finance was hardly sufficient to let
him lead
  at the bank the contract was signed in
duplicate and duly witnessed then smith
handed williams a check and the husky
sailor came nearer to fainting than ever
before during his twenty-seven years for
williams had expected fifty pounds as a
sort of binder and the check was for fifty
thousand
  through a sort of fog he heard smith
  you will deliver the options to my bank
in london as fast as you get them here
is the address i will be in london myself
shortly as i said good luck to you
because i dont want damages but options
  youll get them all right mumbled
williams marveling at his first experience
of the wonders of good credit
  yet it was all simple enough smith
believed that williams already had some
options and could get more and he wanted
them sylvester-and sylvester dared not
fool smith-had rated williams as first-
class credit what more natural than
smith should imagine it good business to tie
williams to a contract and pay cash
williams was safe and if he failed to
deliver it simply meant the return of the
unused money
  besides mr smith knew a lot of things
that he knew williams could not know
even if he were willing to believe the
captain knew who the final buyer would be
he knew for instance that williams could
not know why the firm was buying ships
which reason smith knew warranted his
taking chances with much larger sums than
he had given to the supposedly responsible
williams
  yet the firm doing business in a large
way load of course its owti corps of private
detectives and kept a line on every man
with whom it did business williams never
knew that the charming american girl who
made his voyage to london so pleasant
and who put mrs silas entirely out of his
mind was mrs smith minus her wredding-
ring-who had been set to keep track of his
doings until the last option had been de-
livered
iv
the yellow star navigation com-
pany was in bad shape and the fact
of its not being alone in its trouble
did not compensate it for its difficulties
freights were so low that the twenty
freighters sailing with the yellow star on
their funnels might as wrell have traveled
in ballast for any profit they made and
the pilling brothers sole owners who had
inherited the business from their father
saw only ruin ahead unless they could sell
but who would buy with the books showing
a loss for many months and practically
every ship-owner in the united kingdom
with ships listed in the brokers offices
  this being their mental and financial
attitude it was no wonder they almost
doubted the cessation of miracles when
captain williams-looking tremendous and
prosperous in his new shiny top-hat and
frock coat-walked into their office smiled
pleasantly and told them he wanted to
purchase a few steamers could they
oblige him by selling
  they of course hadnt thought of doing
such a thing they owned twrenty of the
sweetest tramps on the seas and there was
a sentimental value about every keel
because their dead father had laid the
foundations of the business besides they
hadnt an idle vessel
  captain williams was very sorry but
he intimated that he was willing to buy a
six-months option on the twenty vessels
at five shillings a ton the purchase price
to be one-sixth in advance of the insured
value
  the pilling brothers gasping like men
learning to swim in cold water managed
to ask for a few minutes alone so that they

adventure
could consider the offer williams pulled
out a new watch mentioned that he was
very busy that opiious could be picked
up he believed at even better terms and
said he would wait live minutes
  now the total tonnage of the yellow
star line amounted to eighty thousand
tons consequently williams had offered
the fillings twenty thousand pounds lor
the privilege of buying the twenty ships
any time during the next six months
ll he did not buy the twenty thousand
would be a clear gain to the fillings if
he bought it meant that they could sell
out at about what the ships had cost them
it was all very satisfactory if the man were
sane and responsible for with shipping
conditions what they were what on earth
or rather water did a man want to buy
options for
  the form was liberal too thirty days
notice charters to be taken over if they
were not fulfilled but no charter for longer
than usual voyage to be signed during
option and steamers to be delivered at a
port to be later designated ten days in
that port for inspection during which
demurrage would be paid by prospective
buyer option money not to count toward
purchase price yes it was very satis-
factory if the man were responsible if
he were well it was his money and he
could spend it on wine women song or
ships-and the least wise investment of the
four would be ships
  the pillings looked back on many a
headache that lacked the pleasant memories
of either song sips or kisses but only reeked
with columns of figures crowding like dis-
tracted humans to the left side of the
ledger yes they would sell the options
the terms alter calling wrere very liberal
and the purchase price was satisfactory
they never tried to bargain they were
too anxious too much afraid the large
angel might go elsewhere for his options
  the buyer was j p smith so and
mr williams was his agent well and
good so with details which may be
omitted the deal was closed and williams
delivered eighty thousand tons of ship-
options to smiths bank clearing for himself
the decent profit of twenty thousand
pounds there was still in his possession
ten thousand pounds cf smiths check
which he intended to put to the credit of
silas rutherford
  this notion amused him since his re-
birth he had so expanded that he felt too
big for any petty revenge of course
he wouldnt mind doing tome tiling big
thus making the woman sorry she had
turned him down hut nothing petty
besides he wanted to earn some more
money and he felt sure that silas would
sell thus he thought very contented
a the train whirled him north to the city
of silas rutherford looking forward to
the interview the old man would cer-
tainly be startled
  but the black town enveloped him with
a certain degree of nervousness as its grimy
outlying suburbs began to throw their
tentacle-like streets about the railroad
track slowing the train he had to light
down the heart-beats roused by the asso-
ciation of ideas forcing himself to look
upon bis love for the woman as if it were a
disgusting disease stripping her of the halo
with which he had once endowed her
seeing her as a rag and a bone and a hank
of hair -and not too clean hair or rags
at that and finally when the train
reached the station he achieved calm
  there was satisfaction about signing his
name in the register of the best hotel with
his tall liat somewhat on the back of his
head then wisely he took a cab to the
office of a first-class lawyer told him about
the loss of the psyche omitting no details
and leaving a handsome retainer against
the possible board of trade investigation
which however would be unlikely to drag
in anything about liis crime but it seemed
best to play safe he could put up good
bail if the wrorst happened and leave silas
to hold the bag as he deserved for silas
was not in the happy position of having
all his assets comfortably stowed in his
breast pocket and could never make a
run for it because he was anchored to
his investments by the steel cable of miser-
liness
  worse the poor old fool was stranded
on the shoals of matrimony unable to run
for the open sea and safety with a woman
scraping at a hole in his ribs with every lift
and settle he made to the tide of life
williams reveling in his metaphofs began
to realize the benefits of freedom and to
feel that what he had taken for the shackles
of love was mere tissue-paper disguised in
tinfoil he devoured an excellent dinner
and walked happily through the smoky
touching the perils

early dark of september puffing no longer
at a pipe but at a two-shilling cigar
  it was after office hours but williams
had waited purposely knowing the ways
of silas and wanting to meet him when
alone of course there was the chance
of his staying home now that he was
married but the captain thought other-
wise remembering cynically that the wed-
ding had occurred some weeks before
  and he was right true for a few days
the old man had lingered by his fireside-at
home rather for silas allowed no heat
in his house before late october-but he
had soon pleaded the call of business and
gone back to his old habit of sitting in his
lonely office bemoaning liis unlucky invest-
ment in ships and his wife had made no
objection she had pretended of course
but had secretly rejoiced when he left her
and williams stepping quietly found the
outer door open and went in
  he paused to think for a moment on the
number of times he had entered that office
full of a craven fear that he might lose his
job then he squared hi shoulders and
went forward still so quiet that silas did
not hear him but saw him framed in the
doorway of the private office when he
happened to look up and for a moment
the old man imagined he was looking at a
ghost
  then the captain shut the door sat down
by the desk and lit another cigar but he did
not remove his shiny hat
  didnt expect to see me did you you old
thief he began pleasantly
  silas made no reply williams was cer-
tainly not a ghost but he was decidedly
an apparition-what with the frock coat
the tall hat the jewelry the cigar and
above all the assured manner he was so
unlike the old williams that he was only
just recognizable as that person and the
first coherent thought of silas was the wish
that williams had always been as he then
was-in which case the woman would have
never thrown him down
  i dont need that dirty four hundred
and fifty-im a rich man now-but im
going to make you sorry for what you did
  i am sorry williams very sorry and
so full of truth was the old voice that the
captain believed him
  you mean it
  yes i mean it but not about the
money you wouldnt believe me if i said
i was sorry about the moneys and i dont
blame you but ill give you a check for
that right away williams i wish i could
give you back all i robbed you of so easily
he looked so old seemed so tired so
utterly disappointed with life that wil-
liams who had come in anger became
sympathetic he watched the veined
trembling hand writing the check and
coughed to hide an unexpected swell of
emotion
  yes williams- the old man handed
the captain the check-maybe i was
alone too long maybe i was never meant
for a married man and maybe i got the
wrong sort of a woman but just as i sit
here she sits at home-- want my ships to
sink she wants me to die and i must
leave her my money it dont seem right
not to does it
  there is a clannishness about sex wil-
liams had gone to silas with anything but
friendly feelings but now he found himself
taking sides with him-against the woman
   if i was you id give her fifty thousand
and tell her to get a divorce get drunk
tell her to have witnesses and take a
strange woman home with you some night
shed jump at the chance to cry in court
its the best wray out of it-infidelity and
cruelty you know
  but wailed silas im a deacon of my
church-have been for forty-odd years
its the devil how a mans youthful
follies dog liis life isnt it answered
williams gravely but i wouldnt let
that stop me you can easily square the
church with a fat check and a public con-
fession of sin weep a bit and beg em
to take you back into the fold they
like you all the better for it its a cinch
the old man brightened then he became
unhappy
  but think of the expense williams
think of the expense he groaned with
shipping the way it is
  why as to that i can help you
williams exclaimed as if the idea had just
come to him i have come into a tidy
bit of money you see not got it all
through the courts yet but got a good bit
of it ive always wanted to be a ship-
owner-all skippers do-and i wouldnt
wonder if things looked up soon as i said
i	can not get hold of all my money just nowr
but ill pay you five shillings a ton for an
option to purchase your seven ships at

adventure
their insured value option to run for six
months
  sav that all over again the old man
nearly screamed
      williams repealed his statement
and the old man began to think to
look for a trap this looked too good
to be true but then williams always was
a fool and if he wanted to tie up his inheri-
tance in ships that was his lookout there
was no way sikte could be cheated if he
watched out
  looks to me like a temporary drop
thats all he said oihly it wouldnt sur-
prize me a bit to see freights take a big jump
pretty soon who left you the money
  none of your bally business snarled
williams and you cant fool me about
freights going up me and my partner
want seven steamers if you wont sell
at the price i mentioned-the option is
because my money may be six months
before getting through the court-i can
easily get some one who will now what
are you going to do
  price is till right if the form is silas
spoke hastily
  it would never do to let this golden oppor-
tunity get away from him
  williams gave him one of smiths printed
forms and the old man read and rereau it
carefully
  tliats all right and regular you
must be buying from more than me to go
to the expense of getting these special forms
printed but i ought to get more than the
insured value
  you can either take what i offered or
keep your ships williams retorted deter-
mined to keep silas down to the price
although the agreement with smith per-
mitted him a fairly wide margin above it
  and finally silas agreed very inquisitive
about the smith party and the source of the
inheritance-a curiosity williams did not
satisfy
  and finally the captain left the city
without troubling to see the woman he
had once adored and unaware that she
had waited for him every day after her
husband had told her about his wonderful
change in condition and circumstance
he left without being troubled by the board
of trade feeling sorry for silas asa matter
of fact he was doing too wrell to hate any-
body for a telegram from smith in loudon
liad invited him to dinner and to bring
all the options with him he might have
succeeded in buying
  and smith was radiant admitting that
everything was going splendidly he paid
williams for his options and promised to
pay for any more he could get the con-
tract which had been carried out was
returned then they dined in a place
which williams had only heard about
but in his new dress-suit he acted as if
he had eaten in such places ever since he
began on solid food and the wine flowed
very freely
  i can get you more options yet prom-
ised williams
  excellent my dear friend excellent
do you want die money now or when you
deliver
  lord williams grinned expansively
some curious intuition making him pretend
that the wine had affected liim more than
it really had lord i can trust you we
are all in die same boat arent we
  smith smiled as one knowing himself to
be sober smiles at one he imagines to be
drunk
  yes he murmured all in the same
boat my dear williams but we didnt
all get into the boat the same way did
we
  williams laughed fatuously then his
voice rather hoarse
  no we did not you know how i got
in how did you-pier-head jump or first-
class passenger
  it was hardly a polite question not a
politely worded quesrion but smith merely
looked at the bottle and smiled again
as if you didnt know he suggested
oh williams felt very much as when
he first talked to the scorpion-as if he
were trying to find his way in the dark
oh i suppose you were bom that way
  	was a silly remark but smith glanced
at him keenly-
  think so he asked shortly
  know it just as i know that i wasnt
youre a clever man smith com-
plimented far more so than even i at
first believed he spoke thoughtfully
but we are the best of friends and can
trust one anodier tell me how did you
find out that sylvester was buying options-
gibs a queer place in a way for that
and how did you discover who is to be die
final buyer-who are the firm eh
touching the perils

  williams fumbled with the tip of a cigar
then clumsily bit it again laughing foolishly
  you know smith he went on with the
portentous gravity of the intoxicated
im a good englishman but i aint a fool
about it theres lots of people dont
like to see an english ship sold to foreigners
but i dont care if the red ensign is changed
to the hottentot flag if i can make money
out of it did you say the czar of russia
was president of the firm would you say
that
  no i wouldnt but i will say youre
drunk smith spoke impatiently whats
the use of all this fencing about the thing
as youll find when you try to buy we have
picked up about all the options we want
you know as well as i do that american
capital is behind this buying of course
we had to keep it quiet and dont intend
to talk now but it was kind of annoying
for you and me to pretend there was a mys-
tery about it you knew from the first
meeting that i was an american just as
you know that america has been sorry
she hadnt a merchant fleet
  where you got the hint i do not know
but you knew america lacked building
facilities and that it would be cheaper to
buy from the british especially with
shipping on the blink as it has been
besides it would have taken too long to
have built our own fleet and watch
freights go up when we call our options
but its a bit of a joke on your country eh
wont the lion roar better become an
american citizen old man
  williams head sank forward as if he were
falling asleep and smith raised his hand to
shake him into wakefulness muttering-
wonder if he only guessed-knowing
that america was the only place with
enough private capital to swing such a
deal
 v
so that was it what a blind
bat he had been not to see through
the scheme williams still pretend-
ing drunkenness thought as smith saw him
to his room but it was all right if
americans wanted to buy what the british
wanted to sell whose business was it of
course there would be a howi from the
press but why couldnt the british ship-
owners have thought of a gigantic combine
which would have given them powrer to
make their own freight rates as the american
buyers intended to do well let them
howl they needed waking up in england
  smith leaving london the next day
for some place he did not mention called
to say good-by and to remind williams
of his promise to say nothing about the
big deal until it was consummated and
when williams promised readily enough
smith rewarded him with the advice that
he would be wrasting his lime to look for
more options there might be one or two
ships not tied up wrhich the owners were
willing to sell but he doubted it and
williams found he was right liverpool
london belfast-every shipping town in
the kingdom was visited by the captain
but not a single option could he purchase
  whew some deal he muttered as the
size of the thing dawned upon him well
i cant kick it helped me
  and he decided to visit the town of his
birth and indulge in a gentle spree
  but the spree did not stop at the gentle
stage it developed into the most involved
experience of its kind in the captains
eventful life famous among his brother
officers for his capacity he was now finan-
cially able to do himself proud so when
he had hajd enough of it what with the time
consumed running about england looking
for options and the time taken up by that
remarkable dissipation some months had
passed since his farewell with smith and
events had occurred which the captain
never a reading man had not heard about
for whenev er a boon companion had at-
tempted to discuss the news of the day
williams had choked him off with more
palatable suggestion
  thus it happened when coming out of
the turkish bath he encountered one of the
pilling brothers who looked as if he also
had indulged freely
  been having a good time asked the
jovial captain
  i have smith has called the option
you knowr in about a week our first ship
will be delivered at the port designated
its a relief to be free
  what port
    illiams wras uninterested but asked for
the sake of something to say and pilling
told him adding the information that the
options given by several other ship-owners
friends of his had likewise been called-
for delivery at the same or adjacent ports

adventure
  humph muttered williams to himself
as he walked along the beach the firm
must have charters already from there-
arent wasting any time
  so he walked along the beach of the
large watering-place that he remembered
as a boy as a small fishing village and
arriving at the end of the esplanade sat
down on a bench to smoke presently an
old man sat down by his side and began to
read a newspaper
  terrible time coming remarked the
old man after a while
  what do you mean drawled williams
indifferently
 what do i mean the old was
annoyed well ill explain if you can
not see it for yourself it means war
that shooting of the archduke was the
starter
  oh the captain dimly remembered
hearing of that affair
  yes went on the other i believe it
was arranged those germans would do
anything cunning devils
  well wre should trouble remarked
williams we wont get into any scrap
if we did we have the navy
  the old man snorted
  yes we have but well be into it
youll see that and the germans will find
some way of starving us out
  eh williams was interested at last
  yes they will cunning devils you
can not tell them from englishmen or
americans they speak the language so
well starve us out they will and the
countrys full of them-ill spies why
there goes one of them now
  williams stared at the well-dressed man
with the single eyeglass who walked slowly
past them
  how do you know hes a german he
whispered
  that scar-on his cheek-look quick
hissed the old man they get them
dueling
  for a moment williams sat as if petrified
then with an oath he jumped to his feet
and began to run toward the railway
station leaving the astounded old gentle-
man to speculate upon his sanity
  but captain williams was quite sane-
as sane if not more so than ever before
in his life-even if his mind was racing with
maddening thoughts
  for it was all clear now he saw the
scheme from the very beginning yet its
cleverness might well have been too much
for the brightest of men sylvester had
been scared because he had guessed-or
knew-that smith was a german-or
more likely he w-as really a german spy
and afraid of being discovered by the
british for gib is a had place for cap-
tured spies besides sylvester was a
british subject-consequently if be were
a spy he was also a traitor which ex-
plained his agitation and smiths curious
expression when williams had referred to it
and how careless smith had been about
the price to be paid for the steamers on
delivery
  lie had hardly mentioned it allowing
williams to suggest the price no wonder
when he knew that there was no intention
of paying any delivery money and how
easy smith had been about parting with the
fifty thousand of course such a tiling
might happen in business and the contract
signed by williams in the gibraltar bank
had mentioned everything gone into all
the usual clauses such as bottomry bonds
attachments and the like how smith
must have smiled at that
  what did he care about attachments
once the ships were delivered into german
ports and wiiat was fifty thousand in
such a deal-when the option money was
all that they were going to pay oh he
sawr it he saw it and the options were
called options on at least eight-tenths of
the shipping of the british empire on the
eve of war they were being delivered to
german ports the old man on the bench
had said that germany was only waiting
till some prearranged moment before de-
claring war and williams believed him
but would any one else believe
  by god he would force them to eight-
tenths of british shipping lured into ger-
man ports for ten shillings or less a ton
williams had given little heed that after-
noon when pilling had told him that all his
ships were to be delivered in hamburg
and that the ships of other owners who
had sold options were going to bremen
hamburg and other german ports but
he heeded now why in a week or so all
those ships would be in german ports
and while the owners waited for their
money war would come how cunning
that time arrangement which could be
extended on excuse with liberal demurrage
santanta

  cunning and the cunning of smith
up to the last he had known williams
was pretending to be drunk and when he
shook him in the restaurant he had spoken
as if he believed he were speaking to a
drunken man-must have guessed that
america was the only country with enough
private capital to swing such a deal
cunning yes he had been cunning if
the old man had not called attention
to the scar on the face of that passing
german or if that german had not
passed at the time-but for that germany
would have starved england into sur-
render in a few weeks on what tiny
incidents do the fates of empires hang
but would others believe as williams be-
lieved
  running frantically along the platform
his tall hat in his waving hand the captain
just caught the train but would lie be
in time would he be believed not
about the options-that could be proved-
but about the certainty of war there
was no sense in senamg a telegram he
would be considered crazy and arrested
and there was only one man to see-the
prime minister but whsft could the
minister do even if williams made him
believe that the option-buying was a war
move
  the captain had no idea but he had
great faith in that important official he
would see him-even if he had to fight his
way to him the shipping of the empire
tricked irfto germanys ports-at ten shil-
lings or less a ton yes they were clever
but for the scar he would never have
guessed it slice-bar- he had thought
it a queer unhandy sort of weapon when
smith had told him the lie
  williams did not sleep that night and
when in the very early morning he reached
london he raced to the first taxi on the
stand shouting to the surprized driver-
  number  downing street and drive
like-
  and the ministers servants were also
surprized they were accustomed to
cranks of all sorts but this big man seemed
different he didnt shout or rave and
his low tense voice was commanding
still they couldnt let him in it was too
early they explained would he come
again later later they would be pre-
pared for him
  but williams refused to come later he
wanted to see the prime minister right
away if he were still in bed he must be
wakened the matter could not wait
and he made as if to push by them
  the servants looked at one another-
two big footmen but neither of them
anxious to tackle this big madman one
made a sign-phone the police while he
held the fellow off with talk but the
captain saw the sign and guessed its mean-
ing with head down-top hat still in
place-he was preparing to charge as he
would have charged refractory sailors
when another voice broke in-
  what is it james
  and williams saw the prime minister
coming dqwn the hall he never remem-
bered how he obtained that interview
his torrent of words was beyond his con-
trol but he found himself sitting in a
famous room alone with the great man-
where the fate of britain had so often been
decided
while the world knows that just
before the outbreak of war ger-
many nearly succeeded in trapping
a part of the british navy in kiel this is
the first published account of her almost
successful attempt to trap eight-tenths of
the british merchant fleet and so starve
england into an early and ignominious
surrender
santanta
by w a sternberg
tiat portion of kansas now
included within the boundaries
of ellswwth county was diffi-
cult to reclaim from the red
men the country was well grassed and
watered with sheltering belts of timber
along the streams making it a favorite
indian hunting-ground swarming as it was
with buffalo elk antelope and smaller
game white buffalo-hunters soon learned
how desirable the country was and made
persistent and finally successful efforts to

adventure
establish homes there all praise to those
courageous pioneers
  general hancock in the summer of
 was at fort harker organising an
expedition against the indians that cam-
paign and its failure have passed into
history but an amusing incident connected
with it will be recalled by surviving old
settlers this incident might properly
be entitled how the famous war-chief
santanta bull-conned the general
  hancock made great effort to conciliate
the hostiles he had several talks with
santanta and his chiefs carefully observing
traditional indian council formalities the
pipe of peace was smoked in solemn state
and much big talk followed the love and
affection of the great father at washing-
ton for liis red children was carefully
explained as it had been time and again
for more than a hundred years many
valuable presents were made the indians
and among others general hancock gave
santanta a complete major-generals uni-
form sword sash epaulets and gorgeous
cocked hat and plume but the talks all
ended in smoke
  general hancock wanted to get his
troops alongside the indian camp but
santanta divined his purpose and pro-
longed the talk until all his women and
children got away as soon as this was
safely accomplished he and his warriors
made themselves scarce this expedition
proving a failure it was soon disbanded
  not long before general hancocks first
talk with santanta the indians lad cap-
tured a government ambulance with its
team of four mules santanta represented
to the general the capture of this ambulance
was not approved by him that it was the act
of some of his young men who he was
sorry to say did not love their father in
washington as santanta did that it
would afford him great pleasure to return
the great father his mules and ambulance
but unfortunately at that moment he was
off color with liis braves by reason of his
great love for the white man ami aval
chiefs pointed the finger of scorn at
him saying he had a white mans heart
that if santanta should take these mules
and ambulance from the young men thev
would not listen when he should urge
them to be like santanta a friend of the
while man and obey the great white chief
and much more of the same chaff-all with
one object which he accomplished the
capture of the mules and ambulance-and
the killing of the driver-was passed over
and they tacitly went with the oilier
presents
  i have a vivid recollection-the danger
from indians having passed until grass
should be green again-being at fort
harker one day of seeing a four-mule
ambulance rapidly approaching the post
along the fort zara trail the mules lashed
to a gallop by a filthy breech-clouted
indian the curtains had been cut away
and there in his major-generals uniform
epaulets cocked hat plume and all with
boiled shirt worn outside his trousers arms
folded face coveredith dirt and dignity
sat the renowned terror of the plains the
redoubtable santanta his driver put the
mules around the parade-ground once or
twice encouraging them with such fiendish
yells as only an indian can produce
when the importance of his chief had been
sufficiently exhibited he stopped and
santanta paid a visit of state to liis brother
general sully
  santanta was low in stature broad-
shouldered deep-chested and crooked-
legged and seated there in a captured
government ambulance wearing the uni-
form of a major-general in the united
slates army his broad face greasy and
horrid he made a picture which was not a
caricature but a sad commentary on the
governments then paternal method of
dealing with indians
  with the next seasons grass came those
dark and bloody days which are burned
deep into the memory of the surviving early
settlers of lincoln and ellsworth counties
and which established santantas reputa-
tion as one of the most cruel ravages the
plains ever produced

the wilderness

i had been in the out-of-the-way eng-
lish inn for three days before i noticed
that jarvis wore service stripes he
was flitting noiselessly like a bam
swallow about the low-ceiled tap-room
where i had sat alone for an idle hour
when i remarked-
  i see youve served jarvis
  harrdly sor i got strafed the very
first day i landed in belgium sor in the
neck sor i wasnt out of england a
week
are you an irishman jarvis i queried
well not exactly sor me mother
was a jewess and me father a yorkshire-
man but i was born and raised in dublin
until i was seventeen years old
  ireland must be some melting-pot
i mused aloud
  well sor it is in a way but not like
the states sor ive been to hamerica
sor
  oho i thought i detected an american
accent
  well yed harrdly say that sor i
wasnt there long enough for that
  were you in new york i questioned
for his respectful and serious air seemed to
mask a certain sly humor that promised
some amusement
  he seemed more like a schoolmaster
than a waiter
  in new york yes sor and to green-
wood lake new jersey do you know
that place sor he asked
  every foot of it i replied ive
been going there since i was a boy
  indade ive only met three people in
me life that had visited it then sor
you may have known degraws hotel
loikely
a
  as well as my own club but i dont
recall you jarvis
   twas manny years ago sor and i
wasnt there long he said with a sigh
gazing reflectively down the hedge-bor-
dered lane its sorry i am often enough
that i didnt stick it out
  what was the matter with greenwood
lake i demanded
  faith nawthin at alt sor he an-
swered as if surprized the lake was
perfectly satisfactory-a good bit of all
right sor but i had a peculiar experience
there one that i dont talk about much
without a hint of warning that i was
about to get a jolt from out of the halcyon
carefree life of long ago i spoke up
  wrell this is a good talking day loosen
up the tale shoot
twas whin i was just cornin
twinty-one whin i was workin in a
hotel in liverpool that i got the
notion of immigratin to hamerica sor
whin one o thim steamship wars was on
and tickets were cheap i landed in new
york with a letter of ricommendation to a
parrty in omaha but the very day i landed
before i found out where omaha was
mr degraw hired me for a bartender at
the imployment bureau he took me
across the ferry and put me on the train
intinding to send me alone but then he
changed his mind says he
  im afraid yer so new to the counlhry
that somebodyll be snatchin you and
puttin yer into a silo ill go with yer
twas a fine counthry sor rollin and
with manny fine towns and houses whin
we got up into the mountains where twas
wild and wooded he says to me-

adventure
and what is it youre lookin for so
sharply me man
whin  told him that i was watching for
to see the aborigines and the buffaloes he
says says he
  buffalo bill killed the last one in new
jersey in the spring of  and the injins all
wear regular clothes now like human beins
but youll find they havent changed their
manners me lad whin you see them lined
up before the bar especially the ones from
essex county dye mind
  and the cowboys sor with their
lassoos and horses ive seen only farmin
machinery i says
  oh youll not see a cowboy this side of
chicago says mr degraw you must
know says he that theres little excite-
ment up here in the mountains all the
bad-men gun-fighters and train-robbers
hang out in the big cities and if youre
keen for that sort of life you should have
stayed in new york
  the weather was bally hot sor the
thermometer hanging in the car registerin
all of eighty-tnree quite bloomin trop-
ical indeed but about the time i was
minded to remove my coat as my employer
and everybody else had done we arrived
in higher regions and i preserved my self-
respect sor it was much cooler at the
lake
  the bar sor was in the pool-room near
the water some distance from the hotel
the stock was very superior and i thought
that whole situation wasnt half bad the
landlord instructed me in misan many
hamerican drinks next mornin in the
daytime twas mostly lydies who frequented
the pool-room playin lhe game very skill-
fully  should say but i gathered from
their conversation that saturdays and
sundays were much enlivened by the
presence of husbands
  it was an extraordinary quiet spot sor
my word i anticipated much from the
expected arrival towards evening of a favor-
ite visitor a newspaper-man from newark
in the province of new jersey by name of
mack who was an inveterate joker
  i gathered the idea that he was some sort
of a big mogul from hearing mrs degraw
tell another lydy that mack was a prince
that he was a genuine indian i was
charmed at the idea dont you know of
encountering one of the aboriginal princes
for mr degraw had told me that they were
rapidly passing away because of their
adoption of the vice of dgaret smoking
  it was an orfal hot day incredible hot
sor witherin as you might sav but
nobody seemed to mind it actually the
landlords wife had worn a beaver cape
over her shoulders that mornin twas
eighty six at three oclock when mr mack
and his friends arrived bringing with him
for their entertainment a brass hand of five
men he was a man in his forties fat
dark-haired with piercing brown eyes
and a grand out jutting nose but his skin
was as fair as your own sor
  still he had the gloomy stem look that
one naturally would expect in an indian
chief and the preposterous heat seemed
to have no effect upon him or his friends
except to give em a thirst he was very
affable indeed-no royal airs at all-and he
asked me manny questions about the old
counthry after the landlord told him i was
from ireland-especially about banshees
plxies and the likes o that
  there was two of them that hadnt come
by name of otoole and okeefe being
kept by other ingagements until night
when they were cornin by carriage a fifty-
mile trip sorry the day they ever started
the german band serenaded the ladies
at the hotel and then they all took posses-
sion of the pool-room-all but the indian
prince and an artist chap who went out
fishin i asked mr degraw what his
highness preferred in the way of liquor
  what dve mean highness says he
  the indian prince sor mr mack
sor i says
  who told you he was an injin he
asks
  i heard your good lydy say so sor
yesterday i presume tiiis is the same
gentleman sor says i
  gosh its a mighty good thing young
feller that you spoke to me about him
if he suspected that you knew he was an
injin its ten to one that hed scalp you
before you knew he had his knife out
dont open your face and let out any
highness or prince stuff while hes here-
not on your hatpin not on your hat-
pin says he
  if all hamericans were like that parrty
prohibition would have come in the states
long years ago through a natural failure of
supplies sor sure they kept degraw
and me busy ordering tilings by names that
a night in the wilderness
i
i more than suspect they invented right
there and more than one deadly quarrel
degraw only previnted by smoothness
and blarney the wise man the german
band doubtless aided him in that begad
it was a fine one
when the prince returned he
brought with him a snake hed
just caught he handled it in a
manner to chili your blood they told
me he had a fondness for the creatures and
often carried them about in his pockets
he said it was a brindled rattlesnake and
extremely poisonous but that he had it
charmed as you might say and offered to
let me hold it in my hands
  wurroo sor i can feel at this minute
the deadly chill that struck down my
legs as he reached the squirmin sarpent
toward me he said hed keep it to show
petey otoole who was addicted to snakes
even when he was sober and he put it into
his trousers pocket
  for men of their age-for they were all
years older than me-that was the liveliest
crowd i ever saw they frolicked like
schoolboys and drank like bloomin hatters
with wrastlin and boxin and jumpin in
that torrid heat sor they sported till sun-
down and in the cool o the evenin they
sat around listening to the sweet strains
of the band
  by and by they began to boast of their
doins to annoy mr degraw for i had
soon discovered that he was the county
sheriff and sor i heard some shockin
details of crime but degratv only laughed
and said it was lucky for them that these
deeds had been outlawed by the immunity
act or theyd be dissolving in quick-
lime that very hour and a milder-lookin
lot of blokes you couldnt have found on
anny summer night the world over
  every onct in a while somebody would
regret the absince of otoole and okeefe
and that would start another story about
one or the other of these men something
that would start off innocint belike and
wind up with the creeps in your liver sor
  dye mind says one the time they
stole the red-hot stove from the mamin
register office and piled pavin stones agin
the door and sat there in the snow-storm
till daylight drinkin applejack while the
police was cartin away the stones afraid to
meddle with em
  i do that says the prince  twas
the very next day that okeefe attacked
me with a cuban machete in murrays
saloon and i had to lay him out with a
brass cuspidor i carry the scar of the
cut he gave me to this day but those
were rough old times you remember the
night otoole got the cab-drivers into
minks to buy them a drink and we stole
every cab in newark and drove to belleville
with them
  yes that was awful okeefe had
no excuse for killin the mayor of belleville
even if it was a prohibition town says
another chap just because the mayor
called him a white-livered home rule mick
from galway t wasnt right
  you may see sor that i did not regret
the absince of these two men from this
social gatherin for i could readily perceive
that they were desperate characters of the
type depicted by bret harrte in his  jumpin
frog stories although i gathered that they
were irishmen of a sort but a bit later
we heard shots in the distance and almost
immediately afterward came the two des-
peraydoes in the vehicle they call by the
curious name of buggy sor one of
them-that was otoole-was a small red-
headed skinny chap with a mild eye the
verry last youd take for a bad one and the
other was more like a parson than a hard-
ened murderer a fine tall clean-lookin
lad with curly hair but very profane with
his language
  hurroo we did the fifty miles in two
and a half hours swoppin horses every five
miles sings out okeefe
  youre a liar it cant be did says
the prince
  youre no gentleman you decrepit old
horse-thief it was did says otoole
climbin down in a hurry well have
the constables of nine towns after us for
shooting up each burg we passed through
they all crowded indoors and okeefe
yells out
  rum rum and a bucket of blood
  mr degraw whispers to me
  be discreet me boy in talkin to these
birds theyve been drinkin some i can
see that we dont want anv trouble here
tonight
  give us a couple of nitroglvcerin cock-
tails yells okeefe
  we are all out of nitroglycerin says
mr degraw very smooth

adventure
  nix nix none of that stuff otoole
bawls out and the man reaches for his hip
pocket his little eyes blazin
  hold on dont draw for you might
have to shoot   says degraw as cool as you
please i may have some up at the
house
  he went after it and he was gone-some
time the prince motioned otoole to
come outside and i could see him talkin
earnestly to him in the light from the
doorway  conjectured that he was ad-
visin him to act with discretion
  well sor if i could have been whisked
out o that and over to old ireland by
givin up ten years o my life id gladly
have done it every time otooles eye
rested on me ray insides froze-and twas
a hot night dye mind when mr degraw
came back he had a tumbler half full of
some white stuff that he hands to otoole
and says he
  heres your soul-poisoner and may you
choke i had to steal it from under old
duy fosters bed while he was asleep if
hed woke up he would have bored me
otoole takes it and says he
  none of your tricks are you sure
youre not trying to slip over some of that
turpentine flavorin or french perfume like
you did the last time
  taste it you rattlesnake says degraw
otoole tasted it smiled and passed it to
okeefe
   tis the real old safe-blowin juice-and
fresh says he mix the cocktails-and
for all hands dye mind
  then they all began to protest that they
didnt drink that deadly stuff but okeefe
pulls out a pistol sor and when the drinks
was mixed they drank them without
objectin otoole shook his head with
his mouth wide open and says he boys
if i gritted my teeth id blast my jaw off
now its whisky and other soft stuff that
ill have to stick to tonight okeefe ill
play you a game of pool though my hands
are raw from drivin them fiery untamed
steeds
  with that they went to playing pool
me vatchin them and divvle a one of em
was showin any effects from drinkin the
stuff sor the prince whispered to de-
graw and he came to me and told me to
water some whisky in a bottle and serve
these two with it as they were like to make
trouble i done that same and the very
next time they took a drink they spat and
looked hard at me my blood turned to
ice sor otoole put his hand across
okeefes chest and says he
  hold on john no killin mabbe the
boy has a mother as you had onct
  since when has a mere mother-or even
a mother-in-law for the matter o that-
stopped you or me petey otoole hes
watered our booze
  the whole crowd threw themselves on
them and degraw told them id given
them whisky out of the bottle reserved for
the man with delirium trimmins that was
boarding there finally okeefe calmed
down and went back to the pool-table
the prince called on the band for music
i could see that there was bad blood between
the two and i never took my eyes off them
sor in the midst of the music they began
to quarrel over the game callin each other
mortal bad names just as the band
stopped playin okeefe shook his fist
in otooles face and says he-
  you half-portion of a hackensack
coprolite
  i mind the word well otoole stepped
back pulled out a revolver and with a yell
fired straight at okeefes stomach not a
yard away he fell without a word-just
crumpled up dropped on his face turned
over and lay still there beside the pool-
table
even in that horrible moment
sor  noticed that all of them turned
and looked at me instead of at the
murderer that is all except the german
band who were too frightened to move
otoole dropped the pistol and darted out
into the darkness but-the crowd fell over
each other to get out after him i did
not feel that it was my duty to join them
as i was a foreigner dont you know but
i would have been of no service as i was
badly funked
  i suppose i was as pale as the band-
leader who sat staring at the corpse in
horror one man soon returned and asked
me where he could get a rope to hang the
murderer with when they caught him
before i could reply he took down mrs
degraws beaver cape that hung on a peg
on the wall and covered up the head and
shoulders of the dead man in a solemn
and reverent manner that quite touched me
sor
a night in the wilderness

  i could hear them yellin and makin
uncouth sounds in the distance for some
time as they searched but soon they all
drifted in-all but the prince and degraw
they told me that these two who were old
woodsmen would soon round up the black-
hearted spalpeen and bring him back dead
or alive the prince they said was quite
likely to kill him first and ask questions
afterward they told me to remember
every detail for i would be the most im-
portant witness and this made me very
nervous every few minutes one or two
of them were compelled by their emotions
to go outside
  suddenly there came a wild thrillin
yell from out of the dark starless night
out they rushed between the dead man
inside and a murderer loose outside i felt
like siftin tight sor when they came in
they had the artist chap drippin wet who
said that he had been pushed into the
lake by some unseen hand lie thought
it was otooles i was much upset by
their indecent levity sor for they split
their sides at his misfortune even in the
presence of the corpse it was quite
shockin
  none of them knew the bally counthry
about there and they were afraid of bein
lost in the dark besides otoole was
well armed having another pistol besides
the one he had dropped as i omitted to
mention beside the corpse and which had
been laid behind the bar right near me
which increased my nervous horrors they
knew so many details about the lives of
otoole and okeefe and related so many
of them sor that i was really made
quite ill
  finally along about midnight a loud
war-whoop that chilled my veins called
them out and soon they returned with the
villain otoole they had evidently
handled him roughly enough and sheriff
degraw had handcuffed him so that he was
quite harmless as you might say but he
glared at me as if about to spring at me
and the artist chap got between us and
he says
  let us give this fiend in human shape
a dose of lynch-law right here and now and
string him up hes as guilty as-says
he and hes cheated the gallows many
times already you remember how he got
off after killing lhe old woman over at
smoky hollow
  we do that says the prince and do
you mind how he slipped out of the noose
the time he cut the throats of the two
school-teachers in goshen
  sure hes a bally bad one gaid the
sheriff its agin my oath of office to
countenance such work but well try him
tonight
  cant you wait until tomorrow so i can
send for a lawyer asks otoole with a
groan
  we can not says the prince youll
have to play your hand alone this time
petey me boy
  so they started to try him they made
me give my testimony first it was a
sweatin job sor with otooles devilish
eyes burnin holes into me bewhilst when
i was through degraw says
  we saw it all a hundred witnesses
wouldnt add to the proof well hang
him on young jarvis evidence alone
hes done for me says otoole its
lucky for him that this is a dirty lynch-law
trial or id get him sure later as it is
my spook will hant you young feller till
your dyin day may your food choke you
may your booze taste like bilge-water
may your feet be cold in winter and roast
in summer and may your wife take your
earnings to asbury park
  be reasonable otoole says the
prince the boys only done his duty
to the counthry-
  hes no better than a lousy informer
cries otoole men i ask you as a per-
sonal favor not to hang me like a horse-
thief shoot me and let me die like the
good old scout i am okeefe only got
what was cornin to him and well he de-
served it he stole both my wives i
forgave him and in fact paid the carfare
on- one occasion i overlooks his weakness
when he double-crossed me the time we
robbed the prudential bank and killed the
old cashier who was my second-cousin
but he wrent too far for human endurance
the night he set the opera house on fire
and burned up ninety-six women and
children
  ah did he do that deed asks
degraw he was that overcome he leans
on the shoulder of the prince and both of
them were sobbin sor but the prince
with a deep frown says
  raw stuff pete and old this isnt
a newark jury

adventure
  take off these cuffs and shoot me
quick says the man i have thirty
dollars in me jeans send them to the
elks lodge for to bury me with
  hand them here says the artist chap
ill attend to that
 the - you will says otoole
only over my dead body you four-eyed
ink-slinger ill match you for the thirty
degraw took off the handcuffs and says
says he
  now stand over here by the corpse
jarvis you hand me that gun on the shelf
yonder ill shoot you myself
  faith i was mighty slow in reachin for
the weapon as you may well believe sor
and before i laid my hand on it otoole
leaped through the door like a bloomin
rabbit and was gone wid the whole pack
after him yellin like fiends all that is
but the artist chap and he says in great
alarm
  hide behind the bar lad youre as
good as dead if he doubles back in the dark
to get you it was your evidence that
convicted him and hell take a chance
to pay ypu back
  i laid myself down behind the bar and
there i stayed until they all returned
  well put the bloodhounds on his trail
in the morning-if i can finish with my
havin says the sheriff
  its on my mind that hell drown hisself
in the lake says the prince hell never
be able to survive the loss of okeefe
they were partners in crime for many years
and okeefes ghost will hant him until
he makes away with hisself-you can
gamble on that
  just then the bandmaster stands up
rather unsteadily and says he-
  vot iss the matter mil playin a dirge
for dot dead man alretty
  thats a splendid idea okeefe was
fond of music
well sor the band which was
pretty well soused as you might
say played somethin slow and sad-
like andit affected their hearers so that
some of them had to go outside to hide
their feelins but the prince spoiled
it all by ordering drinks and then they
missed me degraw came behind the bar
and says he-
  and what do you there he asks
  they say hes apt to come back for me
says i sor could i go to my room
shucks that cheap irish loafer that
imitation barroom scrapper he wont
have the sand to come within five miles
of me id bore him as full of holes as a
swiss cheese says degraw
  with l hat i looks up and there stands
otoole glaring down through the window
i he sheriff yelled and everybody rushed
outside i stood up and grabbed the
pistol just as he leaps into the room sor
 was that scared  points the gun straight
at his chest and fires but he never turns
a hair i never fired a pistol before in my
life and  expected to see him drop at my
feet but instead he steps up and says
youd do better work with a brick
gimme a drink you poor boob
  i drops the gun and hands him the bottle
and there he stood drinkin out of it when
the gang rushes back
  boys i give up he sings out im
through im afraid of the dark out there
and the willies are chasin me okeefes
spook all pale and wavin blue flames
follows me about and calls me a four-
flushin piker string me up and end my
misery
  my word sor i was flabbergasted
okeefes spook said the prince
that man hasnt been croaked long
enough to have a spook the human jack-
rabbit never had soul enough to get an
x-ray of a spook that would show three
feet away for that matter weve been
prancin around here for two hours without
overhauling the corpse how do we know
that he is dead at all at all
  oh hes croaked all right says the
artist chap rigor mortis and alco-
holic decomposition set in long ago he
smells like sour mash hes laid there
under that fur cape without twit chin since
ten oclock but let the murderer lay his
hand on the dead body and make a test
that will prove it
  never never groaned the murderer
shrink in back and takin a pull on the
bottle let this bartender do it
nonsense says the prince theres
one sure test tickle the stiff just under
the first rib if he moves theres life in him 
well sor just as one of them stepped
toward the corpse it drew up its legs over
its stomach my flesh crept and my
hair stood up then i saw that it was
protectin itself against the expected
hi
the wagon-box fight

tickling but before i could realize what it
meant okeefe throws off the fur cape and
gets up on his feet says he
  you-fools must think this is a five-
reel film production gimme a drink
quick my - my mouth tastes like
the subway and my belly is so sore from
holdin in the laughs that i feel as if i had
appendicitis
iisi jarvis paused a moment before
 he made the final confession of his
tale
  then sor it came to me in a flash that
they had been spoofin me all along they
were blank cartridges in the pistols
  and then jarvis you went over the top
and tried to clean out the bunch
  i did that sor i handed that otoole
desperaydo one that jolted him a good bit
but they overpowered me they told me
that one poke proved my courage and theyr
all shook hands with me and the band
played the wearinof the green and sor
i think we got a bit drunk sor but how
did you happen to guess what i did sor
  i didnt guess jarvis i was there
that night i am the artist chap and
harry mack the prince was ray brother
i fell in the lake while trying to get a peep
at your face man man if i should
laugh now as we laughed that night id
crack something ah that was long long

off their spoofin the minute they came
and them two the worst of all sor did
the landlord play the trick on me sor
never jarvis he was no jokesmith

all on the spur of the moment for those were
gifted improvisers and a hint to otoole
and okeefe was enough
  well axmyway i went back to old ire-
land three days after and thats all i ever
see of the states sor
the wagon-box fight
       by e a brininstool
uquestionably the greatest
battle between white men and
indians ever fought in the west-
taking into consideration the
small number of whites and the awful
death-toll they inflicted-was what is
known historically as the wagon-box
fight of august   which occurred
some twenty miles southeast of the present
city of sheridan wyoming and about six
miles from old fort phil kearney at that
time one of the important military posts
on the new wagon road which had been
opened by the government to bozeman
montana in this fight thirty-two sol-
diers and civilian wood-choppers stationed
at the fort were surrounded in a corral
made of the beds of the wagons used in
transporting logs to the fort by three
thousand sioux warriors under command
of chief red cloud and after a most
terrific engagement lasting from about
seven in the morning until two or three
in the afternoon were relieved by a de-
tachment from the fort
  the most amazing part of this fight is
the fact that the whites lost but three men
killed and four or five wounded while the
indian loss as acknowledged some years
later by red cloud and verified from
other indian sources was  this
was the first real battle between whites and
indians in which breech-loading rifles were
used by the former against the bows and
arrows and old-fashioned firearms of the
savages
  in anticipation of a battle during the
process of cutting and transporting logs
to the fort to finish needed buildings the
boxes from fourteen wagons had been
removed and arranged in a semicircle on
the level plain a short distance from where

adventure
the wood-choppers were at work being
guarded at their task by soldiers from the
fort several extra rifles apiece and ten
thousand rounds of ammunition were two
of the reasons for the awful slaughter
inflicted by the soldiers and wood-
choppers on the morning of august 
 the wood-choppers were barely at
their task when indians by the hundreds
swarmed from the ravines and gullies
where the pine logs were being cut
  of the number at work thirty-two man-
aged to retreat in safety to the wagon-box
corral where under the command of capt
j w powell and lieut john -jenness
preparations for a stubborn light were im-
mediately begun although their enemies
outnumbered them nearly a hundred to one
  confident of being able to overwhelm
the little party chief red cloud devoted
some little time to preparations for the
battle then a force of five hundred of
his leading warriors mounted on their war-
ponies detached themselves from the main
command and started for the little corral
out on the level plain whooping and yell-
ing on they came with ponies on the run
not a shot was fired from the corral until
the horde of screeching savages were within
fifty yards when a perfect sheet of flame
ringed the corral and a rain of bullets was
poured into the advancing ranks
  the firing was not one solid volley and
then silence as the indians had anticipated
but it was a steady and persistent stream
of fire which mowed them down in scores
the astonished braves could not under-
stand the rapidity of the firing knowing
nothing of the new breech-loading arms
which had been supplied to the soldiers
but a very few days before in the front
of lhe corral where the brunt of the charge
had been met horses and men were cut
down as by some giant mowing-machine
  dazed and chagrined by the failure of
the first charge the sioux fled back out
of range of those deadly rifles where red
cloud consulted with other chiefs upon
another plan seven hundred indians were
ordered to prepare themselves as a skirmish-
ing party they were led by the great
red clouds nephew in person support-
ing them and intended to constitute the
main attack were the whole remaining body
numbering nearly two thousand warriors
  in the first attack but one of the whites
was killed and two severely wounded
again the indians advanced and again the
fire belched forth from the corral mowing
down the savages in scores the indians
could not account for the sustained and
frightful fire
  the white man must have made bad
medicine they said afterward
  charge after charge w-as made on the
heroic little band huddled within their
miniature fort but each w-as successfully
repulsed the firing was heard at the
fort and relief was sent before wrhich the
indians retreated they had got enough
today but three men are known to be
alive who took part in that most remark-
able battle they are sergt sara s
gibson of omaha nebraska frederick
claus of lincoln nebraska and m litt-
man of st louis
  some liistorians have contended that the
wagon-boxes were lined with boiler iron
which accounted for the small loss suffered
by the whites but sergt gibson has in-
formed the writer that such is not the case
  they were the ordinary wagon-boxes
made out of inch pine boards said gibson
most of the bullets fired by the sioux
splintered the tops of the boxes to slivers
but our loss was slight compared to that
which we inflicted
  in reminiscing regarding the wagon-box
fight about s on the pine ridge reser-
vation chief red cloud then an old man
said he went into the fight with over three
thousand braves and lost over half he
was asked if he meant that over fifteen
hundred were killed the old chief sorrow-
fully shook his head and replied
  i lost them they never fought again
author of tfic vengeance of rooney an hour etc
it was a barbarously decorated big
room in the casa of datto parang
the casa stood on the west coast of
tawi tawi away down under the
pale rays of the southern cross
  hanging against the walls of the room on
all sides were coarse-woven gorgeously
colored tapestries and fastened to them
were spears shields bolos and krises of
various designs also there was a dried
and shriveled head or two-silent grue-
some proof of parangs personal prowess as a
warrior the furniture consisted of a
number of chairs made of some hard red-
dish wood crudely but fantastically car-
ved in the center of the room was a
long table of pure ebony its top polished
to a mirror finish at one side of the
table sat the datto and opposite him was
crawson white man renegade commander-
in-chief of the datto s motley but vicious
army
  on the table between them stood a teak-
wood box which was about ten inches long
six by six bound with heavy iron bands and
secured with six powerful locks-two on
either side and one at each end there
were also iron rings for handles at each end
the box had no hinges to open it the
smooth snug-fitting lid was merely lifted off
after all six locks had been unfastened
  parang produced a ring containing six
keys unlocked each of the locks lifted off
the lid and burrowed his hand wrist-deep
into the contents five hundred thousand
dollars in jewels there were diamonds
rubies pearls emeralds and a plentiful
mixture of the other and less noted kinds

the datto lifted his hand palm up and
slowly spread his fingers there followed a
shower like the falling of varigated hail and
the jewels dropped back into the box
scintillating flashing every color of the
rainbow
  crawson gazed at the little pebbles
hungrily as they fell through the dattos
fingers sparkling and flashing signals of
ease of creature comfort five hundred
thousand dollars in portable disposable
form in sydney in paris with that box
-what a life crawson had not been in
sydney or in paris but he had imagination
and gave it free rein
  parangs small black eyes glowed fanat-
ically here indeed was wealth to buy
many guns and more bullets with which to
slay the hated christians the datto plan-
ned to unite the entire moro forces and
sweep the archipelago from sulu to luzon
to drive out the americans and enslave all
christian natives crawson had made him
believe it possible
  in fact it was crawson who had origi-
nated the idea of accumulating a fund to
buy arms and ammunition shortly after he
had established himself as commander of
the dattos army he laid before the latter his
plan for a systematic session of looting to
be perpetrated in mindanao the proceeds of
these incursions to be saved until the sum
reached a total of five hundred thousand
dollars
  but sciior protested the datto all of
the rice and bullocks and potatoes in tawi
tawi and mindanao put together are not
worth five hundred thousand dollars

adventure
  thats just the trouble with you dal to
you think only of such cheap trash as rice
and bullocks and potatoes forget that
stuff and go after the big game now
these catholic churches over iu mindanao
have gold candlesticks and gold cups they
call chalices and the padres have got all
kinds of gold money and precious stones
what we want to do is to rig up some good
strong double outriggers that will stand a
trip from here to the coast of mindanao go
over in small parties and relieve these
church gentlemen of their wealth they
took it from the poor dev ils over there and
its past time that somebody took it from
them
  and another thing datto any of these
filibusters wholl be willing to run guns in
here to us wont be willing to accept spanish
money or gold candlesticks either one
would create suspicion against them but
convert everything into jewels-diamonds
rubies pearls and the like-and theyll take
those fast enough
  the datto had fallen in readily enough
with both ideas the outriggers were
built and the business of robbing churches
and almost everything else was promptly
begun the results were highly pleasing
to crawson and datto parang but deeply
distressing to numerous padres the hard
part however for crawson had been to
keep parang from buying guns in small
quantities and thus preventing the accumu-
lation from reaching the intended amount
  but finally he convinced the datto that
it was safer to take one big chance of landing
all the guns and ammunition at one time
than to risk a number of small shipments
thus the wealth now in hand had reached
the five-hundred-thousand-dollar mark
there was no excuse for further delay in
fact crawson did not wish to delay any
longer the time had come to gather the
fruit of his labor and his planning
  the little box had been brought out on
this particular occasion to put into it more
gems-the result of the last raid craw-son
drew from his pocket a small leather bag
and poured its contents into the box
parang closed and locked it rose and took
it into an adjoining room-his owti sleeping-
apartment
  crawson wished that he knew the exact
hiding-place for the box but several subtle
attempts to find out had failed
  when the datto returned crawson looked
at his watch pleaded fatigue and said he
wished to retire for the night
  as a rule crawson chose to sleep in his
tent even when at headquarters however
there was always a sleeping-apartment
ready for him in the dattos casa and to-
night he said that he preferred a soft bed
so the datto called a slave who lighted a
large brass lamp and stood waiting to lead
the way to crawsons apartment
  the white man rose and starled to follow
the servant then he stopped suddenly as if
he had just thought of something
  ah he said  must not forget my
little courtesy
  he opened his cigaret case and studied
its contents closely for a moment then
he carefully selected a cigaret placed it be-
tween the datlos lips and held out a lighted
match this was a custom which crawson
had established early in his associations
with datto parang
  it is a token of my loyalty he told the
datto on that first occasion
  the mohammedan had been much flat-
tered and since that lime they had never
parted until the little ceremony was per-
formed
  when he reached his room crawson
went to bed but not to sleep he did not
want to sleep besides his nerves were
taut and he fought continually to suppress
excitement finauy he lit a cigaret it
was a native production and he threw it
away in disgust found a brown paper and
some american tobacco and rolled a
smoke then he settled back and in the
pages of a six-months-old magazine tried
to forget the passing of time nevertheless
he looked at his watch often and at last the
hands pointed to one oclock he judged
that the time for his work had arrived
  he arose dressed in an outfit of native
clothes instead of his uniform and buckled
about his waist a belt to which hung two
large revolvers and one small kris the
belt contained one hundred cartridges
crawson made his way without a sound
back to the big room and with his left
hand gently tried the door to parangs
bedroom while his right hand gripped the
hilt of the small kris he was not sure that
parang was asleep and in case he was dis-
covered a pistol-shot was out of the
question
  crawson found that the door w-as fastened
on the inside he waited breathlessly his
rescued

 ears strained for a sound he could
 hear his watch tick off the seconds a
 minute passed no sound came then he
 carefully stuck the kris through the split-
 wattled door just below the wooden latch
 which fastened it on the inside next he
  pressed down on the handle of the kris thus
 lifting the latch with the blade the
 door opened readily and crawson stepped
 in
  a lamp was still burning parang was
 stretched on his bed crosswise dead for the
 time being his clothes still on crawsons
 cigaret had fulfilled its purpose another
 detail of his plan had worked out as cal-
 culated this was encouragement
   the next step was to find the teak-wood
 box he looked about the room the
 box was not in sight the walls of the
 house were split-wattled bamboo and
 thatched on the outside there was no
 chance of its being hidden there a thor-
 ough investigation of the furniture re-
 vealed nothing and crawson grew anxious
 that the treasure was somewhere in the
 room he was positive for more than once he
 had seen parang carry it there and he
 knew that the datto was too well acquainted
 with moro nature to have intrusted the box
 to any one
   still apparently his search had already
 eliminated every possible hiding-place
 no there was one other happy thought
 why had it taken so long to come
   on his hands and knees crawson began
 going over the floor at last he moved the
 foot-mat beside parangs bed and there his
 search ended a square panel had been
 cut out of the floor and a sort of trap-door
 made crawson raised the door lifted
 out the box and started to leave the room
 then he thought of the six keys he
 found them in the pocket of parangs tunic
 outside of the casa crawson
 walked to a small shabby tent and
  rapped on the closed flap a few
 seconds passed and then two husky moros
 emerged from the tent and saluted in soldier
 fashion their bare bronze shoulders glist-
 ening under the full moon these were the
 white mans personal servants
   chow ordered crawson enough
 for two days
   the two servants were accustomed to
 sudden trips started in the middle of the
 night they were used to the demand for
chow and were always prepared to produce
it quickly silently the two disappeared
and in a few minutes returned with food for
a two days journey
  to the boats pronto crawson ordered
and fell in behind them
  at the beach crawson pointed to a large
outrigger the moros clambered aboard
and took their places at the oars the
white man followed and as he seated him-
self in the stern of the boat he saw one of
the moros make a slight gesture toward the
box also he noted that tjie two were
whispering furtively to each other he
wondered if some rumor of the box and its
treasure had reached them it was pos-
sible yes even probable secrets were
hard to keep at any rate it was plain that
his servants were suspicious and crawson
decided that the sooner he asserted himself
the better he whipped out one of his
revolvers and said curtly
  im leaving this-country of yours
and you two may as well know it now as any
time shove off and the first one that
makes a sound is meat for the sharks
  for half an hour the men rowed vigor-
ously under the stimulus of the white mans
gun then he ordered a halt and called
one of them over to him
  take off that bolo he said and throw
it into the sea now have you got any
more knives stored away about you
  no senor answered the moro
  turn your back said crawson and
ill soon find out
  when the mans back was turned craw-
son pressed the muzzle of his revolver
against the brown neck just below the ear
and with his left hand felt around the waist-
band of the fellows breech-clout and
brought out a wavey little double-edged
kris
  i thought so said the white man and
threw the thing overboard after its larger
brother
  now go back and take your place at the
oar he ordered
  when the first servant was seated craw-
son called the other one over and searched
him also
  now said crawson if i turn my back
for the fifth part of a second you hombres
wont be able to whiz a knife into me and
dont forget to put some muscle behind
them oars if you do i might get careless
with these six-shooters
ioo
adventure
  after that he settled back to guard the
two men who were sending the boat north-
ward with long sweeping strokes
  it was a trip of about one hundred and
ninety mijes that crawson was intending
to make and he figured that he could force
the two moros to row that distance in
seventy-two hours he had planned to
run north from tawi tawi until he passed
zamboanga city which is at the southern
end of the zamboanga peninsula
  then he proposed to change his course
east and pick up the coast of mindanao off
san ramon which is about twenty miles
north of zamboanga city here he would
land among the peaceable subanos where
there were no moros and where he was
reasonably sure there would be no troops
he could not afford to meet any soldiers-or
any white people at all for that matter
he did not know just how much the author-
ities knew about his raids in mindanao or
just how badly he might be wanted
  after landing he intended to go into the
jungle near san ramon tie the moros hand
and foot and hold them prisoners there
in the jungle he would remain until he
could learn of some steamer that was
sailing from zamboanga to australia
then he would turn his prisoners loose at
the last minute slip down in the night and
get aboard the ship and the new life
would begin
  it was a clear night the moon silvered
the smooth green water and the arms of
the outrigger hissed as they skimmed
lightly along the surface
  with his gun in his right hand and the
tiller in his left crawson held his boat to the
north far astern of him low in the sky
hung the southern cross symbolic of the
tropics of adventure at his feet lay five
hundred thousand dollars-not in humdrum
commonplace money but in clean pulse-
stirring jewels the blood coursed hotly
through his veins he felt the thrill of
lawlessness-of piracy he had defied all
conventions alj law he liad set aside all
scruples and taken for himself what he
wanted out of the wealth of the world
and now he rode a very monarch on the
broad sea forcing by sheer power two hu-
man beings to do his absolute will thus in
exhilaration of possession crawson coaxed
and threatened and drove the moros on to
greater effort he knew that daylight
would bring discovery and that the land
and the sea would then be searched in all
directions
  the precious hours from -the time
when crawson left the beach-till daylight
sped id too swiftly when day dawned
the two moros were extremely tired and
crawsons direst threats accompanied by
an occasional blow failed to speed up the
swing of their oars to make the prospect
less rosy black clouds were gathering in the
heavens and the wind was steadily increas-
ing about eleven oclock in the morning
crawson saw two outriggers rise on the
crest of a long sw-ell well astern of him
there were at least a dozen men in each of
the boats crawson had expected to be
pursued but he hardly thought they would
have overtaken him so soon at first he
was inclined to doubt that they were pur-
suers but any question as to who they
were was promptly settled by a puff of
white smoke which rose from one of the
oncoming boats and a mauser bullet which
came whining across the water
  crawson knew that it was no miracle
that the moros should have picked up his
course so easily had he gone in any other
direction they would have sighted him just
as quickly for these were only two of a
dozen boats sent out in fan-shape formation
so as to cover the entire surface for miles
around the wrhite man now prayed for
the storm which he had so recently dreaded
it would at least put an end to the firing and
perhaps give him a chance to elude the
a loros
  the pursuers wrere pulling nowr with all
their might and with the strength of their
many oars they were gaining fast it
seemed but a question of time until the
erstwhile general would be overhauled and
taken prisoner or else shot by his own sol-
diers crawson realized that he must do
some tiling-that in some wav he must
drive the two men in his owti boat on to
greater effort he fired two shots in quick
succession into the gunwales of the boat
one shot at the elbow of each of the moros
  pull he shouted pull or the next
will lodge in your hides
the terror of the shots and the
fierceness of crawsons voice sent
fear to their hearts they forgot
their fatigue leaned far forward and then
bent their oars with long backward sweeps
the boat shot out with doubled speed and
rescued
ioi
the pursuers ceased to gain for a short time
but the exertion that crawsons men had
been driven to was short-lived it was be-
yond their powers to keep it up
  in the meantime the waves were rapidly
rising for the wind which had been blowing
briskly from the northwest suddenly shifted
to the southwest with increased force
and now instead of being compelled to
pull partly against the wind crawson had
both wind and water at his back driving
him along his proper course faster than
twenty oars could have done but the
same wind which drove his boat up the
watery mountains and down across the
seething valleys did the same for his pur-
suers nevertheless crawson welcomed
the storm which by now had turned the
sky to a black shroud and the sea to a
roaring tearing monster
  by this time the two oarsmen had let
their oars go and turned all their attention
to the business of staying in the boat and
the little box was bouncing around in a way
that was alarming crawson sheathed
his revolver-there was no danger from his
servants just then-and knelt astride the til-
ler thus holding the boat on its course
then he felt under the seat and found a
short coil of rope this he ran through the
iron handles of the box and bound it to his
shoulders
  often now as the frail craft scurried up
the green wall of some gigantic billow
crawson felt sure that it would pitch
backward bottom up and be crushed by
the great rolling mass of water immediately
behind still the boat continued to climb
up the sheer green banks its arms out-
spread like some monstrous spider and
crawson would lean to the bottom lest he
fall out backward
  then when the little shell would shoot
over a curving ridge and cling there for a
breathless second crawson was transported
to raptures in those few brief moments
he would live ages at the pinnacle of life
and yet again as the stinging salt spray
whipped his face and the boat raced down
at a speed which no engine could propel and
the combing crests of the waves lapped out
at him like hungry tongues crawson
shouted in joy and defiance at the wild
whirling elements about him but through
it all he never forgot to use his tiller with
that he kept the stern of his boat to the
wind-kept it from turning broadside and
being swamped it was a glorious battle
the pigmy man outwitting and overriding
limitless power
  so filled was crawsons mind with sen-
sations that he had forgotten he was not
alone until reminded by the sight of his two
servants diving overboard he realized
that only some imminent danger could have
driven them to leave the boat and brave
such a boiling tumult so he began
scanning the horizon as closely as possi-
ble for an explanation of this sudden rash-
ness
  first he eyed the boat up and down for a
leak but there was none there was no
water in the bottom to speak of-merely
what had splashed aboard in the form of
spray  the little craft was riding the waves
buoy antly at that instant the boat was
on the crest of a towering billow and craw-
son was in a position to see much of the
watery space about him but the two ser-
vants were not in sight doubtless they
had been carried down
  from the elevation of its position the
little craft dived to the seemingly bottom-
less depth of a watery chasm then on
the crest of the next wave crawson learned
why his oarsmen had chosen to go over-
board scarcely had he seen it when his
boat rushing down the opposite side of the
great wave with a scud-driving speed
crashed upon the reef and shattered to
splinters the moros had feared this
more than the raging water
  there was a swirl of water about craw-
sons ears an impression of tangled rafts
of kindling wood and then he found himself
clinging to the reef although the sharp
coral cut his hands terribly instinctively
half-consciously he freed one hand and
reached up to his shoulder the box was
still there intact
  taking conditions as they were the thing
of most and immediate importance was to
find some sort of shelter from the tremen-
dous weight of onrushing water unless he
did this crawson knew that he would soon
be beaten insensible he dragged himself
up and crawled slowly over the reef
holding grimly with hands and feet to the
irregular surface to brace his body against
the ever-surging water thus he worked
his way slowly and painfully to the western
edge of the reef once there he crawled
down the rough side and found a ledge that
afforded him a foothold the ledge was
                                                                                               
	adventure
several feet below the surface and stand-
ing on this with more than half of his body
under water and clinging to the edge of the
reef with both hands he was partially pro-
tected from the storm-driven water which
broke and spent most of its force on the
opposite side
  crawson remained clinging here for what
seemed to him an unendurable length of
time his shoulders ached from the weight
of the box which had become to him not a
thing of pounds but of tons his fingers
were cramped and bleeding from holding to
the ledge and he felt that he had been hold-
ing on there since the first ray of the first
dawn but in reality it was less than an
hour for the storm broke quickly as they
so often do in tropical waters the clouds
melted and the siui shone forth dazzling
searing
  as soon as the commotion of the water
began to subside crawson left his perch
on the ledge and drew himself up to the
surface of the reef the seas were still
running high but the force was no longer
behind them crawson was able to stand
up and survey his surroundings
h almost the first thing he saw was
a owt flat speck of land it was a
mere dot on the face of lhe ocean
he could see across it there were no
inhabitants no growth-just a bare bald
sand-dune with a rocky formation at one
end completely surrounded by a coral
reef yet to crawson it was a paradise
an oasis in the desert he judged the
island to be about a mile from the reef and
even in his present condition he felt equal
to a swim of that distance
  the seas were fast getting down to nor-
mal crawson scanned the horizon in
search of the moros they were not to be
seen the white man was glad for this
he might be able to swim a mile but he
was in no shape for an encounter with a
gang of moros moreover he had no
weapon except his two hands with which to
defend himself when his boat had been
wrecked his belt was torn off in some way
and with it went his dagger his revolvers
and ammunition
  crawson sat down and took off his shoes
and trousers lied the shoes together and
swung them over his neck stuffed the trousers
in between his back and the jewel box
slipped into the water and struck out for
the island with a long steady stroke that he
knew- he would be able to maintain
  as soon as he reached the island which
he judged to be about five miles in circum-
ference crawson began going over it in the
hope of finding fresh water but much to
his dismay there was not a drop to be
found but he did come upon numerous
birds some of the more timid ones flew a
little away at his approach but most of
them merely waddled to one side as he
came near he recognized them for gun-
nies and terns and by the great quantities
of eggs strewn on the sand he knew they
were there for the purpose of breeding
this then solved the problem of food
however crawsons thirst was greater
than his hunger just then so he determined
to look again for water before trying lhe
eggs
  while pursuing his search for water
crawson discovered the hull of an old
wreck a small sailing craft it was piled
on the beach and half buried in the sand
indicating that it had been wrecked years
before he ripped an oaken plank from the
side of the old hull broke it at a convenient
length went back about two hundred yards
from the beach and began to dig he had
expected that he would have to try in many
places but to his surprize water began to
bubble up through the sand when he had
dug down less than five feet
  crawson cupped his hands and tasted it
it was cool and fresh-not the slightest
tinge of salt he thought it a miracle that
he had struck water al the first place he
tried later he was to learn that he could
strike water anywhere on the island as soon
as he dug down to the level of the oceans
surface it was merely the ocean water
that seeped through the sand and was fil-
tered in the process
  when crawson had slaked his thirst at
the little well of his own making his incen-
tive for further exertion was removed
for the present at least his hunger was
forgotten in the crying need of his body-
his entire body from molecule to muscle-
for relaxation rest
  the ancient schooner had come on to the
beach at the north side of the island with its
nose pointing southward therefore as
the time was afternoon the western side of
it offered a small space of shade crawson
strelched out in the coolness of this spot
and gave himself up to slumber-that
rescued

slumber which is absolute oblivion the
oblivion that comes to the utterly ex-
hausted
  crawson was aroused some hours later
by the lapping of cool water about his body
the waves had actually reached the height
of his neck it was high tide he crawled
out of the thin sheet of rising and receding
water and stood up once more fresh in-
vigorated hungry ready for the eggs
  he scooped out a slight depression in the
sand placed in it half a dozen eggs and
covered them with more sand then he
ripped a plank from the old wreck and with
a heavy chunk of coral broke it into fine
splinters and piled them over the eggs
ready to fire but when he drew from his
pocket a supposedly waterproof match-box
he found that his matches were totally
dissolved by water however this did not
daunt crawson nor did he mean that he
would eat his eggs raw he looked around
for a while and found some dry grass a few
scrawny turfs of which grew on the island
he took some of the grass between his
hands and ground it into fine chaff then
over the chaff he held two stones and struck
them together a spark fell the chaff
ignited this he set to the splinters and
soon the eggs were roasted
  when crawson finished eating it was
about an hour before sunset and the day
was exceptionally clear looking off to the
east in the hazy distance he could distin-
guish the dim shape of a great mountain
this he knew was on the island of jolo
no other island so near lifted its peak to
that height and by his proximity to jolo
crawson knew that he was marooned on
one of the many nameless uncharted islands
that are a part of the sulu archipelago
  to the west of him he could see another
island which was apparently about five
miles away this island was larger and had
a much greater elevation than the one on
which he was located also it appeared to
have a considerable growth of coco-palms
these trees interested crawson a great deal
if he could only get to the other island he
would find some way of making these tall
straight spires into a raft he knew that
ships never came into that labyrinth of
coral reefs so his one hope of getting to the
mainland was a raft of some sort
  at first crawson had thought to con-
struct a raft out of timber from the old
wreck but half an hours consideration of
this project proved it impractical any
raft that he could rig out with boards and
cross-beams would be too light and too frail
for a hundred-mile sea voyage on the
other hand a raft of heavy logs would not
be so easily capsized
  as crawson sat thinking these things
over twilight effaced the gold of the sunset
a myriad stars dotted the sky cold pale
moonbeams fell like shattered lances on the
dark bosom of the ocean a mating bird
called sleepily to its loved one and the
sound blended and harmonized with the
dull boom of the waves on the distant reef
then at last the castaway lulled by the
balmy salt air threw aside his problems
and fell asleep
  crawson spent the next morning working
the roof off the galley of the old hull he
had nothing but a chunk of coral and a
length of cross-beam to work with and it
was a tedious job but he finally pried the
thing off in good condition it made a
flimsy raft one that he would never dare the
sea with but he thought he could get to
the other island on it however he de-
cided not to make the trip for several days
to come if there were any moros-his
late pursuers-marooned over there they
would probably rig up a raft and either
start for tawi tawi or come looking for
him in the next day or two
it was noon when crawson com-
pleted his task with the galley roof
and he was again hungry he
roasted more eggs and was much annoyed to
find upon peeling the shells off that two of
them were exceedingly strong and that one
had in it a half-hatched bird he was al-
ready beginning to feel the w-ant of variety
in food and the sight of a half-hatched bird
in his dinner did not increase his relish for
a straight egg diet crawson determined
that it should not happen again he found
a piece of board the one he had used to dig
the well and with it drew a large circle in
the sand and moved every egg out of the
circle he knew then that the eggs he
would find in this circle for the next few
days would be fresh
  three days passed no moros showed
and crawson decided that he wtould risk a
trip to the other island he buried his box
of jewels deep under the lee of the old hull
if the moros were on the other island he
had no intention of carrying the treasure

adventure
over to them then when the tide came in
and washed away all traces of his digging he
rolled his clothes into a small bundle made
them secure on the raft took a board of con-
venient length and rowed out to a gap in
the reef worked his raft through and started
on liis perilous voyage
  he had not gone far before he noticed a
single sharp fin about two inches above the
water crawson did not need to look to
know what was beneath the fin it was a
long gray cigar-shaped thing-a man-
eater-slinking along with ghoulish stealth
just across from the little raft crawson
slapped the water loudly with the llat of his
paddle and for a few minutes the fin disap-
peared but soon it was back again
slinking along even closer than before
and so the man rowed on and so the silent
gray ghoul dogged his course that the
shark might attack crawson on his flimsy
raft was not altogether improbable and if
it did the result was certain-the raft
upset a flash of red jaws of gleaming teeth
and-the end but this ever present pos-
sibility did not greatly worry crawson
rather it made the situation interesting-
added zest to existence
  after about three hours the raft crossed a
slightly submerged reef and the shark disap-
peared a little more and crawson landed
a few minutes proved that there were no
moros on the island it was not a sand
formation like the island he had just left
but one of those humps of earth that have
been pushed up above water surface by
some subterianean upheaval having been
raised from the bed of the ocean the island
was fertile and its foliage rank there
were coconuts and bananas and nipa in
abundance also crawson found a spring
of clear fresh water bubbling through a
crevice in the side of a rock-walled cliff
after allowing himself the luxury of half a
dozen bananas and the milk from two half-
grown coconuts he set about the work of
constructing a raft
  first he gathered nipa and plaited it into
ihree-ply strands of about forty feet each
these he tied from tree to tree stretching
them tight and leaving them to dry
bundle alter bundle he plaited and strand
after strand he stretched among the trees
till he had more than twelve hundred feet of
nipa rope this work occupied the best
part of ten days and when it was finished
his next item was logs
  crawson had no tool to cut down and
trim trees so he searched out fallen logs-
not rotten ones but sound ones blown down
by typhoons naturally these logs were of
various lengths and ttget them all of one
length he rolled and dragged them to-
gether side by side the butt ends even
then he brought dry grass and branches
and built a fire across the logs where it
would bum them off evenly and at a proper
length then laying them in two tiers
crosswise and using the grass rope for
laslung he soon completed a much-roped
and fairly durable raft
  out of some small boughs and vines craw-
son constructed a sort of bin at the front
end of tlie raft and this he filled with coco-
nuts the milk of which would take the
place of water on the voyage building
the raft had taken altogether fifteen days
and during that time crawson had eaten
nothing but coconuts and bananas so
he was glad to set out for the sand island
again where he could eat eggs
  crawson started about ten oclock in the
morning but his raft was heavy broad-
ended and consequently hard to row he
was all day covering the five or six miles
between the islands
  shortly before sundown he made his raft
fast to the old wreck and immediately began
digging to see whether his treasure was still
safe he had spent some anxious nights
about that but now he found it just as he
had left it so he roasted himself a meal of
eggs and then placed several dozen more
under a large fire and left them to roast
during the night these were for th
voyage
the next morning crawson started
on his voyage to the small coast
town of san ramon for eight
days crawson rowed diligently stopping to
snatch a few hours of sleep only when
nature became too insistent to be denied
the end of the eighth day found him in a
bad way indeed for three days he had
not seen sun moon or stars he had com-
pletely lost all idea of direction day and
night hour and minute he dwelt on the
probability of his location where was he
was he going toward san ramon or out to
sea these questions reiterated them-
selves again and again they preyed on
his nerves panic seized him his muscles
were stiff and sore from rowing and his
day-dreams

hands blistered his mind was on the verge of
dissolution then at last nature came to
his relief and crawson slept
  there was a whistle shrill metallic it
seemed faintly to pierce dim invisible walls
wherein crawson was confined the whistle
died out but the walls had been pierced
there came the clang of bells crawson had
heard bells like that before where oh yes
to be sure-in the engine-room on a ship
thats where he had heard those bells
they were signals to the engineer
  the invisible walls around crawson were
shattered he now heard clearly a voice
of authority was giving commands but
where was he crawson where had he
come from how had he come to be here
so close to a ship and yet not on the ship
he opened his eyes a long blade of light
slanted down on him and revealed his raft
of logs coconuts piled at one end and water
all about ah yes he knew then he had
been lost at sea on a raft he had fallen
asleep and this was a ship come to rescue
him at last he would get off of the raft
and feel the comfort and certainty of know-
ing where he was
  the life-boat was alongside of his raft
crawsons jewel box as usual was roped to
his shoulders he scrambled to his hands
and knees and crawled stiffly to the edge of
the raft he was weak exhausted the
sailors helped him gently into their boat and
then aboard the ship
  hours later crawson awoke in a bunk in
the forecastle he moved and there was a
clank of chains his wrists and his ankles
were in irons crawson held up his man-
acled hands and demanded of the sailor
across from him
  wtiat the-does this mean
  it means that the skippers had a look
into that little teak-wood box responded
the sailor and hes decided that youre
crawson the fellow whos been leadin
moros and lootin down around zambo-
anga
  what right has this skipper got to be
nosing into my belongings snarled craw-
son
  say son grinned the other youre
aboard of a united states revenue cutter
crawson turned his back to the sailor
there was nothing more to be said

for three hours the snow had been
falling steadily the white blanket
that covered little brother moun-
tain and big brother mountain -
and the broad and thickly wooded valley
that lay between them-was five inches
deep in the center of the valley big
brother creek flowed merrily passing the
morgan-haley lumber companys logging
outfit and pouring its crystal waters into
laurel river some four miles below
  night had come supper was over at the
morgan-haley camp and the majority
of the timberjacks had deserted the big
and rough boarding-house for the commis-
sarys glowing cast-iron stove these were
stalwart and sunburned fellows all moun-
taineers and all dressed alike in laced boots
and broad hats blue flannel shirts and clay-
colored corduroys
  gideon ashford a big logger whose beard
was so black that his freshly-shaven face
had a bluish look had just begun a harangue
setting forth in his uncouth way the extraor-
dinary beauty of one miss nancy kirk-
land when an interrupting voice came from
the other side of the red-hot stove
  shet up with an icy snap when ye
aint got nothinto say say it
  humph grunted the impudent ash-
ford he was the bully and smart aleck
of the camp is that you lonesome
why i thought ye was asleep its got to
be that yere real sassy when howlin
jim aint around to keep ye quiet fust
thing ye know yell have some trouble
lonesome a-tellin grown folks to shet up
thatawayl
  his words carried a bite the man called
lonesome sat on a soap box with his lees
crossed and with his forearms resting on his
upper knee he was a tall and rangey
young man as hard as hickory and as lithe
as a panther and remarkably taciturn at
times-which of course had bred for him
his nickname for six months he had been
with the morgan-haley crew and still no-
body seemed to know any tiling about him
save howling jim baskin-unless it was old
nathan kirklands daughter nancy
  howling jim-he had a voice that would
have made a fog-horn blush and he used it
at every decent opportunity-had come to
the camp on big brother creek with lone-
some bentley he was at least thirty-five
and ten years older than bentley but
theirs had been a wonderfully tight friend-
ship for all of that
  lonesome did not favor ashford with a
reply a few of the onlooking timberjacks
snickered because they didnt know what
else to do ashford laughed outright at
that which he was pleased to think of as
the others discomfiture just then there
came to the ears of those in the commissary
a snatch of a foolish old song in the ringing
voice of howling jim who was leaving the
boarding-house for the big stove
im a-goin to live anyhow till i die-
anyhow anyhow till i die
  howlins a-comin grinned ashford
i reckon yell behave yerself now lone-
some
bentley stuck fast to his motto when
ye aint got nothin to say say it and was
howling jims pal

silent as baskin stepped into the com-
missary doorway he shook the snow from
his hat his broad shoulders and his boots
  hi men good evenin to ye any-
body seed anything o lonesome he shot
all in one breath at the crowd by the stove
  here the bully answered in tones
colored with ridicule pointing
  baskin closed the door behind him
walked smilingly over and halted beside
his pal something was wrong he saw at
once then he caught sight of the still
leering face of the bully and he understood
he stepped toward ashford folded his
arms across his chest and looked ashford
straight in the eye
  all right gid he said narrowly
keep it up youll git yores all right ef
yell jest keep it up it wont be me that
hands it to ye neither itll be lonesome
hisself  he shore carries a suprize package
in each paw and hell lay a wallopin on ye
that four hosses caint pull off
  gideon ashford laughed to save his face
so to speak as yet he had not fought
either howling jim or bentley they were to
him unknown quantities he found an
empty box close to lonesome and sat down
another minute and the commissary door
opened again this time a slender and
nicely-figured girl of not much more than
twenty came in snow particles glistened
like diamond chips on her pale-blue home-
knit and tasseled headgear and on her cheap
but warm imitation paisley shawl her
cheeks were as rosy as red apples from the
cold air and good health and her long brown
eyes were full of laughter twinkles
  smiling for no reason whatever she
walked across to the counter she paid
not the slightest notice to the score of log-
gers who had fallen as still as death at the
sight of her and who now watched her as if
she were the very last woman in the world
those big rugged men adored nancy
kirkland
  my dad aint got any tobaccy she
drawled softly to billy allison the clerk a
pale youth who hailed from the lowland
   allison gave her a tin of smoking tobacco
she put a little silver coin on the counter
and turned for the door
  lonesome bentleys gaze had been fast-
ened sternly and defiantly upon gideon
ashfords dark countenance from the mo-
ment of the girls coming asliford now
put his hands on his knees and was about
to go to his feet bentley tapped him
sharply on the arm
  set still said lonesome
 but-
  set still lonesome snapped
  ashford stared in amazement at having
his hand thus called then his face
clouded
  i got as good a right to go home with
her as you have
  no you aint bentleys low steely
voice cut him off you aint fit
  the girl was gone ashford rose and
his huge and hairy hands curled up into
fists bentley slipped to his feet without
any apparent effort
  you aint fit he reiterated any
man what lies and steals and drinks and
gambles aint fit to go with any decent
woman anywhere ive shore said it ef
you want to fight me about it go to it
ive took all o yore fim-makin and mouth-
in ill ever take ef you want to start
somethin wi me start it right now im
ready and a-waitin
  lonesomes face was pale save for a tiny
pink spot under the sunburn of either
cheek his eyes fairly sparkled he held
himself as tense as a coiled steel spring
the bully turned red and glanced with a
sickly grin toward the men who watched
and waited at bentleys elbows ashford
knew that he had to fight or else let the
outfit take it for granted that he was afraid
and that steel spring of a man who stood
before him dared him to so much as lift a
finger
  for a moment there was charged silence
it was broken by a silly little guffaw from
the lowland youth who held forth as com-
missary clerk and with that all the loggers
except the two belligerents themselves
joined in a roar of derisive laughter gid
ashford the fallen false god became still
redder he slumped back to his box took
paper and tobacco from his pocket and
nervously began to roll for himself a cigaret
  now that the thing was over howling
jim baskin turned and placed a hand
proudly on his pals shoulder to the sur-
prize of everybody lonesome bentley
threw howling jims hand off angrily
  never mind said lonesome
  baskin stared looked hurt stepped
slowly to the counter and leaned against
it rather heavily bentley gave the crest-
fallen erstwhile bully a look of contempt
io
adventure
and went alone toward the boarding-
house
  not long afterward the commissary crowd
began to thin out at closing time only
ashford and billy allison the clerk were
there and ashford watched young allison
keenly as he took the days gleanings from
the money-drawer and placed them in the
small iron safe
  the morgan-ilaley companys commis-
sary banked but once each month and these
deposits ran anywhere from four to eight
hundred dollars
hwhen lonesome bentley went
toward the boarding-house howling
jim followed him bentley did
not even look around until he had reached
the up-stairs sleeping-quarters of the crew
in which a big hanging oil lamp burned
dimly he gave baskin a glance that was
part scowl undressed without a word to his
former great crony and crept silently under
his blankets baskin followed suit and
for five minutes the two big man lay so still
there in their narrow beds within six feet
of each other that they seemed to be hardly
breathing
  then howling jim put the soft pedal on
his fog-horn voice and spoke
   lonesome
  no answer
  lonesome baskin pursued what is it
thats come between you and me
  never mind bentley said sharply
  and not another word could howling
jim get out of him that night
  howling jim found slumber forsaking
him as for lonesome neither did he go
to sleep readily his thoughts wouldnt
let him sleep those thoughts would have
been highly enlightening to baskin if only
he could have read them
  a week before lonesome bentley and
old nathan kirklands daughter who lived
with her parents in a big hewn-log cabin a
mile down big brother creek had quar-
reled bitterly-so bitterly in fact that
nancy had snapped off her engagement
to bentley as if it had been of no more
importance than a pie-crust lonesome
didnt know what they had quarreled about
and nancy didnt remember that is how it
goes when young human beings set other
young human beings up on pedestals as
models of perfection to worship them
the fault was humanitys rather than either
nancy kirklands or lonesome bentleys
individually no doubt and then-
  four days after the misunderstanding
on a bright sunday afternoon bentley had
decided that he would try to bridge the
abyss that yawned between him and his
sweetheart by going to her and confessing
that he had been a fool he had started for
her home and by the merest chance he had
come upon a scene that distressed him
sorely nancy and howling jim were
sitting together under a big poplar baskin
was holding her hand in his and she was
smiling at him in her very best way
then lonesome bentley had stolen back to
the camp with red-hot iron in his soul
  it seemed doubly hard to bear following
as it did on the heels of news to the effect
that the morgan-haley company looked
upon him-lonesome bentley as the very
best logger in the outfit bentley for all of
his taciturni ty was an ambitious young man
though they had lost some sleep
bentley and baskin sprang from
their beds at the first ringing blow
on the railroad iron triangle-gong which
hung just outside the kitchen door neither
had anything to say lonesome was the
first to get his clothing on he snatched
up his hat and hastened down to the dimly-
lighted back porch to bathe his face and his
hands
  he had no more than finished his washing
when howling jim addressed him from the
open doorway behind him
  the super wants to see ye lonesome
in his office said for me to tell ye by
grab thats good luck lonesome
  it was a fine bid for talk however
lonesome failed to nibble without a
single word bentley threw the icy-cold
towel to its peg on the wall and went toward
superintendent bradshaws little office on
the first floor he wondered just what
the good luck was a raise in wages
maybe
  the high light of the morgan-haley
camp was a big and bronzed elderly man
and he now sat before a small sheet-iron
stove which was glowing hot
  sit down bentley he said pointing
toward a cheap straight-back lonesome
dropped into the chair and bradshaw went
on nobody knows loggin better than
you know it bentley and ive recom-
mended you for the supers job here im
howling jims pal

leavin in just fifteen more days what
do you think of it can you hold it
   can read and write and figger enough
to keep the time-sheets lonesome said
softly more to him self than to bradshaw
perhaps shore i can hold it im
much obliged to ye brad
  honest appreciation beamed from his
eyes to be the superintendent of a log-
ging outfit that was his fondest dream but
one-and that one concerned nancy kirk-
land himself and a preacher he had
worked hard and for years in the attempt
to fit himself for a superintendents place
  bradshaw was about to speak again when
the door banged open to admit a miniature
hurricane of cold air and the youthful
figure of billy allison the commissary
clerk allison snapped the door shut be-
hind him and turned nervously to the two
men
  the commissarys front door was broken
open last night brad he announced in a
low and somewhat shaky voice whoever
it was used a peavy spike which was left
lying in the snow by the step but the
safe is all right and i didnt notice that
anything was gone
  bradshaw rose and so did bentley
then the superintendent beckoned to the
logger and the three of them went toward
the companys general store dawn was
just spreading its great rose-colored fan
upward from the crest of little brother
mountain the new day promised to be
clear and bright
  ajlison had already lighted the great oil
lamp that hung in the cenler of the big
long room and he and the other two quickly
looked over the stock so far as they were
able to see nothing had been stolen brad-
shaw walked back to the safe which stood
under the rear end of the counter it was
tightly locked
   sure this is all right billy he asked
  i havent looked inside frowned young
allison
  he hastened to the safe knelt before it
and within another minute swung open the
iron door then he shot to his feet
  its all gone-six hundred dollars he
exclaimed
  he had spoken correctly the six hun-
dred dollars in cash was not there bentley
pressed forward and leaned over the counter
  funny how that happened was his
drawling puzzled comment it must ha
been somebody that knowed the combina-
tion
   billy allison flashed a quick look toward
the hillman as at an accuser another
second and he was staring anxiously into
the superintendents bronzed face
  brad do you think- he began
  bradshaw interrupted
  the lad didnt do it lonesome he
said a trifle sharply and i didnt do it
and only us two and stapleton haley knows
the combination theres been a smooth
job pulled off here lonesome wed better
send to jones ville for the sheriff as soon as
possible but first maybe wed better see
whether theres any footprints leadin off
from the commissary eh
   bentley nodded and allison said eagerly
  yes the snow had stopped falling when
i closed last night and the robber couldnt
have gone anywhere except to the boarding-
house without his footprints giving him
away
  it was now light enough for them to see
even the track of a rabbit in the snow out-
side they walked a wide circle in the
clearing encompassing both the commissary
and the boarding-house without coming
upon a single footprint that couldnt be
easily accounted for which was con-
clusive proof that both the thief and the
money were still in camp
  when they had come to the commissarys
front doorway again bradshaw turned to
bentley with this
  one of the loggin-engines ought to
have some fire in it from yesterday lone-
some sneak over to the tracks and take
one dawn to jones ville and bring the
sheriff its down-grade nearly all the
way and you can raise steam as you go
hurry
   bentley ran to the tracks leaped aboard
one of the geared locomotives and loosed
the brakes the wheels began to turn
  the passing of an hour found him in the
foot-hills with a fair head of steam coming
on two hours after sunrise he was speak-
ing hastily with garrett henry the lanky
and serious blue-clad and broad-hatted
jonesville sheriff
it was not far from noontime
when the thundering staccato of
the small geared engines laboring
exhaust reached the ears of those who waited
at the morgan-hale camp on big brother
no
adventure
creek the crew had not gone to work in
the woods that day when at last the
little locomotive came to a halt in the camp
clearing garrett henry and bentley leaped
to the snowy ground and went to meet
superintendent bradshaw
  find out anything more growled the
officer
  bradshaw shook his head
  but the thief is still here and the money
too youve got a chance to show us how
smart you are all right i
  henry merely grunted the trio walked
on and entered the commissary which was
half filled with expectant timberjacks an
accommodating logger passed to the sheriff
the peavy that had been used in breaking
open the door henry looked it over
saw that it was only an ordinary implement
of its kind and put it down then he and
the superintendent and bentley went back
to the safe where the officer asked questions
soberly nodded a great deal and made a
superficial examination howling jim bas-
kin had followed them he idly dropped a
friendly hand to lonesome bentleys arm
and bentley threw it off as if it were a tiling
of unspeakable contamination
  somebody who knowed the combina-
tion decided henry
  it was not firmly replied bradshaw
  he himself had vouched for the honesty
of billy allison
  the sheriff began to strike matches that
he might better see into dark corners about
the safe suddenly he bent lower and
picked up a small square object that was
mostly white as he straightened to bring
it into better light-henrys eyes had never
been so good as his courage-a muscular
arm in corduroy shot over his shoulder and
seized it and before the passing of another
second the man to whom that arm belonged
was running like a race-horse for the door-
way
  it was howling jim who had by chance
been standing directly behind the officer
henry snatched his revolver from its
holster and called upon baskin to halt
half a dozen loggers stepped out of the
path of a possible bullet but howling
jim didnt stop he drove through the door-
way turned sharply to his left and out of
the sheriffs range of vision and made for
the near-by woods
  henry followed rapidly to the door-sill
and lonesome bentley was within a yard of
him when he reached it then garrett
henry leveled his revolver at the fleeing
figure baskin was running unwisely in a
straight line his brown-clad body making a
plain and almost stationary target against
the dead white of the snow but before
henry could fire bentley caught his right
shoulder and pulled him backward
  not that growled lonesome ashen-
faced and defiant you dont kill jim
baskin as easy as that
  when henry recovered himself baskin
was in the laurels and his escape assured
the officer now turned his attention to
bentley and there was a queer smile about
liis lips 
  pals eh
  mighty good pals- began lonesome
remembering nancy kirkland and breaking
off short
  for the fractional part of a minute he
looked away at nothing and when he
again turned his eyes toward the jonesvijle
sheriff he found himself staring straight
into the muzzle of a colt 
  its my duty to arrest you quietly said
garrett henry as a pardner in this
robbery
  lonesome bentley lived a long time in the
moment that followed tins announcement
in his minds eye he saw himself and nancy
-when he had asked her-when she had
agreed to marry him he saw himself and
nancy when they had quarreled over-he
didnt remember what and he saw howl-
ing jim his pal holding the girls hand
while she smiled her best smile into his
rugged face all of it-his bright hopes of
a superin tendency the robbery the accusa-
tion and all the rest of it-somehow tangled
him muddled him dazed him it seemed
unreal like a bad dream   
  the sheriff was speaking again-
  ill have to search you bentley
lonesome gave no sign that he had heard
as henry began to go through the pockets
of his prisoner nancy kirkland walked
smilingly into the commissary and turned
toward billy allison who now stood in his
place behind the counter
  i want some sug-
  that was as far as she ever got with it
for at that instant she caught sight of the
sheriff and lonesome bentley she went
immediately toward them
  what-whats that for she demanded
in a small thin voice
howling jims pal

  nobody answered the officer went on
with his slow and exceedingly careful search
of bentleys clothing lonesome looked
toward her smiled a tiny smile that seemed
desperate rather than merry and turned his
gaze aside gideon ashford wrho had been
watching the entire proceedings with tri-
umph written largely over his dark coun-
tenance touched nancy kirklands arm
and whispered-
   ill tell ye ef nobody else wont
  with several backward glances toward
bentjey the girl went with ashford to the
snow-covered ground outside there ash-
ford blew sparks from his home-made
cigaret and bent forward with this
  lonesome was cuniingern i thought he
was in low tones he was cunning
enough to open the commissary safe and
take out the six hundred dollars the was in
it and leave it locked up jest like it was
afore its shore a joke on him-he went
and brung the sheriff out and en got ar-
rested hisself
  he never done the robbin flared
nancy her brown eyes wide and sparkling
with resentment he wouldnt never do
it
  ashford shrugged his ox-like shoulders
forchunitly or onforchunitly ye dont
haf to take my word for it look here
through the open door he had seen
garrett henry unhook a safety-pin from
the upper edge of one of bentleys inside
coat pockets and take out a sizeable roll of
bank-notes ashford stepped hastily back
across the door-sill and nancy kirkland
followed with a lump in her throat with
one eye still on his prisoner henry counted
the money through after which he said to
bentley
six hundred i believe you told me
heres two hundred and ten you didnt
quite get your share did you lonesome
bentley was still ashen-faced still defiant
he straightened even a little more
 you mean that me and howlin
jim-
  i mean that you and howlin jim wrent
pardners in the deal hazarded the sheriff
better confess lonesome itll go easier
with you you know now just how did
you and howlin manage to get the money
without workin the combination
  charmed it-out drawled bentley in the
keenest sarcasm he brought his hands
up to the lapels of his corduroy coat and
with a forefinger rubbed his chin as if re-
flectively one of us stood on each side o
the safe howlin would say keeno
presto and id say prsto keeno and
purty soon the money jest tumbled right
out
  lonesome interrupted himself with a
master play he brought his two hands
downward and in one lightning-like move-
ment drove garrett henrys revolver fifteen
feet out of his grip and seized the roll of two
hundred and ten dollars in bank-notes
that money represented bentleys savings
for a year henry sprang to recover his
weapon and lonesome sprang for the out-
side as the sheriff ran toward the door
with his revolver in his hand a peavy came
hurtling before his legs tripping him
causing him to fall heavily when he rose
bentley was in the laurels
  seeing that lonesome too had escaped
him the fuming sheriff turned back and
stopped squarely before nancy kirkland
  you too he exclaimed you throwed
the peavy eh
  i shore did nancy admitted it
aint any secret whatre ye a-goin to do
about it
  henrys countenance was threatening-
and considering that mornings run of
luck for him one may hardly blame him
  ill arrest you as a-a accomplice thats
what im a-goin to do about it he said
  it was then that the camp rose and spoke
as a single man
   ill be danged ef ye do
  hemy faced the loggers-loggers who
adored nathan kirklands daughter
  whats that he demanded
  ill be danged ef ye do the camp spoke
yet again and it came a little more deter-
minedly than before
for the first hundred yards after he
had gained the snowy underbrush
bentleys thoughts wrere occupied
wholly with making good his escape no
man of his people had ever been to jail and
he wasnt going so long as he could avoid it
then seeing that he was in no immediate
danger of capture-the average down-south
sheriff knows the hopelessness of chasing a
mountaineer in the laurels-bentley began
to wonder what the small white object was
that garrett henry had found hong under
the safe soon he decided that he would
strike baskins trail in the snow overtake

adventure
him and find out also he would bring the-
lit tie matter of howling jims love-making
to nancy to a show-down
  fifteen minutes more and he had come
upon the footprints for which he had been
searching they led him up a bank of the
creek for a mile and then turned to the left
and were lost tin bare ground under a great
patch of hemlocks that stood so thickly
that their interlaced branches had caught
nearly all the snow that had fallen on them
howling jim had brought into effect a
woodsmans trick here in order to halt pos-
sible pursuit and lonesome suspected it at
once lonesome began to look for the
answer and soon his gaze rested upon a
spot at which the bare ground ran within
half a dozen yards of big brother creek
  bentley nodded understanding just as
baskin had done he backed off ran hard
and leaped over the few yards of snowy
ground landing somewhere near the middle
of die shallow stream
  he walked a mile up the stony little creek
before he found howling jims footprints
leading out of it the trail now took him
high on the side of little brother mountain
and then across an outstanding spur and
into a deep cove and he was not more than
half-way down the side of this cove when
darkness closed in upon liiin it was im-
possible of course for him to follow the
string of footprints farther before daylight
came again lonesome bentley halted
he was chagrined but by no means beaten
he was cold now his wet feet seemed
frozen and he stamped them on the ground
to help the circulation in them
  it was still very still and lonesome
stood and listened a few minutes later
he heard faintly coming from somewhere
in the bottom of the dark cove below him
a snatch of the foolish old song that howling
jim was so fond of singing in a sort of
abandon-
im a-goin to live anyhow till i die
  bentley stole softly onward downward
heading for a tiny point of llame that had
suddenly come to life in the woods
below
  howling jim baskin sat before a brush-
wood fire that he had just made at the
base of an overhanging cliff the fire made
dancing and grotesque shadows there in the
wild forest baskin held his wet feet in his
wet boots near the flames the muffled
sound of a twig being broken in the snow
caused him to look around quickly
  lonesome bentley seeming doubly stal-
wart and doubly serious in the flickering
firelight walked slowly up and stood
looking straight into the upturned and
smiling lace of his pal he had suffered
an almost overpowering wave of sudden
insensate anger it was his intention to de-
nounce howling jim as a black traitor to all
iriendship but in a seconds time there
flashed on the palimpsest of his brain scenes
from the good old days that he and baskin
had spent together scenes that pictured
little kindnesses confidences almost tender-
nesses
  so when lonesome finally spoke he said
only this-
  my feets about froze howlin
shore grinned baskin mine was
too by grab set down and warm em
have any trouble a-trackin me lone-
some  his voice was full of gladness
  not much bentley answered he
went on do ye reckon garrett henry
can foller us howlin
  him humph no by grab he
aint smart enough for that nor enough
used to the woods but-but they didnt
have nothin agin you lonesome
  bentley shrugged his shoulders
  no nothin-only-they arrested me as a
pardner in the robry thats all and they
sarched me and took my money thats all
but i got it back jail not for me
howlin ef anybody happens to name it
to ye
   he dragged up a flat stone turned the dry
side up sat down on it and put his feet over
the fire he was at the point of asking
howling jim what it was that he had
snatched from sheriff henrys hand when
baskin said slowly
  leather burns quick when its wtet
lonesome dont stick em too dost by
the way lonesome i got somethin here
what belongs to you
  from an inside coat pocket he drew an
opened and unstamped and somewhat
crumpled letter that had bentleys name in
a thin feminine scrawl on the envelope
and this he passed into the hands of his
pal
   i never read it o course he said
bentley took the missive and pocketed it
almost without looking at it he had been
careful of the few letters nancy had wtitten
howling jims pal

him and it amazed him to think that he
had lost one
  much obliged howlin he muttered
whered ye find it
  it was that said baskin that the
sheriff picked up from under the commissary
safe which i took from him and run with
i seed the ad-dress afore he did and i-i
knowed you never had no business back
there-and i thought-i thought you-
  i see cut in lonesome you thought
itd put me in bad about the safe-robbin
and you done it to clear me well it was a
fool thing to do for i never lost the letter
there im shore but-btit you-
  he broke off flushed slightly and began
to stir the fire with a boot-heel baskin
took up the thread that he had dropped
brad had told me jest afore he sent me
to ye this mornin lonesome that you was
might nigh shore to be the camps high-
boy purty soon and i was a-thinkin about
that when i took the letter and cut the
mustard for the timber itd ha spiled
the job for ye lonesome at least i
knowed ysee how much ye wanted to be
a super and as for me smiling his eyes
twinkling i-well it dont matter about
me cause im a-goin to live anyhow
till i die now aint 
  he looked back to the fire lonesome
turned his gaze hard upon the rugged profile
of his pal so this was the fellow whom he
had been about to denounce as a black
traitor to their friendship lonesome bent-
ley wished vaguely that he were another
man in order that he might kick himself
clean across little brother mountain
  you been mad at me lonesome
suddenly said howling jim without taking
his eyes from the glowing coals it was
partly that too what made me take the
letter and run with it i wisht i knowed
what you been mad at me about lone-
some
  bentley told him straightforwardly
  i seed you a-holdin nancys hand
there on the creek at the big poplar it
flew all over me like powder a-burnin
ive died a thousand times sence that one
minute howlin i reckon i aint got any
sense i reckon ye must ha had some good
reason for a-doin that but i shore couldnt
see it thataway till now
  howling jim sat up straight smiling
  i did have a good reason lonesome
he said that is i think i did by grab

ill leave it to you ysee i could easy tell
that somethin had come between you and
her and i was a-beggin her to take ye back
-and a-tellin her what a fine good young
man ye was and how much ye liked her
and how happy shed alius be with you
was-that-it gasped bentley
  god knows it was said baskin
  he went into his corduroy coat and came
back with something wrapped neatly in a
blue bandanna ever so carefully he took
the bandamia from it with his big and bun-
gling but wonderfully gentle hands and
passed it over to his pal lonesome took it
and held it up to the dancing firelight it
was an old-fashioned tintype picture of a
bareheaded and barefooted mountain lass
a smiling and pretty little mountain lass in
calico
  my sweetheart howling jim said
this is the only real secret ive ever kept
from you lonesome i never talk about it
where is she now
  under the snow
  after a minute of silence baskin went on
i aint never seed nobody else what
could take her place and i know i never
will thats why i go along a-singin and
a-whoopin through life jest to forgit
a-doin the best i can with the little that the
almighty put into my wothless cyarcass
for im mostly jest plain meat i reckon
it wasnt much o my business i know
lonesome for me to go to nancy and ax her
to take ye back but-well i thought
mebbe-
  its all right said lonesome i
thank ye for that howlin a man never
had a better pal an you howlin i shore
beg yer pardon for a bein so low-down mean
to ye heres the little picture
  he gave baskin the tintype and rose
he would go straight back to garrett
henry and tell him everything though it
surely meant jail for him baskin put the
picture into his pocket and he too went to
liis feet just then there came a most sur-
prizing addition to the little drama there
in the snowy wilderness
those two were not the only men
in that wild country who knew
woodcraft an eavesdropper who
had stationed himself on the cliff just
above had lost his perilous footing and he
now came hurtling down with a resounding
thump between lonesome bentley and
ii
adventure
howling jim baskin the newcomer car-
ried a revolver in a holster and he wore a
deputys shield on his coat it was gideon
ashford
  lonesome drew back a little as the big
brother reek camps erstwhile bully
turned a drawn and ashen face upward
  you was shore in a devil of a hurry to
get here gid he exclaimed mockingly
why couldnt ye jest ha walked in like a
decent white man
  baskin forgot himself and raised his fog-
horn voice
  drapped right down out o the blue sky
by grab do ye bring us any glad message
from the moon gid
  ashford struggled there on the ground
between them trying in vain to rise
 my laig- he mumbled oh-my
laig-
  by grab suddenly cried howling jim
ef his laig aint broke plumb in two might
nigh look there lonesome-its all
doubled up and a bone is a-stickin through
below his knee
  bentley stooped over and saw and he
shuddered in spite of himself
  its a-bleedin ashford said nerve-
lessly  its a-bleedin-lonesome you and
howlin git me to a doctor ef ye can
  wte can all right bentley replied
narrowly we could simply take ye to
the camp and super bradd shoot yedown
to jonesville on a loggin-inglne but you
know whats a-waitin for us at the camp
what-garrett henry
  yeuh garrett henry baskin nodded
and maybe a jail sentence or two ye
caint ax us to face it gid a-hatin jail like
we does but were sorry for ye count o
seein ve so bad hurt though it might ha
sarved ye jest about right for a-snoopin up
there on the clitt a-listenin to us open our
hearts to the bottom still were sorry for
ye gid
  im much obliged shore tremulously
growled ashford but you a-bein sorry
for me dont do me a dang bit o good
  ef i might ax drawled lonesome
pointing to the deputys shield that ashford
wore how comes it that yere a sportin
that little bright thing on ye coat  cause
its purty
  at this thrust gideon ashford stared
silently his broken limb was beginning
to give him exerutiating pain now baskin
winked slyly at his sober-faced pal
  and hes a-carryin that  i reckon
lonesome to keep anybody from a-takin
the badge offen him say gid that shore
looks to me like sheriff henrys gun how
much did he offer ye to bring us in tell
the truth or i wisht i may drap dead in my
tracks ef i turn a hand to hep ye and
goodness knows yere in a bad fix out here
miles from nowhere and not able to walk
a step and ready to bleed to death
ashford didnt answer he glanced to-
ward the widening red circle in the snow
under his leg and fear gripped his heart-
strings lonesome bentley looked mean-
ingly at howling jim
  wed better light a rag awfay from here
howlin said he the sheriff might
come enny minute come on les go
good night to ye gid
  the two turned from the fire leaving
ashford staring after them with eyes that
were afraid and full of pain and started up
the cove in the silent darkness when they
had gone well out of the circle of firelight
baskin nudged his companion and whis-
pered 
  do ye really mean to leave him that-
away lonesome wasnt we a little
rough to him
  we wont go far bentley whispered
back maybe we was a little rough to
him but it was in self-defense dont
ysee howlin ef gid knows anything
aboul the robrv mebbe hell tell it as the
price of us a-carrvin him to the camp
he knows hell die here and jail is alius
betlern death to a skunk i got a notion
gid is the robber hisself howlin cause
hes die only man in the outfit whats
low-down enough to pull off a job like
that
  ive wondered ef it could possibly ha
been billy allison hes sort o light-
headed lonesome a-bein  not much moren
a boy iiow could gid ha got the safe
open
  ax somebody else i dont know
but-
  a jerking agonized yell from gideon
ashford cut bentleys speech short
  lonesome come back ill make it safe
for ye at the camp
  the two pals turned and walked slowly
to the now low-burned fire ashford
slopped his groaning long enough to suggest
that they carry him to the edge of the
camp clearing and leave him there they
howling jims pal

wouldnt listen and ashford began to
groan again finally he broke down com-
pletely
  take me to garrett henry he begged
and ill dear ye both it was me that
robbed the safe it was me that drapped
the letter there at the safe but i didnt do
it a-purpose i never knowed id lost it
till henry found it i hid the six hundred
dollars in the up-stairs o the boardin-
house nancy she handed me that letter
to give to you lonesome and i-i-
  opened it and read it clipped bentley
like skunks alius does go on wi the
cat-killin how did ye git in the safe
gid
  i watched billy allison when he put
the money in it the night afore confessed
the pain-wracked ashford and he-i seed
that the fool boyd forgot to lock it hurry
lonesome for im a-hurtin awful and id
ruther go to jail an to die out here in the
cold
  well by grab almost shouted howling
jim baskin as he knelt to fashion a blue
bandanna tourniquet for ashfords tom and
bleeding limb
  while baskin worked with the injured
man lonesome took nancys letter from
his pocket the letter that he had thought an
old one and read it by the firelight in it
nancy declared that she had hardly slept
since she had broken her engagement with
him and asked him to forgive her if he
could for having been such a fool bent-
leys heart leaped almost to liis throat and
his smile was broad as he remembered that
he had once started to her to beg her for-
giveness for that same white little sin
fifteen days later more or less
there came a bright and sunny
sunday afternoon when the snow
was all gone bentley and nancy walked
up the woods path that led from old nathan
kirklands hewn-log cabin entered the
grassy clearing that held the logging-camp
on big brother creek and went to the
boarding-house porch there they turned
to face smilingly some thirty stalwart
timberjacks who had just broken off their
usual sunday afternoon horse-play to watch
them
  boys began the strong young man on
the porch removing his broad-brimmed hat
with a rather grandiose sweep of his right
hand i beg permission to interduce missis
superintendent lonesome bentley wish
us well boys
  at first there was a mere murmur of
sound among the loggers then a ripple-
then a wild and hearty yell rose from their
throats and shattered itself against the two
mountainsides bentley began to look the
loggers over a trifle anxiously wtiere was
howling jim he had invited baskin to
be present at his wedding but baskin
hadnt promised a hundred times before
he had located his pal by merely listening
for him so now he raised a hand for silence
and silence came
  from somewhere high on the laurel-
covered breast of the everlasting big
brother there came to the ears of those in
the valley a half-sad voice lifted up in a sort
of abandon
ye may break-a my bones with-a sticks ana
    stones-
   im a-goin to live anyhow till i die
        author oj heathens the devils own etc
the first part of the story briefly retold in story form
 u urricane williams clad in a pair
of trousers cut off at the knee his skin burned
black as that of a savage by the sun of the southern
pacific looked out from under heavy brows at the
slender young man before him
  gilbert lang he said i am an outlaw-a
nigger-lover the most hated and despised white
man in the south sea islands why do you want
to come with me
  silently lang held out a hand which bore a heavy
ring on which were carved greek letters williams
seized the hand and gazed at the ring keenly then
he asked a question
 man or woman
  both-probably i know they came to some
one of these islands and i was told that you went
about on these islands more than any man so i
came to you
 williams motioned to two handsome young
savages who came running
  they will get your traps ashore and bring
them here he said to lang
  so gilbert lang came to be the only while
follower of hurricane williams of black followers
williams had many a swarm of tongans and
samoans men and women boys and girls followed
williams as he went about the soulh seas trading
fishing wandering lie was known as a terror
he was far more intelligent than i he traders who
hated him and he had nothing to do with white
men until gilbert lang came to him
  vengeance is mine was written in greek on
the ring that lang wore and the three words told
what had brought him to the south sea it was to
revenge himself on the man and woman-brother
and sister supposedly-who had killed his brother
george and alice brown were their names and
alice brown had been his brothers wife lang
had never seen either he had sought them across
the earth to the south seas and joined fortunes
with williams that he might seek them the
belter
  slowly he became accustomed to the strange lite
the savages he found childlike in their happiness
and love of play the old men and women petted
him the young men became his comrades the
young girls coquetted with him the children played
with him
  then williams took the whole party on board
his ship the mary and sailed to an island where
he knew of oyster-beds williams half expected
a light at the oyster beds not with the natives
for lie quickly made friends with ghorki chief of
the gopassa people and with baraka the devil-
devil man but with willerby king of the south
seas who also knew of the wealth of the place
  as lang sat alone one day uala most beautiful
of the native girls crept up to him
  f love you she said softly
  lang was lonesome and homesick uala was
beautiful he kissed her
  langl he heard an angry voice behind him
and he turned to see williams glare at him a moment
and then stride away
gilbert lang was suffused with
a feeling of guilt and shame he
on a quest of vengeance had
stooped to dalliance and with a
savage memory of it would have been
distressing enough without having to re-
member that williams had come upon them
williams was an enigma much about
him was distasteful yet his tense dominant
personality in a certain way compelled
admiration and though gilbert lang tried
to tell himself that he cared not one way or
the other for williams approval yet he
knew that it was not so he did care
he wished that he might not have to face
williams again

savages
a tour-vart story
part f
by gordon tolng
savages

  what tidal folly could have so swept him
from his senses true uala was beautiful
and sweet but at best she was a native
perhaps those pretty teeth of hers had
picked dead mens bones he shivered
he had kissed her again and again
  tears of rage and shame came to his eyes
and stood there glistening the very
thought of her evoked something of the
fascination of her presence and he tried
to loath himself for his weakness in not
being thoroughly disgusted
  gilbert lang was one of those complex
organisms that can only be bred far from
fields and forests the noblesse oblige of
culture was ingrained in him-or rather had
veneered him all men are emotionally
alike deep down in their hearts only in some
the emotions are rarely if ever stirred
he was a clean-hearted pure-eyed boy but
he was very young and he had come from a
hot-house world into jungles he was be-
wildered that there was within him unsus-
pected emotions-weaknesses to his way
of thinking-that leaped up like monsters
conjured by a wizard
  he had killed men he had pressed his
lips to the mouth of a savage woman no
gilbert lang did not know could not
know that the roots of him were down the
mold that he was a human being and
nothing more that the only difference be-
tween him and a bushman was the
superficial difference of color and culture
he was no more aware of that than he was
aware that he avid all men carry within
them traces of the gills that served then-
amphibian ancestors	
  so he lay homesick heart-sick and
shamed lay on his face and his face was
buried in the crook of his arm
  it was late in the afternoon when he
looked up and he rubbed his eyes from
surprize
  three ships had entered the bay he
knew nothing of ships but one was larger
than lhe other two
   the first flash into his brain was that he
could get passage out on one of them
  he got up and hurried down to the beach
and even he thought it strange that there
were so few natives in sight when the
mary had come in the water was alive with
outriggers and the beach crowded now
not only the beach but the village seemed
deserted here and there a little group of
natives stood watching but that was all
  a boat was being rowed in from one of
the ships
  gilbert lang went out on the jetty built
of coral rocks that ran some distance out
to deep water and there he waited
  as the boat made for the jetty he could
see that it contained three white men be-
sides the black boys at the oars
  what the-s the matter a roaring
voice called at him some fifty yards from
the landing as the boat came on
  nothing he shouted back
  gilbert lang soon thought-and never
afterward changed his opinion-that the
burly short-legged man with the great
roaring voice was the most profane individ-
ual on earth
  jeb jackson never spoke without swear-
ing if one undertook to set down his
remarks literally the account would re-
semble nothing that ever got into print
and to indicate the censored oaths would be
to scar the pages with unending dots and
dashes
  his next remark set down as near as one
dares was
 then why the - - aint these
---niggers down at the -
beach and who the--are you
  the boat skilfully guided by the white
man who steered with an oar slipped
alongside missing the rocks by the width
of a ladys hand and jeb jackson leaped
to the jetty before the other men in
the boat had even steadied themselves
upright
  my name is gilbert la-
  gilbert eh said jackson looking
him over critically well gilbert im
giad to meet you
  and he thrust out a hand like a lumpy
knotted ham
  what you doin here trader look
more like a stray globe-trotter wtiatre
the niggers doin fattenin you up and
whats the matter with these spit images
of satan want trouble do they theyll
get it yes son theyll get it why
aint they down here beggin tobacco
and try in to trade smoked copra for new
rifles wtiats wrong
 hey you fellow come quick me
fellow gammon you hurry up for the
love of judas priest why you fellows no
here want temback come here-and
jeb jackson let go of a spurt of profanity
that almost gave the air a sulfur odor as he
ii
adventure
shouted at the lone figure of a withered old
native who came slowly hesitatingly along
the jetty
  jackson liked to talk or at least he
seemed to like it he always did most of
it aud there was scant chance of any one
interrupting him for his was the booming
voice of an old-time mate who in addition
to a leather throat had a barrel-like chest
while he was talking the two
other white men both heavily
armed climbed on the jetty and
stood curiously looking at gilbert lang
one of these men was obviously a sailor a
boatswain perhaps the other was a man
who seemed almost as much out of place at
gopassa as gilbert
  he was rather thin and dark-hued but
with die darkness and body of the latin
his eyes were black and cunning and the
mouth wore an unconscious wicked sneer
he was neatly dressed in white duck and
wore a yachting cap he carried a rifle
and wore two revolvers the other man
was as heavily equipped jeb jackson did
not have anything in the way of a weapon
  come here you seventh son of the
mother of satanjackson shoutedat the lone
native then changing to the pidgin english
used and understood throughout almost the
whole of the south seas he demanded again
that you fellow come closer
  baraka cautiously edged nearer
  dubeque this is gilbert aint a
missionary are you jackson said un-
dertaking to introduce the man in white
duck and at the same time make sure that
the boy was not one of those most dreaded
and hated persons in the islands that is
dreaded and hated by the men who sailed
with and for willerby the large ship
moored out in the bay was the bcbe
  pleased to meet you said dubeque
quickly politely perhaps influenced by
gilbert langs embarrassed but emphatic
denial that he was a missionary
  and in his momentary confusion he
neglected to explain that his name was not
gilbert but gilbert lang
  dubeque talked with a soft and fluid
ease words came from his tongue smooth as
dripping oil and his voice was low-pitched
almost melodious but just a little too
unctuous
  while jackson was trying to hold conver-
sation with the wily baraka dubeque
pitched his voice low and in about thirty
confidential seconds explained that he and
his cousin were the guests of winston
willerby who had quite a party on board -
a charmmg and lively party-and they had
not expected to find any white men at
gopassa they were very much puzzled
at the attitude of the natives for it was
unnatural and usually indicated hostile
intention for the natives to stay off the
water and beach when a ship came in
  dubeque obviously said what he did in
the expectation that gilbert would in turn
sjjeak of himself
  and gilbert did he had at first no
liking for dubeques face but dubeque
seemed a gentleman it was a pleasure to
hear english spoken fluently and quietly
again and gilbert was interested and
hopeful to learn that there was a party of
white people on the bebe he said that he
hadbeen traveling about with hurricane
williams who came to gopassa some weeks
before after pearls and he could not imagine
what was the matter with the natives for
they were certainly not hostile but friendly
very friendly
  dubeque scarcely heard the last of
gilbert langs septence he hastily glided
forward and prodded jacksdn into an al-
titude of attention saying excitedly
hurricane williams is here pearling
and gilbert came with him williams
has stirred up the niggers as usual
jackson gave a questioning grunt and
stared at gilbert lang doubtfully
  you come with williams
  jackson seemed skeptical gilbert did
not look at all like the sort of a man wil-
liams would take up with
  yes
  so that tiger-shark is here pearling
funny fellow that williams aint he
jackson asked in a tone that passed for
low with him but his voice rumbled like
distant thunder
  gilbert readily admitted that williams
was strange at times
  so you say hes got these niggers primed
for trouble with us eh
  no he didnt say that dubeque
hastily put in i did you know wher-
ever this beach-comber goes he makes
trouble for white men
  does he now jackson asked there
was something peculiar in his manner of
asking it
savages

  hes notorious dubeque insisted
  yes seems to me ive heard o him
said jackson with a shade of irony in his
voice and the irony though lost to du-
beques cars caught gilbert langs atten-
tion
  jeb jackson had formerly been mate on a
yankee whaler that was years ago he
had beaten up a bullying half-crazed skip-
per then had taken to the beach and had
stayed in the south seas ever since eventu-
ally going into the employ of winston
willerby
  dubeque swore viciously in his low oily
smooth way and said there was not a decent
man in the south seas who had not heard of
williams and said that he was a trouble-
maker
  youre right youre right son jack-
son answered casually hes the greatest
little trouble-maker-an finisher-in these
parts old w w ought to be quite inter-
ested hes wished nough times he could
run across him
  by the way gilbert dubeque asked
quickly come back with us to the ship
i want to introduce you to willerby
fine fellow to know will you
  i shall be pleased said gilbert lang
  jackson grunted he knew paul du-
beque and why dubeque wanted to carry
gilbert back to the ship where he and
willerby could question him about wil-
liams
  hey you below there jackson shouted
down at the boat throw up that
raffle
  the raffle was odds and ends of trade
goods which the black boys threw up to
jackson he had brought presents for the
village but as none other than baraka ap-
proached jackson generously presented the
whole lot to him jackson was not a
trader he was a seaman willerby was
a goods eaman himself when sober but he
kept jackson near him and gave him the
hard and dangerous work to do-as going
ashore to a village that appeared hostile
  paul dubeque was a man after willerbys
heart he had known paul for years
also he had known pauls cousin-lania-
pronounced la-nigh-a-dubeque some
months before there had been trouble be-
tween willerby and the dubeques and the
latter fled into hiding but recently every-
thing had been patched over and the old
relations resumed
  gilbert lang got into the boat and when
it shoved away from the jetty he wished
that he might never again set foot on that
island he expected to however he was
going on board the bebe with no intention
of not returning he was beginning rather
to like dubeque who was more friendly and
courteous than any other man met since
leaving honolulu and jackson too in
spite of profanity seemed to be only a big
hale hearty fellow but gilbert lang
sensed that jackson had a kind of veiled
contempt for dubeque
v
hthe bebe was moored a hundred
and fifty yards from the jetty and
within shouting distance of one of
the luggers
  an awning that served to keep away rain
or sun was stretched over the poop a
six-pound brass cannon with a carriage that
could be run to port or starboard was in
the waist this was ostensibly for pro-
tection but winston wtillerby occasionally
took upon himself the prerogatives of euro-
pean men-of-war and shelled a village in
those days and until recently very re-
cently if a white man got killed or hurt in
a coast village-no matter why or how-
and a war-ship happened to come along
even months afterward the village was
shelled to show the savages that they could
not trifle with the lives of civilized men
  willerby was a big man in many a way
he really was he had a genius for trade
for commerce and what he may have lacked
in attention to details and good manage-
ment he made up in jealously keeping
rivals from the field he was a large-
bodied man with a shaven red face a heavy-
jowled face and gray eyes his magnifi-
cence was unapproached in the south
seas in australia even the bebe was a
beautiful ship and a floating palace wil-
lerby made money and spent it and not
the least of his expenditures were for food
and drink the chef on the bebe had been
drawn by willerbys princely wage from a
passenger-steamer her immense refriger-
ator was stored with ice rumor had it
that willerby every six months had a ship-
load of ice brought to his plantation in the
fijis
  willerby spent most of his time at sea
and in good company he kept a small

adventure
orchestra that furnished music for the
nightly dance for now that he was in
wealth and influence-if not officially-a
king he never hailed without companions
a half dozen or more guests trading-
s tat ions were to be visited the australian
markets investigated and the footholds of
independent traders to be jarred loose
  he combined business with pleasure and
carried new stocks for his traders took on
board the contents of their warehouses
was ever ready to carry out any new scheme
that had money in it and pearling had a
peculiar fascination for him not only be-
cause the shell was valuable but because he
seemed to have a genuine passion for pearls
he had luggers at thursday island and a
schooner that every year visited paumotu
reefs any one who reported a new oyster-
bed coidd always gain his ear
  the sun disappeared with almost the
suddenness of being swallowed by some
black cosmic monster that lurked near the
western horizon just as the boat bearing
gilbert lang approached the bcbe but her
poop was ablaze with lanterns and the
shadowy shapes of men and women could
be seen through the rays of the lanterns
voices raised in laughter and bantering
could be heard far out on the water
  gilbert lang followed dubeque up the
sea-ladder and to the poop after them
came the burly barrel body of jackson
  gilbert langs first impression was of
some attractive though unreal world into
which he had been thrown two white-
coated chinese boys moved about on noise-
less feet with trays and glasses in which
the tinkling of ice wras heard women
beautiful women white women in brilliant
gowns and jewels-scarcely less resplendent
in the lantern-light than if they all had been
genuine-were grouped about men in pressed
duck suits
  the soft lights took much of the hardness
from the faces that he saw the honest
sun would have shown him that there was
not a face there unmarked with a kind of
cunning or without the scars of sin no face
but one and hers was beautiful in the way
that the evilest of womens often are for
some few years
  lania dubeque had the flashing bizarre
face that lures even the wise the unillu-
sioned to folly some men many in fact
might be sufficiently inexpert in character
perception to believe her words and pose
when she assumed a certain innocence
others most others might know all there
was to knowr about her and yet not care
hei voice too was soft and smooth sweet
and plausible her words-unless she spoke
in anger when a fishwife might well have
shrunk
    she sat in a chair a long wicker chair and
 by her sat winston willerby
    i hough it could at once be perceived that
 she l-hjre a family resemblance to dubeque
 still she did not have either his eyes or his
 mouth her face was not regular in the
  lassical fashion the faces of fascinating wo-
 men never are in such faces there is a unique
 irregularity that first arrests the surprized
 attention then the beholder more or less
 swiftly is likely to come under the spell of
 her serpentine personality there seems
 to be something serpentine wicked about
 all really fascinating women
   hurricane williams is over there
 dubeque shouted breathlessly to willerby
   the people about the deck drew near to
 listen most of them stared at gilbert
 lang stared in that curious noncommital
 way that leaves people free to accept the
 stranger as a comrade or a spoil-sport
 but their stares were not long nor steady
 most of them looked at dubeque who was
 very much excited and some of them who
 knew of hurricane williams glanced re-
 peatedly at willerby to see how he was
 taking dubeques information
 but lania did not take her eyes
off gilbert langs face from un-
der her long lashes she watched him
steadily two long pendant black pearls
were at her ears-not pear-shaped pearls
but baroques that had been matched with
some care and a great deal of luck any
one finding a large shield-like baroque
would never expect to find its mate and the
chances would be infinitely reduced if the
baroque were black tis an old saying
and true jerhaps old as the pearl-fishers of
arabian waters from whence were drawn
pearls of great price for solomon match
a pearl and you double the value of both
   those pendant earrings were without
 price they could not be purchased
 many women had worn them they were
 in a wav the tiara of willerbys court if
 a herald had cried it forth in a stentorian
 voice it would not have been better known
 that the woman who wore them was not to
savages

 receive attention from other men it would
 be perilous for her and for the men lania
 had first worn those earrings a year and
 more before and the eldest son of a lord
 had fallen in love with her lania and
 paul dubeque fled the lord was notified
 by letter that reached to his english
 manor house that his son and heir had been
 hauled under by sharks
  gilbert lang did not notice how she was
watching him he too was listening to
dubeque and looking again and again
at willerby
  hes trying to make trouble look at
the way the natives act and pearling on
your grounds here is the chance to catch
that pirate he- indicating gilbert-
can give you the details dubeque con-
cluded
  willerbys fingers opened and shut writh-
ingly on the arms of the chair and liis face
grew red and more red with apoplectic rage
he looked gilbert up and down and through
him too willerby was something of a
judge of men he sometimes said that
none were to be trusted which is a common
opinion among men of large financial
affairs but still he had had to pick his
traders his agents and managers he
knew some tiling of men and he was trying
to comprehend what that frail boy with the
refined not quite matured face was doing
with williams
  so youre in with him are you
willerby said hoarsely menacingly
  no said gilbert lang i took pas-
sage with him out of the carolines i
know nothing about his business he said
he was an outlaw and he has influence with
the natives and he is pearl-fishing that
is about all i know of him
  now gilbert lang spoke the truth and
he was glad that he could say that and know
it was true he had no love for williams
though a certain exasperating admiration-
much like the charm of uala-rose from
time to time but just at that moment
or rather afternoon and evening he was
glad to be able to say that they were not
closely associated scarcely acquaintances
certainly not friends
  a heavy guttural grunt rolled up from
the chest of jackson who had been standing
impassively near-by
  gilbert lang glanced at him jackson said
nothing he merely looked back at gilbert
lang but the look made the boy angry
with jackson angry with himself angry
with williams the huge sailor seemed
silently expressing contempt for one who
denied his friend
  now gilbert lang did not consider
williams his friend he said so he said
so to willerby but it was for jackson that
he spoke and every second lanias steady-
dark eyes peering alertly from under
slumbrous lids were on him
  im glad to know that glad to know
that boy said willerby who believed
him
  willerby spoke not in a hospitable man-
ner but ratlier as a judge who has dis-
covered that the suspected person is inno-
cent of everything but bad company
  but what are you doin down here
tell me that
  gilbert lang was impaled by that ques-
tion willerby required an answer he
assumed the right to know the wrherefore
and wrhy of every mans presence if there
was the remote chance of it interfering with
the willerby interests gilbert lang
could no more tell his story than he could
have been gratuitously insulting the
rebuke that williams had given him when
he had ventured to mention the tragedy back
of his request had left a scar deep within
him and besides here were many ears
none of them sympathetic but gilbert
lang could not pose as a trader or a scien-
tist or any of those tilings
  mr willerby he said i came dowm
to the south seas to rather look around
and i didnt have the faintest idea that it
was nearly as large as it is i wouldnt
wrant to call myself an adventurer but
that is about the nearest to it
  has williams been gettin pearls
  not that i know of
  hes got that gang of niggers with him
hasnt he
  samoans and tongans
  by - ill get him and get him to-
night willerby cried springing up and
not wholly unconscious of the dramatic
value of his words and manner
  he was angry but he was not too beside
himself to note the admiring murmurs and
eyes of his guests-if such a parasitical lot
could be called by that ancient and honor-
able name
  well steal a march on him willerby
went on interrupting the statement of his
intentions at this point to curse the soul

adventure
and body of williams then jackson
you take what men you need no lights
understand land on the beach this
boyll go along and show you the way
grab him and get back before his niggers
know you have him i want to tell that
fellow to his face what i think of him
then-
  willerby ended abruptly with a signifi-
cant sweep of his arm that suggested push-
ing somebody overboard into the black
water
  ill make your fortune for you he
said to the horrified boy from this day
on winston willerby is behind you and
that means something down in this country
dont it
  his question was an appeal to those who
stood about him and emphatic words
flashing hastily from male and female
throats many of them loud words so that
he might be sure which throat had spoken
agreed that it meant much it was the great-
est thing that could happen to a man in the
south seas some of the women cast
speculating glances at gilbert lang he
had suddenly become worth while
  only lania dubeque remained silent
she was above such flattery hers was
more subtle besides she was sure of her
position on board the bebe or at the home
plantation in the fijis but not for one
second did she take her eyes off gilbert
lang there was something about the
boy that more than interested her-almost
disturbed her she could not tell what it
was
  well willerby continued in the large
way that a man may assume when by a
smile or a frown he has the power to affect
the fortunes of others youre in with
winston willerby from now on just go
along with jackson here and point out
that--s hut and jackson and his
menll do the rest
  now gilbert lang had found williams a
peculiarly unfriendly man and disagreeable
as well as at times terrifying the boy had
been born into a home and raised in sur-
roundings where a very deep and sincere
religious feeling existed williams had
been constantly blasphemous more even
than that williams had on one horrible
occasion said that he would not crook a
finger to stop a cannibal feast he had
many reasons for disliking as well as fearing
williams and few were known for liking him
  true he had awakened out of his feverish
delirium to find himself in williams hut
and hammock but gilbert lang knew
nothing of williams vigils his unremitting
attention he knew  more of those
things than of lulas gift of her precious
knife to baraka as the price for exorcising
the devil out of him it was natural that
gilbert lang would almost invariably
mistake discourtesy-such as was con-
tinuous in williams-for a kind of re-
pulsiveness of character
  he did not feel the jiersonal loyalty of
the comrade for williams and being very
young as well as more or less unconsciously
eager to tell something-to give information
-which is an impulse by no means re-
stricted to the youthful-he had been un-
aware of the ugly sound his words had had
when he disclaimed all knowledge of wil-
liams business and all friendship for him
  but willerbys suggestion smote gilbert
lang as an insult would have done in a
way it was an insult to deny friendship
for williams was one thing to deliver him
into the hands of the unfriendly was another
  mr willerby he said his voice trem-
bling from the effort to remain calm i
could not think of doing such a thing as
you propose
there was silence about the deck
as those unexpected words fell from
his lips willerby looked at him
just looked as a monarch might stare at
some poor fool who had done an incom-
prehensible thing dubeques evil lips
iarted in a kind of amazed gasp jeb
jackson slipped his thumbs into his belt
leaned against the railing and sort of re-
laxed into the attitude of a spectator
jacksons face was heavily bearded so no
one could detect the sort of a smile that ran
along his mouth lania dubeque nar-
rowed her eyes and leaned slightly forward
  then willerby cut loose he cursed the
boy with a boatswains tongue accused him
of being a williams spy of the same breed
and ilk as that thrice-damnable thief and
white cannibal as well as an ingrate for
wasnt he willerby about to make his
gilbert langs fortune and that was the
manner of his repay
  jackson he concluded throw him
into irons hell never get off this ship
again-alive
  then it was that lania dubeque gasped
savages

her black eyes suddenly fierce shifted to
willerbys face and she put out a hand as
if tc protest but the hand fell again
to the arm of her chair she lay back and
kept silent watching gilbert lang in-
tently
  the boy slender pale with anger con-
fused by the injustice stared at willerby
willerby was furious but gilbert lang
thought such an order must at most be
only a threat men did not do such things
  but jackson taking a half dozen steps
forward called from the poop for grogan
thethird mate and grogan came
  irons an drop him down the for-
ward hatch said jackson carelessly with
a gesture toward gilbert lang
  git cried dubeque ever anxious in
some distinguishing way to aid the wishes
of willerby as he gave the boy a shove and
kicked him
  gilbert lang wheeled and leaped he
smote the fastidious dubeque on lhe mouth
anci whirled another fist to the jaw the
dormant blood of his fighting forefathers
who had raised to prestige the name of
lang was foaming in his veins again as
among the raiding bushmen he knew no
fear and had no thought of it injustice set
him wild wrillerbys order to throw him
into irons had made him like a barrel of
dry powder but it was dubeque who ap-
plied the match
  lauia dubeque sprang to her feet and
drew back she did not cry out others
were doing that
  the fight was short its length was
scarcely countable in seconds it was not
really a fight for paul dubeque did noth-
ing but scream and try to protect himself
by bending down and covering his face
  when jackson profanity flowing from
his bearded mouth reached out a powerful
deliberate arm and gripped gilbert lang
then dubeque remembered the revolvers
at his side and snatched at them
  wilh feline swiftness lania pushed him
to one side crying-
  you fool
  willerby was storming and ordering all
manner of terrible things at once to be done
jo gilbert lang-whose name he even did
not know had not heard
  but jackson half pushing and half
carrying the boy down the poop ladder
t urned him over to grogan
  put him somewhere so w w dont
stumble across him stick him some place
-to keep him from scaping-an dubeque
from knifin him said jackson to grogan
in a whisper
  then aloud with lurid oaths he roared for
grogan to make gilbert lang lament the
day of his birth and that he had never
learned manners enough not to strike
gentlemen in the face
  a-r-r-right said grogan hoarsely and
fiercely jerking the struggling dazed boy
along as easily as a man might pull a frail
child
  willerby was beside himself he was
often beside himself but familiarity with
his rage did not breed contempt in those
who lived on the ship with him true
lania dubeque had a way of seeming un-
impressed but if there was something
of the roaring bull in him there was a good
deal of the tiger in her probably no other
woman would ever have returned as she
did to face willerbys jealous rage when she
had fled it possibly she was ashamed of
herself for having fled and that was why
she returned
  too she may have been aware of her
charms and confident it is the conscious-
ness of beauty not of brains that makes
women daring in that picaresque sensa-
tional way that frequently startles not only
communities but nations
  as willerby stamped the deck and
stormed all but lania and paul dubeque
drew respectfully away from him du-
beque presuming somewhat on his bat-
tered face solicitiously felt of his swollen
lips and a finger with a delicate touch ran
along his jawr to see if it wtere really broken
  take the crews off the luggers and every
man off the bcbc and go get that fellow
williams willerby shouted at jackson
bring him here ill tend to him ill
show him that winston willerby cant
be made a fool of send that girlish kid
here as a spy will he by -  cut
his eyes out and use em for fish-bait do
you hear me
  yes jackson rumbled i hear you
but-
  but what willerby demanded im-
patiently
  we can muster about ten white men
he paused to let his eyes sweep the guests
in the background who though white men
-and women-were not included in the
muster and williams-he aint called
i
advent ure
a hurricane cause he has a windy mouth
either-is the best rifle-shot tween here an
hell an has a hundred niggers too
youre afraid willerby sneered
let me go w w ill bring
him said dubeque speaking with
effort at articulation because of his
swollen lips
  but at the same time as he spoke paul
dubeque assumed what he thought was an
attitude of utter exhaustion and physical
debility which a courageous fighting-spirit
was trying to overcome he was pretty
confident that willerby would tell him to
go to bed instead dubeques histrionics
were not lost on anybody but willerby
they all played the same game of flattery
sympathy and pose and were jealous when
one was more successful than the others
all that is of willerbys guests and social
associates
  hear that said willerby in rising anger
to jackson this boys willing to do it an
youre afraid you give me excuses-
  let him said jackson whose temper
was like touchwood anyway and whose
respect for dubeque was only to be re-
presented by a minus quantity
  for willerby he did have respect and a
certain though not exaggerated liking
willerby had faults and of late years was
given to wanton overbearing but he was a
bold ruthless fellow and if cruel not with-
out courage
  let him jackson repeated an if
williams ever starts for him hell think hes
tangled up with a couple o bolts o light-
ning now listen w w i know this fel-
low williams i dont simply know of
him like the rest o you i know him
when i was a young fellow in the states i
went out west to what they called cow-
towns and mining-camps an this fellow
williams is what them people d call a
killer you send a gang over there alter
him an some o us may come back an
some wont an you wont be no nearer to
williams than you are now
  hes not over there asleep ill bet hes
got black boys with rifles squatting all
along back of the beach an at the first
whoop out o him all -  break loose
im not afraid o him or no man but i
dont wrant to commit suicide
  jackson could have told had he chosen-
but he never told any one-that his intro-
duction to williams had been swift and
painful jackson for scarcely more of a
reason than that he was half-drunk and
hard-fisted had once upon a time knocked
down a black boy on a beach when there
suddenly appeared a man half-mated
seemingly scarcely more than half of jack-
sons size jacksons shipmates were
ashore and around him they had laughed
when he liit the nigger
  apologize to that boy said the strange
white man in a strange quiet tense way
as the moaning native rose fearfully and
unsteadily
  jacksons reply was what any one might
expect it to have been
  the answer of the strange white man was
most unexpected
  when jackson somewhat recovered con-
sciousness after passing through a sort of
blurred haze of bumps and blows he had
raised himself from the sand and saw the
man and native walking off together while
his own shipmates stood in a kind of silent
wonder watching
  jackson cursed them for their inaction
that they should so go back on a shipmate
as to let the fellow get away
  thats hurricane williams said a
grizzly old harpooner who had been much
in those waters
  an if you dont want im t git awye
said an english sailor just shout fer im
to come byke ell come ha-runninv
  in the three or four years since that
jackson had not met him again or mentioned
their first introduction he had heard
much of williams of his amazing suddenness
and strength his readiness to fight or to
kill of his cunning and boldness
  dont want to commit suicide wil-
lerby repeated contemptuously dubeque
take what men you want and bring that
fellow here-alive
willerby said it with a majestic flourish
he laid his hand on dubeques shoulder as
a king might lay an accolade on some
obscure soldiet who was being raised to the
post of honor and danger abandoned by a
craven captain but the dramatic climax
was close to being ruined by something
resembling a snicker that ran thfough the
group and dubeques knees threatened to
give way beneath his amazement even
lania smiled understanding and not
without enjoyment
  jackson was a good sailor and in those
savages

largely ill-charted or uncharted waters as
good a navigator as willerby could expect
to find in combination with a certain un-
scrupulousness and close-mouthed loyalty
he valued the last as much as seamanship
and so jackson often presumed upon that
value as in the instance of his refusal to
try kidnaping hurricane williams
  dubeque having bluffed realised well
enough that it was ruinous not to pretend
at least to be proud and make the effort
  some of the things which dubeque may
have lacked in courage he replaced with
cunning
  tu go alone he said just let me
have enough men to row the boat
  there probably was not a person who
heard him excepting willerby who did
not believe that dubeque rejected com-
panions so there would be no witnesses to
deny the story he could tell by way of ex-
plaining his failure and that is probably
exactly what dubeque at first had in mind
  hear that jackson this lad is going
alone or willing to i wont allow it
paul no take fifty or a hundred men
by-well all go
  it made no difference that willerby could
not possibly have mustered a hundred men
he was given to speaking in large numbers
  but dubeque protested and his pro-
tests were sincere he said that many
would attract attention and they would
have the whole villages and williams
natives on them in the darkness he be-
lieved he could manage alone better just
get the boat ready and give him time to
wash up a little a vague idea of what he
might be able to do had come to him
  and he walked to the companion way
with the conscious importance of a hero
  willerby was pleased with him said
things of praise and others had to agree
readily with the compliments
  lania slipped away unnoticed and follow-
ed dubeque coming into his cabin as he
stood with a wash-rag in hand before a
mirror
  im proud of you paul proud of you
she said sweetly and suiting her expression
to the words
  he took the words as a hungry shark takes
pork
  ill show that bunch of cheaps i
know what theyve all been saying theyre
crazy with jealousy since we got in so good
with w w again
  oh those cats and snakes does it
hurt much she asked with am appearance
of tenderness coming closer and letting a
sinuous arm slip around his waist
  howd you like to have your face
battered up say and whyd you stop me
when i was going to kill that fellow
  there was a touch of menace in the
question
  paul she exclaimed injuredly and
when you know how all those people hate
us-and if something should happen to
willerby you wouldnt have had a
chance before the british commissioner
theyd have sworn it was cold-blooded
murder there would have been seven or
eight against just us two you must
think of such things
  he was thoughtful for a moment lanias
reasoning was a little far-fetched but
plausible enough if one admitted that some-
thing might happen to w illerby
  nothing will happen to him
  let us hope not but you cant tell
hes drinking hard and this williams-
  leave that fellow to me he said
mysteriously
  but w w said he wanted him alive
dont worry hell be alive but that
gilbert-he wont long
  what did you say his name was she
asked quickly
  gilbert im going to stick a knife in
him
  gilbert gilbert mr gilbert she
repeated thoughtfully
  there was something about the boy but
nothing about the name that stirred vague
things somewhere in lanias brain he
was a beautiful poised refined boy such as
few women of the far places have ever met
who is he she asked
   dont know and i dont care lean
tell you what hell be in less an a week if
thatll interest you a corpse
  lania motionless looked at him from the
comers of her eyes
  say he flashed at her turning from
the mirror and youve got to hit it up
harder youve been cold as an icicle round
w w lately beginning to be again like you
were just before you met ballantyne
ballantyne was the eldest son of the
english lord who so liis father had been
told was pulled down by a shark
   if i drank like the rest of those cats id
soon look like them she said at once

adventure
explaining and evading his remark i have
to keep my head and face i dont wear
these- touching the black pearl pendants
-because i go to bed drunk every morn-
ing
  you take care not to pull any more fool
plays im in good with willerby now and
im not going to lose out for you or any-
body
   you wouldnt throw me to the sharks
would you paul she asked with just a
perceptible trace of lightness
  the question was at once figurative and
literal
  no he replied with frank irony dab-
bing his swollen face with ointment i
wouldnt throw you overboard any sooner
than youd throw me all along youve
been the one that was in good and me just
hanging on by my eyelashes but im
solid now and after tonight-you can all
go to-if you don  t like my ways w w
wont forget in a hurry who brought this
huricane williams on board
  there was some truth in that much
lania had no love for paul-no more than
he had for her but down deep in her
heart she was afraid of him she always
had been afraid of him and he was far
from being indifferent to her anger so
they had somewhat pooled their fortunes
and though rather distrustful of each other
had accepted a common alliance against
the others with whom willerby took up
besides there was the tie of blood which
rather singled them out for the alliance
rather than gave strength to it
  if paul should be killed lania would
shed tears appear inconsolable and really
miss him but she would be relieved
she rather wished at times that something
would happen to him but she never
showed it and not altogether futilely she
kept up a pretense of affection not so much
because she was a hypocrite as because she
knew very well that something would
happen to her if paul ever became aware of
hei real feeling toward him
pfcnlll when dubeque came on deck the
p four-piece orchestra was strumming
phiwav below and the harmony came
to deck through the- open skylight some
few one or two couples were dancing the
others sat around laughing and drinking
from the trays of the white-clad noiseless-
footed chinamen
  it was far from being the gay social
light-hearted group that it appeared to be-
that those in it tried to deceive themselves
into believing that it was normal people
on shipboard quickly grow tired of one
another and these people were not nor-
mal they had no common denominator
of interest except what they could get out
of willerby each was jealous of the other
they gossiped furiously sometimes quar-
reled and were nightly drunk yet the
women wore gaudy dresses and imitation
stones the men had clean pressed duck
from day to day
  oh paul dont get hurted cooed a
sharp-tongued little blonde
  whatre you going to do take the
brass cannon
  yes wheres your artillery paul
   if that kid had hit him on the other side of
the face hed look like a nigger with the
mumps said the little blonde
  but as willerby came up with lania on
his arm the voices fell and the jibes were
less audible
  im ready w w said dubeque
  why youve forgot your guns boy
exclaimed willerby
  ive a derringer in my pocket id
cam two holsters if i was going over there
to bluff he said with all the aplomb of a
hero but im going to bring him back
with me
  and paul let his eyes stray around the
group
  thats the talk old boy said the
blonde
  hell do it too loudly remarked a fat
roue who suffered from a perpetual short-
ness of breath
  but he had a seemingly endless supply of
good stories that is the sort of stories
that were appreciated on the bebe
  paul said willerby again laying his
hand on the young mans shoulder with a
kind of rough affection i oughtnt to let
you go its too risky dont take any
chances with that-
  and what williams was in willerbys
opinion had best be left to inference
  im doing this for you w w youve
been good to me and lania- something
that resembled a very determined effort at
tenderness came into his voice at the men-
tion of lania- and anything we might do
is only pacing the interest on our debt so
to speak
savages

  and the blonde whispered to the fat
raconteur
  can you blieve it and the old boy
swal lows that gush
  and the fat man with a wheeze and a
puff whispered back
  its lania the old boys swallowed
pauls just hangin on to her petticoat
that snake hissed the little blonde
who hated tail dark women as a matter of
esthetic principle
  boy said willerby i havent done a
thing for you more an you richly deserved
from now on ill show you what the
friendship of winston willerby is worth
by-ill see that you make money-
  not money w w just your friend-
ship thats all i want
  it was raw not another person on board
would have had the consummate nerve to
say such things in the presence of others
though any one who could quietly get to
willerbys ear went as far or further
many of the so-called big men of the earth
want their flattery raw and strong as
others want their liquor they have no
appreciation of flavors and delicacy
  dubeque had long perceived what the
others had not noticed or if so had not
had nerve enough to act on willerby
liked to be praised in public he enjoyed
having spectators others shrank from the
ridicule of their companions paul endured
the ridicule and won the guerdon but
then he had more cunning than most people
any of the others would have been confused
routed if they had ventured the bluff of
going after hurricane williams and had
unexpectedly been sent
  all ready there grogan jackson
shouted down from the side
  a thick irish voice rolled back up
  all ready dubeque
  good luck an look out said willerby
voices shouted their best wishes tinged
with compliments as paul went down to
the sea-ladder and got into the boat
  oh i dont know what would become of
me said lania in soft-voiced agony to
willerbys ears alone
  ill take care of you-always pauls a
fine boy may no harm come to him
but you-god you look great to-
night
  then at the secret shrine of her inner
heart lania prayed that her cousin would
meet hurricane williams and die
vi
f m i the boat after some delay in
i  i locating it landed at the jetty
ljj give me a lantern said du
beque
   it was a black night with that forbidding
tropic blackness that is most ominous under
a half-clouded half-starlit sky when all the
land and bush is one solid shadow
  grogan thought it a strange request for a
man who was about to slip into a village
but he produced a lantern out of the locker
  lightit said dubeque
  he was very uncomfortable and wished
himself headed for the brilliantly lighted
bebe rather than the labyrinthine blackness
of the shore
  phwat the devil does yez want wid a
lanthem whin-
  will you light that lantern and leave me
and my business alone stormed dubeque
think i want to break my neck wandering
around in that bush
  grogan sullenly lighted the lantern and
had some difficulty in concealing the wish
that some such thing would happen to
dubeque
  wait here till i come back said du
beque as he started off his mouth in his
throat every nerve taut and his fingers
tightly gripping the derringer that he had
withdrawn from his pocket
  he wished that he had not only brought
two holsters but every man who could
earn a gun he began to be exceedingly
fearful that he had undertaken more than
was wise and seriously debated blowing out
the lantern and sitting himself down for an
hour then reappearing with some stirring
story of what he had tried to do but he
was stung by the knowledge that almost
everybody on board expected him to do
some such thing as that
  his story might not even fool willerby
the old man had surprizing and fiery moods
and he was not a pleasant one to whom to re-
port failures no matter how they were gar-
nished with details of the efforts made
  now it is not for one minute to be sup-
posed that dubeque would have ventured
into gopassa if he had really believed any
of the more barbarous tilings that he and
others pretended to believe about williams
when the bebe came in those on board had
been surprized and a little suspicious of
trouble because the natives kept out of

adventure
sight but dubeque very craftily realized
after he had blundered into his request to
go for williams that if gilbert lang had
lived among these natives for weeks and felt
no fear it was comparatively safe for him
dubeque to go into the village
  it was pretty well known too that wil-
liams tried to avoid trouble but crowd him
threaten him and it was something like
tying a flaming torch to the tail and a red
rag to the horn of a wild bull that was
the reason why dubeque had summoned up
courage enough to appear to be unarmed
dubeque knew that he was really running
but little risk but he had a difficult time to
feel that way about it he had lived in the
south seas long enough to be familiar with
the fact that the coast natives as a rule are
not wanton murderers
  true some head-hunter is always likely
to be the prowling exception and the of-
fenses of one white man are apt to be vicari-
ously expiated by feasting from the next
who comes but if gilbert lang had had
the run of the village he dubeque would
be reasonably safe dubeque had been
cunning enough to see that though he had
some trouble in summoning up courage
enough to act on it and while there were
none to deny that hurricane williams was a
dangerous man there were some to defend
his character particularly the old-timers
who had married native wives and settled
down to patriarchal dignity and who re-
sented the encroachment of civilization
  dubeque was confident that if he could
come face to face with williams he would
come to the end of his scheme all right he
was cold with fear jumpy and nervous by
being forced to walk alone in the ever-
mysterious night fringed-one might sa-
by the jungle growth yet he had to come
alone he would not for almost anything
have let those on the bebe know what words
he intended to use to williams there
were depths within depths to the cunning of
paul dubeque
  dubeque had left the jetty and was walk-
ing up the beach toward a hut the shaggy
roof of which was faintly perceptible in the
dimmest of starlight
  a voice close at hand called out in painful
english-
  who you
  the jerk of the lantern showed how high
dubeque jumped and in his fear he came
near shooting blindly
  with some effort dubeque stammered in
the trade vernacular
  me fellow come gammon him fellow
williams you fellow go me quick
  there was no direct answer for some time
but he could hear voices clacking and mur-
muring where his remark was evidently
being debated the delay and suspense
came near to stiffening dubeques hair
the impulse to drop the lantern and run
was strong and the cold sweat stood on him
as on the body of one dead from fright
but he succeeded not only in standing his
ground but in calling out
  you fellows like-quick no plenty
time
  the voices grew a lit tie more loud then
the crunch of sand and out of the darkness of
pandanus bushes shapes moved toward him
  dubeque lifted his lantern to get a look
three stalwart native not solomon island-
ers approached and each carried a rifle
that was a little unusual more so than one
might think when rifles are the chief desire of
a native toward a trader but the tropic
rust particularly in the wet solomons soon
reduces the uncared for rifle to such a state
of junk that even the native throws it away
of course it is alwa evil spirits that ruin
the precious rifle
  me go with you said one who spoke
english after a fashion
  who are you dubeque asked as he
scrutinized the handsome face-handsome
that is for a native
  banoo
  then banoo strode off leading the way
  williams sat in his hut with the door
drawn it was drawn not for protection or
fear of peering eyes but somewhat to shut
out the insects that would swarm and fall
finger-deep about the light flap themselves
on the pages of t he book he was reading and
crawl over his body with irritating slowness
the book he read was a book of his own
writing a sort of amplified log not of ad-
ventures and what he saw but a thing full
of nautical findings of winds and depths and
tides and sightings
  banoo scratched on the door and spoke
then williams slipped it back
  banoo told him that this lone man had
come off the bebe to talk
  what do you want williams asked be-
fore banoo had finished
  the question came out like the uneven
volley of a squad
savages

dubeque stepped closer came
into the square of light that the
lantern hung from the hut rafter
shot through the doorway the lantern
that he carried had made only a pool of
light about his feet
  then dubeque lied as with all of his
practise he had never lied before he did
not choose his words with care but spoke
with that fluent earnestness that is so
amazing to truth-tellers who are not only
surprized that some people will deliberately
misstate facts but elaborately relate false
details
  dubeque began by saying that boy gil-
bert had got himself into trouble he had
heard that willerby was no friend of yours
williams and said that he was not one
either
  im one of willerbys managers wil-
liams and he has often been angry at you
he thinks youve interfered with his traders
and recruiters before now but down deep
the old mans had to admire you ive
often heard him say so he is a good deal of
a fighter himself especially in his younger
days and whenever he has thought you
have hurt his pocketbook-why of course
he has been furious but when that fellow
gilbert came on board and said he heard
that hurricane williams was an outlaw and
pirate and that willerby wanted him and
that he gilbert would be glad to point out
your hut so a party could sneak up and grab
you-why williams w w very nearly
tramped the deck in he was that mad
  he just tore around and i got this-
indicating his blackened face-by stepping
in between them when he was swinging on
that fellow gilbert w ws a big man and
that fellows nothing but a boy and i knew
w w d be sorry-he always is-if he hurt
the boy but the idea of anybody suggest-
ing such a thing to him made him clear
crazy he sent me over here to tell you
about it gilberts praying the old man
wont put him ashore and the old man
wont have him on the ship
  williams listened closely his body was
stiff and rigid his eyes agleam out of the
bitterness of experience with his fellow men
he saw no reason for doubting that gilbert
lang had done precisely as dubeque said
the boy had never concealed dislike for him
and that afternoon he had undoubtedly
been frightened by having williams sur-
prize him with uala treachery was what
williams expected from all men all white
ones he had thought gilbert lang dif-
ferent
  the boy was different from most men but
in them all was the streak of treachery so
though he might believe what was reported
ill of gilbert lang he saw no reason for ac-
cepting what was reported gallant of wins-
ton willerby he had never met wtillerby
but he had met men who told of willerbys
anything but gallant threats toward him
  is that all you have to say williams
asked through a strained throat though his
voice was not loud
  why yes dubeque replied surprized
disconcerted about all-
 then go to-
  those words came slowly deliberately as
if definitely ridding himself of dubeque
willerby and gilbert lang
  williams turned abruptly to the table
and sat down his back toward the door out-
side of which stood dubeque and banoo
  but williams dubeque protested
scarcely knowing what he would say next
but determined to say something anything
that might possibly get through the baffling
reserve of this man
    b u twil liams  he repea t edspeaking very
earnestly for he was in earnesti knew how
you feel about that boy and i dont blame
you i know the chance of you and wil-
lerby ever really being friends is too remote
to suggest i know you dont care what
willerby or anybody else that trades or re-
cruits thinks of you- the words were com-
ing easier now dubeque could see a clear
course of argument-but here is a chance
for you to meet willerby and you can tell
him just what his traders and blackbirders do
do he doesnt believe the reports williams
  weve all hinted at the way they rob
and kidnap but it makes him furious be-
cause he simply doesnt believe it and to
be honest with you all of us are afraid to tell
him the cold truth you are not and as i
told you before the old man admires you
you should hear the way he makes fun to
their faces of the officers that go poking
about in gunboats trying to locate you of
course thats only if none of his traders or
captains have recently had a run-in with
you w ws a queer old fellow williams
but he has a big heart he wants to meet
you he sent me over here to ask you to
come aboard this evening you can see i
came alone

adventure
  the last sentence was the most eloquent
hat dubeque had said it left to plain in-
ference much that no amount of words could
have made so effective
  now hurricane williams was for reasons
of his own an exile he had taken up with
and lived entirely among those who are called
savages because their society cast of mind
and values-hut more especially their na-
kedness-differ from those of the earths
dominant nations he hated white men
with an intensity that could not have en-
dured without being perpetually nourished
by memories yet tlie roots of his being ran
too deeply into the white race which had
borne him and his fathers to be torn out
even by all the strength and fierceness with
which he had tom at them
  his conscience was clear it was sheer
bitterness that made him hate liis race yet
he knew though he might try not to ac-
knowledge it within his own thoughts that
there were men other than the treacherous
dishonest brutal sneaking fellows it seemed
bis fortune to have always encountered
gilbert lang had seemed such a one it
was a surprize but scarcely a disappoint-
ment to hear that he was not however it
was a surprize to hear what he had of wil-
lerby
  he did not feel enraged toward gilbert
lang when a man has been disappointed
oft in much the same way he ceases to feel a
sense of injury against any one in particu-
lar but holds a grudge against the general
class as the misogynist misanthrope
anglophobe-or as in williamscase against
white men
  he wheeled on dubeque with the words
  ill go-as you came alone
  again the inextinguishable hope like a
fire that could not be tramped out or dead
ened by water lifted a tiny flame perhaps
willerby was such a man as dubeque had
said
  dubeque did not know it but he had his
battered features swollen lips and eyes
largely to thank for his success one glance
at his normal face and williams would have
distrusted him as it as williams did not
really believe him he simply did not en-
tirely doubt him
  williams went as he was that is naked
except for trousers cut off above the knees
and unarmed except for a sheath-knife with
lanyard to it which he could slip over his
wrist he wore the knife because it was
handy in the brush or water if occasion re-
quired it might serve to rip a shark wil-
liams was as much at his ease in lhe water
as any native and those of die coast are
practically amphibious
  he walked swiftly along the street and
dubeque was hard put to keep up with
him and though he spoke from time to
time williams did not answer
  not only banoo but a group of armed
natives joined him on the way and followed
to the end of the jetty
  before he got into the boat williams said
something to banoo that the white men did
not understand but one of the blade boys
at the oars heard and shivered he chanced
to be a samoan
  williams dropped lightly into the boat
and sat down dubeque followed with the
order to shove off
  mr grogan said dubeque too pleased
with himself to keep quiet this is mr
williams
grogan was embarrassed he
had no use for dubeque he won-
dered if williams could be the man
rumor made him out since dubeque had
brought him so easily dubeque had not
said that as an introduction-at least wil-
liams took no notice of it-but rather a
veiled wav of gloating however grogan
being of that rough class among whom an
introduction invariably implies a hand-
shake put out his hand and took it back
williams stared at him but said nothing
made no move
  mr grogan is one of our officers
dubeque hurried on explanatorially and ap-
parently a little afraid that he had made
what the french call a faux pas
  dubeque did not intend to conceal from
anybody that he had cajoled williams into
the trap he was proud of that but he
was quite sure that even willerby would not
approve of the mamier in which it had been
done if he knew of it that was really the
chief reason dubeque had dared to go
alone willerby would be furious to know
that even to serve his ends it had been said
that he ever admired williams or would
treat him otherwise than contemptuously
dubeque was something of an adept at
judging men he had unerringly one
might almost say instinctively made about
the only possible appeal to williams that
could have been effective
savages

  williams said nothing perhaps he sensed
the trap it would not have been the
first time that he walked into danger fully
suspecting all that was to come and
apparently both unsuspicious and unpro-
tected
  the nightly gaiety on the bebe floated in
drunken laughter and sportive cries to the
boat that was slowly approaching and shad-
ows glided and drifted under the brilliantly
lighted awning
  grogan called a heavy voice in a kind
of subdued tone as the boat drew near
  yez soir
  is dubeque with you
  im here dubeque called loudly and
so is williams
  jackson said something loud but indis-
tinct-something like an oath of surprize
that struggled out in spite of himself
  williams scrambled up the ladder swiftly
as a monkey runs up a vine less rapidly
but helped by eagerness dubeque came
after
  as grogan put his hand to the ladder the
samoan sailor spoke to him and the mate
stopped to listen in amazement
  williams said the loud-voiced jackson
  williams stopped and his eyes flashed on
jacksons bearded face
  you dont remember me
  no said williams gruffly abruptly
  just as well jackson replied i
never hold a grudge gainst a better man
than me then lowering his face he
added swifdy i dont know why you
come but look out
  and jackson turned with a cheerful
greeting to give dubeque a hand over the
freeboard
  aye skipper wan woird wid yez
grogan called up
  what is it grogan jackson answered
down
  oill bay r-right up and grogan came
fast and jackson waited but dubeque and
williams had gone aft at once
  on the poop there was that noise which
passes for gaiety the seven or eight peo-
ple who made up willerbys guests were
drinking and dancing existence on the
bebe would have been intolerable without
the elixir of heady wine not so much be-
cause they loved the wine-though they did
that too-as because of the insufferable
ennui which only the inspiriting grape
would cause to vanish
  dubeque flung himself up the poop lad-
der followed by williams
  oh w w dubeque called shrilly
elated heres williams
  for a moment those words seemed to
smother the lips of all who heard the
quick silence of surprize and no movement
but the turning of heads and craning of
necks then all edged nearer gaping vul-
ture-eyed to look upon the man who had
almost become a legend in the south
seas
  he seemed to fill the part that rumor gave
him naked fierce-eyed short-bearded with
hair unevenly carelessly cut short and he
stood firm-footed legs apart like a statue of
bronze every muscle was tense and the
body though not huge or even big was
gnarled with the knotted muscles which
were supple and smooth enough in his
quieter moods
  he was hedged about the women low-
waisted in flimsy gowns of rainbowed silk
gaped tipsily and the men in those gro-
tesque attitudes of surprize and drunken-
ness stared through frog-lidded eyes and
with mouths dropped
  then willerby drunk but scarcely show-
ing itr for like a barrel-the more solid
when filled-he seemed physically im-
pervious to wine in any quantity roughly
shoved his way through and on his arm
came lania forgetting the pose of tipsiness
which was nightly assumed to account for
the glasses she managed to pour overboard
inside the circle she slipped from his arm
and stepped back crowding against those
behind her sensing danger seeing it since
her eyes were clear in that bronzed body
that stood as if cast from molten metal to
convey lhe great artists idea of a dangerous
man at bay
  such refinement of perception was denied
the fume-blurred eyes about her for du
beque was as drunk with pride as any
other man with wine and jackson who had
quietly come up the ladder was some dis-
tance away and at williams back
  willerby swelled out planted both hands
on his hips and glared the great mo-
ment was at hand his sycophants were
about him waiting to listen
  but before willerby spoke williams did
he had been long ago or long as time is
valued in such a crisis disillusioned his
voice was hard and cold
  wheres that boy

adventure
  something resembling a shock was felt by
those who stood around here was not a
prisoner but a challenger
   willerby raised his voice and said slowly
as insolently as he could-
  he is where you will be - quick-
in irons then he continued his voice
quavering rhetorically like a poor actor in a
big scene for though he was not acting he
was sjeaking to the ears of the gallery gods
on his poop as much as to williams he
cursed the man spoke of the yardarm and
hemp mentioned white cannibals
  only once did williams take his gleaming
eyes from willerbys face he shifted them
for a barely preccptible instant as if to
mark the place where dubeque stood
  willerby at length paused for breath and
williams spoke again it was as if he
had not heard anything that had been said
except the first sentence
  in chains-why
  williams questions were like grappling-
hooks that jerked out answers by sheer
force
  because hes a friend of yours why
else do you suppose i offered to make his
fortune willerby went on in a slightly ag-
grieved voice as a missionary might say he
had tried to save an unregenerate sinner
but- the wine perhaps was a little con-
fusing to brain though not to his legs-he
told me to go to- and ill send him
there and you with him
     then it happened as men who
know of him say it always hap-
pened with williams as the hurri-
cane strikes with scarcely a warning for
those who are not watchf ul williams struck
he half wheeled an arm flashed out
dubeque was down unconscious for min-
utes and sickened for days to come
  cries shouts screams a roar of kill
him from willerby throwm to the ship at
large but more or less directly at the burly
form of jackson yells from amidships
women and men on the poop fearful yet
fascinated screamed and jostled but did not
turn away their faces and some drunken
hands half clutched at williams as he
bounded back from where dubeque lay
lania glided to one side only she and
williams were silent
  williams glanced quickly to right and
left then he rushed straight into the huge fist
of willerby taking a glancing blow on the
neck and going on right up against him a
hand steel-fingered closed on willerbys
f ull throat and a blow like the drive of a pis-
ton smashed into his face he dropped
  a swift backward glance over his shoulder
and williams wheeled to meet jackson
but jackson stopped jackson was no cow-
ard but lor one thing his heart was not in
in the fight he had plenty of sins on his
head but the gospel of fair-play was at least
faintly ingrained within him  besides he
had once been at grips with williams be-
sides still further sailors were swarming
from forecastle and amidships and grogan
was coming up the poop ladder perhaps a
little influence from all those things caused
jackson to stop he began to talk about
it and raised his hand in a kind of repress-
ing soothing gesture
  weve got you williams theres no
use making more trouble here come-
  a half smile seemed to appear on wil-
liams lips it may have been that he
merely parted them in a strained way to
suck his lungs full of air anyway his eyes
darted toward the top of poop ladder men
were coming sheer numbers would pile
him down
  he turned and lunged aft those in his
way were too surprized and slow to get clear
of his road and a man and a woman were
bowled over as ten-pins fly from the side of
the ball the little blonde crazily clutched
out at him with drunken luck her fingers
slipped into the waistband of his trousers
and tightened williams scarcely looked
around a back-handed blow and he was
free and her beauty was spoiled for a month
  then he leaped between taffrail and
awning he dived and into the water
  a rush to the rail shouting and pointing
to where the phosphorescent water like a
trail of fire-sparks marked his course
  the boat-after him-kill him wil-
lerby shouted hoarsely
  his throat was painfully wrenched the
windpipe seemed to have been almost
jerked out and as he came unsteadily to his
feet he felt as if the ship were swinging
and swaying in an oily sea
  tell that lugger to lower away too
willerby shouted again
  voices screamed across the water toward
the lugger that lay nearest but jackson
had gone and his was the only voice that
would carry easily now that willerbys was
choked down to hoarseness and the few
savages

men on board the lugger were slow to get the
order into their ears or through their heads
  the boat alongside was delayed a little in
getting away rifles were fetched then
it was found to be overcrowded and some
of the crew were sent up leaving just
enough to man the oars excepting jackson
and grogan a white sailor steered
  williams was a fast swimmer but he had
a hundred and fifty yards to go
  the boat swung out clear of the ship
grogan and jackson fired the mark was
not visible only the phosphorescent wake of
the swimmer and the bullets striking the
water-unless an almost spent ricochet-
rarely leave even a passing flashing of water-
sparks
  but after they fired the phosphorescent
trail vanished the water disturbed in swim-
ming smoothed out
  - did we get him jackson ex-
claimed anxiously
  oi shot hoigh said grogan and both
looked back a little apprehensively toward
the bebe where cheering and compliments
came from over the rail
  then the cheering died and shouts of
look there rose
  again the water betrayed williams after a
long dive
  jackson and grogan shot again and
again wiliams dived
  the lugger had lowered away
  -them said jackson glancing in the
direction of the reinforcements as shooting
began from that boat
  williams was swimming fast and his
dives were long but oars bent in the water
and the boats gained and gained there
was little chance of hitting him until the
boats were almost on top of him but they
would be there before he could reach shore
  then from the water and through his
cupped hands as he treaded it williams
shouted one word twice
  banoo banoo
  the shore suddenly seemed alive with
savages yells and howls the fire of rifles
and presently the streaks of phosphorescent
wakes as the canoes took to the water
  all gopassa was on the beach what
banoo and those with him had heard and
seen when williams left with dubeque had
rapidly been repeated and all the sa-
moans tongans and gopassans had come to
the beach where they had squatted and
talked wonderingly awaiting the dawn
  the pursuers were abruptly turned into
the pursued and the boats went about and
made for the ships as fast as the frightened
oarsmen could take them both boats
fired and in earnest but little harm could be
done in the darkness
  the water was alive with canoes and as
if all the fiends of hell were on it
howls and yells of derision taunts were
flung from the distance the lessening dis-
tance as the canoes swept on
  then there broke from the bebe a mighty
flash and roar the old brass camion split
the cup of heaven and its echoes crashed
amid cliffs and hills it had never failed to
intimidate natives and there was mo-
mentarily a quiet and hush when its thun-
dering echoes died away
  but shouts rose the shouts were from
banoo nauma and chief ghorki calling
their warriors home for williams had been
picked up and had told them to go back to
the beach the shouts set the howling and
yells loose again the canoes turned beach-
ward with much the reluctance that children
show in leaving a street-fight and cries of
derision at the white boats for fleeing
gave the natives a sense of victory
  were lucky said jackson in a throaty
whisper to grogan
  grogan loosened a big big sigh of relief
and some thick profanity too
  the old man wouldnt believe it so we
might as well say nothin
  r-r-right said grogan as he put out his
hand to steady himself against the side of the
bebe as the boat came alongside the ladder
  the samoan sailor who had overheard
williams speak to banoo had told grogan
and grogan had told jackson and they
being men who had often crossed williams
trail did not doubt that the sailor had been
right when he claimed that williams had
said to the savages on the jetty-
  if i dont come back blow up their ship
at dawm
vii
willerby- held a council of war
a number of things were decided
he decided them the others ac-
quiesced no matter what secret misgivings
they may have had
  first however everybody wanted to
know of dubeque how on earth he had
managed to get hurricane williams on
board the bebe

adventure
  for the moment dubeque considered
his broken jaw providential then some
one suggested lhat he write it out du-
ueque was really very miserable he did
not feel like writing one of the men not
entirely sober at the time who claimed
to have been a medical student in liis youth
took dubeque in band wrenched the jaw
painfully in locating the break swathed his
head in bandages and making a straw
oi oiled paper let him suck down a drink
  thereupon dubeque wrote that he had
gone ashore with the intention of putting
a gun to williams head and ordering him
to come along but williams had asked
about the boy gilbert and dubeque had
scud he had been put in irons williams
was angry about that but dubeque had
said he had better tell his troubles to
willerby williams said he would go right
on board and do that very thing and
dubeque had replied that it was just as
well because he dubeque had come after
him for the purpose of taking him back
without trouble if possible
  what send but one man after me
williams had exclaimed
  why not you are only one man
dubeque had said
   ill go said williams
  thus it all happened according to
dubeque
  that wras an adroit and plausible ex-
planation and seemed in its essential
features true but some of those who read
it wondered what would have happened
had dubeque not been lucky enough to
find williams in a humor for coming and a
few were inclined to think that dubeque
had been braver than they suspected in
taking the chance
  then willerby proceeded with his council
of war
  hurricane williams was to be wiped off
the face of the earth
  somewhere near in one of the many
bays and islets he had his ship that
must be captured li would in a way
serve as an indemnity for the trouble of
wiping him off the earth
  the gopassans must be stirred up to
make trouble for him and his natives
  what shell and pearls he had obtained
must le apprehended as they were more
or less anyhow the personal property of
willerby-or at least such was his feeling
about them
   but all of those were incidental to the
sale and sure move contemplated a ger-
man gunboat the print was some two
hundred miles away at shortland island
willerby knew the officers well and they
liked hjm-or rather had liked his wine and
friends with that far-sightedness that
always characterizes the successful man
of business willerby had foreseen that
german influence would be strong enough
to get a portion of the south seas and he
wished to keep on the agreeable side of
the germans in other words he foresaw
the coming agreement that would put some
of the smaller islands and bougainville
under the kaisers protectorate
  the prinz was now at shortland making
surveys of the little island morgusaia
with that methodical exactitude which
germans use in picking up the crums
dropped by empire-grabbing nations that
exhaustive survey and charting would add
weight to german claims in the south seas
the capture of williams would also be
very agreeable to the prinz and the ger-
mans would remember the favor willerby
had done them
   so it was decided that the next morning
the larger lugger should take on fresh
water get aboard a few of the best sailors
from the bebt and slip dowm the coast to
the prinz
   the next morning it was raining-as usual
   willerby and his friends lay late abed-
as usual
  grogan went on board the lugger as
skipper and found her in need of refilling
water-casks one way to fill them was to
go to the stream that flowed dowm to the
bay from around the east side of the
village another was to spread canvas
and catch the rain
  willerby awoke in an irritable mood
for one thing his throat was more painful
than ever instead of a glass of raw
brandy poured down by way of letting
his stomach know he was up he was
compelled to sip a hot toddy he went
on deck and found the rain he was tired
of rain it seemed to him that not even
noah had endured so much rain he was
in the mood for ripping somebody up for
something but the poop had already
been washed down and the brass work
shined there were no raffle about and
everything looked shipshape
  only a man who has looked for trouble
savages

knows how irritatingit is to find things in
order he looked out at the lugger why
hadnt she got under weigh hours ago
and what on earth were they doing
catching rain-water when a fresh water
stream was in plain sight he would show
them he would he sent for his speaking-
trumpet but at the first shout through it
he was reminded of williams fingers that
did nothing to relieve his temper
  he ordered the boat manned and over
to the lugger he went his voice was
rather hoarse and it was not easy to speak
but he spoke
  afraid of the natives was grogan well
in the name of all that was profane and
much that was obscene no niggers should
ever have the satisfaction of knowing that
winston willerby was afraid of them
empty those casks that had already been
filled and overboard with the string of them
he would send a guard along he would
do better than that he would send presents
too here was a chance to make friends
with the natives
  to hear him tell of it one would have
thought that grogan had been deliberately
trying to cheat winston willerby of the
opportunity of making friends with the
natives and having more or less stumbled
on to the idea he began to make the filling
of the kegs a great occasion
  so willerby went back to the bebe
trade goods were broken out bottles of
cheap whisky brought up rifles taken from
their oiled rags
  a bottle of whisky in one hand and a rifle
in the other thus does the civilized white
man ever meet the savage
  the native village was sleepy it had
been up the night before besides it was
raining
       and at dawn long before it was
bpgd time to get up particularly after a
late vigil baraka came into the
street prancing and yowling true he
had first gone to the hut of williams to
consult concerning affairs of magic but
williams was gone but the sun-maker
had been effective the day before so why
not again barak knew that his fees and
promises of pay for sun would not be forth-
coming if he did not make it stay out a
reasonable length of time true enough
he could easily have found a way to put the
blame on the villagers themselves
  there were a thousand little infractions
of tabu that could always be invoked as
having spoiled the delicate charms of the
devil-devil man but baraka no matter
what lack of faith he may have had in his
own wizardry put implicit confidence in
the strange box that williams had given
him so he went early into the street
swung his childs toy and made magic
  but it rained harder and harder
  baraka was an old man and he did not
like the exertion moreover he did not
like the rain it came in torrents
  he had committed himself so far that he
could not stop without rendering his village
a little skeptical true he could think up
explanations but explanations had to be
convincing and there were some of the
tongans for instance who did not believe
in his magic they made slighting re-
marks their influence was bad
  by eleven oclock baraka was pretty
much disgusted the rain swept down in
sheets it was a cold chilling rain too
  then he saw the boats coming for shore
and towing the water-casks he was sur-
prized other natives were surprized
here was something to be watched and
talked over there was a flurry of excite-
ment in the village were they coming
to attack should they be attacked
  neither williams nor banoo could be
found nauma had been given no in-
structions concerning such an emergency
and by nature he was-as most samoans
are-peaceable without being cowardly
the tongans are somewhat the same too
but the tongans are much more ready to
fight than any other peaceable folk per-
haps one of the reasons is that they do it
exceedingly well but the gopassans were
very much in doubt as to what to do and
moreover baraka who held peace or
war in any one of the gourds he cared to
peep into remembered the amazing wealth
that had been showered on him the after-
noon before by the generous jackson
  in some respects the native is much like
everybody else his appetite for wealth
if he is at all avaricious as devil-devil men
always are grows by what it is fed on in
some other respects the native is exceed-
ingly peculiar he buys children to raise
as his own from the bushmen with whom
he has an inveterate feud yet bushmen and
women come into the coastal marts and
purchase salt and-if they eat it-fish-

adventure
   in some places fish are regarded with as
much repugnance by bushmen as human
flesh by eurojjeans if a party of natives
board a trading-ship and one of them is killed
while trying on his own initiative to murder
the trader the others are likely as not
to go on bartering as if nothing had
happened such incidents have occurred
time and again the unfortunate native
aspired to win distinction and failed it
was his own lookout
  so it may be seen that their attitudes
may not be judged by white mens logic
anti in this respect it may not be amiss to
here mention the obscure sentence tucked
away in a little-known book that has con-
tributed enormously to the success of the
british empire in his majestys hints
to young officers on out stations it is
specifically pointed out that natives are
not inferior to white men but merely
different
   out of his long experience with natives
willerby knew that they were just about
as likely to greet him in a trading spirit
as with clubs nobody had been killed
the night before there was nothing to
have engendered a special feeling of bitter-
ness he rather expected that williams
would make trouble but that was a chance
he had to take if he wished to make trouble
for williams and he had come prepared
in the day his white men were easily the
superiors of the blacks as rifle-shots and
moreover he was in a way protected from
the ship by the brass cannon the roar of
which carried much farther than its missile
   he did not head for the jetty but for the
stream and the boats came stern-on to
shore and waited for some minutes not
a native appeared though everybody knew
the bush was full of them whether they
were to announce their presence with a
volley followed by howls or would come
slipping forward timidly with coconuts and
chickens for trade was to be seen
   presently a native edged into sight and
stood waiting he took that more or less
risky method of finding out whether or not
the white men would shoot at him but
jackson stood up and greeted him with
shouts of welcome and waved a bottle of
whisky to show friendliness other natives
came out they were urged to come closer
but were hesitant they were unarmed
which meant that they had left their arms
in the bush some ten or twenty feet away
   jackson and willerby climbs out and
 started wading up the beach behind them
 rifles were held just below the gunwales
 ready in an instant to fire if needed
   jackson and willerby carried whisky
 tobacco and fish-hooks they came up
 to the sand and waited holding out pres-
 ents but insisting that the natives come for
 them an animal-trainer requires less pa-
 tience than a irader the natives stood
 and looked now would take a step forward
 now retreat two now squat then stand
 walk three or four paces nearer stop go
 backward and sit down
   both white men swore feelingly but they
 knew it was part of the game and so wore
 their friendliest smiles and never ceased
 gestures of welcome and generosity
   and it rained rained rained
   then baraka came out he showed that
 he remembered jackson called to him
 and stood looking hungrily toward the
 bottle that jackson carried
   hi old boy you fellow come catch
him jackson shouted
   you no catchem for shippy asked
baraka inquiring whether or not jackson
was after labor recruits
   baraka himself stood in no fear of being
 nabbed by a blackbirder he was too old
 but the others were much disturbed about
 that and long ago both baraka and
 chief ghorki had forgotten what williams
 had said about there being trouble if the
 natives welcomed the bebe
   no no jackson expostulated him
 missionary shippy waving a broad hand
 toward the bebe no catch em black boys
 give whiky temback-plenty whiky
   there was nothing incongruous to native
 minds in that gopassans knew of mission-
 aries only by the vaguest reports good
 people but foolish throughout the south
 seas the missionaries are called foolish
 even when influential the samoan word
 for missionary is afoolaand mission-
 aries were often-perhaps are yet-im-
 personated by blackbirders
   come catch him jackson finished
   him fellow plenty catch and
 quick aided by pantomime pretty well
 dispenses with all interpreters the na-
 tives readily leam fragments of english
 they will under pressure leam a little of the
 oui cmi as they call french but it is as
 if there were a taboo on all german
 words they will not or can not leam them
savages

  baraka came forward carrying his childs
rattle
   here old boy get a little o this m you
said jackson opening the bottle and hand-
ing it to baraka who promptly drank long
and deep coughing and spluttering over the
fiery liquor but delighted
  other of the natives edged closer more
bottles were opened tobacco was dis-
tributed fish-hooks were handed around
a new supply of gifts was brought from the
boat the natives were thick about them
  come to shippy-any time-plenty
whiky said the generous willerby as he
passed out gifts with both hands but
no williams no williams boys no bad
  the unutterable badness of williams
was conveyed by willerbys face and
gestures rather than by liis words
  that a he said a shrill voice high-
pitched in rage
  jackson and willerby looked around and
saw a beautiful native girl poised in anger
flashing her dark eyes upon them
willerby had been long in the
tropics he had seen hundreds
thousands of native girls and been
susceptible to the charms of many but
at that moment he thought uala the most
beautiful of any he had ever seen it wras
nol true perhaps beauty like other things
that have superlatives is comparative and
the lithe samoan belle was resplendent
among the flat-featured women of the
solomons-blacker of skin than the poly-
nesians and often even when not in mourn-
ing plastered with lime
  oh ho said willerby
  whew jackson commented
  that a lie uala repeated misser
williams good man
  full o fire said willerby admiringly
  fie cast about for some present that
would be agreeable to feminine vanity but
when he looked up uala was gone and
she had disobeyed nauma by going within
speaking-distance of the bebe men but
the story she carried to his ears somewhat
palliated the offense bebe men were making
gopassans fool drunk and telling them
williams was bad man much trouble
would come sure and she hoped yaws
cramps bad dreams and sharks would get
every last one of the gopassans
  willerby did not lose sight of his main
purpose to poison the natives with whisky
and words also to find out what he could
about williams where his ship was and
anything else of the kind that might be
of value but familiar with native lore he
did not forget uala when he added pay to
generosity to get baraka to make him a
love-charm
  in no place in the world as among the
solomons are love or any other charms so
effective let a native know that a witch-
doctor has prepared a ghost-shooler
against him and that native will die let
a woman see a love-charm made with devil-
devil magic in the hands of a suitor and
though she be the wife of a chief she will
yield what the chief may afterward do
to her to her lover or if a bold chief to the
wizard is none of her concern she would
no more think of resisting the charm than
of entering a tambu house it simply is
not done and that is all there is to it
  willerbys big red face beamed with
pleasure as the natives grew drunk and
noisy he began to have hopes that
williams might be killed-scuppered-and
toward that end gave broad hints together
with pledges of valuable friendship he
was well pleased with his work and made
baraka well pleased with his attentions
he made sport of the childs rattle told
him williams had given him a womans
toy as an insult to the great devil-devil
spirits and truthfully enough tliat it
could not possibly affect the sun
  no willerby promised to give baraka
information concerning the weather from
day to day and not to insult the devil-
devil spirits by presents of a womans toy
and baraka was to make a love-charm and
give it to uala telling her that she could
not resist the affection of willerby it was
not usual for the wizard to have the suitor
present the charm by proxy but willerby
thought in this instance it was advisable
he did not care to remain until baraka
was sober enough to dabble with the magic
from his gourds
  the casks were filled the full supply of
gifts distributed and willerby and his
party returned to the ship
  as willerby came on deck flushed and
pleased he was met by lania who clear-
eyed and fresh carefully dressed was alone
under the awning waiting he forgot all
about the dusky uala lania was incom-
parable and she then showed a spirit a
vivacity which willerby could not see was

adventure
forced but which had been markedly
lacking in her for some time if lania
had done as she wished she would have gone
to her couch and wept she was torn and
liarassed as she had never been
  no woman is ever her real self-or dis-
plays it-except in intense anger she
wears robe over robe herself unaware of
the number that clothe her nakedness
sometimes in the ecstasy of her first love
she will very nearly bare her soul but for
her second and third and after she is dis-
guised as an actress and lania was old
in the ways of the world and like all
women who are-being more so than even
the tender wide-eyed maidens-she was
heart-hungry but being cynical-minded
knowing men and women too she was or
thought she was wholly disillusioned
  disillusionment often as not merely sub-
stitutes one illusion for another she hated
willerby she hated paul dubeque she
hated all whom she knew she thought
it was love-deep passionate binding
love-she wanted love that would anguish
her with intense delights women know
and always have known what psycho-
logists have only lately revealed to men
that delight is edged with pain women
are the more passionate and passion as
the etymologists will tell all who ask means
literally a state of suffering lania
wanted love that would hurt true love
it is called often by women who merely
misname novelty
  women have so many various textured
and colored vestments about their naked
desires that not even in sincerest moments
can they distinguish between what they
try to conjure to them and what they really
want
  lania had been loved she could not
remember the times her face had been
lighted by men whose passions for her
burned them up she had never loved
willerby at times she liked him yes
but he was an investment and the pleasure
got from his company was that of being his
favorite of wearing the black pearl ear-
rings of seeing other women envious
  but other men had struck fire from her
clive stanley-at any hour of night or day
that name streaked across her brain lania
felt something grip her flesh whatever
else may have caused that sensation there
was fear too she had loved him with
flaming passion-and grown tired in time
she always grew tired but clive stanley
-she had told him how she hated her
husband how he abused her mistreated
her and stanley the strangest man she
had ever known brilliant wealthy bitter
against the world had swept her into his
arms and carried her off
  but before he tarried her he made sure
that the husband would not follow the
dogs of justice had followed instead they
caught clive stanley and hanged him for the
murder of her husband they had hanged
him there was no doubt of that but
she was still afraid of him afraid that he
was alive there had been something
about the man that precluded the idea of
death touching him it was all rather
vague and superstitious but it troubled
her dreams
  also there had been within easy remem-
brance ballantyne the son of the english
lord that affair was only a matter of days
tense and ending in violence always
something violent seemed to attend her
he died she fled
ythen more recently there had been
another man she had tried to
rather than did love him she
told herself that she loved perhaps all of
her life she would think that she really had
at least she was grateful to his memory
he had been from the world of gentlemen
not of titles and registered blood but of-
there is no other word to convey it-gentle-
men though a man of some years and
traveling he had been innocent to believe
that one can tell enough about a woman
by looking at her by talking to her by
taking kisses from her mouth and-all
within a few weeks to make her his
wife
  lania had married him-but not until
paul had assured her that there were
enough reasons for believing him wealthy
to take the chance there were times
when she really thought that she would
have married him anyway but paul like
the devils advocate with the book of her
life under his arm stood ever behind her
ready to read her shame aloud and more
destructively than the horns of jericho
shattered any wall with which love-un-
profitable love-tried to hedge her about
  she had gone with her husband pleased
with his affection and joy rather than de-
lighted by her own the feeling of security
savages

and comfort charmed her at first but like
a sailor who has scarcely slept ashore after
riding out a typhoon before he grows weary
of lands solid footing so she wished that
life might be a little more lively than placid
dinners the quiet reserved conversation
of callers the boredom of dull theaters
she knew she did not belong among the
people to whom her husband had brought
her-and that they knew it no matter
how little they might show it and too she
grew aweary of her husbands satisfaction in
moon-gazing and the quiet words and
gentleness of his love-making
  paul grew more weary than she of con-
ditions he proposed a hideous relief
with combined fright and repugnance she
had rebelled but he had only to threaten
from the book of her life and she grew
quiet she did not agree she simply
became impassive-then it was more with
that instinctive impulse to flee which
possesses all persons who have seen a wrong
done taken even ever so passive a part in it
than with relief and desire to be gone that
she fled again to the vast seclusion of the
south seas and to willerby
  ever since her return she had been
inwardly discontented more so than ever
before willerby was so to speak un-
bearable-and paul dubeque more so
she wished to be well rid of them all
there was no way out money was not
lacking but it was in pauls hands with
foresighted prodigality he had seen to it
that her wardrobe was all she wished
but there was nothing beyond that yet
she was yet young full of lifes hot energies
also heart-hungry
  when she had first laid her eyes on
gilbert lang seen his clean almost beau-
tiful boyish face the gentlemanly though
youthful poise of him vague things stirred
within her the harder she stared at him
the less he seemed to resemble any one she
had met he seemed so far from wherever
he belonged-so astray and alone among
the men one met around the islands
something about him fascinated her and
was reminiscent of something-she could
not remember what she had not taken
her eyes from his face and the whole of that
night she had scarcely taken her thoughts
from him-and when she did it had been
to think of williams the berserker who was
evidently closely connected with the boy
  she feared that paul dubeque would not
hesitate to stick a knife into the boy and
she knew very well that willerby could
readily find a wav to have him dropped
overboard but paul was very much
concerned with his broken jaw and wil-
lerby too at the moment had other matters
on his mind
  the next morning paul stayed in bed
most of the others did too they sipped
coffee and rum on awakening and dozed
off again anything to put in the time
to kill it when they awoke again they
had another drink and when well saturated
with rum they would get up lania bored
as any but more far-sighted endured the
intolerable confinement of ship life without
recourse to stimulants in any such quan-
tities she arose to a bath and a few
minutes of deep breathing scrutinized her
face for wrinkles and plucked at the flesh
under her chin to see how distant was that
nightmare of the fleshy throat she wasted
as much time in one way or another as the
others did in bed
  when she came on deck willerby and
his boats had gone ashore there were no
sailors left but the while boatswain and
two or three natives to man the brass
cannon in case it was needed as usual
there was nothing to do there were some
minerva press novels scattered about a
few paper-backed french stories but lania
did not care for reading fiction bored
her and anything else was not always in-
telligible also as usual it was raining
  lania stood about for some minutes then
she hastened for the steward
  where she asked carelessly as one might
inquire for anything out of idle curiosity
was that boy
  he was in one of the storerooms irons on
his feet yes the steward had the key
why had he been put there the steward
did not know grogan had told him the
boy was to be kept there and the door was
to be kept locked certainly she could see
him
  the steward liked lania most men did
she was beautiful
when lania stood in the opened
door gilbert lang sat on the deck
his head dejectedly propped against
his hands about him were boxes and bar-
rels he had been given nothing to break
the hardness of the deck
  he did not look up until he heard her

adventure
voice saying to the steward that she would
be all right and that she would lock the
door when she left
  gilbert lang remembered her she was
the sort of a woman that is always remem-
bered black-haired black-eyed  a slender
oval face long lashes and red lips also
what might be called a multitude of hair
black glossy and fine vain as they are
of the glory womn will never realize fully
until they begin clipping it how much of
their feminine distinction is due to their
hair there never was there never could
be a clipped-headed sorceress lanias
hair had she worn it down would have hung
in massive braids and it was only by adroit
and studied arrangement that she escaped
a top-heavy appearance and made her
hair literally a crowning glory
  gilbert lang with some difficulty got
to his feet
  you poor boy she said unaffectedly
  what are they going to do with me
  i dont know they are brutes she
was not posing
  have they caught mr williams
  no hardly he- she stopped then
gazing at him intently-would you do
what willerby asked if he would turn you
loose
  he shook his head slowly and he looked
at her with something of disappointment in
his eyes as much as to say-
  that is why you came
  you wouldnt not ii they were going
to hurt you
  no
  you said he was no friend of yours
you said it two or three times
  he isnt what could be called a friend
he hardly ever spoke to me and some
way he seemed always angry it made
me very uncomfortable though i suppose
it is only his manner he hates white men
and i am beginning to understand why
did he hate you she asked
  i dont know he seemed to at times
i suppose he does-now
  gilbert lang was thinking of how wil-
liams had glared at him when he came upon
uala and him under the palms
  didnt any one tell you what happened
last night
  what happened no t didnt hear
anything did they get him
  then lania told of how williams had
come on board the bebe-and left
  he must be a wonder i gilbert lang
exclaimed admiringly for lania had not
in any way minimized williams blows
  men call him a hurricane how did you
come to be with him mr gilbert
  mr lang he corrected gilbert
lang
  then it was as if lightning had struck
lania by the flash of the bolt that
stunned her she saw what it was about
gilbert lang that had stirred vague things
within her they were no longer vague
the heart-hungriness that had seemed to
pull her toward him was rather the hungri-
ness and memory of his brother frank
lang this boy was her brother by law
and the name of gilbert as that kid
brother of mine had often been on franks
lips
  there was scarcely a family resemblance
for gilbert was the more delicate but
there was much suggestive of his mother
lania had sought him out largely through
restlessness and not through passion but
within her was the feeling that she could
love him except for a certain untar-
nished youth it ws not because of gilbert
langs personality but because of her own
discontent
  he saw that she was very much agitated
and he asked what was the matter
  hers was a quick brain
  i overheard willerby and paul say they
would have to put lang out of the way
kill him i didnt know that was your
name i thought it was gilbert oh
 wont let them kill you i wont
  fire flashed in lanias eves her body
stiffened she meant it of course she
had overheard nothing of the kind but
while she had swiftly fabricated that in-
formation to cover her own agitation she
nevertheless knew that either paul du-
beque or winston willerby would readily
enough kill the boy but that did not
begin to explain her attitude there was
that deep deep feeling of gratitude amount-
ing to a tenderness more pervading than
any emotion she had ever called love
for gilbert langs brother he had been
a gentleman and though his presence was
sometimes wearisome the memory of him
his devotion courtesy worshipful inno-
cence was dear to her
  in retrospect she appreciated him his
home his father and mother and in her
retrospective bitterness at dubeque for
savages

having robbed her of those things-much
more precious viewed from the tedious deck
of the bebe than when they had been within
fingers reach-she neglected to remember
utterly forgot and would have denied that
she had been guiltily acquiescent in the
murder true there had been the book
of her life from which dubeque threatened
to read but had she loved frank lang or
been another kind of woman she would
have dared the harpies given herself over
to be plucked by scandal and cast out and
have saved him from the poison which
dubeque-her cousin not her brother as
had been pretended under the name of
brown-had managed to procure against
emergency from an old devil-doctor of the
santa cruzians-the most artful of south
sea poisoners
  it did not at once occur to her why
gilbert lang was in the south seas the
thing that did bear in upon her was that
this boy should not be harmed without
at all reasoning the matter out-women
seldom reason anything out-she flamed
up with resolution it was as if in a
vague chaotic way she would try to atone
for the wrong done his brother but she
had no clear idea of doing that she did
not even think of it perhaps it might be
said that she felt it
  what women feel and what they think
do not necessarily have a logical con-
nection the enigmatic quality in them
intuition that so baffles the male is like
the magic catpels of arabian wizards and
carries them instantly from point to point
  why asked gilbert lang simply but
convinced should they want to kill
me
  because they are that kind of men
you hit paul that is reason enough for
him and that paul wants to do it is
reason enough for willerby and she very
nearly voiced the wish which was sincere
that williams had killed both
  but look how they treated me
  can you swim she asked
  he shook his head
  i dont know how you can get away
then
   bui may not williams make them give
me up i feel awfully for saying i was no
friend of his and-
   he can do nothing if he comes any-
where near the ship they will kill him
   but surely men dont commit murder
like that isnt there any law nothing
it was of himself as much as williams that
he was thinking
  the solomons are not like philadelphia
gilbert lang war-ships make the laws-
and willerby tells the officers what is right
and what is wrong and he usually keeps
them so drunk that they believe him
how did you know i came from phila-
delphia he exclaimed
  it was a perilous slip but she did not
hesitate
williams said so i dont remember
just how but he mentioned it in some way
i dont think i ever told him where my
home-
  you must have she said definitely
listen i am going to bring you a revolver
if anybody tries to hurt you shoot ill
see if it can be arranged so you can get
away
gilbert lang did not know
what to say he was in the posi-
tion of believing her while feeling
it was unbelievable that anybody should
wish to kill him he was grateful to her
but surprized at her intensity she was
a stranger to him yet there was a certain
indefinable intimacy about her a kind of
intimate familiarity which combined with
her peculiarly vivid beauty added some-
thing to his feeling of depression gilbert
lang was not cast in the heroic mold
whatever courage he may have had was
not the sort that made him a man of easy
adventures and he had none of the facile
gallantry that carries men along dashingly
with strange women
  he thanked her but she seemed scarcely
to hear him she went away and came back
with a revolver loaded lania gave it to
him urging him not to hesitate in using it
  she had some difficulty in not venturing
into dangerous questions it flashed on
her as strange that gilbert lang should be
in the south seas yet she rejected the idea
that he had come to search her out first
she did not think it likely that she and
dubeque had been tracked westward
and also being unable to imagine how little
gilbert lang had known of the south seas
she could not believe that he had come
into them their myriad islands and great
distances to look for her and dubeque
  she did ask why a boy such as he was
there
 -
 
ay
i
adventure
  gilbert lang answered evasively even
as he looked at her wanting to say some-
thing of how his ironed ankles and the
danger from willerby seemed merely the
persistence of the tragedy that had come
on his family
  and she in turn could hardly repress the
name of alice blown thinking of how
she could pretend to have known miss
brown and to have remembered miss
browns mentioning a philadelphian fam-
ily of langs but common sense restrained
the name
  she left after urging him again not to
hesitate to use the revolver if he saw he
was in danger nothing had been said
that let him know dubeque was in any way
tied to her by blood nothing tliat had
revealed to him her name she seemed
a very wonderful woman but in thinking
of her he thought of uala and to think of
the two at once was in a degree to compare
them not critically not appraisingly but
as one might set side by side to view at once
some piece of earthwork out of tuscany
and porcelain out of limoges he flushed
at remembrance of uala yet the charm
of her was evoked by the flush
  when lania had left him she went back
to the poop to await the return of willerby
she was very agitated and perturbed know-
ing scarcely what to do-in fact scarcely
knowing what to hope for then the devil
thrust a thought into her brain that thrilled
and frightened supposing paul dubeque
were artfully egged on to remember his
threat against the boy and the boy killed
him it would be the fate he deserved
and she would be rid of dubeques spectral 
sinister shadow she did not decide upon
it but nursed the thought tentatively and
itcame to seem less revolting
  she soon regarded it as less of her own
planning than that of nemesis of justice
those seeking desired ends through violence
always manage with more or less sincerity
to put the full responsibility to god
destiny or the abstraction justice it
is as if something innate within most
of mankind shrinks from murder until-
as savages with their own hands make
monstrous images which can only be
satisfied with an altar-heap of dripping
heads-they have created some idea that
not only sanctions the killing but often
commands it vengeance by the avenger
anyway is always looked upon as an un-
masked headsman who wears the insignia
of justice
  lania never gave such matters as these
even a trace of thought but by the same
psychological processes just mentioned she
arrived at the feeling that it would be right
for dubeque to die by the hand of gilbert
lang
  and so almost resolved thrilled appear-
ing vivacious but agitated she stood
awaiting the coming of willerby
  and he came proud and boastful he
gloated over the way he had turned gopassa
into a drunken village seduced baraka
into dislike for williams and prepared what
he thought would be death-dealing trouble
for the alien samoans and tongans
                                   to be continued
agent amy
   iby
this sell a boggs
author of the cool hand
carrick superintendent of the
northern division of the r s
 t railroad had the reputa-
tion of being an obstinate man
one difficult to persuade from any view
but his own and it was said of him that
he never forgot anything good or bad
this being the case it is not strange that
he should keep in mind the first dereliction
of andy peck agent at belham
  it was in the spring of the year 
that superintendent carrick started out
with the general manager and several
general superintendents and a number of
other officials of high and low degree on a
trip of inspection they came to belham
on their special train and found the station
locked and the agent absent they waited
and fussed around for the better part of
ten minutes the general manager and the
other high officials casting coldly question-
ing glances at the fuming carrick and in-
quiring of one another-in distantly om-
inous voices that they made certain the
luckless superintendent would hear-what
sort of a doings was this but no agent
came and the inspection of the belham
station was abandoned the special rolled
away with its indignant passengers
  you may be sure that a subsequent
investigation came oh yes and this
investigation brought out the fact that
while tie high and mighty members of the
inspection party were wasting a precious
ten minutes in vain waiting for andy peck
ldan kurries inning elc
to come and let them in so they could
have a look-see said andy was calmly
stretched out on the chair in a barber-shop
several minutes walk distant from the
depot receiving certain tonsorial atten-
tions
  you kept us waiting for that stormed
carrick kept us waiting while you got
a shave and a hair-cut
  and a shampoo corrected young andy
with proper humility
  his face was perfectly sober though
inwardly he was feeling somehow mighty
pleased with himself for this you must
understand was before he had met ina
the millers daughter and learned responsi-
bility
  its the most outrageous thing i ever
heard of gasped the superintendent
glaring
  business was slack murmured the
wicked andy and i didnt know you
were coming he sighed if roud only
sent me word
  carrick glared some more send word
indeed-and spoil the very purpose of the
inspection
  well see he cried and pounded the
top of the desk well lay vou off for
thirty days for this offense and mind
this if ever again i find you absent from
your office when you should be on duty
ill discharge you completely
  so andy got his thirty days but he
didnt care-enjoyed the enforced vacation
	adventure
in fact in those thirty days he got properly
acquainted with the folks of belham
town-to which he hail but shortly come
and best of all he met black-eyed ina
daughter of duncan the miller
  the more he met ina the more andy
became convinced that this belham job
was just the thing for him and as the
days passed ina came to agree with him
so by the fime summer had gone and early
fall had come things between them were
pretty well settled
  theres lanes little bungalow he
said one evening itll be empty the first
of november
  well- she hesitated coloring prettily
  set the day he insisted
  well-yes all right she placed her
hand on his arm just give me a day
or two to decide andy she said-just
like a woman
but the very next afternoon super-
intendent carrick dropped off a
slowly moving freight as it passed
belham depot he tried the waiting-room
door it was unlocked and he entered
he tried the office door it was locked
  he rattled the knob of the office door
vigorously no response he peered in
through the glass of the closed ticket
window no one in sight he went
outside and peered through the front office
window where he had a complete view of
the interior no person was within
  ah ha said carrick and went back
into the silent waiting-room and seated
himself
  a half-hour passed no agent forty-
five minutes still no agent the super-
intendent rose stumped out of the building
and started to walk down the track
  on a short siding just west of the station
stood six camp-cars the quarters of the
members of the steel gang at present laing
steel rail near belham and all colored-
brought from the south during the past
summer as carrick was passing one of
the cars he heard voices speaking behind
its closed door he paused
  i don know mistuh agent said one
speaker  steamboat he say-
  dont you listen to steamboat cut
in the unmistakable voice of agent andy
peck you listen to me im telling
you the truth
  carrick waited for no more he shoved
  that door open with a bang seated on
the edge of a wooden bunk were two colored
men-one with a bandaged foot the other
with a wrapped-up hand on a soap-box
opposite them sat andy
  is this where you spend your time now
asked carrick grimly
  the agent looked a little dismayed
 i can explain- he began	
  come out here interrupted the super-
intendent ive something to say to
you
  the agent descended from the car and
followed carrick out of earshot of the
big-eyed colored men the superintendent
stopped and faced peck
  you remember what i told you last
spring he said firmiy to the agent
you ve been absent from your office for
at least forty-five minutes this afternoon
i know because i was at the station waiting
youre done-fired
  but you ought to let me explain
remonstrated andy i was working for
the interests of the r s  t when i was
in that camp-car just now
  likely scoffed carrick
  peck flushed
  yes sir jje affirmed steadily these
steel gang boys are threatening to quit and
go back south theyre worrying about
the coming winter up north here-afraid
if they stay theyll freeze one of the gang
is egging the others to go-a fellow they
call steamboat jackson ive been trying
to queer his efforts and persuade them to
stay thats why i was talking to those two
men when you came
  carrick listened incredulously until andy
finished his tale
  bosh he snapped
  its the truth declared andy
  he kept his mind fixed on ina and thus
was able to choke back the hot words
that surged to his lips
  no matter said carrick shortly fi
dont believe theyll leave-and even if
they should its none of your affair your
business was to stay in your office and take
care of tilings there anyhow you re
done ill have a man here in a couple of
days to relieve you
  andy saw it was useless to talk any fur- v
ther to the headstrong superintendent
  very good he said
  turning on his heel he walked toward
the depot
agent andy

n
yit was that very thursday eve-
ning that track supervisor quinn
of the maintenance-of-way depart-
ment entered the superintendents office
at wharton division headquarters twenty
miles east of belham
  i dont know said quinn to carrick
abruptly but im afraid our colored steel
gang is not going to stick with us now
that theres a nip of frost in these fall morn-
ings theyre getting restless their thoughts
are turning back to their sunny south
  carrick looked up quickly recollection
of what agent peck had said that afternoon
flashed through his head
  you think so he said frowning
  yes returned quinn theyve an
exaggerated idea of the severity of our
northern winter thats one trouble
and another is that theyre continually
being stirred up by the more shiftless
restless spirits among them-by one man
named steamboat especially if we only
could discreetly eliminate both troubles
  more confirmation of what peck had
said carricks face grew more dour
but no difference he decided relief agent
manott had already been instructed to
relieve peck the coming monday and
anyway these agents ought to learn their
place peck had not been called on to take
a hand with the steel gang
  that agent at belham was saying some-
thing along the same line he observed
aloud however
  andy peck said quinn yes he
knows good boy been trying to keep em
straight it will be little less than a calamity
for us if we cant hold them he went on
now that practically all the foreigners
have gone back to the old countries to get
in the big mix-up over there-and even
those who didnt have entered the mills
and factories-our last reserve our last
hope is the colored labor from the south
youve said yourself that we absolutely
must get this new rail laid to stand the
heavy traffic thats coming this winter and
next  spring the old steel that were
replacing is done for as you know if we
should be compelled to try to make it stand
up under the demand that will be made
upon it were going to be left in a sad
state
  carrick knew that this was sober truth
 
but he refused to be convinced that the
steel gang situation was serious
  its probably just talk he said i
dont believe theyll actually go
  im afraid of it persisted quinn
however i believe that if we could
eliminate the uneasy element that keeps
the others in a state of unrest we could
calm their fears about the coming cold
weather but the eliminating would have
to be done in a most diplomatic manner
the whole gang is at the skittish point
ready to jump at the first move that looks
suspicious to them if we fire one and he
goes the entire crowd goes thats the
way i figure it
  well said carrick what are you going
to do about it it was plain that he still
was skeptical about the supervisors fears
  im stumped said quinn glumly
im worried sick about the whole busi-
ness he walked toward the door and
im expecting therell be some sort of a
crisis within the next few days too
  oh bother said carrick its prob-
ably nothing but if you really are
alarmed do whatever you think best
  i would said quinn if i only knew
what was best im trying to think up
something
  he went out
m
the steel gang was holding forth
down at the far edge of the station
platform gathered in a ring at the
edge of the circle of light made by the single
platform lamp there
  the early october moon tipped the
eastern hills the evening still was warm
after the balmy windless day by morning
the colored men might be shivering under
jack frosts caress but tonight their hearts
were light the reason was simple the
coming saturday less than forty-eight
hours away would be pay-day so now
this thursday evening by turns they
clogged buck-and-winging with fantastic
and grotesque shufflings of the feet the on-
lookers applauding with boisterously en-
thusiastic cries at frequent intervals their
voices rose in song-wonderfully har-
monious vibrate with natural melody
  andy peck having nothing much to do
just then but wait until the last evening
passenger-train no should arrive stood

adventure
in lhe waiting-room doorway and for a time
dispiritedly watched the merrymaking down
at the far end of tlie freight house lie
certainly was feeling blue
after supper he had stopped
in at duncans before returning
to lhe station ina had met him
at lhe door by his expression she imme-
diately perceived that he brought bad news
  our wedding is off-for a while he
blurted out ive been fired
  oh andy she faltered how why
into her sympathetic ears he quickly
poured his sad tale
  the nasty old thing she said in-
dignantly when he had finished id just
like to get my fingers in his hair a minute
id shake some sense into him
  it is indicative of andys extreme misery
that he did not even smile at that-the
superintendenls crown being so devoid of
hair that it would have been impossible to
get anything approximating a grasp of it
  i was looking at lanes bungalow too
she continued just this afternoon -its
--its the dearest little house she put
her face close to his couldnt we-
couldnt we be married anyway andy
we could he replied but we wont
not till i get a job
  you could find one afterward she said
ill find one first he had answered
and forthwith he had lorn himself away
  for despite his firmness he felt himself
weakening and that he felt was a poor
tiling to do under the circumstances
in consequence andy now
brooded in the doorway of the
station while he contemplaled the
steel gang presently he strolled
toward them found a spike keg
lying near the side of the freight house
up-ended it and sat down just outside the
circle of light one memphis joe was
performing at the time directly mem-
phis-as he was called for short-cut a
final figure in his clog and concluded his
whirl
   nough he cried and dropped down
against the freight house close to where
andy sat
  cries now arose for steamboat steam-
boat faces were turned expectantly
toward the side of the ring directly opposite
the agent
lively
down
  git in steamboat hit er up
  shake dem feel steamboat
  show us-all whut you got
  but sleamboat jackson burly and tall
and extremely black morosely shook his
head of all the crowd he was lhe single
man-besides andy-who appeared down-
hearled

in his voice

andy abruptly

andy and then as memphis kept silent
he added they tell me steamboat is a
bad actor when he gets going good
memphis cast a wary glance at the
sullen glum steamboat

fajj on friday afternoon steamboat
imui jackson sprawled in the sunshine
just around a protected corner of
the depot building heard a rapid put-put up
the tracks a quick glance in that direc-
tion revealed to him that the sound was
made by supervisor quinns motor speeder
as it swiftly drew nearer the station
steamboat quickly decided it might be
best not to let the supervisor see him lying
around the depot instead of being out
laying rails with the rest of the steel gang
not that steamboat cared much-but it
would save useless talk
  at once the colored man rose and slunk
around to the back of the depot building
it being too late for him to regain the shelter
of the string of camp-cars that the
steel gang used he paused near the
rear window of the agents little office
  the supervisors speeder drew up to the
station and stopped stepping off quinn
lifted the wheels from the rails and rolled
the speeder back from the tracks then
he entered the station going into the office
where andy peck sat at his desk com-
pleting his daily accounts as the after-
noon was rather warm the agent had
slightly raised the rear office window for
ventilation the voices of peck and quinn
carried out clearly to the squatting steam-
boat
  hello andy said quinn howre
things today
  poor responded the agent rotten
this was so different from the usually
blithe andys speech that the supervisor
stared in surprize
  why he exclaimed whats the
trouble
  been canned jerked out andy yes-
terday-by the right honorable mr car-
rick am waiting now for the relief man
expect hell get here about monday
tell me about it pressed quinn
  peck did when he was through the
supervisor whistled softly
  the dickens he said he was silent
a moment of course i cant say much-
but you know how i feel
  thanks replied andy but lets talk
about something else whats on your
own mind today
  trouble too said quinn nothing
but trouble im trying to fix a way to
get these steel gangers to stick with us
foreman walsh tells me theres open talk
among the men that most of them are going
to leave right after they get their pay to-
morrow its that steamboat fellow whos
prodding them to it
  i know theyre nervous said andy
as  told the old man yesterday i was
down in that camp-car doing a little pro-
paganda stuff but he couldnt see it
  i understand said quinn warmly
i appreciate what youve done even if he
doesnt he paused if we could only
eliminate that steamboat without scaring
the others off i believe we could hold em
just now it looks as if his influence over
them was great enough to get them to do
what he wants but if we could get rid
of him in the right way or could overcome
his influence in some manner i believe
theyd stay here

adventure
  have you anything in mind
  oh i have a little scheme answered
quinn but ill admit i have my doubts
of its success anyway thats my chief
reason for coming to see you today
  lets hear about it urged andy
  its just this were going to try a
little psychology on the steel gangers-
going to pay them in cash tomorrow instead
of with the usual checks a bunch of bills
in a colored mans hand looks a lot bigger
to him than a little slip of paper even if
the paper is worth as much
  i see said peck youre figuring
that when a man sees all that ready cash
in his fist and realizes that he can get as
much more every two weeks if he stays on
the job hes not going to be so ready to
leave right off
  exactly stated the supervisor you
can see for yourself though that its not
much to base our hopes on but were
going to give it a trial
  how you going to pay them asked
andy
  thats where you come in answered
quinn were going to send a special pay-
roll out to you and let you do it
  but how about the money questioned
andy wheres it to come from
  at this question the attentive steamboat
pricked up his ears
  thatll come with the pay-roll sheets
replied quinn his words reached steam-
boat distinctly sheets and money will
be done up in a package and will reach
you tonight on no  thatll give you
a chance to go over it and get things
lined up befefre the men call tomorrow
morning the money will be in bills-
about three thousand dollars
  a sort of gentle sigh escaped steamboat
three thousand dollars many many
times the amount that would keep him in
comfort in luxury over winter to-
morrow hed draw around forty dollars
that forty dollars plus seven dollars and
thirty cents-the latter amount almost
wholly the result of a recent lucky session
at craps-represented his total assets
steamboat sighed deeply again three
thousand dollars he hearkened once more
to the conversation within the office
  all right agent peck was saying
let it come ill do my best-even though
the old man has given me the can i
havent any safe here though to keep
the money in overnight and theres no
bank in town
  take it home with you
  no objected andy thatd throw
me responsible if the stuff should dis-
appear
  there was silence for a moment then
quinn spoke
  in that case then i expect the only
thing to do will be to conceal it some
place here in the office it ought to be safe
enough especially as no one else needs to
know its here
  it ought to be assented andy any-
way thats what ill have to do
  sure itll be all right said quinn
he walked toward the door well ill
have to be moving along hasnt been
any trouble since last pay-day has there
men behaving
  no no trouble since replied andy
the colored boys are doing as well as
could be expected i guess
  just what did happen last time asked
quinn i never did hear precisely and
ive been wanting to ask you trouble
with the townfollc wasnt it
  yes a few of the steel gangers got a
little too much gin and made some excite-
ment up-town  wasnt there myself
but the next day i heard thered been
threats made some of the white folks
were for coming down here and cleaning
out the camp-cars i heard they claimed
theyd do it if the colored men started
anything again
  thats the deuce of it-when they get
a little booze said quinn well lets
trust theyll behave but if anything
should break loose you wire to head-
quarters and well get some of our raijroad
cops out here quick a man cant fool with
that sort of thing no telling
  all right responded andy but i
guess theres not much danger mostly
hot air i expect
  hope so said the supervisor but
dont take any chances so long ill
drop in tomorrow and see how things are
working out
       v
it wras shortly after dark friday
evening when andy peck stepped
around the end of the station to get
the baggage truck there and pull it out to
the front ready for no s arrival loud
agent andy

laughter and singing came from most of the
camp-cars that stood on the siding west
of the station the car that stood nearest
to the depot was that wherein steamboat
jackson and some of his special cronies
abode andy paused and listened for a
few moments from this last car came
the loudest of the sounds-and the sounds
were neither those of laughter nor singing
high declamatory voices sounded there
and the words that floated out were plenti-
fully besprinkled with oaths
  a voice came from the rear comer of the
station close at hand
  mistuh agent
 yes answered andy the voice
though low-pitched was unmistakably that
of memphis joe what is it memphis
step over close here please i don
want none them other steel gangers see me

gloom of the corner
  whats the matter memphis

  memphis spoke with conviction

an some colored folks lible do most
anything wen they gits the booze theyll

  thats bad said andy frowning in the
darkness
  yes suh affirmed memphis goin

boat an his crowd goes up-town folks
there most likelyh chase em back down
here to the camp-cars then therell be

yes suh thats jest whut i figger but
ise not said nothin yet to nobody but
you
  cant some of you stop steamboat and
his bunch
  no suh boss ise fraid not aint
no colored man goin tackle steamboat-
not no time an least of all wen hes
drinkin
  the door of steamboats car was flung
open while andy stood considering and a
broad beam of light shone out a roaring
voice-steamboats-reached them
   ise not goin low nobod- interfere in my
bizness no suh if i want go up an
buy me a lil drink thas my bizness an
aint no white folks goin stop me cant
nobody-
  the door was slammed shut again and
the roaring voice and the howls of approval
were partially shut off andy looked
around to where memphis joe had been
standing but memphis joe was moving
away-a deeper shadow in the shadows that
lay along the side of the depot that
roaring voice obviously had been too much
for his nerves
  memphis called the agent
  but memphis paused not
  you do whut you kin mistuh agent
the words floated back from the retreating
steel ganger pleadingly might be yo
could call on the company foj help
  memphis joe faded around the far comer
of the building and was gone
  andy worried and perplexed hauled
the truck out to the front of the station
and then entered his office he went to
the key of the train wire and called dis-
patcher potts whose office was at wharton
   some of the steel gang men are threaten-
ing to make trouble tonight he said when
the dispatcher had answered his call
could you get some police officers out here
soon
          yes-likely replied potts
what seems to be the matter andy
they got some booze and are showing
signs of going on the war-path liable

adventure
to be a battle on between them and the
townfolk if things are not stopped
  the devil said the dispatcher plainly
aroused stick there a few minutes and
 call you
  peck waited impatiently it was five
minutes before the dispatcher called
  captain caney of our police force was
still in his office spelled potts hes
gathering up several of his men and theyll
leave here on a special likely a light engine
inside of ten or fifteen minutes that
means they should get to belham inside of
forty-five minutes
 good said andy theyll be
needed
  we got hold of superintendent carrick
and supervisor quinn too theyll be on
the special no actual trouble yet is
there
  peck held the key open a few seconds
so carrick was coming he wondered
if the superintendent still considered what
the steel gang did as none of his-andys-
affair he thought of ina and his spoiled
wedding-day and his jaw set grimly
when he came the old man better not say
much or he might hear something
  he tapped the key again
  no he said to potts but its liable
to break soon judging by the signs tell
em to hit the ball
  they sure will hold the gang down
if you can till they come and keep me
posted as much as possible
  i will promised andy good-by-
here comes 
  he dashed out of the station as the train
drew in and pulled his truck up to the
express-car door several small boxes of
express matter were unloaded and then
the messenger handed peck a sealed
package
  heres a package the wharton people
told me to be sure to get to you tonight
said the man in the express-car sign
here
  andy signed the messengers book and
the train departed lie ran the truck
around the station dumped the boxes into
the wareroom and then reentered the office
the sealed package under his arm it
was he knew the package containing the
pay-roll sheets and the money with which
the steel gang was to be paid
  as andy entered the office an unseen
pair of eager eyes outside watched him
closely through the rear office window
the furtive glistening eyes saw the agent
place the package on his desk and examine
it for a moment but the agents next move
was not so pleasing stepping to the front
of the office peck pulled down the shades
of the two windows there and then moved
to the one rear window and pulled down
that shade
   the silent watcher in the darkness outside
moved back as peck approached the last
window and he muttered in disappointment
as the blind was lowered fortune though
seemed to favor him for near the bottom
there was a small slit in the worn thread-
bare shade quickly the watcher applied
an eye opposite the slit he muttered
triumphantly he could see in
  the shades drawn peck approached the
stationery cupboard that stood against
the wall at one side of the office opened
the doors of it and from a shelf took a
stack of large envelopes next he took
the sealed package shoved it to the back
of the shelf and replaced the envelopes
where the had been then he dosed the
cupboard doors
  that done andy glanced at the office
clock it had been  when he talked to
the dispatcher it was  now the
special should be on its way he went to
the key and called
   has the special started he asked potts
  just pulled out answered the man
who ran the trains things all right yet
  yes as far as i know replied andy
im going up-town now and see how
affairs are developing will try to get back
here soon and report
t
      there was a perfect buzz of
excitement around scanlons hotel
as andy peck drew near the hotel
stood on the main street between the post-
office and a general store and was several
squares from the depot the barroom was
a long room at one side of the building
on the street corners near-by different
small groups of belham citizens stood
talking low and seriously and eying the
windows of the saloon
   as peck approadied the side door of the
barroom the door was pushed open from
the outside and a man went in-steamboat
andy was a little surprized because he
agent andy

had supposed that steamboat and his
crowd were already all within their camp-
car had been dark and silent when he left
the station he stepped to the door him-
self pushed it open an inch or so and put
his eye to the opening
  standing lined up along one end of the
bar were half a dozen of steamboats
fellow steel gangers steamboat was just
joining them and they were greeting him
with noisy sallies at the other end of the
bar stood big noonan an oil-well driller
and bclhams cock-of-the-walk near him
stood five or six other town men all of
them watching the steel gangers and
muttering to one another their faces
frowning their eyes unfriendly in back
of the bar was scanlons barkeeper plainly
ill at ease
  give us all lil drink o gin white man
called steamboat to the barkeeper
the words as he uttered them were
deliberately offensive there was a slur
to them an innuendo on the white man
the barkeeper hesitated glancing at the
frowning faces of big noonan and his men
steamboat swaggered closer to the bar
step long white man he said loudly
whut you fraid bout
  the barkeepers face flushed he took
up a bottle from the array behind him
  andy tarried no longer at the door
he let it swing to went around to the
front and entered the hotel office from
an inner room proprietor scanlon himself
entered the office as peck stepped in his
face was anxious its ruddy glow was a
shade paler than usual
  scanlon exclaimed peck just the
man i want you must refuse to give
those colored men out there any more
booze
  he jerked his thumb toward the door that
led from the office into the barroom
  scanlon shook his head
  id like to peck but im more afraid
to refuse than to give it to them theyve
been acting ugly ever since they came in
but theyll only get worse if they keep
on with the stuff remonstrated peck
first thing you know therell be a riot
on remember how it started before
  i know exclaimed scanlon he threw
up his hands but i cant-
  a shout interrupted him-a shout that
came from the barroom mingled with it
was the crash of breaking glass then a
roar arose deeper shouts and the sound
of shattering glass was redoubled
  my - cried scanlon listen to
that
  andy leaped for the barroom door and
swung it open scanlon close behind
the barroom was filled with the furious
clashing of bodies all lights save a single
one above the bar were out smashed to
bits fists thrashed about vigorous pro-
fane phrases were uttered aloud and then
in a second something flew through the air
there was another crash-and the one
remaining light vanished
  come on boys called big noonans
voice come on get outside everybody
go get his gun well go down and clean
this black camp-car bunch out right
  a yell of approval came from what must
have been the white belligerents there
was a rush in the darkened room and the
outer side door burst open the sound
of swiftly moving feet came to the tense
andy and proprietor scanlon apparently
the steel gangers had followed the belham
citizens out for the barroom became silent
then before peck or scanlon had moved
the barkeeper appeared his face white
  what started it demanded scanlon
seizing the mans shoulder
  that nigger-that steamboat-tried to
shove big noonan aside-and called him
a name stumbled the frightened bar-
keeper then noonan landed on him-
and they all waded in
  that was enough for andy he waited
to hear no more things he felt were
moving too swiftly for him to control
he ran out of the office down the street
popped into a side alley and legged it for
the depot he saw men running cries
carried to him some of the shouts he
thought sounded as if they were coming
from steamboats crowd-defiant cries
he ran his best
  there was confusion around the camp-
cars as peck neared the station-high-
pitched chatter figures flitting in and out
of the doors andy avoided the cars and
came to the depot quickly he unlocked
the waiting-room door entered and snapped
the lock again behind him entered the
office and closed that door also
  upon leaving he had turned off all the
inside station lights now he did not re-
light them he had raised the shades
before departing and a platform light just

adventure
outside shone ihrough the front office
windows making enough light for him to
find his way about in the familiar office
he opened the train wire key
    shes broke he said to the dispatcher
the fight is on started up-town and is
working this way last lloyvs the special
coming
  shes getting along replied potts
quickly ought to show up there inside
of ten minutes
   if she doesnt do better than that shes
liable to find nothing but pieces left said
andy
   shes rolling assured the dispatcher
anybody hurt
  cant tell-hope not answered peck
he paused as a sudden fusillade of shots
rang out somewhere up around the camp-
cars theyre shooting now he said to
potts
  they are flashed the dispatcher
are you in any danger yourself boy
  guess not lied andy and he smiled
a little
  he had heard several things plunk
against the station right after the volley
of shots the marksmen were shooting
high and wild and hitting the depot
  watch yourself began potts-and
that was as far as andy paid any attention
to what the dispatcher was saying
  there was a sudden crash at the rear
window of the office glass flew in a
shower over the office floor
  hoky breathed andy and at once
dropped to the floor crouching down in the
obscurity and protection of the comer at
the end of the telegraph desk
  several lesser crashes followed at the
window as if something were being used
to knock out the ragged pieces of glass left
sticking there after the first blow then
a black blur abruptly appeared between
the broken sashes and a figure dropped
quickly inside the office a faint ray of
light from the platform lamp outside fell
on the intruders face
  steamboat jackson
the agent crouched lower in his
corner astonished but silent
  without an instants delay steam-
boat moved to the stationery cupboard he
jerked the doors open reached in and
pulled out a bunch of big envelopes he
reached in again brought out something
else and laid it on the ledge of the ticket
window dose beside the aiplward dark
as the office was the agent knew what the
colored man had placed on the window
ledge it was the package of pay-roll
money
   a sort of savage ejaculation of pleasure
came from the steel gang man as he put
down the package of money but he did
not linger over his rejoicing from the
cupboard then he quick pulled out
envelopes tissue sheets and various sizes
of paper forms these he pulled apart
swiftly and pijed on the floor in a heap
about the corner of the wooden cupboard
there was the scratching of a match and
a little burst of flame flared up steamboat
reached down and touched the flame to the
edge of a sheet of paper in the heap that he
had made
  steamboats back as he stood at the
cupboard had been turned to andy peck
the agents amazement at the colored
mans entrance had only been increased
by his further surprize at steamboats
bringing forth of the money-by his sur-
prize that the man should have knowledge
of it and of its hiding-place
  and then as steamboat piled the paper
on the floor some flash of explanation
came to andy-some perception of steam-
boats true reason for inciting the riot if
steamboat had started the trouble pay-day
night after receiving his wages the agent
w-ould not have been so perplexed andy
had wondered though why the fellow had
cut loose tonight the night before pay-day
but now he knewr
  up around the camp-cars the shouts
had risen in volume but so far there had
been no repetition of the shooting as
steamboat struck the match and bent
forward andy peck silent as a cat rose
on the balls of liis feet as the match
flame was touched to the paper he grabbed
his stout-legged office chair from the floor
beside him and swmng it in the air
   you treacherous devil cried andy and
brought the chair down on steamboats
head
   the blow was true but the colored mans
head also was true-to type the steel
ganger staggered erect as the swif tlv spread-
ing flame on the floor lit up the office
surprized and slightly bewildered he was
but his eyes flashed wickedly as he faced
the agent
agent andy

  ill tear your heart out he roared and
made a lunge at peck
  try it invited andy swinging his
chair again
  and this time he didnt aim at the head-
he aimed a smashing sidewise blow at the
black mans shins steamboats legs were
swept from under him like straws he fell
to the floor with a tremendous thump his
howls filling the office
  oh name o god he moaned don
do that don do that no mo mistuh
agent
  agent andy chair poised again held
back
  will you be good he demanded
  yes suli yes suh groaned steam-
boat only jes don hit my laigs no mo
  there was an abrupt grinding of brakes
out in front of the office before andy could
say more and a hissing of steam un-
perceived the special had arrived-a light
engine the waiting-room door flew open
with a crash as stout shoulders were set
against the locks resistance there was
a tramping of heavy feet inside andy
flung open the office door carrick quinn
capt caney and three other men swept in
flashlights and pistols in hand
  peck cried the superintendent amazed
at the sight in the office what in the
devil whats this fire we saw it through
the window
  but peck was all business he had a plan
in mind
  watch that man on the floor he ex-
claimed grab him up and make him
walk and without further ado he
snatched up the office water bucket and
dashed its contents on the burning heap
of paper the fire by that time had been
licking eagerly at the stationery case
but the water was sufficient the flames
abruptly expired
  come along wte got to hurry cried
andy then he grabbed up the package
of pay-roll money from the ticket window
ledge and thrust it into quinns hands
hang on to that he said
  capt caney meanwhile had hauled the
abject steamboat to his feet peck clutched
the colored mans other arm pushing and
tugging he started for the door
  amazed and not comprehending they
seemed all to recognize andys leadership
in a group they burst out of the station
and headed toward the near-by camp-cars
caney and peck in the lead dragging the
reluctant steel ganger between them
  whats the idea grunted caney as
they stumbled on whatre you work-
ing at
  wait panted andy fnot time now
to explain have to get this thing headed
off before some one gets killed-if some one
hasnt already been you just follow my
lead and back me up
  the moon had come up since andys
hasty return to the office from up-town
revealing the camp-cars and surroundings
clearly as the party approached all lights
in the cars were now out the cars occupants
lurking in the obscurity inside
  as the party rounded the end of the
string of cars the belham citizens gathered
in the shadow of a warehouse at the head
of the siding apparently mistook them
for charging steel gangers a shout arose
  here they come boys it was big
noonans voice out and at them
there was a mighty shout in answer
and the belliamites leaped out for battle
from steamboats darkened car an answer-
ing cry went forth and some shots flashed
out andy peck dropped steamboats
arm and jumped ahead of his party
  keep back men he shouted to the
oncoming townfolk keep em back
noonan everythings all right now
the belhamites recognizing pecks voice
and perceiving their mistake as to the
partys identity faltered and came to a halt
only noonan pressed forward
  what he cried that you andy
yes replied the agent just hold
your men a minute im going to fix
things
  he turned and grasped steamboat by
the arm
  tell your men in that car to let up
he commanded sternly tell them to
come out here quick
  steamboat overawed did not demur
he faced liis car
  come on out geoge he called de-
jectedly come on you an all the boys
fo the lan sakes that you steam-
boat said one in the car evidently
geoge his head was cautiously sticking
out an open window we-au been won-
dring wliar you been
  its me admitted the gloomy steam-
boat
  youll not be harmed put in peck

adventure
to the men in the car and when you
get out here ill tell you where steamboats

  from the car next to steamboats a
voice now spoke-memphis joes voice
coming from the doorway
  am that you mistuh agent
  it is answered andy get the boys
all out memphis and bring em here
nobodyll get hurt
  a joyous whoop came from memphis
and in a second he and the other men in
his car tumbled out arriving on the ground
as soon as steamboats crowd from other
cars steel gangers did likewise whooping
as the word spread they gathered to-
gether near where andy carrick quinn
steamboat caney and the other officers
stood quietly now perceiving that some
strange thing was happening the belham
men and big noonan edged nearer lining
up on one side of the agent and his party
while the colored men lined up on the
other
you men have been easy marks-
suckers said andy addressing
himself particularly to steamboats
wondering rather sheepish-looking half
dozen steamboats been making you
play tricks for him-tricks so hed get the
good things and youd get nothing did
you know that george
  whut you-all mean nervously said
george a tall rangy buck
  why you know how steamboats been
blowing he was going south this winter
with a pocketful of money but he hadnt
got his pocketful today though he must
have learned some way that i was expecting
a package of cash on this evenings train
he decided that was just the cash he
wanted
  so he got some booze managed to get
you fellows worked up and finally got a
good-looking riot started then while
you men did the fighting he sneaked down
to the station broke in found the money
and tried to set the station on fire the
fire would be blamed on the riot see-
and his theft of the money would be
covered up but i happened to be in the
station and steamboat came to grief
  a stir-as of resentment-was visible
among the half-dozen
  fo lawds sake steamboat said
george am that right
  but sleamboat made no answer he
merely hung his head and mumbled un-
intelligibly
  sure its right declared andy look
at him and you can tell for vourselves
and of course you dont know what the
money steamboat tried to swipe was for
do you george
  no suh answered george
  well ill tell you its pay money
thats to be us-ed to pay the steel gang men
tomorrow thats the kind of man steam-
boal is he was going to take it all and
you fellows wouldnt have got any-not
tomorrow anyway youd have had to
wait several days longer until another pay-
roll was fixed up
  this time the wave of resentment that
swept over the steel gang was not confined
to the men from steamboats car it went
over the entire crowd and there was a
muttering of imprecations and threats
seeing their bad-man subdued the rest
of the gang felt emboldened
  but andy had turned away from them
for a moment he faced big noonan and
the belham men
  you see how it is noonan he said
this steamboat man here is really the
only one to blame-and well get rid of him
he prodded on a few others for the reasons
i just gave but most of these colored
men didnt want any trouble one of
them came to me just before train-time
tonight told me he was afraid steamboat
was trying to stir up something and asked
me to do what i could to stop it
  id say you did what you could
boomed big noonan you certainly
stopped it
  hurrah for andy called several of the
belham citizens behind noonan
  and three cheers were given exuberandy
and then to the embarrassed agents
confusion they were echoed by the steel
gang side but agent andy kept his wits
he faced the colored men again
  and now that the fuss is over and youre
going to get your money tomorrow the
railroad wants all you men to stay he
cried all but steamboat its he thats
been making all the trouble-filling you
full of lies about the cold weather and
trying to scare you out-just out of pure
devilishness you stick with the railroad
and theyll see that youre kept warm-
get lots of coal and plenty to eat here re
agent andy-

the big bosses-the superintendent and the
supervisor theyll tell you the same
 andy turned to the big bosses
 how about it gentlemen he said
 he looked at quinn and then he looked
 at carrick when he looked at carrick
 andys eyes were a little defiant
 but the superintendent was not slow to
 respond
thats right he affirmed loudly
what the agent said goes well take
care of you its a promise will you
 stay
 there was a half instants hesitation
 then memphis joe spoke
yes suh he shouted ise goin
stay we-all goin stay wtiat you-all say
big boys
 he turned to his fellows and a great
 shout of affirmation greeted him
goin stay roared the steel gang
goin stay
 thats the stuff called carrick en-
 thusiastically wed count on you every
 one
he faced about to where andy peck
stood and then--for the first time in his
 ife so far as any man there knew-he openly
confessed to an error
 son said carrick quietly ive made
 a mistake im just beginning to get an
 idea of what youve done here for us and
 if im not too late i want to ask you to
 forget what i said the other day-forget it
 and stay here on this job will you do it
 andy could scarcely believe his ears
 somehow the possibility of anything like
this had never occurred to him for a
moment the thought swept through his
head that here was a most excellent oppor-
tunity to say something that would scorch
carricks hide but consideration of ina
and knowledge of what his staying would
mean to her and to him checked his tongue
-if not a certain sense of whimsicality that
always was lurking at the back of his brain
  ill be so pleased he murmured
it was somewhat less than ten
minutes after he had given the su-
perintendent his answer that andy
came to the residence of duncan the miller
he was about to press the bell when the
door flew open and ina came out appar-
ently bound for somewhere in great haste
she stopped abruptly at sight of him
  andy she exclaimed ive been so
worried and afraid-all that noise and
shooting i was just going out to hunt
you
  you neednt now he said his face
beaming im here
 is-is everything all right she ques-
tioned seemingly a little puzzled at his very
obvious joy
  all right well i guess yes he
seized her in his arms were going to
have our little bungalow after all little girl
  andy
  yes indeedy he cried old man
carrick is going to keep me on the job
and-
  but that was as far as he got just then-
for reasons that may be surmised

 i vein of platinum on a jade
  ring was the river mfunyaballa
flowing through the forests of
a m the french congo above the
place of a thousand islands is a slight rise
of ground like a furry tongue protruding
from the cavern of the forests brown with
the huts of the village of basayaguru
  on a hot afternoon when the only moving
things were the scraggy goats lazily scratch-
ing open-beaked native chickens and
chromatic lizards a faint throb vibrated on
the sulky air like the pulse of a distant
drum a yodeling cry from the steamy
cavern of the forest caused the village to
swarm with lithe ebon figures whose heads
were decorated with frizzly hair built a
foot high above the forehead streaming with
long-bladed spears in their hands like a
flood of ants to a point upon the riverside
again came the cry from the forest from
down the river the distant throb grew
into the eh ahh eh ahh eh ahh
of the chant of paddlers presently around
a bend appeared a canoe as the host of
natives squatted in silence came stalking
solemnly a tall figure with an ivory comb
like a dagger stuck through the head-dress
of hair and carrying an express rifle in
the midst of his people he sank upon liis
haunches gazing from a masklike face
down the river with lhe eyes of a repressed
child the strange canoe hugged the far
bank of the river indicating by neglect of
the rowers to avoid the sweep of the stream
that they were uncertain of their reception
  amidship of the leading canoe was a hood
of woven grass from which protruded the
helmet of a white man when the canoe
was immediately opposite the village the
paddlers backed water and a tall man
garbed in white calico with a green turban
after the arab manner stood up in the bow
and chanted rapidly in a loud voice the
mob of natives watching gravely on the
beach listened in silence when the stran-
ger had ceased one cried back and was again
answered by a chant and a signal made with
the right hand raised
  immediately the tall chief with the ex-
press rifle rose to his feet cried out imperi-
ously and sat down the canoe continued
up-stream for fifty yards swung round
came diagonally across the current and
nosed its way through a flotilla of small
and large canoes upon the village strand
  from the canoe sprang a short slender
man clad in weather-worn khaki and wear-
ing a small dark beard the chief rose to
his feet as the white approached and raised
one hand murmuring the arabic word-
  sduwmav
  salaarnaj responded the white 
  as he raised his hand in the salute his
quick dark eyes were upon the express
rifle
  solemnly the chief turned and led the
way through the mob of his people up the
hill to an open dusty space littered with
goats chickens and calabashes where
stood a thatched roof upon half a dozen
poles the palaver-house opposite to each
other upon carved wooden stools with the
white mans interpreter in the green turban
beside him they began the formal palaver
  after more greetings and the solemn
sniffing by the white man of the snuff
proffered in a tiny gourd the young chief

the tree of life

indifferently accepted presents of several
bales of cloth and a snider rifle with cart-
ridges during the interview the white
mans sharp eyes were unobtrusively
noting details the interpreter informed
him that the chief had graciously permitted
the strange white man to camp in the open
space of the village
  the white recalled the topographical sur-
roundings and after swift reflection he con-
sented knowing that except for field clear-
ings in the dense forest there probably was
no other ground suitable for a camp these
matters having been arranged the chief
intimated that he would present the cre-
dentials to his august father basayaguru
which entailed the presentation of another
snider rifle as the young chief rose to
depart the white man eyed the express as
the warrior handed it to his superior
  fnotice that  ali he commented
to the interpreter as they continued to sit
in the shade while their equipment was
brought from the canoes dyou think
there are any white traders round here
allah is all-wise responded ali mo-
hammed perhaps the person has traded
it from the south sir
  south exclaimed the little doctor
briskly these people are not nomadic
are they ive understood from the agent
at kavaballas that no whites have yet
been here district only touched by oc-
casional countrymen of yours isnt that
right
  allah is all-wise repeated ali mono-
tonously blinking both eyelids but my
countrymen are not disposed to carry
weapons of that kind doctor
  urn um muttered the little doctor
hi he shouted in broken kiswahili
pointing his cane make those men
clear up this ground before you pitch the
tent fahamshi  tell em ali this
ground is nothing but a bug-preserve
he took out a cigar and lighted it whats
the particular pet superstition here ali
same as below or a new pope or something
 allah is-
   asked you what you think snapped
the doctor
  i do not think sir returned ali
imperturbably the savage think many
things that they dream
  dream dream he glanced at ali
and grinned like a friendly terrier through
his short beard um youre right all
this ju-ju business is merely the projection
of a dream
  in my country that is what our wise men
say
  do they begad then theyre a-
sight wiser than ours um um ali
do you know what particular legend they
have here
  no doctor admitted ali i do not
there are many strange and mystical
things in africa
  mystical tommyrot snorted dr herd-
wether i dont believe you know much
about it all
  only allah knows the truth
  i didnt bring you here to know allahs
opinion upon every- thing from yams
to folklore as soon as you possibly can
get them to talk
  they will not tell us said ali for
these peoples always seek to hide their
cult from the infidel eyes of strangers
um um well try confound it try
the energetic little man jumped to his
feet inspected the tent sniffed disgustedly
and walked with short nervous steps to
the outskirts of the village with the object
of seeking another site free from native
garbage and the ubiquitous flea but there
seemed no hope for the up-river side was
as unpromising as he had observed the down
side to be
  the river swirled around the small
peninsula and away on its main course
leaving a series of flat swamps and tiny
creeks crocodile invested worming into the
dense forests in all directions from the
land side of the village was a vista of regi-
ments of tree-stumps in native fields
hewn out of the primeval forest fields in
which women-many with babies wrapped
in skins upon their arched backs-worked
diligently with the small native hoe pre-
paring the ground for the annual sowing
away high over the sullen edge of the forest
soared lazily a pallid halfmoon
fw back through the village noting
gjiujg the square hut of arab influence
surrounded by a small palisade with
a large wild fig in the center the little doctor
tramped batting at the myriad flies as
perspiring and hot  he plunged into his green
canvas chair his personal boy emerged with
whisky and a sparklet siphon each ges-
ture of making drinking striking a match

adventure
lighting a cigar and the tones of the voice
irritably demanding the preparation of his
rubber-bath was observed solemnly by the
circle of boys and warriors tickling their
curiosity while their wives mothers and
sisters toiled in the blazing sun in the fields
  as the purple shadows elongated came a
procession from the hill led by the tall
chief basafingu advancing to within
three feet of the white man he squatted
down his followers placed before him
two elephant tusks of great weight and good
condition according to the etiquette of
a great chief the little doctor pretended
not to notice their presence for some
minutes he continued to smoke his cigar
interested in the swelling of the sun as it
sank within the humid atmosphere above
the trees
  as silently and abstractedly sat basa-
fingu and his ebon retainers from another
green tent the replica of the doctors
emerged ali in the green turban and a
green gown and stalking with much dignity
sank upon a stool beside the doctor without
as much as a twitch of the eyelid to ac-
knowledge the presence of the young
chief in impressed silence the audience
of warriors and boys and children watched
the statuesque poses of the actors at last
ali gravely permitted his eyes to rest upon
basafingu and turning very slowly ob-
served quietly
  there appears to be some of the savages
bearing presents for you doctor probably
it would be as well to observe them now 
  probably it would assented the doc-
tor this sort of thing gets on my nerves
you bargain and begin the debate ali
  permit your eyes to see them and i will
speak
  the doctor accordingly turned his head
and regarded the gathering with a bored
stare after some five minutes of formal
greetings ali observed
  the chief basayaguru the father of
this person sends you these unworthy and
trifling presents nod your head with the
utmost carelessness doctor perfectly ad-
mirable sir he intimates that he will be
pleased to receive you in audience upon the
morrow before the sun is yet high nod
again if you please and i will dismiss these
savages
  ali made the set reply whereupon the
young chief apparently impressed re-
sponded and rose but when the bearers of
the tusks had departed in his wake there
remained an old man whose head-dress was
not so high as those of the young men and
was like a bunch of greasy white wool
the face was wizened and as finely net-
worked with lines as knitted black silk
on each side of the tufts of white wool
which was his beard swung lumps of quartz
as big as a walnut suspended from the
distended lobes skeleton arms and limbs
protruded from his robes of wildcat skins
he bent liis bead after the manner of an
arabic salaam until he revealed the scraggy
wrinkles on the back of his neck then he
spoke mumbling toothlessly-
  this exquisitely wrinkled person ob-
served ali intimates that he is a doctor
sir
  not of divinity i trust queried the
little man with a twitching lip
  it is injudicious to exhibit levity in the
presence of the ignorant admonished ali
gravely
  perfectly correct ali perfectly correct
but what may the creature want
  he is i deduce the tribal medicine-
man
  oh a brother witch-doctor begad
um er-just the beggar we ought to
make friends with eh ali what does
he want
  as ever in this world among the infidel
he wishes undoubtedly a present of worldly
goods of some denomination
  talk man for heavens sake talk
snapped the little doctor or i shall have
to go into the tent to laugh ask him what
the current ju-ju is
  the moment is most inopportune
retorted ali woodenlv with your per-
mission i will instruct yamagulu to present
him with two knives and a small bale of
clolh and your most august respects
  all right but add a snider to the re-
spects and find out how much we can
buy him for
  the time is most injudic-
  never mind try him
  as you wish doctor
  after commanding the head man yama-
gulu to bring the presents specified ali
engaged the witch-doctor in polite conver-
sation regarding the exalted status of the
white chief all that appertained to him
and the imaginary objects of the expedi-
tion the rifle and goods were brought
and placed at the feet of the old man who
the tree of life
t
apparently remained unaware of them
at length yamala the witch-doctor made
his adieux and rose leaving the presents
upon the ground to be collected by his people
  well what did he say demanded the
doctor
  in this case doctor i have considered
it inexpedient to obey you
 -you
  i wish to remind lhe doctor that i have
lived and traded among such savages as
these for a period of fifteen years therefore
it is lo be presumed lhal i may possibly
be permitted lo be belter acquainted with
them and their minds lhan the doclor
possibly ali but-well this confounded
beating about lhe bush irritates me
  the doctor will permit me to remark
that if he persists in applying the occi-
dental attitude lo lhe oriental mind the
chance of gaining the desired information
economical and social will be considerably
diminished thereby
  youre a dear exclaimed the little
doctor showing his teeth in a grin but
-all right ali go your own way but for
heavens sake dont mull it
  as allah wills observed ali and turned
his bronze arab-somali features toward the
two tusks appraising ihem with bright
expert eyes have you remarked doctor
the exceptional generosity of the chief
these tusks are considerably over one
hundred pounds each and therefore at the
present market-price of value considerably
over one hundred guineas never have i
known any of these savage chiefs to recom-
pense a stranger so disproporlionately to
the value of the present bestowed never
doctor
  all right ali so much the better for
you keep em my boy only dont forget
to pump my ancient medical colleague
  a thousand thanks to you doctor
said ali salaaming i will assuredly en-
deavor to recompense you to the best
ability
  oh shut up ali i like you but youre
a bore sometimes hi yamagulu whisky

u
violet twilight stained with green
died hurriedly leaving the dented
moon as if battered with the bore-
dom of the chiliads to gaze incuriouslv
upon microcosmical contorlions from the
village of basayaguru rose continuously
like puffs of invisible steam from an engine-
exhaust the rhythm of a drum above the
murmur of the forest and the swirl of the
river in the sulky air
  like the red eye of a familiar winking in
masonic import to old yamala the witch-
doctor squalling like an idol carved in
ebony was the glow of the little doctors
cigar as he sat in the doorway of his tenl
in lhe lee of the greenwrood fire half in
shadow beside him was ali his robes a
volume of carven lurquoise supporting the
dignity of his turbaned head a cameo in
lazulite
  now ali said the doctor its really
about time you got to business weve had
a week of this fooling weve got a general
idea of the supply of ivory and that your
confounded people ruined the vine rubber
ages ago but wre could have got that
almost anywhere now try to find out
exactly what is the basis of their cult-
whether it is the same in this part as down-
country understand
  it most usually is so doctor responded
ali
  well but you dont know i want
facts not suppositions
  i still venture to doubt whether the
moment be expedient yet objected ali
tonelessly
  do as i tell you confound you
  the occidental and the oriental-
  shut up
  very good doctor but you will
please note that i do not take the responsi-
bility i obey
  as tonelessly as an oracle ali spoke
fluently to the old man yamala who at
length replied as monotonously
  the witch-doctor states that they have
a goddess who dwells in the woods
well
  please to contain your most natural
emotions reproved ali it is not the
custom of the orient-
  oh-the orient
  please to be patient remonstrated ali
and began anew to talk with the witch-doc-
tor
  the old man rumbled on in periods punc-
tuated by assenting grunts from ali the
doctor finished his cigar and lighted an-
other yet slill lhe lwo voices blended as
if in a liturgy to the rhythmic throb of the
single drum and the faint anthem of the
io
adventure
mosquitoes the old man ceased and re-
lapsed ito immobility
  well well what is it
  ali was undoubtedly in a state of excite-
ment indicated by a slight half-tone raise
in the timbre of his voice
  these peoples have as you know
doctor been much influenced by the in-
cursions of my own people they were at
one remote period the storehouse of our
slaves although in these days of your
exquisite civilization one is compelled to
take tribute in the form of merchandise
only i desire to point out that our ancient
truths have influenced even these savages
you have interrupted the doctor
dryly get on
  the occidental are not the ways of the
oriental-
  ah shut up and get along with the
yam
  i hasten to obey doctor i desire to
state that these savages have confused an
ancient philosophy with their own ig-
norant superstitions
  never mind that what is the super-
stition
  as you will doubtless have read or
learned doctor each of these peoples have
with scarcely any exception a belief in the
spirits of the trees and the rivers the
correct word flees from me
  animism
  thank you doctor animism but
in this case they have confused-
  confound it grumbled herdw-ether
never mind that
  they as i wish to express believe in
the spirits of the wood and the plants
they have tlft priest tells me here a
sacred and holy tree which is the mother-
i desire to express that it is the mother
well you have what about it
because all other trees are male
  the devil they are trees have sex as
well as anybody else
  indeed true words as your exquisite
education has taught me but not with
these peoples it is that i wish to express
that they have confused their superstition
with the truths of my peoples the berbers
as may and yet may not be known to you
doctor the berbers of the atlas before the
coming of the true believers-
  meaning your crowd eh
  indeed surely doctor the berbers i
may state had faith in the mother of the
universe the sun which is they said with
admirable logic the source of heat and there-
fore of all things and therefore was fecund
and therefore was a female the mother of
all
  what the devils that got to do with
this ju-ju idol
there is no idol doctor it
is a tree
what
  truly indeed what doctor the priest
here informs that upon the mother tree
depends quite and undoubtedly logically
frm their point of view the crops and all
that is grown and therefore their alimen-
tation
  yes yes the old idea from jack in the
green to the flarnen dialis well
  and therefore with exquisite logic that
it is necessary for the tree to be fertilized
and therefore to be married at the
first moon of the sowing wrhich is close unto
us nowr is the ceremony of the marriage of
the magic tree
  married to whom
  to whom the sacred tree is married i
can not say such is without doubt as in
all religions a matter forbidden to infldels
and the ignorant
  well buy the information then
  it is not possible to buy faith with
one thousand pardons i will express myself
for the reason of my excitement replied
ali as coldly as the liturgy according
to my wav of thinking the priest is most
friendly disposed toward us indeed he
has invited-even more in the limits of his
language-he has prayed that we stop to
see the ceremony of the marriage of the
sacred tree
 um urn mumbled the doctor
scratching a mosquito-bite on his left ear
but do they usually invite strangers to
witness these sacred rites
  undoubtedly not undoubtedly not
doctor that is also one reason for the
state of excitement in which you see me
um um the red eye of the doctors
familiar glared ferociously at the carven
image in ebony by the dull embers the
throb of the drum pulsed steadily it
appears to me that there must be a reason
behind the invitation what can it be is
it money i mean more presents yet
theyve been most unusually lavish already
havent they
the tree of life

  more than exquisitely lavish asserted
ali the reason is known to allah
confound allah
  the doctor is unconsciously blasphe-
mous reproved ali
  no its a gift i assure you grinned the
doctor um um well about the cere-
mony business what else did he say
is it not sufficiently astonishing that he
should tell us these things the doctor
does not perceive the exquisite abyss be-
tween the occidental and the oriental
exquisite twaddle is there a sacrifice
these devils invariably want lakes of blood
to bathe their gods in
  that is unknown to me doctor
  well ask him confound it
  his lips will be tighter than the shell
upon the ocean shore but if it amuses the
doctor i will hasten to obey
  again there followed the solemn litur-
gical conversation the doctor moved rest-
lessly as if the continuous beat of the drum
sought his pulse
  the doctor will observe that my words
are as true as the koran the tongue of the
black priest is swollen which is to say as
the doctor will perceive that he refuses to
speak concerning that which is to him
sacred and forbidden
 tabu eh um well ask him di-
rectly why he wishes us to see the ceremony
whether all strangers are invited or whether
he has just taken a fancy to our pretty
faces
   hasten to obey but the product thereof
will be excessively more lies than the leaves
on the sacred tree his ears as i have in-
timated are made deaf by the clamor of
our words reported ali he intimates
exquisitely politely that he would retire
with the offerings of the white chief saying
that the bird of happiness will bang her
wings in his breast so excessively that he
will not be able to sleep because the white
chief has willingly taken the acceptance to
the marriage-feast
 um well tell yamagulu to give
him whatever you think ali and bundle
him off to bed	
  ahs voice raised to summon yamagulu
then appeared muffled as if deliberately
hushed by clammy hands of the air on
which rolled with the rhythmic certainty
of an atlantic swell the somber notes of
the drum
 what the devils that drum for ali
inquired the doctor irritably as he gazed at
the fire pondering
  it is designed to prepare the mind and
the body for the marriage-feast upon the
full moon doctor
  why thats about tomorrow or the next
day isnt it observed the doctor glancing
up at the battered moon
  two nights more yet
ill
in the steamy heat of the morn-
ing the first conscious impression
of the doctor was that a pulse was
beating in his brain the mental effort of
an automatic medical diagnosis awoke him
to the reality of the merciless beat of the
drum he swore violently and shouted for
coffee outside the net the flies had al-
ready taken over the duty of torment from
the mosquitoes the doctor breakfasted
on river-fish in an exceedingly bad temper
  the inconvenience of the camp-site began
to weaken his resolution to stay even the
few days in the jungle one had not to
scratch all day as well as all night he
consulted ali but as ever merely elicited
the imperturbable allah only knows
the doctor gulped the quinine he was in the
act of swallowing the brilliant black eyes
of ali in his bronze cameo features regarded
him coldly
  if the doctor would permit himself to
meditate upon the occidental and the
or-
meditate spluttered the doctor covet-
ing the irrefragable composure of the arab
l-it i believe ive a touch of malaria
tell yamagulu to get me the thermometer
  but his temperature was normal and his
pulse as steady as the drum-throb later
in the morning he persisted in visiting the
old chief basayaguru in spite of airs as-
surance that no more information would be
forthcoming but at any rate an audience
would serve to fill up time the old man in
token of his greatness and beauty was so fat
that he could scarcely walk he lay like a
baby hippopotamus upon his skins in the
perpetual shadows of his square hut and ap-
peared to do nothing save eat drink snuff
and sleep leaving affairs of war and peace
to his son and politics perforce to yamala
the witch-doctor
to each of the questions put by ali on
the white mans behalf he merely grunted
adventure
non-committally a process which led one to
suppose that he was innocent of every crime
as well as virtue that the black mind could
conceive the only articulate sentence elic-
ited was an order to a slave to send the
white chief another present of a large tusk
of ivory the doctor regarded the tusk in
dismay
  whats the meaning of this he de-
manded of ali we cant possibly make
return presents of anywhere near the value
of these three tusks and the small ones
what do you think hes after my ex-
press because he wont get that natu-
rally
  allah only knows
  oh the doctor plucked savagely at
his beard ali i ask what you think
not what allah thinks
  it is impossible to state doctor never
have i witnessed such exquisite generosity
from a native negro
  the little doctor returned to the camp
feeling as he remarked to ali that there
was something in this confounded country
that would make a saint irritable and as he
retired beneath the mosquito-net for a
siesta he grinned at the recollection of the
sage advice based on theoretical knowledge
he had given to clients about to leave for
the tropics to guard against irritation and
liquor during the hottest hours when man
and beast and bird but not woman made
obeisance to the sun the heart-throb of the
drum continued mercilessly until the doctor
in his sudorific bath struggled with an im-
pulse to seize his express and make an end
of the tormentor
  at about four he suddenly grabbed the
gun and summoning yamagulu decided
that he would seek something upon which
he could wreak his exasperation yama-
gulu very naturally protested that neither
bird nor beast would be stirring before the
cool of the sinking sun but the little doctor
felt that in such a country to thrust forward
reason was positively indecent and as in-
congruous as a socratian debate in a lunatic
asylum
  in the village not a body stirred unno-
ticed they selected the small canoe and em-
barked the doctor directed the sullen
yamagulu to paddle down-stream along
the bank until they should find fairly solid
ground to land about half a mile away as
they coasted just outside the guardian
swamp he perceived a narrow passage in
the dense reed as if made by canoes up
this turgid waterway the doctor insisted
upon going fifty yards paddling and reed
hauling brought them within the line of the
great trees and upon fairly solid earth be-
neath the dense jungle
  the doctor and the sullen yamagulu
landed and tore their way for some dis-
tance earning a bath of sweat in the proc-
ess but this did not deter the doctor who
had obstinately made up his mind that he
wanted distraction from the deadly ennui
of the village farther on they struck
higher ground and came upod a grove of
considerable size
  suddenly the sulky yamagulu came to
life and touching the doctors arm pointed
with his spear down the grove the doctor
failed to distinguish anything in the tangle
of grass and bush then just as he was
about to whisper he detected part of a bush
that seemed to move slowly grew the
form of some large animal calculating for
the region of the heart the doctor fired a
convulsive motion of the bush and there
leaped forth a big buck high in the shoul-
ders and dappled like forest light and
shadow
  again the doctor fired the beast swerved
to the right and disappeared yamagulu
raced forward the doctor followed and
found him beside the buck the first shot
had been a fluke striking the animal in the
quarters as it had turned to flee the bullet
had lodged in the spine killing it instantly
  okapi gasped the exultant doctor
  but as he stoojied yamagulu grinning
delightedly drew his attention to a broad
spoor through the dense grass which ten
yards from the kill was streaked with blood
revealing that in all probability the mate
was severely if not mortally wounded ex-
citedly the doctor bade yamagulu to stay
and skin the slain animal and hurried off on
the trail
  the beast was big and evidently bleeding
heavily so the spoor was easy to follow even
for a white man on panted the doctor
forgetful as ever a hunter is that time after
all is an arbitrary affair the ground rose
steadily the going became better at every
yard where the trail led through thick
bush the beast had already forced a pas-
sage as the ground sank into a slight val-
ley he caught a glimpse of the okapi as it
dashed off from a shelter where it had ap-
parently rested for a moment
the tree of life
  wiping raining sweat from his eyes the
enthusiastic doctor plugged on down into a
bog to his waist dragged himself up the
other side and on-and on-and on the
littje man struggled until quite suddenly
the trail disappeared in a patch of jungle as
thick as a grass mat the doctor hunted
furiously about-then with more care no
sign of blood the blood-trail had disap-
peared entirely not even a broken grass
stem or twig could he find perhaps he
had overrun the trail
  he cast about in circles fatigued and
panting he sat down to rest and wipe his
streaming face just as he was about to
make another effort it suddenly occurred to
him that the shadows seemed very dense
he glanced up through the leafy roof the
glittering ball of the sun was topping the
trees in a panic he snatched his watch
he stared incredulously at the nands point-
ing to a quarter past five only another
three-quarters of an hour to sunset
  - he muttered disappointedly
ill have to give him up now ill go back
and help yamagulu finish the skinning
  a rational and wise decision of the doc-
tors he stepped forward briskly hesi-
tated made a pace and stopped altogether
he glanced about in a bewildered childlike
fashion at the wall of tree trunks festooned
with creepers
  when the devil-what the-oh
  again he stared around more incredu-
lously then very softly he said-
  oh god
he had no more idea of the direc-
tion from which he had come than
of the secret of the cult he was
fatigued so he sat down again sagely
concluding that he might as well rest while
he thought the matter out systematically
yes systematically that was the thing to
do now where was the sun when they had
killed the buck um ah at first he
was sure that it had been over his right
shoulder then as equally positive that it
had been behind him finally he con-
cluded that there hadnt been any-sun
at all
  for a few moments the doctor was occu-
pied in informing himself exactly how many
different kinds of a fool he was he be-
thought himself of yamagulu and proceeded
to inform the african continent what par-
ticular species of criminal idiots it pro-

duced then he plucked at his beard and
glanced at his watch again remained
about forty minutes of daylight-that is
forest semi-gloom tropical twilight was
the only thing in africa in a hurry decided
the doctor bitterly then he rose deter-
minedly and choosing a direction at ran-
dom made the amusing assertion that he
would continue in a straight line
  within twenty yards he was bogged he
tried another direction and found impene-
trable thicket a third attempt found an-
other bog a puzzled wonder as to how the
deuce he had ever arrived where he was
if the confounded jungle was nothing but
swamp-holes was broken by a brilliant idea
of course he would just fire a few shots
which would bring the fool yamagulu to
him accordingly at intervals of half a
minute he proceeded to carry out the
scheme which however was arrested by the
appalling discovery that he only had left
another ten cartridges-with the probability
of spending the night in the jungle
   for a while he stood still trying to con-
centrate upon listening for the expected yell
from the succoring yamagulu in a few
moments he became aware of the voice of
the forest a continued twittering hum
murmurs like lachrymose sighs tiny squeaks
and whispers mysterious rustles a sudden
chatter and a harsh squawk then a faint
hooting he fired another two cartridges
in rapid succession the echoes appeared
like derisive laughter a sudden screech
behind him made him start convulsively
  - he muttered as if afraid to speak
too loud lest some one hear i need a dose
of bromide
  the gloom appeared to be deepening with
a hissing noise as if it were slithering through
the leaves erupted unbidden into his
mind an exact knowledge of african car-
nivora he glanced questioninglv toward a
tree images of gorillas and snakes shut-
tered his eyes swiftly he grew violently
angry with himself at the discovery that he
was searching for things in the darkness
suddenly he cursed aloud as if challenging
the whole menagerie of animals and started
off swiftly straight ahead of him
  fighting with an impulse to run strug-
gling to suppress imagination the doctor
plowed on tearing far more desperately
than he realized through thickets of creep-
ers tacking beside swamp-holes firmly he
persisted in telling himself his exact medical

adventure
condition the forest appeared to over-
hear his thoughts and to laugh in rustling
weeping insidious chuckles against his
will he pulled out his watch repeatedly to
peer at it in the gloom then he tore on to
stop a moment to listen for yamagulus cry
only to hear the forest tuning up for the
nocturnal anthem
  the gloom was so dense now that he
could not see ahead of him the canopied
roof seemed writhing with innumerable
arms groping down-down he crashed
hastily through a tangle of creepers which
seemed to be trying to strangle him
splashed in water and saw the gleam of
moonlight on water he stopped drown-
ing mosquitoes in his own sweat wondered
where he was hoped that it was the creek
and shouted-
  yama-gu-o-o-o-o-o
  oo-oo-oo-o answered him
  a violent squawk brought him face
about with his rille to his shoulder the
forest murmured and sighed mosquitoes
buzzed in clouds
  yie-e squealed a bird at him
  muttering something about a tree he
blundered on along the swamp edge fell
over something and grabbed his hand
clutched the edge of a small canoe drawn
up on the swamp grass at first hope
made him think that it was his canoe and
that yamagulu was in the forest looking
for him he gave a mighty yell that
sobbing echo closed his mouth a short
investigation showed him that the canoe
was smaller than his own he glanced
across the glimmer of water at the dense
wall of the opposite jungle then sud-
denly like a caress he became aware of the
regular pulse of a distant drum
  desire carried the conviction that he had
landed on the farther side of the creek from
the village and that therefore by crossing
he could make the camp by following the
drum he placed the rifle in pushed the
canoe hurriedly over the swamp up to his
knees and clambered aboard pulling the
canoe along the swamp-grass he made deep
water and began to paddle with his hands
a dark object near the other side which he
thought was a floating log suddenly
splashed and disappeared
  crocodiles he gasped and paddled
furiously
  he landed without mishap dragged the
canoe up as far as possible and stopped to
listen for the drum he could hear noth-
ing save the weep of the jungle the cur-
tain of the trees cut off the vibrations he
hesitated a moment before plunging into the
dense shadows the ground became firmer
it began to rise on and on he struggled
scarcely conscious of the mosquitoes again
he saw the moon and a few paces farther on
stood on to the edge of a great glade a
glow caught his eager eyes he hastened
toward it in the moonlight was the faint
outline of a hut
  thank god he muttered the vil-
lage
  as he hurried on he perceived a great
fence around the hut in which was the glow
of a fire at the base of an enormous tree
the doctor reached the fence and peered
through he put up his hand and wiped
his eyes
  my god he murmured am i crazy
  seated beneath the great tree in a camp-
chair in the moonlight was a bearded white
man in full evening dress an opera hat was
tilted on liis head the firelight glowed upon
the expanse of shirtfront
rv
hallucination muttered
the doctor and pawed at his damp
faceagain but the image remained
the head wras sunk forward slightly the
brown beard straggled over the shirtfront
one black-sleeved arm hung listlessly out-
side the chair the other upon the right
knee in the moonlight the eyes glinted
blue as the man stared at the fire
  but a white man in evening kit whis-
pered the doctor incredulously here
good god no no he added after par-
ing at the outline of a square hut built be-
neath the enormous boughs of the giant
tree it is im not crazy the fellers
crazy evening kit-good god what
the-he must be crazy poor devil
  the impulse to call out was inhibited
he began to form excuses to himself
  i mustnt call out suddenly he reflected
or maybe i shall scare the fife out of him
i must humor the poor devil yes yes
of course-unbalanced they do go that
way out here queer understand it too
begad been in the forest all night per-
haps poor devil he added quite as uncon-
scious of the ludicrous as of the fact jhat he
was in reality talking about himself
the tree of life

  he opened his mouth and drew in his
breath yet he did not call out he
wriggled his shoulders as if trying to shake
off an incubus then he realized that he
was fearful that if he shouted the vision
would disappear and he would know that he
was crazy he peered silently for a few
moments blinking his eyes
 no he decided it is real -
queer that bloody forest upset my
nerves um um better find the gate
and let him see me when i shout mustnt
scare the poor devil
  he began to move cautiously along the
palisade six feet high made of stout sap-
lings swallowing and muttering excuses to
account to himself for not shouting stop-
ping occasionally to peep through the in-
terstices he followed the circle until he came
to the great trunk of the tree fully fifteen
feet in diameter he paused again for an-
other look that the vision was still there
he noted with a feeling of reassurance as
he walked around the trunk he was vaguely
conscious that it faced an open expanse of
the great grove a cavern of basalt floored
with jade and topped with fantastic pinna-
cles of chrysoprase
  on the other side he came upon the gate
barred with great heavy balks of timber
the man sat exactly in the same position
had not moved a finger apparently a
wild thought that he was dead flitted across
the doctors mind he began to draw
breath to shout but stopped in indecision
what should he say hi hullo per-
haps the man was not english probably
not what then the question grew into
absurd importance still the doctor stared
through the balk gate the rustle of some-
thing in the grass behind him evoked an un-
easy movement and a clutching at the rifle
destroyed the fascination in the ludicrous
argument as to exactly what he should say
  i say hullo
  the man did not stir then the doctor
was aware that he had whispered he
gripped his rifle lightly and with effort
shouted-
  hull-o
  o-o repeated the grove
  the doctor glared anxiously dreading
that the figure would disappear but the
head rose slowly the eyes moved again
the head sank despondently
  lhank god he is there muttered the
doctor but he thinks im an owl
  i say-er-hullo
  once more the beard rose slowly
  i say im here continued the doctor
fatuously he could see the eyes staring
as if mildly inquiring in the moonlight i
say old chap are you english its all
right er-would you mind letting me in
he perceived the beard to part suddenly
disclosing white teeth the man was
smiling
  good god murmured the doctor
he is crazy poor feller
  i say he began again enunciating care-
fully ive lost-my-way yknow would
you mind-letting me in im herd-
wether-borden millar herd wether oh
- hi im an english doctor mag-
dalen and london i say arent you en-
glish parez-vous franqais  eh
  still smiling distinctly in the moonlight
the man raised a white hand and slowly
waved it toward the doctor
  my god ejaculated the doctor shud-
dering involuntarily am i crazy or are
you
  he stared the eyes resumed the de-
spondent contemplation of the fire
  what on earth am i to do he thinks
im not here and i thought he wasnt he
pawed at his damp hair if i throw any-
thing to attract his attention hell think im
a lion or some wild animal and im not
the little doctor was unconscious of the
whimper in his voice i cant stop out
here all uight -it and who is he any-
way but whats he want to dress for
he complained bitterly and glanced behind
him at the cavern of the grove
  the doctor became aware of an illusion
that he was within a barred cage like a cap-
tive monkey and that the man inside the
fence was free there must be wild ani-
mals or else he wouldnt have this con-
founded fence um
  the strange man rose to his feet yawned
and stretched his arms
  o god hes going to bed muttered the
doctor resentfully it cant be more than
nine oclock then desperately as the tall
black back revealed the swallow tails he
shouted hii for gods sake let me in
the tall figure turned sharply in his direc-
tion
  yes bawled the doctor its all
right im here i tell you herdwetlier
the man was staring in his direction
yes yes come and let me in and ill
i
adventure
explain the beard waggled slowly as if in
regretful dissent i am here yelled lhe
doctor frantically englishman doctor
im lost help
  the man took two paces stopped and
spoke incomprehensible words
  no no screamed the doctor speak
english p cadet franqaisl
  he could sec the beard move as if the
man were talking to himself suddenly
the fellow stooed picked up a glowing fire-
brand and slowly walked toward the gate
   god he thinks im a gorilla muttered
the doctor and involuntarily brought up his
ritie
   for gods sake speak man he yelled
im real  tell you im a white man
the bearded man in full evening dress with
a firebrand in his hand stopped abruptly
and stared toward the fence
  a white man he exclaimed where
oh my god where
  here here im lost let me in im
lost
  the man hesitated moved as if to throw
away the brand arrested his arm and
stooped again to peer at the fence
  who and what are you he demanded
are you real-or am i crazy speak
no no im real shouted the doctor
im english i tell you
       the man appeared satisfied for
he threw away the firebrand and
advanced with long eager strides 
toward the gate wrenched up the balks of
timber and then as if suddenly suspicious
leaped backward clear of the entrance
the doctor walked through took off his hel-
met and held out his hand
how dyou do sir im herdwether
the big man gazed down at him and
placed a hand to his forehead perplexedly
  i suppose its all right he mumbled
-if i know er-how dvou do he
touched the extended hand perfunctorily
i-er-dont quite understand-yet you
said-are you a white man
  yes yes said the doctor soothingly
wliite i assure you english doctor
yknow i-er-lost my way and-and
saw your fire so i just came along
  oh
   the eyes were still regarding him rather
like a great child uncertain as to w-hether
the visitor was a tramp or an angel
  my names herdwether-borden millar
herdwether im here on a commission
yknow forgive me i havent the pleas
ure-
  eh oh
   gazing incredulously the man shook his
leard as if trying to throw off an illusion
sorry er-im bukely-warren-dukelv
yknow
   what warren-dukely the explorer
exclaimed the doctor in astonishment
   the man giggled throwing ijack his head
  i beg your pardon he added more
rationally
   not at all said the doctor not at
all er-i wonder if youd mind if we sit
down i-er-im rather fagged out
  fagged out what the words ap-
peared to act as a restorative i say
im awfully sorry of course come
along he started off toward the fire
stopped abruptly and murmuring for-
gotten the door old boy hurried back and
readjusted the balks
  the doctor waited for him trying to
catch a glimpse of the face the man re-
turned with great eager strides and to the
doctors amazement caught him by the
shoulders and spun him around face to the
moon
  good god almighty he exclaimed
thats good he dropped him as sud-
denly i say i beg your pardon you
must forgive me i-er-im a little off my
chump yknow i-well as a matter of
fact i havent seen a white man for years
 dont know i-but come and sit down
he strode forward to the hut his swallow
tails flirting in the moonlight and emerged
dragging another camp-chair sit down
old man by the way i didnt quite
catch herwether
   herdwether said the doctor sitting
and he almost giggled as he saw the man
pick up his tails as he sat as if he were in a
club
   dukely still stared a little incredulously
the doctor observed in the fire-glow the
gauntness of the cheek-bones and the sunken
eyes embarrassed he looked at the fire
thinking-
   he cant be quite crazy if he knows it
but what on earth is he dressed for
   conscious of the eyes devouring him he
sat still considerately waiting for his host to
speak
my god its good to see you exclaimed
dukely at length i-dyou know i heard
the tree of life
your voice calling but-but - it i
thought i was dreaming
  i understand said the doctor quietly
one gets rather ratty after a while
begin to see things if youre not careful
er-v you camping near here
  yes assented the doctor down at
basa-somethings village wherever that is
i was out shooting yknow and got lost
oh yes
  as he stole a glance at the man a black
sleeve crept out and a hand lightly touched
his arm involuntarily the doctor started
yet he had noticed that the hand was well
kept the nails polished
  there was silence for some minutes the
forest murmured and whispered and wept
yet the sinister note was missing to the doc-
tors ears twice he glanced up at the
bearded gaunt face the man continued
to stare almost like a yokel gawping at
a circus fat lady the doctor was embar-
rassed a thousand questions leaped to his
mind
  er he broke out at length - i wonder
whether you have such a thing as a glass of
water im simply parched
  dukely leaped from his chair as if gal-
vanized
  certainly certainly he muttered im
an awful rotter and he disappeared into
the hut to emerge writh a calabash of water
  oh thanks very much the doctor
hesitated glanced at the hut and up at the
tall man in evening dress he fumbled at
his hip pocket um i-you dont mind
if i-do you care for whisky
  whisky echoed dukely the eyes
brightened at the glint of a silver flask and
were masked politely good god i
havent tasted whisky for-oh thanks
  he almost grabbed swallowed at a gulp
the tot of spirit which the doctor had prof-
erred in the screw-cap then he gasped shak-
ing his head at lhe calabash the doctor took
his share and a deep drink of water as he
placed the calabash on the ground beside
him the man sat down slowly and fell to
gazing at his visitor again without speaking
  good god thought the doctor is he
going to stare at me all night
  er by the way said he desperately
have you-are you staying here long
  the man started and seemed to shiver
he said slowly-
  well im going to be married in a day or
so
  oh yes ah of course assented the doc-
tor politely
im the king of the wood yknow
oh yes yes ejaculated the doctor as he
thought my god hes as mad as a hatter
v
      the man with the beard laughed
      a rusty throaty sound and stroked
      his nose delicately
  i beg your pardon said he im a
little ratty i mean ive been so long-er-
here that-i forget that everybody doesnt
know-well who i am and that sort of
thing
  quite so quite so very usual phe-
nomenon
  of course continued the explorer
gaining more rationality in the tone of his
speech and leaning forward in his chair
you probably think im as mad as a
hatter the doctor looked away not
quite-yet he stared at the fire medi-
tatively by the way what did you say
you were here for sir
  im on a commission economic and
social investigation yknow
  social eh thats good again he
emitted a throaty chuckle were fright-
fully keen on sociolog here oh- yesl
er-but didnt you say you were a medical
man
  yes
  hm perhaps youll understand a
little better although i dont see why
you should i mean you wont be so
inclined to think im quite insane
  not at all not at all
  but you do oh yes quite natural
i should myself by the way youre not
in a hurry are you
  oh no not at all
  the teeth gleamed through the beard
in a smile at the fire dukely shifted rest-
lessly and looked up again
  that whisky of yours doctor has
bucked me up a lot-pulled me together
i ran out six months ago you know im
not insane
  no no assented the doctor still won-
dering but have another
  thanks old man
  the skinny white hand again just re-
frained from grabbing the screw-cap
  by the lord thats good he gasped
as he handed back the flask queer

adventure
how the bally stuff stings after so long
er hm
  have a cigar added the doctor
good lord heartiness was creeping
in to the voice thats awfully good of
you no dont bother for a match
  he bent forward picked a firebrand with
delicate fingers and sighed at the first
puff he sat back seemingly absorbed
in the joy of the inhalation the doctor
began to note details that the shirt was
soft and yellow frayed the parched skin
drawn tightly over an acquiline nose and
the care bestowed on the liands even the
beard had been trimmed
  yes began warren-d ukely reflec-
tively im the king of the wood
again the doctor was conscious of the
thrill imparted by insanity no im
not insane doc i-am exactly what
i say let me see confound it there is
something the matter with my mind
difficult of-er-grasping what i want
to say you ought to understand that
eh

i never realized il until now never
realized that i was so far gone hm

  yes yes of course
  well i was-or am i suppose-am
warren-d ukely-i told you that didnt i
yes all right now im the king of
the wood - it do you hear that
drum
  the doctor listened and was aware of
the faintest possible vibration
  yes its the drum in the village
isnt it
  oh yes the drum all right only-
he sighed and suddenly placed one hand
over his eyes as if shutting out a vision
i beg your pardon ill try to get on-
and tell vou what a mess youre in
  i am
  oh ill tell you er-about three
years ago-or was it four wrhats the
date old man

at the little doctor thats good-all
right ill go on by the way did you
say you were jesus
  no magdalen
  warren-p ukely smiled at the fire and
puffed at his cigar seeming tohaveforgotlen
his guest the pulse of the drum was
so faint lliat it appeared like the strokes
of an invisible baton conducting the noc-
turnal anthem a cricket shrilled piercingly
nd ceased a distant prolonged yowl
was just audible the doctor was watch-
ing warren-dukely with professionally
keen eyes he observed certain spasmodic
twitches of the bare toes and a persistent
scratching at the chair arm with one
polished finger-nail
   guess i must have been before your
time anyway he said conversationally
  eh the start was convulsive he
stared at the doctor then the eyes smiled
oh i beg your pardon one gets to
dreaming-more or less er-what the
mischief was i gassing about
  you were going to tell me how you
became king of the wood
  king of the wood did i say that-
really this cigar seems awful strong by
the way still years since i smoked one
suddenly he sprang to his feet and
bending over -the doctors chair touched
his bare hand as he picked up the calabash
he stood with the water in his hand and
smiled down at the visitor in a relieved
manner
  i wonder whether you could spare he
insinuated
   i dont think you had better observed
the doctor quietly a little later perhaps
youre not accustomed to it yknow
quite right quite right and youll
need it yourself id forgotten that
  ill need it oh you mean-it isnt
that ive a good supply with me
   so had i old boy so had i muttered
warren-dukely as he turned away with
the calabash of water in his hand by the
chair he stopped glanced at it and threw
the tree of life
it away irritably - it i continually
do that carry things about still what
does it matter
  sticking the cigar in his mouth he be-
gan to pace up and down before the fire
staring at the ground the doctor did
not disturb him presently he began with
a jerk
ive got it by jove i know i
began yarning about that first
expedition didnt i well after
that africa seemed to get in my blood
i broke off the engagement with sybil
had to only decent thing to do cant
expect a woman to wait-like a sergeants
wife an one cant drag her around
here eh sides im not a marrying
man never was poor old sybby i
wonder whether shes still running the
cheshire
  oh well on the second trip i had a
mania to come through tchad pick np
boyd alexanders trail-poor old boy-
and zigzag down through the albert lakes
and land eventually in rhodesia i circled
tchad and went off to the dinka country
told you all that though didnt i well
never mind i tacked back here an barged
into old basayaguru as you -did eh an
the -- old cutthroat made me king of
the wood
  he stopped to raise his head and emit
that throaty chuckle the doctor watch-
ing him keenly began to revise his opinion
of his sanity he wheeled round one hand
stuck under the tails of his coat and the
other holding the cigar
  bally idiot aint i he demanded
you wait ol boy your innings next for
king of the wood he barked rather
than laughed this time
  still ive played the game - your
eyes he appeared to be addressing
somebody unseen but he said no i
mean you doc he began to pace again
moodily sorry ol chap he said as
abruptly youll understand as soon
as i can spit it out i say the old boys
very generous with his ivory an stuff
isnt he
  yes
 hm thought so invited you to
witness the marriage of the sacred tree
didnt he
  y-yes admitted the little doctor
wondering why he felt uneasy
 same hellish trick still it would have
 been the same anyway how many men
 have you doc
 twenty-five three canoes
 all armed
 well-sniders enough for all of em
 but-
 oh pish he waved an impatient hand
 wrhat bally rot im talking isnt a
 dogs chance my dear old boy i had
 fifty-all armed with martinis
 im afraid i dont understand
 good god of course you dont i say
 know anything about folklore
 a little
 talked about the sacred tree didnt
 they
 yes
 well thats the bloody thing there
 he raised a hand to the giant tree above
 him mother of all an has to have a
 husband every year
 so i understand my head man ali
 mohammed told me that they have
 muddled some ancient arab philosophy
 with their own superstitions very inter-
 esting ceremony i should imagine
 interestin ceremony -
 agitatedly the tall man began to pace
 up and down before the fire again sucking
 fiercely at the stump of the cigar
 im to be the - things husband
 he jerked out
 indeed said the doctor interestedly
 for he knew of many ceremonies prevalent
 in europe as elsewhere of the symbolical
 marriage of a girl to a tree then sud-
 denly oh you mean that theyve kept
 you here a prisoner for this ceremony of
 theirs but thats nonsense i mean of
 course ill help you to-
 warren-dukely wheeled upon him
 swiftly and pointing his cigar at him
 cried
 but you - fool ive told you
 youre trapped for the next husband
 husband repeated the little doctor
 bewilderedly
 yes yes
 but what-what happens to you
 me im sacrificed to this confounded
 ju-ju are you blind the night of the
 marriage orgy they carve me up wipe out
 your camp and stick you here to make
 magic for twelve moons
 my god ejaculated the little doctor
 half rising to his feet
iyo
adventure
          vi
warren-dukely hurled his
cigar stump into the fire turned on
his heel and flung his body into his
chair the doctor remained for a moment
staring incredulously then as if he had
grasped the import of the mans words
and had decided that they were sane he
stood up abruptly and came over to
warren-dukely
  this-this seems incredible ifi the
twentieth century i-
  the polished nails gleamed in the fire-
light as the delicate hand patted the
doctors arm half-caressingly half-reas-
suringly
  it isnt my dear old boy this isnt
its before the flood sit down doc i feel
better now ive got that off my chest
for twelve moons ive been dying to tell
a white man that my god
  but-is it true demanded the doctor
conscious of the fingers spasmodically
clutching his arm
  its true all right true as death
the eyes gleamed as the beard emitted the
throaty chuckle sit down old boy
doctor herdwether returned to his chair
confusedly unable yet to decide whether
or no the story was the result of a dis-
ordered brain warren-dukely dragged
over his chair close beside the doctors
and leaned forward
  my brains all right now doc er-
forgive me but i cant resist touching you-
to see if youre there yknow by the way
thats why i dress sometimes just to try
to keep myself sane helps cant fool
around all day an night doin nothin
i mean even cleanin oneself an pretendin
things keeps-oh reminds one of what
one was otherwise-well it isnt done
is it not playing the game
  but if-what you inferred-we might
escape-ought not to lose any time
time you dear old thing ive been
sitting here for twelve moons wastin time

round
  but ive got a canoe exclaimed the
doctor i came in it
  really an what the blazes s the
good of that i tried old boy you bet
your life i did i hadnt got a canoe but
i got across on a log in spite of the bloody
crocs i wished i hadnt they got me
 three days-or centuries-later i dunno
 want to live in the jungle eh
   god said the doctor and shuddered
 but we could make my camp an-
   your camp in the village isnt it
 sides did you blaze your trail here eh
 which direction did you come from
 the little doctor made an inarticulate noise
 as he glanced over liis shoulder no it
 wasnt that way thats where the village
 is and i say for how long dyou think
 we two an your twenty-five rats could
 put up a scrap against the mob my dear
 old boy we havent got a dogs chance
 ive known it for twelve moons come
 buck up an well have a chat before we
 go-or rather i go but im not goin
 that way by god playing the game or
 not v
   what do you mean
   one long arm shot up like a salute to
 the great bough above them
   youll see in daylight has a pod
 thing poison
  but-but- exclaimed the doctor
 jumping to his feet	
  but but mocked warren-dukelv
 harshly what the devils the use of
 butting were not goats sides ive
 butted for twelve bloody moons come
 old boy lets have a drink an-an well
 toddle along to stones an finish up at the
 empire - sit down man
   suddenly he sprang to his height and
 slapped the doctor on the shoulder so that
 he sat down hurriedly then tilting the
 opera hat upon the side of his head like a
 comedian he lifted up his beard toward the
 moon and trolled in a husky tenor
  come landlord fill the flowing bowl until it doth
    run over-ove-er
  for tonight well mem- merry be
  for tonieht well merry merry be
  for tonight well merry mcrr-y b-e-e-
  tomorrow well be so-ber
   at the last word he snatched off his hat
 and stood bareheaded in the moonlight as
 the forest answered coldly-
  o-be-r
   listen he cried gesturing largely
 theres my faithful pal never goes back
 always kgrees with me the only english
 voice ive heard for fourteen moons come
 on old boy lets have a drink god
 knows im dry enough - he ex-
 claimed crushing the hat beneath his arm
the tree of life
 and bowing satirically to the doctor for
 gods sake buck up im neither drunk
 nor crazy but lord youre the first
 entertainment ive had for twelve moons
 fourteen moons moon moons moons
nothing but moons wilde knew-little
about moons to what i know ive
watched ive studied ive wooed-every
bloody one of the fourteen moons
  sit down said the doctor sharply
  eh
  the tall figure wheeled toward him
  sit down and well have a drink but
dont get excited
  excited you dear old duck i havent
had such a time since ma died
  the hat went careering wildly through
the moonlight turned a somersault and
settled drunkenly on one rim warren-
dukely dragged his chair a foot lumped
into it and caught his hand to his eyes
  sorry old man ill be good fire
ahead with that drink though then in
a dreary voice as the doctor pulled out the
flask you know you havent an idea as
to what this means to me one gets used
to anything in life but-well i did want
to speak to a white man once more tribal
of course but- he dropped his hand
to watch at the gurgle of liquid you
know doc old pal im so - glad to
see you i feel like a bally woman wel-
comin her lover an all that sort of thin
im glad but i guess you aint
  here drink this and youll feel better
said the doctor proffering the screw-cap
  thanks warren-dukely gulped the
liquor at a draft lord how it bites
now you have a drink an ill try to tell
you what sort of a picnic youre in for
oh thanks a million times
  he accepted the cigar lighted it with a
brand leaned back and puffed reflectively
the distant anthem pulsed steadily a
night-bird squawked persistently the
faint vibration of the drum just reached
them after lighting his cigar the doctor
said quietly
  you know dukely i cant quite realize
this i-
  of course you cant its taken me
twelve moons to realize it oh-those
moons
  no i mean there must be some way-
out of it we cant be murdered by these
savages
  i object i admit the throaty chuckle
wtas repeated now let me tell you an
then youll understand ill guarantee
er hm my minds foggin again oh
yes i know-
  he stared up at the sinister boughs of
the giant tree the eyes hardened
  the nervous twitching of the fingers
began again
  yes i think i can do it you need
it anyhow-to understand he leaned
forward kicked the embers of the fire into
a blaze and plunged abruptly
  i told you how they caught me eh
with the same trick of apparent friendliness
invited me to the show yknow very
well two days before that drum there
began sound physiological idea works
em up all right on the openin night
i was led here an given an orchestra stall
while the orchestra was tunin up same
moon same tree whole crowd of em
here mumblin an chantin just beyond
there in the open space old chief on his
bally throne tiling an the young un
master of ceremonies-your pal- yes
ill bet hes been your special friend eh
with his head-dress-looked like a lord
mayors hat
  well whole bunch of young girls an
my illustrious predecessor the king of the
wood he sat beneath the tree there
just outside the gate of course i didnt
twig the game-then dyou see em in
the moonlight then that - drum-
ming-all the time-persistent-seemed to
get in your bally head yknow or your
veins-heart i felt excited myself seen
various sort of dances before an all that
but-somehow this was different real
thing i suppose
  sort of tiling they never do for white
men except when theyre-theyre to be
the piece de resistance yknow but i
didnt they had told me somethin about
the principle of the thing the marriage
of the husband person-a great big devil
by the way more negro than these people
came from the kameroons i believe
prisoner of war they have an amusing
idea that the bigger the man the more
the lady-i mean the tree-is pleased more
power i suppose of course white man an
white magic an all that
  well they kept up this - drum-
ming an wnigglin about-usual witch-
doctor business-for the devil of a time
drinkin all the time native beer yknow

adventure
fermented corn then the girls stomach-
dances an all that meanwhile the big
feller sat up there in the shadow of the
tree sulky silent god knows whether
he knew what was coming i began to get
bored again that throaty chuckle with
a harsh rasp to it god-see the same
old thing all over again then just as the
moon spilled over that big bough there
and covered the big negro there came a
change that must have been the mystic
sign i suppose
  well your pal yamala prancing about
suddenly ceased his croonin row and
darted at the fellow together with a crowd
of other black devils i heard the scream
i didnt realize what they had him
stripped over there in the moonlight-an
a knife-old yamala the beard jerked
as if he were biting his lips
  god-ive seen things of course youre
a doctor an used to carvin-but god it
would have made you sick again he
moved restlessly in his chair they cut
him alive-screeches-poor devil-then
they-they put it up there he actually
pointed to the exact spot up there in the
fork of that bough see i vomited
  the hum of the insectile anthem con-
tinued remorselessly to the beat of the
invisible baton a cricket sang a shrill
solo and ceased far away was the effect
of sorrow in a hyena only one cigar
glowed like the fierce eye of a dragon
from the doctor came an inaruculate noise
vii
      warren-dukely stooped for a
      brand to relight his cigar he
      puffed thirstily
  twelve moons ago the cycle eh still
well then i wanted to go my head man
was with me-poor devil they were too
busy to notice me then-i went off and
down to the canoes but there werent any
canoes-at least not where we had landed
they must have hidden them somewhere
else on the island of course i didnt know
then that it was an island well i was in a
-of a rage i came blunderin back here
blood-drunk an crazy orgy of course
  just over there cookin parts of the
body on great fires blood an hair and wo-
men all over the place saturnalia i might
as well have expected a rational answer
from a lunatic asylum my boy was gone
i wish to god id shot em i couldnt
have got em all of course but most of em
before they had come to their senses but
i didnt know i cleared off an walked
about all night then-of course  had not
a notion-what-what-well you know
now
  i came back in the dawn the drums
were going some still dancin like stuffed
vultures others gorged slept they
made me sick i went off an sat under a
tree-that one over there i decided to
clear out next day as i couldnt undertake
to wipe out the tribe yet i recollect that
i thought what a toppin account it would
make in a book queer ideas one gets-
when fates playin round oh god
yknow doc ive wondered sometimes-
since-when ive been wooin the moon
there whether we arent all merely charac-
ters-an-rotten ones mostly eh in
a book what but lord id like to get
my hands on my author who put me here-
an you sorry
  he ceased abruptly puffed twice and
shot out-
   well what are you goin to do about it
doc
  i really dont know the little doc-
tors voice had lost the irritable note he
appeared to have regained his consult ing-
room tone-suave impersonal but what
did you do then-in the morning
  i do - an tommy what d you
think i could do they pinched my rifle
while i slept then they trotted me up to
this place oh yes i objected still they
were an ugly crowd an lots of em of
course i didnt know what was up at the
time as a matter of fact they flung me in
here and then skedaddled i roamed
around to find out that the darned place was
an island among other things i found
were about a couple of dozen heads of my
men on the trees down there courteous re-
minder yknow
   they starved me for three days an then i
began to find goats left in the stockade here
while i was away huntin round for some
one to kill after about ten days of that
sort of thing i dunno-they brought one
of my men in a canoe an made him inter-
pret for me of course i got as mad as --
when the feller told me about the husband
business of the magic tree an all that he
said they had all been wiped-except him-
self-and eaten
v
the tree of life

  after that i tried to escape i told you
eh that cured me-or broke me i dun-
no i was delirious when they brought me
back here i pulled through an found all
mv gear here-more or less-except guns
the other things they thought were magic
an were scared to interfere with em even
the whisky thank heaven
  the whisky queried the doctor sharp-
ly didnt they drink that
  no brought up all nearly all my gear
except my rifles didnt know what whisky
was probably-or thought it was magic
stuff
 oh commented the doctor um
um i say how about your medicine-chest
have you got it still
  oh yes quinine all finished
 um how about opium
  finished too you see old boy that
was rather useful sometimes-when the
whisky had run out gives you sleep at
at any rate
  got any aconite
  no
 laudanum
  finished too partly for same reason
also had dysentery yknow why
why because i dont intend to provide
a post-mortem lecture for your witch-
doctor friend
  oh well youll have twelve moons to
think it over
  nonsense
  warren-dukely yawned lazily
  youll find out old boy same as i did
a year of contemplation sobers you up a bit
whats it matter after all i dont care
what they do afterward
  look here dukely get that out of your
mind
  thats all right doc youre fresh an
eager-same as i was then i was mad to
see a white once more an youve given
me that of course im sorry that youll
have to pay such a price for my amusement
but-it old man  didnt lug you here
did i i wish you better luck than ive
had by the way youll find in my effects
various letters an things for my people
an doc if gods kinder to you than he
is to me i want you not to give away
the cheap horrors to-to my own people
and pals an dont let the papers get hold
of the yarn
  im not dancin round in hell to make
a journalists holiday all details of my
trip an notes on customs particularly
the legends an practises among our dear
friends here are together in the canvas-
covered book addressed to the r g s
he glanced at the doctor who was leaning
forward elbows on knees staring fixedly
at embers dont seem interested eh
doc youre right talkin rot aint i
i mean how the blazes re you goin to get
em out yourself i tried-all sorts of
crazy ideas
  put notes in bottles an chucked em
in the swamp island dont touch the
main stream of course they stopped there-
unless old surgeon yamala has found em
an turned em into ju-ju medicine or
somethin well im goin to turn in
get plenty of rest for the show tomorrow
night-or is it today he glanced at the
moon no cant be more than eleven
ha all the theaters cornin out eh poor
old piccadilly recollect that night i was
chucked out of the empire ah well-
i can give you a dose on the floor doc
same as me
sit down snapped the doctor
as he began to rise from his chair
ive got an idea
  sweet infant so had i by the dozen
brilliant ideas every ten minutes i know
shut up and sit down
  all right old man im not pressed
for time fire ahead
  look here as far as i can make out
from wrhat you tell me and wrhat ive seen
we may have a sportin chance
  - sportin
  shut up dukely youre fagged
with twelve months of this an fever an
all that our nerves are in a rotten condi-
tion naturally your constitutions under-
mined which affects your will you see
things-
  see things oh my hat
  i said see things as they are not now
irv to pull yourself together an answer my
questions
  certainly old boy fire ahead
  sit up in your chair with your head
forward and your back stiff dukely
commanded the doctor get that spine-
less despair out of your mind-just for five
minutes-and ill give you a tonic thatll
buck you up thatsit now what
time exactly do they begin the-the show
eight-thirty early doors seven

adventure
dont be a - fool dukely im
 serious
 sorry old boy thought it was a joke
 well what time before sunset or
 after
 at the rising of the moon but what
 thats got to-
 shut up and listen do they start
 drinking immediately
 you bet they do
 good whats the beer kept in large
 calabashes
 yes 
 where
 all over the place mostly near the
 tree
 when do they bring the beer
 bring the beer why several days
 beforehand has to settle yknow
 is it here now then
 yes dukely gestured behind him
 at the back of my hut there gallons of
 the stuff
 um the little doctor wriggled
 slightly now about this tree what
 is it
 the magic tree tree of life they call
 it
 you said it was poisonous
 yes
 of what species is it
 i dunno seems to be- of the same
 family as the baobab-andansoniaknow
 but yet quite unlike the baobabs of the
 south never seen one like it before
 um citric tribasic muttered the
 doctor no good he stared up at the
 great boughs and jumping to his feet in his
 nervous- manner went across and began
 to pick at the bark of the great bole
 thats not andansonia he commented
 with a leap in his voice as he returned to his
 chair donl know what it is un-
 classified i should say
 no i dont think its baobab wouldnt
 be poisonous if it were
 do they ever use it
 yes on the-husband they say that
 it is the blood of the mother which he must
 eat before he is-married
 ah whats the effect
 oh god doc thats what i want to
 know they-they dont give the poor
 devil a chance to die the stuff of the pod
 is thrust down his throat an then-
 what i described but whats the scheme
 shove it in the beer an poison the swine
my hairy aunt dukely leaped to his feet
with a yell youve got it by god old
man
  wait a minute said the doctor quietly
not so fast
  by god i feel alive once more we
must do it doc thatll fix them
thats the-sit down dukely the
point is will it fix em how do we
know what poison it is what quantity
is required to produce the desired effect
oh the devil oh it must
  desire has no effect on organic matter
my friend um um havent got any
animals around here to experiment on
not a thing they bring me food every
morning fowls and sometimes goats but
always ready killed
 um wish to heaven we knew what
family it is he stared at the great tree
by which lhe moon in midarc was almost
obscured have you got anything to
knock down one of these pods
  no but ive some here said warren-
dukely fumbling in his pocket i-i
thought they might be useful in case any-
thing happened before schedule yknow
the doctor took one split it open and
examined the con ten ls seeds embedded in
a yellowish creamy maller
  um um he mullered sniffing il
wonder what the devil it can be the
odor seems familiar very what the-
-if i know tastes sweetish he added
putting a grain upon his tongue-tip
  for gods sake be careful old man
cried warren-dukely
  the doctor held the pod in one hand and
stared at the moonlit glade
  if only i could think what that reminds
me of i might get a clue ive half a
mind to try have you any mustard for an
emetic
  dont be crazy doc and i havent
any anyway it may be anything mavbe
the stuff some of these devils poison their
arrows with i knowr thats a vegetable
poison of some sort and absolutely deadly
true
  besides if it takes a long time the actual
knowledge wont do us any good i mean
thats our only chance either way
  true again what time do they come
in with food
  sunrise or before
  well well have to take the chance
thats all come we must fix up the stuff
the tree of life

now grind it up i suppose as much as
possible and stick it in their beer thank
heaven its sweetish they probably wont
notice it or rather like the sweet effect
how much have you got there of the stuff
oh only about a handful i thought
that would be enough for me
  put that idea out of your head said
the doctor sharply now come along
ill bunk you up on that bough and you
grab the pods about a quarter of a pound
per gallon ought to be enough if it were
aconite it would knock em stiff at the first
gulp
  into the gloom of the great trees interior
disappeared the coat-tails of warren-dukely
looking like some monstrous wliite-breasted
bird clumsily seeking to roost
vra
as a lover hastens to a tryst so
rose the sun and rising seemed to
dally in the pleasance of liis love
with the hot kiss upon the dew-tipped
crest of the giant tree the two white men
hustled the last of the empty pods into the
latrine behind the hut just as a bird
raucously announced the capture of his
prey to his nearby mate warren-dukely
peering through the fence saw the first
of the six young girls who daily brought his
food for to a layman or woman of the age
of puberty was it worse than death to come
within the orbit of the sacred magicians
sight the husband of the tree of life
arbiter of fecundity in crops and women
mother of all potent and terrible
  across the glade ttiey came lithe young
forms of ebony moving lissomely from their
slender waists bearing upon their immobile
heads a slain goat chickens and calabashes
of sweet water milk and eggs-for must the
holy mate of the goddess be propitiated
and fed sumptuously to avoid his great
displeasure
  better lie perdue doc warned warren-
dukely while i find out whether they
know where you are or not-thats if these
children know
  at the entrance to the palisade the six
stooped and having placed the loads upon
the ground called shrilly the prescribed
greeting dukely replied one responded
in the chanting speech which was obligatory
in addressing a sacred person then in
single file they turned and glided down the
glade as if well content to have completed
their dangerous duties
  as i thought old man reported
dukely returning into the hut with the
groceries they know that youre here
and by way of precaution i instructed em
to tell our invaluable friend yamala that
i had summoned you my brother to take
my place after i had-entered into con-
nubial felicity
  dyou think theyll swallow that
inquired the little doctor squatted upon an
overturned calabash stroking his beard
  oh lord yes you havent learned
as i have the great prestige of a medicine-
man they will expect crops an what not
as never before by the union of such a great
white magician as i god so thoughtful
too i even provide a successor as mighty
why demanded the doctor with a
calabash of milk in his hands dont they
cultivate the glade here near to the source
of magic power seems queer
  oh no they dare not do that the
island is sacred as ive told you they
seem to look upon the ground here as a
part of the body of the great mother and
re scared to hurt her feelings by seratchin
her skin thats the idea as ive under-
stood
  hm homeopathic magic as usual
dukely sank down upon the camp-bed
phew im fagged out sorry old
man he added swiftly im forgettin
my duties you must be starving theres
some cold goat in that calabash beside you
an some combread of a sort-sourdough
yknow wtien youve eaten wed better
have a sleep you must need it by jove-
sos well be fit for the-diamond sculls
tonight he added with a chuckle that
was less harsh oh by the way well
need your gun doc so let me have it
and ill toddle along an hide it in a bough
near where i know now the canoes will be
we can pick it up as we go
  good and you may as well take
these few cartridges in case they should
take a fancy to them eh
  as soon as he had gone with the rifle
and the belt the little doctor whose curi-
osity had been excited by the first glimpse
of the interior of the hut by daylight rose
to note the contents at one end wras the
camp-bed with a bepatched mosquito-net
in the middle lacing the door was a chair
beside a crude bookcase of shelves formed
i
adventure
of sapling logs burned off and strung
together with bark fiber containing about
a dozen volumes of which the most con-
spicuous were a volume of the royal
geographical societys journals a swin-
burne and a rabelais and some chunky
volumes bound in canvas at the far end
was a green canvas table on which set in
orderly array before a shaving-mirror were
a number of small objects which gleamed
in the half-light
  chewing a rib of goat the doctor rose
stealthily for a surreptitious peep at a
complete manicure-set and hair-brushes in
ivory gold inlaid as he handled them
curiously he observed on each one a crest
of what appeared to be a naked scimitar
blade clasped by a mailed hand the little
man took the bone from the nest of his
beard to grin as he remarked
  totemism complete case most in-
teresting bless the dear no wonder they
wanted him for a medicine-man
  the sound of the balks of the gate being
dropped into place sent him scuttling back
guiltily to his seat on the calabash
  do yourself well he observed as
dukely entered
  oh yes but by the lord doc old
man if it hadnt been for my pals there
i couldnt have stood it my god no
the expression in his eyes as they glanced
at the primitive library was almost like
a dog who knew he is about to be parted
from his master he swore quietly and
remarked dyou know doc the hardest
things goin to be to leave my pals there
tonight
  rot said the doctor with the rib of
goat in his beard you can get other
editions but with a glance at the bulky
canvas books it does seem a pity to leave
these note-books they are arent thev
um
  warren-dukely sighed as he stretched
himself on the bed
  queer he observed staring at the
grass roof a while ago i was willing to-
oh cut a deans throat to get out of this
hell an now when i think im good as free
im wanting to raise cain cause i cant take
my worldly goods an chattels with me
  human nature ol boy commented
the doctor chewing away as contentedly
as a terrier at the bone
  oh i beg your pardon ol man sud-
denly cried dukely springing from his bed
look here you make yourself comfortable
here yes yes courtesy goes to the
devil an all here
  umgh uragh grunted the doctor
through his bone sit down an dont be a
fool im all right
  no no dukely dragged one yellow
pillow from the bed and sprawled on the
floor turn in when you feel like it
anyway as soon as youve finished sitting
on my wardrobe ill change theyd
probably put me in gaol at kavaballas
if i arrived in this kit he added with a
slight return of the hysterical note in his
voice
the doctor who appeared to have
lost every trace of his normal irri-
tability did not dispute the point
but having finished another bone and drunk
some more milk rolled on to the bed and
was asleep in five minutes flies buzzed
in freedom walked upon the doctors nose
and danced upon his eyelids with im-
punity they essayed to hold a carnival upon
the long figure in khaki crouched upon the
floor but were repulsed by the bony hand
of perfect nails shadows dwindled toward
the west parrots began to squawk a
wart-hog and his family nosed inquisitively
around the palisade and went a truffling
farther up the glade
  hornets played busily between the forest
and a nest of clay beneath the eaves a
lizard progressed in suspicious darts across
the earthen floor reached the calabash of
goat abandoned by the doctor and feasted
most lizardlv upon the swarming flies
suddenly a streak of cobalt blue struck the
empurpled lizard like dulled lightning
and a small snake startled by a throttled
gurgle slithered into a hollow in the wattle
and daub wall from the southern end
of the glade parrots streamed screeching a
pessimistic warning
  warrcn-dukelv stirred and arose as
his keen ears caught a distant chanting
he awoke the slumbering doctor
  what the- mumbled the doctor
resentfully oh he sat up abruptly
oh lord yes id forgotten whats the
matter
  curtains going up old man pull
yourself together you stop here an dont
come out unless i call ive got to go an
parley with our pal yamala hes chant-
ing gilbert an sullivan stuff down there
ft
the tree of life	 
at the end of the grove
  what are they beginning already
not until sunset my magic is too
powerful for any except the anoiqted
sorcerers or whatever you like to call em
while the sun is up then the crowd
comes with a rush an they start with a
song an dance act
  but-dukely dyou think that theyve
already wiped out my camp that arab
of mine ali will put up a fight if he gets
any warning an hes no slouch
  god knows perhaps theyll bring him
up to see the show an-or-else they may
take it into their heads to keep him for
the next years magician-particularly if
hes a pure-blooded arab that is looks it
um if he knows hell fight like a wild-
cat fine chap ah even if he is tiresome
sometimes a smile twitched the doctors
shaggy eyebrows i hope they do bring
him along if only to see a carven image get
excited for once dear me how sentimental
one becomes in post-mortem contemplation
oh shut up exclaimed dukely sharply
then turning away abruptly look here
ill toddle along
  as he strode from the hut the little
doctor watched him keenly
  um he remarked sotto voce careless
of me-very nerves in rags still rather
natural um that food and sleep did
me good though his eyes wandered over
the ground and alighted on an empty pod
of the tree of life he picked it up and
sniffed at it again queer familiar odor
he stared reflectively at the glare of sun-
shine without -if  can recall what
it reminds me of um
  from without came warren-dukelys
voice pitched in the high native chant
as it ceased above the recurring buzz of
flies came the response like a thin streak
of troubled sound from a distance the
doctor moved toward the door and saw
the bearded white man turn away from the
fence to regard the giant tree he noted a cer-
tain rigidity in the body and the clenching
of the fists the doctor dodged back
swiftly as warren-dukely came to the
hut
  come on old man he shouted a trifle
boisterously its about an hour to sun-
set lets feed an ill fry some eggs
an goat we can stuff em in our pockets
for the trip tonight averting his eyes
he plumped down into the chair by the
library an by god we mustnt forget
to stir up the beer before-before the bar
opens
  certainly assented the doctor an
talkin about bars theres another wee
droppie left laddie
  thank heaven exclaimed dukely
lets drink to-to the holy estate of
matrimony by the lord
  um reflected the little doctor as he
unscrewed the flask hes fightin it
through but he may collapse on my hands
at any moment confound it what does
that stuff remind me of
dc
        in a field of malachite within a
wg canon of the basalt forest before
rj the domed majesty of the tree of
life was spread a quivering fan of ebony
whose writhing squirming figures were
sheened in the blue flood of the moon in
the center upon a carven stool was draped
the girth of the chief basayaguru upon
his left squatted his son basafingu and
upon his right a bearded face of ivory
and jet squatted the little doctor beside
the immobile carving in turquoise of ali
mohammed
  before them pranced yamala smeared
in clay a frenzied skeleton of chalcedony
from whose high-crested head streamed a
pennant of red parrot feathers dancing in
the humid air as if in wild pursuit of the
glittering snake which wras the sacred spear
to the screeching chant and the throb of the
drums beyond him beneath the great
bough in the blue womb of the tree was
the glimmer of a white body crouching
  around a wriggling group of the six
doomed and holy maidens leaped the men
and shuffled the wromen grunting and
squealing to the impulse of the drums
on every side like giant mushrooms stood
the great calabashes of the beer from which
he who willed could drink his fill
  god muttered the doctor nervously
plucking at his beard when is this con-
founded stuff going to work i dont even
know what reactions to look for ah
how far do you reckon that moonlight is
from mr dukely now
  undoubtedly within one foot doctor
the doctor glanced at the clear-cut
features which were as cold as rock and
he swore resentfully
i
adventure
  dukely shouted the doctor above
the racket are you all right
  yes came the reply in a steady voice
theyll get me in a minute or two
continuously the blue-sheened limbs
pranced on untiringly yelled hysteric
voices remorselessly the blue tide of the
moon rose nearer the bole of the tree of
life the mother of all where crouched the
unwilling bridegroom
  after an anxious stare about him the
doctor fidgeted restlessly and gazed fas-
cinatedly at die line of creeping moonlight
  is that stuff ever going to work ali
sharply dyou think weve made a mis-
take perhaps its merely harmless-just
citric acid of the baobab ali
  allah only knows responded ali tone-
lessly
  the doctor swore and began again to
pluck at his beard
  god uiis tensions-look he whis-
pered and clutched at alis robe
  the enormous bulk of the chief basaya-
guru beside him was heaving convulsively
the head was thrown back until the head-
dress was almost peqxndicular and the
mouth was wide open the jelly face creased
in a thousand winkles the eyes were
dilated flashing the blue whites the
blobby hands clutched at the flabby mass
of the strained throat
  he is drunk doctor said ah gravely
he wishes to laugh-exquisitely
 laugh good god what at ex-
claimed the doctor
  as he spoke the ghosdy figure of yamala
the witch-doctor doubled up in front of
him holding his sides as his open mouth
gasped in a paroxysm of laughter as sud-
denly as if indeed a magic wand had been
waved above them the drums ceased-the
screeches died away five leaping war-
riors turned in amazement and stared a
yell was turned into a gasping sob
  astonished the dot tor stood up every
savage except the six holy maidens was
rolling about in the grass holding his sides
and gasping with laughter the chief
beside his son was kicking his fat legs like
a baby hippopotamus into the moon-
light stepped the ivory figure of the bride-
groom several figures ceased to struggle
they lay quietly in the grass
  for gods sake began dukely what
on earth-
  come yelled the doctor run for it
dukely for your life ali and without ex-
planation the doctor sprang over the squirm-
ing figure of the chief followed by dukely
and the sedate ali not until thev had
reached the tree where the doctors gun
was hidden did he have breath to explain
  that smell course i knew it he
gasped as they trotted through the forest
to the canoes dentist

     a word from clyde b hough
     concerning his story in this issue
oakland calif
   at one time i spent a little over eleven months
on just such an island as is described in this story
the size of the island the reef completely around it
the birds and eggs and the method of obtaining
water are all statements of facts the island in the
story is a true accurate and complete reproduction

heres an answer to the inquiry about
cattle kate from one who knew her
and the circumstances of her hempen de-
parture heres hoping he tells us other
incidents of the old days of the west
denver colo
   used to ramble around the map a little myself
putting in about fifteen years of my life looking for
the place where the other fellow wasnt
qince settling down i get a lot of fun out of
our magazine and frequently read of men i
have whacked blankets with in various parts of the
west was acquainted with a lot of the old-time
gun-fighters who as a general rule were quiet un-
assuming men and the best of partners
   have been intending to write a few lines to camp-
fire for some time but kept putting it off until in a
recent issue some comrade inquired for information
of cattle kate and as i happened to know her
and a little of her history i thought you would be
interested
jate maxwell was bom north of des
moines iowa her father died when she was a
little girl her mother married again and died when
kate was about fifteen she continued to live with
her step-dad who abused her something shameful
until she was twenty when she ran away from home
tackling one job after another until she wound up
in a dance-hall kate arrived in wyoming and got
to running with a bunch of rustlers of which she was
soon the recognized leader
  i met her at her hang-out on the sweetwater
several months before she was lynched was
about forty-five years old with a face burnt the color
of old brick black hair streaked with gray flying
loose to the wind a mans coat and hat and two big
forty-fives and the grit of a wildcat
- was living with jim avery who i believe was
post-master at sweetwater six other hard cases
made up the gang kate being head and shoulders
the worst of the bunch as long as she kept to or-
dinary mailing the cattlemen overlooked her faults
later she got to shooting cows and running off the
dogies and then the mob got busy
in the spring of  a bunch of twenty men
 rode quietly up to her ranch the gang with
the exception of avery and her nephew were all
away surrounding the house part of the crowd
covered the three of them from the windows while
others broke in the door both avery and kate
were unarmed their belts hanging on the wall so
got no chance to do any shooting
  avery quit cold and begged but kate fought the
whole bunch bare-handed and the boy tried to knife
one and got a pistol-butt over the head and was out
of it
  the two were rushed out to the corral a wagon-
tongue hoisted in the air and both hung with the
same rope it is said that kate offered to fight the
entire mob with one pistol and was still cursing
them until the rope shut her off the rest of the
gang swore vengeance and in less than a year prac-
tically the whole mob had died with their boots on-
frank l schott
f i here follows a slightly different ver-
sion of the passing of cattle kate
both the names avery and averill
are used and theres also a word on
mccoy
shoshoni wyo
  i note in your last issue that l b w wants to
know something about cattle kale and some noto-
rious outlaw by the name of mccoy jim averill
who helped run the eighth standard parallel in this
state lived on the sweetwater river some time in
the last of the s with a woman by the name of
ella watson who had the nickname of cattle
kate she was a courtezan and while living with
averill plied her trade and some of the neighboring
punchers and owners paid her for favors received in
mavericks
yery also was a land surveyor and knew too
much about the choice bits of government
lands which some of the big cow outfits had fenced
up between these two tilings the hatred of some
of these outfits grew to such an extent that one day
when averill and ella were going to the then new
town of casper they were ambushed on the road
north of the sweetwater and near the mouth of dry
creek and both were hung on a tree which was still
standing some four years ago
  the required coroners inquest was held but the
paties were never prosecuted it was a cowardly
and dastardly crime cattle kate was written up

io
adventure
in lhe newspapers in luril and fanciful colors as a
dashing cowgirl dead shot and a few other things
there was nothing to that but hot air
  as for mccoy the only one answering to the de-
scription was bob mccoy of therutopolis who was
killed some few years ago uhder peculiar circum-
stances he was shot by unknown parties his
body then dragged to the river edge and a nosebag
strapped around his head and then the body a far
as the shoulders put under water hob was sup-
posed to be pretty swift in the use of a rope other-
wise he was not a particularly hard citizen- - -
xuldnt it be a sort of good idea
  	 for our magazine to have a kind of
emblem or sign or whatever you want to
call it an adventure its mark affair
might use it on its stationery some day and
there are various little purposes for which it
might come in handy tried it out for
example on the preceding page here it
is in large size-a kind of coat-of-arms ar-
rangement does it get by
our camp-fire is the best agency in
existence for collecting hitherto un-
published chanteys ballads and other sea-
songs and rescuing them before they are
lost forever its another job for us and
one as interesting as it is worth while
  we have been fortunate in getting to
aid us in this work the friendly cooperation
of john f lomax who is perhaps the best
authority on this subject with him as
guide and expert we can be sure that what
we collect will be assessed at its right
and full value
  whenever any of you sends in a hitherto
unpublished chantey or sea-song or a ballad
of the great lakes or erie canal well try
to have it at our camp-fire for the benefit
of all of us and we hope that later on
mr lomax will have enough of them to
embody in a book for still more permanent
keeping
   of course original productions have no
place in this collodion
   some time in the future we might try
our hand at collecting unpublished cowboy
songs and songs of the old west in general
and perhaps the lumberjack songs some
day
   some of the songs are of course too broad
to be printable but some of these have
merits that offset that point and if you
have any of lhe latter no doubt mr lomax
will be interesled in them 
tpollowing is a list of the published
chanteys and songs so far as accessible
in lhe new york public library these
we do not want what we are afler is
lhose lhal have not yet been preserved
in prinl
   if you know any that are not in the
following list please send them to mr
lomax y m c a building austin

handled and classified and that the suitable
ones come lo us for camp-fire if you
can send music wilh words so much lhe

a nother definition of the spirit of
adventure though whether it is bio-
logically considered i have my doubts
but then im a bit shaky as to just what
biologically considered means when it
comes right down to brass tacks
                                  bermuda
in the march issue i saw a quoted opinion of
jai k london on this subject and the late famous
yam-spinner uttered a thought so widely at variance
with my own ideas that i am giving you in brief my
conccption of the adventure spirit as it has affected
and still affects myself
the camp-fire	
  curiosity pure and simple-thats the adventure
spirit somewhere beyond the limit of physical
vision lies the unknown the supposedly inaccessible
comes curiosity curiosity proves too strong for
mental fear though it may give a sharp jolt to mere
physical courage and out goes the adventurer
bound to satisfy his curiosity even at the cost of
his life even though the object prove after all a
will-o-the-wisp the adventure lies not in the
finding but in the seeking while yet the goal re-
mains unseen and unknown and the adventurer
is a great or small adventurer in the proportion
by which curiosity conquers fear
  such is my notion of the spirit which moves so
many men to perform otherwise unaccountable
actions i know it is so in my own case let some
one tell me that there is some place i can not reach
something i can not do and up rises all powerful
curiosity what is it where if foot free
i want immediately to have a go-a e dingle
a dainty morsel from henry oyen of
our writers brigade
  just noticed in one of the recent numbers of
adventure that theres mention of liver-eating
johnson of the yellowstone country did your
correspondent tell you how he got his name dont
think it was because he had a weakness for liver
and far be it from such  have it straight
from a man who hunted with him a few years before
he died johnson played king to his neck of the coun-
try and there was only one young indian a chey-
enne chief who dared to defy him said chief
raided and burned johnsons camp once while
johnson was away at his traps the- said
johnson when he returned and saw the ruins ill
eat his liver and tradition saith he made good
the threat-oyen
 a s previously announced ourcamp-
fire buttons are now ready for de-
livery i think theres going to be no
doubt as to a big demand for them at
this writing the first announcement of
their being ready has not reached you
yet requests have been coming in right
along though uie askers had only the
vague preliminary announcements to go
on without knowing price or date of de-
livery as the buttons were delivered
to us long before we could notify you in
print we have been sending them out to
these early seekers there will be enough
for all though this first order may be
exhausted before long more will be ordered
before it entirely disappears and now that
the die is made re-orders will not take so
long
  the button or badge is small neat in-
conspicuous and yet individual and easily
seen enamel with gold-washed edgings
round three-eighths of an inch in diameter
screw-back with a clinch pin to hold in
place three fields blue brown and green
for sky earth and sea the numeral 
is the only lettering or design of any kind
that appears on the badge  being the
sum of the letters of camp-fire when
assigned their numerical positions in the
alphabet
  membership in our camp-fire is open
to any one who has the desire to be a com-
rade there is no ceremony of admission
and any member may apply for a badge
they are sent out at cost price  cents
covering badge and return postage to any
part of the world
  im glad the badges are assured of a
strong demand there is a good idea
back of their use and the badges themselves
will i think win favor when you see them
personally ill be glad when i can locate
a comrade among apparent strangers and
i think most of us feel the same way
tn response to a camp-fire sugges-
- tion a number of you have written
in their own experiences in getting out of
the clutches of old mr demon rum no
preaching you understand were not con-
ducting any temperance crusade just
plain facts given on the chance they may
be of practical help to other comrades who
are trying to cut it out here is one
of the letters it is our comrade e e
harriman of our writers brigade and ask
adventure to whom he refers
pasadena calif
   for several years having the restless foot wan-
dered around the country and very naturally
picked up booze first came malaria then a
morning drink which soon grew into a quart a
day the fever was not cured so i visited hot
springs ark taking four months water cure
it proved a success for i have never had the fever
since but the booze appetite remained
   for several years i hit it up pretty hard then
tried to quit and i guess i swore off several hundred
times only to go back again i never reached the
bum a drink stage but came very close
tree years ago i decided it was either quit
or go under for i am a lunger and have been
for twelve years and booze was not helping me
knowing i could not stand the pace much longer
i rolled my bed and struck out for trinity county
calif landing in hyampom a valley not a town
   as far as the eye could reach there was nothing
but pines and mountains valleys and streams
the sort of country that lifts a man out of himself
raises him to a higher plane and makes him dean
whether he wants to or not i spent four months
in and close to hyampom fishing hunting and
hiking  forgot about booze and to thic day
i have no desire for it and do not drink even beer
adventure
 
  understand me i ant no anti-booze man but
i have seen some fine men go under from it and
i know from experience that old john b has a fierce
kick he always wins if you stay long enough
yyhillv on the subject let me tell you something
     about the trip
  two of us left here on sept   by auto
and on arriving in red bluff hired a truck and
driver to take us and our outfit to hayfork about
one hundred and fifty miles from hayfork to
hyampom on foot without outfit on mule back
about thirty miles we walked about twenty
miles i guess for we rode to the end of the highway
about eight miles
  when we reached hyampom my booze-soaked
muscles were screaming with pain we spent the
night at a mr butlers and early the next morning
started for the summit of hayfork mountain where
we intended camping a few days to enjoy some real
good hunting
  dont think i will say much about that trip
for i always want to go back to bed and rest when-
ever it comes into my mind we made it all right
and after a short rest took a look at the country
j ll never forget the first sunset and you know
this country is noted for its beautiful sunsets
of which i have seen many but nothing to equal
that one can you imagine hundreds of miles
of country standing on end thickly covered with
pine trees and every known color and shade and
many unknown covering the whole thing can
you imagine the west a blaze of color and the east
tinted yellow with a great big moon well that
is what i saw only it dont come anywhere near
telling you of the wonderful beauty
  i tell you a man couldnt be anything but clean
in this country
kjever saw so many deer in my life or such
streams of fish rainbow steel-head and
salmon trout quail and grouse are positively
thick believe me its a mans country i am
crazy to go back but cant get enough money
together i work two or three months then have
to rest the same length of time some day i hope
to collect the correct amount and believe me i will
hike for trinity locate a homestead and live
  if you care to use this hop to it only please
dont use my name
jdy the way to come jback lo the booze ques-
tion tell any chap who wants to quit to go
see mr harriman just to look at him will make
anything on two legs straighten his shoulders and
take a brace he sure is a mans man and then
some he is au man
  if any one ever asks anything about trinity
county let me know i sure will boost
  excuse me for taking up so much of your time
but thoughts of trinity send me back to the trails
i dearly love---
	i he federal board for vocational edu-
cation  new jersey avenue north-
west washington d c sent us a state-
ment of the many practical helps and
services they offer in reeducating disabled
soldiers and sailors but there is not spat 
to print them all concisely stated though
they are artificial limbs free free medical
treatment after discharge for disability
incurred in service free vocational training
with war-risk insurancprovision cover-
ing period of training and period of further
disability help toward suitable positions
following training etc fourteen district
offices through the country
  if you were disabled in service make sure
that you know definitely and in full all
the many things the board will do to help
you personally i was amazed at the
extent of the service offered but all that
service was fully and honestly earned by
those in need of it and it would be only
childish and wrong lo refuse the service
because of any mistaken pride you might
just as well refuse the  charity of a decora-
tion for valor
the adventures of our identification-
  - cards in the great war-if collected
what a book they would make here is a
sample from a letter written before hos-
tilities ceased
warrington england
   it may interest you to receive a friendly word
 from one who has carried one of adventures serial
 idenlification-cards in his pocket for many years
 the card remains with me yet but as it is in the safe
 of this hospital along with other papers of value
 masonic certificates etc i can not give you its
 number
   nevertheless it has traveled via canada from
boston u s a over to the camps of blighty and
the wastes of franee where its bearer has during the
past two years alternated between laying rails for
france iindcr general jack stewart and dodging
jerrys shrapnel bombs flying pigs and many
of the other pleasant surprises jerry entertains
our boys with
   your card was present at the battle of vimy april
  at the cambrai push of november  in the
 big retreat of march  and between times was
 all over the place in the terrain bounded by arras
 cambrai peronne amiens paris abbeville and the
 channel coast quite a big territory to cover em-
 bracing nearly all of the ancient domains of picardy
 and artois somme battlefield it was never
 have dumas romances seemed so real as when i
 saw bcthune le fdre beauvais etc etc ad lib-

oomething for us to be considering
 wouldnt it be a fine thing if we could
gradually establish camp-fire stations
or local headquarters all over the map
a place where we could register ourselves
or leave word for a comrade who would
or might follow later or run a good chance
looking ahead
of meeting other wandering or resident
comrades
nothing pretentious just a station
which might be in a tobacco-shop or any
old place that was reputable bar-rooms
and such barred oh yes i know the
objections to barring them but this matter
for democracy	
has to be considered from the general aspect
and there are sound reasons for not making
bar-rooms our permanent and official
homes
how about it yes or no if yes what
suggestions
-arthur sullivant hoffman
looking
ahead
for
democracy
jy the time this readies you in print we shall
know the result of the call for action on june
twenty-fifth i do not expect that the world will
be set on fire but t do hope that here and there
some seeds will be sown some publidty given to
the needed work and enough workers enlisted to
form the nucleus of an organization that itself is
built on democratic lines
  a choice had to be made first organize by the
usual method with the usual backing from men with
money and the usual control by a few men at the
head it is the easier method and far more likely
to succeed than the second but it would lie trying
to further real democracy by an organization that
is itself an autocracy so the second mediod was
chosen despite the fact that it is almost impossible
to make much headway at first by means of it at
least it does not betray democracy from the start
and in the long run it will be of more avail
  the movement must be from the people them-
selves of them by them at all times under their
control better a small right one than a big wrong
one
gince this is being written in the middle of
may there can be no guessing whether the
response to the call will be very small or fairly con-
siderable but there is always the fact that even a
few seeds sown will be working-in ways no man
can measure-the right leaven into the national fer-
ment sooner or later enough of the people to be
effective will see the need and take hold
  so far as i personally am concerned i have done
what little i could in the way that seemed soundest
and there is nothing more that i can do except con-
tinue preaching and working in a small way little
enough but  am only one american you are
another there are many millions of us it is no
more my work than it is yours or any other ameri-
cans it lies with you fully as much as with any-
body else
tust what shape this department will take from
j now on  do not know many interesting let-
ters have come in proving the seriousness witli
which many americans are considering the road
ahead of this people perhaps we can make the
department a torum you will remember that it
was started as a forum but the war being not yet
over there were not enough who saw the coming
problems of peace to keep it going now it is dif-
ferent the future has become the present the
difficulty would be in selecting from so many opin-
ions on so many subjects letters for print m such
way that balance and fair hearing could be main-
tained in our small space
  the department will have to be worked out as it
goes along-a s h

british east africa
if you mean to go a-roaming dont land
on the east african coast expecting to
pick up a job simply because youre a
white man mr beadle explains why a
white can only boss
question-i woukl like to ask you about british
east africa what are the opportunities for ad-
venture and sport are there many dangerous
reptiles and animals there
  what arc the living conditions for white men
there what would the opportunities be for two
healthy boys-harold hibbard portland me
  answer by mr beadle-in answer to your first
question british east africa is one of if not the
greatest countries for sport in africa big game
ask adventure
and small adventure too if you arc made that
way and are lucky
  there are quite a number of dangerous reptiles
crocodiles and many kinds of snakes the black
mamba is the most deadly and of animals lion
in plenty rhinoceros buffalo elephant and
leopard
  white men there do only boss jobs all other
work is done by natives indians or goanese a
half-breed from the island of goa india so for
the answer to lhe last question i am sorry that
i can not encourage you to go there until you have
a profession or trade-and then such profession or
trade would be limited to a few such as rubber
planting fiber or as agent for some commercial
firm and then you would have little opportunity
for adventure or shooting native trading is no
good now as the indians compete against the white
man
the sunken lands of arkansas
did you know the mississippi once ran
up-stream or that the famous re-
cently reclaimed farming land in the
sunken country of northeastern arkansas
was the result of a great earthquake still
remembered by oldest inhabitants you
may want to take a fishing or hunting trip
there- or even to buy a farm in this super-
fertile section
  question-please give me some information
regarding big lake arkansas is it a govt
game preserve can one fish there
  also what and where are the sunken lands of
missouri and arkansas is there good farming
land there has the land been reclaimed-
f r sptegielle charles city iowa
  answer by mr thompson-there are sunken
lands in both southeast missouri and northern
arkansas the greatest missouri tract is in the
overflow formed by cane creek and little black
river those best known to the writer are in
mississippi county arkansas
  big lake arkansas is a government preserve
you can fish there but commercial fishing is under
control of the government it is formed by the
widening of little river and was for many years
the source of much rivalry between clubs and
market hunters and was the largest shipping
section for wild ducks in the u s
  the sunken lands commence a little below cape
girardeau missouri and extend into most of north-
eastern arkansas the present conditions were
created by the earthquake of  when the land
sunk and earthquakes were felt at intervals for
almost a year audubon the naturalist made
considerable note of it for a short time the
mississippi river ran up-stream until drainage
ensued creating the most fertile farming area on
the globe it was a wilderness of swamp and of
veritable fish and game paradise similar con-
ditions prevailed in southern tennessee and reel-
foot lake is a result of the earthquake
  for years it supported a population of market
hunters fishermen and trappers these were
recently forced to other pursuits when inundated
lands were redeemed
i
rifles and six-guns
perhaps the rifle won the west per-
haps the six-gun then again both
may have lent a hand anyhow here is
a lot of interesting comment by two men
who know what theyre talking about
  question-just to get in on this gun chatter
let me say that i learned to use a gun at the tender
age of  in the big timber of minnesota the
first time that i ever fired a gun was away prior
to that time however my mother sister and
three brothers had allowed me to visit the sugar
camp with them on the way to camp my oldest
brother shot a ruffled grouse-partridge we called
them
  he reloaded the single-barreled harpers ferry
smoothbore set it against the log cabin and began
to gather sap all the rest moved off i tackled
the gun got it over a small log braced my belly
against the butt locked both middle fingers over
the trigger and-gosh how quick i sat down
i had to set the butt on the ground and cock the
gun by pushing down with both hands but i had
done it
  i scared the women folks crazy got a shaking
from frank my senior had a sore spot on my front
elevation but lordy how big i felt
  i have hunted with mississippi yaegers ken-
tucky squirrel rifles the old harpers ferry gun
for years with paper cartridge sharps that
carried an ounce round ball with belgian muskets
with ballards colts wessons henry spencer
l c smith shotgun with winchesters as i
write three winchesters hang above me on the wall
 special - and a - meat-getter as
harry knibbs calls it
  having had a half century of gun experience
i claim to be there to a certain extent with knowl-
edge of weapons and  smiled with a sincere pleasure
when i read what chas beadle said in the february
rd issue a  automatic will kick itself up if
hred rapidly till it shoots far above the target
i have tried them out on the beverly hill gun
club range and have had numerous others try
them while i watched there arc few men who
can hold one down to its work and rattle off the
shots at the same speed that a fair gunman with
a good old six-gun s a when spotting his bull
every crack
  i have seen a man who had used an automatic
for a year try both on a -yard target and his
score rapid fire was  per cent better with the
old gun then one of the boys who had an auto-
matic and boasted of its excellence tried six shots
at speed and his last shot went out at about 
degrees above the target each shot kicking it
higher he simply could not hold it down
  i own two d a six-guns but i always use
them as s a weapons in case some guy bats
me over the head and climbs my frame i may use
the self-cocking device to save his feelings but not
otherwise i agree with chester but here is a
point for the novice who wants to learn get to
know the feel and hang of your gun just as a me-
chanic learns a tool a good carpenter ran drive
a nail straight while he looks away from it if
you know your gun right it flips on the bull as it
comes from the holster at any short range in-
stinctively

adventure
   lake ihe empty gun in the privacy of your own
 room and practise drawing and throwing down on

  my experience with the - s  w
i once drilled a jack rabbit through the head at

in a dazed fashion till i caught him never upset

   in the argument concerning which gun opened
up the west i say the rifle the six-gun was the
scrappers gun the gun for brawls and murders
and for most of the arrests by officers but the rifle
did the bulk of the real work in making buck
injuns absent and varmints scary let the ultra-
modern hoot at the winchester and praise his ross

  in the russo-turkish war there were many
russians killed at over two miles range by dropping
fire from - winchesters a gun that
will do that is no slouch of a cannon remember
what the mine superintendent said in the led
horse claim-a winchester is a mighty com-
prehensive weapon and many a pioneer thanked
his gods that it was so when he was up against
red or white outlaws many such have found
the rifle a better weapon properly handled than
a six-gun-e e harriaian los angeles calif
  answer by mr wiggins-mr harri mans
experience with automatics seems to be similar to
many others of which i know i think the revolver
at high speed lines up more naturally and accurately
than the automatic the double action is beyond
all doubt quicker than the single action i con-
sider either one preferable to an automatic for
serious work
   a good shot will draw a revolver and hit a can
 from three to six shots when the can is thrown in the
 air the revolver being drawn after it was thrown
 also the revolver caliber for caliber seems to have
 more killing effect than the automatic due to the
 soft lead bullet of the revolver expanding slightly
   i have never known of an instance where the
bullet from a  colt failed to knock a man off
his feet i do not thinkthe -  is the equal
of the  special for stopping power
   there is no doubt that the rifle killed off most of
 the bad characters but i think the credit should
 go to col colt for origination of the multi-shot
 weapon i recollect an instance of a horse thief
 being killed wjth a  colt at a distance of l
yards short range weapon eh
british honduras
  a pparently its up to some venture-
some soul to penetrate the jungles
and ranges of this little known land and
find out what its like the natives wont
theyre too lazy anyhow there is always
a strange compelling fascination about an
unexplored country therefore we give
you the following 
   question-can you give me some general
information about british honduras  am espe-
cially interested in the chances for placer mining
 there
   what is its topography chief industry and
population what sort of natives might one
expect lo find
   has the interior been explored what arc its
imports-l s d tensacola fla
answer by mr young-area  kilometers
   population 
capital beliz or bclice population 
   exports a little mahogany rubber fruits and
 hides
    imports small quantities of cotton fabrics flour
 implements etc principally from the u s a
   geography low lying for the most part with
 a few hills known as die cockscombs mountain
 forming the highest elevations a view from the
 top of victoria mt to the east shows at close
 hand a number of thickly wooded hills about three
 hundred feet high and dropping abruptly to a
 flat swampy tropical jungle marked here and
 there with sluggish rivers and streams beyond
 and beyond would be the coast and a chain
 of islands paralleling it no human being could
 ever see tins far in british honduras for a clear
 day is a rare thing due to the excessive rainfall
 at all seasons the actual temperature is not high
 ranging from  to  centigrade but on account
 of the humidity it is very oppressive and quickly
 saps the vitality it is possibly for this reason
 that the inhabitants of british honduras are easily
 the laziest of all central america
 y there are very few white people in british
 honduras the bulk of the population is negro
 and mulatto who speak a poor kind of english
 which puzzles a newcomer a few pure carib
 indians mixed carib-ncgro breeds and spanish-
 indian or spanish-negro mixtures the entire
 colony is sparsely settled and is distributed as
 follows district of beliz  corozal 
 orange walk  stann creek  toledo
  and cayo 
    very utile is known of the interior of this country
 as small as it is the people are too lazy to go back
 into it and see what it is like they are content
 to roll around in filth and idleness and uve prin-
 cipauy on fish and the natural fruits and nuts of
 the near-by jungles the british government
 keeps a few negro soldiers from jamaica stationed
 at various points to preserve order the colony
 is ruled by a governor assisted by a congress of ten
lost
members the negroes of the colony are allowed
to elect a queen which they do with great pomp
  the natives along the coast barter back and forth
among themselves each coast town having a flotilla
of canoes tied in front of it and quite a bit of turtle
shell is sold to local traders who export it to this
country in the hill country com rice manioc
from which tapioca is made cotton aloe coffee
cacao chocolate oranges bananas rubber
pepper and many other products thrive easily
the price of land government crown land is nom-
inally fixed at five dollars a hectare over two acres
  traces of gold silver and lead have been found
in some of the creeks of this country but nothing
of any note the formation of the cockscombs
is a hard granite with quartz veins cropping out
in places hunting placer ground is a rather tedious
process due to the heavy growth of jungle
  the lowland was once sea-bottom and was doubt-
less built up to its present level by coral growth
there have been a few small placer operations
at various points in the colony but i have never
heard of one that amounted to much for my
part t would not suggest british honduras if you
are thinking of trying to locate placer ground or
dredging ground however it will only cost you
a  tax to try it out that is what the govern-
ment charges for prospecting license and if you
find anything you must declare it immediately
have it surveyed by a government surveyor and pay
royalty on each ounce mined
  the laws of spanish honduras are much more
liberal spanish and not british honduras would
be my suggestion for prospecting several of
my answers regarding this country have been
printed in adventure magazine during the past
two years write to the pan-american union
washington d c for the booklet honduras-
general descriptive data for general information
also write department of commerce latin-
american division washington d c for supple-
ments to commerce reports covering spanish

the original seven seas
 perhaps some of you may have still
 a different explanation of the origin
 of the term seven seas here are two
 though no fixed definition can be found
 anyone is entitled to his own theory
    question-be so good as to inform me what the
  expression the seven seas signifies
   what seven seas are meant how and when did
 the term originate-geo m klein vicksburg
 mississippi	 
   atirwer by captain dingle--the term seven
 seas is hard to trace to its absolute source there
 are almost as many definitions and dales of origin
 as there are waves on those seven seas one of the
 most general suppositions is that the term embraces
 the five oceans and the carribbean and medi-
 teranean seas which in bygone days were seas of
 distinct trades for example ships plied the great
 oceans on distant voyages or exploring cruises
 while the mediterranean and caribbean seas were
 sufficiently well known to have established firms
 trading to them with their vessels the levanters
 and west indiamen
    there was another selection of seas which many
  understood to be the seven but the reason is not
  very bright unless one remembers that sailors in
  days before steam made some very eventful voyages
  in remote regions and were apt to recall such voy-
  ages by events that affected their ship-such as
  pirates in the china seas savages in the south seas
  slavers in the arabian sea etc these other seven
  seas were the mediterranean caribbean baltic
  arabian north china and south seas
    personally although the evidence is not so dear
  to a landsman i lean to the latter explanation
  but there is not a fixed definition to be found that
  i have even discovered so it remains after all greatly
  a matter of opinion if not guesswork

  funny thing about money a half dollar
looks different every time you lift it out of
your pocket its hardly big enough to
cotint when you are taking a girl to a show
and supper but next day it looks like a mil-
lion dollars when you invest it at a lunch
counter
  the more it buys the harder it is to
spend
  all of which is suggested by what a mil-
lionaire said to me the other day-as free
a spender as i ever passed a hotel evening
with-
    look here jim he said i cant
    see that  cent size of mennens
    -its too much coin to spend at one
    time for shaving cream
    but its a bigger tube i protested
   you get more for your money than
   in the regular  cent size
   i know he answered slipping
   half a dollar to the waiter but 
   cents is my price for shaving
   cream
  aint human nature wonderful
  in our fifty cent tube of mennens theres
enough shaving cream to bring peace and
the joy of living into a mans life every
morning for
  enough cream to soften the meanness out
of two seasons crops of stubble
  and a quality of shaving cream so fine so
unusual so remarkable-
  -say have you ever tried mennens
shaving cream have you taken a half
inch on a drenched brush and whipped it
for three minutes into a creamy firm moist
lather-with the brush only-using a lot
of water hot or cold-
  -and then slipped the razor down the
east facade of your jaw in the most deli-
ciously glorious shave of your career
  youve got to know mennens to like it
send me  cents and ill mail a demon-
strator tube try it  then reason with
yourself calmly if many months of such
